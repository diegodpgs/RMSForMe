1
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,760
Guess what.

2
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,595
What?

3
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:58,734
I can't move.

4
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:04,001
Yeah, well, you don't have to.
You're in a car.

5
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:11,810
Am I driving?

6
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:14,946
Like a pro.

7
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:08,637
Come on, wake up, you fuck.
Come on.

8
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,147
Did you try to help him get free?

9
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,781
Briefly.

10
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,388
Briefly?

11
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,687
When it came down to it, my life
was more important to me than his.

12
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,160
Selfish, huh?

13
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,736
We found these...

14
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,074
...in your Spider.

15
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,215
Actually, I don't drive a Spider
anymore.

16
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,783
Now I have a C8 Laviolette.

17
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:54,045
It's lighter, faster...

18
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,155
...swims better.

19
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:19,912
Right.

20
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:22,777
These three contain traces
of ketamine...

21
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:25,886
...the same as we found in your blood
and his.

22
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:31,288
This one had pure D-Tubocurarine,
DTC...

23
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:34,156
...which we only found in him.

24
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:37,394
Must've been something
he took at the party.

25
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,091
No. DTC is not a party drug.

26
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:43,678
Along with the other stuff in his blood,
it paralyzed his lungs.

27
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:46,101
Kevin Franks did not drown.

28
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,145
He had already stopped breathing
by the time you drove off the road.

29
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:53,651
He was breathing
when we went off the road.

30
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:54,852
How do you know?

31
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,337
He was making me come.

32
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:01,751
What? You were having sex
at 100 miles an hour?

33
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:05,894
Hundred and ten.
I must've hit a pothole.

34
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,463
Your friend, Dickie Pep...

35
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:14,331
...says he sold you 15 milliliters
of DTC last Thursday.

36
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,236
I don't know any Dickie Pep,
but he's lying.

37
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:19,467
Or you are.

38
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:20,880
Why would he lie?

39
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,480
You got him on some other charge
and he's trying to deal his way out.

40
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:25,948
If he even exists.

41
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,790
You don't seem too upset by what's
happened.

42
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:35,222
Of course I am, I'm traumatized.

43
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,159
Who knows if I'll ever come again?

44
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,595
I want that cunt in jail.

45
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:47,603
We haven't got a case, Roy.

46
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:51,904
Well, just fucking make one. Please.

47
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:54,672
They'll order a psychiatric for bail.

48
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:57,716
I'll make sure we get somebody
good and tough.

49
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:25,837
Dr. Glass. I'm Henry Rose,
Miss Tramell's solicitor.

50
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,278
This is Catherine Tramell.

51
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:31,515
I shall be present during
the evaluation.

52
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:33,884
Well, that's fine by me.

53
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,459
I'll be asking fairly personal questions.
If she doesn't mind your presence....

54
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:41,961
My client understands and agrees
I should be present for--

55
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:45,225
Maybe Dr. Glass is right
and we should be alone for this.

56
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:48,303
I strongly advise you
not to contemplate having--

57
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:51,168
So is this where
we're going to do it?

58
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:09,753
Mr. Rose told you the purpose
of this evaluation.

59
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:12,328
I'm applying for bail in a murder case.

60
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:16,365
The Crown wants to know
if I'm a danger to myself or others.

61
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:19,628
You're the Crown's shrink,
so you'll say I'm dangerous.

62
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:22,988
My shrink will say I'm not,
and the judge will flip a coin.

63
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:27,643
Anything you tell me can be quoted
verbatim in testimony...

64
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,349
...and can affect your case.

65
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:31,184
You can quote me all you want.

66
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,151
Thank you.

67
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:36,884
Well, I see that you're a writer.

68
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:39,916
What do you write about?

69
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,857
Murder, sex, violence.

70
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:45,293
Do you ever write about yourself?

71
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:47,467
Not into autobiography.

72
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:48,999
Really? Why not?

73
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:53,435
Maybe I like to just sit back and get
other people to reveal themselves.

74
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:59,110
For instance,
you look a little divorced.

75
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:01,741
What makes you think I'm divorced?

76
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,043
The ring line hasn't faded.

77
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:08,712
You're very observant.

78
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:10,824
Yeah, but am I wrong?

79
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:13,297
Would it bother you
if you were wrong?

80
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,556
Would it bother you if I was right?

81
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:23,662
T ell me something you're afraid of.

82
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,837
Boredom.

83
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,116
Is that why you like to take risks?

84
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,146
I do like to take risks.

85
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:38,651
Like taking drugs and having sex
in a speeding car?

86
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,881
Like talking to me
without having your lawyer present?

87
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,795
Actually, that was your idea.

88
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:50,194
Like being on trial for murder? That's
risky. You could end up in prison.

89
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,668
Not if I'm innocent.

90
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:54,233
Innocent people end up in prison
all the time.

91
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:57,867
Not rich, innocent people who are
represented by Henry Rose.

92
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:01,307
In that case, it isn't really exciting
unless you're guilty.

93
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:09,478
Oh, I bet you like to take risks,
don't you, Dr. Glass?

94
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:12,252
But I'm not the one who's on trial
for murder.

95
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:13,857
Not yet.

96
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,993
Sorry, you're not allowed
to smoke in here.

97
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:33,211
You know what I like about you?

98
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,211
You enjoy being in control.

99
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:43,812
Like me.

100
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:00,839
Sorry, sir. Can't let you through here.

101
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:06,310
Well, I would say extremely intelligent.
Gifted, accomplished.

102
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:08,016
Yet inside, I believe...

103
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:11,611
...she vacillates between
a feeling of godlike omnipotence...

104
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,618
...and a sense
that she simply doesn't exist...

105
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:17,018
...which, of course, is intolerable.

106
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:21,059
Do you consider Miss Tramell to be
mentally impaired?

107
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:24,199
Not by legal definition, no. Not at all.

108
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,837
If released, is she likely
to commit a violent crime?

109
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:34,006
I believe her behavior is driven
by what we call a risk addiction.

110
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:37,919
A compulsive need to prove to herself
that she can take risks...

111
00:12:38,114 --> 00:12:40,229
...and survive dangers others can't.

112
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:45,344
Especially the subsequent encounters
with the police or the powers that be.

113
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:47,499
Why would a person do that?

114
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,255
The greater the risk, the greater the
proof of her omnipotence.

115
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,720
Her existence, really.

116
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:57,458
When you say she has
a risk addiction...

117
00:12:57,668 --> 00:13:00,137
...is this condition likely to get
worse?

118
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,006
All addiction is progressive.

119
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,571
The addict always needs to take
greater risks.

120
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:07,210
If other people are hurt or killed...

121
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,779
...as a result of her behavior,
that's not likely to stop her?

122
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:13,507
I think the only thing
that'd stop her....

123
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,157
I suspect the only limit for her
would be her own death.

124
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:26,888
Then she is a danger to herself.

125
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,197
Yes, I believe she is.

126
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:40,145
Nice work, Michael. Well done.

127
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:45,214
Dr. Glass, did Catherine Tramell
kill Kevin Franks?

128
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:47,852
No, I can't make any comment, sorry.

129
00:13:48,054 --> 00:13:50,420
Can you please tell us about the bail?

130
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:57,228
Dr. Michael Glass. What a big thing
you are all of a sudden.

131
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:01,925
What are you doing here, Adam?
Don't say you're writing about Tramell.

132
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:05,106
A sexy, omnipotent killer
with a Random House contract.

133
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:06,474
Why would I write that?

134
00:14:06,474 --> 00:14:08,242
You don't know she's a killer.

135
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:11,838
No, but I hope she is, though.
I mean, I pray to God she is.

136
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:15,073
By the way, I hear you were
brilliant in there.

137
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:18,447
You're so lucid sometimes,
it's just disgusting.

138
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:20,815
You thought about daytime television?

139
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:24,550
Denise always says you were born
for the small screen.

140
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,456
And how is my wife these days?
Having fun?

141
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:30,997
Ex-wife, Michael. Ex-wife.

142
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,567
While we're chatting about killers...

143
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,864
...is there any chance of talking about
George Cheslav?

144
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:38,973
Who told you about Cheslav?

145
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,403
Denise?

146
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,875
That's got to be any shrink's worst
nightmare.

147
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,141
A patient in your care
suddenly runs amok...

148
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:49,420
...beats his girlfriend to death
with a brick.

149
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,082
That was seven years ago,
why talk about it now?

150
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:55,281
Not quite seven, actually.
Seven in July.

151
00:14:55,492 --> 00:15:00,452
But you talked to him twice a week.
He never indicated he'd harm the girl?

152
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:03,098
I don't talk about my patients.

153
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,998
Cheslav's dead. Can't you talk
about them when they're dead?

154
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,901
No, not even when they're dead.

155
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,140
Michael, what are you doing here?

156
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,473
What did you tell Adam T owers
about George Cheslav?

157
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,110
Nothing.

158
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,514
Can you give us a minute?

159
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,642
He already knew.

160
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:58,116
Really? Because he said you told him.

161
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:00,419
No, all I said was--

162
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:04,064
If he writes about that, if he puts it
on his magazine cover--

163
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:06,425
He won't. You're just being paranoid.

164
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,136
You didn't do anything wrong.

165
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:12,470
Right. I didn't. I was treating a patient
that killed his pregnant girlfriend.

166
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,576
End of story.
You make sure he gets that.

167
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:17,143
Don't worry.

168
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,697
I'm up for the Douglas Chair
at the university.

169
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,792
You know what that means to me.
Do you think this is going to help?

170
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:33,929
I can't tell Adam what to write.

171
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:34,931
Why not?

172
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,299
Don't be stupid.

173
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:40,235
I think you're entitled to since you've
been fucking him for over a year.

174
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:43,372
Do you think I didn't know
when it started?

175
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:47,100
It's a pity you never asked yourself
why it started.

176
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:59,321
How was the court case
with the mystery writer?

177
00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:01,222
I hear she looks fabulous.

178
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:05,159
Also very intelligent.
Pathological liar. Narcissistic.

179
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:07,661
Seductive, manipulative.

180
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:10,115
Do you think she killed the footballer?

181
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:11,370
I have no idea.

182
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,396
Everything she does is so perfectly
composed.

183
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:17,074
It's designed to confuse
or confound you.

184
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:21,371
You never know what's truth
and what isn't. She's brilliant, really.

185
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,695
The masked psychotic. Your favorite.

186
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:27,460
I'm already working it into a paper:
"Risk Addiction and Omnipotence."

187
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:28,955
You're writing another already?

188
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:31,491
I'm writing two,
but this is the more interesting.

189
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:33,186
I'll catch you up.

190
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:34,690
Hello?

191
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:38,489
Glass? It's Roy Washburn.
Are you near a television set?

192
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:41,462
If you'll be quiet, I'll make a
statement.

193
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:42,792
What happened?

194
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,275
The judge let her go.

195
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:45,572
Let her go? Why?

196
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:47,836
The guy who said
he sold her the DTC...

197
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:51,345
... the judge found out he 'd perjured
himself in another case...

198
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:55,076
... and disqualified him as a witness.
But I'll make you a bet.

199
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,317
What's that?

200
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:57,878
She 'll do it again.

201
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,043
And soon.

202
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:03,247
Only this time
I will fucking nail the bitch.

203
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,376
So we've been considering those who
wish to control others...

204
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:28,675
...through their insecurity and their
narcissism.

205
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:33,321
T o study Nietzsche
psychobiographically may seem naive.

206
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:35,952
Wasn't it Nietzsche's work itself,
which...

207
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,320
...through deconstructive and
post-structuralist readings...

208
00:18:39,396 --> 00:18:41,921
...induced the death of
psychobiography?

209
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:51,238
Paul Portman said he might go
to T avistock. I'm thinking I might go.

210
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,899
Just be patient.
Stay where you are for about a year.

211
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:57,809
-But there's nothing holding me.
-Trust me.

212
00:18:58,015 --> 00:18:59,365
You know Dr. Gerst?

213
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,345
Michael Glass.

214
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:03,315
It's a pleasure.

215
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:05,918
I saw your review of my book.

216
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:09,821
You didn't understand what I was
saying about the analytic field.

217
00:19:10,027 --> 00:19:14,192
T owards the end you made one or two
interesting remarks.

218
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:17,095
Maybe one of these days
we can discuss it.

219
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:19,834
I'd be honored. Thank you very much.

220
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,235
"One or two interesting remarks"?

221
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:28,675
That was a compliment, Michelle.
Dr. Gerst was very impressed.

222
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:32,249
And it appears that our Michael
has just been knighted.

223
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:34,715
Cheers.

224
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:38,385
Congratulations.

225
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:18,432
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

226
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:24,837
Every day I see you writing and I am
thinking, "What is he writing about?"

227
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,032
Is it a novel?

228
00:20:27,677 --> 00:20:30,043
No, but there was a novelist in it.

229
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:33,443
Really? Who?

230
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,948
I can't tell you that.
Otherwise I'd have to kill you.

231
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,354
Must be someone famous, then.

232
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,032
Excuse me. Dr. Glass?

233
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:02,720
I'm Peter Ristedes.
Adam T owers' assistant.

234
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:05,072
Urbane magazine.

235
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:09,218
Mind if I join you?

236
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,016
Adam asked me to see if you'd give us
a quote for the article he's writing.

237
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:16,205
I believe he mentioned it to you.

238
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:20,522
He didn't seem to think
you'd want to talk to him.

239
00:21:27,573 --> 00:21:30,133
I'll take that as a "no comment," then?

240
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:49,085
Dr. Glass?

241
00:21:51,998 --> 00:21:53,431
Miss Tramell.

242
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:56,510
What are you doing here?

243
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:58,637
I wanted to talk to you.

244
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,636
About the evaluation.

245
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:06,176
Some of the things you said,
I've been thinking about them a lot.

246
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:10,981
I'm sorry you had to hear all that.

247
00:22:14,556 --> 00:22:15,921
Got a minute?

248
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:22,329
Come through.

249
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:36,641
What you said about me
being addicted to risk...

250
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:40,043
...about having to do more and more
dangerous things....

251
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:43,548
Well, after you said it...

252
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:46,487
...I realized I was...

253
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,214
...scared.

254
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:50,988
What exactly scared you?

255
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,699
For weeks before the accident
I was having the same...

256
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,766
...fantasy over and over again.

257
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:05,201
I even wrote about it.

258
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,575
The woman's driving in the car,
the man's making her come.

259
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:14,513
She drives off the road,
the man's killed.

260
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:18,289
I feel like maybe I made it all happen.

261
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,990
That's why I'm here.

262
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,095
Are you saying you'd like to
go into treatment?

263
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,091
Yeah.

264
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:31,701
Well, I think that's a very good idea.

265
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,168
I wouldn't be able to treat you, but I'd
be happy to refer you to a colleague.

266
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,844
Why can't you treat me?

267
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:42,354
It's not advisable for a doctor who's
done a forensic evaluation...

268
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:44,684
...to then become that person's
therapist.

269
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:45,651
Why not?

270
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:50,289
Therapy requires a great deal of trust,
which is difficult for most people.

271
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,220
It's best to start with a clean slate.

272
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:55,918
You mean you don't trust me.

273
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,700
What I said about you at the hearing
must have seemed very negative.

274
00:24:02,904 --> 00:24:05,199
I'm sure you've got feelings about that.

275
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:07,726
I'd be happy referring you
to another doctor.

276
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:11,604
This is Dr. Milena Gardosh.
She has a clinic here in London.

277
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:13,610
You want to know the truth?

278
00:24:13,815 --> 00:24:18,515
The reason I agreed to the evaluation
was because I thought it would be fun.

279
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,051
I never....

280
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:24,584
I never talked to anyone who....

281
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:41,968
My patient's here.

282
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:49,923
What do I owe you?

283
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:52,045
You don't owe me anything.

284
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:57,159
But if you'd like to call Dr. Gardosh,
I'm sure she can help you.

285
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,352
I don't shop around.

286
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:02,726
Like you said,
trust is very hard to come by.

287
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:07,700
I was hoping I might find it with you.

288
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,177
Listen, why don't we
schedule another meeting.

289
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,941
And then we can talk about this
when we're not so rushed.

290
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:07,935
You look different today. More relaxed.

291
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:12,602
The more nervous I am,
the more relaxed people think I am.

292
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:17,304
I wanted to talk about something you
brought up last Wednesday.

293
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:19,314
You said before the accident...

294
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:23,251
...you had fantasies of sexual
excitement and driving off the road.

295
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:26,110
Do you often have fantasies like that?

296
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:28,187
I have fantasies all the time.

297
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:33,091
Fantasies involving violence, death?

298
00:26:34,697 --> 00:26:36,272
People die in my novels.

299
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:39,525
I have to think of new and interesting
ways to kill them.

300
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:43,996
What happens when
you don't take risks?

301
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:55,516
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in here.
It's a rule.

302
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:57,187
I don't like rules.

303
00:26:57,388 --> 00:26:59,863
I have some of them,
and that's one of them.

304
00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:06,792
After the hearing...

305
00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:11,025
...I was interviewed by a reporter
from Urbane magazine.

306
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:18,135
Adam T owers. He said he knew you.

307
00:27:18,343 --> 00:27:20,140
Slightly. Why?

308
00:27:22,114 --> 00:27:25,174
He told me about the Cheslav case.

309
00:27:25,384 --> 00:27:28,251
I was impressed by what you did.

310
00:27:28,453 --> 00:27:31,752
You knew Cheslav was dangerous.

311
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:34,188
Still you protected him.

312
00:27:35,395 --> 00:27:37,863
You honored his confidentiality...

313
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:41,061
...even at risk to yourself.

314
00:27:42,568 --> 00:27:45,401
Do you think you made the right
decision?

315
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:47,698
Or do you think you fucked up?

316
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:53,577
Given what I knew at the time,
I made the right decision.

317
00:27:55,983 --> 00:28:00,079
So you still believe in confidentiality.

318
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:03,957
Within legal limits.
What exactly are you concerned with?

319
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,997
If I told you
that I killed Kevin Franks...

320
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:17,899
...would you report me to the police?

321
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:22,140
No.

322
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:26,644
Anything that happened in the past,
I wouldn't discuss outside this room.

323
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:33,082
But if you told me you were going to
murder someone specifically...

324
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:35,553
...and I thought you were serious...

325
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:38,192
...then, yes, I'd go to the police.

326
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:43,559
I might be manipulating you
to create risk for myself.

327
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:49,968
Do you want to talk about
what happened to Kevin?

328
00:28:54,277 --> 00:28:55,938
No, not really.

329
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:59,013
I was just checking your policy.

330
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:03,044
So have you decided?

331
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:07,250
About taking me on as a patient.

332
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:14,926
Shooter had an ex-wife,
a drinking problem...

333
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:19,092
...a drug problem, a complicated sex
problem he was barely aware of.

334
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:22,205
And a tremendous amount of
free-floating rage.

335
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:26,400
In short, he was a cop
and a very good one.

336
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:27,827
On March 3rd....

337
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:30,438
The woman knelt naked
at the foot of the bed.

338
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:32,879
Her back to him, her head on a pillow.

339
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:37,420
Shooter raked his fingers through her
blond hair and twisted it tight.

340
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:39,717
She groaned, her breath catching...

341
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:44,124
... as he suddenly yanked her hair like
a rider pulling on a horse 's mane.

342
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,994
The veins on his arms bulged as
he roughly drew her onto him.

343
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:53,765
Do you remember
that cop Washburn?

344
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,374
T o him, the fact that I wasn't upset
about Kevin Franks...

345
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,310
...was proof that I must've killed him.

346
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:07,178
Then, when I wouldn't break down...

347
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,447
...he hit on me.

348
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:12,655
Hit on you?

349
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,919
Yeah.

350
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:17,530
He said that if I fucked him things
would go easier.

351
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:21,668
Homicide cops
are usually smarter than that.

352
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:27,073
I knew one once, in San Francisco.

353
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,677
Nick Curran.

354
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,905
They called him Shooter.

355
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:36,414
We used to get in his car
and ride around...

356
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:39,816
...listening to 911 calls on his
scanner...

357
00:30:40,022 --> 00:30:41,785
...then speed over.

358
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:45,552
Have you ever been to a murder scene
right after it happened?

359
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,966
The body's still warm.

360
00:30:53,303 --> 00:30:55,771
The watch is still ticking.

361
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,965
You can smell the blood.

362
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:03,642
We'd hang around
for a while and then...

363
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:06,338
...go have sex in Nick's car.

364
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:13,456
Nick used to say:

365
00:31:13,658 --> 00:31:19,119
"Death is always there.
It's the only thing that's real."

366
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,493
Except maybe sex sometimes.

367
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,295
But only sometimes?

368
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:27,301
Well...

369
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,837
...I fucked this guy last night.

370
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:33,204
I fucked him for hours.

371
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:36,142
You know,
we did everything to each other.

372
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:42,751
The full screaming Masters
and Johnson's greatest hits.

373
00:31:43,223 --> 00:31:48,718
But you know, a week from now,
I probably won't even remember him.

374
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:52,763
But, if I was with him when he died....

375
00:31:55,368 --> 00:31:56,596
Now...

376
00:31:57,938 --> 00:32:02,899
...I probably would never forget that.

377
00:32:04,946 --> 00:32:06,140
Would I?

378
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:10,476
Were you ever with anyone
when they died?

379
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:15,914
No.

380
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:19,293
Christ.

381
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:26,400
We still have 20 minutes left.

382
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:28,728
I feel like a cigarette.

383
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:30,632
See you tomorrow.

384
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,135
She just walked out?

385
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,303
How Lacanian.

386
00:32:36,512 --> 00:32:38,309
For her, time's a weapon.

387
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:41,506
Everything's a weapon.
Everybody's an enemy.

388
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:46,679
Do you think she made it up about
the policeman? Washburn?

389
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:50,450
I don't know. It's so hard to believe
anything she says.

390
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,423
She's trying to seduce you.

391
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:54,654
They always try to seduce you.

392
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:57,527
Yes, but this one's different, isn't it?

393
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:01,700
I don't know. More fun maybe.

394
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:03,896
Be careful, Michael.

395
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:10,271
By the way, I got a call from that
reporter, Adam T owers.

396
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:12,909
What did he want?

397
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:16,647
I made everything sound boring.
I assured him he didn't have a story.

398
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:19,551
What if he calls others?
What if he calls Gerst?

399
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:23,854
Gerst won't talk to a popular magazine
reporter. Are you kidding?

400
00:33:39,011 --> 00:33:41,036
Anyway, it was a successful paper.

401
00:33:41,213 --> 00:33:44,003
Published, on this occasion,
under sole authorship.

402
00:33:44,116 --> 00:33:45,777
Well, thank God for that.

403
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:48,113
Speaking of God, is Gerst coming?

404
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:50,289
We can only hope and pray.

405
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,651
That he comes or he doesn't?

406
00:33:54,094 --> 00:33:58,656
I'm going for a smoke. Don't talk about
anything interesting till I get back.

407
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,933
How long have you lived here?

408
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:05,531
About six years, something like that.
Seven.

409
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:16,852
Hi, Dominic.

410
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:18,178
Hi, Milena.

411
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:27,395
Thank you.

412
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:32,716
The beauty about
antisocial behavior...

413
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:36,362
...is that it takes you away from other
people, however briefly.

414
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,169
You're not an analyst.

415
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:43,977
I'm a writer.

416
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,614
Really? What do you write about?

417
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:50,843
Oh, the lurid, the sexual, the violent.

418
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:52,749
The basic instincts.

419
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:56,073
They're the most powerful,
aren't they?

420
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,300
Milena.

421
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,804
Oh, Michael.

422
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,442
I'm sorry, I didn't ask your name.

423
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,808
Catherine Tramell. Milena Gardosh.

424
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:20,408
Oh, you're Dr. Gardosh.

425
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,645
I've heard so many wonderful things
about you.

426
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,186
Catherine.

427
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,756
There you are.

428
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,259
Milena, Dr. Glass.
I see you've met Catherine.

429
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:38,927
She's doing research for a novel about
an eminent psychoanalyst.

430
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:42,107
I thought she might enjoy an occasion
like this.

431
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,675
Well, may I take your coats?

432
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,910
Thank you.

433
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:51,413
Excuse me.

434
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:56,254
Would you put that in my pocket?

435
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:58,992
Certainly.

436
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:03,294
Catherine, come this way.

437
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:08,691
What's going on? What was Gerst
thinking of, bringing her here?

438
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:11,303
I'm sure he's no idea who she is.

439
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,235
Where did he meet her?

440
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:15,705
She would have met him, believe me.

441
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:20,373
I can't stay here while I've got
a patient here. I have to go.

442
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:21,810
I understand.

443
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:27,310
If you follow inter-subjectivity to its
natural end...

444
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:30,684
...aren't you asking who's the patient
and who's the doctor?

445
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:32,724
Those were my very words.

446
00:36:32,928 --> 00:36:34,225
Very good.

447
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:37,855
Note that one for future reference.

448
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:49,472
Are you leaving because of me?

449
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,884
You must have known I'd be here.

450
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:56,882
Is that a problem?

451
00:36:57,087 --> 00:37:00,284
I know some people who play tennis
with their shrinks.

452
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,889
I'm sure you do.

453
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:06,154
Have sex with them. Sell them drugs.
Work on their screenplays.

454
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:07,922
But I don't do that.

455
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:12,897
I was upset about our session today.

456
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:16,073
I felt I owed you an apology.

457
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,465
That's why I came.

458
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:22,205
We can go into that tomorrow.

459
00:37:22,714 --> 00:37:24,682
I've got a better idea.

460
00:37:24,883 --> 00:37:28,944
How about I ditch everybody
and we go somewhere for a drink.

461
00:37:29,388 --> 00:37:33,017
I told you, I don't socialize with my
patients.

462
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,790
Another one of your rules?

463
00:37:35,994 --> 00:37:38,360
Don't you get kind of tired of them?

464
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:41,931
You know, that's the nightmare
of shrinkdom, doctor.

465
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,763
T oo many answers,
too many questions...

466
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,461
...nobody gets laid.

467
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:54,676
Okay, forget getting laid.

468
00:37:56,884 --> 00:37:58,351
We'll just talk.

469
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,688
We'll talk tomorrow.

470
00:38:20,575 --> 00:38:23,169
Michael. There you are.

471
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:27,781
Oh, my God. Did you see that woman
that Gerst brought with him?

472
00:38:27,982 --> 00:38:29,244
No.

473
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:32,113
Actually, I was just looking for you.

474
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:34,559
What, in there?

475
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:37,960
I was looking for your coat.
I thought we could go for a drink.

476
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,355
If that's all right?

477
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:43,828
Yeah. Great.

478
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:26,871
What's wrong?

479
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,273
Turn around.

480
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,447
What?

481
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:30,945
Turn around.

482
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,054
Oh, God!

483
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:19,359
Michael, it's Denise!
Please pick up the phone! Please!

484
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:22,002
Michael, please pick up the phone!

485
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:23,637
Denise?

486
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:26,335
Hey, hey, hey. What's happened?

487
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:43,254
Thanks, guv.

488
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,521
Come in, Michael.

489
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:51,324
Hey, you okay?

490
00:40:53,936 --> 00:40:55,734
Hey, what's going on?

491
00:40:55,939 --> 00:40:58,407
It's okay, I'm here now. Okay?

492
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:00,042
Who lives here?

493
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:02,041
It's Adam's place.

494
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:40,245
Jesus.

495
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:42,514
What happened?

496
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:47,385
I don't know. The door was unlocked
and I just came in.

497
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:49,562
I just saw him lying there.

498
00:41:52,032 --> 00:41:53,966
Have you called the police?

499
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:56,067
No. I was afraid.

500
00:42:44,787 --> 00:42:46,584
Hello, Michael.

501
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:48,654
What are you doing here?

502
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,122
It's my wife. Well, my ex-wife.

503
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:54,057
She found him like that,
then she called me.

504
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:01,699
I see.

505
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:05,932
And how did she happen to
find him like that?

506
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:09,707
They'd been seeing each other and....

507
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:13,549
Oh, really?

508
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:15,309
Since when?

509
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,484
It's why I moved out.

510
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:23,688
So I assume you weren't
the best of friends?

511
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:24,953
No.

512
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:30,425
Yet I saw you talking to him
after the Tramell hearing.

513
00:43:30,635 --> 00:43:32,435
It was just journalist stuff.

514
00:43:32,504 --> 00:43:35,337
He was asking me questions about
Tramell.

515
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:37,406
Do you think she killed him?

516
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:40,103
Who?

517
00:43:43,315 --> 00:43:45,078
Denise? No.

518
00:43:45,284 --> 00:43:47,411
No, not a chance.

519
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,265
I've known her for a long time.
She could never do anything like that.

520
00:43:53,226 --> 00:43:57,287
Listen, Roy, I've told my story twice
over. Is it all right if I go home?

521
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:00,091
All right.

522
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:04,159
Oh, by the way...

523
00:44:07,007 --> 00:44:08,167
...this yours?

524
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:14,715
No, I just found it on the floor.

525
00:44:16,184 --> 00:44:18,516
How did it end up in the rubbish?

526
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:23,186
I stepped on it. It was leaking.
I just threw it away.

527
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:28,128
Can I go?

528
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:33,530
Yes, by all means.

529
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:40,332
I assume you know Adam T owers
was killed.

530
00:45:41,774 --> 00:45:43,435
Why would I know?

531
00:45:43,843 --> 00:45:46,368
Because of Denise.

532
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:47,876
Denise?

533
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,655
Your wife. Your ex-wife.

534
00:45:49,782 --> 00:45:52,182
I know who she is.
How do you know her?

535
00:45:52,718 --> 00:45:55,915
Adam introduced us a couple of times.

536
00:45:56,122 --> 00:46:00,150
It was all very open. I knew about her,
she knew about me.

537
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,827
Knew what about you?

538
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:07,160
That I was seeing him too.

539
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:10,895
The Masters and Johnson guy.
That was him.

540
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:14,198
So-- You were sleeping
with Adam T owers?

541
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:16,573
Occasionally.

542
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:22,389
So, of course,
Washburn thinks I killed him.

543
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,125
Why would he think that?

544
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:30,480
I kill because I'm addicted to risk.
Or to prove that I exist.

545
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:32,360
I'm not sure which one it is.

546
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,329
I never said you killed anybody.

547
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,925
But you think I did.

548
00:46:35,998 --> 00:46:40,799
You think I killed Kevin, and now
you're wondering if I killed Adam.

549
00:46:41,003 --> 00:46:44,700
Why don't you just ask me?
Or is that too direct for you?

550
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:48,699
Did you kill him?

551
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:52,978
If I said I didn't,
would you believe me?

552
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,609
Depends.

553
00:46:58,088 --> 00:47:01,854
On what?
The quality of my performance?

554
00:47:02,058 --> 00:47:05,858
You know what?
I'm glad Adam T owers is dead.

555
00:47:06,062 --> 00:47:07,772
And you should be glad too.

556
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:10,730
If you're too uptight,
I'll be glad for you.

557
00:47:10,935 --> 00:47:13,062
Whoever killed him did you a favor.

558
00:47:13,271 --> 00:47:14,431
Favor?

559
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:18,971
If he'd written that article on Cheslav,
it would've ruined your career.

560
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,605
You haven't told me if you killed him.
Can you put that out?

561
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:28,485
Put it out now or you can leave,
okay?!

562
00:47:35,761 --> 00:47:37,092
Is that better?

563
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:20,004
When you think about fucking me...

564
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:22,608
...and I know you do...

565
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:26,474
...how do you picture it, doctor?

566
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:33,248
Oh, I know you can't answer me,
so just think it.

567
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:36,220
Do you want it straight up?

568
00:48:36,424 --> 00:48:37,891
You on top?

569
00:48:38,093 --> 00:48:39,527
Me on top?

570
00:48:41,297 --> 00:48:44,061
Do you want it from behind...

571
00:48:46,936 --> 00:48:50,804
...on your knees,
my face in the pillow?

572
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:54,906
Do you want to beat me up...

573
00:48:55,444 --> 00:48:57,640
...just a little?

574
00:48:57,848 --> 00:48:59,816
Not too hard.

575
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:04,486
Oh, a little harder than that.

576
00:49:07,657 --> 00:49:10,319
Do you want to come in my mouth?

577
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:18,364
What if I told you that I masturbate
thinking about you?

578
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:21,864
That I make myself come...

579
00:49:22,073 --> 00:49:26,203
...thinking about you
making yourself come.

580
00:49:36,755 --> 00:49:39,155
I guess we're out of time for today.

581
00:49:49,835 --> 00:49:51,770
I'm terminating therapy.

582
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:53,529
Send me the bill.

583
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:40,385
Are you feeling all right?

584
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:11,678
Miss Tramell, it's Dr. Glass here.

585
00:51:12,256 --> 00:51:15,453
Listen, I'm concerned about how our
session ended today.

586
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:18,359
I'd like to talk through
any misunderstandings...

587
00:51:18,562 --> 00:51:20,588
...there might be between us.

588
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:23,892
As soon as you get this message,
please give me a--

589
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:27,431
Just call me when you can.

590
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:29,470
Evening, Dr. Glass.

591
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:32,100
Could I have a word?

592
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,278
Sure. Upstairs.

593
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:40,846
Is that German?

594
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:42,583
Can I get you anything?

595
00:51:42,721 --> 00:51:43,915
No.

596
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:46,057
So here's a surprise.

597
00:51:46,258 --> 00:51:50,627
Adam Towers had a girlfriend
besides Denise.

598
00:51:50,829 --> 00:51:52,126
Guess who.

599
00:51:53,566 --> 00:51:55,296
Catherine Tramell.

600
00:51:56,736 --> 00:51:58,271
You don't look surprised.

601
00:51:58,271 --> 00:52:00,206
She's a private patient of mine.

602
00:52:00,407 --> 00:52:01,874
I see. Since when?

603
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:03,133
Not long.

604
00:52:04,377 --> 00:52:09,076
So your ex and your private patient
were both screwing Adam T owers.

605
00:52:09,282 --> 00:52:12,410
That's quite a coincidence.
Did they know each other?

606
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,145
I don't know. I don't think so.
Did you--?

607
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:22,924
Tramell's prints were all over T owers'
apartment, along with others.

608
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:27,294
But what's interesting is the last call
he made was to her mobile phone...

609
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:29,594
...90 minutes before he died.

610
00:52:29,804 --> 00:52:32,307
Her story is she was out walking all
that time.

611
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:36,107
Two hours strolling around Clerkenwell
and nobody saw her, so....

612
00:52:36,311 --> 00:52:39,280
Come on, Michael. Talk to me.

613
00:52:40,349 --> 00:52:44,217
I can't tell you anything. Even if I
knew something, which I don't.

614
00:52:45,754 --> 00:52:49,782
Franks was first. Towers second.
There's bound to be a third.

615
00:52:49,993 --> 00:52:51,961
This goes beyond confidentiality.

616
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:55,522
You've got a legal obligation to protect
a potential victim.

617
00:52:55,732 --> 00:52:59,725
You can't lock somebody up because
you think they might do something.

618
00:52:59,936 --> 00:53:03,337
Why don't you tell me what you know
about this article...

619
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:07,049
...T owers was writing about you
and our old friend George Cheslav.

620
00:53:09,413 --> 00:53:11,663
Who told you
he was writing an article?

621
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:13,143
His editor.

622
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,410
He'd been very busy.
He had a lot of information on you.

623
00:53:18,222 --> 00:53:20,124
What, and you think I killed him...

624
00:53:20,124 --> 00:53:22,554
...to stop him writing
some stupid article?

625
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:28,465
No. But just for the record, why don't
you tell me how you spent last night.

626
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:31,568
Between, say,
7 p.m. and 2 in the morning.

627
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,261
You know, broad strokes.

628
00:53:36,808 --> 00:53:39,174
I had patients until 8 p.m.

629
00:53:39,377 --> 00:53:41,681
Then went to a party
in Collingham Gardens.

630
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:43,616
I left there about 11 with a woman.

631
00:53:43,616 --> 00:53:47,382
We came here and I was on my knees
fucking her when Denise called.

632
00:53:51,724 --> 00:53:53,453
On your knees, eh?

633
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,720
Sounds like your evening
was better than mine.

634
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:02,027
Could I get her name?
So there are no loose ends.

635
00:54:04,304 --> 00:54:08,035
Look, Michael, Adam Towers
was fucking your ex-wife...

636
00:54:08,241 --> 00:54:12,575
...and about to do the same
to your career. I've got to ask.

637
00:54:17,418 --> 00:54:18,976
Michelle Broadwin.

638
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:25,015
She's a psycho-pharmacologist at
Victoria Psychiatric Hospital.

639
00:54:28,363 --> 00:54:29,455
Thank you.

640
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,323
I'll be in touch.

641
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:39,902
What does that mean?

642
00:54:43,512 --> 00:54:45,104
I smell blood.

643
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:05,191
Yeah, not all of them, of course, but,
you know, some of them.

644
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:09,270
They're all so sanctimonious...

645
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,600
...so judgmental.

646
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:17,304
All my friends, they drink too much.
They snort too much coke.

647
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,949
Miss Tramell,
it's Dr. Glass here again.

648
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:22,915
I'm a little concerned
I haven't heard from you.

649
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,452
I was wondering whether you're okay.

650
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:29,684
Look, let me give you
my home number. It's 0207....

651
00:55:29,895 --> 00:55:34,127
Sorry, it really got to me and I don't
know why it seems to be doing that.

652
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:38,530
Why it's getting worse.
I mean, I was really excited.

653
00:55:38,737 --> 00:55:41,706
You have no new messages.

654
00:56:09,002 --> 00:56:10,902
The thing about Gerst is this:

655
00:56:11,104 --> 00:56:13,902
The selection committee
is just a formality.

656
00:56:14,107 --> 00:56:16,041
This is the real interview.

657
00:56:17,778 --> 00:56:19,541
Relax.

658
00:56:19,746 --> 00:56:22,716
Be direct, candid.

659
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:25,351
But not too candid.

660
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:31,357
Very good time. They always get lost
on the way. Come in.

661
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:33,390
Meet my new Mughal painting.

662
00:56:33,595 --> 00:56:35,358
Not another one.

663
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:39,761
An Indian goddess at peace. It has a
tranquility to it, don't you think?

664
00:56:40,402 --> 00:56:44,304
I wonder what the males are doing,
loitering so close to her?

665
00:56:44,507 --> 00:56:47,999
It's obvious. They're worshiping her.

666
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,404
As they should.

667
00:56:49,812 --> 00:56:53,339
Perhaps that's why she has eight arms
to fend them off.

668
00:56:53,549 --> 00:56:57,884
Why don't you girls go outside
while Dr. Glass and I have our chat.

669
00:56:59,322 --> 00:57:01,552
Come. Come.

670
00:57:02,158 --> 00:57:05,127
Come with me. You'll enjoy it.

671
00:57:09,533 --> 00:57:12,559
So, Dr. Glass, I have a question:

672
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:14,732
Do you think I'm insane?

673
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:17,474
Pardon?

674
00:57:18,042 --> 00:57:20,203
Nuts? Bonkers? Off my trolley?

675
00:57:21,012 --> 00:57:22,707
No, not at all.

676
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:26,546
But I might be if I recommended you
for the Douglas Chair.

677
00:57:28,986 --> 00:57:30,831
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

678
00:57:30,955 --> 00:57:32,889
George Cheslav.

679
00:57:33,525 --> 00:57:38,622
A major drug dealer, under your care,
brutally murders his girlfriend.

680
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,991
An inquiry is held...

681
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:44,930
...where Detective Roy Washburn...

682
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:48,470
...testifies that you acted
professionally at all times.

683
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:49,875
You're blameless.

684
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:51,270
That's right, I was.

685
00:57:51,945 --> 00:57:55,676
However, after the trial...

686
00:57:55,882 --> 00:57:59,648
...you experienced what we might term
an emotional meltdown:

687
00:57:59,886 --> 00:58:01,148
Depression...

688
00:58:01,354 --> 00:58:03,515
...occupational underachievement...

689
00:58:03,723 --> 00:58:05,384
...marital problems...

690
00:58:05,592 --> 00:58:09,028
...and questionable professional
conduct...

691
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:13,131
...much discussed at dinner parties
around our great city.

692
00:58:15,536 --> 00:58:16,594
I'm sorry?

693
00:58:17,905 --> 00:58:20,669
Now you want my support
for the Douglas Chair.

694
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:27,977
No more Cheslavs, Michael.

695
00:58:30,952 --> 00:58:32,112
No.

696
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,123
No more Cheslavs.

697
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:31,860
Catherine!

698
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,206
Sorry. All right.
Sorry, I'm just looking for someone.

699
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:56,580
God, Michael, how dramatic.

700
01:01:56,786 --> 01:01:57,753
I know.

701
01:01:57,953 --> 01:02:01,720
I thought she was in danger,
but I know that's not the point.

702
01:02:01,925 --> 01:02:04,085
She could be a murderer twice over...

703
01:02:04,194 --> 01:02:07,755
...and you're acting like she's a
princess you have to rescue.

704
01:02:07,998 --> 01:02:10,228
Don't patronize me, please.

705
01:02:12,002 --> 01:02:13,993
It's driving me crazy.

706
01:02:16,273 --> 01:02:18,537
You're in love with her, aren't you?

707
01:02:20,078 --> 01:02:21,943
Not love. It's....

708
01:02:24,182 --> 01:02:25,615
I don't know.

709
01:02:30,221 --> 01:02:33,384
You have to terminate this therapy,
right away.

1
01:02:35,453 --> 01:02:38,616
Well, it's already done.
She terminated it herself.

2
01:02:38,823 --> 01:02:39,790
Good.

3
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:43,918
If she calls again, give her my number.

4
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,089
I'm a woman.

5
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,133
She'll relate to me differently.

6
01:03:36,343 --> 01:03:38,311
What are you doing here?

7
01:03:38,512 --> 01:03:40,707
Where she goes, I go.

8
01:03:40,914 --> 01:03:42,074
Since when?

9
01:03:42,282 --> 01:03:45,911
Since she started coming
to your office five days a week.

10
01:03:48,655 --> 01:03:53,489
So, Adam T owers.
Seems his research has gone missing.

11
01:03:53,693 --> 01:03:56,685
All his notebooks, audiotapes,
even his hard drive.

12
01:03:56,896 --> 01:03:59,626
Everything on George Cheslav
and Michael Glass.

13
01:03:59,832 --> 01:04:02,426
-You think Catherine has it?
-I know she does.

14
01:04:02,635 --> 01:04:06,036
She ever tell you about them
when she's chatting on the couch?

15
01:04:06,238 --> 01:04:07,672
You know I can't discuss that.

16
01:04:07,672 --> 01:04:10,937
Come on. I've been very good to you
these past few years.

17
01:04:11,142 --> 01:04:13,940
I'm practically a psychopath
delivery service.

18
01:04:14,145 --> 01:04:15,720
I can't break privilege.

19
01:04:15,914 --> 01:04:19,247
Pity. I have something
you might like to know about.

20
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:22,887
Someone says you'd been lying
at the Cheslav inquest.

21
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:24,554
Who?

22
01:04:24,755 --> 01:04:27,349
You want me to break privilege?

23
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:32,250
Since you're a friend,
it was your ex-wife.

24
01:04:32,463 --> 01:04:33,987
Denise?

25
01:04:34,198 --> 01:04:35,995
You want to sort her out.

26
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,159
Who knows, she might tell you
where T owers' notes went.

27
01:05:02,491 --> 01:05:06,825
Someone's here.
Do you want us to say?

28
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:09,429
I'll be all right. Don't worry.

29
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,189
We'll see you later.

30
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,662
How you doing?

31
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,531
Okay.

32
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:21,636
Do you want a drink?

33
01:05:21,742 --> 01:05:24,006
No, I have to go.

34
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:26,907
I'm meeting someone
at the Atlantic Bar.

35
01:05:28,015 --> 01:05:32,884
Denise, did you tell T owers that
I lied at the Cheslav inquiry?

36
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,414
Of course, there's always an agenda.

37
01:05:37,624 --> 01:05:41,560
No. I said you knew he was going
to kill his girlfriend.

38
01:05:41,761 --> 01:05:43,229
I didn't. That's a lie.

39
01:05:43,229 --> 01:05:44,457
Yes, you did.

40
01:05:44,664 --> 01:05:49,192
You kept saying how you knew
and should have gone to the police.

41
01:05:49,402 --> 01:05:53,997
I didn't know. I sensed. And I told you
that as my wife in confidence.

42
01:05:54,206 --> 01:05:58,199
I didn't think you'd go and repeat it
in bed to some moron reporter.

43
01:06:00,646 --> 01:06:04,291
Do you want to ruin my life, is that it?
You want to ruin my practice?

44
01:06:05,551 --> 01:06:08,951
Your life? Your practice?

45
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:12,452
Catherine was right,
everything's always about you.

46
01:06:12,657 --> 01:06:15,751
What about me? Adam's dead
and I'm a murder suspect.

47
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,420
Washburn keeps going on about me
not cooperating, like I'm a liar.

48
01:06:20,631 --> 01:06:22,746
I don't know where Adam's notes are.

49
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,369
I'm scared to go home. I'm scared
to go out. I'm going out of my mind.

50
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:27,871
Be careful about Catherine.

51
01:06:27,871 --> 01:06:29,439
Don't tell me what to do!

52
01:06:29,439 --> 01:06:30,607
Just calm down.

53
01:06:30,607 --> 01:06:32,677
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

54
01:06:32,843 --> 01:06:33,923
Hey, come on.

55
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:37,138
That's my wife, okay?
This is a private conversation.

56
01:06:37,347 --> 01:06:39,372
Get out of my way! Out of my way!

57
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,924
Denise. Oh, Denise!

58
01:08:47,135 --> 01:08:48,432
Come on.

59
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:51,529
Come on, come on.

60
01:08:58,547 --> 01:09:01,175
Come on, Denise. Look at me.

61
01:09:02,384 --> 01:09:03,816
Call an ambulance!

62
01:09:04,318 --> 01:09:05,945
Do it now!

63
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:08,922
Come on. Let's go.

64
01:09:10,324 --> 01:09:13,487
Stay with me. Come on. Stay with me.

65
01:09:14,795 --> 01:09:16,660
Come on. Stay with me.

66
01:09:49,662 --> 01:09:51,926
You have a problem, Michael.

67
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:57,565
Witnesses say they saw you arguing.
She was crying.

68
01:09:57,769 --> 01:10:00,795
You grabbed her.
She almost fell down.

69
01:10:01,005 --> 01:10:04,566
Five minutes later,
somebody slits her throat.

70
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:10,404
Also, there are people here who think
you killed Towers.

71
01:10:10,615 --> 01:10:13,981
Towers? Didn't you speak to Michelle?

72
01:10:14,184 --> 01:10:18,144
Yes. But now I'm hearing about this
cigarette lighter with your prints on it.

73
01:10:18,155 --> 01:10:19,456
I just picked that up.

74
01:10:19,456 --> 01:10:24,291
And your ex is in a coma just as she's
to say something inconvenient for you.

75
01:10:24,494 --> 01:10:26,462
I was trying to save her life.

76
01:10:30,866 --> 01:10:34,802
Look, I spoke to T owers' assistant
at Urbane magazine.

77
01:10:35,004 --> 01:10:38,906
He expected Denise to say that you
perjured yourself at Cheslav's inquiry.

78
01:10:39,108 --> 01:10:40,810
She wasn't going to say that.

79
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:42,607
What was she going to say?

80
01:10:48,783 --> 01:10:50,011
Sorry, guv.

81
01:11:00,028 --> 01:11:01,620
You wait there.

82
01:11:59,183 --> 01:12:00,411
So....

83
01:12:01,952 --> 01:12:07,117
Your ex and Catherine Tramell
were girl buddies. Did you know that?

84
01:12:08,459 --> 01:12:10,484
What do you mean "girl buddies"?

85
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:15,221
According to Catherine,
they met through Towers and hit it off.

86
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:22,008
Denise told Catherine that T owers had
been pressuring her...

87
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:24,903
...into saying that you'd perjured
yourself.

88
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:29,044
But Denise wasn't having it.
She was going to say you were clean.

89
01:12:30,613 --> 01:12:34,078
You didn't know Cheslav was going to
kill his girlfriend, did you?

90
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,906
In fact, it came
as a complete surprise, didn't it?

91
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:44,264
-Of course she's lying.
-How do you know?

92
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:48,557
Everything that comes out of her is a
lie. Even the truth's a lie with her.

93
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:51,999
It's her way of getting you to think
what she wants you to think.

94
01:12:51,999 --> 01:12:54,294
That's her art. The art of mind-fucking.

95
01:12:54,402 --> 01:12:56,292
She might be a talented writer.

96
01:12:56,337 --> 01:12:59,602
When it comes to mind-fucking,
she's the all-time genius.

97
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:05,103
She really got to you, didn't she?

98
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:11,542
What do you mean?
What did she tell you about me?

99
01:13:12,085 --> 01:13:14,645
Well, what is there to tell?

100
01:13:14,855 --> 01:13:18,757
Don't play games with me.
She can pull it off, you can't.

101
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,525
Where are you going?

102
01:13:24,563 --> 01:13:28,522
Someplace else. Unless
you have evidence to charge me.

103
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:31,030
Do you?

104
01:13:33,005 --> 01:13:34,632
I didn't think so.

105
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,471
He let you go, finally.

106
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,202
I was worried.

107
01:14:18,214 --> 01:14:21,411
You lied to Washburn for me. Why?

108
01:14:21,751 --> 01:14:24,481
I knew you hadn't hurt Denise.

109
01:14:24,687 --> 01:14:27,178
How could you know that?

110
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:30,325
Because I know you.

111
01:14:30,526 --> 01:14:34,188
And I know the cops were keeping you
just to play some kind of game.

112
01:14:34,396 --> 01:14:36,796
What, like getting me
to talk about you?

113
01:14:36,998 --> 01:14:41,901
Yeah, but you wouldn't do that,
because you're into confidentiality.

114
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:47,131
Why were you meeting with Denise?

115
01:14:47,642 --> 01:14:50,270
Research for my novel.

116
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:52,009
Research.

117
01:14:52,213 --> 01:14:53,339
About what?

118
01:14:53,547 --> 01:14:55,276
About you.

119
01:14:55,482 --> 01:14:58,451
And Cheslav, the masked psychotic.

120
01:15:01,488 --> 01:15:05,015
The analyst in my book is obsessed
with that sort of thing.

121
01:15:07,027 --> 01:15:09,995
Washburn thinks
that you slit Denise's throat.

122
01:15:11,631 --> 01:15:15,089
Me? You're the one that hated her.

123
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:18,327
Maybe I'm acting out
your unconscious impulses.

124
01:15:18,605 --> 01:15:19,867
Stop it!

125
01:15:22,942 --> 01:15:27,105
Do you think it's possible that
you want me to be the killer?

126
01:15:27,312 --> 01:15:31,681
You know, how some guys
are into blonds...

127
01:15:31,883 --> 01:15:34,249
...and some guys are into killers.

128
01:15:35,887 --> 01:15:37,642
Isn't that what you're into?

129
01:15:40,826 --> 01:15:43,386
Isn't that what turns you on?

130
01:15:45,763 --> 01:15:47,128
Turns me on?

131
01:15:51,769 --> 01:15:54,135
Isn't that why you're over here?

132
01:16:37,178 --> 01:16:38,202
Okay.

133
01:16:39,414 --> 01:16:41,006
I trust you.

134
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:43,817
You trust me.

135
01:18:05,862 --> 01:18:08,262
Is there somewhere we can talk?

136
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:09,897
Over there.

137
01:18:25,213 --> 01:18:26,982
Can I guess where you got it?

138
01:18:26,982 --> 01:18:28,917
Let's find out what it is first.

139
01:18:29,017 --> 01:18:33,579
It would be highly improper of me to
accept any evidence in this fashion.

140
01:18:33,789 --> 01:18:34,983
Fine.

141
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:38,556
It'll take me a few days
to get it analyzed.

142
01:18:38,759 --> 01:18:41,660
You'd have made a good cop, Michael.

143
01:18:41,862 --> 01:18:44,126
You like the smell of blood.

144
01:18:52,673 --> 01:18:54,698
Dr. Glass.

145
01:18:54,909 --> 01:18:56,705
Hold on.

146
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:59,640
I was just thinking about you.

147
01:18:59,846 --> 01:19:03,247
I might have more
psychiatric evaluations for you.

148
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:05,745
That's nice, but I'm busy
at the moment.

149
01:19:06,219 --> 01:19:10,747
Oh, that's a pity.
You were so good with Catherine.

150
01:19:10,957 --> 01:19:14,255
She tells me you're very perceptive.

151
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,860
She's very perceptive herself.

152
01:19:20,299 --> 01:19:25,134
I hope Detective Washburn isn't giving
you cause for...

153
01:19:25,337 --> 01:19:26,599
...concern?

154
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,464
What do you mean?

155
01:19:29,675 --> 01:19:32,268
Well, given his past record.

156
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:36,871
What past record?

157
01:20:39,507 --> 01:20:41,030
I want to talk to you.

158
01:20:41,241 --> 01:20:43,038
Oh, so now you want to talk.

159
01:20:43,243 --> 01:20:47,202
Look, this "Dirtiest Cop in London,"
it doesn't mention him by name.

160
01:20:47,414 --> 01:20:50,941
But this "Detective X,"
is that Roy Washburn?

161
01:20:53,921 --> 01:20:55,548
Is it Washburn?

162
01:20:56,623 --> 01:20:57,953
Excuse me?

163
01:21:01,994 --> 01:21:03,825
Yeah, it's him.

164
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,392
Are you sure?

165
01:21:08,601 --> 01:21:12,697
Adam may have been a sloppy writer,
but he had excellent sources.

166
01:21:12,905 --> 01:21:17,307
What about perjury, intimidation,
falsifying evidence. Is that true?

167
01:21:17,509 --> 01:21:19,344
A policeman fabricating evidence.

168
01:21:19,344 --> 01:21:20,612
But you have proof?

169
01:21:20,612 --> 01:21:23,740
How about Kevin Franks
and the Case of the Killer Orgasm?

170
01:21:23,949 --> 01:21:27,234
When I did Catherine Tramell's
assessment, I read that report.

171
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:30,015
Those syringes found in the car
contained DTC.

172
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:33,383
Yeah, well, who found
the syringes in the car?

173
01:21:33,591 --> 01:21:35,616
But why would Washburn do that?

174
01:21:35,826 --> 01:21:38,362
Adam thought he did it to set up
Catherine Tramell.

175
01:21:38,362 --> 01:21:40,162
Why didn't he write about it?

176
01:21:43,133 --> 01:21:44,794
That's the whole point.

177
01:21:45,836 --> 01:21:47,599
He was going to.

178
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:50,433
Then he got killed.

179
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:17,324
I owe you an apology.
About Roy Washburn. I--

180
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:19,062
I don't like apologies.

181
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:26,862
I also don't like people stealing things
from my apartment.

182
01:22:29,543 --> 01:22:34,003
The insulin? In case you haven't had it
analyzed yet.

183
01:22:35,282 --> 01:22:36,249
Insulin?

184
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:38,350
My friend's diabetic.

185
01:22:38,552 --> 01:22:41,180
Let yourself out, doctor.

186
01:23:36,707 --> 01:23:38,197
Hello, Michael.

187
01:23:41,712 --> 01:23:42,972
What do you want?

188
01:23:42,979 --> 01:23:44,913
I got the lab analysis back.

189
01:23:45,115 --> 01:23:48,642
D-Tubocurarine. Funny that.

190
01:23:50,454 --> 01:23:52,254
You're sure it's not insulin?

191
01:23:52,755 --> 01:23:54,279
Insulin?

192
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:55,616
No.

193
01:23:55,825 --> 01:23:57,884
Can I see the report?

194
01:23:59,628 --> 01:24:04,224
You've got some trust issues there.
You might want to work on that.

195
01:24:13,441 --> 01:24:17,172
This isn't an official
Forensic Services report.

196
01:24:17,378 --> 01:24:22,145
No. Because an unpreserved or
contaminated chain of evidence...

197
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:27,651
...will be deemed inadmissible
in a future trial, Inspector Clouseau.

198
01:24:28,956 --> 01:24:31,476
So do you want to tell me
where you found it?

199
01:24:37,264 --> 01:24:38,629
She's not worth it.

200
01:24:38,832 --> 01:24:41,630
People are dying
and I will have her for it.

201
01:24:41,835 --> 01:24:44,400
If you stand in my way,
I'll have you as well.

202
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:46,538
I can fucking promise you that.

203
01:24:51,444 --> 01:24:54,242
I've got something to show you.
Get in the car.

204
01:24:57,717 --> 01:24:59,014
Get in!

205
01:25:14,733 --> 01:25:17,099
Medical examiner's on his way.

206
01:25:31,315 --> 01:25:32,748
Hello, guv.

207
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:44,118
Were you working that night?

208
01:25:44,327 --> 01:25:46,295
No, I don't know.

209
01:25:47,497 --> 01:25:51,160
Did you see or hear
anything suspicious yesterday?

210
01:25:51,367 --> 01:25:53,027
Not yesterday. No.

211
01:25:53,235 --> 01:25:55,601
-Nothing?
-No.

212
01:25:55,804 --> 01:25:57,506
How long have you worked here?

213
01:25:57,506 --> 01:25:58,905
Four months.

214
01:25:59,107 --> 01:26:00,369
Four months?

215
01:26:01,543 --> 01:26:03,477
Where were you before that?

216
01:26:08,617 --> 01:26:09,584
T ed.

217
01:26:09,785 --> 01:26:10,910
Hi, guv.

218
01:26:11,118 --> 01:26:13,985
--remember I talked to Vice earlier and
they said--

219
01:26:14,188 --> 01:26:15,917
Fergie, give me a minute.

220
01:26:16,123 --> 01:26:17,215
Let's go.

221
01:26:37,978 --> 01:26:39,502
Who is he?

222
01:26:39,713 --> 01:26:44,446
Richard Pepovic.
Known to his friends as Dickie Pep.

223
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:49,352
You know him?

224
01:26:49,555 --> 01:26:50,988
No.

225
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:52,782
Look at this.

226
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:05,968
Now, we'll have to wait for the lab
results, of course...

227
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:10,607
...but what's the betting he's oozing
Tubocurarine?

228
01:27:12,777 --> 01:27:15,678
Now do you want to tell me
who gave you the sample?

229
01:27:21,785 --> 01:27:23,650
You don't know she did it.

230
01:27:24,855 --> 01:27:25,947
No.

231
01:27:27,991 --> 01:27:31,654
But then again, maybe I killed him.

232
01:27:32,696 --> 01:27:34,856
Isn't that what she's gonna tell you?

233
01:27:34,865 --> 01:27:37,160
He had something on me,
so I killed him.

234
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,134
Then I jerked him off
even though he was dead...

235
01:27:40,336 --> 01:27:42,872
...to make it look like
there was come everywhere...

236
01:27:42,872 --> 01:27:44,942
...to make it look like it was her.

237
01:27:47,677 --> 01:27:52,705
Look, Towers was right about me,
I put them away whatever it takes.

238
01:27:52,915 --> 01:27:55,280
So, fine, don't trust me.

239
01:27:55,483 --> 01:27:57,508
You know Catherine better than me.

240
01:27:57,686 --> 01:28:00,155
If you have five seconds
when you're not dizzy...

241
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:03,613
...with the smell of her pussy,
ask yourself: Do you trust her?

242
01:28:05,126 --> 01:28:06,252
Do you?

243
01:28:11,866 --> 01:28:15,767
She's George Cheslav, times three.
We both know it.

244
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:18,265
The question is:
How do we put her away?

245
01:28:18,372 --> 01:28:22,741
If you tell the courts that she's made a
direct threat against someone....

246
01:28:22,943 --> 01:28:24,113
But she hasn't.

247
01:28:24,278 --> 01:28:27,441
If you say she did, and that got her put
on a psych ward...

248
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:30,888
...stopped her from killing again,
wouldn't that be worth it?

249
01:28:31,017 --> 01:28:34,680
Some kind of redemption
for Cheslav at last?

250
01:28:38,324 --> 01:28:41,316
Look, I'm prejudiced.

251
01:28:41,527 --> 01:28:43,859
Don't take my word for it.

252
01:28:45,164 --> 01:28:46,961
T alk to this guy.

253
01:28:51,536 --> 01:28:53,231
Listen to him.

254
01:29:18,996 --> 01:29:21,590
Lieutenant Walker. It's Michael.

255
01:29:21,799 --> 01:29:23,823
Look, thanks for talking to me.

256
01:29:24,034 --> 01:29:27,333
It's just that I did an evaluation
of Miss Tramell....

257
01:29:35,545 --> 01:29:39,776
Darkness had fallen and even before
the buzzer sounded...

258
01:29:39,982 --> 01:29:43,213
...Kelly knew it would be the doctor.

259
01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:46,547
He'd come to accuse her
of more crimes.

260
01:29:46,755 --> 01:29:49,246
They'd fight about that
and then have sex...

261
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:51,949
... and everything would be
all right again.

262
01:29:52,161 --> 01:29:53,781
Except it wouldn 't be...

263
01:29:53,962 --> 01:29:55,953
... if he didn 't trust her.

264
01:30:31,897 --> 01:30:33,057
H i, handsome.

265
01:30:33,466 --> 01:30:34,933
My new novel.

266
01:30:35,134 --> 01:30:37,762
I' m anxious to hear
what you think about it.

267
01:30:39,105 --> 01:30:41,767
I've been speaking
to Lieutenant Phil Walker...

268
01:30:41,974 --> 01:30:44,738
...the San Francisco
Police Department.

269
01:30:44,944 --> 01:30:49,744
Paranoid Phil.
Now there's a blast from the past.

270
01:30:49,948 --> 01:30:54,442
He said you murdered a Johnny Boz
and two detectives in San Francisco.

271
01:30:54,652 --> 01:30:56,916
I was never even charged.

272
01:30:57,122 --> 01:31:00,717
Grand jury said that Nick Curran's
girlfriend did it.

273
01:31:03,128 --> 01:31:07,188
I'm going to take a Jacuzzi.
Care to join me?

274
01:31:13,137 --> 01:31:17,471
All right, all right.
I killed Johnny Boz.

275
01:31:17,674 --> 01:31:18,868
Why?

276
01:31:19,076 --> 01:31:21,271
I didn't like him.

277
01:31:21,478 --> 01:31:23,378
For the money.

278
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:26,173
To see if I could get away with it.

279
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:31,650
To show that death
really isn't very important.

280
01:31:31,854 --> 01:31:33,287
Because I was bored.

281
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:35,980
And you know how I hate being bored.

282
01:31:36,192 --> 01:31:37,989
What about Denise, huh?

283
01:31:38,194 --> 01:31:39,388
Adam T owers?

284
01:31:39,595 --> 01:31:41,824
Adam was insufferable.

285
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:44,123
And you are something special.

286
01:31:45,367 --> 01:31:50,066
Adam was trying to ruin you just
out of spite, and I couldn't bear it.

287
01:31:51,907 --> 01:31:53,636
This is wonderful.

288
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:00,909
Denise.

289
01:32:01,448 --> 01:32:05,145
Denise.... Denise was good in bed.

290
01:32:05,352 --> 01:32:08,844
Denise would have spoiled
everything I'd accomplished...

291
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:11,024
...by killing Adam Towers.

292
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:15,356
God, you can't tell the truth
about anything, can you?

293
01:32:17,497 --> 01:32:20,091
You don't believe me
when I say I did it.

294
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,269
You don't believe me
when I say I didn't do it.

295
01:32:23,469 --> 01:32:26,495
What is the point
of talking to you, anyway?

296
01:32:30,143 --> 01:32:31,872
Oh, come on.

297
01:32:34,313 --> 01:32:37,373
Why don't you take your clothes off
and get in, huh?

298
01:32:49,494 --> 01:32:53,122
This is worse than Cheslav, isn't it?

299
01:32:53,331 --> 01:32:57,028
This time you knew
right from the start what I was.

300
01:32:59,136 --> 01:33:02,469
And you let it happen again,
didn't you?

301
01:33:03,975 --> 01:33:07,433
It's almost like you
killed them yourself.

302
01:33:16,253 --> 01:33:19,120
Who do you think
I'm going to kill next?

303
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:26,189
Come on.

304
01:33:26,395 --> 01:33:29,125
You can figure it out.

305
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:24,536
Kelly met the analyst during her little
stay at Holloway Prison.

306
01:35:25,842 --> 01:35:29,174
His eyes were
a beautiful shade of blue.

307
01:35:29,378 --> 01:35:31,846
Did Kelly trust the doctor?

308
01:35:32,047 --> 01:35:35,244
Did she mean it
when she told him she wanted help?

309
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:37,441
Even she wasn 't sure.

310
01:35:37,652 --> 01:35:40,246
If things went well,
then she meant it.

311
01:35:40,455 --> 01:35:41,922
If not, she didn 't.

312
01:35:42,124 --> 01:35:43,969
That way, she 'd be protected.

313
01:35:44,092 --> 01:35:46,327
She remembered the first time
she met Irena...

314
01:35:46,327 --> 01:35:47,895
... at the party in Bloomsbury.

315
01:35:47,895 --> 01:35:50,197
She felt a deep affinity
for the older woman.

316
01:35:50,197 --> 01:35:53,567
As if the two of them leaning against
the wall, silently smoking....

317
01:35:53,567 --> 01:35:55,669
The next time they saw each other...

318
01:35:55,669 --> 01:35:58,099
... only brought
the two women even closer.

319
01:35:58,205 --> 01:36:00,741
Even as Dr. Green watched them
through the window...

320
01:36:00,741 --> 01:36:02,991
... looking for any sign of conspiracy.

321
01:36:03,176 --> 01:36:06,475
Kelly found herself opening up,
trusting the older woman...

322
01:36:06,679 --> 01:36:08,884
... revealing things about herself....

323
01:36:09,015 --> 01:36:11,415
Yes, Kelly thought. She liked Irena.

324
01:36:11,618 --> 01:36:16,146
She was trustworthy, intelligent,
beautiful, dignified.

325
01:36:16,356 --> 01:36:20,792
It was a pity
Kelly was going to have to kill her.

326
01:36:35,641 --> 01:36:37,505
She dressed carefully.

327
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:41,235
She liked to be well-dressed
when she killed.

328
01:36:41,446 --> 01:36:45,246
Killing Irena and telling Dr. Green
she was planning to do it...

329
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:48,419
... that was the riskiest thing
she could do.

330
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:52,313
Come on, Milena.

331
01:36:56,493 --> 01:36:58,688
Come on, Milena, answer the phone

332
01:37:00,464 --> 01:37:04,696
It's Michael Glass here. Can you call
me as soon as you get this message?

333
01:37:06,136 --> 01:37:08,661
As much as Kelly hated her shrink...

334
01:37:08,872 --> 01:37:11,670
...she also loved him.

335
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:15,742
She took a last glance at herself
in the mirror.

336
01:37:15,945 --> 01:37:20,780
Irena deserved a good death.
And Kelly would give it to her.

337
01:37:20,983 --> 01:37:24,043
Hello, this is Roy Washburn,
please leave a message.

338
01:37:24,253 --> 01:37:27,689
Roy. It's Michael Glass.
Come as soon as you can.

339
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:31,381
23 Highgate Street. Hampstead.

340
01:37:31,593 --> 01:37:35,757
I think Catherine is going to kill
Milena Gardosh.

341
01:37:42,570 --> 01:37:47,734
It was almost midnight by the time
Dr. Green got to Hampstead.

342
01:38:04,024 --> 01:38:05,014
What is it?

343
01:38:05,191 --> 01:38:08,183
Thank God.
Listen, we don't have much time.

344
01:38:08,394 --> 01:38:11,139
You're in danger.
She's going to try and kill you.

345
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:13,423
What? Who's trying to kill me?

346
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:15,027
Catherine.

347
01:38:19,338 --> 01:38:21,862
I thought I could help her
but I was wrong.

348
01:38:22,073 --> 01:38:25,804
I'll try and get her sectioned.
It's the only thing that'll stop her.

349
01:38:27,012 --> 01:38:29,105
I've already spoken to Catherine.

350
01:38:33,218 --> 01:38:35,914
She's very upset. You terrified her.

351
01:38:37,489 --> 01:38:41,618
I terrified her? She's a murderer.
She's already admitted it.

352
01:38:41,825 --> 01:38:44,487
For chrissake,
you had sex with your patient.

353
01:38:44,695 --> 01:38:46,993
You assaulted her.
She nearly drowned.

354
01:38:49,233 --> 01:38:53,260
You've broken the law, not to mention
the ethical canon of our profession.

355
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:54,738
It wasn't like that.

356
01:38:54,738 --> 01:38:56,864
Michael, listen to me, please.

357
01:38:57,073 --> 01:38:58,870
You're not well.

358
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:01,988
You're the one who needs help.

359
01:39:06,449 --> 01:39:08,212
I've spoken to Gerst...

360
01:39:08,418 --> 01:39:13,048
...and he thinks that if you volunteer
for a 28-day observation...

361
01:39:13,256 --> 01:39:16,224
...you might be able to avoid
criminal charges.

362
01:39:17,459 --> 01:39:21,953
However, they will have to
revoke your license.

363
01:39:22,998 --> 01:39:24,056
I'm sorry.

364
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:26,566
She's right.

365
01:39:27,002 --> 01:39:29,562
It's for your own good, Michael.

366
01:39:35,076 --> 01:39:37,738
She asked me
to take over her treatment.

367
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,048
She's my patient now.

368
01:39:43,484 --> 01:39:44,849
Please, don't.

369
01:39:48,689 --> 01:39:51,156
You've no idea what
you're getting into.

370
01:39:52,926 --> 01:39:54,325
T ell her the truth.

371
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:58,363
T ell her the truth.

372
01:40:00,533 --> 01:40:02,513
I'll make you tell her the truth.

373
01:40:07,539 --> 01:40:08,563
God.

374
01:40:10,142 --> 01:40:11,131
Come on.

375
01:40:17,816 --> 01:40:20,182
She's right, you know.

376
01:40:20,386 --> 01:40:23,150
You really do need help.

377
01:40:29,227 --> 01:40:30,285
Bitch.

378
01:40:35,867 --> 01:40:37,596
So, what's this about?

379
01:40:39,837 --> 01:40:41,031
Protection.

380
01:40:41,438 --> 01:40:43,303
Oh, yeah? From who?

381
01:40:46,043 --> 01:40:47,442
Washburn.

382
01:40:51,748 --> 01:40:53,113
Go ahead.

383
01:40:58,021 --> 01:41:01,649
Kelly Lash kills Irena,
Dr. Green's colleague.

384
01:41:01,857 --> 01:41:03,825
No, I read your book.

385
01:41:04,026 --> 01:41:07,689
So you just rushed right over here
to save her?

386
01:41:07,897 --> 01:41:12,163
It's just a story, doctor.
Or maybe I really am omnipotent.

387
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:19,771
Congratulations,
the control freak finally lets go.

388
01:41:19,974 --> 01:41:23,979
This is what you wanted from the start,
wasn't it? T o ruin me, to fuck me up!

389
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:27,205
Feels good, doesn't it?

390
01:41:29,384 --> 01:41:34,878
No more "I should've stopped Cheslav
from killing his girlfriend."

391
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:38,354
No more whining over nothing.

392
01:41:38,726 --> 01:41:41,422
-It wasn't over nothing.
-Yes, it was.

393
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:44,756
Cheslav did not kill his girlfriend.

394
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:47,562
Washburn did.

395
01:41:49,403 --> 01:41:50,631
Washburn?

396
01:41:50,837 --> 01:41:54,830
What do you think Adam Towers was
writing about when he was killed?

397
01:41:55,341 --> 01:41:59,641
You're lying.
You're a lying fucking bitch.

398
01:41:59,846 --> 01:42:03,373
Sure I am,
if it makes it easier for you.

399
01:42:04,951 --> 01:42:08,909
Why? Why would he kill
the girlfriend?

400
01:42:11,356 --> 01:42:13,381
To nail Cheslav.

401
01:42:24,269 --> 01:42:25,826
That's right.

402
01:42:27,238 --> 01:42:29,138
Your seven years of hell.

403
01:42:30,374 --> 01:42:32,171
Your meltdown.

404
01:42:32,376 --> 01:42:34,071
Your divorce.

405
01:42:35,646 --> 01:42:40,447
Just so your good friend Roy
could nail a drug dealer.

406
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:52,755
Don't take it so hard.

407
01:42:52,962 --> 01:42:56,454
Even Oedipus
didn't see his mother coming.

408
01:43:03,906 --> 01:43:06,101
It's Roy Washburn.

409
01:43:07,943 --> 01:43:10,411
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

410
01:43:10,813 --> 01:43:12,075
Fuck off!

411
01:43:12,281 --> 01:43:16,775
Give me the gun! He knows I've got
Towers' notes. He wants me dead.

412
01:43:16,985 --> 01:43:18,918
Open the door!

413
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,588
He's going to kill me
and say you did it.

414
01:43:22,156 --> 01:43:25,717
No. No, this is all fucked up.

415
01:43:25,927 --> 01:43:29,988
You don't know what you're doing.
Give me the gun. He's going to kill me.

416
01:43:30,198 --> 01:43:31,529
You--!

417
01:43:35,535 --> 01:43:37,264
Go ahead, then, baby.

418
01:43:53,319 --> 01:43:56,152
Whatever she told you, she's lying.

419
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:00,658
Kill her!

420
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,385
It's the only chance you've got.

421
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:41,357
Let go of the gun!

422
01:44:41,565 --> 01:44:42,998
Clear the weapon!

423
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,531
-Stay still!
-Get off me!

424
01:44:45,735 --> 01:44:48,329
Stop struggling! Stop struggling!

425
01:44:48,537 --> 01:44:52,564
Stay down! I'm telling you
to stay down. Okay?! Stay down!

426
01:44:53,009 --> 01:44:54,499
Get the cuffs on him.

427
01:44:55,878 --> 01:44:57,813
-Call an ambulance!
-Keep still!

428
01:44:57,847 --> 01:44:59,872
Call an ambulance!

429
01:45:10,859 --> 01:45:12,417
Stay down!

430
01:45:40,887 --> 01:45:43,378
Calm down! Calm down!

431
01:45:43,589 --> 01:45:45,352
Nighttime! Nighttime!

432
01:45:45,558 --> 01:45:47,253
You'll be home soon.

433
01:46:13,918 --> 01:46:15,351
Hello, Michael.

434
01:46:21,325 --> 01:46:23,190
I brought you a present.

435
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:30,198
I know you read an earlier draft.
But you gave me a better ending.

436
01:46:32,168 --> 01:46:33,293
So, thank you.

437
01:46:45,515 --> 01:46:48,074
Would you like me to tell you the plot?

438
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:55,256
It's about an American.

439
01:46:56,492 --> 01:46:57,823
A blond.

440
01:46:58,027 --> 01:46:59,688
A novelist.

441
01:46:59,895 --> 01:47:02,955
People around her just keep dying.

442
01:47:03,165 --> 01:47:04,791
But the question is:

443
01:47:04,999 --> 01:47:06,591
Who's killing them?

444
01:47:08,202 --> 01:47:12,866
Is the beautiful blond novelist
a serial killer?

445
01:47:14,575 --> 01:47:16,873
Or is it the crooked cop?

446
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:19,874
Her analyst isn't sure.

447
01:47:20,248 --> 01:47:23,683
But he goes crazy trying to find out.

448
01:47:24,918 --> 01:47:27,045
But that's just half the story.

449
01:47:27,254 --> 01:47:28,551
There's a twist.

450
01:47:30,724 --> 01:47:35,627
You see, the novelist
never really killed anybody.

451
01:47:35,829 --> 01:47:38,195
And neither did the cop.

452
01:47:38,398 --> 01:47:41,423
The real killer all along...

453
01:47:41,634 --> 01:47:43,397
...was the shrink.

454
01:47:59,284 --> 01:48:02,412
Yeah, from the moment he saw her...

455
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:06,989
...he knew she was the smoke screen
he was looking for.

456
01:48:10,862 --> 01:48:13,695
His best opportunity to get even.

457
01:48:16,633 --> 01:48:17,827
First...

458
01:48:19,036 --> 01:48:23,200
...he'd deal with that scumbag
journalist.

459
01:48:25,309 --> 01:48:29,541
You see, you don't just go around
stealing another man's wife.

460
01:48:32,882 --> 01:48:34,349
It's humiliating.

461
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:44,416
Not that she was a complete innocent.

462
01:48:44,627 --> 01:48:46,492
That weekend slut.

463
01:48:48,698 --> 01:48:53,828
Jesus, how could she
let that sleazebag touch her?

464
01:49:00,008 --> 01:49:01,373
It's hurtful.

465
01:49:03,278 --> 01:49:06,576
And there's some hurts
you don't just get over.

466
01:49:11,752 --> 01:49:13,117
Jealousy.

467
01:49:17,091 --> 01:49:20,322
Jealousy can make us do crazy things.

468
01:49:30,203 --> 01:49:32,262
But getting away with it...

469
01:49:35,975 --> 01:49:38,136
...that was genius.

470
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,939
"Unfit to stand trial. "

471
01:49:44,349 --> 01:49:47,409
No prison for him,
just a happy ending...

472
01:49:47,786 --> 01:49:53,156
...in a quiet, sunlit, peaceful
psychiatric institute.

473
01:50:00,932 --> 01:50:04,891
Of course, that could all be a fiction.

474
01:50:07,471 --> 01:50:10,099
He might really be insane.

475
01:50:43,672 --> 01:50:45,572
Come back soon, baby.

476
01:50:47,977 --> 01:50:49,569
I miss you.
