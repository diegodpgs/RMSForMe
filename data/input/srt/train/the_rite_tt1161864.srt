Yeah, that's right.

1260
01:46:24,284 --> 01:46:28,118
Well, I hope you find your place
in the world one of these fine days.

1261
01:46:28,688 --> 01:46:30,212
- I hope so.
- Now, when you do...

1262
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:33,188
...don't forget to say a few prayers
for an old sinner.

1263
01:46:33,827 --> 01:46:37,388
Throw a couple of Hail Marys this way
if that's not too much trouble.

1264
01:46:37,564 --> 01:46:38,588
That a deal?

1265
01:46:38,999 --> 01:46:41,763
- It's a deal.
- Good.

1266
01:46:44,171 --> 01:46:46,071
You know, the first day
you showed up...

1267
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:49,902
...I thought you were so full of it, I was
tempted to kick you into the street.

1268
01:46:50,077 --> 01:46:53,911
But I didn't because I saw
quite a bit of myself in you.

1269
01:46:55,148 --> 01:46:56,979
Scary, isn't it?

1270
01:46:57,984 --> 01:47:01,545
- Yeah, it sure is.
- Yeah.

1271
01:47:01,955 --> 01:47:06,187
All right, that's it. Thanks for everything.
Safe journey. And one other thing.

1272
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:09,328
Faith becomes you. Stay with it.

1273
01:47:09,496 --> 01:47:13,865
Keep fighting the good fight
with all thy might.

1274
01:47:15,402 --> 01:47:17,131
Cool.

1275
01:47:18,605 --> 01:47:20,129
Get out of here.

1276
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:27,447
Goodbye, Father.
