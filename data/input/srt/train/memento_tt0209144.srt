1
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:34,370
(Cries out)

2
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,832
So where are you?

3
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,001
You're in some motel room.

4
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,703
You just wake up and you're in...

5
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:44,631
...in a motel room. There's the key.

6
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:48,385
It feels like maybe it's the first time
you've been here but...

7
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,054
...perhaps you've been there for a week,...

8
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:53,723
...three months, it's...

9
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,017
It's kind of hard to say, l... l don't know.

10
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,144
It’s just an anonymous room.

11
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:03,066
This guy. He's here already.

12
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,152
Lenny!

13
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,571
It's Leonard.

14
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,410
- Like l told you before.
- Did you? l must have forgot.

15
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,288
l guess I've already told you
about my condition.

16
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,999
Oh, well, only every time l see you.

17
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,678
- My car.
- This is your car.

18
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,221
Oh, you're in a playful mood.

19
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,685
- It's not good to make fun of a handicap.
- Just trying to have a little fun.

20
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:44,858
(starts engine)

21
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,778
- Roll up your window.
- Hm?

22
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:56,035
- It's broken.
- l can get that fixed for you.

23
00:03:57,245 --> 00:04:00,331
- So, where to, Sherlock?
- l got a lead on a place.

24
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:03,668
- What the hell you wanna go there for?
- You know it?

25
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:06,463
Yeah, it's just this fucked up building.
Why do you wanna go there?

26
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,883
Don't remember.

27
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,739
- Looks like somebody's home.
- Ah, that thing's been here for years.

28
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:39,412
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

29
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:42,207
Tracks? What are you, Pocahontas?

30
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:44,876
Come on.

31
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,803
Let's take a look inside.

32
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,614
Teddy.

33
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:18,785
Don't believe his lies.
He is the one. Kill him.

34
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,912
I've finally found him.

35
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:23,206
How long have l been looking?

36
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,459
Find anything?

37
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,878
Didn't think so.

38
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,296
Let's go, huh?

39
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,757
Oh, fuck this.

40
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,468
You're gonna pay for what you did.

41
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,347
Beg forgiveness and then you pay.

42
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:46,020
You don't have a clue, you freak!

43
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:49,941
Beg my wife's forgiveness
before l blow your brains out.

44
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:52,986
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

45
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,447
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

46
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,741
Cos you read it off a fucking picture.

47
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,119
(breathless) You don't know who you are.

48
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:05,749
- I'm Leonard Shelby from San Francisco.
- That's who you were. That's not...

49
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,751
...what you've become.

50
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,129
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny? Come on.

51
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,548
Come on, let's go down to the basement.

52
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:16,634
Let's go down, you and me together.

53
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,804
Then you'll know who you really are.

54
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:25,101
- (Teddy) No!
- (gunshot)

55
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,813
It’s just an anonymous room.

56
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:31,441
There's nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.

57
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,943
Nothing except the Gideon Bible,...

58
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,906
...which l, of course, read religiously.
(laughs) Hm.

59
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:41,993
You know who you are
and you know kind of all about yourself.

60
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:47,957
But just for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.

61
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:53,046
Sammy Jankis had the same problem
but he really had no system.

62
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:57,425
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount
of notes but he'd get them all mixed up.

63
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,636
You really do need a system if...

64
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,763
...if you’re gonna make it work.

65
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:54,858
(presses bell)

66
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,611
- Hi.
- Hi.

67
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:01,948
- I'm Mr Shelby from 304.
- What can l do for you, Leonard?

68
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:03,950
- Um...
- Burt.

69
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:07,328
Burt. I'm not sure, l think
l may have asked you to hold my calls.

70
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:10,290
- You don't know?
- I'm not too good on the phone.

71
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:13,084
You said you like to look people in the eye
when you talk to them.

72
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:14,544
Yeah, yeah.

73
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,381
- You don't remember saying that.
- l have this condition.

74
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,925
- A condition?
- It's my memory.

75
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:23,553
- Amnesia?
- No, no, it's different from that.

76
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,891
l have no short-term memory.
l know all about myself, l just...

77
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,770
Since my injury l can't make
new memories. Everything fades.

78
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:35,398
lf we talk for too long
I'll forget how we started...

79
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:38,151
...and next time l see you
l won't remember this conversation.

80
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:40,737
l don't even know if I've met you before.

81
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,949
So if l seem a little strange
or rude, or something, uh...

82
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:48,453
I've told you this before, haven't l?

83
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:52,624
l don't mean to mess with you
but it's so weird.

84
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:54,918
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.

85
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:57,837
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.

86
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,924
What's the last thing you remember?

87
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,218
My wife.

88
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:05,637
What's it like?

89
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:11,768
It's like waking.

90
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,229
It's like you just woke up.

91
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,898
That must suck.

92
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,566
It's all backwards.

93
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,611
Like, maybe you got an idea
about what you want to do next...

94
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,863
...but you don't remember
what you just did.

95
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,616
l mean, I'm exactly the opposite...

96
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:29,786
- How long have l been staying here?
- Couple of days.

97
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,288
- And you're holding my calls?
- Like you said.

98
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,791
OK, but this guy's an exception.

99
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,292
You know this guy?

100
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,548
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?
- What makes you think that?

101
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,008
- l saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.

102
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:45,427
OK.

103
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,305
lf he calls or shows up here,
give me a call in my room, OK?

104
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,433
- What, his name's Teddy?
- Teddy, yeah.

105
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:53,309
All right.

106
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:56,646
Look, l hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

107
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,023
Not as long as you remember
to pay the bill.

108
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,776
Yeah. OK.

109
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,153
Forty.

110
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:06,406
This guy.

111
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,492
He's here already.

112
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:13,329
Lenny!

113
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:18,626
You really need a system
if you’re gonna make it work.

114
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,214
You kinda learn to trust your handwriting.
It becomes an important part of your life.

115
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:27,260
You write yourself notes.
Where you put them is really important.

116
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,055
You need a jacket that's got,
like, six pockets,...

117
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:32,182
...particular pockets
for particular things.

118
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:36,686
You just kinda learn to know where
things go and how the system works.

119
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,147
You have to be wary of other people
writing stuff for you...

120
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,358
...that is not going to make sense
or is gonna lead you astray.

121
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,611
l don't know what makes people
take advantage...

122
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,738
...of somebody with this condition.

123
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:50,742
If you have a piece of information
which... is...

124
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:55,413
...vital, writing on your body instead of
on a piece of paper can be the answer.

125
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:57,540
It's a permanent way of keeping a note.

126
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:59,709
(phone rings)

127
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:06,591
Who is this?

128
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,060
Remember Sammy Jankis.

129
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:29,948
(door opens)

130
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,800
- Sir, you left these at your table.
- Thanks.

131
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,928
Ah, Lincoln Street?

132
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,847
Just go straight out on Sixth Street,...

133
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,099
- ...go east through town...
- I'm gonna write this down.

134
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,519
- Oh, it's easy. Go straight out...
- Trust me, l need to write this down.

135
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:08,486
The Discount Inn.

136
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,304
Discount Inn.

137
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:37,182
Natalie.

138
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:40,560
My car.

139
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,272
Teddy.

140
00:12:57,118 --> 00:12:59,162
John Edward Gammell.

141
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,832
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

142
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,714
Don't believe his lies.

143
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:18,431
(dials)

144
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,227
(ringing tone)

145
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:27,107
- Yeah?
- Mr Gammell?

146
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,234
- Lenny, is that you?
- John Gammell?

147
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:31,694
Lenny, it's Teddy.
Stay there. I'll be right over.

148
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:34,864
- OK. I'll be waiting.
- (line goes dead)

149
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,341
White male.

150
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:38,553
First name, John.

151
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:42,515
Last name G for Gammell.

152
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:48,563
Drugs.

153
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:50,273
License plate.

154
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:53,777
SG1 3...

155
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,697
...7IU.

156
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,412
It's him.

157
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,587
I've found you, you fuck.

158
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:16,401
You said we talked before.
l don't remember that.

159
00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:18,528
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.

160
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,989
l remember up until my injury,
l just can't make new memories.

161
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:23,366
So l can't remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?

162
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,493
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

163
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:28,204
l guess l tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

164
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,499
Sammy's story helps me understand
my own situation.

165
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:34,294
Sammy wrote himself
endless amounts of notes.

166
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:36,254
But he got mixed up.

167
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,717
l have a more graceful solution
to the memory problem.

168
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,429
I'm disciplined and organized.

169
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:47,307
l use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

170
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:49,768
Sammy had no drive,...

171
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:51,895
...no reason to make it work.

172
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:53,396
Me?

173
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:55,940
Yeah,...

174
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,068
...l got a reason.

175
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:11,831
(activates alarm)

176
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,421
Today, 1pm, meet Natalie for info.

177
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,760
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.

178
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:43,321
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

179
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:46,157
- l should've explained. l have this cond...
- You did explain, Lenny.

180
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:49,911
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

181
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:53,540
- l know, you told me.
- Then l probably told you l hated it.

182
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:55,583
Yeah.

183
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,545
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to...

184
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,922
Thanks.

185
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:03,591
So, you have information for me?

186
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:06,428
- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.

187
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,973
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

188
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:13,476
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list
and you'll end up eating your underwear.

189
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,355
l guess that's why you have
those freaky tattoos.

190
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:20,024
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

191
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:24,654
Look, I'm sorry l don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.

192
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:30,285
l do have information for you.

193
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,954
You gave me a license-plate number.

194
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:36,499
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

195
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,418
Guess what name came up?

196
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:43,006
John Edward Gammell. John G.

197
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:44,382
Do you know him?

198
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:48,178
No. But his face on his driver's license
looked really familiar.

199
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:50,972
l think he's been in the bar, maybe.

200
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:54,517
Here's a copy of his license,
his registration, photo and all.

201
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,644
Are you sure you want this?

202
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:59,397
- Have l told you what this man did?
- Yeah.

203
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:01,858
Well, then you shouldn't have to ask.

204
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,194
Even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

205
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,321
You're not even gonna know it happened.

206
00:19:06,404 --> 00:19:09,699
My wife deserves vengeance. It doesn't
make any difference if l know about it.

207
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:12,118
Just because
there are things l don't remember...

208
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,537
...doesn't make my actions meaningless.

209
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:18,166
The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes.

210
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,961
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph
to remind myself.

211
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:24,089
Get another freaky tattoo.

212
00:19:28,343 --> 00:19:30,595
Tell me about her again.

213
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,014
Why?

214
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,892
Because you like to remember her.

215
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:39,813
She was beautiful.

216
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,608
- To me she was perfect.
- No.

217
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:46,528
Don't just recite the words.

218
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:51,074
Close your eyes and remember her.

219
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,753
You can just feel the details.

220
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:09,801
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

221
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,434
And you can feel these extreme moments.

222
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,310
Even if you don't want to.

223
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,941
You put these together
and you get the feel of a person.

224
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:29,446
Enough to know
how much you miss them.

225
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:39,706
And how much you hate the person
who took them away.

226
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,052
l, um, l added an address in here.

227
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:55,555
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.

228
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:58,558
Um, l guy l knew
used to do bigger deals there.

229
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:02,687
It's isolated.

230
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:04,814
Sounds perfect.

231
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:10,612
- Do l owe you any...
- l wasn't helping you for money.

232
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,906
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

233
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:15,075
See, you have this condition.

234
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:21,081
You still staying at the Discount Inn?
Room 304? Left it at my place.

235
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,129
Yeah.

236
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:32,801
- They treating you OK?
- l don't remember.

237
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,764
You know what we have in common?

238
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:42,143
We are both survivors.

239
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:47,524
You take care, Leonard.

240
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:17,429
Remember Sammy Jankis.

241
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:22,600
l met Sammy through work. Insurance.
l was an investigator.

242
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:25,186
I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phony.

243
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,313
l had to see through people's bullshit.

244
00:22:27,397 --> 00:22:30,108
It was useful experience
cos now it's my life.

245
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:33,486
When l meet someone,
l don't know if I've met them before.

246
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,030
l have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

247
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:39,409
My job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was let them talk.

248
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,369
Watch the eyes and the body language.

249
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:45,498
lf someone scratches their nose,
experts tell you it means they're lying.

250
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:49,169
It really means they're nervous. People
get nervous for all sorts of reasons.

251
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,378
It's all about context.

252
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,547
Yeah, l was good.

253
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,633
Sammy was my first real challenge.

254
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:58,970
(engine starts)

255
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:05,393
Yo, Lenny! l thought you'd split for good.

256
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:07,854
- Well, things change.
- So l see.

257
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:11,066
- My name's Teddy.
- l guess I've told you about my condition.

258
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:15,111
Only every time l see ya.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

259
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:23,036
- Have l told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Mmm. Yeah.

260
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:25,163
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.

261
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:27,457
What about John G?
You think he's still here?

262
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:30,085
- Who?
- Johnny G, the guy you're looking for.

263
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,670
- That's why you haven't left town, right?
- Maybe.

264
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:36,049
- Leonard, you have to be very careful.
- Why?

265
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:39,219
You mentioned that maybe somebody
was trying to set you up.

266
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:40,845
Get you to kill the wrong guy.

267
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,516
l go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

268
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:47,685
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

269
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:50,563
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

270
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,357
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please.

271
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,152
No, really. Memory's not perfect,
it's not even that good. Ask the police.

272
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,571
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

273
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:01,241
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

274
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:04,285
- They collect facts and draw conclusions.
- That's not what I'm saying.

275
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:06,579
Facts, not memories.

276
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:08,957
That's how you investigate.
l know, it's what l used to do.

277
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:13,002
Memory can change the shape of a room,
it can change the color of a car.

278
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:15,463
And memories can be distorted.

279
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,590
They're an interpretation, not a record.

280
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,759
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

281
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:22,846
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

282
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,474
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

283
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:31,020
He destroyed my ability to live.

284
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:35,358
You're living.

285
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,153
Only for revenge.

286
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:40,530
Well, then we'll get the bastard.

287
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,824
Where are you staying?

288
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,748
The Discount Inn. l don't know what room.
l haven't got my key.

289
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:52,042
Probably left it in your room.

290
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:04,637
(rings bell)

291
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,307
Hi.

292
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,601
I'm checked in here
but l think I've misplaced my key.

293
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:13,938
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

294
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:35,210
- l don't see my key anywhere.
- Oh, shit. This is the wrong room.

295
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:37,212
You're in 304. I'm sorry. l fucked up.

296
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:40,048
- This is not my room?
- No. Come on, let's go.

297
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:41,966
Then why is this my handwriting?

298
00:25:45,804 --> 00:25:50,100
Well,... this was your room
but now you're in 304.

299
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:52,435
- When was l in here?
- Last week.

300
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,980
- Then l rented you another room on top.
- Why?

301
00:25:56,064 --> 00:26:00,652
Business is slow, l mean, l told my boss
about your condition and stuff,...

302
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:02,487
...he said rent him another room.

303
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,864
So how many rooms am l checked into
in this shit hole?

304
00:26:04,948 --> 00:26:07,367
Just two. So far.

305
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,159
Well,...

306
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:10,954
...at least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

307
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:15,542
- You're not going to remember anyway.
- You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

308
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:18,420
Leonard. Always get a receipt.

309
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:21,548
Oh, yeah. I'll write that down.

310
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:26,970
- Hey, what time is it?
- Quarter to one.

311
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:29,180
Excuse me.

312
00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:30,807
Your room's...

313
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:45,655
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

314
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,908
I'd just become an investigator
when l came across Sammy.

315
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:52,746
Mr Samuel R Jankis, strangest case ever.

316
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:55,999
The guy's a 58-year-old,
semiretired accountant.

317
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,376
He and his wife were in this car accident,
nothing serious.

318
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,629
But he's acting funny,
he can't get a handle on what's going on.

319
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:06,801
The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive.

320
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:10,555
Sammy can't remember anything
for more than a couple of minutes.

321
00:27:10,638 --> 00:27:12,057
Can't work, can't do shit.

322
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,351
The medical bills pile up, his wife calls
the insurance company and l get sent in.

323
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,691
This is my first big claims investigation
so l really check into it.

324
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:25,528
Sammy can think just fine
but he can't make new memories.

325
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:28,114
He can only remember things
for a couple of minutes.

326
00:27:29,824 --> 00:27:33,078
He'd watch TV but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing,...

327
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:35,288
...he couldn't remember how it began.

328
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:37,624
He liked commercials. They were short.

329
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:39,626
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

330
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:42,796
The crazy part was that this guy,...

331
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:45,465
...who couldn't follow
the plot of Green Acres any more,...

332
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:47,634
...could do the most complicated things,...

333
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:49,928
...as long as he learned them
before the accident...

334
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:54,641
...and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.

335
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:58,561
The doctors assure me...

336
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:02,899
...there's a real condition, arterial-grade
memory loss, or short-term memory loss.

337
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:04,984
It's rare but legit.

338
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:09,155
But every time l see him,...

339
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:11,616
...l catch this look,...

340
00:28:12,075 --> 00:28:15,120
...this... slight look of recognition.

341
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:17,997
But he says he can't remember me at all.

342
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:20,750
Sammy, it's OK. l got it.

343
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:23,461
- Hi, Mr Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs Jankis.

344
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:27,841
Now, l can read people
and I'm thinking ''bad actor''.

345
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,677
So now I'm suspicious
and l order more tests.

346
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:36,099
Awake.

347
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:40,145
Oh, where am l?

348
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,774
Somebody's bedroom.

349
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:48,862
Oh, it must be her room.

350
00:28:49,821 --> 00:28:51,906
But who is she?

351
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,708
It's only me.

352
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:07,005
- Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah. You?

353
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,633
Oh, shit. Shit.

354
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:12,427
l gotta be someplace.

355
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:17,724
It's pretty weird.

356
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:22,604
It's useful. You never
write a phone number on your hand?

357
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:26,983
l, um, l should be able
to talk to my friend today...

358
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:30,153
- ...about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.

359
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,697
John G's license plate.

360
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,577
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

361
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:57,931
Natalie.

362
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,062
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.

363
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:11,277
lf it's registered in this state,...

364
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:13,613
...it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his license and registration.

365
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:16,116
I'll call you as soon as l talk to him.

366
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:19,160
Could we arrange a meeting now?
I'm not too good on the phone.

367
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:30,755
You know, it's great that you...

368
00:30:30,922 --> 00:30:32,799
Well, that you're...

369
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:34,759
...helping me...

370
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:36,428
...like this.

371
00:30:36,553 --> 00:30:39,889
I'm helping you because you helped me.

372
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:54,404
So next time you see me,...

373
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:55,989
...will you remember me?

374
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:15,258
(softly) l think you will.

375
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:18,470
(softly) I'm sorry.

376
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:24,434
Lenny, before you go,
could l have my shirt back, please?

377
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,989
(engine starts)

378
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:43,661
Yo, Lenny! l thought you'd split for good.

379
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:46,748
Sammy couldn't pick up
any new skills at all.

380
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:49,209
But l find something in my research.

381
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:50,919
Conditioning.

382
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:53,922
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

383
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:57,342
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You get better through practice.

384
00:31:57,425 --> 00:31:59,719
It's a different part of the brain
from the short-term memory.

385
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:03,390
So l had the doctors
test Sammy's response to conditioning.

386
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:07,644
- Pick up any three objects.
- That's a test?

387
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:10,063
Where were you guys when l did my CPA?

388
00:32:10,188 --> 00:32:11,564
Sorry.

389
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:15,151
Ta-da!

390
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,113
- (buzz)
- Ow! What the fuck?

391
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:20,573
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.

392
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:26,371
Some of the objects were electrified.
They'd give him a shock.

393
00:32:26,454 --> 00:32:29,582
They kept repeating the test,
always with the same objects electrified.

394
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:33,128
The point was to see if Sammy could
learn to avoid the electrified objects,...

395
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:35,422
...not by memory, but by instinct.

396
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:46,349
(activates alarm)

397
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:52,897
(knocks on door)

398
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:58,820
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

399
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:04,033
Guess l don't have to worry about him
any more.

400
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:06,077
- What the fuck have you got me into?
- Shh. Come inside.

401
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:13,334
- Who is he?
- Calm down. OK?

402
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:16,880
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It's nothing to do with your investigation.

403
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:18,506
How did you get me into this?

404
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,633
You offered to help me
when you saw what he did to my face.

405
00:33:20,717 --> 00:33:24,262
- How do l know he did that to your face?
- l came straight to you after he did it.

406
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:26,639
l showed you what he did
and l asked you to help me.

407
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:29,601
- Oh, and l just take your word?
- Yeah.

408
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:32,228
Something doesn't feel right.

409
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:34,773
l think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

410
00:33:34,856 --> 00:33:36,191
- Did you?
- What?

411
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:38,109
Kill him?

412
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:41,696
- Course not!
- Hey. Sit down, OK? Sit.

413
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:47,368
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out and I'm grateful.

414
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:49,788
You have to burn them.

415
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:57,295
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust your own judgment.

416
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,882
You can question everything,
you can never know anything for sure.

417
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:03,593
- There are things you know for sure.
- Such as?

418
00:34:04,636 --> 00:34:08,348
l know what that's gonna sound like
when l knock on it. (knocks)

419
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:11,810
l know what that's gonna feel like
when l pick it up. See?

420
00:34:11,893 --> 00:34:14,729
Certainties. It's the kind of memory
you take for granted.

421
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:19,192
You know, l can remember so much.

422
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:22,404
The feel of the world...

423
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:24,948
And her.

424
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:32,789
She's gone.

425
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:36,793
And the present is trivia
which l scribble down as fucking notes.

426
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:39,546
Hey, come on. Try and relax. Come on.

427
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:42,716
- It's not easy for me to relax.
- Shh. Shhh.

428
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:45,135
Come on, take your jacket off.

429
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:47,595
(softly) Here. Come on.

430
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:50,890
(softly) Hey.

431
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,268
Didn't think you were the type.

432
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,654
It's backwards.

433
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:08,324
Come here. Come here.

434
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:31,931
What about here?

435
00:35:33,516 --> 00:35:35,977
Maybe it's... for when l find him.

436
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,274
I've lost somebody too.

437
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:44,569
I'm sorry.

438
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:46,571
His name was Jimmy.

439
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:49,032
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.

440
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:52,077
He never came back.

441
00:35:53,203 --> 00:35:56,247
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

442
00:35:57,123 --> 00:35:59,167
What do the police think?

443
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:03,171
They don't look too hard
for guys like Jimmy.

444
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:06,508
When you find this guy, this...

445
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:09,844
...John G, what are you gonna do?

446
00:36:12,263 --> 00:36:14,307
I'm gonna kill him.

447
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:18,895
Maybe l can help you find him.

448
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:26,778
l don't even know how long
she's been gone.

449
00:36:29,864 --> 00:36:33,535
It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here...

450
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:39,457
...because she's gone to the bathroom
or something.

451
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:45,171
But somehow l just...

452
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:50,260
l just know
she's never gonna come back to bed.

453
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:56,307
lf l could just...

454
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:00,437
...reach over
and touch her side of the bed,...

455
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,524
...l would know that it was cold.

456
00:37:06,776 --> 00:37:08,987
But l can't.

457
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,743
l know l can't have her back.

458
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:21,458
But l don't want to wake up in the morning
thinking she's still here.

459
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,546
l lie here not knowing
how long I've been alone.

460
00:37:32,427 --> 00:37:34,429
So how...

461
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:37,182
How can l heal?

462
00:37:39,642 --> 00:37:42,812
How am l supposed to heal if l can't...

463
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:45,690
...feel time?

464
00:38:57,846 --> 00:39:02,600
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.

465
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:30,462
They kept testing Sammy for months.

466
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:33,465
Always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.

467
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,633
- (buzz)
- Ow! What the fuck?

468
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:38,136
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

469
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,346
Even with total short-term memory loss,...

470
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,850
...Sammy should have learned instinctively
to stop picking up the wrong objects.

471
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:47,937
Other cases responded to conditioning,
Sammy didn't respond at all.

472
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:51,608
It suggested that his condition
was psychological not physical.

473
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:56,237
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

474
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:59,866
His wife got stuck with the bills
and l got a big promotion.

475
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:04,412
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

476
00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:06,539
But it works for me.

477
00:40:06,664 --> 00:40:08,750
l live the way Sammy couldn't.

478
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,294
Habit and routine make my life possible.

479
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:14,172
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

480
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:19,386
(muffled cries)

481
00:40:21,471 --> 00:40:22,347
(smash)

482
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:25,225
Awake.

483
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,602
Where am l?

484
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:31,106
Motel room.

485
00:40:31,564 --> 00:40:33,608
Oh.

486
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:40,115
Some anonymous motel room.

487
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,080
Nothing in the drawers.
But I'll take a look anyway.

488
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:49,249
Nothing except the Gideon Bi...

489
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:51,209
Bible.

490
00:41:04,222 --> 00:41:06,558
- (knock on door)
- Hey! Open up!

491
00:41:07,976 --> 00:41:10,061
- (muffled cries)
- Just a minute!

492
00:41:10,145 --> 00:41:11,980
Open the door!

493
00:41:12,814 --> 00:41:15,608
- (muffled cries)
- (knocks) Lenny?

494
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:19,487
(knocking continues) Open the door!

495
00:41:23,616 --> 00:41:25,660
Come on!

496
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:30,915
- Hi, Teddy.
- Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

497
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:34,461
- Oh!
- (muffled cries)

498
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:40,967
(sighs)

499
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:45,055
- (muffled cries)
- Oh, l get it.

500
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:48,391
- Amorous neighbors.
- What are you doing here?

501
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:52,145
(laughs) You called me.
You said you needed my help.

502
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:55,774
You know, I've had more
rewarding friendships than this one.

503
00:41:55,857 --> 00:41:59,235
Although l do get to keep telling
the same jokes.

504
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:01,071
What the fuck is that?

505
00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:08,995
Who the fuck is that?

506
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:11,122
- You don't know him?
- No! Should l?

507
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:15,460
- Wait a minute. Is that John G?
- l don't think so.

508
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:17,545
You don't think so?
You didn't write it down?

509
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:20,965
- l might have fallen asleep before l did.
- For Christ sakes!

510
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,094
Ask him.

511
00:42:27,764 --> 00:42:30,433
What's your name? Your name?

512
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,894
- Dodd.
- And who did this to you?

513
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:35,021
- What?
- Who did this to you?

514
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,690
You did.

515
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:43,696
- I'm not going to help you kill that guy.
- No, no. Just let me think for a minute.

516
00:42:47,075 --> 00:42:49,077
(muffled cries)

517
00:42:49,411 --> 00:42:52,372
OK, Natalie. Who's Natalie? Natalie who?

518
00:42:52,497 --> 00:42:54,749
- Why?
- Maybe l know her.

519
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,419
Look, we gotta get him out of here.

520
00:42:57,502 --> 00:42:59,546
All right, all right, all right.

521
00:43:00,463 --> 00:43:02,507
He's got to have a car, right?

522
00:43:02,632 --> 00:43:05,969
We take him to his car, tell him to get the
fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

523
00:43:06,052 --> 00:43:08,096
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

524
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:10,515
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- l don't know!

525
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:13,059
- You don't know.
- (muffled banging)

526
00:43:14,436 --> 00:43:18,314
Yes, l do. This is not my room.
It must be his room. Great. Let's go.

527
00:43:18,398 --> 00:43:20,442
- No, no, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

528
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:25,697
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

529
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:29,743
OK. We untie him, we clean him up...

530
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:31,911
...and we march him out of here
with a gun in his back.

531
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:34,080
A gun. Why would l have a gun?

532
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:39,502
It must be his. l don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

533
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:41,629
Fucking hope not.

534
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:51,056
Which one?

535
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:56,227
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

536
00:43:56,311 --> 00:43:59,314
- Shut up.
- It's all right for you, you've got the Jag.

537
00:43:59,397 --> 00:44:02,484
All right, get in.
I'm gonna ride with him, you follow us.

538
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,611
Give me your keys.

539
00:44:04,694 --> 00:44:06,738
Take your own car.

540
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,850
So was he scared?

541
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:37,852
l think it was your sinister moustache.

542
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:40,772
Fuck you. Should have stolen his car.

543
00:44:40,897 --> 00:44:44,818
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?

544
00:44:47,153 --> 00:44:49,155
So what do you do now?

545
00:44:49,322 --> 00:44:52,492
I'm gonna find out
what the fuck that was all about.

546
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,956
(knocks)

547
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:01,793
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

548
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,424
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him.

549
00:45:07,507 --> 00:45:10,635
And fighting the company's decision.

550
00:45:11,094 --> 00:45:13,763
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

551
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:16,266
l never said that Sammy was faking.

552
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:18,435
Sammy, l have an idea.

553
00:45:18,518 --> 00:45:21,855
Just that his problem was mental,
not physical.

554
00:45:21,938 --> 00:45:24,607
You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.

555
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:26,568
She couldn't understand.

556
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:29,279
- l did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

557
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:32,699
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try a little harder.

558
00:45:32,782 --> 00:45:35,785
She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person...

559
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,455
...and if it's not a physical problem,
he should snap out of it.

560
00:45:38,538 --> 00:45:39,539
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called.

561
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:42,625
Ellen called.
Ellen... Ellen can't come today!

562
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:45,295
- Ellen can't come!
- I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

563
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:47,756
- I'm trying! I'm sorry!
- (sobs)

564
00:45:50,759 --> 00:45:55,513
So, Leonard Shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed of doubt.

565
00:45:55,597 --> 00:45:58,308
Just like he gave it to the doctors.

566
00:45:58,391 --> 00:46:00,727
But l never said that he was faking.

567
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,854
l never said that.

568
00:46:07,692 --> 00:46:10,320
Hm. l don't feel drunk.

569
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:44,354
(door closes)

570
00:46:53,905 --> 00:46:55,990
(toilet flushes)

571
00:47:22,726 --> 00:47:24,728
- Hello? Housekeeping.
- Oh, shit!

572
00:47:25,562 --> 00:47:28,523
- Not right now!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

573
00:47:56,634 --> 00:48:01,681
Dodd. Put him onto Teddy
or just get rid of him for Natalie.

574
00:48:06,644 --> 00:48:08,688
Dodd.

575
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:16,696
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.

576
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:20,116
Teddy, Teddy.

577
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:24,454
(dialing tone)

578
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:28,249
(ringing)

579
00:48:30,794 --> 00:48:33,004
Yeah, leave your number,
you know what to do.

580
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:36,091
- (beep)
- Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

581
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:38,343
I'm at the Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street,
room six.

582
00:48:38,468 --> 00:48:41,304
l need you to come over
as soon as you get this. It's important.

583
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:43,556
Oh, this is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

584
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:47,727
Phew!

585
00:48:48,103 --> 00:48:49,854
Fuck!

586
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:02,492
Mrs Jankis didn't understand that you
can't bully someone into remembering.

587
00:49:02,617 --> 00:49:05,662
The more pressure you're under,
the harder it gets.

588
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:09,499
Ah. Well, then, call me back?

589
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,642
(car alarm, car horn)

590
00:49:31,062 --> 00:49:33,106
OK. So what am l doing?

591
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:37,068
Oh, I'm chasing this guy.

592
00:49:39,612 --> 00:49:42,532
No. He's chasing me.

593
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,204
(car alarm, car horn)

594
00:49:50,415 --> 00:49:52,459
(clicks off alarm)

595
00:50:01,843 --> 00:50:03,219
(tires squeal)

596
00:50:03,928 --> 00:50:05,972
Ah! Fuck!

597
00:50:10,101 --> 00:50:14,064
Dodd, white guy,
Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street.

598
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,317
I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.

599
00:50:54,813 --> 00:50:56,856
Oh, fuck!

600
00:50:58,066 --> 00:51:00,110
Sorry.

601
00:51:33,518 --> 00:51:35,562
l need a weapon.

602
00:51:38,857 --> 00:51:39,983
This'll do.

603
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:06,217
Hm. l don't feel drunk.

604
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:38,375
(clicks off alarm)

605
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:45,048
(car horn)

606
00:52:45,465 --> 00:52:47,509
(car horn)

607
00:52:47,717 --> 00:52:49,803
Do l know this guy?

608
00:52:50,595 --> 00:52:52,806
- (car horn)
- He seems to know me.

609
00:52:57,685 --> 00:52:59,729
- What the fuck?
- (tires squeal)

610
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:14,911
- l like your car.
- Thank you.

611
00:53:14,994 --> 00:53:16,996
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

612
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,499
What, l haven't made
a strong enough impression on you?

613
00:53:19,582 --> 00:53:22,293
- l wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
- (taps on window)

614
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:29,175
(car alarm, car horn)

615
00:53:32,303 --> 00:53:34,597
OK. So what am l doing?

616
00:53:42,105 --> 00:53:44,149
(phone rings)

617
00:53:44,899 --> 00:53:46,943
Who is this?

618
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:52,866
(clicks off alarm)

619
00:54:29,986 --> 00:54:31,988
(activates car alarm)

620
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:08,149
Ouch! Cut it out.

621
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:42,100
- How can you read that again?
- It's good.

622
00:55:42,183 --> 00:55:46,896
- You've read it, like, a thousand times.
- l enjoy it.

623
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,900
l thought the pleasure of a book was
in wanting to know what happens next.

624
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:54,529
Don't be a prick.
I'm not reading it to annoy you. l enjoy it.

625
00:55:56,448 --> 00:55:59,117
Just let me read. Please?

626
00:56:09,836 --> 00:56:12,255
Probably tried this before.

627
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:17,677
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

628
00:56:19,721 --> 00:56:22,307
Can't remember to forget you.

629
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:41,117
Yeah.

630
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:43,286
Uh-huh.

631
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:48,583
Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

632
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:51,836
l was hoping for more on the drugs angle.
Will you hang on a sec?

633
00:57:00,929 --> 00:57:03,681
The police report mentioned the drugs
found in the car outside my house.

634
00:57:03,765 --> 00:57:05,850
The car was stolen.
His prints were all over it.

635
00:57:05,934 --> 00:57:07,977
l got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy.

636
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:10,021
l dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job.

637
00:57:10,105 --> 00:57:15,652
With my condition it's really tough.
l can't keep it all in mind at once.

638
00:57:15,735 --> 00:57:17,487
l have to summarize the sections.

639
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:20,740
There are pages missing.
l guess I've been trying to log them all.

640
00:57:20,824 --> 00:57:23,118
l don't know why these are crossed out.

641
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:25,286
They weren't even looking for John G.

642
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:28,123
The stuff they found in the car fit in with
what they believed had happened,...

643
00:57:28,206 --> 00:57:30,417
...so they didn't chase it up.

644
00:57:31,501 --> 00:57:33,545
(door slams)

645
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,162
Honey?

646
00:58:09,622 --> 00:58:11,624
Honey, it's late.

647
00:58:33,605 --> 00:58:35,607
Everything OK?

648
00:58:35,982 --> 00:58:37,358
(muffled cry)

649
00:58:47,118 --> 00:58:48,953
(taps on door)

650
00:58:51,998 --> 00:58:54,417
- (muffled gasp)
- You OK in there?

651
00:58:57,379 --> 00:58:59,881
(sniffs) Was it good for you?

652
00:58:59,964 --> 00:59:02,008
(laughs softly)

653
00:59:02,092 --> 00:59:04,969
What? Was l supposed to lock the door?

654
00:59:06,137 --> 00:59:07,972
(softly) No.

655
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:11,351
I'd like you to leave now.

656
00:59:22,195 --> 00:59:24,239
(clicks off alarm)

657
00:59:31,871 --> 00:59:35,458
There's something about the drugs
stashed in the car that doesn't ring true.

658
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:39,796
The police claim the guy was an addict
needing money to score. It's bullshit.

659
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,134
He's not gonna go breaking into places
while he's still got a stash that big.

660
00:59:44,426 --> 00:59:47,095
Well, l think John G left it there.
Or planted it there.

661
00:59:48,847 --> 00:59:50,890
How do you know that?

662
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:54,894
Oh, shit, that's true. It fits.

663
00:59:54,978 --> 00:59:57,021
So he's a dealer.

664
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,607
Hang on a sec.

665
01:00:09,451 --> 01:00:11,619
Now we're getting somewhere.

666
01:00:12,328 --> 01:00:13,705
Discount Inn.

667
01:00:18,251 --> 01:00:20,253
(activates alarm)

668
01:00:30,221 --> 01:00:32,265
(activates alarm)

669
01:01:06,549 --> 01:01:08,134
Yeah, OK.

670
01:01:08,218 --> 01:01:10,261
Blonde's fine.

671
01:01:11,137 --> 01:01:13,181
Well, that's what they say.

672
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:16,309
The Discount Inn. 304.

673
01:01:17,394 --> 01:01:19,187
Leonard.

674
01:01:19,854 --> 01:01:21,189
Well, what then?

675
01:01:21,272 --> 01:01:24,359
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

676
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:26,653
You go into the bathroom
and slam the door.

677
01:01:26,736 --> 01:01:29,322
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

678
01:01:29,406 --> 01:01:31,324
- And that's it?
- That's it.

679
01:01:31,825 --> 01:01:32,867
Ah...

680
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,163
Yeah, first l just need you
to put these things around the room.

681
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:42,335
Pretend they're your things
and this is your bedroom.

682
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:00,019
- Should l wear it?
- No, no, no. Uh, just like you took it off.

683
01:02:03,648 --> 01:02:05,442
l don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

684
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:12,657
l just mean put them around the room,
as if they were your... your things.

685
01:02:16,286 --> 01:02:18,371
Whatever gets you off.

686
01:02:38,725 --> 01:02:40,769
(door slams)

687
01:02:42,395 --> 01:02:45,732
l can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.

688
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:48,735
This is a difficult condition to understand.
Look at Sammy Jankis.

689
01:02:48,818 --> 01:02:50,904
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

690
01:02:50,987 --> 01:02:53,656
l told you how she tried to get him
to snap out of it.

691
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:56,117
She came to see me at the office.
l found out all kinds of shit.

692
01:02:56,201 --> 01:02:59,704
She told me about life with Sammy.
How she treated him.

693
01:02:59,788 --> 01:03:01,206
Thank you for seeing me.

694
01:03:01,289 --> 01:03:04,000
She'd get Sammy to hide food
around the house,...

695
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,878
...then she'd stop feeding him to see
if his hunger would make him remember.

696
01:03:07,003 --> 01:03:10,256
I've taken him to a parking lot and, uh...

697
01:03:10,382 --> 01:03:13,927
She wasn't a cruel person.
She just wanted her old Sammy back.

698
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:16,846
You know all about Sammy
and you've decided he's faking.

699
01:03:16,888 --> 01:03:19,682
The company's position
isn't that Sammy's faking anything,...

700
01:03:19,766 --> 01:03:22,060
...just that his condition
can't be shown to be...

701
01:03:22,143 --> 01:03:24,104
l just want to know
your honest opinion about Sammy.

702
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:28,108
We shouldn't be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

703
01:03:28,191 --> 01:03:31,444
- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?

704
01:03:31,528 --> 01:03:37,450
Try to understand, when l look at Sammy,
l don't see some... vegetable.

705
01:03:37,575 --> 01:03:40,078
l see my same old Sammy.

706
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:42,914
What do you think that's like for me,...

707
01:03:42,997 --> 01:03:46,167
...to suspect that he might be imagining
this whole problem?

708
01:03:46,251 --> 01:03:48,378
That if l just could say the right thing,...

709
01:03:48,461 --> 01:03:52,632
...he'd snap out of it
and go back to being normal.

710
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:55,009
lf l...

711
01:03:56,302 --> 01:03:59,639
lf l knew that my old Sammy
were truly gone,...

712
01:03:59,723 --> 01:04:04,728
...then l could say goodbye
and start loving this new Sammy.

713
01:04:06,646 --> 01:04:09,733
As long as l have doubt
l can't say goodbye and move on.

714
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:11,860
What do you want from me?

715
01:04:11,943 --> 01:04:15,030
l want you to forget the company
you work for thirty seconds...

716
01:04:15,113 --> 01:04:18,491
...and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.

717
01:04:19,784 --> 01:04:21,828
l need to know...

718
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:24,497
...what you honestly believe.

719
01:04:28,793 --> 01:04:32,672
l believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

720
01:04:39,846 --> 01:04:41,723
Thank you.

721
01:04:43,266 --> 01:04:45,310
l thought I'd helped her.

722
01:04:45,393 --> 01:04:49,439
l thought she just needed an answer.
l didn't think it was important what it was.

723
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:52,692
Just that she had one to believe.

724
01:05:07,332 --> 01:05:10,210
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

725
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:13,046
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it!

726
01:05:13,129 --> 01:05:16,007
Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

727
01:05:17,842 --> 01:05:20,845
- Jeez!
- What the fuck are you doing in my car?

728
01:05:20,929 --> 01:05:25,475
What, your sense of humor went with the
memory? Do you know why you're here?

729
01:05:25,558 --> 01:05:27,602
- Unfinished business.
- Lenny,...

730
01:05:27,685 --> 01:05:31,523
...let me inform you,
your business here is very much finished.

731
01:05:31,606 --> 01:05:34,609
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?

732
01:05:34,693 --> 01:05:38,571
Schmuck! Whose house
do you think you just walked out of?

733
01:05:40,198 --> 01:05:44,411
That's right, take a look at your pictures.
l bet you got one of her.

734
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,831
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz(!)

735
01:05:48,998 --> 01:05:51,668
You'll want to make a note.
You can't trust her.

736
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:53,128
Why's that?

737
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:56,506
Because by now
she's taken a look at the suit and the car...

738
01:05:56,589 --> 01:06:00,760
...and she's figuring out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

739
01:06:02,512 --> 01:06:06,015
She's already got you staying with her,
for Christ sakes. You can't go back there.

740
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:08,059
Let me give you the name of a motel.

741
01:06:08,143 --> 01:06:10,770
You're lucky l ran into you.
That broad's bad news.

742
01:06:10,854 --> 01:06:14,357
- What do you mean, ''bad news''?
- She's involved with drugs.

743
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:15,692
Look. See these?

744
01:06:15,775 --> 01:06:20,864
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

745
01:06:20,905 --> 01:06:23,700
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

746
01:06:23,783 --> 01:06:26,453
He writes messages
on the back of these,...

747
01:06:26,578 --> 01:06:29,205
...then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

748
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:33,293
- Why should l care?
- Because when she gets jammed up,...

749
01:06:33,376 --> 01:06:35,420
...she's gonna use you to protect herself.

750
01:06:35,503 --> 01:06:36,963
From who?

751
01:06:37,047 --> 01:06:39,674
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

752
01:06:39,799 --> 01:06:42,093
Guys are gonna come after her.

753
01:06:42,177 --> 01:06:44,971
Somebody's got to pay, Lenny.
Somebody always pays.

754
01:06:45,055 --> 01:06:46,473
Maybe she'll make it you.

755
01:06:46,556 --> 01:06:50,101
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

756
01:06:50,185 --> 01:06:52,437
You worried
that she's gonna use me against you?

757
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,564
- No.
- Why not?

758
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:57,525
Because she doesn't know who l am.

759
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:01,071
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe l wanna help.

760
01:07:01,196 --> 01:07:05,283
She doesn't know anything
about your investigation. OK, Einstein?

761
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:07,535
So write this down.

762
01:07:08,078 --> 01:07:12,290
When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.

763
01:07:12,707 --> 01:07:17,420
I'm not lying.
Take my pen, write this down.

764
01:07:17,504 --> 01:07:19,756
Do not trust her.

765
01:07:26,846 --> 01:07:28,932
There. You happy now?

766
01:07:28,973 --> 01:07:31,851
- l won't be happy until you leave town.
- Why not?

767
01:07:31,935 --> 01:07:34,979
You ever wonder
how long you can hang around here...

768
01:07:35,063 --> 01:07:37,440
- ...before people start asking questions?
- What sort of questions?

769
01:07:37,524 --> 01:07:39,651
The same questions
you should be asking yourself.

770
01:07:39,693 --> 01:07:42,445
- Like what?
- Like how did you get this suit, the car?

771
01:07:42,529 --> 01:07:43,905
- l have money.
- From what?

772
01:07:43,988 --> 01:07:47,409
My wife's death. l used to work
in insurance. We were well covered.

773
01:07:47,492 --> 01:07:49,285
Oh!

774
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:54,082
So in your grief
you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?

775
01:07:55,417 --> 01:07:59,337
You don't have a clue, do you?
You don't even know who you are.

776
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:00,714
Yes, l do.

777
01:08:00,797 --> 01:08:04,467
l don't have amnesia. l remember
everything right up until the incident.

778
01:08:04,551 --> 01:08:06,594
l am Leonard Shelby,
l am from San Francisco...

779
01:08:06,678 --> 01:08:08,722
That's who you were.

780
01:08:08,805 --> 01:08:12,350
You do not know who you are.
What you've become since...

781
01:08:13,017 --> 01:08:15,061
...the incident.

782
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:20,108
You wander around playing detective.
You don't even know how long ago it was.

783
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:25,989
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?

784
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:29,826
- l didn't sell insurance, l investigated it.
- Right, right. You're an investigator.

785
01:08:30,618 --> 01:08:35,331
- Maybe you should investigate yourself.
- Oh, thank you for the advice.

786
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:40,086
Look, do me a favor,
don't go back in there.

787
01:08:40,837 --> 01:08:43,882
Will you take the motel out of town?

788
01:08:46,468 --> 01:08:48,803
It's been fun, Lenny.

789
01:08:55,477 --> 01:08:57,520
Do not trust her.

790
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:01,232
Don't believe his lies.

791
01:09:14,662 --> 01:09:17,374
Oh, fuck it. l need my own place.

792
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:20,043
(starts engine)

793
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:26,257
No. She shouldn't have given me
that responsibility.

794
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:29,094
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

795
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:33,640
Yeah, yeah, l guess.

796
01:09:33,723 --> 01:09:36,351
I've got all sorts of other considerations.

797
01:09:37,394 --> 01:09:39,813
Legal responsibility, large financ...

798
01:09:44,067 --> 01:09:47,112
- Who is this?
- (line goes dead)

799
01:09:58,164 --> 01:09:59,416
Write this down.
Write down what happened.

800
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:03,044
Write it down. Come on, concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a p...

801
01:10:09,384 --> 01:10:12,262
- What happened?
- He beat the shit out of me.

802
01:10:12,345 --> 01:10:13,763
Who?

803
01:10:13,972 --> 01:10:15,390
Who?

804
01:10:15,598 --> 01:10:18,059
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

805
01:10:18,143 --> 01:10:19,269
Why?

806
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:22,772
Because of you! Because l did what
you told me to do, reason with him,...

807
01:10:22,856 --> 01:10:26,484
- ...tell him about Teddy. Great idea!
- Calm down. Calm down, take it easy.

808
01:10:26,568 --> 01:10:28,403
You're safe. It's OK.

809
01:10:29,904 --> 01:10:33,241
Come on. Just sit down. Sit down.

810
01:10:34,451 --> 01:10:36,703
Here, sit down.

811
01:10:37,162 --> 01:10:39,205
OK. You're OK.

812
01:10:39,289 --> 01:10:42,167
I'll just get some ice for your face.

813
01:10:49,299 --> 01:10:51,009
Here.

814
01:10:57,015 --> 01:11:00,101
l did exactly what you told me to do.

815
01:11:00,185 --> 01:11:02,312
l went to Dodd...

816
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:07,609
...and l told him
that l didn't have any of Jimmy's money,...

817
01:11:07,984 --> 01:11:10,028
...or the drugs.

818
01:11:10,111 --> 01:11:14,449
And that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

819
01:11:14,532 --> 01:11:16,117
And what did he say?

820
01:11:17,285 --> 01:11:19,704
He didn't believe me.

821
01:11:21,706 --> 01:11:24,959
He said if l don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

822
01:11:25,043 --> 01:11:29,047
And then he just...
he just started hitting me.

823
01:11:29,923 --> 01:11:31,966
Where is he?

824
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,928
- Why?
- I'll go see him.

825
01:11:35,053 --> 01:11:39,265
I'll give him some bruises of his own
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

826
01:11:39,557 --> 01:11:41,810
Oh, he'll kill you, Lenny.

827
01:11:44,145 --> 01:11:47,232
- My wife used to call me Lenny.
- Yeah?

828
01:11:48,775 --> 01:11:50,819
Yeah, l hated it.

829
01:11:51,486 --> 01:11:55,865
Oh, this guy is so dangerous.
Let's just think of something else, OK?

830
01:11:56,533 --> 01:12:00,286
No, no, no.
You just tell me what he looks like.

831
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:02,872
And where l can find him.
Have you got a pen?

832
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:05,834
In my purse.

833
01:12:15,135 --> 01:12:17,804
He'll, um,... he'll probably find you.

834
01:12:17,887 --> 01:12:19,180
What do you mean?

835
01:12:19,264 --> 01:12:21,224
l told him about your car.

836
01:12:21,307 --> 01:12:22,976
Why?

837
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:27,439
He was beating the shit out of me,
l had to tell him something.

838
01:12:29,065 --> 01:12:31,109
Just write it all down.

839
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:48,293
Be careful.

840
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:50,545
I'll be fine.

841
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:00,680
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

842
01:13:03,433 --> 01:13:04,684
(phone rings)

843
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:08,438
(phone rings)

844
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:20,700
Front desk? Burt, right.
This is Mr Shelby in room 21 .

845
01:13:21,743 --> 01:13:23,787
Yeah, that's it, l don't want any calls.

846
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,914
No, none at all.

847
01:13:32,087 --> 01:13:33,088
(door opens)

848
01:13:36,508 --> 01:13:38,885
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

849
01:13:38,968 --> 01:13:41,012
- Who?
- Calls himself Dodd.

850
01:13:41,137 --> 01:13:42,514
What does he want?

851
01:13:42,597 --> 01:13:45,600
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy
and his money. He thinks l took it.

852
01:13:45,642 --> 01:13:46,726
Did you?

853
01:13:47,769 --> 01:13:49,145
No.

854
01:13:53,066 --> 01:13:56,861
- What's this all about?
- You don't have a fucking clue, do you?

855
01:13:56,945 --> 01:13:59,072
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't you?

856
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:02,867
- Look, l have this condition.
- l know all about your fucking condition!

857
01:14:02,951 --> 01:14:06,538
l probably know more about it than you,
you don't have a clue about anything else.

858
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:10,500
- What happened?
- Jimmy went to meet a guy named Teddy.

859
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:13,253
He took a lot of money with him
and never came back.

860
01:14:13,294 --> 01:14:16,339
Jimmy's partners think l set him up.
l don't know if you know this Teddy.

861
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:19,592
- Neither do l.
- Don't protect him! Help me.

862
01:14:19,676 --> 01:14:22,887
- How?
- Get rid of Dodd for me.

863
01:14:22,929 --> 01:14:25,348
- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.

864
01:14:25,432 --> 01:14:28,476
What do you think l am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

865
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,313
What, then? Love?
What would you kill for?

866
01:14:32,397 --> 01:14:35,066
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.

867
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:38,820
- Not to me, l wasn't married to her!
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.

868
01:14:38,903 --> 01:14:40,947
l can talk about whoever the fuck l want!

869
01:14:41,031 --> 01:14:43,450
l can say whatever l want
and you won't remember!

870
01:14:43,533 --> 01:14:45,702
l can call your wife a fucking whore
and we can still be friends.

871
01:14:45,827 --> 01:14:47,454
- Calm down.
- You can't get scared!

872
01:14:47,537 --> 01:14:50,290
You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

873
01:14:50,373 --> 01:14:52,333
This has nothing to do with me.

874
01:14:52,459 --> 01:14:56,379
How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!

875
01:14:56,463 --> 01:14:59,674
- Hey, can you get angry?
- Yes.

876
01:14:59,758 --> 01:15:02,093
You pathetic piece of shit!

877
01:15:02,177 --> 01:15:07,807
l can say whatever the fuck l want and
you won't have a clue, you fucking retard!

878
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:11,978
I'm gonna use you. I'm telling you now
because I'm gonna enjoy it much more...

879
01:15:12,062 --> 01:15:16,149
...if l know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.

880
01:15:16,232 --> 01:15:18,735
Did you lose your pen? Too bad, freak.

881
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:22,822
Otherwise you could write yourself a note
about how much Natalie hates your guts...

882
01:15:22,906 --> 01:15:24,824
...and that l called your wife a whore!

883
01:15:24,908 --> 01:15:26,910
- Don't say another fucking word!
- About your whore of a wife?

884
01:15:30,914 --> 01:15:33,583
l read about your condition, Leonard.

885
01:15:33,666 --> 01:15:39,130
You know one of the causes of short-term
memory loss? Venereal disease.

886
01:15:39,255 --> 01:15:41,007
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife...

887
01:15:41,132 --> 01:15:44,844
...sucked one too many diseased cocks
and turned you into a retard!

888
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:49,516
(softly) You sad, sad freak.

889
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:57,023
l can say whatever the fuck l want
and you won't remember.

890
01:15:57,941 --> 01:16:00,652
We'll still be best friends.

891
01:16:01,194 --> 01:16:03,613
Or maybe even lovers.

892
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,991
Fuck!

893
01:16:12,122 --> 01:16:14,124
I'll see you soon.

894
01:16:21,172 --> 01:16:23,174
- (door opens and closes)
- Stay focused.

895
01:16:23,258 --> 01:16:25,301
Find a pen.

896
01:16:25,385 --> 01:16:27,846
I'm gonna write this down.
I'm gonna write it down.

897
01:16:29,389 --> 01:16:32,726
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate.

898
01:16:32,809 --> 01:16:36,354
Keep it in mind,
keep it in mind, keep it in mind.

899
01:16:38,648 --> 01:16:41,067
Come on. I've got to find a pen.
I've got to find a pen.

900
01:16:41,151 --> 01:16:45,113
Now, write this down, write this down.
Exactly what happened.

901
01:16:45,196 --> 01:16:47,907
I'm gonna write down what happened.
Come on, come on! I've got to find a pen!

902
01:16:47,991 --> 01:16:50,994
Jeez! Come on! Come on, keep focused.

903
01:16:51,077 --> 01:16:51,911
Keep focused.

904
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:55,749
Keep... Keep it in mind.
Come on, find a pen.

905
01:16:55,874 --> 01:16:58,376
Write this note.
Write down what happened. Write it down.

906
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,754
Come on, concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a p...

907
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:10,597
What happened?

908
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,724
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

909
01:17:12,849 --> 01:17:14,851
- Who?
- Who?

910
01:17:14,976 --> 01:17:18,271
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

911
01:17:26,988 --> 01:17:29,032
- (knock at door)
- Hello?

912
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:34,621
It's Burt, from the front desk.

913
01:17:36,373 --> 01:17:37,707
Yeah?

914
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:42,170
l know you said you didn't want any calls
but this guy on the phone says he's a cop.

915
01:17:42,253 --> 01:17:44,297
- A cop?
- Yeah.

916
01:17:44,381 --> 01:17:47,634
He says you're really gonna wanna know
what he has to say.

917
01:17:47,717 --> 01:17:51,012
I'm not too good on the phone.
l need to look people in the eye.

918
01:17:51,096 --> 01:17:52,639
Well, what...

919
01:17:56,476 --> 01:17:59,521
You can, um, you can crash on the couch.

920
01:17:59,604 --> 01:18:02,440
It's comfortable. Just have a seat.

921
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:04,359
Thanks.

922
01:18:09,322 --> 01:18:11,741
So, how long do you think
it's gonna take you?

923
01:18:12,283 --> 01:18:13,159
Hm?

924
01:18:13,326 --> 01:18:16,830
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife.

925
01:18:17,288 --> 01:18:23,211
Oh, it depends on if he's here in town
or if he's moved on. l have my file here.

926
01:18:25,088 --> 01:18:27,132
Can l ask you something?

927
01:18:27,215 --> 01:18:32,595
lf you have all that information,
why haven't the police found him for you?

928
01:18:32,887 --> 01:18:36,015
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

929
01:18:36,057 --> 01:18:37,642
They don't think he exists.

930
01:18:38,977 --> 01:18:44,941
You see, l told them what l remembered.
l was asleep. Something woke me up.

931
01:18:48,778 --> 01:18:50,613
(clock ticks)

932
01:18:50,697 --> 01:18:54,367
Her side of the bed was cold.
She'd obviously been gone for a while.

933
01:19:05,336 --> 01:19:06,796
(muffled cry)

934
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,173
(muffled cry)

935
01:19:23,521 --> 01:19:24,898
(muffled cry)

936
01:19:30,737 --> 01:19:31,738
(crash)

937
01:19:52,675 --> 01:19:55,178
There had to be a second man.

938
01:19:55,428 --> 01:19:57,931
Somebody hit me from behind.
l remember.

939
01:19:57,972 --> 01:19:59,682
It's the last thing l do remember.

940
01:19:59,766 --> 01:20:02,394
Look, the police didn't believe me.
lf we check...

941
01:20:02,477 --> 01:20:06,356
How did they explain what you
do remember? The gun and stuff?

942
01:20:09,234 --> 01:20:11,277
John G was clever.

943
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:13,405
He was clever.

944
01:20:13,488 --> 01:20:18,368
He took the dead man's gun and
replaced it with the sap he hit me with.

945
01:20:18,493 --> 01:20:22,622
He left my gun and the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.

946
01:20:22,706 --> 01:20:27,502
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man's hand.

947
01:20:27,585 --> 01:20:29,963
And they only found my gun.

948
01:20:30,046 --> 01:20:32,924
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

949
01:20:33,216 --> 01:20:36,886
l was the only guy who disagreed
with the facts and l had brain damage.

950
01:20:37,345 --> 01:20:39,764
The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

951
01:20:40,515 --> 01:20:44,769
Leonard. You can stay here
for a couple of days if it will help you.

952
01:20:45,353 --> 01:20:47,397
Oh, thanks.

953
01:20:47,564 --> 01:20:52,110
l have to go back to work,
so, um, just make yourself at home.

954
01:20:52,193 --> 01:20:54,612
You can watch TV or have some food.

955
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:57,282
Whatever you want, OK?
Make yourself at home.

956
01:20:57,365 --> 01:20:58,867
One thing.

957
01:21:02,162 --> 01:21:06,875
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.

958
01:21:08,334 --> 01:21:10,420
Natalie.

959
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:38,907
(door opens)

960
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:44,454
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

961
01:21:44,746 --> 01:21:46,873
(phone rings)

962
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:52,295
(phone rings)

963
01:21:54,631 --> 01:21:56,716
(ringing stops)

964
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:31,126
(phone rings)

965
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:36,881
- On the house.
- Thanks.

966
01:22:38,591 --> 01:22:40,009
(laughs)

967
01:22:41,261 --> 01:22:45,098
My, you really do have a problem.
Just like that cop said.

968
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:48,601
- Hm?
- Your condition.

969
01:22:49,352 --> 01:22:51,604
Well, nobody's perfect.

970
01:22:52,397 --> 01:22:56,151
What's the last thing
that you do remember?

971
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,406
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

972
01:23:01,489 --> 01:23:02,365
Dying.

973
01:23:04,284 --> 01:23:06,745
l remember my wife dying.

974
01:23:10,457 --> 01:23:13,293
Let me, um, get you another one.

975
01:23:13,376 --> 01:23:15,336
l think this one's dusty.

976
01:23:19,591 --> 01:23:22,510
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

977
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:26,139
l know you're a cop. What do you want?
Have l done something wrong?

978
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:28,808
l don't know, something bad, maybe.

979
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:32,771
Look, why are you asking me?
l can't remember what I've done.

980
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:34,898
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

981
01:23:34,939 --> 01:23:37,942
Because of my condition, you don't
believe someone with this condition.

982
01:23:38,026 --> 01:23:40,737
Nobody believed Sammy!
l didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

983
01:23:41,488 --> 01:23:43,531
Ferdy's bar.

984
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,244
Come by after. Natalie.

985
01:24:03,176 --> 01:24:05,136
- A beer, please.
- What do you want?

986
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,221
A beer, please.

987
01:24:06,304 --> 01:24:08,682
You can't just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

988
01:24:08,765 --> 01:24:11,101
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

989
01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:14,229
- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that's me.

990
01:24:14,312 --> 01:24:16,981
Yeah, we met before, right?

991
01:24:17,857 --> 01:24:20,110
- Then why am l here?
- l don't know, why don't you tell me?

992
01:24:20,193 --> 01:24:22,237
l don't remember.
l have no short-term memory.

993
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,072
Oh, you're that memory guy.

994
01:24:24,197 --> 01:24:27,951
- How do you know about me?
- My boyfriend told me about you.

995
01:24:28,034 --> 01:24:31,955
- Oh, yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

996
01:24:33,164 --> 01:24:34,541
No.

997
01:24:34,624 --> 01:24:39,963
He knows you. He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.

998
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:43,383
In fact, a cop came by earlier
and was looking for you.

999
01:24:43,466 --> 01:24:45,593
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything,...

1000
01:24:45,677 --> 01:24:47,721
...wouldn't know how he'd got here
or what he'd done.

1001
01:24:47,804 --> 01:24:49,723
l get a lot of guys round here like that.

1002
01:24:49,806 --> 01:24:54,269
Chronic alcoholism
is one cause of short-term memory loss.

1003
01:24:55,937 --> 01:24:59,065
- Are you Teddy?
- No, my name's Leonard.

1004
01:24:59,149 --> 01:25:01,276
- Did Teddy send you?
- l don't know.

1005
01:25:01,901 --> 01:25:03,945
What's happened to Jimmy?

1006
01:25:04,029 --> 01:25:07,741
- l don't know that, either. Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

1007
01:25:07,824 --> 01:25:11,453
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done?

1008
01:25:11,536 --> 01:25:14,956
l can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

1009
01:25:15,081 --> 01:25:17,876
- Then why did you come here?
- l found this in my pocket.

1010
01:25:21,171 --> 01:25:23,298
Your pocket?

1011
01:25:38,438 --> 01:25:39,939
(man hawks)

1012
01:25:47,655 --> 01:25:50,492
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

1013
01:25:50,575 --> 01:25:53,036
- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.

1014
01:25:53,453 --> 01:25:57,374
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

1015
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:04,672
(hawks)

1016
01:26:08,718 --> 01:26:10,512
Thank you.

1017
01:26:27,445 --> 01:26:30,490
- On the house.
- Thanks.

1018
01:26:31,366 --> 01:26:33,410
(man laughs)

1019
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:37,872
It's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

1020
01:26:37,914 --> 01:26:41,626
It's amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

1021
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:44,045
l guess it's poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

1022
01:26:44,129 --> 01:26:48,925
You know the truth about my condition,
officer? You don't know anything.

1023
01:26:49,008 --> 01:26:54,097
You feel angry, you don't know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

1024
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,642
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea ten minutes later.

1025
01:26:57,767 --> 01:27:00,729
Like Sammy.
What if I'd done something like Sammy?

1026
01:27:00,812 --> 01:27:04,733
l didn't tell you?
What happened to Sammy and his wife?

1027
01:27:04,816 --> 01:27:06,985
She came to see me at my office.

1028
01:27:07,068 --> 01:27:11,948
l didn't tell her what l really thought
but l never said that he was faking.

1029
01:27:12,115 --> 01:27:14,325
Just that his condition was mental,
not physical.

1030
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:17,037
l found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.

1031
01:27:18,913 --> 01:27:21,708
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

1032
01:27:37,724 --> 01:27:40,810
She knew beyond a doubt
that he loved her,

1033
01:27:40,894 --> 01:27:43,563
so she found a way to test him.

1034
01:27:55,575 --> 01:27:59,162
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

1035
01:28:00,121 --> 01:28:02,165
Hm.

1036
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:13,218
- She really thought she'd call his bluff.
- There you go.

1037
01:28:13,301 --> 01:28:17,972
Or she just didn't want to live with
the things she'd put him through.

1038
01:28:26,731 --> 01:28:28,108
Sammy?

1039
01:28:30,318 --> 01:28:31,736
It's time for my shot.

1040
01:28:37,909 --> 01:28:39,661
It won't hurt.

1041
01:29:23,496 --> 01:29:26,791
She went into a coma
and never recovered.

1042
01:29:26,916 --> 01:29:30,253
Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.

1043
01:29:30,336 --> 01:29:31,337
Oh!

1044
01:29:32,464 --> 01:29:36,843
He's been in a home ever since.
He doesn't even know his wife is dead.

1045
01:29:36,926 --> 01:29:40,305
l was wrong about Sammy
and l was wrong about his wife.

1046
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:44,517
She wasn't interested in the money.
She needed to understand his problem.

1047
01:29:44,684 --> 01:29:48,396
His brain didn't respond to conditioning
but he wasn't a con man.

1048
01:29:48,438 --> 01:29:51,816
And when she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.

1049
01:29:51,941 --> 01:29:54,027
When l looked into his eyes,
l thought l saw recognition.

1050
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:56,154
Now l know you fake it.

1051
01:29:56,237 --> 01:29:59,324
lf you think you're supposed to recognize
somebody, you pretend to.

1052
01:29:59,407 --> 01:30:02,952
You bluff it to get a pat on the head
from the doctors.

1053
01:30:03,036 --> 01:30:06,122
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1054
01:30:07,874 --> 01:30:09,918
What drug dealer?

1055
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,796
(tires squeal)

1056
01:30:35,527 --> 01:30:38,613
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.

1057
01:30:38,697 --> 01:30:41,700
- It's OK, we know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know l was in here?

1058
01:30:41,783 --> 01:30:43,785
The Jag's out front.

1059
01:30:43,868 --> 01:30:46,871
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

1060
01:30:46,955 --> 01:30:50,500
l guess l wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

1061
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:52,544
- Give me the keys, I'll move it.
- It'll be all right.

1062
01:30:52,627 --> 01:30:54,671
- Wait out there.
- Oh, for Christ...

1063
01:30:54,754 --> 01:30:56,840
Give me a minute,
I've got to get something for you.

1064
01:31:01,511 --> 01:31:05,056
Fact six. Car license SG137IU.

1065
01:31:11,396 --> 01:31:14,524
Look, wait a minute, will ya?

1066
01:31:17,152 --> 01:31:19,404
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

1067
01:31:19,529 --> 01:31:22,449
Oh, man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times l gotta tell you?

1068
01:31:22,532 --> 01:31:25,076
- It's not safe for you to hang around.
- Why not?

1069
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,413
Because that cop's looking for you.
l gotta get you a new identity,...

1070
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:31,875
...some new clothes, a different car
would do for now. Put these on.

1071
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:33,835
Whoa, whoa. What cop?

1072
01:31:33,918 --> 01:31:38,006
He's a bad cop. He's the one
that checked you into the Discount Inn.

1073
01:31:38,089 --> 01:31:42,052
He's been calling you for days, slipping
envelopes under your door, shit like that.

1074
01:31:42,135 --> 01:31:46,139
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He's been laughing at you.

1075
01:31:46,222 --> 01:31:47,682
- You're full of shit.
- No, I'm not.

1076
01:31:47,766 --> 01:31:49,809
He knows you're no good on the phone
so he's been calling you up.

1077
01:31:49,893 --> 01:31:51,853
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

1078
01:31:51,978 --> 01:31:54,731
...so he slips shit under your door
to scare you into answering it,...

1079
01:31:54,856 --> 01:31:59,944
...giving you a line of crap about John G
being a local drug dealer. Jimmy Grants.

1080
01:32:00,153 --> 01:32:02,864
- Who's Jimmy Grants?
- Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1081
01:32:02,947 --> 01:32:06,493
The cop wants to know how his operation
is run. He's got some score in mind.

1082
01:32:06,576 --> 01:32:09,079
- Somehow you're involved.
- How do you know him?

1083
01:32:09,162 --> 01:32:14,834
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

1084
01:32:15,001 --> 01:32:17,295
lf he knew l was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

1085
01:32:17,379 --> 01:32:21,174
So take these clothes, put them on
and get the fuck out of here.

1086
01:32:21,257 --> 01:32:23,134
Come on, Leonard, just go.

1087
01:32:43,446 --> 01:32:45,365
You are full of shit.

1088
01:32:48,201 --> 01:32:50,328
Come by after. Natalie.

1089
01:32:50,954 --> 01:32:52,831
Ferdy's bar.

1090
01:33:33,246 --> 01:33:34,622
(knocks on window)

1091
01:33:34,789 --> 01:33:36,958
Hey, Jimmy.

1092
01:33:38,543 --> 01:33:41,629
I'm sorry, l, uh,
thought you were somebody else.

1093
01:33:42,005 --> 01:33:43,840
Sorry.

1094
01:33:43,923 --> 01:33:45,967
That's OK.

1095
01:33:59,773 --> 01:34:03,818
This Jimmy Grants deals drugs
out of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1096
01:34:04,194 --> 01:34:07,947
But he's not going to bring her along?
He'll come by himself, right?

1097
01:34:07,989 --> 01:34:11,951
l always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

1098
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:15,497
No, officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1099
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:18,541
You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?

1100
01:34:19,793 --> 01:34:20,752
I'll be right there.

1101
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:04,838
Lenny!

1102
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:09,134
Officer Gammell?

1103
01:35:12,137 --> 01:35:14,180
Yeah. Come on.

1104
01:35:30,905 --> 01:35:33,950
- Hey, smile.
- Oh, don't, uh... Not here.

1105
01:35:34,784 --> 01:35:36,786
Over here.

1106
01:35:41,332 --> 01:35:43,960
Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?

1107
01:35:44,044 --> 01:35:47,047
You know what?
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1108
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:49,799
- Why?
- I'm undercover.

1109
01:35:52,427 --> 01:35:55,263
This is the directions, where he's going.

1110
01:35:55,347 --> 01:35:58,224
- My number's on the bottom if you...
- You're not coming?

1111
01:35:58,308 --> 01:36:01,061
Nah, it wouldn't be appropriate.

1112
01:36:04,981 --> 01:36:07,650
Nice picture. l look thin.

1113
01:36:10,445 --> 01:36:11,821
Hey, Lenny!

1114
01:36:13,406 --> 01:36:14,783
Make him beg.

1115
01:37:37,449 --> 01:37:39,492
Teddy!

1116
01:37:41,619 --> 01:37:42,787
Hey, Teddy!

1117
01:37:45,832 --> 01:37:47,709
Teddy!

1118
01:37:50,879 --> 01:37:52,672
Jimmy.

1119
01:37:53,173 --> 01:37:56,426
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

1120
01:37:56,509 --> 01:37:58,470
Expecting any other Jimmies,
memory man?

1121
01:37:58,553 --> 01:38:02,807
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, l remember you.

1122
01:38:02,891 --> 01:38:05,310
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1123
01:38:05,393 --> 01:38:06,478
Well?

1124
01:38:10,148 --> 01:38:12,025
Motherfuck!

1125
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:12,942
What are you doing?

1126
01:38:15,111 --> 01:38:16,363
Strip.

1127
01:38:16,446 --> 01:38:18,907
- You're making a big fucking mistake!
- Strip!

1128
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:23,536
My associates are not the kind of people
you wanna piss off.

1129
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:25,330
Don't say anything else.

1130
01:38:25,372 --> 01:38:28,416
- l knew l couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.

1131
01:38:33,755 --> 01:38:35,799
Your pants, too.

1132
01:38:35,965 --> 01:38:38,343
- Why?
- l don't wanna get blood on them.

1133
01:38:38,468 --> 01:38:42,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!
Did he tell you what l was bringing?

1134
01:38:42,514 --> 01:38:46,518
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got two hundred grand in the car!

1135
01:38:46,601 --> 01:38:49,312
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?

1136
01:38:49,396 --> 01:38:51,690
- Just take the money and walk away.
- l don't want your fucking money.

1137
01:38:51,773 --> 01:38:54,192
Then, what?

1138
01:38:54,275 --> 01:38:57,529
- What do you want from me?
- l want my fucking life back!

1139
01:40:29,037 --> 01:40:30,205
(softly) Sammy.

1140
01:40:37,045 --> 01:40:39,172
He said Sammy.
How does he know about Sammy?

1141
01:40:39,255 --> 01:40:41,299
Oh, fuck.

1142
01:41:01,152 --> 01:41:03,196
What have l done?

1143
01:41:04,531 --> 01:41:05,699
Hey, mister! l need help!

1144
01:41:05,824 --> 01:41:09,327
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.
We gotta get him to a doctor.

1145
01:41:09,411 --> 01:41:10,620
All right.

1146
01:41:11,913 --> 01:41:14,165
l don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.

1147
01:41:14,249 --> 01:41:17,210
- Do l know you?
- No. Don't worry, I'm a cop.

1148
01:41:17,293 --> 01:41:20,588
- Is he still breathing?
- Well, l don't know. Maybe.

1149
01:41:20,672 --> 01:41:25,677
- What the hell were you guys doing?
- l don't remember, l have this condition.

1150
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,763
l hope it's not as serious as his
cos this guy's dead.

1151
01:41:29,222 --> 01:41:33,143
- Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!
- So you remember me now, huh?

1152
01:41:33,184 --> 01:41:37,856
- You are a fucking cop!
- And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

1153
01:41:37,939 --> 01:41:42,360
- Get up! Get up!
- Lenny, you got the wrong idea!

1154
01:41:45,321 --> 01:41:47,407
Who is that? He knew me.

1155
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:50,118
Of course he did, he raped your wife,
he fucked up your brain.

1156
01:41:50,201 --> 01:41:52,245
Bullshit! He's not the guy.

1157
01:41:52,328 --> 01:41:56,166
His name is James F Grants. John G.
Check your tattoos.

1158
01:41:56,291 --> 01:41:59,002
- Why did he bring two hundred grand?
- What?

1159
01:42:01,004 --> 01:42:03,298
- What was it for?
- Amphetamines l told him l had.

1160
01:42:03,381 --> 01:42:06,885
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1161
01:42:07,052 --> 01:42:10,555
Look, Jimmy's your guy. l figured
we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1162
01:42:10,638 --> 01:42:13,516
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn.

1163
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,979
He dealt out of there. The guy at the front
desk let him know if anybody came round.

1164
01:42:18,104 --> 01:42:20,357
He called Jimmy
the minute he saw you taking a picture.

1165
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:22,901
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half.

1166
01:42:22,984 --> 01:42:25,445
He knew about Sammy,
why would l tell him about Sammy?!

1167
01:42:25,528 --> 01:42:28,948
You tell everybody about Sammy!
Everybody who'll listen!

1168
01:42:29,032 --> 01:42:31,159
''Remember Sammy Jankis?''
''Remember Sammy Jankis?''

1169
01:42:31,201 --> 01:42:34,162
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

1170
01:42:34,371 --> 01:42:38,333
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1171
01:42:38,416 --> 01:42:42,295
We all do it. Who cares if there's a few
little details you'd rather not remember?

1172
01:42:43,671 --> 01:42:47,092
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- l don't know.

1173
01:42:47,175 --> 01:42:52,055
Your wife surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.

1174
01:42:52,138 --> 01:42:56,059
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

1175
01:42:57,394 --> 01:42:58,645
The insulin.

1176
01:42:59,896 --> 01:43:02,691
That's Sammy, not me.
l told you about Sammy.

1177
01:43:02,774 --> 01:43:05,819
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1178
01:43:05,902 --> 01:43:09,364
Conditioning yourself to remember,
learning through repetition.

1179
01:43:09,406 --> 01:43:12,283
Sammy let his wife kill herself.
Sammy ended up in an institution.

1180
01:43:12,367 --> 01:43:15,662
Sammy was a con man. A faker.

1181
01:43:15,745 --> 01:43:17,956
l never said that Sammy was faking.

1182
01:43:17,997 --> 01:43:20,875
You exposed him for what he was.
A fraud.

1183
01:43:20,959 --> 01:43:23,002
l was wrong. That's the whole point.

1184
01:43:24,212 --> 01:43:27,424
- See, Sammy's wife came to me...
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

1185
01:43:30,135 --> 01:43:33,013
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1186
01:43:38,893 --> 01:43:39,894
Ouch!

1187
01:43:42,022 --> 01:43:44,190
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1188
01:43:44,899 --> 01:43:46,943
You sure?

1189
01:43:51,448 --> 01:43:53,408
Ouch! Cut it out!

1190
01:43:53,491 --> 01:43:55,535
She wasn't diabetic.

1191
01:43:55,618 --> 01:43:59,330
You think l don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1192
01:43:59,414 --> 01:44:02,542
l guess l can only make you remember
the things you want to be true.

1193
01:44:02,542 --> 01:44:05,295
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

1194
01:44:05,378 --> 01:44:07,547
He was to you.

1195
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:10,967
Come on, you got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

1196
01:44:11,134 --> 01:44:13,636
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

1197
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,847
- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

1198
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:17,724
- Yes, l will.
- No, you won't.

1199
01:44:17,807 --> 01:44:20,185
- Somehow I'll know.
- You won't remember!

1200
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:21,770
When it's done, l will know.

1201
01:44:21,811 --> 01:44:24,939
l thought so, too, l was sure of it,
but you didn't!

1202
01:44:28,568 --> 01:44:33,490
That's right. The real John G.
l helped you find him over a year ago.

1203
01:44:33,615 --> 01:44:36,534
- He's already dead.
- Don't lie to me anymore.

1204
01:44:36,659 --> 01:44:38,703
Look, Lenny,...

1205
01:44:38,787 --> 01:44:41,998
...l was the cop assigned
to your wife's case, l believed you.

1206
01:44:42,082 --> 01:44:44,584
l thought you deserved
a chance for revenge.

1207
01:44:44,709 --> 01:44:48,046
I'm the one that helped you find
the other guy in your bathroom that night.

1208
01:44:48,129 --> 01:44:50,382
The guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

1209
01:44:50,465 --> 01:44:52,884
We found him, you killed him.

1210
01:44:54,594 --> 01:44:56,429
But you didn't remember.

1211
01:44:57,055 --> 01:45:02,185
So l helped you start looking again,
looking for the guy you already killed.

1212
01:45:02,268 --> 01:45:07,023
- Oh, yeah? So who was he?
- Just some guy. Does it matter who?

1213
01:45:07,107 --> 01:45:11,653
No reason, Lenny, no conspiracy,
just bad fucking luck.

1214
01:45:11,945 --> 01:45:15,407
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1215
01:45:17,242 --> 01:45:21,371
But when you killed him
l was so convinced that you'd remember.

1216
01:45:22,163 --> 01:45:24,582
But it didn't stick.

1217
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:26,918
Like nothing ever sticks,
like this won't stick.

1218
01:45:31,172 --> 01:45:33,216
l took that picture.

1219
01:45:33,508 --> 01:45:35,552
Just when you did it.

1220
01:45:38,263 --> 01:45:43,268
Look how happy you are.
l wanted to see that face again.

1221
01:45:43,351 --> 01:45:45,770
- Oh, gee, thanks(!)
- Fuck you.

1222
01:45:45,895 --> 01:45:49,941
l gave you a reason to live
and you were more than happy to help.

1223
01:45:50,025 --> 01:45:55,864
You don't want the truth. You make up
your own truth, like your police file.

1224
01:45:56,573 --> 01:45:59,617
It was complete when l gave it to you.
Who took out the twelve pages?

1225
01:45:59,743 --> 01:46:01,119
You, probably.

1226
01:46:01,161 --> 01:46:03,580
- No, it wasn't me, see, it was you.
- Why would l do that?

1227
01:46:03,663 --> 01:46:06,541
To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1228
01:46:06,624 --> 01:46:08,626
Do you know how many towns,...

1229
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:12,922
...how many John Gs or James Gs?
l mean, shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.

1230
01:46:13,006 --> 01:46:16,259
- Your name's Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

1231
01:46:16,343 --> 01:46:18,386
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1232
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:23,183
Cheer up. There's plenty of John Gs
for us to find.

1233
01:46:26,686 --> 01:46:31,066
All you do is moan! I'm the one
that has to live with what you've done.

1234
01:46:31,149 --> 01:46:33,193
I'm the one that put it all together.

1235
01:46:33,276 --> 01:46:37,947
You, you wander around, you're playing
detective. You're living a dream, kid.

1236
01:46:37,989 --> 01:46:40,992
A dead wife to pine for,
a sense of purpose to your life,...

1237
01:46:41,117 --> 01:46:45,538
...a romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if l wasn't in the picture.

1238
01:46:46,831 --> 01:46:49,959
- l should kill you.
- Quit it! Lenny, come on.

1239
01:46:50,043 --> 01:46:53,088
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1240
01:46:55,215 --> 01:46:57,258
Come on, what are you doing?

1241
01:46:57,342 --> 01:47:01,554
You know what time it is?
It's beer o'clock, I'm buying.

1242
01:47:03,306 --> 01:47:05,350
Fuck!

1243
01:47:14,776 --> 01:47:15,860
I'm not a killer.

1244
01:47:17,195 --> 01:47:20,615
I’m just someone
who wanted to make things right.

1245
01:47:24,911 --> 01:47:28,873
Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?

1246
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:47,434
Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?

1247
01:48:03,074 --> 01:48:07,704
You think I just want another puzzle
to solve? Another John G to look for?

1248
01:48:07,829 --> 01:48:10,123
You're a John G.

1249
01:48:12,584 --> 01:48:14,669
So you can be my John G.

1250
01:48:23,011 --> 01:48:25,889
Do l lie to myself to be happy?

1251
01:48:25,972 --> 01:48:27,307
In your case, Teddy,...

1252
01:48:29,434 --> 01:48:31,478
...yes, l will.

1253
01:48:44,032 --> 01:48:46,034
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1254
01:48:46,117 --> 01:48:49,204
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1255
01:48:49,287 --> 01:48:51,664
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1256
01:48:51,748 --> 01:48:54,084
Somebody'll recognize it.

1257
01:48:55,418 --> 01:48:58,546
You know, l think I'd rather
be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1258
01:48:59,506 --> 01:49:02,050
l might hang on to this for a while.

1259
01:49:02,842 --> 01:49:04,761
Lenny.

1260
01:49:04,803 --> 01:49:07,389
Look, don't...
Will you help me find the keys?

1261
01:49:08,556 --> 01:49:10,558
Help me find my keys!

1262
01:49:10,642 --> 01:49:11,518
Lenny!

1263
01:49:17,857 --> 01:49:18,733
Lenny!

1264
01:49:32,831 --> 01:49:36,209
l have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.

1265
01:49:36,292 --> 01:49:38,336
l have to believe
that my actions still have meaning.

1266
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:41,381
Even if l can't remember them.

1267
01:49:42,132 --> 01:49:47,387
l have to believe that when my eyes
are closed, the world's still here.

1268
01:49:48,596 --> 01:49:51,057
Do l believe the world's still here?

1269
01:49:53,977 --> 01:49:55,520
Is it still out there?

1270
01:49:58,648 --> 01:50:00,400
Yeah.

1271
01:50:02,777 --> 01:50:05,530
We all need memories
to remind ourselves who we are.

1272
01:50:07,907 --> 01:50:09,617
I'm no different.

1273
01:50:12,662 --> 01:50:14,039
(tires screech)

1274
01:50:22,172 --> 01:50:23,840
Now, where was l?

1275
01:50:33,058 --> 01:50:36,144
# We lay in each other's arms

1276
01:50:38,772 --> 01:50:42,025
# But the room is just an empty space

1277
01:50:42,817 --> 01:50:45,362
# l guess we lived it out

1278
01:50:46,571 --> 01:50:49,324
# Something in the air

1279
01:50:50,075 --> 01:50:51,618
# We smile too fast

1280
01:50:51,701 --> 01:50:55,246
# Then can't think of a thing to say

1281
01:50:57,165 --> 01:50:59,751
# Lived with the best times

1282
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:04,464
# Left with the worst

1283
01:51:07,467 --> 01:51:11,179
# I've danced with you too long

1284
01:51:13,765 --> 01:51:15,975
# Nothing left to save

1285
01:51:16,685 --> 01:51:21,564
# There's something in the air

1286
01:51:22,482 --> 01:51:26,361
# Something in my eye

1287
01:51:26,486 --> 01:51:30,615
# I've danced with you too long

1288
01:51:31,825 --> 01:51:33,868
# Yeah

1289
01:51:34,327 --> 01:51:38,248
# Something in the air

1290
01:51:38,873 --> 01:51:43,086
# Something in my eye

1291
01:51:55,181 --> 01:51:57,308
# Abracadoo

1292
01:51:57,517 --> 01:51:59,519
# l lose you

1293
01:52:01,187 --> 01:52:03,857
# We can't avoid the clash

1294
01:52:04,065 --> 01:52:06,109
# The big mistake

1295
01:52:08,111 --> 01:52:10,405
# Now we're gonna pay and pay

1296
01:52:12,532 --> 01:52:17,787
# l guess you know
l never wanted anyone more than you

1297
01:52:19,414 --> 01:52:22,208
# Lived all our best times

1298
01:52:24,794 --> 01:52:27,339
# Left with the worst

1299
01:52:29,924 --> 01:52:33,428
# I've danced with you too long

1300
01:52:36,139 --> 01:52:38,683
# Say what you will

1301
01:52:38,767 --> 01:52:44,356
# But there's something in the air

1302
01:52:46,691 --> 01:52:49,194
# Something in my eye

1303
01:52:49,319 --> 01:52:53,865
# I've danced with you too long

1304
01:52:56,785 --> 01:53:00,205

1305
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:05,335
# There's something in the air

1306
