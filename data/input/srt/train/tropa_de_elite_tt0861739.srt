SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
TAUGHT US AN IMPORTANT LESSON

2
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:09,348
IT'S NOT A PERSON'S CHARACTER
THAT DETERMINES HOW THEY ACT,

3
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:11,217
BUT THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY
FIND THEMSELVES

00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:17,056
(Song) "Dendê's hill is tough to invade"

6
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:20,994
"We'll have a lot of fun if they even try"

7
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:24,731
"I'll tell ya how it is around here"

8
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:28,201
"We make it hard on them, even the DEA"

9
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:31,871
"Even the BOPE shivers when marching uphill"

10
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:35,775
"Cause we give them hell, be the Army, State or Military Police"

11
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,747
"I offer my props to my friends"

12
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:43,450
"Dendê's hill is also land of God."

13
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:45,986
"Have Faith! DJ!"

14
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,108
<i>My city has over 700 slums.</i>

15
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,779
<i>Most of them dominated by
drug dealers, armed to the teeth.</i>

16
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:17,086
<i>They carry AR15,
Pisto-UZI, HK and more...</i>

17
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:21,690
<i>In the rest of the world, these
weapons are used for wars.</i>

18
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,426
<i>In Rio, they're the
weapons for crime.</i>

19
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,636
<i>A 7.62 round can pierce a car
as if it was made of paper.</i>

20
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,905
<i>It's foolish to believe that in
such a city...</i>

21
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,076
<i>...the cops would go to the slums
just to enforce the law.</i>

22
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,214
<i>Cops have their families, too.
They're afraid to die.</i>

23
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:47,785
- So, where to now?
- This way, come on!

24
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:04,035
<i>What happened here
was inevitable.</i>

25
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:08,707
<i>The gangs and the police
had to come to an agreement.</i>

26
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:12,043
<i>After all, nobody wants
to die in vain.</i>

27
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:16,715
The pigs are coming,
Marcinho!

28
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,485
They're here for their pay.

29
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:25,424
Fumaca, give them the money.
You two, cover them!

30
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:33,098
<i>In Rio, peace is based
on a delicate balance...</i>

31
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:36,869
<i>...between the drug lord’s
bullets and policemen's corruption.</i>

32
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:42,041
<i>Honesty is not part
of this game.</i>

33
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:50,150
<i>When honest cops go
to the slums...</i>

34
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:53,219
<i>...terrible things happen.</i>

35
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:19,113
- Are they still inside the car?
- Can you see Fabio?

36
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:27,455
- You won't need your gun!
- You'll leave me unarmed?

37
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:29,524
Get out! Get the fuck out!

38
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,060
- Can you see Fabio?
- Calm down!

39
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,628
Do you see him?

40
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:36,231
- Are you seeing them?
- Calm down!

41
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:41,804
What's up, Oliveira?
Back here again?

42
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,106
Where's our money?

43
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:47,610
Shit!

44
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:50,213
What's going on?

45
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:52,181
Wait!

46
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,183
- Oh fuck...
- Have you seen Fabio?

47
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:56,552
- Calm down, man.
- What? Tell me!

48
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:02,726
<i>In Rio, every policeman
has to choose.</i>

49
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,695
<i>Between being corrupt
and looking the other way.</i>

50
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,631
<i>Or going to war.</i>

51
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,500
<i>That night Neto y Matias
chose the same...</i>

52
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,736
<i>...I did ten years ago.</i>

53
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:14,604
<i>They chose going to war.</i>

54
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,240
Fuck! Who did you
shoot, man?

55
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,308
- Who did you shoot?
- Come on! Move!

56
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:21,846
- Shit! Who's shooting?
- There're two cops!

57
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,182
Shit!

58
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:28,619
They're coming this way!

59
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:40,631
Fuck!

60
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,539
They think they can
mess with us?

61
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,943
Fuck!

62
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:53,178
Run!

63
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:04,290
- Shit!
- We're outnumbered!

64
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:09,796
- Keep shooting!
- We're going to die!

65
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:13,766
<i>Neto and Matias didn't
have any chance.</i>

66
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:18,771
<i>Normal policemen are
not trained for war.</i>

67
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:21,974
I don't have any bullets left!

68
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:32,419
Cool it!
Let's be careful.

69
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:36,023
A lot of people are at that party.

70
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:40,494
We have to be careful.
Maybe there're some policemen.

71
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:43,131
<i>I'm not a regular cop.</i>

72
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:47,135
<i>I'm BOPE, a special squad
in Rio</i>

73
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:51,105
- Who's familiar with Babilonia?
- I am.

74
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:56,244
- Ok, you'll lead us
- We'll go by the main road.

75
00:06:56,377 --> 00:06:59,213
<i>In theory, we're all
part of the police system.</i>

76
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,384
<i>In practice we're
completely different.</i>

77
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,822
<i>Our symbol shows
who we are.</i>

78
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:10,926
<i>Our uniform is not blue,
but black.</i>

79
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,896
Nobody goes in!
None of you!

80
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:17,633
Everybody stays here!

81
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:21,571
<i>BOPE always gets called in when
other forces are in trouble.</i>

82
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:24,907
<i>And this always happens
in Rio.</i>

83
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,411
You think we're stupid
enough to go in?

84
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:36,286
<i>I'm Captain Nascimento.
BOPE's Alpha leader.</i>

85
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:40,356
<i>I'd been at war for a few years.
I was getting tired of it.</i>

86
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:41,357
6 MONTHS BEFORE

87
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:29,241
Honey, I'd like to be home with you,
but I have to work.

88
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,280
Do you hear the heart beating?
Let me listen.

89
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:41,554
It's strong, and very fast.

90
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:46,392
I have to go back to
work, honey.

91
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,397
Don't worry, I'll put it
in the oven.

92
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,098
I love you too.

93
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:04,278
<i>I don't know what I hated most,
the drug lords or the corrupt cops...</i>

94
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,813
How are you, Pompeu?

95
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,382
- Did you bring the guns?
- Yeah.

96
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,918
<i>The police force used to have
around 30.000 men.</i>

97
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:14,289
<i>With those numbers, they
could've ended the drug trade.</i>

98
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,558
<i>But they weren't properly equipped
and their salaries were low.</i>

99
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,528
<i>People like that
didn't care.</i>

100
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,965
I'd love to shoot at them.

101
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:25,666
Which ones Captain?
Just tell me.

102
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,535
Those fucking cops.

103
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:29,938
<i>BOPE only had a hundred men.</i>

104
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:33,375
<i>For each gun that was found,
three more were sold on the streets.</i>

105
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:37,613
14, let them go in.
We'll get them on their way out.

106
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:42,584
If I shoot, I may also
hit the cop.

107
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:46,022
- Both of them?
- Of course.

108
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:49,091
Then, shoot...

109
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:53,863
<i>To me, the ones that helped
the gangs were just as bad.</i>

110
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:14,852
<i>I'll admit it.
I had bad temper.</i>

111
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:23,827
<i>My life was getting more complicated
every day.</i>

112
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:56,095
- Good morning!
- Good morning, honey!

113
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,933
- Let me bring...
- Sit down, I'll take them.

114
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:04,770
No honey, I have to go.
I have to work early.

115
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,474
You just got here and you're
going again?

116
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:15,248
- I didn't have a good night.
- How's the baby?

117
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:20,721
When I worry, he knows and
I don't gain weight.

118
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:25,692
What do you want
me to do?

119
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,532
If I'd known it would be like this,
I wouldn't have gotten pregnant.

120
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,774
Bye!

121
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:43,110
Wait, at least eat a sandwich.
Beto!

122
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:47,582
<i>In war, there's always a
price to be paid.</i>

123
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,687
<i>And when it's too high,
it's time to get out.</i>

124
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:57,325
<i>This is where Neto and Matias
came in the picture.</i>

125
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:01,063
Captain Fabio,
Maintenance Chief.

126
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:04,432
Captain Oliveira,
3rd District Chief.

127
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,737
<i>They started the same war,
in their own districts.</i>

128
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:13,809
<i>I was also impressed
on the first day.</i>

129
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:16,412
Welcome, Lieutenants!

130
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:21,050
From now on,
you're under my orders.

131
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:25,288
Each day, my men and
I will evaluate you.

132
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:31,628
I'm honored to be in front
of these men,

133
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:35,799
who are not only part of one big family,
but are also the very best officers.

134
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:39,869
<i>Neto and Matias believed
everything.</i>

135
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:44,975
<i>They were angels.
But I needed people like them.</i>

136
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:48,112
<i>Actually, I needed
one to have the brains...</i>

137
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:49,914
<i>...and the other one,
the heart.</i>

138
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:55,185
<i>It would've been great to have
both in one person.</i>

139
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:59,390
<i>But who said life was easy?</i>

140
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:01,792
You'll work here, Neto.

141
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:04,595
- Is this the car repair shop?
- Yeah, is that a problem?

142
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:07,498
Can't you put me somewhere else?
I don't know anything about cars!

143
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:10,368
There're 46 cars and 12 motorcycles.

144
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:13,404
We need all of them
to be working.

145
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:18,844
- Captain!
- At ease.

146
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:21,613
These two are your
assistants.

147
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:27,653
- Car 249 will be ready today.
- Finally, Tiao!

148
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,559
Yeah, but we're still waiting for the spare parts.
So I took some parts from this one.

149
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,629
But it's new!
You're going to take it apart?

150
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:42,902
There're some good parts here.
I've already fixed two cars.

151
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:46,606
Whatever, Tiao!
It doesn't matter to me.

152
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,408
This is the rookie.

153
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:51,111
- Sir!
- Lieutenant!

154
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:54,381
- At ease.
- You too.

155
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:58,251
- Have a sandwich, coffee, or water.
- I'm not hungry.

156
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,355
Get to work, I need this
car today.

157
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:05,393
- Without the spare parts?
- I don't care. It has to work.

158
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:08,962
<i>Neto was impulsive,
he acted without thinking.</i>

159
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:12,433
<i>Matias thought too much
before acting.</i>

160
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:19,073
<i>You see these piles of papers?
They're all unsolved crimes.</i>

161
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,776
<i>In Neto's hands,
they would've burned.</i>

162
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:24,446
<i>In Matias' hands, they
are statistics.</i>

163
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,249
This is Lieutenant Matias,
your new boss.

164
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:30,552
- How are you boss!
- Lieutenant, your assistants.

165
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:34,423
Corporal Bruno and Private Machado,
you have to fix the radios.

166
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:37,426
- And organize the files?
- Yes, sir.

167
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,762
- Your desk is over there.
- Sorry, boss.

168
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,732
Let me know if you need anything.
Carry on.

169
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:45,668
<i>Neither one of them
had my expertise.</i>

170
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:49,239
<i>But one of them would have
to replace me.</i>

171
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:51,574
Listen...

172
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,613
<i>Matias was smart and hardworking.</i>

173
00:14:57,713 --> 00:15:01,151
<i>In Brazil, a poor black man doesn't
have many opportunities.</i>

174
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,120
<i>But Matias didn't care about that.
He wanted to be a lawyer.</i>

175
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,558
<i>So he enrolled in Rio's
best law school.</i>

176
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:10,794
Groups of four!
Then, choose one of these.

177
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:13,497
I want you to read Foucault.

178
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,033
We're only three,
we need one more.

179
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,702
<i>It was a privilege for a cop
to belong to the establishment.</i>

180
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:25,476
<i>Matias was very naive. He thought
studying law would help him enforce it.</i>

181
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:30,181
<i>He thought cops and lawyers
had the same mission.</i>

182
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:33,785
I'll hand it in anyway
The professor won't notice.

183
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:38,456
<i>But, to be part of my team,
he would have to be realistic.</i>

184
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,859
- Sociology?
- Yeah, what's your name?

185
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:42,928
- Andre.
- Andre what?

186
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:47,232
- Andre Matias, why?
- You're in our group.

187
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:50,836
I'll explain in a second.
Discipline and Punish by Foucault.

188
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:54,573
Hi, Maria!
Dudu and Roberta.

189
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:57,543
<i>If you're a BOPE officer,
you have to set certain limits.</i>

190
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:06,252
You know the Pope is
coming to Rio?

191
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:08,421
He wants to stay at the
Bishop's house.

192
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:11,190
That's quite close to the
Turano slums.

193
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,361
We have to guarantee him a
peaceful stay.

194
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:18,097
Turano is a war zone!

195
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:20,934
I would pay for him to stay
at the Copacabana Hotel.

196
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,970
I already tried to convince
the governor...

197
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,905
...but not even God can change
the Pope's mind.

198
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:26,740
He'll just stay there for
that night.

199
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,577
He can't hear any gunshots,
we have three months to clean up.

200
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:35,583
- We'll go at night.
- Are you sure?

201
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:40,821
If we go every night,
they'll wait for us and kill us.

202
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:43,758
- There'll be a lot of dead people!
- Nascimento!

203
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:47,462
We'll start tomorrow.
Is that clear?

204
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:49,798
- Yes, sir.
- You may go now.

205
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:59,007
<i>I know it's not the Pope's fault,
but he's already been here twice.</i>

206
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:03,111
<i>Doesn't he know how things
work here?</i>

207
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:07,149
<i>No politician wants the
Pope to get shot in their city.</i>

208
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:09,418
<i>If the Pope wanted to
stay near a slum...</i>

209
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:11,620
<i>What would the governor do?</i>

210
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,924
<i>Would he take that risk?</i>

211
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:18,995
<i>Of course not. He'll call
in BOPE.</i>

212
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:27,970
Stop that Neto.
I'm trying to study.

213
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:32,675
Take a break.
Let's go for a ride.

214
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:34,812
Are you going to use your
car tomorrow?

215
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:38,549
- What do you need it for?
- I'm going to the Prazeres slum.

216
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,250
Are you crazy?
What for?

217
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,854
I'm going to meet my classmates
over there at an NGO.

218
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:48,392
You're a cop, they'll kill you.

219
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:52,263
Calm down Neto
No one knows I'm a cop.

220
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:55,033
Be careful.

221
00:17:57,802 --> 00:18:00,071
<i>The Pope needed BOPE.</i>

222
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,273
<i>BOPE needed me.</i>

223
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:05,377
<i>And I needed to find
a replacement.</i>

224
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:07,346
<i>It wasn't going to
be easy.</i>

225
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:11,283
<i>I'd have to keep visiting
the slums.</i>

226
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:15,420
<i>But I'd go dressed in black
and carrying my gun.</i>

227
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:25,931
<i>I didn't mind that Matias
was studying.</i>

228
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:31,136
<i>The problem was that he didn't
know cops were different.</i>

229
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:34,340
Hi Andre!
I'm glad you came!

230
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:36,742
This is Rose.

231
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,279
And Elena.

232
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:41,915
This one is cuter than
the other guy.

233
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:43,650
You're being very flirty, Rose.

234
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,351
That's why I came here.

235
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:47,988
Don't keep staring, bye!

236
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,793
Sorry I made you come here.

237
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:57,598
This is the office
and this is Rodrigues.

238
00:18:57,831 --> 00:18:59,666
Rodrigues, Andre.

239
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:06,507
He represents the senator that founded
this and he's a good friend of mine.

240
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:10,044
Do you have a candidate?
Now you do!

241
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:14,849
Senator Magalhaes. Number 4-5-1.
Take some to give away.

242
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:19,121
5 minus 4 is 1. 4 plus 1 is 5
Don't forget!

243
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:21,456
<i>It's hard to resist.</i>

244
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:25,693
<i>Who can resist a pretty girl
with good intentions?</i>

245
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,329
<i>Who wouldn't want to
get in her group?</i>

246
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:30,432
Hi Romerito!
This is Andre.

247
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,968
<i>But a cop has to set limits.</i>

248
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:38,106
- Maria, can we go to the arcade?
- Not today, I have to work.

249
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:40,743
- Don't you have homework?
- Yeah, but I'll do it later.

250
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:43,646
But you promised you'd
study!

251
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:46,515
- I know.
- After rehearsal, you'll go home.

252
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,484
- Okay.
- Now, go back to class.

253
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:51,420
- Does he have problems at school?
- He's not doing very well.

254
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,458
- You know why?
- He doesn't like to study.

255
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,159
Maybe it's not that.

256
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,029
<i>I don't know how Matias didn't realize
what he was getting into.</i>

257
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:03,533
<i>You can't be a cop and be
popular at the same time.</i>

258
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:10,407
Foucault believed the power's
structure created the law.

259
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,310
It's not bound by social contract.

260
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:15,279
Understand?

261
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:20,685
Power institutionalizes
the different methods...

262
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:24,021
...that'll be used to discipline
and punish criminals.

263
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:28,293
As they used to do in the
old prisons.

264
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,727
I'm high.

265
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:35,466
Historically, with these institutions
the state could impose...

266
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:39,438
- Here, Andre.
- No, thanks. I don't like it.

267
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,073
- One puff?
- No, thanks.

268
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,909
Give it to me, Roberta.

269
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,713
- It's all I have.
- It's good!

270
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,249
You did a good job!

271
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,253
This project is due
next week.

272
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,790
- Did you do your part, Dudu?
- Of course.

273
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,992
<i>Matias shouldn't have
been there.</i>

274
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:05,064
<i>But since he was there, he should've
arrested them under the 6368 law.</i>

275
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,738
<i>He was just starting his career
and he was already doing wrong.</i>

276
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,275
- Guys!
- What's going on?

277
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:18,812
- I think we did a good job.
- Romerito.

278
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,350
- Weren't you going to study?
- Yeah.

279
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:26,086
- Look, he failed!
- He can't even see the marble.

280
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:30,090
- Let me take you home.
- One second.

281
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:31,892
- Can you lend me your hand?
- What are you doing?

282
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:34,328
I think you're right.

283
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:39,067
He looks to the opposite side.

284
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,137
Let's see how you do.
What letter is this?

285
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:46,374
- It's an "A".
- Good.

286
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:50,412
- Now, what letter is this?
- I don't know.

287
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:53,148
- It's also an "A".
- Really?

288
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:56,751
The boy needs glasses.
Did you notice?

289
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:59,154
Is that why he's doing poorly?

290
00:21:59,154 --> 00:22:02,191
I had the same problem when
I was his age.

291
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:04,393
Let's go tell your mom.

292
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,598
- Come with us, Andre.
- Where? Upstairs?

293
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:12,935
<i>To be a BOPE captain,
Matias would have to act quickly.</i>

294
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:16,139
<i>Just as the gangsters do.</i>

295
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:20,844
They won't make fun of you and
you'll have good grades.

296
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:23,079
Tinho, Bica...
What's up?

297
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,949
- I wrote the test.
- Did you pass?

298
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,587
- Easy.
- You see? Studying helps.

299
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:33,657
Don't worry.
Here, they have social conscience.

300
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:35,326
Relax.

301
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:38,262
- What's happening?
- Bye, Roberta!

302
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:44,635
- Glasses are for nerds.
- Andre uses glasses.

303
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:48,940
- Maria, I have to go.
- Why so early, Andre?

304
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,143
I have to return my
friend's car.

305
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:54,078
That's too bad.

306
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:58,350
I'll take the boy to buy his
glasses another day.

307
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,118
No, Andre, we'll take
care of it.

308
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:04,789
Somebody helped me when I was
a kid, so now I'll do the same.

309
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:09,561
- Ok, I'll see you!
- Bye!

310
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:13,298
<i>No NGO can be run without
the drug lordÂ’s help.</i>

311
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:16,769
<i>This talk about "social conscience"
was just crap.</i>

312
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:20,005
<i>To me, a drug dealer was
a drug dealer.</i>

313
00:23:20,873 --> 00:23:23,742
- What's up, Baiano?
- Hi!

314
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,781
<i>I know how Baiano's story ended,
but not how it started.</i>

315
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:31,517
<i>He probably had a
bad childhood.</i>

316
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:35,855
<i>It's not an excuse, but that's how
most of them become gangsters.</i>

317
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:40,159
- Hey, goldilocks?
- I think it snowed.

318
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,963
- You have the money?
- Here.

319
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:49,103
Xaveco, he gave me two kilos.

320
00:23:49,103 --> 00:23:53,640
<i>The bad thing is that rich kids
also end up as drug dealers.</i>

321
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:02,883
<i>For me, there's no excuse.</i>

322
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:10,025
- Hey, what's new?
- Nothing, just freezing to death.

323
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:13,494
- Bruno! How are you?
- Hi!

324
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,764
- Hey!
- How are you?

325
00:24:21,937 --> 00:24:26,208
- Marcio, I have the good stuff.
- Come in.

326
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,312
Patty, how are you?

327
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:35,918
I'll be back in a minute.

328
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:42,458
Here it is.

329
00:24:44,627 --> 00:24:47,163
- Is this all you have?
- Shit!

330
00:24:47,163 --> 00:24:51,868
- It's hard to get it.
- Next time bring more.

331
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:54,972
There's enough for two kilos.

332
00:24:55,138 --> 00:25:02,179
Get more because people are
getting high like crazy.

333
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:05,716
<i>I always ask myself how
many kids we lose to drugs.</i>

334
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:08,486
<i>So many rich kids dealing drugs.</i>

335
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:13,624
Our goal is to find the weapons,
we'll use channel two.

336
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:17,861
Azevedo's team will go to
the Bishop's house.

337
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:21,299
- Renan's team will go to Tamandare street.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:25,103
Nascimento, do you know
117 street?

339
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,876
Captain Nascimento?
Do you know where it is?

340
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:36,115
I know that street, Captain.

341
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:42,955
It's close to the university
and it's full with students.

342
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:46,125
I already told you this
was a bad idea.

343
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:49,228
Nascimento, these are our orders.

344
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:53,433
We'll reunite at the center
of the slum.

345
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:56,436
- Understood?
- Skulls!

346
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,858
<i>For me, strategy is a good idea
only when it works.</i>

347
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:54,462
<i>But, Operation Holiness
was quite stupid.</i>

348
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:00,636
<i>I couldn't be reckless.
I was going to be a father.</i>

349
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:04,807
<i>I didn't want to die for
no reason.</i>

350
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:56,862
- Get down!
- On the floor!

351
00:27:57,662 --> 00:28:01,399
- Down!
- On the floor!

352
00:28:05,837 --> 00:28:08,039
Are you ok, Captain?

353
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:13,512
- Where's the dealer?
- It's one of them, sir.

354
00:28:14,947 --> 00:28:16,916
Line them up!

355
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:19,585
Quickly!

356
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:27,694
I'm only going to ask
this once!

357
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:30,497
Who's the dealer?

358
00:28:31,431 --> 00:28:33,533
Who is it?

359
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,603
- I'm a student!
- You're what?

360
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:38,538
- A student!
- Just a student?

361
00:28:39,472 --> 00:28:43,343
Ok, come here.
Look at your friend.

362
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:47,648
Look closely.
You see this hole?

363
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:50,283
Who killed him?
Who?

364
00:28:50,283 --> 00:28:53,321
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

365
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:56,757
Tell me!

366
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:58,892
It was one of you!

367
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:02,296
One of us?

368
00:29:03,197 --> 00:29:06,134
You killed him!
Faggot!

369
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:09,337
You finance this shit!

370
00:29:09,337 --> 00:29:12,674
Fucking drug addict!

371
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:17,979
We came here to clean up
your mess.

372
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:23,953
You give them money!

373
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:25,988
Cowards!

374
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:30,626
Who's the dealer?

375
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:36,932
0-7, bring the lookout.

376
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:41,871
Let's see.

377
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,040
Now we'll see.
Tell me!

378
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,311
Come on!
Who is it?

379
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,314
Tell me now!

380
00:29:51,982 --> 00:29:54,250
The one with the jacket?

381
00:29:54,685 --> 00:30:00,023
Take him and the drugs to
headquarters.

382
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:08,065
Captain, are you ok?
Let him go.

383
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,969
Go!

384
00:30:20,912 --> 00:30:26,518
To conclude, we believe the
Brazilian laws...

385
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:30,555
...create a web of power...

386
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:35,728
...that unfortunately,

387
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:40,332
...always end up protecting the rich.

388
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:43,736
Therefore, punishing
the poor.

389
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:46,839
Good!

390
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,309
I think Maria and her group...

391
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:55,048
...showed us that abuse of power...

392
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:58,017
...helps to create bad institutions.

393
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:03,857
Who can give me an example?

394
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:07,461
- Police?
- Ok.

395
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:10,864
Tell us why.

396
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:15,035
Everybody knows the police
go to the slums...

397
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:17,938
...to get money from the people.

398
00:31:17,938 --> 00:31:23,310
So, Edu, the police is against
poor people.

399
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:29,584
And against those who are
forced into committing crime.

400
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:36,858
Professor? I heard what
Edu said, but...

401
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:40,395
I don't think the police targets
only...

402
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:42,664
...poor people.

403
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:47,403
We're also victims.
The middle and upper classes.

404
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:54,076
Once, Maria and I were going to
Buzios, and they stopped us.

405
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:57,746
The policemen were very
aggressive.

406
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,549
Did they beat you?

407
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:04,020
No, they pointed their
guns at us.

408
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:09,392
Settle down!

409
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,462
- Go on.
- My father is a judge.

410
00:32:12,595 --> 00:32:16,233
He says the police go to
the slums...

411
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:20,570
...and kills everybody, just like in the
Candelaria Massacre.

412
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:24,641
They're not only corrupt, but
cowards as well.

413
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:30,047
Calm down!

414
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:34,217
Matias wants to say something.

415
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:40,791
Professor, everybody here has a superficial
idea of what goes on.

416
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:46,164
- They're poorly informed.
- Let him speak!

417
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:51,570
I know there's corruption, but there're
many honest policemen as well.

418
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,740
- Are you crazy?
- You're wrong, Andre.

419
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:06,351
Dudu is right.
Who hasn't been detained?

420
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,756
- It's routine.
- No.

421
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:13,192
They only want our money!

422
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:14,860
I've heard on the news that
in the slums...

423
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,564
...they shoot first and ask
questions later.

424
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:20,600
It's not like that.

425
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,338
Let him finish.

426
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:31,878
I have a friend who's a policeman
and his best friend as well.

427
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,380
They're honest.

428
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,419
I mean, sometimes they have
to be tough.

429
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:41,888
You're crazy!

430
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:47,761
What did you smoke?

431
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:53,034
You have no idea how many kids
die because of drug dealing.

432
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:57,438
You can't see that from your
nice apartments.

433
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:01,843
All you know is what you see
and read from the media.

434
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:10,218
That'll be all for today.

435
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:12,120
Mr. Nascimento?

436
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:18,761
Were you in charge of the
latest operation?

437
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:20,663
Yes.

438
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:28,437
I wanted to ask if you could allow
me to burry my son.

439
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:34,777
Your son was involved
with drugs.

440
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:39,248
Yes, he was the lookout.

441
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:45,755
- We didn't kill him.
- But you let him go, right?

442
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:50,026
Did you think they were
going to forgive him?

443
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:54,098
<i>The gangsters kill those
who make mistakes.</i>

444
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:55,900
<i>And I knew that.</i>

445
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:58,502
<i>That mother made me
feel guilty.</i>

446
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:02,006
<i>And this was dangerous for
a BOPE officer.</i>

447
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,874
Was he your only son?

448
00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:09,146
Yes.

449
00:35:10,915 --> 00:35:13,584
<i>It was time to find my
replacement.</i>

450
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:14,985
- Battery.
- Sure.

451
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:18,789
- And a carburetor.
- Wait, let him finish.

452
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:23,128
Brakes, clutch,
oil filters...

453
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:25,530
...and a broken windshield.

454
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,999
Sir, this one needs a carburetor.

455
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:31,803
- Carburetor, ok
- That's correct, sir.

456
00:35:31,803 --> 00:35:34,906
This car doesn't have a carburetor.
It has an electronic injection.

457
00:35:34,906 --> 00:35:40,079
- Does it have one or not?
- No.

458
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:45,818
- Listen! It has one!
- No.

459
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:49,889
- Are you kidding?
- Of course not.

460
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:54,827
- It has a damn carburetor.
- No.

461
00:35:55,728 --> 00:35:59,699
Look, here it is.

462
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:03,170
He's right, sir.
It has one.

463
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,273
That's because the original
engine was replaced.

464
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:10,477
Everything is loose.

465
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:11,945
What?

466
00:36:11,945 --> 00:36:15,949
Some cop sold the original engine
and replaced it with an old one.

467
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:18,886
- Who?
- I don't know, sir.

468
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:22,223
Forget it.
This happens all the time.

469
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:25,526
The other day, somebody
stole a radio.

470
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:30,431
Are they crazy?
If they steal they can go to jail.

471
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:36,104
- Yes, of course.
- Are you listening to me? Jesus!

472
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:38,740
<i>If the police had any brains...</i>

473
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,877
<i>...they wouldn't have allowed somebody
like Neto to be in charge...</i>

474
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:44,513
<i>Neto was just like me.</i>

475
00:36:44,513 --> 00:36:48,083
<i>When he had a mission,
he'd never quit.</i>

476
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,551
<i>Such bad luck.</i>

477
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:53,155
- I have a problem, sir.
- What is it? I'm in a hurry.

478
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:57,026
A policeman changed the car engine,
right under our noses.

479
00:36:57,026 --> 00:36:59,228
- Do you know who?
- No, but...

480
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:01,864
Ok, rookie. I'll tell the Commander to
open an investigation.

481
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:03,833
- And you'll be in charge.
- Me?

482
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:09,405
But I have to fix these cars,
I need new parts.

483
00:37:09,405 --> 00:37:11,808
Just make sure the Commander's
motorcycle works.

484
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,711
- That's your priority!
- Yes, sir.

485
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:18,582
- Captain.
- What is it?

486
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:21,051
These are the parts that
we're missing.

487
00:37:22,653 --> 00:37:25,722
They're too many!
I'll take a look.

488
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:31,262
Why don't you ask Fabio
for help?

489
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:33,530
- Can't you help me, sir?
- Dismissed!

490
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:40,004
<i>What would the corrupt cops do?
They'd tell him to work the system.</i>

491
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:45,910
Neto, I'll include you,
but don't forget my part.

492
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:50,915
Captain, I need to fix the cars,
I didn't come here to be a mechanic.

493
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:55,687
- Sir, where are we going?
- Follow our damn route.

494
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,892
<i>The first time is always for
a good cause.</i>

495
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:03,929
<i>Once you steal for the police, you're
also going to do it for your family.</i>

496
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:07,600
<i>That's how the system
works.</i>

497
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,470
<i>When citizens ask for a police
car to watch out for their bakery...</i>

498
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,040
<i>...or a bar, they have to pay.</i>

499
00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:18,244
I'm here for my "protection pay"
Are you going to pay today?

500
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:21,114
Yes, Captain.
But I already paid.

501
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:26,285
- You didn't give me anything!
- I already paid Oliveira's men.

502
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:28,555
Oliveira?

503
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:32,659
Sir, If I also have to pay you,
I'll go broke.

504
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:34,728
No, I'll break you.

505
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:37,397
I protect you and you
pay Oliveira?

506
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:40,768
Talk to him, you work together.

507
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:43,738
Let's go, Neto

508
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,706
- How much for the beer?
- It's on the house.

509
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:48,776
No, I want to pay.
Take it.

510
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,849
<i>The policemen ended up
charging for everything.</i>

511
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:59,654
<i>For doing their job
and for looking the other way.</i>

512
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:02,490
That guy is giving tickets
to my customers.

513
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,727
I can't give you new parts
with this.

514
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:09,831
- Who ordered this?
- My parts! I need a battery.

515
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:12,801
Look at him! He's giving tickets.

516
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,537
Come here!

517
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:18,907
- What's wrong Captain?
- Come here.

518
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:25,114
This is my area
Why are you giving tickets?

519
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:28,150
- I'm following orders.
- From whom?

520
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,052
- From Bira.
- Bira?

521
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:35,257
- Bira, come here!
- I can't right now!

522
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:37,126
<i>An example...</i>

523
00:39:37,494 --> 00:39:41,698
<i>The government was so bankrupt,
it couldn't even buy cranes.</i>

524
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:45,168
<i>So they had to rent them from
an independent contractor.</i>

525
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:46,937
Come here!

526
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,272
Wait!

527
00:39:49,372 --> 00:39:52,442
<i>The cranes would give so
much damn profit...</i>

528
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:53,677
<i>...so the system decided
to absorb them.</i>

529
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:57,448
You can't tow away cars here.
I work with him.

530
00:39:57,581 --> 00:40:02,920
Captain, this is Oliveira's man.
Here, we work with him.

531
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:06,257
- And my parts?
- Wait.

532
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,493
Oliveira?
This is Captain Fabio.

533
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,397
I came for some spare parts, but
I learned that this is your area.

534
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:18,102
Commander, it's Fabio.
He's messing with our arrangement.

535
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:20,272
Cut his wings.

536
00:40:20,272 --> 00:40:23,074
Go to hell, Fabio.
This is my area now.

537
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,245
- Your area?
- Yeah, get used to it.

538
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:29,114
Tell him about my parts!

539
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:32,985
Hello? This idiot hung up on me!

540
00:40:33,118 --> 00:40:34,386
And my parts?

541
00:40:34,386 --> 00:40:38,491
Can't you at least get me
a battery?

542
00:40:43,296 --> 00:40:47,600
- Isn't this the Commander's motorcycle?
- He comes for his pay on Fridays.

543
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,371
That's why the motorcycle
always has to work.

544
00:40:51,537 --> 00:40:55,175
- Shit, now I understand!
- Yes, we use it for our payment.

545
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:57,878
Now the Commander wants
it all.

546
00:40:57,878 --> 00:41:03,417
<i>The system was so corrupt, that
everybody was stealing from somebody else.</i>

547
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:11,092
Sergeant, my vacation time
is coming next month.

548
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:16,931
- My wife and I will go away.
- That's nice!

549
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:21,302
I'd like to finish the paperwork,
so I can go.

550
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:27,842
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I have 40 policemen before you.

551
00:41:28,142 --> 00:41:31,479
And our district needs you.

552
00:41:32,047 --> 00:41:37,452
Maybe I can talk to the boss
to see if he'll let you go.

553
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:41,356
- I have to follow procedure.
- But, Sergeant...

554
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,728
I haven't taken vacation
in four years.

555
00:41:45,994 --> 00:41:50,366
- I have to follow rules.
- Maybe I can help you.

556
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:55,838
I want to help you, but you
also have to help me.

557
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:02,746
Corporal Paulo, do you want to be happy?
First, you have to make me happy!

558
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:05,715
Am I right?

559
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:07,851
You have to make me happy.

560
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:09,352
Understood, sir.

561
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:13,723
- Permission to leave, Sergeant.
- Go ahead.

562
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:18,495
This is a serious accusation.

563
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:23,167
- He tried to bribe you.
- Can you prove it?

564
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:28,372
If you can't, they're just rumors.

565
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:34,078
Listen rookie, you do your job
and I'll do mine.

566
00:42:34,078 --> 00:42:35,446
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

567
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:37,515
Dismissed.

568
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:43,388
<i>Neto, wanted to work
for the police.</i>

569
00:42:43,488 --> 00:42:45,223
<i>But he ended just like me.</i>

570
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:47,225
<i>Working against them.</i>

571
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,161
Honey, are you coming upstairs?

572
00:42:51,963 --> 00:42:55,166
Are you ok?
You don't feel well?

573
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,206
Beto!

574
00:43:07,814 --> 00:43:09,281
Beto!

575
00:43:10,316 --> 00:43:12,184
Is everything ok?

576
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,055
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

577
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:29,002
- I can't breathe.
- Calm down, honey.

578
00:43:29,202 --> 00:43:32,673
- My arm is numb.
- It's not your heart.

579
00:43:32,673 --> 00:43:35,142
It's stress, trust me.

580
00:43:41,682 --> 00:43:45,786
- Nascimento, your test results are fine.
- Are you sure?

581
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,523
I have a family history of
heart attacks.

582
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,093
My father died from a
heart attack.

583
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:54,629
Your heart is fine.

584
00:43:55,096 --> 00:44:00,635
Sometimes I feel a buzzing sound in my ear,
and my hands shake as well.

585
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:03,438
Your problem is not physical.

586
00:44:06,308 --> 00:44:10,980
You have too much stress.
I'm referring you to a psychiatrist.

587
00:44:12,714 --> 00:44:15,685
- Psychiatrist?
- It's harmless.

588
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:24,327
<i>When Matias defended them,
he didn't know how rotten they were.</i>

589
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:27,730
<i>He studied the criminal reports
for two months.</i>

590
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:32,268
<i>And he came up with a
plan to place...</i>

591
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:35,671
<i>...police cars in strategic places.</i>

592
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:38,675
<i>But efficiency didn't work
well in this district.</i>

593
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:41,645
<i>Sometimes it seemed stopping
crime...</i>

594
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:47,318
<i>...was the Commander's
least important priority.</i>

595
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:50,787
Shit, Estevao!
This report is going to kill me!

596
00:44:50,787 --> 00:44:54,158
Twelve homicides in one month?
I can't report this.

597
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:58,262
Commander, I checked your report
and I thought it was ok.

598
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:01,432
- You want to ruin me?
- No, sir.

599
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,368
Then, go get Fabio.

600
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,173
And these four dead bodies?

601
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,976
The report was correct.
Didn't you see the graphics?

602
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,745
I don't care about numbers.

603
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:16,814
Now this idiot wants to tell me
where to put patrol cars?

604
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:21,353
<i>When there was a crime in a specific district,
the Commander was responsible for solving it.</i>

605
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,289
<i>But that was a tough job.</i>

606
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:26,959
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes.

607
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:28,393
- Something wrong?
- Yes.

608
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,597
I want you to explain the dead
bodies in Tabajara.

609
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:35,268
It wasn't my fault.
I did everything you told me.

610
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:40,239
No bodies were found in District 19.

611
00:45:40,373 --> 00:45:43,810
This was in District 2, understood?
Yes.

612
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,781
<i>It's easier to change the scene of the crime
than to find the criminal.</i>

613
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:51,184
<i>There were many corrupt commanders
that changed the numbers...</i>

614
00:45:51,184 --> 00:45:53,787
<i>...leaving dead bodies in
other districts.</i>

615
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:56,856
<i>But on some nights, it was just
like the musical chair game.</i>

616
00:45:56,856 --> 00:46:00,360
The bodies are in district 19.

617
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,695
Understood?

618
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:07,935
Sir, I took the bodies
but they returned them...

619
00:46:08,035 --> 00:46:10,470
- I don't want to hear it.
- But, Commander...

620
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,039
- Enough!
- Yes, sir.

621
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:15,175
You have to rewrite the report.

622
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:18,246
Look,
"Body found on the beach"

623
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:21,282
He drowned by the beach,
not our problem.

624
00:46:21,282 --> 00:46:23,919
- But there was a gun wound.
- Are you a judge?

625
00:46:23,919 --> 00:46:26,587
- No, sir.
- I want a new report by Monday.

626
00:46:26,587 --> 00:46:29,925
Because this one never existed.

627
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:38,233
If you don't talk, I can't
help you.

628
00:46:38,233 --> 00:46:39,868
Well...

629
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,272
It's not easy to open up.

630
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:47,877
I don't know...

631
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:53,515
What if you tell my superiors
everything I say?

632
00:46:53,983 --> 00:46:58,120
It's better if you talk to one
of my friends...

633
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:02,459
...who's going to be a father and
has big problems.

634
00:47:02,459 --> 00:47:03,593
Captain...

635
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,865
I can't help you unless you tell
me what your problem is.

636
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:14,404
And this is not a confessionary.
It's the Psychiatric Unit.

637
00:47:15,673 --> 00:47:17,340
Between you and I...

638
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:21,812
...if I had to tell everything...

639
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,516
...there wouldn't be any
policemen in Rio.

640
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,020
So, you decide.

641
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:32,023
Will you tell me or not?

642
00:47:42,934 --> 00:47:44,102
Excuse me.

643
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:48,873
Captain, I'll replace you as
soon as I can.

644
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:53,012
I need you for the Pope
operation.

645
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:59,051
I gave you a task,
so now, go and do it.

646
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:02,054
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

647
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:04,557
Dismissed.

648
00:48:05,057 --> 00:48:07,126
<i>Call it fate, but...</i>

649
00:48:07,192 --> 00:48:10,396
<i>...the same day I had lost
hope of leaving BOPE...</i>

650
00:48:10,396 --> 00:48:15,835
<i>...was the day when Neto
came in with his plan.</i>

651
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:21,107
- Hi Neto!
- Do you have my car keys?

652
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:25,446
What are you doing?
You ruining my map!

653
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:28,382
I found a way to get the
cars fixed.

654
00:48:28,382 --> 00:48:30,417
Let's go, we need to tell Fabio.

655
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:32,786
- What?
- Follow me.

656
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:34,921
You're going crazy!

657
00:48:40,895 --> 00:48:45,299
The Commander is ruining everything.

658
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:46,801
What's that?

659
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:49,971
I'm broke.
He's taking everything.

660
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:54,442
Oliveira is taking everything.

661
00:48:54,842 --> 00:48:56,878
Does this club pay you?

662
00:48:56,878 --> 00:48:59,781
Yeah, so what?
I don't go stealing from the slums.

663
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:03,819
So I can get shot for 500
dollars a month.

664
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:06,622
I can't believe this!

665
00:49:06,755 --> 00:49:10,693
I was good before.
I was honest.

666
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:14,630
But the Commander is taking
everything.

667
00:49:14,763 --> 00:49:18,901
- The gangsters pay him?
- You're so naive.

668
00:49:19,068 --> 00:49:22,738
Haven't you seen his men going
to the slums every week?

669
00:49:22,738 --> 00:49:25,809
They go to collect their money.

670
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,911
How much?

671
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:30,947
At least six a week.
Maybe more.

672
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:35,319
That asshole gets a lot
of money!

673
00:49:35,552 --> 00:49:38,355
I know how we can get
that money.

674
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:41,358
- What do I have to do?
- How?

675
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:44,628
You want to keep the money?

676
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:49,333
No! We'll use the money to
repair the cars.

677
00:49:49,499 --> 00:49:55,339
- Ok, but how much am I getting?
- You want to get back at the Commander?

678
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:58,976
Are you kidding?
You're the ones who want to ruin me.

679
00:49:58,976 --> 00:50:06,517
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Wait a minute, Fabio.

680
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:10,655
Andre, you won't back down
on me.

681
00:50:18,397 --> 00:50:23,769
<i>The timing was perfect.
It took Matias 40 minutes to get...</i>

682
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:26,973
<i>to the Commander's best place.</i>

683
00:50:27,073 --> 00:50:28,207
<i>This is where Neto would
come in.</i>

684
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:32,278
- Try again, see if works.
- Hurry up, I'm late.

685
00:50:32,411 --> 00:50:37,316
- Try again.
- I'm late.

686
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:40,420
You think it's easy?
You fix it.

687
00:50:40,553 --> 00:50:43,390
- I think it'll work.
- Yeah?

688
00:50:46,092 --> 00:50:47,794
It's very late.

689
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:56,569
It'll take some time to fix it.

690
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:59,873
Hurry up and talk to Paulo.
He'll fix it.

691
00:51:00,674 --> 00:51:04,678
<i>By the time he left,
Matias already had the cash.</i>

692
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:07,781
How are you, Santos?
Feeling better?

693
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:09,850
What do you mean?

694
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:13,821
Your friend came and said
you were sick.

695
00:51:14,188 --> 00:51:17,759
- Me?
- Yeah, we gave him the money.

696
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:19,493
Who?

697
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,331
He said the Commander sent him,
so we gave him the money.

698
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:26,100
Son of a bitch!

699
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:28,036
<i>It was a brilliant plan.</i>

700
00:51:29,037 --> 00:51:31,340
<i>What could the Commander do?
Call the police?</i>

701
00:51:33,976 --> 00:51:37,246
<i>Neto worked the system
perfectly.</i>

702
00:51:37,913 --> 00:51:40,950
<i>It was a brilliant plan but
also very risky.</i>

703
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:44,954
<i>The Commander wasn't going
to like this.</i>

704
00:51:45,555 --> 00:51:49,091
<i>At least Neto fought fire
with fire.</i>

705
00:51:49,224 --> 00:51:52,094
<i>Matias kept making the
same mistakes.</i>

706
00:51:52,395 --> 00:51:53,629
There's Andre.
Let's go talk to him.

707
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:56,666
- No, I'm busy.
- Me too.

708
00:51:56,933 --> 00:51:59,302
- See you!
- Bye!

709
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:07,778
- Where've you been hiding?
- Hi!

710
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:40,712
Look who just arrived.
Shit, they're going to arrest us!

711
00:52:42,714 --> 00:52:44,749
What's up guys?

712
00:52:45,217 --> 00:52:47,886
- Mary!
- Maria!

713
00:52:48,486 --> 00:52:51,089
- Everything ok?
- Where were you?

714
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:53,792
We lost track of time.

715
00:52:54,226 --> 00:52:56,462
- You look very pretty.
- You too.

716
00:52:56,995 --> 00:53:00,766
- Who wants to dance?
- We're a bit busy.

717
00:53:00,899 --> 00:53:05,504
- Let's dance.
- Ok, I'll see you later.

718
00:53:09,843 --> 00:53:13,146
Only because we have
nice apartments!

719
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:17,584
Yeah, I'm going with him
for little while.

720
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:20,654
As long as he doesn't end
up messing with us.

721
00:53:52,053 --> 00:53:54,455
I think somebody's messing
with me.

722
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:58,994
It doesn't matter.
Let's keep dancing.

723
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:03,999
<i>They ask you to obey
and respond</i>

724
00:54:04,433 --> 00:54:09,038
<i>They ask for your cooperation
and respect</i>

725
00:54:09,138 --> 00:54:11,373
<i>Police for those who need it</i>

726
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,876
<i>What do you need the
police for?</i>

727
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,112
<i>Police for those who need it</i>

728
00:54:16,112 --> 00:54:18,815
<i>What do you need the
police for?</i>

729
00:54:19,516 --> 00:54:21,751
Too much salt,
you have to put potatoes.

730
00:54:23,586 --> 00:54:25,455
<i>When the Commander heard he'd
been robbed, he couldn't complain.</i>

731
00:54:25,455 --> 00:54:28,425
<i>So he used this situation
to get revenge.</i>

732
00:54:28,425 --> 00:54:31,728
The Cornell couldn't complain.

733
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,564
<i>He placed Matias as a cook.</i>

734
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:37,534
Neto got stuck in the
repair shop.

735
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:39,670
What are you doing here,
Paulo?

736
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:43,340
They cancelled my vacations,
so I wouldn't complain.

737
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,042
And the shop?

738
00:54:46,043 --> 00:54:47,244
<i>But without their best mechanic.</i>

739
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:49,447
Guava jam?

740
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:53,184
Neto, I told you this wouldn't
end well.

741
00:54:54,185 --> 00:54:57,421
<i>The Commander was sure you
were following orders.</i>

742
00:54:57,421 --> 00:55:01,660
<i>From somebody high up who knew
the system quite well.</i>

743
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:02,761
Fabio!

744
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:04,596
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

745
00:55:04,896 --> 00:55:06,831
- Are you working tonight?
- Yes, sir.

746
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:10,502
I want you to watch
the party at Babilonia.

747
00:55:10,502 --> 00:55:12,070
- Me?
- Yes, you.

748
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,105
- Yes, sir.
- Tonight.

749
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:16,408
- Tonight?
- Yes, sir.

750
00:55:16,575 --> 00:55:19,812
<i>The Commander would punish
him the most...</i>

751
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,950
<i>...otherwise, the story of Neto and Matias
would've been quite different.</i>

752
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:28,788
Honey, it's moving!

753
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:32,525
It's the most beautiful
thing I've seen.

754
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:35,228
Too bad you're not here.

755
00:55:35,495 --> 00:55:38,164
I want you to hear the
heart beat.

756
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:49,710
<i>Every time I thought of my son,
it would remind me of that kid's mother.</i>

757
00:55:49,876 --> 00:55:53,547
<i>Must be really hard not being
able to burry your own son.</i>

758
00:56:07,695 --> 00:56:10,765
Get dressed! We're leaving!

759
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:15,269
- Where are we going, Captain?
- To Turano.

760
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:17,104
We're going to find
that kid's body.

761
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:27,282
The Cornell asked me to do this.

762
00:56:27,382 --> 00:56:29,351
If we do a good job, we'll get
lots of money.

763
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:32,054
Don't tell the rookie, otherwise
he'll rob us.

764
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:36,324
What are you doing
with this rifle?

765
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,361
You think you're going to
the slum with me?

766
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,997
- You stay here, I'm in charge.
- Ok, no problem.

767
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,134
Captain, the brigade will
go with Cabral.

768
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,071
- The Commander told me to stay.
- No, you come with me.

769
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:51,274
Rookie, put down that rifle and go fix
the Commander's motorcycle.

770
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:53,076
Let's go, Fabio. Hurry up.

771
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,313
Neto, did you do what
we said?

772
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,550
- Yeah, why?
- Captain, let's go!

773
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,652
I'm coming.

774
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,623
I think they'll kill me.

775
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:22,507
- Matias.
- What's wrong?

776
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:24,742
- They already found out.
- What happened?

777
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:26,911
They think Fabio did it.

778
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:29,647
- What do we do?
- Come with me.

779
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:31,883
- You're in charge, Paulo.
- But, Lieutenant.

780
00:58:20,433 --> 00:58:21,501
Get down!

781
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:23,303
- Do you see Fabio?
- Relax.

782
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:25,539
- What's going on?
- Calm down!

783
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:26,807
What's going on?

784
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:29,643
- You won't need this.
- You'll leave me unarmed?

785
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,812
Get out!

786
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:34,248
- Where's Fabio?
- Relax, I'll find him.

787
00:58:34,248 --> 00:58:37,518
- You see him?
- Shut up!

788
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:43,825
What's up, Oliveira?
Back here again?

789
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:45,960
Where's our money?

790
00:58:46,094 --> 00:58:49,764
<i>They weren't going to shoot Fabio
in front of everybody.</i>

791
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:53,134
<i>But Neto saw the gangster
reaching for his gun.</i>

792
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:59,408
<i>Neto had a very restless finger, and he
thought the guy was going to grab his gun.</i>

793
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:04,714
- Who did you shoot?
- Let's go.

794
00:59:04,814 --> 00:59:05,514
Fuck!

795
00:59:12,822 --> 00:59:14,990
What the hell ?

796
00:59:49,193 --> 00:59:51,896
Fuck! They've gone crazy!
They're shooting at each other!

797
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:58,603
Cover me!

798
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:00,472
Do something.

799
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:05,343
I'm running out of bullets.
I just have one left.

800
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,182
Shit, the answering machine.

801
01:00:10,182 --> 01:00:13,586
- Leave the message.
- Fucking idiot!

802
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:20,959
If Cabral gets promoted...

803
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:25,030
...that's one more district which would
mean even more money.

804
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:28,301
- How much more?
- Excuse me.

805
01:00:30,303 --> 01:00:32,205
<i>Commander, we need help!
We're outnumbered!</i>

806
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:34,007
<i>Call BOPE!</i>

807
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,442
- Captain!
- What's wrong?

808
01:00:36,442 --> 01:00:39,813
The police is getting hit at
Babilonia, they already killed one.

809
01:00:39,813 --> 01:00:42,281
There's nobody.
They're all busy.

810
01:00:42,281 --> 01:00:44,251
- What do I do?
- God!

811
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:02,603
Son, I'm no rush.
I can stay all night.

812
01:01:03,237 --> 01:01:06,140
- Where's the lookout?
- I don't know!

813
01:01:06,474 --> 01:01:10,278
You're in charge and you
don't know?

814
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:13,281
I'm not a dealer, boss.
I don't know.

815
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:15,650
We'll have to put on the
bag again.

816
01:01:25,293 --> 01:01:28,530
- It's cold Captain.
- Throw water on his face.

817
01:01:28,964 --> 01:01:30,866
Wake up, you idiot!

818
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:34,570
0-1, Babilonia is priority.
The police is outnumbered.

819
01:01:36,672 --> 01:01:38,875
Understood, Carvalho.
We're on our way.

820
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:42,244
We'll go clean up your shit.
We'll go to Babilonia.

821
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:45,548
- What about him?
- Charge him on the Pope operation.

822
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,694
Shoot!
Keep shooting!

823
01:01:58,161 --> 01:02:00,263
We're going to die!

824
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:05,068
- Shoot them!
- They're lost!

825
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:10,374
They're shooting at us
from below.

826
01:02:10,374 --> 01:02:13,277
They can't get us from there.
Lower, Matias.

827
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:17,748
Shoot, you idiot!

828
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:26,691
- BOPE is here
- Everybody stay here!

829
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:29,661
Stay here!

830
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:39,738
- We're going to die, Neto.
- Shoot them!

831
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:43,308
- I don't have any more bullets!
- Then, stay down.

832
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:46,645
Shoot!
Shoot, Careca!

833
01:02:47,612 --> 01:02:49,014
Fuck!

834
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:24,585
Shit!

835
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,720
They're coming towards us.

836
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:37,331
- Get down! Throw your gun!
- I'm a cop.

837
01:03:37,331 --> 01:03:41,002
- We're policemen!
- Throw your guns!

838
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:45,207
- It's just you two?
- Yeah.

839
01:03:45,207 --> 01:03:48,310
Come here, sit down.

840
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:51,279
Check the perimeter.

841
01:03:52,147 --> 01:03:54,883
0-1, they're only two.

842
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,155
Bocao, check who we have.

843
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:03,559
- Marcinho, the drug czar.
- We have to take him.

844
01:04:03,726 --> 01:04:05,594
- Are you ok?
- Yes, sir.

845
01:04:05,594 --> 01:04:07,763
- Are you hurt?
- No, sir.

846
01:04:07,763 --> 01:04:09,966
- Were you hit?
- No, sir.

847
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:12,301
Tonight you'll learn to
carry corpses.

848
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:13,669
Yes, sir.

849
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:16,873
- What are you waiting for?
- Nothing, sir.

850
01:04:18,274 --> 01:04:20,376
- Grab him.
- Lift him up.

851
01:04:20,376 --> 01:04:22,278
Wait.

852
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,614
Hi, honey.

853
01:04:25,114 --> 01:04:27,083
Did your water break?

854
01:04:27,617 --> 01:04:29,052
Are you sure?

855
01:04:29,153 --> 01:04:31,855
Calm down, remember what
the doctor said?

856
01:04:31,855 --> 01:04:37,828
Don't rush, I'm on my way.

857
01:04:38,562 --> 01:04:40,330
- 0-2.
- Sir?

858
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:45,570
You're in charge, let's just take this body.
I'm going to have a son!

859
01:04:47,037 --> 01:04:49,139
Congratulations, Captain!

860
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,709
Quick!

861
01:05:00,786 --> 01:05:03,789
God, this is a heavy one!

862
01:05:12,097 --> 01:05:15,000
If you hadn't shown up, I would've
been killed.

863
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,570
- BOPE brought your gun.
- Help us with the body.

864
01:05:18,905 --> 01:05:21,207
Let us through!

865
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:25,878
Get the fuck out of
here!

866
01:05:29,115 --> 01:05:31,384
- Sergeant?
- What is it Lieutenant?

867
01:05:31,384 --> 01:05:34,387
How can I join BOPE?

868
01:05:34,387 --> 01:05:36,889
- You have to be selected.
- How?

869
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:39,592
Check the bulletin at the
police station.

870
01:05:40,928 --> 01:05:42,595
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

871
01:05:55,509 --> 01:05:57,878
Look at this, Carvalho.

872
01:05:57,878 --> 01:05:59,247
- Commander.
- At ease.

873
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:01,815
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

874
01:06:02,116 --> 01:06:05,787
Tell me, boy or girl?

875
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,689
Boy, Rafael.

876
01:06:07,989 --> 01:06:11,192
- What's this, Renan?
- Conjunctivitis.

877
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,529
- It looks awful.
- Put on your glasses.

878
01:06:14,996 --> 01:06:17,866
Listen, this is a gift...

879
01:06:18,567 --> 01:06:21,403
...not for you.
For your son.

880
01:06:21,403 --> 01:06:25,240
It's time to pick your replacements.

881
01:06:27,509 --> 01:06:28,911
Ok!

882
01:06:29,044 --> 01:06:33,583
This will be BOPE's best
training camp.

883
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:34,617
I'm sure it will be.

884
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:37,353
Let's start,
number one, here.

885
01:06:37,353 --> 01:06:40,923
- Yes, Andre Pedrosa.
- He receives payments.

886
01:06:40,923 --> 01:06:42,225
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

887
01:06:42,225 --> 01:06:45,395
He's fucked.
He won't make it.

888
01:06:45,395 --> 01:06:48,598
Commander, I also know Olavo.

889
01:06:48,698 --> 01:06:49,966
He's as dirty as the
rest of them.

890
01:06:49,966 --> 01:06:52,302
What about Fabio?
I've heard of him.

891
01:06:52,302 --> 01:06:54,571
Let's skip Fabio.
I've already heard of him.

892
01:06:54,571 --> 01:06:55,539
He's Captain, isn't he?

893
01:06:55,539 --> 01:06:57,841
- Fabio Barbosa.
- He's heavy duty.

894
01:06:57,841 --> 01:07:00,344
He's been a pimp in Copacabana.

895
01:07:00,344 --> 01:07:02,112
- I'll take care of him.
- Renan?

896
01:07:02,112 --> 01:07:05,082
- Can you see?
- Yes, sir.

897
01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:08,652
The guy looks like Batman.

898
01:07:09,954 --> 01:07:11,488
Renan, where are the
two rookies?

899
01:07:11,488 --> 01:07:15,960
The ones you rescued?
I think they're ok.

900
01:07:16,628 --> 01:07:19,096
- Let's see what they have.
- Listen.

901
01:07:19,096 --> 01:07:23,301
I don't want hear of a
busted eardrum.

902
01:07:23,301 --> 01:07:26,438
Or of some fingercuts.
Is that clear?

903
01:07:26,438 --> 01:07:29,174
The guy's hand was an accident.

904
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:33,045
He grabbed the sable at
the wrong time.

905
01:07:33,045 --> 01:07:37,249
- And the eardrum, Carvalho...
- It was an accident, Commander.

906
01:07:37,783 --> 01:07:40,085
An accident?

907
01:07:40,418 --> 01:07:43,822
He deserved it, Commander.

908
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:50,663
<i>A BOPE officer could not go out
with a friend of a drug dealer.</i>

909
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:54,033
<i>Matias was confused.</i>

910
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:58,404
<i>He wanted to be a cop, but he also
wanted to be a lawyer.</i>

911
01:08:00,139 --> 01:08:04,878
<i>If Matias was a true policeman,
he would've told his girlfriend.</i>

912
01:08:05,244 --> 01:08:09,015
<i>But he made up a trip and asked
her for help getting a practicum.</i>

913
01:08:09,015 --> 01:08:11,918
He's been working with us
for almost a year.

914
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:15,622
He's done very well,
he solved all our problems.

915
01:08:16,123 --> 01:08:18,392
Ok, listen...

916
01:08:18,592 --> 01:08:23,263
He's away right now, could you do
the interview in two weeks?

917
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:26,501
Ok, great!

918
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:30,871
<i>I was sure Matias would quit...</i>

919
01:08:30,871 --> 01:08:33,007
<i>...halfway during training camp.</i>

920
01:08:33,007 --> 01:08:34,942
I got Matias a practicum!

921
01:08:34,942 --> 01:08:37,378
It's best you get another
boyfriend.

922
01:08:37,378 --> 01:08:41,049
What happened?
Is everything ok, Baiano?

923
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:44,285
You tell me.

924
01:08:46,087 --> 01:08:48,490
Do you recognize anybody
in this picture?

925
01:08:51,159 --> 01:08:53,329
You don't recognize this
piece of shit?

926
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,697
- It can't be him, Baiano.
- It can't be him!

927
01:08:55,697 --> 01:09:01,103
He killed a friend of mine.
He killed one of us.

928
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:03,305
- What will happen now?
- Calm down.

929
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,942
Look Baiano, we have nothing
to do with this.

930
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:08,945
- I brought Matias.
- Maria didn't know he was a cop.

931
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:10,680
- I just found out now.
- We didn't know.

932
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:15,084
Don't fuck with me!

933
01:09:16,353 --> 01:09:21,558
Let me tell you something,
these pigs are our enemies.

934
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:24,494
- Nobody knew.
- Shut up! I'm not finished.

935
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:28,098
Who do you think protects the slums?
The police?

936
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:30,400
Answer!

937
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,170
- The command.
- That's right, bitch.

938
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:36,139
And I'm the boss.

939
01:09:36,274 --> 01:09:38,075
If you want to be here, you
need my blessing.

940
01:09:38,075 --> 01:09:39,777
- We know.
- Which side are you on, pretty boy?

941
01:09:39,777 --> 01:09:41,679
- Pretty boy?
- With you!

942
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,581
- We're all in this together!
- That's right, together!

943
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:45,049
It's us, Baiano.

944
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:47,819
I'll make you pay for this.

945
01:09:48,152 --> 01:09:49,721
- Let's go.
- Shut up!

946
01:09:49,721 --> 01:09:53,692
- Calm down!
- Xaveco, burn it.

947
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:55,960
- What's this?
- Son of a bitch!

948
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:01,132
You have to be honest with me.
If not, there'll be trouble.

949
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,702
Keep the paper.

950
01:10:04,803 --> 01:10:06,371
Let's go.

951
01:10:13,045 --> 01:10:16,048
<i>Neto signed up because
he liked war.</i>

952
01:10:16,549 --> 01:10:19,985
<i>Matias did it because he
believed in the law.</i>

953
01:10:20,252 --> 01:10:22,121
<i>And the corrupt policeman?</i>

954
01:10:22,222 --> 01:10:25,758
<i>Fabio was running away from the Commander.
Poor bastard!</i>

955
01:10:25,858 --> 01:10:31,231
<i>He didn't know that I would
be much worse.</i>

956
01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:37,337
JULY 1997
TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE POPE'S VISIT

957
01:10:37,337 --> 01:10:41,007
You're here on your
own free will.

958
01:10:41,808 --> 01:10:42,976
Nobody...

959
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:47,881
...forced you to come here.

960
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:53,087
You're not welcomed here.

961
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:56,623
Prepare your souls...

962
01:10:57,358 --> 01:11:01,028
...because your bodies belong
to us now.

963
01:11:02,397 --> 01:11:08,470
I now declare the beginning of
the BOPE training camp.

964
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,338
You'll never survive.

965
01:11:18,246 --> 01:11:20,683
Skulls, forward.

966
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:26,789
Idiots!
Sick bastards!

967
01:11:26,955 --> 01:11:31,094
<i>Some people see BOPE
as a cult.</i>

968
01:11:31,094 --> 01:11:32,761
<i>But, it has to be that way.</i>

969
01:11:32,761 --> 01:11:35,731
- Ask me to leave! Beg me!
- No, sir!

970
01:11:38,234 --> 01:11:41,537
<i>We would train our men to resist
pain and humiliation.</i>

971
01:11:41,537 --> 01:11:45,108
<i>To get in, they'd have to prove
they could handle pressure.</i>

972
01:11:46,209 --> 01:11:48,244
- Go back where you came from.
- No, sir.

973
01:11:48,244 --> 01:11:52,549
- Go back to your district.
- No, sir.

974
01:11:56,053 --> 01:11:59,489
You think nobody knows that
gangs pay you?

975
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:03,427
That you get money from
the dealers?

976
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,930
You know why your number
is 0-1?

977
01:12:06,096 --> 01:12:08,666
Because you'll be the first
one to quit.

978
01:12:08,666 --> 01:12:11,268
I'll make you quit!

979
01:12:11,268 --> 01:12:16,207
- Ask me to leave!
- No, sir.

980
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,276
If you don't do it, we'll
crush you.

981
01:12:18,276 --> 01:12:21,712
- Beg, you idiot!
- Ok, I give up!

982
01:12:21,847 --> 01:12:26,985
- 0-1 gave up.
- Skulls.

983
01:12:27,118 --> 01:12:30,689
<i>Of 100 policemen, 5 would stay.</i>

984
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:34,760
<i>When I got in, only three
of us passed.</i>

985
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,729
<i>Not even the Israeli army
trained like us.</i>

986
01:12:37,763 --> 01:12:40,566
<i>The BOPE soldiers killed
guerrillas.</i>

987
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:44,370
<i>With knives in our mouth,
we would scalp them.</i>

988
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:48,608
<i>And we would
kill them with rifles.</i>

989
01:12:48,608 --> 01:12:51,744
<i>The BOPE soldiers defend
Brazil's honor.</i>

990
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,014
<i>To fight against drugs...</i>

991
01:12:55,014 --> 01:12:57,817
<i>...you'd have to be willing to
risk everything.</i>

992
01:13:00,653 --> 01:13:02,855
The concept of strategy...

993
01:13:03,756 --> 01:13:06,293
...comes from the Greek
"strategia".

994
01:13:07,828 --> 01:13:10,197
In Latin.

995
01:13:12,132 --> 01:13:14,768
In French.

996
01:13:15,836 --> 01:13:18,138
- Are you writing this down?
- Yes, sir.

997
01:13:18,138 --> 01:13:20,474
It'll be on the exam.

998
01:13:20,774 --> 01:13:23,211
In English.

999
01:13:24,578 --> 01:13:27,148
In German.

1000
01:13:28,817 --> 01:13:31,786
In Italian.

1001
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:36,725
In Spanish.

1002
01:13:36,925 --> 01:13:38,159
Coordinator.

1003
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,629
- What is it?
- 0-5 fell asleep.

1004
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:46,335
- 0-5.
- Yes, sir.

1005
01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:48,403
Take this, please.

1006
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,478
0-5, if you drop that grenade,
you'll kill us all.

1007
01:13:56,979 --> 01:14:01,116
You'll blow up your classmates
and my assistants.

1008
01:14:01,116 --> 01:14:03,519
And you'll kill me, too.

1009
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:06,389
- Are you going to fall asleep?
- No, sir.

1010
01:14:06,556 --> 01:14:09,159
We're counting on you, sir.

1011
01:14:12,428 --> 01:14:13,629
Now...

1012
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:18,935
...I'll continue.

1013
01:14:21,472 --> 01:14:23,407
The concept of strategy.

1014
01:14:24,775 --> 01:14:28,078
In Greek.

1015
01:14:30,481 --> 01:14:32,116
In Latin.

1016
01:14:35,186 --> 01:14:36,888
In French.

1017
01:14:37,254 --> 01:14:39,556
- Team leader!
- Yes, sir.

1018
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:42,259
- Are you ready to eat?
- Yes, sir.

1019
01:14:42,259 --> 01:14:46,898
- How much time do you need?
- 10 minutes, sir.

1020
01:14:47,299 --> 01:14:49,934
You're kidding!

1021
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:52,970
Team leader, you're a fool.

1022
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:57,075
You all have ten seconds
for eating.

1023
01:14:57,175 --> 01:14:59,978
Don't touch the food
until I say so.

1024
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:09,355
When you're done, I want to see
the ground clean.

1025
01:15:09,455 --> 01:15:11,524
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,793
- Now, go!
- Fast!

1027
01:15:15,961 --> 01:15:21,034
- Three seconds have gone by.
- 0-2, you're not eating.

1028
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:24,904
- Time's up.
- Finished.

1029
01:15:29,776 --> 01:15:32,912
What is this food doing
here?

1030
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,514
We didn't have time, sir.

1031
01:15:34,514 --> 01:15:37,051
0-6, do you think it's fair,
in a country like Brazil...

1032
01:15:37,051 --> 01:15:39,786
...where people are starving
to death...

1033
01:15:39,886 --> 01:15:44,224
...to leave food on the ground
because it looks gross?

1034
01:15:44,324 --> 01:15:47,795
- No, sir.
- Why didn't you eat, 0-2?

1035
01:15:47,895 --> 01:15:52,800
- I couldn't get to it, sir.
- And now, 0-2?

1036
01:15:53,167 --> 01:15:54,101
Yes, sir.

1037
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:57,272
So, get on your knees
and eat it now!

1038
01:16:00,408 --> 01:16:03,644
I want you to eat
everything, 0-2.

1039
01:16:03,979 --> 01:16:05,480
- No bullshit!
- Yes, sir.

1040
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,684
If you don't eat it all,
everybody will stay up all night...

1041
01:16:08,684 --> 01:16:11,019
...in the water, 0-2.

1042
01:16:13,655 --> 01:16:15,791
Are you feeling sick, 0-2?

1043
01:16:15,924 --> 01:16:19,528
0-2, if you vomit on your
classmates' food...

1044
01:16:19,528 --> 01:16:23,499
...they'll have to eat your
vomit.

1045
01:16:23,499 --> 01:16:28,170
- Sir, I'll eat it.
- Everybody eat! Now!

1046
01:16:28,537 --> 01:16:30,606
- Fast!
- Eat!

1047
01:16:32,474 --> 01:16:34,110
It's 0-2's fault!

1048
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:36,546
I want the ground to
be clean.

1049
01:16:38,014 --> 01:16:40,617
<i>Men in black, what is
your mission?</i>

1050
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:43,553
<i>Take away the devil that
dresses in blue.</i>

1051
01:16:43,553 --> 01:16:46,023
<i>Men in black, what is
your mission?</i>

1052
01:16:46,023 --> 01:16:49,026
<i>Go to the slums and take
those people...</i>

1053
01:16:49,026 --> 01:16:52,262
Stop singing!

1054
01:16:52,562 --> 01:16:54,031
Leader...

1055
01:16:54,197 --> 01:16:57,835
...this is the worst group I've
seen in my life.

1056
01:16:58,001 --> 01:17:02,940
Go on.
Stop singing but not marching.

1057
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,709
Out of the water, now!

1058
01:17:05,809 --> 01:17:08,379
<i>The first stage in the
course was hard.</i>

1059
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:12,884
<i>The idea is, to first get rid of the
weak, and then the corrupt.</i>

1060
01:17:13,351 --> 01:17:16,588
<i>Me? I'd prefer to get rid of
the corrupt first.</i>

1061
01:17:16,688 --> 01:17:20,492
- 14, lend him your ointment.
- I don't have any left.

1062
01:17:21,693 --> 01:17:26,030
- Wake up 0-2!
- No, let me sleep!

1063
01:17:26,131 --> 01:17:28,600
- Take off those boots.
- I can't.

1064
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:31,470
If I do, I won't be able to put
them back on.

1065
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:34,840
- Take them off!
- Wet feet will make you sick.

1066
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:37,342
Your feet are in bad shape.
Take them off.

1067
01:17:37,342 --> 01:17:39,178
Attention, 0-2!

1068
01:17:40,312 --> 01:17:43,248
- I have news for you.
- Yes, sir.

1069
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,785
You're the new leader.

1070
01:17:46,919 --> 01:17:51,224
You have one minute to line
up your unit.

1071
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:53,859
- Yes, sir.
- Quick!

1072
01:18:01,034 --> 01:18:03,870
Line up, you idiots!

1073
01:18:03,904 --> 01:18:07,173
- 23, fast!
- 20 seconds, 0-2.

1074
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,276
- 20 seconds!
- Yes, sir.

1075
01:18:09,276 --> 01:18:10,577
- Are they lined up?
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:18:10,577 --> 01:18:12,146
Look back there.

1077
01:18:12,246 --> 01:18:15,549
- Is this a formation?
- Attention, brigade!

1078
01:18:16,117 --> 01:18:17,351
The brigade is lined up.

1079
01:18:17,351 --> 01:18:18,719
- Is this a formation?
- Yes, sir.

1080
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,654
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1081
01:18:20,788 --> 01:18:23,758
Look at your shoelaces!

1082
01:18:23,925 --> 01:18:26,393
You animal!

1083
01:18:30,465 --> 01:18:32,534
- 0-2, follow me!
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,503
Move!

1085
01:18:36,438 --> 01:18:38,140
- 0-2.
- Yes, sir.

1086
01:18:38,273 --> 01:18:40,142
- You see that boat?
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:18:40,142 --> 01:18:43,812
You see?
Since your shoelaces are loose...

1088
01:18:43,812 --> 01:18:47,182
- Why don't you go barefooted and bring it here?
- Yes, sir.

1089
01:18:48,484 --> 01:18:51,587
- You think you can do it?
- Yes, sir.

1090
01:18:52,821 --> 01:18:54,022
0-2.

1091
01:18:54,557 --> 01:18:56,925
You know why you can't do
what I ordered you?

1092
01:18:56,925 --> 01:19:00,196
- Sir?
- It's not because you're weak.

1093
01:19:01,097 --> 01:19:05,001
It's because you need to
have heart, 0-2.

1094
01:19:05,068 --> 01:19:07,203
You have to have integrity.

1095
01:19:07,771 --> 01:19:09,939
Something you don't have.

1096
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:14,010
You should be with your whores,
with pimps.

1097
01:19:14,243 --> 01:19:17,013
At the abortion clinics.

1098
01:19:17,514 --> 01:19:21,051
We don't like corrupt cops.

1099
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:25,389
Corrupt cops don't belong
here.

1100
01:19:26,356 --> 01:19:28,592
- Are you getting the boat?
- Yes, sir.

1101
01:19:28,592 --> 01:19:30,427
- Will you bring it to me?
- Yes, sir.

1102
01:19:30,427 --> 01:19:32,563
Let's see if you can
do it.

1103
01:19:35,032 --> 01:19:37,067
Give up 0-2.
You're weak!

1104
01:19:37,835 --> 01:19:40,305
Ask to leave, you'll never
make it.

1105
01:19:42,207 --> 01:19:44,575
Quit, you shithead!

1106
01:19:44,742 --> 01:19:47,846
- I can't, Captain.
- Don't listen to him 0-2!

1107
01:19:49,347 --> 01:19:50,716
I can't go on.

1108
01:19:51,617 --> 01:19:52,884
I can't go on, Captain.
I quit.

1109
01:19:52,884 --> 01:19:54,152
Louder.

1110
01:19:54,352 --> 01:19:56,955
So everybody can see how
weak you are.

1111
01:19:56,955 --> 01:20:00,359
- I give up!
- There it is, you piece of shit!

1112
01:20:00,492 --> 01:20:04,163
Attention brigade!
At ease!

1113
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:06,765
Facing the instructors.

1114
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:11,037
Special Operations!

1115
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:12,905
- You'll never be one of us.
- Never!

1116
01:20:13,873 --> 01:20:15,374
Attention, 12!

1117
01:20:17,076 --> 01:20:18,545
Yes, sir!

1118
01:20:18,678 --> 01:20:20,713
You're the leader, 12.

1119
01:20:22,148 --> 01:20:23,916
I give up, sir!

1120
01:20:26,753 --> 01:20:31,091
You're making us very happy.

1121
01:20:31,724 --> 01:20:34,627
Thanks, gentlemen!
Thank you very much!

1122
01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:37,130
Attention 0-8.

1123
01:20:38,065 --> 01:20:40,934
<i>Our farewell ceremony
was humiliating.</i>

1124
01:20:40,934 --> 01:20:43,337
<i>But it was wonderful.</i>

1125
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:48,042
<i>Fuck the weak and
the corrupt.</i>

1126
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:58,920
<i>After the first stage, only
eight were left.</i>

1127
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,091
<i>It was time to pick my
replacement.</i>

1128
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,929
<i>Matias surprised me.</i>

1129
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,532
<i>He passed the first stage.</i>

1130
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:13,568
<i>But he made the mistake of
going back to school.</i>

1131
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:18,607
- You know who told me?
- Wait, what happened?

1132
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:22,778
The slum leader!
You don't know what happens.

1133
01:21:22,778 --> 01:21:26,215
You know how long it took me to
set up the NGO?

1134
01:21:26,316 --> 01:21:28,918
How much work?
Do you know?

1135
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:30,453
Calm down, Maria.

1136
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:32,522
No! You had no right risking...

1137
01:21:32,522 --> 01:21:33,856
...my life like that.

1138
01:21:33,856 --> 01:21:35,725
- Don't yell.
- They threatened me, Andre.

1139
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,693
You don't understand,
they threatened me.

1140
01:21:37,693 --> 01:21:39,229
- Can I speak?
- No, you put me in danger.

1141
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:40,496
My friends are in danger.

1142
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:44,434
- I couldn't tell you.
- I can't trust you anymore.

1143
01:21:44,601 --> 01:21:48,171
You fucking son of a bitch!

1144
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:51,475
I couldn't tell you.
Wait!

1145
01:21:53,977 --> 01:21:55,312
Maria!

1146
01:21:59,516 --> 01:22:02,119
Tell me if I'm doing something
wrong.

1147
01:22:02,119 --> 01:22:05,189
- He's very quiet.
- Not too loose...

1148
01:22:05,289 --> 01:22:06,991
- Not too tight.
- But, I can leave it loose.

1149
01:22:06,991 --> 01:22:08,960
<i>Choosing a replacement for
a captain like me...</i>

1150
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,528
<i>...wasn't as easy as
it seemed.</i>

1151
01:22:10,528 --> 01:22:14,966
- Is there anybody good?
- There's one.

1152
01:22:14,966 --> 01:22:17,435
- Really?
- Yeah, he's a maniac.

1153
01:22:17,769 --> 01:22:20,105
Just like me when I
started.

1154
01:22:20,105 --> 01:22:22,507
<i>Picking the best soldier from the
group wasn't good enough.</i>

1155
01:22:22,507 --> 01:22:25,878
<i>He'd have to do my job.
I couldn't leave my men...</i>

1156
01:22:26,011 --> 01:22:29,948
<i>...without making sure they'd
be taken care of.</i>

1157
01:22:30,148 --> 01:22:31,116
These are good news.

1158
01:22:31,984 --> 01:22:35,120
I think I'll leave in a month
or so.

1159
01:22:37,423 --> 01:22:40,326
<i>Only three ranking officers passed
the first stage.</i>

1160
01:22:40,326 --> 01:22:43,162
<i>Azevedo was the first one to
choose his replacement.</i>

1161
01:22:44,163 --> 01:22:45,631
Move closer to the target!

1162
01:22:45,631 --> 01:22:47,701
<i>So I had to choose between
Neto and Matias.</i>

1163
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:48,567
Fire!

1164
01:22:51,738 --> 01:22:52,706
Fire!

1165
01:22:54,007 --> 01:22:56,276
Holster, your gun!

1166
01:22:56,376 --> 01:22:57,711
Good job, 0-6.

1167
01:22:57,877 --> 01:23:00,914
It's easy if you use
my gun.

1168
01:23:01,048 --> 01:23:02,116
Skulls!

1169
01:23:02,949 --> 01:23:04,784
Let's take a look at the
other four.

1170
01:23:04,784 --> 01:23:08,055
- 23, where's your strap?
- It fell, sir.

1171
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:12,827
At this stage of the game...
you don't have your strap?

1172
01:23:12,827 --> 01:23:14,762
What are you going to do
if your partner gets shot?

1173
01:23:14,762 --> 01:23:16,597
- Throw your weapon to the ground?
- No, sir.

1174
01:23:16,597 --> 01:23:17,832
- Throw it?
- No, sir.

1175
01:23:17,832 --> 01:23:19,367
Put on the damn strap!

1176
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:20,735
- Yes, sir.
- God!

1177
01:23:20,735 --> 01:23:23,604
Fuck!
Twenty years in this course!

1178
01:23:26,274 --> 01:23:29,710
<i>We teach our men how
to raid the slums...</i>

1179
01:23:30,245 --> 01:23:34,015
<i>...to surprise the gangsters.
They can't know how we got there.</i>

1180
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:40,489
<i>When we go, we get there at
night and by surprise.</i>

1181
01:23:40,789 --> 01:23:43,259
- With the zero-five strategy!
- Let's go 0-6!

1182
01:23:43,392 --> 01:23:45,827
Quick! Get down!

1183
01:23:45,894 --> 01:23:48,864
<i>BOPE troops don't enter the
slums shooting away.</i>

1184
01:23:52,501 --> 01:23:55,938
<i>They go forward, safely, strategically
moving in groups.</i>

1185
01:23:57,473 --> 01:24:01,043
Easy, 0-6.
Slow.

1186
01:24:01,378 --> 01:24:03,813
Slow, what do you
do now?

1187
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:08,618
Check the area, then you move.

1188
01:24:09,019 --> 01:24:11,421
Good, 0-6.
Very good.

1189
01:24:11,554 --> 01:24:13,356
Check and move.

1190
01:24:13,556 --> 01:24:16,459
Go forward.
Like that!

1191
01:24:18,161 --> 01:24:21,799
Calm down.
What do you do next? Wait.

1192
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:24,935
Did the reinforcement
arrive? Yes.

1193
01:24:25,235 --> 01:24:28,639
All hell can break loose,
but you stay calm.

1194
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:31,142
- Looking forward, are you ready?
- Yes.

1195
01:24:31,142 --> 01:24:34,745
Ok, go.
If you can move, do it.

1196
01:24:34,846 --> 01:24:37,081
Like that, 0-6!
Very good!

1197
01:24:37,081 --> 01:24:39,317
<i>Breaking into the slums
is a work of art.</i>

1198
01:24:40,184 --> 01:24:43,154
<i>It can't be learned only
in theory.</i>

1199
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:46,725
<i>Once we practiced it, we would
do it for real.</i>

1200
01:24:47,992 --> 01:24:49,093
<i>It was real.</i>

1201
01:24:49,093 --> 01:24:52,464
- Fuck! Police!
- Get inside!

1202
01:24:58,403 --> 01:24:59,905
Captain!

1203
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,042
- The lookout ran over there.
- Alone?

1204
01:25:03,042 --> 01:25:05,545
Yes.

1205
01:25:05,545 --> 01:25:07,413
- I'm going to...
- Wait!

1206
01:25:08,113 --> 01:25:11,183
I'm going!
Come back, you idiot!

1207
01:25:18,824 --> 01:25:21,294
<i>Mistakes were not allowed
in these operations.</i>

1208
01:25:21,795 --> 01:25:24,564
<i>Our men in black go to
the slums to kill.</i>

1209
01:25:24,564 --> 01:25:26,199
<i>Not to be killed.</i>

1210
01:25:28,034 --> 01:25:30,837
<i>My replacement would
have to know this.</i>

1211
01:25:39,914 --> 01:25:42,116
- What's wrong Lieutenant?
- Move!

1212
01:25:55,196 --> 01:25:57,432
To the roof, Renan!
The roof!

1213
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:04,973
Come back, you idiot!

1214
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:10,946
Get your ass over here!
Come back!

1215
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:20,556
You don't deserve this
uniform.

1216
01:26:20,556 --> 01:26:24,627
You're not a skull,
you're a fool.

1217
01:26:25,128 --> 01:26:28,397
Are you listening?
You're a fool.

1218
01:26:44,814 --> 01:26:46,783
What are you taking?

1219
01:26:50,687 --> 01:26:52,890
It's nothing.

1220
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:55,192
- Let me see.
- Everybody takes them.

1221
01:26:55,459 --> 01:26:57,061
It's ok.

1222
01:26:59,263 --> 01:27:01,299
You won't have to take
them anymore.

1223
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,768
You're leaving soon, things
will get better.

1224
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:06,671
Am I leaving?

1225
01:27:07,205 --> 01:27:11,076
- Leaving from where?
- BOPE.

1226
01:27:11,109 --> 01:27:12,577
Aren't you?

1227
01:27:13,111 --> 01:27:14,813
What's wrong?

1228
01:27:18,349 --> 01:27:21,119
Aren't you quitting?
Everything's been taken care of.

1229
01:27:24,022 --> 01:27:25,724
What happened?

1230
01:27:25,957 --> 01:27:27,959
I chose the wrong man.

1231
01:27:29,495 --> 01:27:32,364
- What?
- I chose the wrong man, I made a mistake.

1232
01:27:32,364 --> 01:27:36,168
Azevedo picked well
and I chose the maniac.

1233
01:27:36,268 --> 01:27:40,540
- But now you have a son.
- So what? Azevedo has two.

1234
01:27:40,673 --> 01:27:44,110
Quiet!
The baby is sleeping.

1235
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:48,581
<i>There was something that bothered
me more than making mistakes...</i>

1236
01:27:48,581 --> 01:27:53,720
Don't dismiss the kid.
Give him another chance.

1237
01:27:54,254 --> 01:27:57,357
<i>...and that was having Rosane
tell me what to do.</i>

1238
01:27:57,357 --> 01:27:58,826
When is graduation?

1239
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:04,297
When is graduation?

1240
01:28:05,232 --> 01:28:07,668
Come on honey, everything
will be ok.

1241
01:28:07,768 --> 01:28:11,672
<i>The worst thing was that sometimes
I took her advice.</i>

1242
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:15,809
- This is what I want.
- This? Are you sure?

1243
01:28:16,677 --> 01:28:19,147
Look at the book.

1244
01:28:19,313 --> 01:28:21,850
- There's an indian...
- No indian!

1245
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:23,918
I want the knife and skull.

1246
01:28:43,973 --> 01:28:45,941
Hands up in the air,
to the wall!

1247
01:28:46,075 --> 01:28:49,645
<i>When our men graduate,
they're all hyped up.</i>

1248
01:28:50,112 --> 01:28:52,014
<i>Neto was the most bloodthirsty.</i>

1249
01:28:53,716 --> 01:28:57,453
<i>He signed up for
Operation Holiness.</i>

1250
01:28:58,154 --> 01:29:01,491
<i>He wanted to guarantee
a quiet night for the Pope.</i>

1251
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:12,769
<i>And as part of my group...</i>

1252
01:29:12,869 --> 01:29:15,672
<i>...he killed thirty gangsters
during the first week.</i>

1253
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,283
<i>Even though we prepare our
men for warfare...</i>

1254
01:29:26,818 --> 01:29:29,587
<i>...some people may think
we're inhumane.</i>

1255
01:29:29,921 --> 01:29:34,125
<i>But the drug dealers are armed,
so there is no choice.</i>

1256
01:29:34,492 --> 01:29:36,628
<i>Every BOPE officer knows this.</i>

1257
01:29:38,563 --> 01:29:40,598
<i>Now, even Matias was
learning this.</i>

1258
01:29:40,598 --> 01:29:44,536
<i>And you know what? It was time to
confront these drug addicts.</i>

1259
01:29:46,138 --> 01:29:48,506
I'll see you!

1260
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:51,543
Come here, you idiot!
Come!

1261
01:29:51,777 --> 01:29:54,079
- Calm down!
- I want to talk to you.

1262
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:56,081
I won't arrest you, for now.

1263
01:29:56,081 --> 01:29:57,783
You don't scare me.

1264
01:29:57,783 --> 01:30:00,519
Wipe that smile off
your face.

1265
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:04,923
- You see these glasses?
- Yeah.

1266
01:30:05,091 --> 01:30:07,826
They're Romerito's.
Leave them!

1267
01:30:08,127 --> 01:30:12,065
You don't deserve to help him,
so I'll give these to him.

1268
01:30:12,065 --> 01:30:13,399
If you go to the slum
you'll get killed.

1269
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:16,970
I don't hang around drug
addicts or scumbag like you.

1270
01:30:18,838 --> 01:30:21,040
This is what you'll do.

1271
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:25,979
Tell the boy to go to the arcade
tomorrow at noon.

1272
01:30:26,246 --> 01:30:30,350
- No, ask Maria to do it.
- Wait! Are you crazy?

1273
01:30:31,251 --> 01:30:34,689
If you don't do it, I'll
arrest you.

1274
01:30:35,289 --> 01:30:36,991
You understand this?

1275
01:30:36,991 --> 01:30:40,127
You think I don't know what
you sell at school?

1276
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:44,765
Tomorrow at noon.

1277
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:02,518
I'll get you a new nose...

1278
01:31:02,651 --> 01:31:04,686
...because you're sniffing a
lot of this stuff.

1279
01:31:04,686 --> 01:31:06,222
It's us.

1280
01:31:07,756 --> 01:31:09,057
Xaveco.

1281
01:31:12,861 --> 01:31:14,730
Here, goldilocks.

1282
01:31:14,897 --> 01:31:16,598
I'm not taking anything
today, Baiano.

1283
01:31:16,598 --> 01:31:21,103
- The situation at school is bad.
- Are you kidding? Why?

1284
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:24,807
That fucking cop!
He said he'd arrest me.

1285
01:31:24,907 --> 01:31:26,175
Which one?

1286
01:31:26,308 --> 01:31:28,645
- Which one, boss?
- Who?

1287
01:31:31,848 --> 01:31:34,717
- Tell me what's going on.
- It's nonsense.

1288
01:31:34,717 --> 01:31:36,887
What nonsense?

1289
01:31:37,587 --> 01:31:39,923
What nonsense, you asshole?

1290
01:31:40,758 --> 01:31:42,893
- Neto!
- What's up, Andre?

1291
01:31:43,026 --> 01:31:45,696
- I have a message for you.
- Which one?

1292
01:31:45,996 --> 01:31:48,098
From the lawyer's office.

1293
01:31:48,098 --> 01:31:50,834
To confirm your interview and
I told them you'd go.

1294
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:55,473
Maria arranged this. I don't need any
favors from her.

1295
01:31:55,606 --> 01:31:58,877
Are you crazy, Andre?
Don't be a fool, this is your chance.

1296
01:31:58,877 --> 01:32:02,246
You have to get that job!

1297
01:32:02,413 --> 01:32:06,250
What's wrong?
Don't stutter, you idiot.

1298
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:07,385
- Spit it out!
- Good!

1299
01:32:07,385 --> 01:32:10,221
- There's a boy at the NGO.
- Fuck it!

1300
01:32:10,321 --> 01:32:13,124
The cop wants to help him.

1301
01:32:13,157 --> 01:32:17,362
I can't, I have to give
Romerito his glasses.

1302
01:32:17,862 --> 01:32:20,832
The boy was born blind.
Can't he wait one more day?

1303
01:32:20,832 --> 01:32:23,668
What's he going to do?
Tell me everything.

1304
01:32:23,803 --> 01:32:25,270
I'll tell you!

1305
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:28,373
- Is he bringing them here?
- No, not here.

1306
01:32:28,507 --> 01:32:31,844
You know I have to do it.

1307
01:32:32,345 --> 01:32:34,146
Where are you going to
see him?

1308
01:32:34,146 --> 01:32:36,449
- At the arcade.
- What time?

1309
01:32:36,582 --> 01:32:39,552
- Tell me, damn it!
- At noon.

1310
01:32:48,494 --> 01:32:50,496
<i>Years later, Matias told me...</i>

1311
01:32:50,496 --> 01:32:54,968
<i>...he wouldn't have gone if Neto
had not persisted.</i>

1312
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:59,039
<i>Deep down, he wanted to be
a lawyer.</i>

1313
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,708
What are your plans after
you finish school?

1314
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:03,810
I'd like to specialize in criminal law.

1315
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:06,380
<i>I hadn't made a mistake when I
chose my replacement.</i>

1316
01:33:13,888 --> 01:33:16,090
Do you have another coin?

1317
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,425
Are you losing or winning?

1318
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:19,894
- Losing.
- You have to win.

1319
01:33:20,295 --> 01:33:22,230
Ze, give him another one.

1320
01:33:33,475 --> 01:33:36,011
- Romerito!
- He's here! Let's go boss!

1321
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:37,613
Calm down.

1322
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,648
There's a kid here, relax.

1323
01:33:39,815 --> 01:33:41,784
- Are you Romerito?
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:33:42,985 --> 01:33:44,787
I have something for you.

1325
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:49,993
Now you'll see better.

1326
01:33:49,993 --> 01:33:52,729
- Where's Andre?
- Working, try them on.

1327
01:33:53,162 --> 01:33:56,132
- Very nice!
- Now you look like a grown man.

1328
01:33:56,299 --> 01:33:57,801
Stop kidding around.

1329
01:33:59,035 --> 01:34:01,405
Sir, I think you'd better go.

1330
01:34:04,408 --> 01:34:06,143
Get in!

1331
01:34:12,016 --> 01:34:16,220
Don't shoot.
I'll finish off this scumbag.

1332
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:22,593
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck?

1333
01:34:24,995 --> 01:34:26,431
Fuck!

1334
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,270
This asshole is BOPE!
Let's go!

1335
01:34:32,703 --> 01:34:35,706
<i>Baiano knew that if Neto died,
he'd also be dead.</i>

1336
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:41,346
<i>If he killed a BOPE officer,
he'd be sentenced to death.</i>

1337
01:34:42,981 --> 01:34:45,150
<i>But the dealers didn't make
things any easier.</i>

1338
01:34:45,751 --> 01:34:49,721
<i>Baiano had warned them he didn't
want any policemen in his slum.</i>

1339
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:51,523
<i>He would make them pay.</i>

1340
01:34:56,528 --> 01:34:59,999
<i>But those rich students with social
conscience didn't understand this.</i>

1341
01:34:59,999 --> 01:35:02,735
<i>They just didn't understand
this.</i>

1342
01:35:04,737 --> 01:35:07,273
What the fuck...
You can't come in like this!

1343
01:35:07,273 --> 01:35:09,108
- Shut up!
- Fuck!

1344
01:35:21,288 --> 01:35:23,056
Put down the gun, Tinho.

1345
01:35:23,056 --> 01:35:25,759
What's wrong?

1346
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:50,084
Can you tell me where I
can find Matias?

1347
01:35:50,318 --> 01:35:51,786
He's over there.

1348
01:35:54,523 --> 01:35:56,191
He'll make it, Carvalho.

1349
01:35:56,191 --> 01:35:57,792
- But, Nascimento.
- He'll make it.

1350
01:35:57,792 --> 01:36:01,496
- He was shot twice in the back.
- Yeah, but he'll survive.

1351
01:36:04,466 --> 01:36:06,335
What do you want?

1352
01:36:06,902 --> 01:36:09,504
- Is your friend ok?
- No.

1353
01:36:11,206 --> 01:36:16,245
I went to the police station, they said
there's nothing they can do.

1354
01:36:16,245 --> 01:36:20,283
- And Romerito? How is he?
- Fine, he's staying with me.

1355
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:21,917
But...

1356
01:36:23,053 --> 01:36:25,755
They took Roberta and
Rodrigues.

1357
01:36:27,758 --> 01:36:30,761
Don't worry, Baiano has
a social conscience.

1358
01:36:31,061 --> 01:36:34,430
Andre, I'm serious.
Rodrigues was bleeding.

1359
01:36:35,231 --> 01:36:37,501
You told me you were an
honest cop?

1360
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:39,603
Now it's ok for me to be
a cop?

1361
01:36:42,038 --> 01:36:45,442
It doesn't matter, I'm sure your
friends are dead by now.

1362
01:36:50,948 --> 01:36:54,085
Don't do it!

1363
01:36:56,488 --> 01:36:59,857
- For God's sake!
- I warned you, didn't I?

1364
01:37:06,764 --> 01:37:09,001
Burn this asshole.

1365
01:37:09,001 --> 01:37:11,169
- Burn him!
- Burn, asshole!

1366
01:37:11,169 --> 01:37:13,706
- No!
- Light it up.

1367
01:37:31,557 --> 01:37:32,959
Everything ok?

1368
01:37:32,959 --> 01:37:35,461
Don't talk again about my job.

1369
01:37:35,461 --> 01:37:36,029
What?

1370
01:37:36,029 --> 01:37:38,798
No more talking about my job
in this house!

1371
01:37:38,798 --> 01:37:42,235
Understood?
I give the orders.

1372
01:37:42,235 --> 01:37:46,005
Not one more word about
my team.

1373
01:37:46,005 --> 01:37:48,908
Is that clear?
Understood?

1374
01:37:51,478 --> 01:37:54,448
I give the fucking orders here!

1375
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:14,702
Listen, go and stay with your mom.
Come back when I tell you to.

1376
01:38:14,702 --> 01:38:17,672
Where are you going?
Tell me.

1377
01:38:17,973 --> 01:38:20,976
I'll stay around here.

1378
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:28,417
<i>Two bodies were found at
the Prazeres slum.</i>

1379
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:34,022
<i>It's believed that the bodies belong to
the student Roberta Fontes...</i>

1380
01:38:34,022 --> 01:38:36,192
<i>...daughter of the businessman
Alceu Fontes.</i>

1381
01:38:36,192 --> 01:38:38,694
<i>And to the social worker
Pedro Rodrigues.</i>

1382
01:38:38,694 --> 01:38:41,764
<i>Our reporter Ana Luiza is interviewing
the Secretary of Security...</i>

1383
01:38:41,764 --> 01:38:44,834
<i>...who just gave a press
conference.</i>

1384
01:38:44,834 --> 01:38:48,771
<i>Is this Fontes' body?</i>

1385
01:38:49,305 --> 01:38:54,744
<i>We have to wait until we have the
report in order to be sure.</i>

1386
01:38:54,911 --> 01:38:58,348
<i>We're doing what we can
to help the families.</i>

1387
01:39:04,087 --> 01:39:06,556
- What's wrong aunty?
- Are you ok?

1388
01:39:24,775 --> 01:39:26,177
Fire!

1389
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:07,753
<i>For Matias, Neto's death was
a complete tragedy.</i>

1390
01:40:08,654 --> 01:40:11,391
<i>They'd been friends since
they were little kids.</i>

1391
01:40:16,096 --> 01:40:18,532
<i>I thought I could use
his pain...</i>

1392
01:40:19,099 --> 01:40:21,335
<i>...to complete my mission.</i>

1393
01:40:30,177 --> 01:40:33,715
- What are you doing here?
- I didn't come to argue.

1394
01:40:33,915 --> 01:40:37,652
I only asked what you
were doing here.

1395
01:40:37,785 --> 01:40:39,787
I think I can help you.

1396
01:40:40,522 --> 01:40:42,457
How?

1397
01:40:44,726 --> 01:40:47,295
I know somebody who can help.

1398
01:40:47,795 --> 01:40:49,097
Who?

1399
01:40:51,399 --> 01:40:54,602
I'll tell you if you promise me
that you won't hurt her.

1400
01:40:57,606 --> 01:40:59,608
Of course, who is it?

1401
01:41:03,111 --> 01:41:04,547
Rosa.

1402
01:41:06,782 --> 01:41:08,951
Now this bitch will talk.

1403
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,957
Tell us!

1404
01:41:14,991 --> 01:41:17,293
- Where's your fucking boyfriend?
- I don't know.

1405
01:41:17,293 --> 01:41:19,362
- Where the fuck is he?
- I don't know.

1406
01:41:19,362 --> 01:41:21,565
Where is he?

1407
01:41:21,965 --> 01:41:24,000
- I don't know.
- Tell us!

1408
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,001
Where is he? Fuck!

1409
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:27,271
- You think I'm playing?
- Tell us!

1410
01:41:27,471 --> 01:41:30,039
Speak!

1411
01:41:31,308 --> 01:41:33,443
Where?

1412
01:41:47,425 --> 01:41:49,059
Hands in the air!
Look at me.

1413
01:41:49,159 --> 01:41:50,795
Look at me.
Don't do anything!

1414
01:41:50,795 --> 01:41:53,664
Don't do anything!

1415
01:41:54,932 --> 01:41:57,602
- Where's Baiano?
- I don't know.

1416
01:41:57,868 --> 01:42:01,639
- Fuck! Where's Baiano?
- Quick! Tell me!

1417
01:42:01,639 --> 01:42:05,243
Matias, you have to persist with
these guys, understood?

1418
01:42:05,310 --> 01:42:07,546
Where the fuck is Baiano?
Son of a bitch!

1419
01:42:07,846 --> 01:42:10,015
- Where's Baiano?
- Where is he?

1420
01:42:14,853 --> 01:42:16,255
Where is he?

1421
01:42:16,255 --> 01:42:18,157
I didn't know the playboy was
one of you guys.

1422
01:42:18,157 --> 01:42:19,791
Which playboy?

1423
01:42:20,226 --> 01:42:24,163
Captain, I know who he's
talking about.

1424
01:43:13,615 --> 01:43:17,251
<i>It's funny, but here, nobody complains
when a cop gets killed.</i>

1425
01:43:17,786 --> 01:43:20,289
<i>They only do when it affects
rich people.</i>

1426
01:43:20,555 --> 01:43:23,525
<i>When I see these kids
protesting...</i>

1427
01:43:23,692 --> 01:43:26,661
<i>...I feel like beating
them up.</i>

1428
01:43:27,496 --> 01:43:29,064
- Son of a bitch!
- Enough!

1429
01:43:32,067 --> 01:43:33,903
- What are you doing?
- Let me go!

1430
01:43:36,739 --> 01:43:38,708
- Enough!
- Son of a bitch!

1431
01:43:40,175 --> 01:43:44,880
- Go away!
- Let go of me!

1432
01:43:45,248 --> 01:43:47,517
- Enough!
- He killed my friend!

1433
01:43:48,051 --> 01:43:50,486
- He killed my friend!
- Let go of me!

1434
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,856
- Enough, Matias!
- Let me go!

1435
01:43:53,089 --> 01:43:56,092
Are you going to hit a cop?
You're going to hit me now?

1436
01:43:58,461 --> 01:44:02,499
Fucking scumbag!
You're just like him!

1437
01:44:02,733 --> 01:44:04,868
A bunch of bourgeois shitheads!

1438
01:44:06,137 --> 01:44:08,105
Go away, Andre!
Get lost!

1439
01:44:08,405 --> 01:44:11,208
What? Bitch!
You're just like him!

1440
01:44:12,176 --> 01:44:14,111
A bunch of fucking drug
addicts!

1441
01:44:14,278 --> 01:44:16,681
<i>Matias not only wanted revenge...</i>

1442
01:44:17,314 --> 01:44:19,651
<i>...now he was becoming
a true BOPE officer.</i>

1443
01:44:19,784 --> 01:44:23,154
- Open the fucking door!
- Easy! Put the gun down!

1444
01:44:23,254 --> 01:44:24,121
Where are the drugs?

1445
01:44:24,121 --> 01:44:26,758
Where? Fuck!
Son of a bitch!

1446
01:44:26,924 --> 01:44:28,893
Where the fuck is it?

1447
01:44:28,893 --> 01:44:31,363
- Where's the stuff?
- Ok.

1448
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:35,400
Go and get it, asshole.
Fucker!

1449
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:39,137
Hurry up!

1450
01:44:40,205 --> 01:44:42,875
Come on!

1451
01:44:44,109 --> 01:44:48,013
<i>My mission was no longer
safeguarding the Pope's stay.</i>

1452
01:44:48,013 --> 01:44:50,816
<i>Neto had already
done that.</i>

1453
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:55,221
<i>I had to go back home
and find a good replacement.</i>

1454
01:44:58,491 --> 01:45:02,228
<i>But before, I had to
get Baiano.</i>

1455
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:06,733
<i>What I was doing
wasn't good.</i>

1456
01:45:06,733 --> 01:45:10,169
Get up, against the wall!
Take off your shirt!

1457
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:13,740
<i>I couldn't go to
innocent peoples' homes.</i>

1458
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:17,877
<i>This was very important
for me.</i>

1459
01:45:17,877 --> 01:45:19,980
<i>Nothing was going
to stop me.</i>

1460
01:45:20,114 --> 01:45:22,717
Andre, let's go and check
up there.

1461
01:45:22,717 --> 01:45:25,753
There're no drug dealers
upstairs.

1462
01:45:25,753 --> 01:45:27,755
We'll have to go
door to door.

1463
01:45:28,122 --> 01:45:29,256
Open up!

1464
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:31,759
Police!
Hands on the table!

1465
01:45:31,959 --> 01:45:34,429
Wake up you bum!
Get up!

1466
01:45:36,331 --> 01:45:38,633
- Good morning!
- Good morning, sir!

1467
01:45:38,733 --> 01:45:42,103
- Can I check your bedroom?
- Yes, sir.

1468
01:45:42,437 --> 01:45:44,372
- May I?
- Of course.

1469
01:45:44,372 --> 01:45:47,308
0-4, could you look in
the closet?

1470
01:45:50,746 --> 01:45:53,515
Look what I found, 0-1.

1471
01:45:53,515 --> 01:45:56,418
Those shoes cost more than
what we earn in a month.

1472
01:45:56,418 --> 01:45:59,288
- Where did you get them?
- I won them, sir.

1473
01:45:59,288 --> 01:46:01,290
Now you lost them.
Let's go.

1474
01:46:01,457 --> 01:46:05,061
We'll be in trouble, Captain.
People are watching us.

1475
01:46:05,327 --> 01:46:08,530
- We're creating problems.
- Renan, this kid killed Neto.

1476
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:10,767
I came to get him
and it'll be finished today.

1477
01:46:10,767 --> 01:46:14,737
- You want to leave?
- We'll end up at the station.

1478
01:46:14,737 --> 01:46:19,108
You want to go? No problem.
Take your team.

1479
01:46:19,576 --> 01:46:21,444
If you're so worried,
take them.

1480
01:46:21,444 --> 01:46:24,147
- Let's go, Renan.
- Ok, let's go.

1481
01:46:24,847 --> 01:46:27,450
Are you a student?
Can you fly?

1482
01:46:27,450 --> 01:46:30,854
Come here.
On your knees!

1483
01:46:31,655 --> 01:46:35,726
Look, I don't want to
hurt you.

1484
01:46:35,726 --> 01:46:37,160
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

1485
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,896
- Where's Baiano?
- I don't know sir.

1486
01:46:38,896 --> 01:46:40,331
Tell us!
You want to be a tough guy?

1487
01:46:40,331 --> 01:46:42,700
You want the bag on your head?

1488
01:46:43,601 --> 01:46:45,703
Put him on his knees.

1489
01:46:45,836 --> 01:46:49,841
- Where is he? Tell me!
- I don't know.

1490
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:51,242
- Where is he? Tell me!
- I don't know.

1491
01:46:51,242 --> 01:46:53,845
- Where is he? Tell me!
- I don't know.

1492
01:46:55,346 --> 01:46:57,348
Put the bag on!

1493
01:47:08,093 --> 01:47:09,761
- Where's Baiano?
- I don't know, sir.

1494
01:47:09,761 --> 01:47:12,464
Where is he, you son
of a bitch?

1495
01:47:12,597 --> 01:47:14,133
Where?

1496
01:47:14,133 --> 01:47:17,136
- I don't know, sir
- Captain, he's not talking.

1497
01:47:18,203 --> 01:47:21,006
- Take off his pants.
- Yes, sir.

1498
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:24,176
- Fuck!
- Talk, you motherfucker!

1499
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:27,347
What an ass!
Give me that!

1500
01:47:29,682 --> 01:47:34,354
Pull down his pants!
Are you going to tell us?

1501
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:37,858
- Ok, I'll talk.
- Are you going to tell us?

1502
01:47:38,124 --> 01:47:40,561
- Yes.
- Come on, take him away.

1503
01:47:53,307 --> 01:47:54,976
Shit, Xaveco.

1504
01:47:57,578 --> 01:47:59,947
Something's wrong.

1505
01:48:00,748 --> 01:48:03,551
Calm down, boss.
You have to be alert.

1506
01:48:04,018 --> 01:48:08,323
Something's wrong.
It's too quiet.

1507
01:48:10,658 --> 01:48:13,528
- Everything is ok, boss.
- It's not ok.

1508
01:48:14,662 --> 01:48:17,399
Bring me some water
and have a look around.

1509
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,796
All clear, Captain!

1510
01:48:54,671 --> 01:48:56,473
Listen, boss.

1511
01:48:57,674 --> 01:49:00,911
I can give you 30 dollars,
if you take me to the hospital.

1512
01:49:03,647 --> 01:49:05,916
It's over, motherfucker.

1513
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:09,453
You're going to die.

1514
01:49:09,554 --> 01:49:12,490
- Not in the face!
- What?

1515
01:49:12,657 --> 01:49:14,792
Not in the face, for the funeral.

1516
01:49:16,394 --> 01:49:18,229
<i>I already had Baiano.</i>

1517
01:49:18,296 --> 01:49:22,600
0-7, give me the 12" one.
Let the kid go.

1518
01:49:23,301 --> 01:49:25,971
<i>I just needed to see Matias'
heart.</i>

1519
01:49:25,971 --> 01:49:27,939
<i>Then, my mission would be
accomplished.</i>

1520
01:49:30,008 --> 01:49:31,242
<i>And I could go back
to my family.</i>

1521
01:49:31,242 --> 01:49:34,279
<i>Knowing that my replacement
deserved to have my job.</i>

1522
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:36,915
He's all yours.

1523
01:49:37,816 --> 01:49:39,017
Wait.

1524
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:47,026
Not in the face!
