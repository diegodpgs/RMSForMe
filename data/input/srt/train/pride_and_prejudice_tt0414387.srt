And that put paid to it.

162

the power of poetry

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,584
I thought that poetry was the food of love.

Of a fine, stout love, it may.

166

But if it is only a vague inclination,

will kill it stone dead.

I do not believe marriage

- I agree entirely.

176

Jane, he danced with you most of the night

00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:49,065
after sitting so long in one attitude?

319
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:52,109
And it is a small kind
of accomplishment, I suppose.

320
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,987
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

321
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,281
You can only have two motives, Caroline,

322
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:58,908
and I would interfere with either.

323
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:00,242
What can he mean?

324
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:03,996
Our surest way of disappointing him
will be to ask him nothing about it.

325
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,998
But do tell us, Mr Darcy.

326
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:11,212
Either you are in each other's confidence

327
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,131
and you have secret affairs to discuss,

328
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:16,967
or you are conscious that your figures

329
00:22:17,177 --> 00:22:19,761
appear to the greatest advantage by walking.

330
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:23,932
If the first, I should get in your way.

331
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:26,476
If the second, I can admire you
much better from here.

332
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560

How shall we punish him for such a speech?

335
00:22:30,356 --> 00:22:31,439
We could always laugh at him.

336
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:34,150
Oh, no, Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

337
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,486
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy?

338
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,947
And would you consider pride
a fault or a virtue?

339
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:40,156
That I couldn't say.

340
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,200
Because we're doing our best
to find fault in you.

341
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:43,785
Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive

342
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:46,871
the follies and vices of others,
or their of fences against me.

343
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:50,166
My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.

344
00:22:52,877 --> 00:22:55,462
Oh, dear, I cannot tease you about that.

345
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:58,799
What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.

346
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,884
CAROLINE: A family trait, I think.

347
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:31,372
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,

348
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:34,542
a Miss Bennet, and a Miss Bennet, sir.

349
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,043
Oh, for heaven's sake, are we to receive

350
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:38,087
every Bennet in the country?

351
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:43,551
What an excellent room you have, sir.

352
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:46,888
Such expensive furnishings.

353
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:50,975
Oh, I do hope you intend
to stay here, Mr Bingley.

354
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,769
Absolutely. I find the country very diverting.

355
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:55,771
Don't you agree, Darcy?

356
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,107
I find it perfectly adequate,

357
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,110
even if society's
a little less varied than in town.

358
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:03,028
MRS BENNET: Less varied? Not at all.

359
00:24:03,196 --> 00:24:06,865
We dine with four and twenty
families of all shapes and sizes.

360
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:11,411
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man

361
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,916
and a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

362
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,793
LYDIA: Mr Bingley, is it true
that you've promised

363
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:21,296
- to hold a ball here at Netherfield?
- A ball?

364
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:23,798
It would be an excellent way
to meet new friends.

365
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:26,426
You could invite the militia.
They're excellent company.

366
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,511
- Oh, do hold a ball.
- ELIZABETH: Kitty.

367
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:32,390
When your sister is recovered,
you shall name the day.

368
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:34,726
I think a ball is a perfectly irrational way

369
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,311
to gain new acquaintance.

370
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,396
It would be better if conversation,
instead of dancing,

371
00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:40,814
were the order of the day.

372
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:44,026
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

373
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:46,654
Thank you, Mary.

374
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:51,867
MRS BENNET: What a fine, imposing place
it is, to be sure, is it not, my dears?

375
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,037
There's no house to equal it in the county.

376
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:57,414
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

377
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:58,791
There she is.

378
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:00,668
Mr Bingley, I don't know how to thank you.

379
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:03,462
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

380
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:05,339
Thank you for your stimulating company.

381
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:06,924
It has been most instructive.

382
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:09,426
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

383
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:15,515
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

And then, there was one
with great long lashes like a cow.

LYDIA: Did you see him?
He looked right at me.

386
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,618
MRS BENNET: Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

387

I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

390
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:49,089
I have reason to expect an addition
to our family party.

391
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,092

He's the dreaded cousin.

392

- CHARLOTTE: Who's to inherit.
- Indeed. Everything, apparently.

393
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,973
Even my piano stool belongs to Mr Collins.

394
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,099
When?

395
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,184
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

396
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,519
But why?

397
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,981
Because the estate passes directly
to him and not to us poor females.

398
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,363
Mr Collins, at your service.

399
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,917
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent boiled potatoes.

400
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:31,297
Many years since I've had
such an exemplary vegetable.

401

To which of my fair cousins

402
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,968
should I compliment the excellence
of the cooking?

403
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,221
Mr Collins, we are perfectly able
to keep a cook.

404
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,639
COLLINS: Excellent.

405
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,268
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

406
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,149
I am honoured to have as my patroness,

407
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,901
Lady Catherine de Bourg.

408
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,778
You've heard of her, I presume?

409
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,865
My small rectory abuts her estate,

410
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:01,868
Rosings Park, and she often condescends

411
00:27:01,952 --> 00:27:06,664
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

412
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,542
Does she have any family?

413
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:13,546
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

414
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:16,674
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

415
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,886
that her daughter seemed born to be a duchess,

416
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,307
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

417
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,727
These are the kind of
little delicate compliments

418
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,437
which are always acceptable to the ladies

419
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:34,149
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

420
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:36,944
BENNET: How happy for you, Mr Collins,

421
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:40,656
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

422
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,868
Do these pleasing attentions proceed from

423
00:27:44,953 --> 00:27:46,412
the impulse of the moment

424
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:48,872
or are they the result of previous study?

425
00:27:48,998 --> 00:27:51,250
COLLINS: They arise chiefly
from what is passing at the time,

426
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:52,918
and though I do sometimes amuse myself

427
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:55,546
with arranging such little elegant compliments,

428
00:27:56,214 --> 00:28:00,467
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

I have become aware of the fact.

Well, it is my avowed hope that soon

Dear, oh, dear. You must be
the shame of the regiment.

477
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:34,575
- A laughingstock.
- What do your superiors do with you?

478
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:38,829
Ignore me.

479
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,332
I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

LYDIA: Lizzie, lend me some money.

481

You already owe me a fortune, Liddy.

482
00:30:46,963 --> 00:30:50,382
- Allow me to oblige.
- ELIZABETH: Oh, no, Mr Wickham, please.

483
00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:57,180
I insist.

- I don't know.

- Look, Mr Bingley.
- Mr Bingley!

489

I was just on my way to your house.

490
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:12,153
Mr Bingley, how do you like
my ribbons for your ball?

491
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:14,655
Very beautiful.

492
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,907
She is. Look at her. She's blooming.

493
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,200
Oh, Lydia.

494
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,371
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham,
he is a credit to his profession.

495
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:25,124
JANE: Lydia, you can't invite people
to other people's balls.

496
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,378
Of course you must come, Mr Wickham.

497
00:31:29,504 --> 00:31:32,340
If you'll excuse me, ladies. Enjoy the day.

498
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,303
ELIZABETH: Do you plan to go to the
Netherfield ball, then, Mr Wickham?

499
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:40,388
Perhaps.

500
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:43,725
How long has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

501
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:46,311
About a month.

502
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,315
Forgive me, but are you acquainted with him?

503
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:52,567
With Mr Darcy?

504
00:31:52,735 --> 00:31:56,154
Indeed. I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

505
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:59,908
You may well be surprised, Miss Elizabeth,

506
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:03,078
especially given our cold greeting
this afternoon.

507
00:32:04,997 --> 00:32:07,666
Well, I hope that your plans
in favour of Meryton

508
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,959
will not be affected by
your relations with the gentleman.

509
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:12,544
Oh, no, it is not for me to be driven away.

510
00:32:12,754 --> 00:32:15,756
If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go,

511
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:17,424
not I.

512
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,135
I must ask, Mr Wickham,

513
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,763
what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

514
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,102
My father managed his estate.

515
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:31,522
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

516
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:35,025
His father treated me like a second son.

517
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,902
Loved me like a son.

518
00:32:38,697 --> 00:32:41,281
We were both with him the day he died.

519
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:45,035
With his last breath,

520
00:32:45,704 --> 00:32:48,621
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

521
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:51,958
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the church.

522
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:55,795
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

523
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:58,381
- But why?
- Jealousy.

524
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,301
His father...

525
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:06,472
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

526
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:10,476
- How cruel.
- So now, I'm a poor foot soldier,

527
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:12,812
too lowly even to be noticed.

- Breathe in.
- I can't any more. You're hurting.

00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:36,877
Betsy.

534
00:33:48,723 --> 00:33:50,766
I still think there must have been
a misunderstanding.

535
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,809
Oh, Jane, do you never think ill of anybody?

536
00:33:52,894 --> 00:33:55,353
Well, how could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

537
00:33:56,897 --> 00:33:58,814
I'll discover the truth from Mr Bingley

538
00:33:58,899 --> 00:33:59,940
at the ball this evening.

539
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:02,943
If it is not true,
let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

540
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:05,321
Till he does, I hope never to encounter him.

541
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:07,656
Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.

542
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:10,493
On the contrary,
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,703
And let us hope, a rather more willing dancer.

May I say what an immense pleasure it is

- to see you again, Mr Bingley.
- Mrs Bennet.

- Miss Bingley.
- Charming.

- I'm so pleased you're here.
- So am I.

551
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,806
And how are you?

552
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:19,601
Miss Elizabeth, are you looking for someone?

553
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:21,812
No. No, not at all.

I was just admiring the general splendour.

555
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:26,525
It is breath-taking, Mr Bingley.

passed a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

what's best for her family.

Lizzie. Mr Wickham is not here.

565
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:33,173
Apparently he's been detained.

Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth?

I did not think you danced, Mr Collins.

571
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,316
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman

572
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,776
to indulge in such an innocent diversion.

573

In fact, several people, well,
Her Ladyship included,

To be sure, dancing is of
little consequence to me,

but it does...

580
00:37:38,612 --> 00:37:40,822
It does harbour the opportunity to lavish...

581

To lavish upon one's partner...

582
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:47,954
And my informer tells me

583
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:49,038
that he would have been less inclined...

That gentleman barely warrants the name.

It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

Did I just agree to dance with Mr Darcy?

I daresay you will find him
very amiable, Lizzie.

It would be most inconvenient,

to loathe him for all eternity.

It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy.

606
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,372
I talked about the dance,
now you ought to remark

00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:19,209
on the size of the room
or the number of couples.

Please advise me
of what you would like most to hear.

Perhaps by and by,
I may observe that private balls

don't you think?

Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

of retaining them is less certain.

He's been so unfortunate
as to lose your friendship.

perhaps I may state my reasons for marrying.

731
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,453
Firstly, that it is the duty of a clergyman

00:47:48,538 --> 00:47:51,331
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.

733

Secondly, that I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

734
00:47:55,461 --> 00:47:58,921
And thirdly, that it is at the urging

735
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:01,591
of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine,

736
00:48:02,175 --> 00:48:03,926
that I select a wife.

737
00:48:04,845 --> 00:48:08,389
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

738
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:10,141
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

739
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:14,103
for I am to inherit the estate,

740
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,273
and such an alliance will surely

741

suit everyone.

744
00:48:27,075 --> 00:48:28,284

You are too hasty, sir. You forget
that I have given no answer.

I must add that Lady Catherine
will thoroughly approve

Well, Lizzie, from this day onward,

797
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,107
you must be a stranger to one of your parents.

798
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,984
Who will maintain you when your father is dead?

799
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:15,780
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

800
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,616
and I will never see you again if you do.

801
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,118
- Mr Bennet!
- Thank you, Papa.

802
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:29,584
Ungrateful child.
I shall never speak to you again!

803
00:51:30,377 --> 00:51:33,046
MRS BENNET: Not that I take
much pleasure in talking.

804
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:36,883
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

805
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:39,552
can have no pleasure in talking to anybody.

(SHUSHING)

808
00:51:45,017 --> 00:51:46,559
What's the matter?

809
00:51:48,354 --> 00:51:49,395
Jane?

810
00:52:44,116 --> 00:52:47,493
I don't understand what would
take him from Netherfield.

811
00:52:47,661 --> 00:52:49,620
Why would he not know when he was to return?

812
00:52:49,705 --> 00:52:50,913
Read it. I don't mind.

813
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,383
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister,

814
00:53:02,467 --> 00:53:04,927
"and we are scarcely less eager
to meet her again.

815
00:53:05,012 --> 00:53:06,721
"I really do not think Georgiana Darcy

816
00:53:06,805 --> 00:53:09,390
"has her equal for beauty, elegance,
and accomplishments,

817
00:53:09,474 --> 00:53:12,100
"so much so I must hope
to hereafter call her my sister."

818
00:53:12,184 --> 00:53:14,269
Is that not clear enough?

819
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:17,772
Caroline sees that her brother
is in love with you

820
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:20,609
and has taken him off to persuade him otherwise.

821
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:24,446
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

822
00:53:25,781 --> 00:53:27,949
It's far more likely that he doesn't
love me and never has.

823
00:53:28,034 --> 00:53:30,493
He loves you, Jane. Do not give up.

824
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,956
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

825
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:38,960
let it be known you are there,
and I am sure he will come to you.

826
00:53:48,678 --> 00:53:52,848
Give my love to my sister
and try not to be a burden, dear.

827
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:55,059
Poor Jane.

828
00:53:55,727 --> 00:53:59,355
Still, a girl likes to be
crossed in love now and then.

829
00:54:00,315 --> 00:54:02,399
It gives her something to think of,

830
00:54:02,484 --> 00:54:05,736
and a sort of distinction
amongst her companions.

831
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:07,529
I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.

832
00:54:07,614 --> 00:54:09,823
Well, it's your turn now, Lizzie.

833
00:54:09,908 --> 00:54:11,992
You turned down Collins.

834
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,120
You're free to go off and be jilted yourself.

835
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:18,374
What about Mr Wickham?

836
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:20,917
Well, he's a pleasant fellow
and he'd do the job credibly.

837
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:22,043
Father.

838
00:54:22,127 --> 00:54:24,796
And you have an affectionate mother,

839
00:54:25,047 --> 00:54:27,215
who would make the most of it.

Mr Collins and I are engaged.

- Engaged?
- Yes.

To be married?

Yes, of course, Lizzie,
what other kind of engaged is there?

Oh, for heaven's sake, Lizzie,
don't look at me like that.

There was no earthly reason

why I shouldn't be as happy with him
as any other.

- But he's ridiculous.
- Oh, hush.

Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

I've no money and no prospects.

I'm already a burden to my parents.

I must confess, the view from
where I sit has been rather grey.

Yes, my youngest is not 16.

on younger sisters

It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.

Upon my word,

956
01:01:58,529 --> 01:02:01,489
you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person.

Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

No, I beg you.

964

For music is my delight.

965
01:02:26,432 --> 01:02:28,766
In fact there are few people in England

966
01:02:28,851 --> 01:02:32,185
who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself,

If I had ever learnt,

I should have been a great proficient.

- She plays very well.
- LADY CATHERINE: I hope she practices.

No excellence can be acquired

Though you have no instrument of your own,

you're very welcome to come to Rosings

Oh, I thank you, Your Ladyship.

You'll be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.

987
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:48,343
You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy,

by coming in all your state to hear me,

if your sister does play so well.

I'm well enough acquainted with you,

01:03:56,769 --> 01:04:00,021
to know that I cannot alarm you
even should I wish it.

he danced with nobody at all.

some counsellor

to whom it may apply
for consolation in distress.

There are many conveniences
which others can supply

I'm at his disposal.

Everyone appears to be at his disposal.

I wonder he doesn't marry and secure
a lasting convenience of that kind.

he recently came to the rescue
of one of his friends just in time.

What happened?

1045

He saved the man from an imprudent marriage.

His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

01:07:54,624 --> 01:07:57,668
There were apparently strong
objections to the lady.

1050
01:07:58,128 --> 01:08:00,004
What kind of objections?

1051
01:08:00,297 --> 01:08:01,505
Her lack of fortune?

1052
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:05,050
I think it was her family
that was considered unsuitable.

So he separated them.

and I am very sorry to have caused you pain.

Believe me, it was unconsciously done.

- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

1076

Are you laughing at me?

- No.
- Are you rejecting me?

I'm sure that the feelings which,
as you've told me,

have hindered your regard
will help you in overcoming it.

Might I ask why,

with so little endeavour at civility,
I am thus repulsed?

with so evident a design of insulting me,

1084
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,649
you chose to tell me that you liked me

If I was uncivil, then that is some excuse!

But I have other reasons.
You know I have.

What reasons?

1089

Do you think that anything might
tempt me to accept the man

1090
01:09:55,617 --> 01:09:57,034
who has ruined, perhaps forever,

Do you deny it, Mr Darcy?

1093
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:05,458
That you separated a young couple
who loved each other,

1094
01:10:05,543 --> 01:10:07,836
exposing your friend to the centre
of the world for caprice

and my sister to its derision
for disappointed hopes.

And involving them both in misery
of the acutest kind?

01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:14,759
I do not deny it.

01:10:15,595 --> 01:10:16,553
How could you do it?

1099
01:10:16,637 --> 01:10:18,430
Because I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

1100
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:19,556
Indifferent?

1101
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,724
I watched them most carefully

1102
01:10:20,808 --> 01:10:22,309
and realise his attachment was deeper than hers.

1103
01:10:22,393 --> 01:10:23,393
That's because she's shy.

1104
01:10:23,477 --> 01:10:24,477
Bingley, too, is modest

1105
01:10:24,562 --> 01:10:26,104
and was persuaded
she didn't feel strongly for him.

1106
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,231
- Because you suggested it.
- I did it for his own good.

1107
01:10:28,316 --> 01:10:31,359
My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me!

1108
01:10:35,823 --> 01:10:39,074
I suppose you suspect
that his fortune had some bearing...

1109
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:40,659
No! I wouldn't do your sister
the dishonour!

1110
01:10:40,744 --> 01:10:43,287
- Though it was suggested...
- What was?

1111
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,789
It was made perfectly clear

No. There was, however,

I have to admit, the matter of your family.

for your behaviour towards him?

in that gentleman's concerns.

Oh, yes, his misfortunes
have been very great indeed.

You ruin his chances,

but if I may, I will address the two
of fences you have laid against me.

1152
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,899
My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.

1153
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:51,153
In consequence he left him a generous living.

1154
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:53,196
But upon my father's death, Mr Wickham

1155
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:56,408
announced he had no intention of taking orders.

1156
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,953
He demanded the value of the living
which he was given

1157
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,664
and which he gambled away within weeks.

1158
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:08,670
He then wrote demanding more money,
which I refused,

1159
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,423
after which he severed all acquaintance.

1160
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,134
He came back to see us last summer,

1161
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,803
at which point he declared
passionate love for my sister

1162
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:19,722
whom he tried to persuade to elope with him.

1163
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:23,184
She is to inherit £30,000.

1164
01:15:24,227 --> 01:15:25,519
When it was made clear

1165
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,563
he would never receive a penny
of that inheritance,

1166

he disappeared.

01:56:51,891 --> 01:56:55,561
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

1737
01:56:56,146 --> 01:56:57,521
None at all.

1738
01:56:58,398 --> 01:57:02,359
Well, we all know him to be a proud,
unpleasant sort of fellow,

1739
01:57:03,903 --> 01:57:05,946
but this would be nothing
if you really liked him.

1740
01:57:06,031 --> 01:57:07,781
- I do like him.
- Well.

1741
01:57:10,035 --> 01:57:11,368
I love him.

1742
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:19,834
He's not proud. I was wrong,
I was entirely wrong about him.

1743
01:57:23,047 --> 01:57:24,130
You don't know him, Papa.

1744
01:57:24,214 --> 01:57:27,759
If I told you what he was
really like, what he's done.

1745
01:57:28,802 --> 01:57:30,386
What has he done?

1746
01:57:31,388 --> 01:57:32,722
(HENS CLUCKING)

1747
01:57:33,057 --> 01:57:34,891
KITTY: Mary, look at him.

1748
01:57:38,562 --> 01:57:39,520
But he's so...

1749
01:57:39,605 --> 01:57:42,982
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

1750
01:57:43,067 --> 01:57:45,068
So did I. So did we all.

1751
01:57:46,570 --> 01:57:48,529
We must have been wrong.

1752
01:57:49,489 --> 01:57:51,239
Wouldn't be the first time, will it?

1753
01:57:51,324 --> 01:57:52,324
(LAUGHING) No.

1754
01:57:52,784 --> 01:57:54,785
Nor the last, I dare say.

1755
01:58:00,583 --> 01:58:01,917
Good Lord.

1756
01:58:04,921 --> 01:58:07,589
- I must pay him back.
- No.

1757
01:58:08,925 --> 01:58:11,885
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

1758
01:58:13,471 --> 01:58:16,014
We misjudged him, Papa, me more than anyone,

1759
01:58:16,599 --> 01:58:19,267
in every way, not just in this matter.

1760
01:58:20,853 --> 01:58:22,729
I've been nonsensical.

1761
01:58:23,773 --> 01:58:27,108
But he's been a fool about Jane,

1762
01:58:27,401 --> 01:58:29,527
about so many other things.

1763
01:58:31,279 --> 01:58:32,488
But then, so have I.

1764
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:38,202
You see, he and I are...

1765
01:58:40,455 --> 01:58:42,415
He and I are so similar.

1766
01:58:43,959 --> 01:58:45,876
(LAUGHING) We're both so stubborn.

1767
01:58:48,839 --> 01:58:50,131
Papa, I...

1768
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:51,507
(BENNET LAUGHING)

1769
01:58:54,344 --> 01:58:56,637
You really do love him, don't you?

1770
01:58:58,140 --> 01:58:59,431
Very much.

1771
01:59:02,852 --> 01:59:03,852
(SIGHING)

1772
01:59:04,854 --> 01:59:09,107
I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you,

1773
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:13,695
but it seems I am overruled.

1774
01:59:15,489 --> 01:59:19,325
So I heartily give my consent.

1775
01:59:28,252 --> 01:59:30,837
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie,

1776
01:59:31,464 --> 01:59:33,006
to anyone less worthy.

1777
01:59:36,176 --> 01:59:38,010
Thank you.

1778
01:59:47,771 --> 01:59:48,771
(CHUCKLING)

1779
01:59:51,608 --> 01:59:53,650
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,

1780
01:59:53,735 --> 01:59:57,946
for heaven's sake, send them in,
I'm quite at my leisure.

1781
02:00:21,013 --> 02:00:22,848
How are you this
evening, my dear?

1782
02:00:22,931 --> 02:00:24,224
Very well.

1783
02:00:24,308 --> 02:00:25,851
Only I wish you would not
call me "my dear".

1784
02:00:25,934 --> 02:00:26,894
Why?

1785
02:00:26,977 --> 02:00:28,979
'Cause it's what my father
always calls my mother

1786
02:00:29,062 --> 02:00:30,397
when he's cross
about something.

1787
02:00:30,481 --> 02:00:31,857
What endearments
am I allowed?

1788
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:33,400
Well, let me think.

1789
02:00:33,650 --> 02:00:35,277
Lizzie, for everyday.

1790
02:00:35,986 --> 02:00:38,489
My pearl, for Sundays.

1791
02:00:39,323 --> 02:00:42,493
And Goddess Divine, but only
on very special occasions.

1792
02:00:43,952 --> 02:00:46,997
And what shall I call you
when I'm cross?

1793
02:00:48,332 --> 02:00:49,666
Mrs. Darcy?

1794
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:51,960
No. No.

1795
02:00:53,003 --> 02:00:55,130
You may only call me
Mrs. Darcy

1796
02:00:56,173 --> 02:00:58,175
when you are completely

1797
02:00:58,342 --> 02:01:01,428
and perfectly,
and incandescently happy.

1798
02:01:05,015 --> 02:01:08,811
And how are you this
evening, Mrs. Darcy?

1799
02:01:18,195 --> 02:01:34,711
Mrs. Darcy.
