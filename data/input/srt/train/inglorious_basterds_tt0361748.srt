Well, sir, such as they are,

01:05:20,258 --> 01:05:24,803
I write reviews and articles for a
publication called Films and Filmmakers,

Lieutenant. What are their titles?

512
01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:32,311
The first book was called

513

Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.

And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

It's a sub textual film criticism study

Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?

Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three years,

523

a knowledge of the German film industry

under the Third Reich. Explain
to me UFA under Goebbels.

Goebbels considers the films he's making

to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema.

Frightfully sorry, sir. Once again?

535
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:50,889
You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.

536
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:54,893
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,

Quite well, actually.

in Germany over the last eight years.

But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.
