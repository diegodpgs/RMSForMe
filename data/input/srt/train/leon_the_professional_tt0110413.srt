1
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,712
Okay.

2
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,049
Let's talk business.

3
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,345
This fat bastard is trying to
move in on Maurizio's business.

4
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,097
Now, you know Maurizio is a reasonable guy.

5
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,392
He just wants a little conversation.

6
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,979
But this guy, he don't want to hear about it.

7
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,648
Maybe he'll listen to you.

8
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:32,109
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

9
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,781
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

10
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,633
Nice to see you again, Mr. Jones.

11
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,025
Remember, neatness counts.
You got one half hour.

12
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,286
One hour.

13
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,924
Yeah, what?

14
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:41,929
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy who wants to talk to you.

15
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,183
What's he look like?

16
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,353
Serious.

17
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,690
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

18
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,988
Somebody's coming up. Somebody serious.

19
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,495
Mickey, open your eyes. We got company.

20
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,916
We got company.

21
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,847
Come on.

22
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,524
Stop, stop, man!

23
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,699
Tonto.

24
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,455
Tell the driver to wait for us out back,
and hurry up.

25
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,879
- Hey, sweetie, what's going on?
- Don't worry, baby.

26
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,923
It's cool. Take a nap.

27
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,693
Oh, my God.

28
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,821
Those fuckers blocked both the exits.

29
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,661
Check the terrace!

30
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,969
Hey! Yo!

31
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,694
- 911, Emergency.
- I need help.

32
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,614
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- All right. Just stay on the line.

33
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,699
I'll just be off a moment.

34
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,078
- Sir, I'm gonna connect you with an officer.
- Okay.

35
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,640
Detective Jefferson. May I help you?

36
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,809
I'll call you back.

37
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,276
Hey, relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases over here.

38
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,654
Ain't even cut yet.
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

39
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,411
Dial this number.

40
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,468
I'll talk to you later, sweetie, okay?

41
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,013
Bye.

42
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,145
- Hello?
- It's Maurizio. Remember me?

43
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:45,482
- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. I mean, no.

44
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,027
Just for today.

45
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,238
So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town

46
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,074
and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.

47
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,993
Yeah. Right.

48
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,288
Let me speak to our mutual friend.

49
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,459
He wants to talk to you.

50
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,758
- Yes?
- Make sure he understands,

51
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,760
then let him go.

52
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,187
Do you understand?

53
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,650
- So say it.
- I understand.

54
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,320
Good.

55
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,889
Jesus.

56
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,360
Two milk as usual?

57
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,260
Hi.

58
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,475
Why did you hide the cigarette?

59
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,186
This building's full of rats.

60
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,939
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

61
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,951
What happened?

62
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,454
I fell off my bike.

63
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,216
Hey.

64
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,929
Don't tell my dad about the cigarette, okay?

65
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,069
- ...why you're doing this to us.
- I don't know...

66
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,738
Funny how people got memory problems
these days. I mean, it must be the sun.

67
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,907
You know, a man should know
when to come out of the sun.

68
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,992
I don't know how it happened.
I mean, what's my job?

69
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm just a holder.
I hold the stuff just like you give it to me.

70
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,872
I don't look at it, I don't touch it.
I don't even know how to cut it.

71
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,333
Try and follow me, all right?
In June, we gave you the dope.

72
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,962
It tests 100% pure.
Now it's July, we pick up the dope,

73
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,505
and it tests 90% pure.

74
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,883
Now, somewhere between June and July,
10% turned to cut!

75
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,760
I don't know. It's none of my business.
I'm just a holder.

76
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,304
You give me the stuff, I hold the stuff.
That's all I know.

77
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,932
Hey, look, you know,
I'm trying to help you out here,

78
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,768
but, you know, if you're gonna
be a hard-ass about it...

79
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,645
I gotta disturb him.

80
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,608
Now, let me tell you, when he's into
his music, he hates being disturbed.

81
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,528
I'm telling you the truth.

82
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,532
I hope so, because he's got a talent
for sniffing out a lie.

83
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,492
It's scary.

84
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,453
It's almost like a sixth sense.

85
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,875
Are you gonna change your tune
or I got to bust into his?

86
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,838
I'm telling you the truth.

87
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,722
All right.

88
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,517
Stan. Stan.

89
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,649
I'm sorry.
See, he said he didn't cut the dope.

90
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,235
Of course he didn't.

91
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:35,123
Just do me a favor.
Find out who did by tomorrow.

92
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,251
Noon.

93
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,597
Malky, hey, wait.

94
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,809
Hey, I didn't cut your shit.

95
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,270
Find out yourself!

96
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,568
What the hell are you doing out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

97
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,487
- I did it already.
- Oh, yeah? Well, you can get inside

98
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,739
and help your sister
clean up the goddamn house!

99
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,950
And stop smoking cigarettes!

100
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:00,936
One!

101
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,561
One!

102
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,314
Two. Take a deep breath in.

103
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,900
Take a deep breath out.

104
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,821
- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.

105
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,156
Change the channel,
and I'll smash your face.

106
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,742
So ready for the legs. And down.

107
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,619
Down! Down!

108
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,755
Sorry, sweetheart.

109
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,466
Squeeze. Release.

110
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,969
Good morning, sweetie.

111
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,596
Hi, honey.

112
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,351
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

113
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,061
She took my turn.

114
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,313
She just wants to watch
these goddamn cartoons!

115
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,940
It wouldn't hurt her to move her ass a bit.

116
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,401
I'm not the one with a fat ass around here.

117
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,986
Two and up.

118
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,989
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons

119
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,533
move a little ass and go get some food?

120
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,787
- Legs. Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.

121
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,713
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

122
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,590
I mean, you always come up
with something, right?

123
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:15,343
Yeah. I think I went a little too far this time.

124
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,930
I think you're going a little too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

125
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,433
What about working at home today?

126
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,271
Really feel it. That's it, stomach in.

127
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,775
- One...
- Now it's my turn!

128
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,403
Shit! She's gonna hit me!

129
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,615
- Daddy, she's...
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

130
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,451
Please don't shoot!

131
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,787
Fucking bitch.

132
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,375
- Megatron! Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.

133
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,797
When you use your quadriceps, your thigh
muscles have warmed up your body...

134
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,926
- Hey, can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

135
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,976
- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister,

136
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,730
headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.

137
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,566
Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?

138
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,738
Yes, this is she.

139
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,617
Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer,

140
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,953
he told us she had "problems."

141
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,622
Well, as you know, we pride ourselves
in turning troubled girls

142
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,832
into healthy, productive young women.

143
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,835
But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.

144
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,172
Now, Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.

145
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,133
I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year,

146
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:41,346
but if you will refer to Page 20 in the rules
and regulations manual we sent you,

147
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,350
you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence,

148
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,644
your tuition will be forfeit.

149
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,771
She's dead.

150
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,879
Tell that fucking kid to do
a little work around here!

151
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,550
Clean up! I'm tired of this fucking mess.

152
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,343
Hurry up!

153
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,808
Taxi!

154
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,246
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

155
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,127
Always like this.

156
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,010
Keep it.

157
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:55,146
Hey, I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

158
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,900
One quart or two? It's two, right?

159
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,423
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

160
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,803
It reminds me of Beethoven.

161
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,393
Can you hear it?

162
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,856
It's like when you put your head
to the grass,

163
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,276
you can hear it growing.

164
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,362
You can hear the insects.

165
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,412
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

166
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,456
I'm gonna play you some.

167
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,212
Daddy!

168
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,058
Benny, stay here.

169
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,900
Daddy! Daddy!

170
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,268
We said noon.

171
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,608
I've got one minute past.

172
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,322
You don't like Beethoven.

173
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,909
You don't know what you're missing.

174
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,329
Overtures like that get my juices flowing.

175
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,873
So powerful.

176
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,919
But after his openings, to be honest,

177
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:50,298
he does tend to get a little fucking boring.

178
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,511
That's why I stopped!

179
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,809
Toss the apartment.

180
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,084
You're a Mozart fan. I love him, too.

181
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,420
I love Mozart!

182
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,053
He was Austrian, you know.

183
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,765
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

184
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,310
So I tend to go for the heavier guys.

185
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,314
- Cool.
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

186
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,900
Man, keep your bumbaclot mouth shut.

187
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,195
Check out Brahms. He's good, too.

188
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,449
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man, knock it off!

189
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,632
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

190
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,843
Wow.

191
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,741
Fuck!

192
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,159
Stan.

193
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,914
Jesus. Look what you did.

194
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,250
- Stan, you all right? Stan.
- Look what you did!

195
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,463
Stan!

196
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,229
Hey, Stan, what are you doing?

197
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,731
What are you doing? He's dead!

198
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,650
But he ruined my suit.

199
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,903
Yeah, I know, but he's dead.

200
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,198
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

201
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,075
I'm calm.

202
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,411
- Stay there, all right?
- Okay.

203
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:13,209
Benny! Benny!

204
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:19,340
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

205
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,719
Take it easy, all right?

206
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,098
Benny!

207
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,310
Come on, let's get a cigarette, all right?

208
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,938
Benny, we're coming out!

209
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,692
Benny, don't fire! Get in there!

210
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,238
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

211
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,408
- You wear something new and...
- You got a light?

212
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,995
Take it easy. Stay out there.

213
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,289
What's happening out there?

214
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,499
It's all right, ma'am. Go in. DEA. Police.

215
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,793
Why don't you leave that poor family alone?

216
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:59,797
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

217
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,425
Why don't you leave them alone?

218
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,721
He said go back inside.

219
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,228
Stan, I think it's better if we go inside,
all right?

220
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:36,083
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

221
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:40,922
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a four-year-old kid!

222
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,925
Did you really have to do that?

223
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,733
Please open the door.

224
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,115
Please.

225
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,540
Please.

226
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,293
Benny, there are three kids here.

227
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,421
I think Stan killed this girl.

228
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,215
And Willy, that asshole, shot the little boy.

229
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,759
The third one's missing. Find her.

230
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,855
Shit. Hey, we missed a little girl, man.

231
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,942
I'm gonna try to find the fucking super
in this goddamn building.

232
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:55,056
- Don't you recognize me?
- Me, Grimlock. Know you!

233
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,400
Shit.

234
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,739
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

235
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,492
- Stan, they found it.
- I know.

236
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,911
There it is.

237
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,289
There's cops outside. We better go.

238
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,626
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

239
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,090
What do you want me to tell them?

240
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,228
Tell them we were doing

241
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,564
our job.

242
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,160
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

243
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,461
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it

244
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:11,173
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.

245
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,553
- Your mother, she...
- She's not my mother.

246
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:21,142
My sister, she wanted to lose some weight
anyway. Bet she never looked better.

247
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,645
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

248
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,689
Not a good half at that.

249
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,034
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

250
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,412
Because they killed my brother.

251
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:45,708
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

252
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,586
He never used to cry.

253
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,547
He just used to sit next to me and cuddle.

254
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:57,761
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

255
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:02,349
Hey, don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually much nicer than people.

256
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,477
But they smell like shit.

257
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,855
Not true.

258
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,776
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen,

259
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,778
that's very clean,

260
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,657
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

261
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,286
Yes, I do.

262
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,539
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamn pig.

263
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,250
Don't move. I'll get him.

264
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,214
Piggy, Piggy, where are you?

265
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,008
There you are.

266
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,559
Hi, Mathilda.

267
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,062
Hi, Piggy.

268
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,073
How are you today?

269
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,117
I've seen better days.

270
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,796
- What's your name?
- Leon.

271
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,926
Cute name.

272
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,894
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

273
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,576
I'm gonna get some more milk.

274
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,470
Holy shit.

275
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,812
Don't touch that, please.

276
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,399
Leon, what exactly do you do for a living?

277
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,319
Cleaner.

278
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,324
- You mean you're a hit man?
- Yeah.

279
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:26,827
Cool.

280
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:43,510
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women, no kids. That's the rules.

281
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,139
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirtbags

282
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,099
who killed my brother?

283
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,519
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

284
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,650
How about this? I work for you,

285
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:01,362
and in exchange,
you teach me how to clean?

286
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,740
What do you think?

287
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,992
I'll clean your place. I'll do the shopping.

288
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,203
I'll even wash your clothes.

289
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,458
- Is it a deal?
- No, it's not a deal.

290
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:26,845
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

291
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,891
You've had a rough day today.

292
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:37,147
Go to sleep, and we'll see tomorrow. Okay?

293
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,164
You've been really great with me, Leon,

294
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,500
and it's not always like that.

295
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,711
You know?

296
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,637
Good night.

297
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,842
Sleep well? Good.

298
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,844
Because after breakfast you got to take off.

299
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,930
- Where to?
- Not my problem.

300
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,031
Read it.

301
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,581
You don't know how to read.

302
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,584
I'm learning, but I've had a lot of work lately,

303
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,420
so I'm a little behind.

304
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,256
What's it say?

305
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,134
I've decided what to do with my life.
I want to be a cleaner.

306
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:16,431
You want to be a cleaner. Here. Take it.

307
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,769
It's a goodbye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

308
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:24,314
- I work alone. Understand? Alone.
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

309
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:28,151
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
And they were the best.

310
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,865
Mathilda, why are you doing this to me?

311
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,826
I've been nothing but nice to you.

312
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,329
I even saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

313
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,165
Right. So now you're responsible for it.

314
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,169
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

315
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,006
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door,

316
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,175
like you let me die right there in front of it.

317
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,929
But you did open it. So...

318
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,850
Mathilda...

319
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:04,104
If you don't help me, I'll die tonight.
I can feel it.

320
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,482
Now, I don't want to die tonight.

321
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,528
Mathilda, you're just a little girl.

322
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,240
So don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

323
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,658
I'm sorry.

324
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,095
How's that?

325
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,586
Mathilda.

326
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:14,466
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

327
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,135
- You got that?
- Okay.

328
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,305
I don't work like that. It's not professional.

329
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,392
- There is rules.
- Okay.

330
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,561
And stop saying "okay" all the time, okay?

331
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:28,981
Okay.

332
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,774
Good.

333
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:44,955
Hi.

334
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,376
You expect to use that in this hotel?

335
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,588
Mister, I have to use it,

336
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:57,718
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month

337
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,178
and I have to practice.

338
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,807
Okay, okay, okay, but not after 10:00.

339
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,727
- Okay, I promise.
- All right.

340
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,772
I'll put you at the end of the hall,

341
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,984
so that you don't disturb anyone.

342
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,320
And would you fill those out, please?

343
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:26,121
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
You know how I like to check in to hotels.

344
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,461
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

345
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,422
- Fourth floor!
- Thanks, mister!

346
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:40,218
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

347
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,765
I have a kid, 17, does nothing all day long.

348
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,274
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

349
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,776
Of course.

350
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,158
Hi.

351
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,966
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

352
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:25,263
If things get hot, she'll take the heat.

353
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,993
- There. Finished.
- How old are you?

354
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,622
- 18.
- 18?

355
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,376
- Want to see my license?
- No.

356
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:59,506
- Just look a little younger.
- Thanks.

357
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,017
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

358
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:15,188
- I want to be strong like you, smart like you.
- Mathilda.

359
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,691
I know I'm not strong enough yet,

360
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,695
but I could learn the basics, the theory.

361
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,448
What do you think? Just the theory.

362
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,077
I need this, Leon.

363
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,789
I need time to get my head together.

364
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,457
Yeah, and I need

365
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,133
a drink.

366
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,261
Don't move. I'll go get one.

367
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,664
You know, when you told me
to get this baby out for you,

368
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,917
I thought my hearing's going.

369
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,504
I says to myself, "Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners."

370
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,840
I like to stay in shape.

371
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:27,385
Sure. Always stay on top.

372
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,473
It's like me. I got to know
where everything is all the time.

373
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:35,810
That's why I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

374
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,982
Change ain't good, Leon. You know?

375
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,237
Yeah.

376
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,328
Check it.

377
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,624
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

378
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,795
One thing's got nothing to do with the other.
Remember that, Leon.

379
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,672
I will.

380
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:22,148
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use,

381
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:25,694
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

382
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,196
The closer you get to being a pro,

383
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,865
the closer you can get to the client.

384
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,995
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

385
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,124
- Okay?
- Okay.

386
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,210
Position.

387
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,191
No.

388
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:10,113
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

389
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:13,366
They can see you coming from a mile away.

390
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,494
And always dress down.

391
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,082
- Never brighter than the floor, okay?
- Okay.

392
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,755
Let's practice now. It's the best way to learn.

393
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,967
- Who should I hit?
- Whoever.

394
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,060
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes.

395
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,686
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
You guys in the suits get lost.

396
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,521
I don't want to see you, all right?

397
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:46,900
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.

398
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,204
- No women, no kids, right?
- Right.

399
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:10,256
- Jogger in the yellow and orange?
- Okay.

400
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,720
Keep calm.

401
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,268
Don't take your eyes off him.

402
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,438
Breathe easy.

403
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,150
Watch his movement.

404
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,780
Pretend you're running with him.

405
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,953
Try to feel his next movement.

406
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,832
Take a deep breath. Hold it.

407
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,511
- Now.
- Oh, my God!

408
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,596
- Get down!
- I'm all right. I'm fine. I'm fine.

409
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,890
Get down! Get down!
Where'd that come from?

410
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,851
One shot. Not bad, huh?

411
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,563
What the hell? I'm fine.
I just can't breathe! Get off of me.

412
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,649
- Stay down!
- Can we try with real bullets now?

413
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,819
Not today. Let's pack up.

414
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,996
They go like that.

415
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,291
Here. After...

416
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,875
- No, thanks.
- No discussion.

417
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,293
"It seemed

418
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,880
"to Socrates..."

419
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,427
"To Socrates..."

420
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,390
I'll do it.

421
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,948
Leon, all we do is work.

422
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,451
We need a break. Let's play a game.

423
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,372
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

424
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:33,710
It makes you think and it helps your memory.
It's exactly what you need.

425
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,297
Okay.

426
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,891
Like a virgin

427
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,979
Touched for the very first time

428
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:56,816
Like a virgin

429
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,737
- Okay, who is it?
- I don't know.

430
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,489
Okay.

431
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,752
Happy birthday to you

432
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:21,174
Happy birthday, Mr. President

433
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,967
I don't know.

434
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,020
Moustache.

435
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,274
No.

436
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:41,861
I'm singing in the rain

437
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,822
Just singing in the rain

438
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,449
What a...

439
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,533
Gene Kelly?

440
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,038
Good. Your turn now.

441
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,630
Okay, pilgrim.

442
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,052
Clint Eastwood?

443
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,562
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

444
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,651
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

445
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,694
Leon, really brilliant.

446
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:27,740
Amazing.

447
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,759
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.

448
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,513
Always happy. No questions.

449
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,892
It's like me, you see.

450
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:57,728
No roots.

451
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:01,023
If you really love it, you should
plant it in the middle of a park,

452
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,151
so that it can have roots.

453
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,237
Yeah.

454
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:10,032
I'm the one you should be watering
if you want me to grow.

455
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,910
You're right.

456
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,503
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

457
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,173
Wait! Stop!

458
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:37,185
Stop. Stop!

459
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:44,025
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

460
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,161
It's been a long time, Leon.

461
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,919
I missed you.

462
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:07,381
- And you missed some nice jobs, too.
- Been training.

463
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,844
Training's good, but don't overdo it.

464
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,014
You know, training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

465
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,224
Tony.

466
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:23,564
All the money I make, that you keep for me...

467
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,943
- You need some money?
- No. Just curious.

468
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:32,323
Because I've been working a long time
and I haven't done anything with my money.

469
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:40,289
I thought maybe someday I could use it.

470
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,918
You met a woman.

471
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,508
Leon.

472
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,721
Leon, you got to be careful with women.

473
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,140
Remember when you arrived
in this country, Leon?

474
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:02,270
When I took you in, you were still
wet behind the fucking ears,

475
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,690
and already you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

476
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:09,110
- Don't forget that, Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

477
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,241
You know, about my money,

478
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,995
maybe I could give

479
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,455
a little

480
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,042
to someone.

481
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,671
You know, to help out.

482
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:35,511
Hey, it's your money. I mean, I'm just
holding it for you, you know, like a bank.

483
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,763
Except, you know, better than a bank,

484
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,057
because, you know,
banks always get knocked off.

485
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,476
You know, no one knocks off old Tony.

486
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:44,604
And besides, with a bank,

487
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:48,608
there's always tons of forms to be filled
and all that shit.

488
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:53,779
But old Tony, nothing to read,
nothing to write. It's all in his head.

489
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,741
I know how to read now.

490
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:02,622
That's good, Leon. Good.

491
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:09,545
Your money's here. Whenever you want it,
you just ask me. Okay?

492
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,089
- Here's a grand. No, no. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

493
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,966
- Come on. Take it. Have some fun.
- No.

494
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,385
- Go ahead. Take it.
- Thank you.

495
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:21,223
All right. Now let's talk business.

496
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,768
Don't move. I'll go get the file.

497
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,189
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

498
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:54,840
Listen, Mathilda, you better be careful.

499
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:58,010
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

500
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:01,722
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

501
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,809
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

502
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,354
I want you to stop cursing.

503
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,856
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

504
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,776
I want you to make an effort to talk nice.

505
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,737
Okay.

506
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,867
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

507
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,204
Okay.

508
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,377
Stay away from him. He looks like a weirdo.

509
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:34,880
Okay.

510
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,844
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

511
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,638
Okay.

512
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:57,570
Leon, I think I'm kind of
falling in love with you.

513
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:03,284
It's the first time for me, you know.

514
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,912
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

515
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,457
'Cause I feel it.

516
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,251
Where?

517
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,006
In my stomach.

518
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,218
It's all warm.

519
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:28,601
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.

520
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,733
Mathilda, I'm glad you don't
have a stomach ache anymore.

521
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,320
I don't think it means anything.

522
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:43,032
I'm late for work. I hate being late for work.

523
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,995
Hey. How's the practicing going?

524
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:04,822
- And how are we today, miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

525
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,365
Yeah, I understand.

526
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,951
But you're doing all right.

527
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,245
I haven't received any complaints at all.

528
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,457
Well, I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

529
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:18,460
That's very smart.

530
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,046
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

531
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,758
What exactly does your father do?

532
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,889
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

533
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,142
Except he's not really my father.

534
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,858
He's my lover.

535
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,655
Think I'll go for a walk.

536
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:06,175
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

537
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,678
- Hey, where are you going?
- Visiting friends at 6J.

538
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,056
Okay. Go ahead. So, what about Saturday?

539
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,892
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.

540
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,769
You got plans?

541
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:26,946
I'll meet you here?

542
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:45,566
We know you're a busy man, and
we'll try to make this as short as possible.

543
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:49,403
Now, if you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

544
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:52,406
The guy was here. He went for his gun.

545
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,366
Bang, we shot him.

546
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,956
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!

547
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,625
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

548
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,045
But in your statement
you said you were the first man in.

549
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,963
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

550
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:10,966
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

551
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:15,721
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

552
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,264
Cooperation.

553
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:25,230
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

554
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:29,651
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, Room 4602.

555
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,791
- Kids should be at school.
- Hey.

556
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,627
- Hey.
- Hey. Come on, that's my ball!

557
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:51,131
Hey, give that back.
Come on, where you going?

558
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,676
Damn! Where you going, man?
That's my ball!

559
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:03,811
Follow the blue car.

560
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,855
And I suppose you want me to blast
the music and go through the lights?

561
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,857
No, you're gonna drive slowly.

562
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,401
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up, okay?

563
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:47,563
I do not want to fight you,
but you leave me no choice.

564
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:53,485
Boss, you just gave me a great idea!

565
01:07:58,283 --> 01:07:59,825
But I mean a big one!

566
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,785
Welcome back to E! News Daily,

567
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,830
our 30-minute look at the latest
in entertainment news.

568
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,081
I'm Bianca Ferrar.

569
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,548
It's for you. A present.

570
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,053
Do you want me to open it? I'll open it.

571
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:27,561
How do you like it? Nice, eh?

572
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,023
Mr. McGuffin?

573
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,195
Can I have a word with you?

574
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:59,403
Here. It's for a contract. Twenty grand, right?

575
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:02,281
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in Room 4602

576
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:05,033
in the DEA building, 26 Federal Plaza.

577
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:08,620
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

578
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,707
- Too heavy.
- Well...

579
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,167
Would you rent me your gear for the day?

580
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,253
I never lend out my gear.

581
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:20,549
But you still have your gun. Use it.

582
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:24,011
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window. Okay?

583
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:26,221
Why are you so mean to me?

584
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,767
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about.

585
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:34,104
But you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

586
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,816
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

587
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,111
- It's better to forget.
- To forget?

588
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,156
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor,

589
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,241
you expect me to forget?

590
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:48,910
I want to kill those sons of bitches.

591
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,662
I'm gonna blow their fucking heads off.

592
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,707
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

593
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,836
Your life is changed forever.

594
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:04,051
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

595
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,803
I don't give a shit about sleeping, Leon.

596
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,682
I want love or death.

597
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,478
That's it.

598
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:17,898
Love or death.

599
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,486
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

600
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,492
There's a really great game, Leon.

601
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:31,370
Makes people nicer. Starts them thinking.

602
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,335
The kind of game you love.

603
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:56,144
If I win, you keep me with you for life.

604
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,690
And if you lose?

605
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:03,193
Go shopping alone, like before.

606
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,407
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

607
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:13,161
There's a round in the chamber. I heard it.

608
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,496
So what?

609
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,749
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

610
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,711
Nothing.

611
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,634
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

612
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:33,140
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

613
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:40,439
Because if there is
just a little bit of love in you for me,

614
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:47,320
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

615
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,248
I love you, Leon.

616
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,766
I win.

617
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,620
I took a hit.

618
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,581
I need a hand now.

619
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:43,251
I know she's young, but she learns fast.

620
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,796
Kids need to be shaped
into something, right?

621
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:50,258
Yeah, I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

622
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,969
- She's 18.
- Really?

623
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,851
How about something to drink, Tony?

624
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:03,146
Yeah, sure. Manolo, glass of milk for Leon.

625
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,067
Nice tattoo.

626
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,824
Manolo, make that two.

627
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,847
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

628
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,976
First you find out where the chain is.

629
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:44,062
You can't see it, but you can feel it. Here.

630
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:47,399
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?

631
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:49,985
Whatever you want.

632
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,239
- Yes?
- Hi.

633
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:55,949
It's Susan.

634
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,994
I'm sorry.
You must have the wrong door, little girl.

635
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,829
I don't know any Susan.

636
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,916
Move back a little. I can't see anything.

637
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,586
The light's out.

638
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,172
It's all dark out here.

639
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:16,177
Mister, I'm scared.

640
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,389
Okay. Okay.

641
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,103
What the fuck are you doing?

642
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,485
Open up.

643
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:37,198
If it leaves your mouth, I'll pull the trigger.

644
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:18,406
Here's okay. Let it go. I said let it go.

645
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,493
Move. Move over.

646
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:24,746
Easy. Easy.

647
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:27,666
Easy. Careful. You want me...

648
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,087
Go ahead. Your turn.

649
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,388
Help me. Please don't beat me.

650
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:44,516
Sir? Sir?

651
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,354
Sir? Sir, it's not my dope.

652
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:51,773
Sir, look I...

653
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,733
A little left, please.

654
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:58,780
Before... Please...

655
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,201
Okay. Now, the security shot.

656
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,001
No, the second goes higher on the chest.

657
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:14,337
Aim for the heart and lungs.

658
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,715
There. Right there. You see?

659
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,800
The first shot takes him out of order.

660
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,844
- The second finishes him off.
- What the fuck...

661
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:23,012
- What are you fucking doing?
- Never in the face.

662
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:26,307
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

663
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:30,103
Because you could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

664
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,731
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

665
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:35,984
- Okay. Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

666
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,820
What the fuck is going on? Hey, mister!

667
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,073
What are you fucking...

668
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:49,247
You see, when you use the silencer a lot
you have to put a piece of cloth here,

669
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,333
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

670
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,794
A damp, black cloth is the best.

671
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,133
What you doing?

672
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,678
We said no women, no kids.

673
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:07,557
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

674
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,158
Now it's clean.

675
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:29,370
Let's get out of here.

676
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,929
I thought we don't have the right to drink.

677
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:49,641
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.

678
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:54,938
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well done,

679
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:59,275
how about a kiss, like in the movies?

680
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,654
No.

681
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,156
Yes.

682
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,411
- What you doing?
- I'm going to kiss you.

683
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:11,955
Mathilda, stop, please.

684
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,832
Come on. Just a kiss.

685
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,501
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

686
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,089
Go sit down.

687
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:30,974
Enjoy.

688
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,358
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

689
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,652
When I say I'm in love with you.

690
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:46,865
Mathilda, please drop it.
Just change the subject, okay?

691
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,741
Okay, okay. Sorry.

692
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:53,204
So how old were you
when you made your first hit?

693
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,832
Nineteen.

694
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,210
Beat you.

695
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:06,569
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

696
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:57,328
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

697
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,293
- Yes?
- Hi.

698
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,922
I'm looking for Mr. Reuben's apartment,

699
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:10,925
but it's all dark out here in the hall,
and I'm lost.

700
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,304
Just a second.

701
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:28,735
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

702
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,945
You think you're going to get me
that easily?

703
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,576
Fuck you. Motherfucker.

704
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,537
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

705
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:43,708
Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.

706
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,878
Asshole! Come on,
show me your fucking face, faggot!

707
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,963
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.

708
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,425
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

709
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:56,429
Ring trick? Come on, asshole. I'm waiting.
Show it to me, motherfucker.

710
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,149
That's the ring trick.

711
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:27,085
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

712
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:41,724
Hey, Leon, what's up? All done already?

713
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:43,601
No, no.

714
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,771
Nicer than people, eh?

715
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,524
I told you that.

716
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,945
- You got a problem?
- No.

717
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,450
Get the chair. Sit down. Sit.

718
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:07,500
I was thinking.

719
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:14,423
If something happens to me someday...

720
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:18,052
Hey, Leon, nothing's gonna happen to you.

721
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,472
You're indestructible. Bullets slide off you.
You play with them.

722
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:25,143
Tony, I thought about my money.

723
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:34,652
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

724
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:36,821
Yeah.

725
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:42,827
Her name is Mathilda.

726
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,330
If anything happens to me,

727
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:50,960
I'd like you

728
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,297
to give her

729
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,259
my money.

730
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,015
You can count on me, Leon.

731
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,601
- Thank you, Tony.
- Yeah.

732
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:12,023
I won't be long.

733
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,027
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

734
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:20,114
This one is too big.

735
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:24,702
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers, is that it?

736
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:30,499
Mathilda, since I met you,
everything's been different.

737
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,962
So I just need some time alone.

738
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:41,135
You need some time to grow up a little.

739
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,387
I finished growing up, Leon.

740
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,473
I just get older.

741
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:48,351
For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough.

742
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,480
I need time to grow up.

743
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:08,788
Shit.

744
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,575
Come on! Come on! Come on! Hustle!

745
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:30,619
- Good shot.
- Come on.

746
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:37,376
You're new, aren't you? Fifth floor, right?

747
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:40,046
- You know, you can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?

748
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,840
Nothing's free. Like a parking meter.

749
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:45,509
When you stop, you pay. It's the law.

750
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,012
- Only on TV.
- What'd you say?

751
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:51,307
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars,

752
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,142
a month.

753
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,188
Got change?

754
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:01,025
Don't worry about it. We'll do 10 for 12.

755
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:04,028
I'll pay now for the rest of the year, okay?

756
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:05,696
Okay, a year.

757
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:09,241
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

758
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:11,535
No.

759
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,538
So go play somewhere else.

760
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:19,960
I need to think.

761
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,729
Stand up. What, you don't like your job?

762
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:31,949
Food.

763
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:40,249
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, Room 4602.

764
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:41,959
Sign here.

765
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:43,669
Come here.

766
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:50,134
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.

767
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,928
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

768
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:15,719
Special delivery? Let me guess.

769
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,057
Chinese?

770
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:25,020
Thai, maybe?

771
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,858
I've got it.

772
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,653
Italian food.

773
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:53,591
- What's your name, angel?
- Mathilda.

774
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:55,843
Mathilda.

775
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,117
Mathilda.

776
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:24,955
I want you to put the sack on the floor.

777
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:32,004
Good.

778
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:39,261
And now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

779
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:43,557
And don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

780
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:47,227
Nobody sent me. I do business for myself.

781
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:51,982
So this is something

782
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,778
personal, is it?

783
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:03,744
What filthy piece of shit

784
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,121
did I do now?

785
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,166
You killed my brother.

786
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:14,922
I'm sorry.

787
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,016
And you want to join him?

788
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:30,229
No.

789
01:33:30,689 --> 01:33:32,815
It's always the same thing.

790
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:42,074
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death

791
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:46,161
that you learn to appreciate life.

792
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:50,999
Do you like life, sweetheart?

793
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:55,045
Yes.

794
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:00,592
That's good.

795
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:08,142
Because I take no pleasure

796
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:11,895
in taking a life

797
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:16,775
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

798
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:31,665
Stan. Stan. Shit, Stan,
I've been looking all over for you, man,

799
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,918
- and I checked upstairs...
- What? I'm busy.

800
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,755
It's Malky, man. He's dead.

801
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:43,343
Malky was making a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

802
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,263
Yo, but they got nothing to do with it, man.

803
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:51,185
They told me this guy came from the outside.
He was a pro.

804
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:55,022
He was fast.
He fucking came out of nowhere.

805
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:58,108
Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.

806
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,737
Easy, man. I'm a cop.

807
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:04,823
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like...

808
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:06,784
No women, no kids.

809
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:18,045
I think it was something personal.

810
01:35:19,964 --> 01:35:23,967
Death is whimsical today.

811
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:55,165
Blood, do you hear me?

812
01:35:55,542 --> 01:35:58,710
Yeah, man, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

813
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:02,673
Would you take her up to my office?

814
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:05,843
All right. Yeah.

815
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:16,019
Jesus fucking Christ.

816
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:30,075
"Leon, my love.

817
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,494
"I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.

818
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:37,040
"Their boss is Norman Stansfield
and he's in the DEA building, Room 4602.

819
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:39,293
"I'm gonna do them myself.

820
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:43,130
"If something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.

821
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:46,341
"It's for a contract. Five grand a head, right?

822
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:50,095
"I know I'll feel better after I do this.

823
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,765
"I love you. Mathilda."

824
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:00,147
Wait for me. I won't be long.

825
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:03,525
Whoa, I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

826
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:10,866
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

827
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:12,743
A nine milli.

828
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:15,662
Bullets.

829
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:18,165
And another nine milli.

830
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,211
What'd you plan to do with all these guns?

831
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:26,256
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

832
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:34,097
Holy shit! What we got here? Lunch.

833
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,644
Careful, Blood, it might be poisoned.

834
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:40,729
No, man. There's no anchovies on this.

835
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:00,040
Is that what you call "I won't be long"?

836
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,834
I've been hanging around here
for at least 10 minutes.

837
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,419
I did my best.

838
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:54,136
Do you like it?

839
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,847
Yes.

840
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:59,015
So say it.

841
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:03,645
I like it.

842
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:20,203
Not thirsty?

843
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,466
You know, a girl's first time
is very important.

844
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:35,469
It determines the rest of her life sexually.

845
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,889
I read that once
in one of my sister's magazines.

846
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:42,559
My girlfriends told me that
they hated their first experience.

847
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:46,563
That's because they didn't love the guys.

848
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:50,400
They just did it to show off.

849
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:53,779
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

850
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:00,660
Will I like it the first time?

851
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:06,625
Mathilda, no.

852
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:10,587
Why not?

853
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:12,964
I just can't.

854
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,760
- You love someone else?
- No.

855
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:19,262
I mean...

856
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:25,936
There was someone a long time ago.

857
01:40:27,438 --> 01:40:29,606
Before I came to the States.

858
01:40:30,107 --> 01:40:32,776
Her father didn't want her to see me.

859
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:37,030
She was from a very respectable family.

860
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:40,200
Mine was,

861
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:42,536
you know,

862
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:46,498
not so respectable.

863
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,252
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

864
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:53,630
She still snuck off to see you, right?

865
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:57,968
- Right.
- See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

866
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,556
He killed her.

867
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:05,559
One shot through the head.

868
01:41:09,188 --> 01:41:12,983
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

869
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:17,362
They said it was an accident.

870
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:20,824
So

871
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:26,246
one night I waited for him.

872
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:31,001
Five hundred feet with a lens.

873
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,964
He also had an accident.

874
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:40,635
The same night I took a boat and came here

875
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,014
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

876
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:46,933
I was 19.

877
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:54,399
Since then I've never left the city,

878
01:41:58,571 --> 01:42:00,947
and I've never had another girlfriend.

879
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,744
You see, Mathilda,

880
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:09,039
I wouldn't be a good lover.

881
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,250
Okay.

882
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:18,048
Would you do me one favor?

883
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:19,549
What?

884
01:42:20,009 --> 01:42:22,344
I'm sick of watching you
sleeping on your chair.

885
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:24,471
We're gonna share the bed.

886
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:27,724
I don't think it's a good idea.

887
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:30,518
It's okay.

888
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:34,397
Put your legs up on the bed.
Yeah. That's nice.

889
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:42,697
Put your head down. It's okay. Relax.

890
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:05,929
Good night, Leon.

891
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,433
Good night.

892
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:37,502
I want a piece of cake first!

893
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,131
Hey, come on.

894
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,094
Manolo, take the kids in the kitchen.

895
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:08,908
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

896
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:14,039
When you've killed for us in the past,
we've always been satisfied.

897
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:19,711
And that's exactly why today
is going to be very, very hard for me.

898
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:22,714
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

899
01:44:26,886 --> 01:44:30,221
My man was killed right here on your turf.

900
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:33,850
And the Chinks tell me that the hit man

901
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:37,437
was kind of the Italian type.

902
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:41,775
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

903
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:43,943
Wait. There's more.

904
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:47,363
You're gonna love this.

905
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:54,245
A few hours later,
a little 12-year-old girl comes into my office,

906
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:58,875
armed to the teeth, with the firm intention
of sending me straight to the morgue.

907
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:01,211
And do you know who came and got her
in the middle of the afternoon

908
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,421
right there in my building?

909
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:07,801
The very same Italian hit man.

910
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:15,100
I'm dying to meet him.

911
01:45:20,106 --> 01:45:24,484
Relax. Everything's fine. Sleep well?

912
01:45:24,777 --> 01:45:28,488
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

913
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:30,406
Yeah, I forgot.

914
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:34,828
You know, I never saw someone
with one eye open snore so much.

915
01:45:35,621 --> 01:45:37,497
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

916
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:43,002
I'm gonna go get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

917
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,004
Don't forget the code when you come back.

918
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:47,757
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again. Right?

919
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:49,008
Right.

920
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:12,365
Ring these up. I'm gonna go get some milk.

921
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:34,888
From here on out, you don't make a sound.

922
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:39,100
You answer my questions by nodding yes
or shaking your head no. You got it?

923
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:40,602
Is he alone?

924
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:43,146
Does he expect you?

925
01:46:43,814 --> 01:46:46,232
Do you have keys to the apartment?

926
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:50,236
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?

927
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:39,661
Alpha team.

928
01:47:39,745 --> 01:47:43,039
- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.

929
01:48:27,543 --> 01:48:30,336
Leon! Leon!

930
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:33,131
What up? What up? Move! Move! Fuck.

931
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:40,179
Shit.

932
01:48:42,308 --> 01:48:44,309
Alpha team. Man down. Man down.

933
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:46,811
I told you.

934
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:48,980
Benny.

935
01:48:51,608 --> 01:48:54,360
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, "Everyone"?

936
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:56,529
Everyone!

937
01:49:50,626 --> 01:49:51,959
Take this.

938
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:00,051
Go take a look.

939
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,110
Don't move.

940
01:50:17,986 --> 01:50:19,737
Do you see anything?

941
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:24,033
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

942
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:29,622
Okay, nobody moves.

943
01:50:29,706 --> 01:50:31,374
Let the girl go.

944
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,292
Now, take it easy, man!

945
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:34,836
Let the girl go.

946
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,088
Okay, the girl's coming out.

947
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:39,006
Let the girl go.

948
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:51,060
Grab the ax off the wall. Over there. Go!

949
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:56,816
You're coming with us.

950
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:11,414
Christ, he shot him!

951
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:13,916
Bastard!

952
01:51:24,803 --> 01:51:26,721
Move, move, move, move!

953
01:51:29,475 --> 01:51:31,809
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

954
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:33,728
Come!

955
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:38,608
We're in a bad way here. Send the Cats.
I repeat. Send the Cats.

956
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:52,872
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see them coming, I swear!

957
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:57,710
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

958
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:02,423
Stay away from the window.

959
01:52:29,868 --> 01:52:30,868
Leon.

960
01:52:32,162 --> 01:52:33,162
Leon.

961
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:49,512
Come here.

962
01:52:52,474 --> 01:52:53,683
Snipers.

963
01:52:56,603 --> 01:52:59,564
Okay, now,
get this fucking asshole out of there.

964
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:19,542
How are we gonna get out of here now?

965
01:53:19,876 --> 01:53:22,378
Leave it to me. We're checking out.

966
01:54:21,521 --> 01:54:24,106
But, Leon, it's not big enough for you.

967
01:54:24,441 --> 01:54:26,942
- It's barely big enough for me.
- We said no discussion.

968
01:54:27,027 --> 01:54:29,278
- No, I'm not letting...
- Listen...

969
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:32,281
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen...

970
01:54:32,491 --> 01:54:35,534
- Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.
- I won't go!

971
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:36,994
We have no chance together.

972
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:38,996
But if I'm alone, I can do it. Trust me.

973
01:54:39,081 --> 01:54:42,708
I'm in good shape, Mathilda.
I know I've got a lot of money with Tony.

974
01:54:42,793 --> 01:54:45,711
A lot. We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

975
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:46,879
Okay? Go.

976
01:54:46,963 --> 01:54:50,758
No. You're just saying that so I won't worry.

977
01:54:55,013 --> 01:54:58,474
- I don't wanna lose you, Leon.
- You're not gonna lose me, Mathilda.

978
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:00,559
You've given me a taste for life.

979
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:03,562
I wanna be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

980
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:06,607
You'll never be alone again, Mathilda.

981
01:55:09,444 --> 01:55:12,071
Please, go now, baby. Go.

982
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:17,118
Calm down. Go now. Go.

983
01:55:18,286 --> 01:55:19,286
Go.

984
01:55:19,663 --> 01:55:23,541
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna clean them all.
Tony's in an hour.

985
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:33,217
- I love you, Mathilda.
- I love you, too, Leon.

986
01:56:08,545 --> 01:56:11,422
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
what the fuck is going on up there?

987
01:56:11,506 --> 01:56:14,341
I just said take the guy out,
not the whole fucking building.

988
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:37,198
Hey, we've got one breathing here!

989
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:40,701
Get a medic on the horn!

990
01:56:44,414 --> 01:56:46,749
Clear the hall! Let him through!

991
01:56:49,419 --> 01:56:53,172
- We've got a wounded man here. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

992
01:56:55,842 --> 01:56:57,384
Let's go! Move!

993
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:00,387
Get that guy off the stairs!
Leave him on the landing.

994
01:57:00,472 --> 01:57:02,848
- Get your team back up there!
- I got him!

995
01:57:03,558 --> 01:57:06,977
We've got two men coming down the stairs.
Let's hurry!

996
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:29,667
You okay?

997
01:57:29,835 --> 01:57:33,963
Hey, I need a medic over here!
Move your fucking asses.

998
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:36,715
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

999
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,510
Can't see shit. Too much smoke in here.
Give us five minutes to clear it out.

1000
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:40,553
Okay. You got it.

1001
01:57:40,637 --> 01:57:44,431
What, what, what? You're 200 men
and you can't find one man and a girl?

1002
01:57:44,516 --> 01:57:45,850
Did you find the girl?

1003
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:58,779
Hi, how are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

1004
01:58:00,907 --> 01:58:04,660
Let me see you. That's deep. Right.
And this one here...

1005
01:58:05,036 --> 01:58:07,913
- You're from the 3rd Precinct?
- Yeah.

1006
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:13,919
All right, let's open up his sleeve a little bit.

1007
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:19,967
All right, fine. Put it down. Put it down.
This one.

1008
01:58:37,027 --> 01:58:39,069
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

1009
01:58:39,154 --> 01:58:42,573
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

1010
01:58:43,241 --> 01:58:45,701
Okay. You're all right. Sit tight.

1011
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:54,585
Okay, come on, everybody out!

1012
01:58:54,794 --> 01:58:58,088
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on. Out!

1013
01:59:22,322 --> 01:59:24,740
Clear the way. Clear the way, men.

1014
01:59:34,376 --> 01:59:36,877
Come on. What are you doing here?
Get out. Get out. Come on.

1015
02:01:28,698 --> 02:01:30,032
Stansfield.

1016
02:01:30,992 --> 02:01:32,576
At your service.

1017
02:01:41,544 --> 02:01:44,671
This is from

1018
02:01:51,262 --> 02:01:52,554
Mathilda.

1019
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:10,572
Shit.

1020
02:02:32,262 --> 02:02:33,303
Get out of here!

1021
02:02:37,267 --> 02:02:40,936
Leon asked me to help you out
if something happened,

1022
02:02:42,313 --> 02:02:44,815
and I think something happened, right?

1023
02:02:44,899 --> 02:02:47,401
He put aside a little cash for you.

1024
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:52,447
So what I'm suggesting is that
seeing as how you're still so young,

1025
02:02:53,324 --> 02:02:56,326
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

1026
02:02:56,452 --> 02:02:57,411
Like a bank, you know,

1027
02:02:57,495 --> 02:03:02,291
except it's better than a bank, 'cause,
you know, banks always get knocked off.

1028
02:03:02,792 --> 02:03:06,044
No one knocks off old Tony.
But it's your money.

1029
02:03:06,671 --> 02:03:11,175
In the meantime,
all you gotta do is come here

1030
02:03:11,259 --> 02:03:15,888
every once in a while and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun, okay?

1031
02:03:18,308 --> 02:03:19,391
Here.

1032
02:03:19,893 --> 02:03:24,021
- Here's a hundred bucks to start with.
- Can't I get a job instead?

1033
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,647
A job?

1034
02:03:28,026 --> 02:03:30,777
- What the hell can you do?
- I can clean.

1035
02:03:32,322 --> 02:03:37,242
I ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid,
so get it out of your goddamn head!

1036
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:40,871
It's over! The game's over! Leon's dead!

1037
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:43,665
You hear me?

1038
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:56,720
Come on. You think I ain't hurting, too?

1039
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:03,602
But he's dead.

1040
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:09,399
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

1041
02:04:09,943 --> 02:04:12,903
Now take this money
and get the hell out of here.

1042
02:04:12,987 --> 02:04:15,072
And don't let me see your face
till next month,

1043
02:04:15,156 --> 02:04:19,201
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1044
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:12,254
My parents

1045
02:05:14,757 --> 02:05:18,510
died in a car accident four weeks ago.

1046
02:05:21,347 --> 02:05:22,931
It was terrible.

1047
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:28,520
You know, we didn't have the time
to get to know one another

1048
02:05:28,604 --> 02:05:30,647
when you first came here,

1049
02:05:30,732 --> 02:05:34,276
but I want you to know that I'm not
the kind of woman who'd let down a child,

1050
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:37,362
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

1051
02:05:37,447 --> 02:05:42,200
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

1052
02:05:44,579 --> 02:05:46,330
But on one condition.

1053
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:49,624
You have to stop lying to me, Mathilda.

1054
02:05:50,668 --> 02:05:54,046
I want you to take a chance and trust me.

1055
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:57,799
Now, tell me what happened to you.

1056
02:05:59,052 --> 02:06:00,052
Okay.

1057
02:06:01,888 --> 02:06:06,308
My family got shot down by DEA officers
because of a drug problem.

1058
02:06:08,519 --> 02:06:10,896
I lived with the greatest guy on Earth.

1059
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:15,650
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

1060
02:06:15,985 --> 02:06:19,154
And if you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

1061
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:42,761
- You know her?
- No. I've never seen her.

1062
02:07:09,497 --> 02:07:11,873
I think we'll be okay here, Leon.
