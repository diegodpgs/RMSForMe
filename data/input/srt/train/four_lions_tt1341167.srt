1
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,479
Yeah?

2
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,839
No, sit properly
like you're gonna mean it,

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,359
like you mean it.

4
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,719
No, Waj, don't muck about.

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,279
Cos the battery's gonna go. Sit...

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,999
Who's mucking about, Barry?
I'm not mucking about.

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,279
Well, you can't sit like that.

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,559
What's wrong
with how he's sitting, Barry?

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,159
Come and have a look. It's wrong.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,519
There's nothing wrong with it.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,439
- Not you!
- Show me.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,119
No!
Right, what are you looking at?

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,519
There's nothing there.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,719
No, there's nothing there.
Go and sit down.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,639
- You can't see yourself, you mug!
- I thought you were recording it.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,239
Right, sit, sit.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,239
- Faisal, go away.
- I'm ready, I'm ready.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,839
- All right.
- Waj, just relax your face.

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,719
Focus on what you're going to say.
Get on with it.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,799
- Go, before the battery goes.
- One, two...

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,319
Three... action!

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,759
Ey up,
you unbelieving kuffar bastards.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,279
- I'm gonna turn you baked beans...
- No, no, no.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,119
- What?
- What's with the gun?

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,639
- Proper replica, man.
- What for? Action Man?

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,439
Replica AK-47.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,839
- It's too small, man.
- Not too small, brother.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,199
- My hands.
- Waj...

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,719
Big hands.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,319
He can't do it with that gun.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,479
Shut up, Barry.
Try it without, our kid, and let's go.

32
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,679
It's too small, believe me.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,559
I'll hold it near the camera.
That'll bigger it.

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,839
- That'll what?
- That'll bigger it.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,719
- Yeah.
- Go now.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,719
Ey up, you unbelieving kuffar bastards.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,919
No, no, no!
This is absolutely stupid.

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,399
These are the outtakes.
You know, the bloopers.

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,079
- He looks good.
- Today is a wake-up call.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,879
Today is an opportunity
for you to look in the mirror

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,359
at western imperialist culture.

42
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,559
Superficial materialism

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,079
ends at the capitalist church
of McDonald's.

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,679
Flipping idiots.

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,079
It's as though you just had a Big Mac,
completely oblivious to the amount...

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,999
Complete flipping idiots.

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,399
You could've gone Chicken Cottage,
proper halal,

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,479
bargain bucket £6.99.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,359
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Chicken Cottage.

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,039
- There's one where he doesn't say that.
- Your bit's good, Dad.

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,959
Take the box off.

52
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,159
I can't show my face
cos it's an image.

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,439
And images aren't allowed.

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,719
You know what? They're all bloopers.

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,479
Take the box off.

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,279
What am I going to do
if he does that at the camp?

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,199
Is Uncle Faisal ready to go to Pakistan?

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,799
You can't do your jihadi video
with a box on your head.

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,879
No way.

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,519
Ran 23K on the weekend.

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,319
6K Saturday morning.

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,959
Had a light lunch:
Snack-a-Jacks and a medium apple.

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
5K in the afternoon,
cos obviously it was after lunch, so...

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,359
Same again Sunday.

65
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,479
Although in the afternoon
I only did 4K cos I'd had a roast.

66
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,239
Would've gone further, you know,
but I started to run a bit lopsided.

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,559
I'm not slagging my right leg off,
but my left leg is definitely stronger.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,839
I think lefty just wants it more, you know.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,879
Right leg's bone idle.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,479
He'll just wait there,
let lefty pick up the slack.

71
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,799
Before you know it,
you're running in curves.

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,479
I'm going to have
to put my foot down, you know.

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,439
Really show him who's boss. Yeah.
Know what I mean?

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,839
You do know you can talk to your legs,
don't you?

75
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,919
- I need tomorrow off.
- What?

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,759
I need tomorrow off,
and the two weeks after that.

77
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,839
Jesus, I thought you were serious
about this job, Omar.

78
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,959
I've got to go to a wedding in Pakistan.

79
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,999
You've got to ask yourself
where you'll be in five years' time.

80
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,759
- It's an emergency.
- What, an emergency wedding?

81
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,919
Like a shotgun wedding?

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,159
Like a shotgun wedding, yeah.

83
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,479
Right.

84
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,799
Well, I'll have a look at the rota.

85
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,319
The Feds can track your phone
even if the battery's out.

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,239
- Really?
- Really. They can see you underground, right?

87
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,279
Can they see you if you're not there?

88
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,079
Where's there?

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,599
I don't know.

90
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,159
They can see you everywhere, Waj.

91
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,839
Are they looking at us
through cameras?

92
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,399
- Space cameras, yes.
- But...

93
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,279
My dad says I'm not supposed
to be on camera. It's haram.

94
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,559
With the greatest of respect, Faisal,
your dad eats newspaper.

95
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,279
- Not any more. He eats moths.
- Exactly, bro.

96
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,719
Look, the way to stop the Feds
tracking you is very simple.

97
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,599
You eat your SIM card.
Get your SIM cards out.

98
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,039
You remove the SIM card and...
Yes?

99
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,559
- Can I cook mine?
- No. You must eat it raw, like this.

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,119
Good boys.

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,399
Salaam, lads.

102
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,159
Walaykum asalaam.

103
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,519
- Right.
- We're eating our SIM cards.

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,319
Anti-surveillance.

105
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,079
You know they still work
inside you, Barry.

106
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,039
- Eh?
- They can still track them inside you.

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,959
That's not going to be
very helpful in Pakistan.

108
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,359
- What?
- In Pakistan.

109
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,919
Answered the call, bro.

110
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,319
- What call?
- Training camp.

111
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,439
We're upgrading.

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,759
We're going.

113
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,159
Why did you get the call?
Why didn't I get the call?

114
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,399
You don't have an uncle in Pakistan
last time I checked.

115
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,919
You got an uncle in Folkstone.
Are there any training camps in Folkstone?

116
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,519
Why do we need a training camp, anyway?
We're primed.

117
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,279
We don't need some tramp up a mountain,
telling us to set a fuse.

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,399
We don't need some Paki Steptoe
telling us when to go.

119
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,919
You're right, Barry.
We can go whenever we want.

120
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,519
Exactly. Whenever we want, bro.

121
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,039
Yeah, if you want to be some kind of
sad loner trenchcoat mafia twazzock.

122
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,159
What do you mean?

123
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,879
What I mean is, you can either be
a stupid nutter Muslim

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,879
who blows a bag full of nails
into his own guts at a toilet at TGI's,

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,319
or you can be a proper soldier
in the Mujahideen.

126
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,079
- I'm already in the Mujahideen.
- No, you're not, bro.

127
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,079
No, not until you join the army

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,639
and hold the sword

129
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,319
and touch the sky -
proper chain of command,

130
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,519
right to the very top.

131
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,999
- All right, I'm coming.
- Oh, you want Paki Steptoe now?

132
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,159
Listen, I am the most Al Qaeda one here.

133
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,039
Think of the group.
Think of what we're trying to do.

134
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,359
It's best you stay here, bro.

135
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,439
You're a liability
and you're a loose cannon.

136
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,199
Bollocks, I'm a liability.

137
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,639
I am the invisible Jihadi.

138
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,079
They seek him here,
they seek him there.

139
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,759
But he's not there,
he's blowing up your slag sister.

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,359
- Invisible?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,359
Like the time you got on the local news
for baking a Twin Towers cake

142
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,399
and leaving it at the synagogue on 9/11?

143
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,719
That is part of the plan.

144
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,079
Hide in plain sight, you mug.

145
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,039
And I am coming!

146
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,639
You realise, if I don't come
with you to Pakistan, bro,

147
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,959
Islam is finished.

148
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,599
Listen, bro, we need you over here
to keep a lid on things.

149
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,319
So what if I'm not here?

150
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,719
Cos I've bought a ticket at the airport
to come with you anyways.

151
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,999
You want to come, Fess?

152
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,639
Yeah, it's just... my dad's
seeing creatures that's not there.

153
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,639
- So he'll keep it ticking over here, bro.
- Barry, listen.

154
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,679
- If you answer this question, you can come.
- All right.

155
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,599
Don't fuck with me, man!

156
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,519
Don't fuck with Azzam al Britani!

157
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,399
Barry, what are you doing?

158
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,239
Barry, this is crazy.

159
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,479
- Barry, what are you doing?
- Right, if I'm not going, no one is.

160
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,639
Spit it out.

161
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,719
It's gone down his neck.

162
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,719
Right, frog him.

163
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,119
- Frog him in the back.
- Omar, we agreed, no frogging.

164
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,999
That was before you swallowed the key.
Every time I've had to frog you.

165
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,119
- Listen, we...
- Come on. Come on.

166
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,119
We said no frogging!

167
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,959
What if you get caught?
I'm not going down.

168
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,199
Just cos you can't take
a drill in the kneecap.

169
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,159
They'll crack you like babies' fingers.

170
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,719
They'll pump you full ofViagra,
make you fuck a dog.

171
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,639
Good prattle, Barry.

172
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,959
You'll end up on YouTube,
blowing Lassie in a ditch.

173
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,599
Are they gonna make me fuck
a dog out there, brother Omar?

174
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,759
My uncle's connected out there.

175
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,399
Only time we're going to see cops
is for weapons upgrade.

176
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,119
All right, Omar,
I'm letting you go to Pakistan.

177
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,319
My unit stays here.

178
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,759
- But my unit's the main unit.
- Barry, shut up, mate.

179
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,799
Because I tell you, your little brain cell
might go off now and again,

180
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,319
but if your hands even go to move

181
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,239
and you try setting up
the Islamic state of Tinsley again,

182
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,159
going to university lectures,
opening your big mouth,

183
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,439
buying some more silver nitrate from Amazon,

184
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,559
I'm gonna rip your plugs out.

185
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,959
Not if you're not here, you won't.

186
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,319
Aargh!

187
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,759
No, Uncle.

188
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,439
It's my prayer bear.
He does my prayers.

189
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,439
In the name of Allah...

190
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,959
Which way are we going?

191
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,119
All right. OK.

192
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,879
What the fuck's he done
to his rabbits, bro?

193
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,919
They're not rabbits, bro.
They're chickens.

194
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,079
They're fucking rabbits.

195
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,759
Bro, if they're rabbits,
where are their ears?

196
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,399
That's what I'm saying.

197
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,119
What?

198
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,159
What's he saying?

199
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,039
I'm asking, would he kill you?

200
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,519
Pack up.

201
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,839
If you make me trouble...

202
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,359
Alaykum salaam.

203
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,479
- Would you kill me, then?
- No, course not.

204
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,239
Come on.

205
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,559
I'd kill you, bro.

206
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,599
Would you?

207
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,279
- Yeah.
- Right, good.

208
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,359
Cos I would kill you, bro.

209
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,159
Bro, seriously, I'd kill you.

210
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,679
Course I would.

211
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,599
Aye, I would. I'd kill you like that.

212
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,439
- Flipping heck, man. Would you?
- Yeah, course.

213
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,919
I sort of thought
I were joking a bit there, bro.

214
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,199
We're soldiers, bro.
Whatever's asked, you do it.

215
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,079
You do the right thing.

216
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,199
Right?

217
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,279
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.

218
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,439
It's life, isn't it? It's just life.
What is that? It's nothing.

219
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,959
It's like being stuck
in the queue at Alton Towers.

220
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,479
Do you want to be in the queues
or do you want to be on the rides?

221
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,959
You want to be on the rides, don't you?
You want to be on Nemesis, Oblivion.

222
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,599
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

223
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,439
- Yeah. You with me?
- Yeah.

224
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,239
- Rubber Dinghy Rapids.
- Yeah, Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

225
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,679
Right?

226
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,759
- OK, I would kill you, brother Omar.
- Would you?

227
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,559
- Yeah, I would.
- What would you do?

228
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,999
- I'd smash your head off with a thing.
- Yeah. Know what I'd do?

229
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,439
I'd grab one of these hooks, Waj.
I'd dig it in your belly, rip your guts out.

230
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,679
Spill it all out on the floor,
like Mortal Combat.

231
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,839
I'd fucking... I'd take this, right?

232
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,039
- Yeah?
- And I'd fucking run you over with a tractor.

233
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,239
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Soldiers.

234
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,799
Soldiers, brother. Mujahid.

235
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,039
Mujahid.

236
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,359
Good lad.

237
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,839
Come on. You want some?

238
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,679
Yeah, you do want some, rabbit.

239
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,799
You fucked-up rabbit with no ears.

240
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,119
- I'll fucking... I'll have you.
- They're chickens, man.

241
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,719
- I'd roast you.
- Waj, they're chickens.

242
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,279
I'm coming. Coming.

243
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,079
I'm coming.

244
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,599
Come on, Waj.

245
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,999
Fuck off, bro. East is that way.

246
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,199
That way is East, bro.

247
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,439
That way is East.

248
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,359
- We've flown over Mecca now.
- Paki's gone mental, bro.

249
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,839
Mecca is in the East, yeah.

250
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,679
Where the sun... where it rises,
you behn choad paki prong!

251
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,799
Turn around. I'll explain to you later.

252
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,879
Fuck! Waj, come on. Come on!

253
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,999
Go, go, go. Come on.

254
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,399
- Come on, Waj.
- OK, OK.

255
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,399
Hey, brother Emir, I'll take it out.

256
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,119
Too high, too high.

257
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,399
Yeah, that's what I was thinking actually.
What is that, 2,000 feet?

258
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,199
- What?
- Nothing.

259
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,679
I've never stood up in public and
professed any in-depth knowledge of Islam,

260
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,039
but what I do know is that most British
Muslims don't want to be out abroad,

261
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,159
fighting British foreign policy.

262
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,159
What they want to do is get on
peacefully with their daily lives.

263
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,799
- And we support that.
- Yeah, yeah.

264
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,199
A good Muslim
always keeps his mouth shut.

265
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,639
Yeah? Yeah? Are you all surprised
kids are going off to training camps?

266
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,599
- That is not what I am saying.
- Why are kids going to training camps?

267
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,319
First off, I object
to the term "training camps".

268
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
- You just used it.
- No, I did not.

269
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,719
It's a western fantasy.

270
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,399
You people think of Muslims
running around the mountains

271
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,559
with guns and bombs.

272
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,759
That'd suit you
down to the ground, wouldn't it?

273
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,239
- But they do exist, don't they?
- I'm not saying they don't exist.

274
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,759
What I'm saying, if you'll listen,

275
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,959
is that if they didn't exist,
you people would have to invent them.

276
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,279
- That's absolute rubbish.
- Yeah, man.

277
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,079
- This whole debate is twisted, man.
- We'll take questions later, please.

278
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,079
You think we're all bombers, don't you?

279
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,959
- That is absolutely...
- No, no, no.

280
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,679
When you look at someone like me,
you think "bomber", right?

281
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,919
- Yeah, you do.
- That is not the case.

282
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,679
Why shouldn't I be a bomber
if you treat me like one?

283
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,199
- Mashallah, brother.
- Yeah, Mashallah.

284
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,719
Yeah.

285
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,879
I'm the Mujahideen
and I'm making a scene

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,039
Now you's gonna feel
what the boom-boom means

287
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,719
It's like Tupac said,
"When I die, I'm not dead"

288
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,839
We are the martyrs,
you're just smashed tomatoes

289
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,399
Allahu Akbar!

290
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,639
Mashallah, brother.

291
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,599
Oh, what, man? Come on.

292
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,599
What? Just cos I'm Muslim,
you thought it was real?

293
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,439
Oh, here they come!

294
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,559
Here come your stooges, Mr Storge.

295
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,079
Police state! Police state!

296
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,119
Police state! Police state!

297
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,759
Remember my name, brothers and sisters.
I'm going to Cuba!

298
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,039
He's being rendered!
He's being rendered!

299
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,999
Hey, bro, bro. Down here.

300
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,759
Need a lift?

301
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,679
Yeah, man. Wait. Yeah.

302
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,679
Oh, man!

303
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,599
Yo!

304
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,399
You're a lege. You're a lege, bro!

305
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,639
Not so bad yourself, brother.
What's your name?

306
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,359
Hassan Malik. "The Mal".

307
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,119
- The Mal?
- Yeah.

308
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,799
Nice little stunt back there.

309
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,639
And you know what?

310
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,639
You're a total piece of shit, mate.

311
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,279
You're worse than the specially trained rapists
they use in Guantánamo.

312
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,879
- You what?
- Yeah, you're not ignorant like them!

313
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,039
You know you should be doing something.

314
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,159
- I am doing something.
- What, that?

315
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,839
I'm the Mujahideen and...
thingy, thingy, rap, rap

316
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,959
Eh?

317
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,439
It was jihad of the mind,
the gesture that messed yer.

318
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,959
Wasthe prophet, Sal Allaahu
Alayhi wa Sallam, about gestures?

319
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,999
Hm? Did he smash the pagan statues

320
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,879
or did he just stand there, making a gesture?

321
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,759
Is this a gesture?

322
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,239
- That was for real, brother.
- Yeah...

323
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,039
Is you as for real as that?

324
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,799
- Yeah.
- How often do you go to mosque?

325
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,399
When I can. Most weeks. Friday prayers.

326
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,959
Once a year is too often.
The mosques have lost it, brother.

327
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,239
They're full of losers and spies.

328
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,199
These are real bad times, bro.

329
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,679
Islam is cracking up.

330
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,799
We got women talking back.

331
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,199
We got people playing stringed instruments.

332
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,399
It's the end of days.

333
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,359
Do you want to be for real?

334
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,959
Well, yeah, of course.

335
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,999
Are you sure?

336
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,319
100 percent.

337
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,159
Yeah, come here.

338
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,439
Fuck you, Omar!

339
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,999
Big enough for you now, Barry?

340
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,319
Am I blowing a dog in a ditch
or am I Paki Rambo?

341
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,999
I'm getting my pictures, Mujahid-style.

342
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,119
- James Fuck Bond?
- No, no.

343
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,319
What the fuck are you doing, Waj?

344
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,879
Stay here and clean the guns.

345
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,879
No, no, listen. We need an Al Qaeda emir.

346
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,119
It was my fault, bro, OK?
Let Omar go.

347
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,639
You fucking Mr Beans.

348
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,639
- But we haven't got an emir yet.
- It's good.

349
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,879
- Just getting my pictures, bro.
- Waj, go away right now.

350
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,959
Come on.

351
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,639
- Where is it?
- Down here.

352
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,559
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

353
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,879
Liquid peroxide.

354
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,799
Three years of stockpiling.

355
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,879
- Where did you get it all?
- A wholesale shop down the road.

356
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,599
- All from the same shop?
- Yeah.

357
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,159
- You mug, you'll get us nicked!
- No.

358
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,079
I use different voices every time I go in.

359
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,399
Different what? Different voices.
Show me.

360
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,519
- What?
- Show me the voices. Come on.

361
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,279
- One of them's... It's my voice.
- Right.

362
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,679
Can I have 12 bottles of bleach, please?

363
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,919
I know what that sounds like.
Give me another one.

364
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,919
IRA voice.

365
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,839
IRA voice?

366
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,079
They're terrorists, Faisal.

367
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,599
Why do you want to do a terrorist voice?
You'll get us nicked!

368
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,519
- I'll be disguised then, won't I?
- Yeah, but as a terrorist.

369
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,799
Let's hear the voice.

370
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,599
Can I have...
12 bottles of bleach, please?

371
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,399
And then I've got one like this as well.

372
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,799
Can I have 12 bottles of bleach, please?

373
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,039
What's that?

374
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,919
It's a woman's voice
because I got loads of liquid peroxide.

375
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,919
Probably thought that she'd go and...

376
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,279
And what?

377
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,399
...dye her hair or something.
- And her beard?

378
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,999
- You got a beard.
- I covered it.

379
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,439
You covered your beard. How?

380
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,719
Right, so you went into a shop,
with your hands on your face like that

381
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,519
and asked for 12 bottles of bleach?

382
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,959
So, why has she got her hands
on her face, Fess?

383
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,519
Cos she's got a beard.

384
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,999
I'm sorry, brother Omar.

385
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,159
Maybe it were God's will.

386
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,719
Maybe it were God's will
I would do my video so...

387
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,479
- So maybe it's not my fault.
- No, it is your fault.

388
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,519
It were God's will that you were acting
like a complete prat, apparently.

389
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,519
It was defo your fault.

390
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,399
So, if that were God's will,
then am I God's fault?

391
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,879
Maybe I'm God's mistake.

392
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,959
- Does that mean I'm going to hell, brother?
- Sh, sh, sh.

393
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,599
- Do mistakes go to hell?
- Shh, Waj.

394
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,719
What?

395
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,679
- That's a drone.
- Hide!

396
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,999
- It's flying low. It's going to attack.
- Let's go!

397
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,999
Where are we gonna go, Waj?
We've got to take it out.

398
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,079
Take it out with what?
We ain't got no bullets.

399
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,279
- This is my mistake, bro.
- No, no, no. Waj, listen.

400
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,439
Think about it. This is God's plan.
He's put us here to defend the camp.

401
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,919
This is our jihad.

402
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,119
- Think about it.
- This is my mistake, brother.

403
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,439
That's the devil that's in your brain
giving it the wasa-wasa.

404
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,719
Don't listen to him.
God's in your heart, bro.

405
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,159
Right? What does your heart say?
Trust me. Come on.

406
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,999
It says maybe we should...

407
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,639
Huh?

408
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,359
Maybe we should flipping pop it, brother,
get back on jihad.

409
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,359
Good, Waj.

410
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,159
Right, OK.

411
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,879
What are we going to use?

412
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,599
- Fucking yes, bro.
- Shh, shh. Right, come on.

413
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,119
- Proper Mujahid, yeah?
- Yeah.

414
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,039
- Rubber Dinghy Rapids, brother?
- Mind out the way now.

415
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,399
- All right, OK.
- Come on.

416
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,999
- Flipping pop it, brother.
- OK.

417
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,719
Brother Omar!

418
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,159
The Arabs!

419
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,519
The emir!

420
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,159
Flipping shit.

421
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,839
Is this God's will, bro?

422
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,239
Tell me it is, bro. Tell me it's God's will.

423
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,399
Fucking hell, bro.

424
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,959
We've got to go, Waj.
We've got to get out of here.

425
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,679
I can't hear nothing!

426
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,559
I can't hear nothing!

427
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,319
Morning, officer.

428
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,199
You've been rumbled.

429
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,839
My plan is, right, to put a bomb on a crow

430
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,639
and fly it into one of them towers
full ofJews and slags.

431
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,519
I keep crows in here. Have a look.

432
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,959
We're way beyond crows now, Faisal.

433
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,959
We are really going to blow the lid off.

434
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,119
Yeah, I'm all about blowing the lid off, man.

435
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,159
- Blow my lid off.
- Bomb the mosque!

436
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,559
What?

437
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,359
- The Masjid?
- Yeah, the masjid, the mosque.

438
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,799
But we go in dressed like kuffars.

439
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,879
They think it's the unbelievers attacking
so all the Muslims rise up and fight back.

440
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,759
Stoke things up proper big time,
fast-track the final days - total war!

441
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,959
- That is sick, man.
- What does Omar say?

442
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,719
Who is this Omar?

443
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,039
Don't sweat that.
He's one of my boys.

444
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,119
I've sent him off to training camp
to bring him up to scratch.

445
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,399
But my dad goes to the masjid.
What if he's in masjid?

446
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,519
Has your dad ever bought
a Jaffa orange?

447
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,399
Once or twice.

448
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,159
Right, he's buying nukes for Israel, bro.
He's a Jew.

449
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,679
- Barry!
- Where?

450
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,119
- Where is he?
- What are we going to say, again?

451
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,959
Waj, we're going to say we're being
sent for special training in Somalia.

452
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,759
- Somalia?
- Yeah, OK.

453
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,159
- You all right, Barry?
- Yeah. What happened?

454
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,999
Nothing happened.
We're being sent to...

455
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,119
Bollocks!
You fucked up, you fucking losers!

456
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,799
I told you you should have taken me.

457
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,319
- We're going to Somibia, Barry.
- Somalia.

458
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,799
- Special training.
- "Special training."

459
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,799
- Bollocks! Something happened.
- Nothing happened, Barry.

460
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,599
Look at the state of you.
No luggage, back early.

461
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,959
Yeah, something happened.

462
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,079
- Yeah, something did happen.
- Yeah, you fucked up.

463
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,359
No, we got an emir
and he told us that we're on.

464
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,479
What?

465
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,039
We've got an emir
and he says that we're on.

466
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,719
- Are you on as well, bro?
- Yeah, for real.

467
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,239
- Good.
- Alhamdulillah.

468
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,879
What about the Arabs, bro?
What about the Arabs?

469
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,279
They weren't Arabs,
they were bad tribesmen.

470
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,919
- What?
- Bad tribesmen.

471
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,879
- So it were good, what we did?
- Yeah.

472
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,359
What the fuck is Special Branch doing here?

473
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,079
Oh, no, no, no.
That's Hassan. He's in.

474
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,679
- Since when, Barry?
- He's one of us.

475
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,479
- Is he fuck?
- How was it, boys? Was it amazing?

476
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,199
What, my dad's funeral?
How could that be amazing?

477
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,799
You're joking!

478
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,879
He was pecked to death by chickens.
Why would I joke about that?

479
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,919
Ignore him, bro. This is Omar,
this is Waj and this is Hassan Malik.

480
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,559
Yeah, man, I'm the Mal.

481
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,079
Frog him.

482
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,799
No, don't sweat it, bro.
He's been tested.

483
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,239
- Really?
- Yeah, he tested me, man.

484
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,999
How did he do that, then?

485
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,319
- He made me do that bean thing, man.
- What bean thing?

486
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,559
You know, when you put a bean
up the end of your knob, man.

487
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,519
We're on the parking. Let's go.

488
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,439
- Barry?
- We're on the parking.

489
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,999
- What's he saying about a bean, Barry?
- You mean, I didn't have to?

490
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,159
Bro, he's landed you right in it.

491
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,839
I've got no need for a beanfucker
or a TV Paki or a coconut spook.

492
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,959
Now, frog him!

493
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,879
Omar, he's loaded. His dad's loaded.

494
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,679
- What, from MI5 payroll?
- No, he's got a clothes factory.

495
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,159
- Great. Merry Christmas. Frog him.
- I can get you a van.

496
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,439
- I can nick a van.
- So you'd steal from your own dad?

497
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,879
Well, yeah, yeah.

498
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,359
Right, well, you're still walking.

499
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,719
Listen, behn choad, next time I see you,
you'd better have a fucking van,

500
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,719
or I'm gonna floss your balls
with razor wire.

501
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,919
You played that wrong, mate.

502
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,199
- You're on one, Omar.
- Drive!

503
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,479
- Did you fix this, Barry?
- Yeah, I fixed it.

504
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,719
- Did you do it yourself or something?
- Yes, I did it myself.

505
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,079
So is he in or what, Omar?

506
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,639
What choice have I got, Barry?
He's either in or I've got to kill him.

507
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,399
Good. I knew you'd like him.

508
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,159
Simba and Pumbaa were out on their own.

509
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,119
And Scar was looking for them and
if he found them, he'd kill them, but...

510
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,319
- Dad?
- Yeah?

511
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,279
Did you blow up any kuffars?

512
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,879
What?

513
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,359
At the wedding?

514
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,239
Do you want to hear
what happened to Simba or not?

515
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,799
- Yeah!
- Right, so...

516
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,439
Simba and Pumbaa
were out on their own,

517
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,959
when all of a sudden they saw this...

518
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,639
...this big evil bird, this big bird,
that Scar had sent out to look for them.

519
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,479
This big, evil vulture, coming right at them.

520
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,679
"There it is," said Simba.
He spotted it,

521
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,199
this big evil vulture,
coming straight for them,

522
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,759
coming right at them.

523
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,759
Then what, Dad?

524
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,759
Well, Simba had to bring it down,
otherwise it'd kill them.

525
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,679
So, what he did was,
he grabbed a stone

526
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,639
and he chucked it at the bird,
only he chucked it so hard,

527
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,439
it was such a strong powerful throw,
that his arm went all the way round.

528
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,799
Behind. He threw it so hard,
it went a mile behind him.

529
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,519
And it hit Mufasa.

530
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,319
Wise, strong Mufasa, Simba's dad.

531
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,999
It hit him accidentally on the head
and killed him.

532
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,479
But didn't Scar kill Mufasa?

533
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,439
Yeah, in the film.
This is real life, I'm talking about.

534
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,239
So Simba had a choice.

535
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,399
He could either tell his friends
what had happened and create confusion,

536
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,559
or keep it a secret and lead all his friends
in a big fight against Scar.

537
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,479
What do you think he did?

538
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,199
He had to tell the truth.

539
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,959
But he's got to fight Scar, hasn't he?

540
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,799
Telling the truth means giving up.

541
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,159
Would Simba give up?

542
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,279
- Simba would never give up.
- Exactly.

543
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,559
Exactly. So...

544
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,399
Simba kept it all a secret.

545
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,439
And he led Pumbaa and Timon
and all his friends,

546
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,319
he led them all in a fight against Scar.

547
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,039
And he vanquished Scar,

548
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,279
and Simba became the new Lion King.

549
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,239
- Yes.
- Yeah.

550
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,159
Bedtime for you,

551
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,679
soldier.

552
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,479
All right, lads, this is it.

553
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,639
This is it, boys.

554
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,359
I've spoken to the emir.
I have, and...

555
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,039
How did you do that?

556
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,119
Email drop box and the children's
instant messaging site, Party Puffin.

557
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,599
I've been on that.

558
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,439
- Good, Waj.
- Proper good.

559
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,959
Do we have to be puffins as well?

560
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,479
Yeah, I'll give you all usernames
and passwords after this meeting.

561
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,879
I'm not sure I want to be a puffin.

562
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,519
You don't have to be
if you don't want to, Barry.

563
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,759
- Bagsy a blue one, yeah?
- Good, Waj.

564
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,399
Now, I've spoken to him.

565
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,039
My puffin has communicated with his puffin.

566
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,559
And he's told us to make some bombs.

567
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,359
So we're going to take Faisal's gear
to the secret flat.

568
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,599
We can hide it under the costumes
in Hassan's van.

569
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,439
We'll put the bleach on the boil.

570
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,239
We have instructions to bring havoc
to this bullshit, consumerist,

571
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,279
godless, Paki-bashing,

572
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,039
Gordon Ramsay "Taste the Difference"
speciality cheddar,

573
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,199
torture-endorsing,
massacre-sponsoring,

574
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,199
"Look-at-me-dancing-pissed
with-my-nob-out", Sky1 Uncovered,

575
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,919
"Who-gives-a-fuck
about-dead-Afghanis?" Disneyland.

576
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,879
- Mashallah!
- Mashallah, brother Omar.

577
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,879
- Mashallah.
- Fuck mini Babybels.

578
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,999
Puffin says, "Find a target."

579
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,799
Well, we got a target, bro.
We're all agreed.

580
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,679
What is it?

581
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,439
- It's the mosque.
- What?

582
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,999
Bomb the mosque,

583
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,919
radicalise the moderates,
bring it all on.

584
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,599
OK, right. No, I like that.
I do like that, that's brilliant.

585
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,479
Let's take out a bunch of Muslims
because they're the real enemy.

586
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,359
Once we've done that,
why don't we truck-bomb a kebab shop

587
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,199
and fly a jumbo jet
into Waj's mum's head?

588
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,039
Why don't we get a pig
and staple-gun it to our foreheads?

589
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,199
But if we bomb the mosque,
it will make all the Muslims rise up.

590
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,559
My cousin, Faz, died,

591
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,519
defending a mosque in Bosnia.

592
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,319
Did he flipping rise up, bro?

593
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,999
Let's bomb Boots.

594
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,359
They sell condoms
that make you want to bang white girls.

595
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,719
- I second that. Boots.
- Right.

596
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,999
- They nabbed me nicking Lynx display.
- Think bigger than a chemist's.

597
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,319
I'm not blowing my guts out over
a bunch of tampons and cotton buds.

598
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,159
What we're going to do
has got to last in history,

599
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,679
echo through the ages.

600
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,559
- Like bomb a mosque.
- Barry, we're not bombing a mosque.

601
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,559
You don't get it, do you, Omar?

602
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,359
We radicalise the moderates!

603
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,719
The ummah rises up, it all kicks off!

604
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,159
I do get it. I'll tell you what it's like.
It's like you're in a fight with someone,

605
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,439
and they're punching you
in the face, right?

606
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,039
And so what you go and do is,
you punch yourself in the face.

607
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,199
So what if he's not?

608
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,599
I'm having a fight
with this fictionary man,

609
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,799
and he's not punching me hard enough
to make me go mental and win.

610
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,559
Let's do an experiment, Barry.
We'll have a fight right now.

611
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,679
When you start losing
and you're not doing very well,

612
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,119
you punch yourself in the face,
go mental and start winning.

613
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,519
- Show them all how it works.
- I'm not gonna punch myself.

614
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,919
Why not? You're the Muslims.
You're getting attacked.

615
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,159
Go fucking mental, Barry.
Show 'em how it works.

616
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,519
- Come on.
- I'm not a mosque!

617
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,959
This is not how it works!

618
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,879
Punch yourself, Baz.

619
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,479
Bomb the mosque, Barry!
Bomb it!

620
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,679
Bomb the mosque!

621
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,719
Bomb the mosque, Barry!

622
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,159
He's bombed the mosque!
He's just bombed the mosque!

623
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,439
Barry, where are the moderates?
The moderates should be coming now.

624
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,919
Right, if I was a mosque,
which I am not,

625
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,839
then there would be all moderates
behind my nose,

626
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,839
bursting to come out and rise up.

627
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,319
Would there?
Ooh, they are, bro, eh?

628
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,279
Barry, the Sufi Muslim Council's
coming out your nose.

629
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,319
Oh, you've just wiped them out.
You've just wiped them out.

630
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,799
Do you think we should still
bomb the mosque, Barry?

631
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,519
- Come back.
- Barry, I got you a J-cloth for the...

632
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,639
- Oooh!
- Barry!

633
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,599
For fuck's sake, Barry!

634
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,119
Oi! Oi!

635
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,359
Turn that off.
There's common areas out there.

636
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,999
We got to play it, Barry.
This is our cover, man. We're a band.

637
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,559
- We're a what?
- We're a band.

638
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,359
Bollocks! Turn it off.

639
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,639
Bro, turn it off.

640
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,559
What's with the chicken?

641
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,279
It's beard protection from the bleach.

642
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,999
Yeah, he's the drummer, man.

643
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,079
- Chicken drummer.
- Yeah, Barry.

644
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,159
You broke the chicken's beak, didn't you?
Remember?

645
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,039
Yeah, Barry, you broke his beak.

646
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,919
Yeah, well, I'm sorry,
but beaks get broken in war, don't they?

647
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,319
- Do they?
- Yeah, they do.

648
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,999
We're not about protecting beaks,
we're about blowing them off.

649
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,719
Yeah?

650
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,359
Well, go and unload the van.
I'm not doing all the work.

651
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,799
Waj! Waj!

652
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,479
Anti-surveillance.

653
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,999
Not you, mate, you're still here.
Get in there.

654
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,079
- What are you doing?
- Just in case they're taking pictures.

655
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,839
- What?
- Barry says you come out blurry.

656
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,479
Right, stop it!

657
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,639
Stop it!

658
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,399
CCTV's a video.

659
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,479
You're just gonna look
like a bunch of Sufis on speed.

660
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,559
Next time Barry tells you
to do something, don't.

661
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,199
- You all right, Alice? How's it going.
- All right, Wasim? Yeah.

662
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,919
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

663
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,119
- All right, Jason?
- All right.

664
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,599
Who's this one?

665
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,039
This is... Claude.

666
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,359
Claude, this is Alice.
She's got the flat next door.

667
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,719
- Hello, Claude.
- Hi.

668
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,559
- What's this?
- Claude's the new member of our band.

669
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,119
- Band?
- He's the new member.

670
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,559
- I used to be in a band.
- Did you?

671
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,959
Yeah.
Until all the birds fell off the roof...

672
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,919
I don't know if you remember.

673
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,639
All right, then, Alice,
we'll see you later. Come on, lads.

674
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,759
Come through.

675
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,399
- Which one are you?
- Er, Claude.

676
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,519
- Claude?
- Yeah.

677
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,199
Are you French?

678
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,439
Yeah.

679
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,679
See you.

680
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,239
Right, Mister Newsman
in the newsroom, after three.

681
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,359
Three, two, one...

682
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,399
Yes, it was us.

683
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,439
We have struck you
where you least expected it.

684
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,999
We have bombed the mosque.

685
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,879
Only in the days of the final jihad...

686
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,519
What are you doing here?

687
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,919
Well, you told us to come round.

688
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,319
We've just come through the back.
Anti-surveillance, like you said.

689
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,239
Right, well, I'm doing my tape.

690
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,119
But we're not bombing the mosque.

691
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,999
- What?
- We're not bombing the mosque.

692
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,559
Look, I'm just doing this tape in case
the plans change to bomb the mosque.

693
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,079
If they did change, isn't the whole
point of it to blame it on the kuffar

694
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,599
and not take responsibility for it?

695
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,839
What do you know about it?
It was my idea in the first place, not yours!

696
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,479
Now, fuck off!
I'm doing my tape. Go on.

697
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,599
All right, Barry?

698
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,079
- What, you're here as well?
- Yeah. Why? What's going on?

699
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,839
He said he was going to bomb
the mosque.

700
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,399
- Did you say that, Barry?
- No.

701
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,119
- Yeah, you did.
- No, I didn't.

702
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,999
- What did you say, then?
- I said I was gonna bomb something else.

703
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,799
What did you say you were gonna bomb?

704
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,839
Hm?

705
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,559
Fuck off!

706
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,079
Fuck off out of my house!

707
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,199
Oh, Barry, you moron.

708
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,879
- Salaam, Ahmed.
- Alaykum salaam.

709
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,279
- Omar, it's your brother. Come in.
- No, I'm OK.

710
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,199
Just come in and sit down.

711
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,679
- Salaam Alaykum.
- Alaykum salaam.

712
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,239
Just come in and sit down.

713
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,479
I'm not in the same room.
You can come in.

714
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,159
You are.

715
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,679
I'm not.

716
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,479
The wall has been taken out, so you are.

717
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,319
Have you come to drop some fatwas,
cos we've just had the carpet cleaned?

718
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,079
Not in this house, bro.

719
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,439
- Freeze or I'll blow your guts out.
- All right, go easy.

720
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,799
OK. Right, come on!

721
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,479
You've got 30 seconds!

722
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,759
- What are you teaching him, Omar?
- It's a water pistol. Have you lost it?

723
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,439
Have you got 150 quotes from scholars
saying we can't squirt a water pistol?

724
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,839
There is no justification
for what you are planning.

725
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,919
- What am I planning, bro?
- You tell me.

726
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,999
- Want to know what I am planning?
- Yeah.

727
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,359
Sure you can handle it, bro?
Yeah? You ready?

728
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,919
It's not a proper plan yet, yeah?

729
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,719
But I'm thinking, inshallah,

730
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,479
I'm going to go upstairs
and run a hot bath, right?

731
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,839
Then come back down
and make beans on toast. I'm proper hungry.

732
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,479
- Very funny.
- What?

733
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,919
Is it, bro? Have you got opinions to back that up?

734
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,079
I have got 18 opinions, all very good ones.

735
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,599
You know what? It's not Top Trumps.
Muslims are getting pasted and you go,

736
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,239
"I've got 60,000 opinions
saying we can't fight back.

737
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,199
"We must measure our beard with a ruler
and lock our wives in cupboard!"

738
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,119
That's not a joke, is it, bro?

739
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,959
It is not a cupboard, it is a small room.

740
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,199
Oh, come on. It was a flipping toilet
till you took the china out.

741
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,879
I don't argue with women.

742
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,599
No, you don't.
You lock 'em in a cupboard.

743
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,079
Omar, your wife is out of control.

744
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,119
I don't know how to control her.
Help me out.

745
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,319
Am I... Am I out of control? Ooh.

746
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,799
Do it again. He won't fight back.

747
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,799
- What am I like? I'm out of control.
- Obey me, wife. Obey me.

748
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,039
Go and do it.

749
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,639
Fight back, brother!

750
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,239
What's all the violence, brother?

751
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,119
- Are you fighting back? In self-defence?
- This is not fighting.

752
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,799
- By the law of Sharia, I am not fighting.
- You're a proper Mujahid!

753
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,199
By the law...

754
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,639
- I am not fighting.
- You're so violent, bro!

755
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,279
Hey, Omar.

756
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,959
- You're terrible, you are.
- I'm out of control.

757
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,479
Aren't you, eh?

758
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,599
- That's twice as much, bro.
- This one's gonna leave a mark.

759
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,199
Just drop it.

760
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,039
Ooh!

761
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,119
Shit, man!

762
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,199
- Come on, bro. Give me that.
- Jew.

763
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,639
Gay.

764
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,439
Fed.

765
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,679
Sodomite.

766
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,439
Gynaecologist.

767
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,199
Innocent bloke. Doesn't exist.

768
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,119
Leonard Cohen.
Here, you give me that.

769
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,279
You do some work.

770
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,519
This one's gonna be
like a grenade, man.

771
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,319
- Oh, bro.
- Here, watch this.

772
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,999
Watch this, bro!

773
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,679
Come on, lads. Why don't we just
pick up the phone and call the cops?

774
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,679
Right? Come on.

775
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,159
- Sorry, man.
- Sorry, bro.

776
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,119
We don't have to use that
on ourselves, do we, Barry?

777
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,319
- Course we do, bro.
- But it's our choice, right?

778
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,519
- Fess? Fess?
- What?

779
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,599
It is your choice.
Right? It can only be your choice.

780
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,079
Right, yeah.

781
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,199
- Fess. Fess.
- What?

782
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,679
It is your choice, right,

783
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,119
but you've chosen
to blow yourself up, haven't you?

784
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,119
Haven't you?

785
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,399
Mashallah, brother Crow.

786
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,039
Mashallah.

787
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,159
You're doing this, right,
to save brother Faisal.

788
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,959
And I know it's come
as a bit of a shock to you,

789
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,439
but everything will be all right.

790
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,519
Yeah? OK.
You see that over there?

791
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,639
That...

792
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,959
That's a sex shop. Right?

793
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,239
A US embassy,
or some other such slag utility.

794
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,999
Right, now wait there.

795
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,439
When I say, you fly to the target.

796
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,599
When I dial this,
you go to heaven, brother Crow.

797
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,959
Inshallah.

798
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,599
Yeah.

799
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,759
What's that?
What's that, Mrs Thistle?

800
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,719
No, I don't want to resit
my media studies.

801
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,959
Stupid Mrs Thistle,
I don't want to retake it.

802
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,119
You know why?
Cos I've found a new purpose in life.

803
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,479
And here it is. Eat that shit!

804
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,719
Eat that. Eat that. You fuck...

805
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,119
Come on, lads. Let's go.
Salaam alaykum.

806
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,559
- Alaykum salaam.
- You all right? Where are they?

807
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,559
They've all gone, man.
They're using the fireworks for cover.

808
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,679
Yeah, I know that. That was my idea.
Why didn't they wait for me?

809
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,359
- Barry said that you said, "Go ahead."
- Did he?

810
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,679
- I'm just on night shift.
- Yeah, you are, bro.

811
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,079
If anybody comes knocking for Barry,
tell them you used to know him...

812
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,159
Can I come?

813
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,399
Don't drop it, you prick!

814
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,959
Brother Faisal, if you drop this,
we're baked beans from here to Derby.

815
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,799
- Slowly, slowly.
- Oh!

816
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,919
- It's good.
- All right.

817
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,119
- Good, good.
- Let's get out of here.

818
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,919
- OK.
- Come on. I'm gonna blow it.

819
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,719
- Ready?
- All right.

820
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,639
Is it gonna be loud?

821
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,399
Did you see that?

822
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,799
Fucking good, Barry. Fucking good.
That were proper good!

823
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,759
- Well done, Barry.
- What's up?

824
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,999
Did you miss it, bro?
Did you miss it, bro?

825
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,559
I told you before, Barry, didn't I?
What were you lads playing at?

826
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,719
- Why didn't you call me, Waj? Eh?
- I didn't have no credit.

827
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,519
This breaks anti-surveillance protocol.
We shouldn't be back here till tomorrow.

828
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,239
The protocol is that you were supposed
to stay here and guard the flat, Barry,

829
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,279
cos there's a good chance
that you are being monitored.

830
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,799
Is that an Islamic argument, brother?
I only listen to Islamic arguments.

831
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,839
That was my microwave, Barry.
I had it ten years, that Matsui.

832
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,319
I should've been there.

833
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,519
Your microwave
has been well sacrificed.

834
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,999
Don't screw with my jihad.
I'm telling you for the last time.

835
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,639
- Your jihad? You said "my jihad".
- Our jihad. Don't screw with it.

836
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,519
- Our jihad.
- What did he say, Fess?

837
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,879
- Did he say "my jihad"?
- What difference does it make?

838
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,639
- You said "my jihad".
- So what? This is such a small thing.

839
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,959
Hey!

840
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,599
Come and have a look at this.

841
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,479
♪ Dancing in the moonlight

842
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,119
♪ Everybody's feeling warm and bright...

843
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,519
Hass!

844
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,759
Claude!

845
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,119
Shit!

846
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,599
Right, it's time to go now, Alice.

847
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,759
Why? What's going on?

848
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,439
Nothing. We just need you to go.

849
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,599
Oh.

850
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,519
Oh, I get it.
I know what's going on here.

851
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,519
I know what you lot are.

852
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,719
You lot...

853
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,759
are a bunch of Paki-bashers.

854
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,679
- What?
- Mountie boys. Gays.

855
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,559
- Yes, we are so gay.
- I'm not.

856
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,159
Yes, you are. We all are.

857
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,959
But mainly it's these two.
Isn't it, Norman?

858
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,399
- Yes.
- Yeah, you love it, don't you?

859
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,199
We've got to get down
to some gay business now, all of us.

860
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,239
You lot aren't my friends any more.

861
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,879
Safe, is he?

862
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,999
She didn't see anything, man.
I swear to God, she didn't see the...

863
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,719
The bolts and the...
I'll sort this out.

864
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,479
I'll sort it out, man.
Just give me a minute.

865
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,159
I'll go down and sort this shit out.

866
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,359
You are going to sort it out
cos you're going to kill her.

867
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,479
Kill her?

868
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,319
We're gonna kill her?

869
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,279
Not us, Waj. Hass.

870
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,639
You want me to kill her?

871
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,519
What, you can fuck her but you can't kill her?
What's wrong with you?

872
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,799
Give him your pocket knife, Barry.

873
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,839
There we go. There. Knife and fork.
Make a fucking meal of it.

874
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,599
I'm not joking, bro.
Do I look like I'm joking?

875
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,279
No. Now go on your way.

876
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,159
How do I do it?

877
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,919
Cut her head off
and bring it back in a bucket.

878
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,599
Chop her head off?

879
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,599
We're not really gonna kill her, are we?
You fucking idiot!

880
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,599
Why don't we just call up the pigs
and dob ourselves in.

881
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,319
That'd be clever.
A body on our hands to trail back to us.

882
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,719
Shut up!

883
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,559
What are we gonna do with all this?

884
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,639
She's seen it now.
We've got to move it now.

885
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,039
- We're gonna put it in Barry's allotment.
- We'll put it...

886
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,959
Shut up, Barry. Solved.
Problem solved.

887
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,919
Daddy's come home
and wiped everyone's arse, hasn't he?

888
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,679
That's what jihad's about.
It's me wiping your arses.

889
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,719
Oh, sorry. One minute. Hello, Gaza?

890
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,399
Yeah, Omar would love to come
and help but he can't, he's really busy

891
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,839
wiping up the fountains of shit
spraying out the arses of these...

892
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,919
OK, thank you.

893
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,279
Who were on the phone?

894
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,399
Slow down, please.

895
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,839
Get us there in one piece, Barry.
Go easy.

896
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,879
Go easy!

897
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,879
Oh! Oh!

898
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,199
Don't rattle the stuff, Barry.
Slow down, man.

899
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,919
Use your eyes, boys.
We've got a predator.

900
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,319
What, the milk float?

901
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,399
- That's a milk float!
- The Feds work undercover, you mug!

902
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,679
No, no.

903
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,799
No, no!

904
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,599
No, don't do this to me!

905
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,079
Come on!

906
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,839
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck!

907
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,519
Fuck, fuck, fuck it!

908
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,399
- Did you fix this, then, Barry?
- Yes, I fixed it!

909
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,079
- Did you?
- It's the parts. They're Jewish.

910
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,159
What parts in a car are Jewish?

911
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,559
- Spark plugs?
- Spark plugs.

912
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,799
Jews invented spark plugs
to control global traffic.

913
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,639
Right, everybody calm down.
We're gonna grab the gear and walk.

914
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,119
All right, but check the roofs, boys.
There could still be an ambush.

915
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,839
Careful, careful with that. Watch out.

916
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,759
Easy does it. Just act natural. OK?

917
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,359
One jolt and this stuff could go, right?

918
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,839
You got to run smooth, right?

919
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,479
You got to run fast,
but you got to run smooth, right?

920
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,959
Like this, right?

921
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,559
This is fast but slow,
smooth but fast.

922
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,999
Barry, we're fine! Lads, we're fine!
There's no need for any of this.

923
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,719
We're fine, are we?
We're fucking surrounded. Look.

924
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,639
- Everybody get off the road.
- Omar!

925
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,719
Anybody talks, I'm gonna make them
jump up and down till they go bang.

926
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,359
Just keep your mouths shut
and let me deal with this, all right?

927
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,119
Hey, man. How's it going?

928
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,479
Nice little one-pack
you got going on there, bro.

929
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,879
You're a pint of sauce, Omar.

930
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,079
Have you managed to run a mile yet
without stopping for a milkshake?

931
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,039
- Make that 12 miles, Mr Khan. All right, lads?
- All right.

932
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,199
What's with the bags?

933
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,399
- Shopping.
- Marzipan.

934
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,719
- Toys.
- Chicken.

935
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,079
- We're about to go and play football.
- Yeah?

936
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,319
We should grab all this kit
and head down there to the pitch.

937
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,119
- Yeah.
- All right, bro.

938
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,719
Right. See you in a bit, man.

939
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,919
Hey, lads. Wait, look.
You forgot this.

940
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,599
- Hey! Hey!
- Aahh!

941
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,199
What's that?

942
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,239
That bag's full of really fragile...

943
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,279
boots.

944
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,879
- Are they all right?
- Yeah. That's just thigh exercises.

945
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,119
- What?
- Quad squats. You know, squat jogs.

946
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,479
It's just... It's for the marathon.
I thought you'd know.

947
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,519
- Yeah? Squat jogs?
- Yeah.

948
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,639
All right, man. See you in a bit.

949
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,879
Like that.

950
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,639
- Squat jogs, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

951
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,919
- Down?
- Bit lower.

952
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,759
- Safe-age, mate!
- All right, man.

953
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,919
- Take care, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

954
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,079
- All right, brothers?
- Oh, Alhamdulillah, bro.

955
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,399
- Yeah.
- We skilled it.

956
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,519
Where's Faisal?

957
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,119
Hey, boys.
Boys, come and have a look at this.

958
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,679
Can you see him?

959
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,199
Hey, bro!

960
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,639
Run!

961
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,479
Hey, brother Faisal!

962
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,919
Over the wall, Faisal!

963
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,199
- Yeah, run faster, bro!
- Yeah, but not too fast!

964
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,279
Where is he?

965
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,279
- It was a martyr's death.
- Gone to paradise, innit, brother Omar?

966
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,319
- He disrupted the infrastructure.
- How did he do that?

967
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,159
He took out a sheep.

968
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,879
Magnificently took it right out.

969
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,279
Did he?

970
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,799
- Attacked the food supply.
- Some of it's in there... with him.

971
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,639
- What?
- I couldn't separate it.

972
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:22,079
So what is he, lads?
Is he a martyr or is he a fucking jalfrezi?

973
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,919
- He's a martyr.
- Right, this is bullshit!

974
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,519
- He is not a martyr.
- Yes, he is. He's part of the war.

975
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,159
What war?
The war on kuffar sheep?

976
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,599
- He's the first hero of the final jihad.
- He's not a hero, he's a dickhead.

977
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,839
And so are you, you're all dickheads.

978
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,639
Whoa, brother. That is out of order.

979
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,279
I've made a decision, Barry.
The mission's off.

980
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,319
It's finished, I'm done with this.

981
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,399
You can't handle the war, brother.
You're having a wobble.

982
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,959
I've got nothing to have a wobble about.
My conscience is clear.

983
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,799
- You're the one who killed Faisal!
- I didn't kill him!

984
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,879
Yes, you did, you brought TV Paki in

985
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,799
after you saw him
making an arse out of himself

986
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,279
at a public meeting
you shouldn't even have been at.

987
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,839
And he blew our cover.

988
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,999
Ever since then,
you've had everybody so paranoid,

989
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,719
poor little Faisal's
panicked himself to death.

990
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,559
- So really Hassan killed him.
- No, you killed him.

991
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,919
No, you killed him.
You heard what he said.

992
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,199
- You killed him more.
- I thought it was a good thing he died.

993
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,319
Isn't he a martyr?
It's a good thing, right?

994
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,679
All right, I did kill him, then.

995
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,719
I martyred him. He's up there now,
keeping my seat warm.

996
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,119
- Come on, our kid, let's go.
- I think I martyred him a bit, too.

997
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,879
What?

998
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,999
- We got to keep on.
- You got a plan, Waj?

999
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,599
- Blow something up.
- What are we going to blow up, Waj?

1000
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,879
Internet.

1001
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,839
We'll blow up the internet
for brother Faisal.

1002
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,599
We're mujahid, brother, yeah?

1003
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,119
Rubber Dinghy Rapids, yeah?

1004
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,319
You're not a mujahid.
You're a fucking idiot.

1005
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,639
Do you think a real mujahid gives a fuck
about Rubber Dinghy Rapids

1006
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,919
and gets his deen from
The Cat That Went To Mecca,

1007
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,759
a book he can't finish
cos it's far too fucking advanced for him?

1008
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,639
I tell you what, I've got a plan for you.
Why don't you go with...

1009
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,519
...and lose yourself in the forest?

1010
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,599
Omar!

1011
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,959
Salaam, Omar.

1012
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,719
Salaam alaykum, bro.

1013
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,079
You and your boys look like...
something rubbish.

1014
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,119
You all right, Omar?

1015
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,399
Yeah, yeah. I am, as it goes.

1016
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,439
- Listen, can I ask you something?
- Why not, brother?

1017
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,799
Screw it, doesn't matter.
You've already started doing the face.

1018
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,839
Why not come to our study group, Omar?

1019
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,519
What, and get a four-hour dose of that face?

1020
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,239
The floaty face of the wise bird,
hovering on a million quotes,

1021
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,399
about to do a massive wisdom shit on my head.

1022
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,919
Forget it.

1023
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,639
Omar, what are you doing?
It's the middle of the night.

1024
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,159
What is that?

1025
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,319
- It's a puffin party.
- A what?

1026
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,319
- It's a puffin party.
- A puffin party?

1027
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,159
- I'm talking to Waj's puffin.
- Omar, what are you talking about?

1028
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,839
It's the boys. I've left them.

1029
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,159
Now Hassan's puffin won't talk to me,
Waj's puffin's just told me to piss off,

1030
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,159
Barry's puffin's turned all red
and is hiding under the pirate hat.

1031
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,319
Faisal's dead.

1032
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,439
He's dead. They...

1033
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,959
He was carrying explosives
and he tripped up over a sheep.

1034
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,559
They're total idiots, Sof.

1035
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,159
Well, it must have been God's plan
for him to be blown up on a sheep.

1036
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,639
Come on, Sof.
How can that be God's plan?

1037
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,839
Well, it can't be God's plan
to leave the lads with Barry, can it?

1038
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,359
Come here.

1039
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,039
You were much more fun
when you were gonna blow yourself up, love.

1040
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,079
I am gonna blow myself up, right?

1041
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,279
Just not in a mosque
or in a chemist's or on top of a duck.

1042
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,319
Right, well, if they're gonna blow
themselves up in the wrong place,

1043
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,879
you've got to make sure
you all blow up in the right place.

1044
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,319
Sof, I can't even get them to stir their tea
without smashing a window.

1045
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,079
What does your heart say, hmm?

1046
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,919
God's in your heart, Dad.

1047
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,239
Oi, you, come here.

1048
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,559
Sorry, I heard talking.

1049
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,359
Can we finish off
the story about Simba's jihad?

1050
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,959
Yeah, we can do that tomorrow.
Come on, off to bed.

1051
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,919
Does he become a martyr, eh, Dad?

1052
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,959
Don't you worry,
cos even if he gets blown to bits,

1053
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,479
he's gonna die smiling.

1054
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,799
- He'll go straight to heaven.
- Yeah.

1055
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,479
He'll be in heaven
before his head hits the ceiling.

1056
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:14,759
An Asian man's head was found less
than 2 miles from the city centre today.

1057
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,879
Steven Fap discovered
the Asian man's head

1058
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,719
when it nearly fell onto his dog out of a tree.

1059
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,359
A head fell out of the tree
and nearly hit my dog.

1060
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,439
The man has not been identified,

1061
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,999
but it seems that he may have died
while trying to cause an explosion.

1062
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,279
- Yo, Matt... Is Matt here?
- He's in the back.

1063
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,399
- Terry, step outside, bro.
- Say that again.

1064
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,199
I need you to go outside.
Get a doughnut.

1065
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:48,559
- I've got one.
- Get another one.

1066
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,999
- Matt?
- Oh, thanks!

1067
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,239
- Omar?
- Yeah, mate.

1068
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,999
- Can you can help me with this?
- I got to ask you something first.

1069
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,999
I booked a clown and they gave me this.

1070
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,599
It's the wrong way up.
I can't run in a wrong-way-up clown!

1071
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,039
They said, "You ordered it."

1072
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,159
- Why would I order a wrong-way-up clown?
- It's fine.

1073
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,599
- I can sort you out.
- I didn't even know what one was.

1074
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,359
I can sort you out with another costume
so you can do the marathon.

1075
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,639
I said, "You're gonna cause
a pile-up at the marathon with me

1076
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,679
"flat to my arse in a costume
I can't even bloody believe exists."

1077
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,119
I've got you a rabbit costume at home.
You can run the marathon in that.

1078
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,879
- Can I run in a rabbit?
- Course you can.

1079
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,519
It's amazing. It's a rabbit, right?
Panic over. Done?

1080
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,599
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- I've got to ask you something.

1081
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,559
Have you?
Have you seen the news?

1082
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,719
- Yeah, the head.
- What do you know about that?

1083
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,199
Well, they're just saying it's jihadi.

1084
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,759
They've got him.
Filmed him blowing up a crow.

1085
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,559
Its not jihadi, though, is it, Omar,
blowing up a crow?

1086
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,359
Omar?

1087
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,079
No, it's a cultural thing. We bazooka-ed
an ostrich at that wedding I was at.

1088
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,559
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I... I've got to go, Matt.

1089
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:54,959
Shit!

1090
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,319
God help us.

1091
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,119
- That's the police, man.
- All right. Arm yourselves.

1092
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,879
All right?

1093
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,959
- Oi.
- Get out of my way, Barry.

1094
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,159
Oi! Fuck off out the back door!
You're not part of this now.

1095
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,959
Lads, this is an emergency.
They found Faisal's head.

1096
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,759
The head that you buried 5 feet
underneath your shed

1097
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,599
fell out of a tree onto a dog.

1098
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,519
Good. Dogs contradict Islam.

1099
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,199
Dibble is onto us, lads.

1100
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,839
- Dibble is on to us.
- I told you, it was a knee.

1101
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,759
That was a head.
It was obviously a head.

1102
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:32,999
It had a hinge!

1103
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,039
Right. So, I've just seen Matt.

1104
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,479
Matt is running
the London marathon tomorrow.

1105
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,079
He's doing it in costume.

1106
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,039
You know they run in costume?
Well, so can we.

1107
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,879
We can disguise the gear in there
and it's perfect.

1108
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,719
We've got live TV,
prime targets all along the road.

1109
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,759
We've got a target, Omar.
It's the mosque.

1110
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,879
When you meet God,

1111
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,519
do you want to tell him,
"I struck a blow for the brothers"?

1112
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,239
- Or "I blew a load of them up"?
- Blew a load of 'em up. He'll love that.

1113
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,599
Come on, lads. Waj?

1114
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,879
I'm not on your side any more, brother Omar.

1115
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,239
- You ripped me up, bro.
- Mashallah.

1116
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,759
Waj, bro...

1117
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,919
I'm really sorry.

1118
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,279
My head was in a mess cos of Faisal.

1119
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,559
I should've stayed.

1120
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,559
Why didn't you, then?

1121
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,159
Cos I made a mistake.

1122
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,399
But you didn't. You listened to your heart
and you did the right thing.

1123
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,839
No, ignore him, Waj. He's being nice.

1124
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,279
You cannot win an argument
just by being nice.

1125
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,999
Not just by being nice, Baz.
I'm right as well, aren't I?

1126
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,199
You cannot win an argument
just by being right.

1127
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,039
- No?
- No. No way.

1128
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,199
- I think maybe you can, Barry?
- Who asked you, fuck-brain?

1129
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,199
Barry's not a good emir, brother Omar.

1130
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,959
He made me do bad stuff in the woods.

1131
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,479
Like what?

1132
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,559
He said, if I was a proper mujahid,

1133
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,479
I'd wiz in my own mouth.

1134
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,719
You made him wee in his own gob?

1135
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,519
What is wrong with you, bro?

1136
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,159
It's submission.
It's the rules of submission.

1137
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,519
It felt really bad, brother.

1138
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,759
It's not too tricky
once you get the aim right,

1139
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,759
but it just feels like really proper wrong.

1140
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,239
All wee splashing off your teeth.

1141
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:35,639
Bro, I swear, bro,
I may ask you to blow yourself up

1142
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,239
but I will never ask you
to piss in your own mouth.

1143
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,519
- Yeah?
- Yeah, bro. Promise.

1144
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,359
- No more widdle in my gob.
- Promise, bro.

1145
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,159
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

1146
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,079
Rubber Dinghy Rapids, brother.

1147
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,799
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

1148
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,799
See this, brother Hass?

1149
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,439
It's gays at work.
It's not Muslims, it's gays.

1150
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,439
OK, brother Hass,
marathon or mosque?

1151
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,399
- Either way, we're gonna blow, right?
- Yeah, to pieces, brother.

1152
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,799
Yeah, but... we die smiling, bro.

1153
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,799
Yeah, wicked.

1154
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,439
Wicked. Yeah, man.

1155
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,879
Let's blow up a load offit slags
at the marathon, yeah?

1156
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,959
Oh, yes!

1157
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,599
Yes, bro.

1158
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,159
Wicked. Yes!

1159
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,799
Come on, Barry. We're lions, bro.

1160
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,479
- Four lions.
- Yes!

1161
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,439
Good lad.

1162
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,399
Down on the floor!

1163
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,559
I'll be two minutes.

1164
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,959
What's it concerning?

1165
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,279
We trying to ascertain the whereabouts
of your brother-in-law.

1166
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,399
Why, what's up?

1167
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,679
Tell us when you saw him last.

1168
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,719
Well...

1169
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,439
I can't remember
the last time I saw him.

1170
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,639
Right, nurse, still on shift? Sorry.

1171
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,879
So, I've got the stats back
from cubicle seven.

1172
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,719
They need some more blood supplies
for the knee.

1173
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,839
The what?

1174
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,599
Yes, the knee string.
The knee string's come off.

1175
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,719
Hm.

1176
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,759
I've finished my shift now.

1177
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,719
So I'm going to take my team
up to the top floor.

1178
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,999
- Right?
- OK.

1179
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,599
So I'll see you up there.

1180
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,679
Yeah?

1181
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,679
- OK.
- Yeah?

1182
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,399
You all right, lads.
You going to arrest me?

1183
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,799
- No, no.
- Carry on.

1184
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,679
OK.

1185
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,879
Right, so your brother-in-law,
when was the last time you saw him?

1186
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,479
Er, like I said, about two months ago.

1187
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,479
♪ Dancing in the moonlight

1188
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,039
♪ Everybody's feeling warm and bright

1189
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,639
♪ Such a fine and natural sight

1190
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,159
♪ Everybody's dancing in the moonlight...

1191
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,319
Come on lads, we're late.

1192
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,719
- Is it all right?
- It's all right there now.

1193
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,919
- Yeah.
- Right, we're nearly done, our kid.

1194
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,519
Yeah, nearly done.

1195
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,119
- OK?
- Yeah.

1196
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,239
Mujahid, brothers!

1197
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,279
- Mujahid.
- Mujahid, brother Hassan.

1198
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,599
Mujahid!

1199
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,679
Defo right thing, yeah, bro?

1200
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,119
What?

1201
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,439
Blowing up kuffar and that?

1202
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,799
- Totally legit, yeah?
- Yeah.

1203
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,319
Good. Wicked.

1204
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,519
I was just... just checking and that.

1205
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,759
Waj, don't listen to your brain, bro.

1206
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,279
OK? The shaitan,
he gets in there with his wasa-wasa.

1207
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,079
What you've got to do,
you've got to listen to your heart. Remember?

1208
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,799
- My heart. Yeah, brother Omar.
- So, what does your heart say?

1209
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,599
It says, er...

1210
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,719
"It's wrong, Waj, don't do it."

1211
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,959
And what does your brain say?

1212
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,439
"We're here...

1213
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,199
"...together, strapped up,

1214
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,159
"and it would be, like,
well pathetic to cop out now."

1215
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,359
Right, um...

1216
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,079
- So he should listen to his brain.
- No, he's got to listen to his heart, Barry.

1217
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,719
Anyway, this is Waj's brain.
Since when do we listen to Waj's brain?

1218
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,079
- Sorry, bro.
- No, I agree. I'm thick as fudge.

1219
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,879
His brain says do it,
so his brain's got to be right!

1220
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,159
That can't be his brain, right?
That's his heart, Barry.

1221
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,879
- Feels like my brain, brother.
- OK, this is what's happened.

1222
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,199
What's happened is,
the shaitan has confused you.

1223
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,599
He's swapped round
your brain and your heart.

1224
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:24,159
So, don't listen
to what you think is your heart,

1225
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,079
cos that's actually your brain -

1226
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,959
in disguise as your heart.

1227
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,879
Right? And what you thought
was your brain,

1228
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,999
that's... that's your heart.

1229
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,719
That's actually your heart.

1230
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,519
My brain is my heart.

1231
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,079
You got it, our kid. So just...

1232
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,599
What's up there?

1233
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,799
Heart.

1234
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,759
OK? Yeah? Follow your heart.

1235
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,199
Nice one, brother.

1236
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,919
- Right?
- Nice one. Alhamdulillah.

1237
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,959
- Hey, hey!
- What?

1238
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,879
Oh, behn choad!

1239
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,799
We're doing a fun run for a kid's charity.

1240
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,959
Stretches, stretches, stretches.

1241
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,279
- We're running for charity.
- What kind of charity?

1242
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,879
- For kids.
- What kind of kids?

1243
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,119
Policemen's kids.

1244
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,559
You all right, officer?

1245
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,119
- Late for the fun run, lads?
- What's it to you?

1246
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:18,279
Yeah, we are, actually. Do you know
how we can get to the red zone?

1247
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,479
You can't run in that, can you?

1248
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,879
He just drew the short straw.

1249
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,959
Four short straws were there?

1250
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,719
Red zone? It's back down there, left.

1251
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,599
Second left again, then there's marshals.
They'll tell you where to park.

1252
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,119
Thank you.

1253
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,959
You're gonna die in that gear, lads.

1254
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,679
- That's more than likely.
- Proper likely.

1255
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,799
We're all going to die, yeah.

1256
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,079
It's all for a good cause, though.

1257
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,639
Well, good luck.

1258
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,039
Have a good day.

1259
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,119
Everybody OK?
Everybody strapped up?

1260
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:06,599
Got your detonator on?
Hass, you got your number?

1261
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,399
Hass, have you got your number?

1262
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,239
Hey!

1263
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,039
- Where the fuck has he gone?
- Shit!

1264
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,559
What the fuck's he doing?

1265
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,319
Help! Help!

1266
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,559
- I'm accidentally a suicide bomber!
- Stop!

1267
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,839
- I've got a bomb!
- He's bottled it.

1268
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,039
It's the costume.
The legs make the hands go up.

1269
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:26,079
- I've got a bomb but it's a mistake!
- No, he said he's got a bomb.

1270
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,119
- You've got a bomb?
- Yeah, but I'm not a bomber!

1271
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,439
Don't worry.

1272
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,559
- This is a fucking bad prank, mate!
- No, no!

1273
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,439
No, I'm real, but not any more.

1274
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,719
You're real but not any more?

1275
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,839
I don't understand.
Have you got a bomb?

1276
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,599
Yes, but it's not going to go off.

1277
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,199
- How do I know that?
- Look.

1278
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,239
We've got to go, now.

1279
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,679
We need to go, now.

1280
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,599
Now!

1281
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,519
Go! Come on, go!

1282
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,279
Waj, try and find some targets.
I'll see you on the top floor, our kid.

1283
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,799
Radisson-style penthouse suite!

1284
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,119
Smooth running, Waj.

1285
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,599
"Smooth running, Waj.
Smooth running."

1286
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,999
- You killed Hassan!
- He bottled.

1287
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,359
You took away his choice.
You de-martyred him.

1288
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,319
Did Waj have a choice
when you told him

1289
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,679
his heart was his brain
and his gob was his ring piece?

1290
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,359
You tomatoed your friend.

1291
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,999
- Barry...
- You've killed the special-needs donkey.

1292
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,359
No, I haven't.

1293
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,599
Let him blow!

1294
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,719
Let the retard blow!

1295
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,879
Fuck!

1296
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,239
Oi, you, stop!

1297
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,479
All right, bro?

1298
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,679
Hey!

1299
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,439
Stay there!

1300
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,199
I'm fucking loaded! Yeah?

1301
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,919
No messing now, yeah?

1302
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,799
That's it. Stay there.

1303
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,359
Shut it. Shut the metal. Shut it.

1304
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,719
Shut it!

1305
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,119
Right, lads. See this, yeah?

1306
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,519
Any of you do anything,

1307
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,439
we're all turning baked beans, all right?

1308
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,559
No fucking messing now. Yeah?

1309
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,639
Target confirmations are
ostrich and grizzly bear.

1310
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,759
Ostrich and grizzly bear are the targets.

1311
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,599
The bear is down. Repeat,
the bear is down. I got the bear.

1312
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,919
I think that's a wookie.
That's a wookie.

1313
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,359
No, it's not, it's a bear.

1314
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,039
Is a wookie a bear, control?

1315
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,759
The bear target has changed.
Target bear is now target Honey Monster.

1316
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,039
Is a honey monster a bear?

1317
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,519
A honey monster is not a bear.

1318
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,959
A honey monster is a bear.

1319
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,599
The honey monster is down.
He was a target. He was a bear.

1320
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,919
The honey monster is down?

1321
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,199
The honey monster is not down, control.
We have a wookie down.

1322
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,999
- What's a wookie?
- A bear. It's a bear!

1323
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,919
No, it is a wookie.
You've just shot it as a bear.

1324
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,479
- Is a wookie a bear?
- It's a bear. Repeat, it's a bear.

1325
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,599
The wookie is down.
The wookie is not the target.

1326
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,519
Well, it must be the target.
I just shot it.

1327
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,999
I'll just finish this,
then we're all off to heaven, all right?

1328
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,959
Martyrs' suite, VIP lounge.

1329
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,359
Are you going to kill us?

1330
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,879
Well, I might have some seconds,
but I kind of am, yeah.

1331
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:37,799
Why?

1332
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,639
For jihad, man. Kuffar and that.

1333
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,199
But we support jihad, bro.

1334
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,919
I can't explain it, lads, but...

1335
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,079
If brother Omar were here,

1336
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,679
I swear he'd tell you knowledge
proper good.

1337
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,719
- Omar?
- Waj?

1338
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,399
- Are you in paradise, bro?
- No, bro.

1339
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,199
- I'm in a cafe. Where are you?
- I'm in a kebab shop.

1340
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,479
I've got hostages and everything,
like Xbox Counter-Strike.

1341
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,039
- Right, listen, Waj. You've got to...
- Thing is, they're all brothers.

1342
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:29,159
I still get points for taking them with me,
though, yeah? Like Nectar card?

1343
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,799
Omar?

1344
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,039
- Let them all go. Just keep one of them.
- Eh?

1345
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,679
Just grab one of them.
Let the rest of them go, Waj.

1346
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,919
OK.

1347
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,559
Right, you stay.

1348
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,079
You three can go.

1349
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,239
Go!

1350
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,439
OK. Now listen, Waj.

1351
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,879
What you were saying before
about this being wrong,

1352
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,559
you were right, it is wrong.

1353
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,479
- I don't... What do you mean?
- For you.

1354
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,719
For you, Waj,
doing what you're doing is wrong.

1355
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,199
Yeah, I know. It feels really wrong, bro.
But that's why it's right, yeah?

1356
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,159
No, you're confused, bro.

1357
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,679
I'm not confused, brother.

1358
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,479
Yes, you are confused.
I confused you.

1359
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,599
But when I'm confused,
I got my confused face.

1360
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,999
Wait.

1361
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:25,439
Bro, I just took a picture of my face.
It's defo not my confused face.

1362
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,439
- Waj, I don't need...
- I'll send it you.

1363
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,359
Waj. Waj, wait.

1364
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,079
Listen to me, Waj. Wait.

1365
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,279
"Listen to me." It's too late
to stick your hand up his arse now.

1366
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,759
Aargh!

1367
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,999
Oh!

1368
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,279
Ah, look at the Paki Bono.

1369
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,759
You want to call him?

1370
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,759
You want to call
the special-needs donkey?

1371
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,359
Here you go.

1372
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,079
You forgot the SIM card.

1373
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,319
Mind out. Mind out the way.

1374
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,479
Easy, chap. OK.

1375
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,279
It's all right, I can Heimlich.
That's it, don't fight me.

1376
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,559
- Wait.
- I've done this before, sonny.

1377
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:10,959
That's it. Don't fight it.

1378
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,519
That's it, that's it.

1379
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,279
And catch the peanut!

1380
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,439
Number withheld.
I don't do "number withheld".

1381
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,039
Answer it, bro.
It could be important!

1382
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,359
Hey, yeah. Maybe I won an iPhone.

1383
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,439
- Waj?
- Have I won?

1384
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,119
Waj, this is Ed.
I'm with Special Branch. I'm just outside.

1385
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:56,119
- How did you get this number?
- Waj, can we talk?

1386
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:59,039
- Have you got agents at Orange?
- I'm sorry?

1387
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:02,799
You've got proper double agents
working at Orange, haven't you?

1388
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,759
I knew I should have gone to O2.
I've got loads offriends on O2.

1389
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,599
Waj, what are your demands?

1390
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,999
I don't have any.

1391
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,599
Excuse me, mate. Have you got
a SIM card for this phone, please?

1392
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:27,119
Not for that model, but we can sort one out
for you if you want to come with me.

1393
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,519
Can you make this work.
I need it. Is it on?

1394
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,999
It's only a display model.
Do you want that one?

1395
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,199
Yeah, I want it. I need it.

1396
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,679
Gordon? Can you get that phone
for me, please, mate?

1397
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,319
Waj, why are you doing this?

1398
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,159
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

1399
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:47,839
Sorry?

1400
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:51,519
Rubber Dinghy Rapids, bro.
Fast track.

1401
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,799
Straight on the rides, like Alton Towers.

1402
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,519
- No queue.
- You like funfairs then, Waj?

1403
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,079
It's not a funfair, bro,
it's a theme park.

1404
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,039
Funfair? How old are you?

1405
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,079
Alton Towers got a spa, bro.

1406
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,919
- Just now.
- All right, mate.

1407
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,119
I'm doing it for you.
Would you like 12 months?

1408
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,279
- Contract?
- Any.

1409
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,159
- Do the call plan.
- All right, mate.

1410
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,479
Easy, bro, easy.
I'm doing it for you.

1411
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,359
- I think I'm going to go now, bro.
- Wait, Waj. What about girls?

1412
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,079
I bet you like the ladies.

1413
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,239
Is this your first time, bro?

1414
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,319
Are you a virgin at this?

1415
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,839
Please, Waj,
can we talk about girls?

1416
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,279
You fill that out. Fill it out.

1417
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,559
- What sort of call plan would you like?
- What?

1418
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,759
We've got the Labrador?
The Dragon?

1419
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,119
- Just any?
- How about the Hermit Crab?

1420
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,599
- Huh?
- It's 1800 free texts.

1421
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,799
Forget it.

1422
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,479
I've still got your card.

1423
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,439
OK, we can talk about girls.

1424
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,719
Right so what sort of girls
are you into, then, Waj?

1425
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,359
I don't know.
Ones with big jubblies and that.

1426
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,279
- Yeah? You like them big, Waj?
- Yeah.

1427
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,759
And nice fit arses, too, man.

1428
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,159
You're an arse man, aren't you, Waj?

1429
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,639
I knew you were, bro.
You're an arse man.

1430
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,679
You're a massive arse man.

1431
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,799
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you're an arse man, Waj.

1432
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,159
You giving me batty chirps, bro?
You calling me a whammer?

1433
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,799
- No.
- Fuck off!

1434
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,319
Fucking Boy George!

1435
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,999
Don't worry, brother Nabil.

1436
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,239
Hold on to these.

1437
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,719
When I press the clicker,

1438
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,159
just think about taking out the kuffar.

1439
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,079
You'll be in paradise before me, bro!

1440
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,639
But there's no kuffar here, bro.

1441
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,999
Yeah, but...

1442
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,759
Brother Faisal, he's a martyr
and he only blew up a sheep.

1443
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,439
I think you might be confused, brother.

1444
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,359
I'm not.

1445
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,399
You look confused.

1446
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,559
Sorry. Matt!

1447
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,479
- Omar!
- Matt!

1448
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,879
Yeah, man, listen.
Have you got a signal on your phone?

1449
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,479
Yeah. What are you doing here?

1450
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,719
I'll level with you Matt. I'm Ml5.

1451
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,359
Special undercover job. I'm a spook.

1452
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,879
What?

1453
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,719
So what's going on?

1454
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,319
Fathers 4 Justice.

1455
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,799
They've teamed up with the Real IRA.
It's the nightmare scenario.

1456
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,559
- Jesus.
- Yeah. Just give me five.

1457
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,159
Fucking "number unknown" again.

1458
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,599
Is that whammer cop
going straight to hell or what?

1459
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,879
- What are you doing?
- Hello?

1460
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,759
- Hello, Waj, bro. It's Omar.
- Omar?

1461
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,799
Omar?

1462
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,639
- Waj.
- Tell me what to do, bro.

1463
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,559
I think I might be confused
but I'm not sure.

1464
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,359
Listen, bro.
You do what I do, right?

1465
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,839
You do the same as me, OK?

1466
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,839
Yes, brother, I'll do the same as you.

1467
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:13,079
Right, OK.
I'm going give myself up, bro.

1468
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,239
- Eh?
- I'm going to give myself up, bro.

1469
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,839
Waj? Waj!

1470
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,639
Waj? Waj?

1471
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:33,159
Brother, what am I?
What am I doing, brother?

1472
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,959
- Waj! Waj!
- What am I doing, brother?

1473
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,759
- Pick up the phone!
- Bro, what am I doing?

1474
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,439
All right, mate?

1475
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,439
I'm sorry, lads.
I don't really know what I'm doing.

1476
01:27:54,360 --> 01:28:00,159
What was that?

1477
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,359
Are you all right?

1478
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,999
Omar, are you all right?

1479
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:19,279
Now, you stay here.
And you tell them I were smiling.

1480
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,839
What?

1481
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,039
Smile on my face.
Could be important.

1482
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,759
Right... Smile.

1483
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,959
- Is there?
- Yeah.

1484
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,159
Where are you going?

1485
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,639
Omar?

1486
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:28,719
This is RAF Mildenhall,

1487
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,999
but it's actually Egypt.

1488
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:35,319
When you entered the base,
you left Britain,

1489
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:40,279
and you passed through US jurisdiction
and into this container,

1490
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,999
which is internationally recognised
as the sovereign territory of Egypt.

1491
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,399
You are now in Egypt.

1492
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,999
There are some pretty hellish Egyptians
behind that door there.

1493
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,679
They use electrodes. They use drills.

1494
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,599
Biro refills.
Do you know what I mean?

1495
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,359
I don't know anything about my brother.

1496
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,399
We know a lot more
than you think we do.

1497
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,959
All right, let's get one thing straight.
Omar Khan had nothing to do with this.

1498
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,839
Cos I knew him and I worked with him.

1499
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,559
Did you know
he was actually working for Ml5?

1500
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,399
Cos he told me that himself.

1501
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:32,279
The report makes crystal clear
that the police shot the right man,

1502
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:35,719
but, as far as I'm aware,
the wrong man exploded.

1503
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,919
Is that clear?

1504
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,919
Today you felt our exploding sword

1505
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,519
in your fat oppressor stomachs, man.

1506
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:53,879
We're the muslimeen
and we're making terrible scenes

1507
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,599
Now you wanna know
what the boom-boom means?

1508
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,239
It's like Tupac said:
"When I die, I ain't dead

1509
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,999
"Fight and be slain,
die with no pain

1510
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:08,439
Got shaheed in my heed,
for my creed I daheed

1511
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,919
We are the martyrs,
you'sjust smashed tomatoes

1512
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:15,079
- Now we've got...
- Bro? What were that?

1513
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,319
For my creed, I daheed

1514
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,839
What's "daheed", though?

1515
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,199
Died.

1516
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,479
- Daheed, died. Daheed.
- That's bollocks, man.

1517
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,039
- You're rhyming doolally.
- That's clear, man.

1518
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,479
No, no, look. In my opinion...

1519
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:29,879
Look, no, man. In your opinion?
Your opinion's shit, man.

1520
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,239
With all due respect, bro,
you like Maroon 5.

1521
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,799
What the fuck's that about?

1522
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,199
- Come here.
- Whoa, whoa!

1523
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,159
- Come here, man.
- I'm joking!

1524
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:59,559
When we talk about a so-called
terrorist attack on the London marathon,

1525
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,679
we should remember one thing:

1526
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,919
Most loud bangs are not bombs,

1527
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,039
they're scooters backfiring.

1528
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,679
This footage, taken from an American spy plane.

1529
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,359
Appears to show two trainee Mujahideens
struggling with a rocket launcher.

1530
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,159
Firing it at an Arab training camp

1531
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,919
and accidentally blowing up Osama bin Laden.

1532
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:41,599
The western imperialist culture
has left you like materialist junkies,

1533
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:45,919
mainlining iPods and Humvees
and TK Maxx into a spiritual void.

1534
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,279
Is Mad Qadeer watching this?

1535
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:52,919
- What?
- Mad Qadeer, cos he owes me £200.

1536
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,319
Mad Qadeer, if you're watching, right,

1537
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,519
you owe me £200.

1538
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,359
And you're gonna pay up.

1539
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,239
Cos I'm not here right now.

1540
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,999
I'm somewhere else,
but you're still gonna pay.

1541
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,839
You're going to pay Saf.
Saf, if you're watching, bro,

1542
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,199
you go round Mad Qadeer's house, right,

1543
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,119
and you get him to pay me my £200,
cos he's owed it me a long time.

1544
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,759
He owes me money.
