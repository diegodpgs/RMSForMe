1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,040
25.000

2
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,640
I sure do love you.

3
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,720
Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.

4
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,120
-How are you today?
-Fine, thank you.

5
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,920
It's okay, I've got it. Thanks.

6
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,120
-Good morning, Madam.
-Good morning, Karl.

7
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic.
You'd better get some traps.

8
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,360
Rats?

9
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,280
I'm afraid so.

10
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,120
But the attic is clean.

11
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
All right, then, we've got clean rats.

12
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,760
-No rats.
-I just heard them, Karl.

13
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,600
Maybe prowlers.

14
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,760
Yeah, or maybe rats.
Now, will you just get the traps?

15
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,040
Yes, I go now.

16
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,840
-Don't go now. The stores aren't open yet.
-I'll go see.

17
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,880
They're closed!

18
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,640
In the group over here,
I need a couple ofpriests, a nun....

19
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,280
That's exactly what we want.

20
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,560
Is this scene really essential? Would you
just consider if we can do without it?

21
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,240
Look at this damn thing.
It just doesn't make sense.

22
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,480
It's plain. You're a teacher of the college.
You don't want the building torn down.

23
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,360
-I can read, for Christ's sake!
-Well, what's wrong?

24
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,720
Well, why are they tearing
the building down?

25
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,640
Shall we summon the writer?
He's in Paris, I believe.

26
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,520
Hiding?

27
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,360
Fucking.

28
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
Scene 39: Hotel. Take four.

29
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,840
All right. Hustle back on in.

30
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,200
Is this your campus?

31
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,040
Let's get the Defense Department
off this campus!

32
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,920
It's our school!

33
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,760
They have no right!

34
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,880
I've seen enough killing in my life!

35
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,320
There's no reason for it anymore!

36
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,720
Wait a minute!

37
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,480
We're all concerned with human rights,
for God's sake...

38
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,960
...but the kids who want
to get an education have a right, too!

39
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,960
Don't you understand? It's against
your own principle, for God's sake!

40
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,760
You can't accomplish anything
by shutting kids off from their....

41
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,280
If you want to effect any change,
you have to do it within the system.

42
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,320
Okay, cut! That's a wrap.

43
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,800
I think I'll walk home tonight, Mike.
Here, take that and drop it by my house.

44
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,600
Good night, Tom.

45
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,680
There's not a day in my life
that I don't feel like a fraud.

46
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,720
I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers.
I've talked to them all.

47
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,120
I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.

48
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,800
Hello?

49
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
In here.

50
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,360
-Hi. How did your day go?
-Not too bad.

51
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,560
It was like the Walt Disney version
of the Ho Chi Minh story.

52
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,960
Other than that, it was terrific.
What have we got, anything exciting?

53
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,000
Also, you got an invitation.

54
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,360
What's this?

55
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,760
Dinner at the White House.

56
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,200
You're kidding me!
What, a big party or something?

57
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,880
I think it's five or six people.

58
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,200
Thursday? All right.

59
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,480
Hi, Mom.

60
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,920
What did you do today?

61
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
-Stuff.
-What does ''stuff'' mean?

62
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,520
Me and Sharon played a game
in the backyard.

63
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,760
And we had a picnic down by the river.

64
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
Mom, you should have seen it!

65
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,760
This man came along
on this beautiful gray horse.

66
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,280
Really? What kind?

67
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,800
Was it a mare, a gelding?

68
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,120
I think it was a gelding.

69
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,560
It was gray.

70
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,600
It was so beautiful.

71
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,040
The guy let me ride it
all around and everything.

72
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,040
She rode it for about half an hour.

73
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,560
I loved it! Mom, can't we get a horse?

74
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,560
-Not while we're in Washington, honey.
-Why not, Mom?

75
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,720
We'll see when we get home, okay?

76
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,600
-When could I have one?
-We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

77
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,560
On the party invitations,
I want to write a personal--

78
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,040
Regan, don't! Come back!

79
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,280
-All right, give it up. Give it up!
-No!

80
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,760
You'll be sorry!

81
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,800
Father?

82
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,560
Could you help an old altar boy?

83
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,760
I'm a Catholic.

84
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,880
Mama?

85
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
-I'm so glad to see you.
-You look good.

86
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm all right.

87
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,960
-How's your leg?
-How about you? You are all right?

88
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,040
I'm fine, Mama.

89
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,120
Your Uncle John...

90
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,160
...passed by to visit me.

91
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,200
Really? When?

92
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,440
Last month.

93
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,520
-Is that too tight?
-No.

94
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,800
You have to stay off it. You can't go
up and down the stairs. Give it a rest.

95
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,360
Okay.

96
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,760
I could take you somewhere where
you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.

97
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,160
There would be people around.

98
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,680
You wouldn't be sitting here
listening to the radio.

99
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,400
You understand me?

100
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
This is my house
and I'm not going no place.

101
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,760
Dimmie, you worry for something?

102
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,600
-No, Mama.
-You are not happy?

103
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,360
Tell me, what is the matter?

104
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,920
Mama, I'm all right. I'm fine. Really, I am.

105
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,640
Here it comes.

106
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,240
There!

107
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,680
-Look at that!
-Do you like it?

108
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,480
Isn't that funny?

109
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,840
I better put him over here to dry, though.
He's still wet.

110
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,680
Hey, where did this come from?

111
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,160
-I found it.
-Where?

112
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,320
In the closet.

113
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,760
Have you been playing with it?

114
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,480
-Yep.
-Do you know how?

115
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,120
I'll show you.

116
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,960
Wait a minute. You need two.

117
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,000
No, you don't. I do it all the time.

118
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,920
Well, let's both play.

119
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
You really don't want me to play?

120
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,640
No, I do! Captain Howdy said no.

121
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,320
-Captain who?
-Captain Howdy.

122
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,560
Who's Captain Howdy?

123
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,640
You know. I make the questions
and he does the answers.

124
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,920
-Captain Howdy. I see.
-He's nice.

125
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
I'll bet he is.

126
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,680
Here, I'll show you.

127
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,200
Captain Howdy,
do you think my Mom is pretty?

128
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,440
Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice.

129
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,560
-Maybe he's sleeping.
-You think?

130
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,040
Why are you reading that stuff?.

131
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,480
Because I like it.

132
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,520
It's not even a good picture of you.

133
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,040
-You look so mature.
-I wouldn't talk!

134
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
You wouldn't talk?

135
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,120
I didn't have my makeup man there.

136
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,720
Let me take an eyelash off your face.

137
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,800
No, I didn't get it.

138
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,200
What are we going to do on your birthday?
lsn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?

139
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
No work? What can we do?

140
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
I don't know.

141
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,320
What would you like to do? Got any ideas?

142
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,480
Let me think....

143
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,720
You know, we never finished seeing
all the sights in Washington.

144
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,080
We didn't get to the Lee Mansion,
lots of stuff.

145
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,040
Shall we do that? Go sightseeing?

146
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,120
-If it's a nice day?
-Yeah, let's do that.

147
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,160
And tomorrow night,
I'll take you to a movie.

148
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,520
I love you!

149
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,720
I love you, Rags.

150
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,080
We'll have a good day.

151
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,680
You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like.

152
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,000
Mr. Dennings?

153
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,560
Well, you know, it's okay.

154
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,480
Thank you very much...

155
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,320
...but why would I want to bring Burke
on your birthday?

156
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,560
Well, you like him.

157
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,760
Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him?
What's going on? What is this?

158
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,960
You're going to marry him, aren't you?

159
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,280
You've got to be kidding!
Me marry Burke Dennings?

160
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,640
Don't be silly. Of course not.

161
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,720
Where did you ever get an idea like that?

162
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,160
But you like him.

163
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,440
Of course, I like him. I like pizzas too,
but I'm not going to marry one.

164
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,160
You don't like him like Daddy?

165
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,640
Regan, I love your Daddy.

166
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,200
I'll always love your Daddy, honey.

167
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,680
Burke just comes around here a lot
because...

168
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,760
...well, he's lonely.
He don't got nothing to do!

169
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,400
Well, I heard differently.

170
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,880
Oh, you did? What did you hear?

171
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,840
I don't know. I just thought.

172
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,480
Well, you didn't think so good.

173
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,120
How do you know?

174
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,760
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Okay? Really.

175
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,680
Are you ready for sleep?

176
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,880
Good night, honey.

177
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,040
It's my mother, Tom.

178
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,520
She's alone and I never
should have left her.

179
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,840
At least in New York, I'd been near.
I'd been close to her.

180
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,040
I could see about a transfer, Damien.

181
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,320
I need reassignment, Tom. I want out
of this job. It's wrong, it's no good.

182
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,320
You're the best we've got.

183
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,120
Am I really?

184
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,160
It's more than psychiatry,
and you know that, Tom.

185
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,680
Some of their problems
come down to their faith...

186
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,440
...their vocation, the meaning of their lives,
and I can't cut it any more.

187
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,000
I need out. I'm unfit.

188
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,360
I think I've lost my faith, Tom.

189
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,880
Hello?

190
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,720
Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.

191
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,680
Operator, you have got to be kidding!

192
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,280
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!

193
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,080
Jesus Christ! Can you believe this?

194
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,000
He doesn't even call his daughter
on her birthday!

195
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,320
Oh, circuits, my ass!
He doesn't give a shit!

196
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,600
-Why don't you let me--
-No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right.

197
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,040
Operator, don't tell me there's no answer.
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome!

198
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,520
Would you try it again, please,
and let it ring?

199
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,400
Hello? Yes.

200
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,840
No, Operator,
I've given you the number four times!

201
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,840
What do you do, take an illiteracy test
to get that job, for Christ's sake?

202
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,200
Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!

203
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah?

204
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,400
You're kidding me!

205
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,640
I thought I just went to bed.

206
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,000
What are we doing, Scene 61?

207
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,240
Just remind Phil about that blue belt.

208
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,640
What are you doing here?

209
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,320
My bed was shaking.

210
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,200
I can't get to sleep.

211
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,480
Goddamn it!

212
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,120
Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that!

213
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,280
I'm very sorry, but you see? No rats.

214
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,760
No rats. Thanks a lot. That's terrific.

215
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,920
Oh, my God!

216
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,280
Unroll your fist.

217
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,280
Arm up.

218
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,000
Very good. That wasn't so bad, was it?

219
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,400
Remain perfectly still. Breathe normally.

220
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,360
Tell me if you feel a vibration.

221
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,600
Regan?

222
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,560
You feel anything?

223
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,000
Can you feel this?

224
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,280
I don't feel anything.

225
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,800
Put this in your mouth.

226
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,280
Keep it there.

227
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,200
This tells your temperature.
When the red light goes on...

228
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,000
...that's your temperature.

229
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,240
I don't want it.

230
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,320
A disorder of the nerves...

231
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,120
...at least we think it is.

232
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,120
We don't know yet exactly how it works.

233
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,520
It's often seen in early adolescence.

234
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,080
She shows all the symptoms.

235
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,680
Hyperactivity.

236
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,160
Her temper.

237
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,120
Performance in math.

238
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,200
Why the math? What is that?

239
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,440
It affects her concentration.

240
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,800
Now this is for Ritalin.

241
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,000
10 milligrams a day.

242
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,960
Is that a tranquilizer?

243
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,520
It's a stimulant.

244
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,040
A stimulant? My God,
she's higher than a kite now.

245
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,680
Her condition isn't quite what it seems.

246
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,800
Nobody knows the cause
of hyperkinetic behavior in a child.

247
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,360
The Ritalin seems to work
to relieve the condition.

248
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,480
And as to how or why,
we really don't know.

249
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,040
But her symptoms could be overreaction
to depression.

250
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,600
That's out of my field.

251
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,960
My daughter isn't depressed.

252
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,240
You mentioned her father
and the separation....

253
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,120
Do you think I should take her
to a psychiatrist?

254
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,520
No. I think we should wait
and see what happens with the Ritalin.

255
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,080
I think that's the answer.

256
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,600
Let's wait two, three weeks.

257
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,800
All right. And the lies she's been telling?
That's part of it?

258
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,000
-Lies?
-Like saying her bed's shaking.

259
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,880
Have you ever known
your daughter to swear?

260
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,720
-To use obscenities?
-No, never.

261
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,040
Interesting.

262
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,320
Similar to things like her lying...

263
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,200
-...it's uncharacteristic.
-I don't understand. She doesn't swear.

264
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,920
She let loose quite a string
while I was examining her.

265
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,160
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?

266
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,040
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.

267
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,160
Well, give me an example. Like what?

268
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,000
Specifically, what did she say?

269
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,160
Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil...

270
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,800
...she advised me to keep my fingers
away from her...

271
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,960
...goddamned cunt.

272
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,960
I can't believe it.

273
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,400
You don't think a psychiatrist....

274
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,000
No. I think the best explanation
is always the simplest.

275
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,480
We'll wait. We'll wait and see.

276
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,560
In the meantime...

277
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,720
...try not to worry.

278
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,960
How?

279
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,840
The edema affected her brain,
you understand?

280
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,520
She don't let no doctor come near her.

281
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,200
She was all the time screaming,
even talking to the radio.

282
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,280
You should've called me when it happened.

283
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,080
Regular hospital is not going
to put up with that, Dimmie.

284
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,960
We give her a shot and bring her here...

285
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,000
...until the doctors fix up her leg,
then we take her right out.

286
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,400
Two or three months and she's out,
good as new!

287
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,480
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

288
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,000
-Do you have an appointment?
-Yes.

289
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,640
-Are you a relative?
-I am her brother. He is her son.

290
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,240
Just a minute.

291
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,880
You know, it's funny.

292
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,280
If you weren't a priest, you'd be
a famous psychiatrist now on Park Avenue.

293
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,120
Your mother would be living
in a penthouse instead of there.

294
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,440
You go in, Dimmie.
I'll wait for you outside.

295
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,960
You'll find Mrs. Karras on the last bed
on the left-hand side.

296
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,480
It's Dimmie, Mama.

297
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Why did you do this to me, Dimmie?

298
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,120
Why?

299
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,960
Come on, I'll take you out of here.
Mama, I'm going to take you home.

300
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,640
Mama, everything's going to be all right.
I'm going to take you home.

301
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,200
-Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
-Like what?

302
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,600
Private hospital?
Who's got the money for that?

303
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,280
You?

304
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,080
There seems to be
an alien pubic hair in my drink.

305
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,240
I beg your pardon?

306
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,440
Never seen it before in my life. Have you?

307
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,520
We're pretty comfortable up there...

308
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,000
...compared to the Gemini and Mercury
programs, where they were tight for space.

309
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,200
We've got about 210 cubic feet,
so we can move around.

310
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,880
If you ever go up there again,
will you take me along?

311
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
What for?

312
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,000
First missionary on Mars!

313
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,760
Tell me, was it public relations you did
for the Gestapo or community relations?

314
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm Swiss!

315
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,160
Yes, of course.

316
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,240
And you never went bowling
with Goebbels, either, I suppose.

317
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,120
Nazi bastard!

318
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,920
Over behind the church. You know where
I mean? It's a red brick wing.

319
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,960
What goes on there? I mean,
who's the priest I keep seeing there?

320
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,400
He's there all the time. He has black hair
and he's very intense looking.

321
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,280
-Who's that?
-Damien Karras.

322
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,160
That's his office the back of Saint Mike's.
He's our psychiatric counselor.

323
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,840
He had a pretty rough knock last night,
poor guy. His mother passed away.

324
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,800
She was living by herself, and...

325
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,160
...l guess she was dead a couple of days
before they found her.

326
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,840
Cunting Hun!

327
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,000
Bloody, damned, butchering, Nazi pig!

328
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,160
Stop it! I'll kill you!

329
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,880
What's for dessert?

330
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,720
You sleeping?

331
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,160
Burke, your car's at the curb.
Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm.

332
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,040
Yes, honey. What?

333
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,400
Oh, was he acting up! Why?

334
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,480
Hi, Chris. It's a great party.

335
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,120
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.

336
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,160
I don't need any encouragement. My idea
of Heaven is a solid white nightclub...

337
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,080
...with me as a headliner for all eternity,
and they love me.

338
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,600
''Down on the eastside
of toidy-toid and toid

339
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,080
''That's my home sweet home! ''

340
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,160
I think we've got a guest.

341
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,320
You're going to die up there.

342
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,640
Oh, my God, honey.

343
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,640
Honey, what's the matter?

344
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,200
I'm sorry, she's been sick.
She didn't know what she was saying.

345
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,720
What made you say that, Regan?

346
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,600
Do you know, sweetheart?

347
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,280
Mother?

348
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,640
What's wrong with me?

349
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,320
It's just like the doctor said.
It's nerves, and that's all.

350
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,400
You just take your pills
and you'll be fine. Really.

351
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,120
Okay?

352
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,080
Is it coming out, Willie?

353
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,120
Yes, I think so.

354
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,200
Mother!

355
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,560
Where'd you get the money
for the Chivas Regal, the poor box?

356
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,280
That's an insult. I've got a vow of poverty.

357
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,960
Where'd you get it, then?

358
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,120
I stole it.

359
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,960
I believe you.

360
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,480
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.

361
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,920
I figure I saved him from a big temptation.

362
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,720
Oh, Christ!

363
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,280
I should have been there. I wasn't there.

364
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,200
There was nothing you could do.

365
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,040
Lie down.

366
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,720
Give me the butt. Come on.

367
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
-Now you think you can sleep?
-Yes.

368
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,240
-Are you going to steal my shoes now?
-No.

369
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,800
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
Now, shut up and go to sleep.

370
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,480
Good night.

371
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,120
Stealing is a sin.

372
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,880
I don't want it!

373
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,400
Honey, it's to help you.

374
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,200
I don't want it!

375
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,960
You fucking bastard!

376
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,280
Remember also, O Lord,
Thy servant, Mary Karras...

377
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,240
...who has gone before us...

378
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,320
...with the sign of faith,
and sleeps the sleep of peace.

379
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,560
''Lord, I am not worthy to receive you.

380
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,960
''But only say the Word
and I shall be healed.

381
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,120
''May the body of Christ bring thee
to everlasting life.''

382
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,400
It's a symptom...

383
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,560
...of a type of disturbance in
the chemical-electrical activity of the brain.

384
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,800
In your daughter's case,
in the temporal lobe.

385
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,920
Up here in the lateral part of the brain.

386
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,280
It's rare, but it does cause
bizarre hallucinations...

387
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,440
...and usually just before a convulsion.

388
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,800
A convulsion?

389
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,000
The shaking of the bed.
That's doubtless due to muscular spasms.

390
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,160
No, no, that was no spasm.

391
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,080
I got on the bed.

392
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,800
The whole bed was thumping
and rising off the floor...

393
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,440
...and shaking, the whole thing!
With me on it!

394
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,840
Mrs. MacNeil, the problem
with your daughter is not her bed.

395
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,000
It's her brain.

396
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,520
What causes this?

397
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,720
Lesion in the temporal lobe.

398
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,480
It's a kind of seizure disorder.

399
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,720
Look, Doc, I really don't understand
how her whole personality could change.

400
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,160
In temporal lobe, it's very common.

401
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,160
It is?

402
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,400
It can last for days, even weeks.

403
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,760
It isn't rare to find destructive...

404
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,920
...even criminal behavior.

405
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,600
Hey, do me a favor, will you?
Tell me something good.

406
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,640
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion,
in a way, she's fortunate.

407
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,160
All we have to do is remove the scar.

408
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,640
Regan, can you sit up and scoot over here?

409
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,120
A little more.

410
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,080
Good.

411
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,040
I'm just going to move you down
on the table, okay?

412
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,240
That's just for a short time.

413
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,320
You're doing fine.

414
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,640
Very sticky.

415
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,200
Now, Regan, you're going to feel
something a little cold and wet.

416
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,240
Now you're going to feel a little stick here.
Don't move.

417
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,560
Good.

418
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,600
You're going to feel some pressure here.
Now, don't move.

419
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,160
Hook up!

420
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,280
There's nothing there.

421
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,480
No vascular displacement at all.

422
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,920
Do you want me to run another series?

423
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,400
I don't think so.

424
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,000
I'd like you to see her again.

425
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,280
Excuse me, Doctor.
Chris MacNeil is on the phone.

426
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,600
She says it's urgent.

427
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,640
Have you got some time?

428
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,720
Dr. Klein?

429
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,920
Yes, I'm Dr. Klein. This is Dr. Tanney.

430
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,680
Things have gotten worse since I phoned.
Come upstairs.

431
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,160
-Is she having the spasms again?
-Yes, but they've gotten violent.

432
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,240
Did you give her
the medication I gave you?

433
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,960
-What was that?
-Thorazine.

434
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,520
Before that, it was Ritalin.

435
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,920
Chris, doctors.

436
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,120
Mother, please!

437
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,560
Please, Mother, make him stop!

438
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,920
It's burning! It's burning!

439
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Do something, Doctor. Please, help her!

440
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,160
Make it stop! He's trying to kill me!

441
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,760
Mother!

442
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,040
Keep away!

443
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,640
The sow is mine!

444
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,400
Fuck me!

445
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,760
Fuck me!

446
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,920
Stay away from me!

447
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,920
Hold her tight!

448
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,880
Don't let them, Mother, please!

449
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,480
She's heavily sedated.

450
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,280
She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.

451
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,560
What was going on in there?
How could she fly off the bed like that?

452
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,760
Pathological states can induce
abnormal strength...

453
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,840
...accelerated motor performance.

454
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,040
For example...

455
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,760
...say a 90-pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck...

456
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,160
...runs out and lifts the wheels
a half foot up off the ground.

457
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,920
You've heard the story. Same thing here.

458
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,160
Same principle, I mean.

459
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,600
So what's wrong with her?

460
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,200
We still think that the temporal lobe--

461
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,000
What are you talking about,
for Christ's sake?

462
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,880
Did you see her or not?

463
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,560
She's acting like she's fucking
out of her mind!

464
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,960
Psychotic, like a split personality, or....

465
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,480
There haven't been more than 100
authentic cases...

466
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,280
...of so-called ''split personality,''
Mrs. MacNeil.

467
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,440
Now, I know the temptation
to leap to psychiatry...

468
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,760
...but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

469
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,720
So, what's next?

470
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,800
A pneumoencephalogram,
I would think, to pin down that lesion.

471
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,120
It will involve another spinal.

472
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,280
Oh, Christ!

473
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,760
What we missed in the EEG
and the arteriograms...

474
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,840
...could conceivably turn up there.

475
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,000
At least it would eliminate
certain other possibilities.

476
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,560
Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative.

477
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,240
In other words: normal.

478
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,440
Do you keep any drugs in your house?

479
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,360
No, of course not. Nothing like that.

480
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,160
Are you sure?

481
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,240
Of course, I'm sure.

482
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,520
I'd tell you.

483
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,760
Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

484
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,320
Are you planning to be home soon?

485
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,920
I mean to L.A.

486
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,560
No, l...

487
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,840
...l'm building a new house.

488
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,560
My old one has been sold.

489
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,240
I was going to take Regan to Europe
for a while after she finished school.

490
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,200
Why do you ask?

491
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,800
I think it's time we started
looking for a psychiatrist.

492
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,960
Hello?

493
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,200
What do you mean going off
and leaving Regan by herself?.

494
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,200
Are you crazy? Her window's wide open!

495
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,560
-Didn't he tell you?
-Didn't who tell me?

496
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,320
What's Burke got to do with it?

497
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,720
There wasn't anybody here,
so when I went to get the Thorazine...

498
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,520
...l had him stay with her, and....

499
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,880
-I should have known better.
-I guess you should have!

500
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,160
How were the tests?

501
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,400
We have to start looking for a shrink.

502
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,280
Hi, Chuck. Come on in.

503
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,800
I suppose you heard.

504
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,320
Heard what?

505
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,160
You haven't heard.

506
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,320
Burke is dead.

507
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,320
He must've been drunk. He fell down
from the top of the steps right outside.

508
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,720
By the time he hit 'M' street,
he broke his neck.

509
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,280
Oh, God!

510
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,600
Yeah, I know.

511
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,440
When I touch your forehead,
open your eyes.

512
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,880
Are you comfortable, Regan?

513
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,800
Yes.

514
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,640
How old are you?

515
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,240
Twelve.

516
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,480
Is there someone inside you?

517
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,200
Sometimes.

518
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,920
Who is it?

519
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,000
I don't know.

520
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,600
Is it Captain Howdy?

521
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,480
I don't know.

522
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,760
If I ask him to tell me,
will you let him answer?

523
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,560
No.

524
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,800
Why not?

525
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,840
I'm afraid.

526
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,840
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you.

527
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,720
Do you want him to leave you?

528
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,600
Yes.

529
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,760
I'm speaking to the person
inside of Regan now.

530
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,120
If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized...

531
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,480
...and must answer all my questions.

532
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,400
Come forward...

533
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,880
...and answer me now.

534
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,880
Are you the person inside of Regan?

535
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,120
Who are you?

536
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,360
Father Karras?

537
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,000
Have we met?

538
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,080
No, we haven't met,
but they said I could tell.

539
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,960
That you look like a boxer.

540
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,360
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.

541
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,880
What's this all about?

542
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,440
It's true. You do look like a boxer.

543
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,560
Like John Garfield in Body And Soul.

544
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,520
Exactly. John Garfield.
Do people tell you that, Father?

545
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,080
Do people tell you
you look like Paul Newman?

546
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,120
Always.

547
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,120
You know this director
who was doing the film here...

548
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,880
...Burke Dennings?

549
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,080
I've seen him.

550
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,840
You've seen him.

551
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,320
You're also familiar how last week he died?

552
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,680
Only what I read in the papers.

553
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,920
Father, what do you know
on the subject of witchcraft?

554
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,280
From the witching end, not the hunting.

555
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,920
I once did a paper on it.

556
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,240
Really?

557
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,000
From the psychiatric end.

558
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,360
I know. I read it.

559
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,280
All of this desecration in the church...

560
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,120
...do you think this has anything to do
with witchcraft?

561
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,600
Maybe. Some rituals used
in the Black Mass.

562
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,840
And now, Dennings.
You read how he died?

563
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,680
In a fall.

564
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,480
Let me tell you how. Please, Father...

565
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,240
...confidential.

566
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,280
Burke Dennings, good Father...

567
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,320
...was found at the bottom of those steps
leading to 'M' street...

568
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,880
...with his head turned completely around...

569
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,560
...facing backwards.

570
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,000
That didn't happen in the fall?

571
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,440
It's possible.

572
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,760
-Possible, however--
-Unlikely.

573
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,720
Exactly.

574
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,480
So, on the one hand,
we've got a witchcraft kind of murder...

575
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:25,240
...and on the other hand, a Black Mass-type
desecration in the church.

576
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,360
You think the killer
and the desecrator are the same?

577
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,120
Maybe somebody crazy...

578
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,040
...somebody with a spite
against the church.

579
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,720
Some unconscious rebellion.

580
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,320
A sick priest, is that it?

581
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:43,360
Look, Father, this is hard for you.
Please, I understand...

582
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,360
...but for priests on the campus here,
you're the psychiatrist.

583
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,840
You'd know who was sick at the time,
who wasn't.

584
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,200
I mean, this kind of sickness,
you'd know that.

585
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,120
I don't know anyone
who fits that description.

586
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,560
Doctor's ethics.
If you knew, you wouldn't tell?

587
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,000
No, I probably wouldn't.

588
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,960
Not to bother you with trivia,
but a psychiatrist...

589
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,560
...in sunny California, no less...

590
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,800
...was put in jail for not telling the police
what he knew about a patient.

591
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,160
Is that a threat?

592
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,160
No, I mention it only in passing.

593
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,840
Incidentally, I mention it only in passing...

594
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,840
...l could always tell the judge
it was a matter of confession.

595
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,920
Father, wait a minute!

596
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,960
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.

597
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,640
Well, I get passes
to the best shows in town.

598
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,120
Mrs. ''K,'' you know,
she gets tired, never likes to go.

599
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,880
That's too bad.

600
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,080
I hate to go alone.

601
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,560
I love to talk film...

602
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,280
...discuss, to critique.

603
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:53,160
You want to see a film with me?
I've got passes to the Crest. It's Othello.

604
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,920
Who's in it?

605
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,760
Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona and Othello:
Groucho Marx. Are you happy?

606
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,520
I've seen it.

607
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,000
One last time. Can you think
of some priest who fits the bill?

608
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:06,800
Come on!

609
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,520
No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.

610
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,000
All right.

611
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,560
You know who I think really did it?

612
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,320
Who?

613
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,280
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

614
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,960
I could have you deported, you know that?

615
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,360
I lied.

616
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,640
You look like Sal Mineo.

617
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,960
It looks like a type of disorder
that's rarely ever seen anymore...

618
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,160
...except in primitive cultures.

619
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,960
We call it ''somnambuliform possession. ''

620
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,520
Quite frankly, we really don't know
much about it at all, except that...

621
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,240
...it starts with a conflict or a guilt...

622
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:54,000
...and it leads to the patient's delusions
that his body has been invaded...

623
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,920
...by some alien intelligence:

624
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,080
A spirit, if you will.

625
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,480
Look, I'm telling you again,
and you'd better believe me...

626
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,480
...l am not going to lock her up
in some goddamn asylum!

627
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,600
And I don't care what you call it.
I'm not putting her away!

628
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,640
I'm sorry.

629
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,640
You're sorry? Jesus Christ!

630
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:17,160
88 doctors and all you can tell me,
with all your bullshit is....

631
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,720
Of course, there is one
outside chance for a cure.

632
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,400
I think of it as a shock treatment.

633
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,080
As I said, it's a very outside chance.

634
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,560
Would you just name it, for God's sake?
What is it?

635
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,320
-Do you have any religious beliefs?
-No.

636
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,160
What about your daughter?

637
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,720
No.

638
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,760
Why?

639
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,640
Have you ever heard of exorcism?

640
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,360
Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the...

641
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,200
...Rabbi or the Priest try to drive out
the so-called invading spirit.

642
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,080
It's been discarded these days...

643
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,800
...except by the Catholics, who keep it
in the closet as a sort of embarrassment.

644
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,120
But it has worked...

645
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,600
...in fact, although,
not for the reasons they think.

646
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,320
It's purely force of suggestion.

647
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,760
The victim's belief in possession...

648
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,000
...is what helped cause it,
so in that same way...

649
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,120
...the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear.

650
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,000
You're telling me I should take
my daughter to a witch doctor.

651
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,440
Is that it?

652
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,160
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?

653
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,680
She's going to be well?

654
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,200
Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,
I want you to tell me. Now, did you?

655
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,600
No, not me.

656
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
I didn't.

657
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,880
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?

658
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,720
Of course, I didn't.

659
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,600
I didn't put it.

660
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,280
Excuse me, Madam.

661
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,280
What?

662
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,480
-A man to see you.
-What man?

663
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,120
Might your daughter remember, perhaps...

664
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,000
...if Mr. Dennings was in her room
that night?

665
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,960
Why do you ask?

666
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,360
Might she remember?

667
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,400
No, she was heavily sedated.

668
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,560
It's serious?

669
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,920
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

670
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,560
May I ask...?

671
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,840
We still don't know.

672
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,440
Watch out for drafts.

673
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,000
A draft in the fall,
when the house is hot, is...

674
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,520
...a magic carpet for bacteria.

675
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,760
Excuse me, Madam. Anything else?

676
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,760
No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.

677
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,400
It's all right.

678
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,840
Why are you asking all this?

679
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,000
It's strange.

680
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,800
The deceased comes to visit,
stays only 20 minutes...

681
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,120
...and leaves all alone a very sick girl.

682
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,040
And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil...

683
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,360
...it isn't likely he would
fall from a window.

684
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,440
Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck
what we found.

685
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,840
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.

686
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,080
No. My hunch....

687
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,440
My opinion...

688
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,240
...he was killed by a very powerful man:
point one.

689
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,080
And the fracturing of his skull: point two.

690
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,600
Plus the various other things
we mentioned...

691
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,840
...would make it very probable...

692
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,760
...probable, not certain...

693
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,680
...that the deceased was killed and then
pushed from your daughter's window.

694
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,080
But nobody was in the room
except your daughter, so how can this be?

695
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,480
It could be one way.

696
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,640
If someone came calling
between the time Miss Spencer left...

697
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,360
...and the time you returned.

698
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,600
Judas Priest, just a second.

699
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,880
The servants? They have visitors?

700
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,120
Not at all.

701
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,760
You were expecting a package that day,
some delivery?

702
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,120
Not that I know of.

703
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,840
Groceries, cleaning...a package?

704
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,400
I really wouldn't know.
Karl takes care of all that.

705
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,640
I see.

706
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,360
Would you like to ask him?

707
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,200
No, never mind, it's...

708
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,880
...it's very remote.

709
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,120
No, never mind.

710
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,680
Would you like some more coffee?

711
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,320
Please.

712
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,280
That's cute.

713
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,760
Your daughter, she's the artist?

714
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,720
Thank you.

715
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,160
Incidentally...

716
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,040
...you might ask your daughter...

717
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,720
...if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings
in her room that night.

718
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,040
Look, he wouldn't have any reason
in the world to go up to her room.

719
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,440
I know, I realize, but...

720
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,880
...if certain British doctors had
never asked, ''What is this fungus?''...

721
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,240
...we wouldn't today have penicillin.
Correct?

722
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,280
When she's better, I'll ask her.

723
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,640
It couldn't hurt.

724
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,960
In the meantime....

725
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,200
That's okay.

726
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,200
I really hate to ask you this, but...

727
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,960
...for my daughter,
could you please give an autograph?

728
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,120
Of course. Where's a pencil?

729
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,640
Right here.

730
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,480
She'd love it!

731
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,440
What's her name?

732
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,120
I lied. It's for me.

733
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,920
The spelling is on the back: Kinderman.

734
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,880
You know that film you made, ''Angel''?

735
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,880
I saw that six times!

736
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,880
Really?

737
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,120
It was beautiful.

738
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,440
Thank you.

739
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,480
You're a very nice lady.

740
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,720
-Thank you.
-You're a nice man.

741
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,560
I'll come back when she's feeling better.

742
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,160
-'Bye.
-'Bye.

743
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,880
Please, no!

744
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,000
-Do it!
-Please, don't!

745
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,200
You bitch! Do it!

746
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,120
Please, no!

747
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,320
Let Jesus fuck you!

748
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,280
Let Jesus fuck you!

749
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,240
Give it! Give it to me!

750
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,280
Lick me! Lick me!

751
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,880
Mrs. MacNeil, open the door!

752
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,480
Do you know what she did,
your cunting daughter?

753
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,840
Chris MacNeil?

754
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,520
Please go away.

755
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,760
I'm Father Karras.

756
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,800
I'm very sorry. Hello.

757
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,800
I should have told you
I wouldn't be in uniform.

758
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,480
Yeah, that would have helped.

759
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,280
Have you got a cigarette, Father?

760
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,000
Thanks.

761
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,760
Cold.

762
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,520
How did a shrink ever get to be a priest?

763
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,840
It's the other way around. The Society
sent me through medical school.

764
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,120
Where?

765
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,680
Harvard, Bellevue...

766
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,440
...Johns Hopkins. Places like that.

767
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,720
-You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?
-Yes, I am.

768
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,640
-Pretty close?
-Pretty close.

769
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,120
Did he talk to you about my party?

770
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,240
He sure did.

771
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,720
About my daughter?

772
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,480
No, I didn't know you had one.

773
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,400
-He didn't mention her?
-No.

774
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,240
He didn't tell you what she did?

775
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,160
He didn't mention her.

776
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,360
Priests are pretty tight-mouthed then?

777
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,560
That depends.

778
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,560
-On what?
-The priest.

779
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,920
I mean, what if a person...

780
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,840
...came to you, you know, that was
a murderer or a criminal of some kind...

781
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,560
...and they wanted some kind of help?

782
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,480
Would you have to turn them in?

783
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,240
Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice,
I'd say no.

784
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,120
-You wouldn't?
-No, I wouldn't.

785
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,920
But I would try to convince him
to turn himself in.

786
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,440
And, how do you go about
getting an exorcism?

787
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,120
I beg your pardon?

788
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,120
If a person's, you know,
possessed by a demon, or something...

789
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,240
...how do they get an exorcism?

790
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,120
First, I'd have to get them
into a time machine...

791
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,160
...and get them back to the 16th century.

792
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,400
I didn't get you.

793
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,160
It just doesn't happen any more,
Mrs. MacNeil.

794
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,640
Oh, yes? Since when?

795
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,520
Since we learned about mental illness,
paranoia, schizophrenia.

796
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,920
All those things they taught me at Harvard.

797
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,640
Mrs. MacNeil,
since the day I joined the Jesuits...

798
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,360
...l've never met one priest
who has performed an exorcism. Not one.

799
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,800
Yeah, well...

800
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,040
...it just so happens
that somebody very close to me...

801
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,760
...is probably possessed.

802
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,920
And needs an exorcism.

803
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,600
Father Karras, it's my little girl.

804
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,040
Then that's all the more reason
to forget about exorcism.

805
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,480
Why? I don't understand.

806
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,640
To begin with, it could make things worse.

807
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,440
How?

808
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,720
Secondly, the Church,
before it approves an exorcism...

809
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,080
...conducts an investigation
to see if it's warranted.

810
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,680
That takes time.

811
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,080
-You could do it yourself.
-No, I couldn't.

812
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,640
I'd need Church approval,
and that's rarely given.

813
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,920
Could you see her?

814
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,320
Yes, I could.
I could see her as a psychiatrist--

815
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,560
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest!

816
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:10,440
She's already seen
every fucking psychiatrist in the world...

817
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:13,360
...and they sent me to you!
Are you gonna send me back to them?

818
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,720
Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?

819
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,040
You don't understand--

820
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,200
Can't you help her? Just help her!

821
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,320
It wants no straps.

822
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,960
Hello, Regan.

823
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,920
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.

824
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,840
You might loosen these straps then.

825
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,280
I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan.

826
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,200
I'm not Regan.

827
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:23,720
I see.

828
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,440
Well, then, let's introduce ourselves.
I'm Damien Karras.

829
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,040
And I am the devil.

830
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,080
Now kindly undo these straps.

831
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,400
If you're the devil,
why not make the straps disappear?

832
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,360
That's much too vulgar
a display of power, Karras.

833
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,040
Where's Regan?

834
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,120
In here, with us.

835
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,640
Show me Regan
and I'll loosen one of the straps.

836
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,760
Could you help an old altar boy, Father?

837
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,880
Your mother is in here with us, Karras.
Would you like to leave a message?

838
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,160
I'll see that she gets it.

839
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,160
If that's true...

840
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,160
...then you must know
my mother's maiden name.

841
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,320
What is it?

842
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,120
What is it?

843
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,640
Thank you.

844
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:25,000
Look, I'm only against the possibility
of doing her more harm than good.

845
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,640
Nothing you could do
could make it any worse.

846
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,880
I can't do it.

847
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,280
I need evidence that the Church
would accept as signs of possession.

848
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,240
Like what?

849
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,640
Like her speaking in a language
she's never known or studied.

850
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:39,800
What else?

851
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,680
I don't know. I'd have to look it up.

852
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,560
I thought you were supposed
to be an expert.

853
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,280
There are no experts.

854
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,040
You probably know as much
about possession as most priests.

855
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,360
Look, your daughter doesn't say
she's a demon.

856
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,160
She says she's the devil himself.

857
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,640
If you've seen as many psychotics
as I have, you'd realize...

858
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,600
...that's the same as saying
you're Napoleon Bonaparte.

859
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,400
You asked me what I think
is best for your daughter.

860
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,760
Six months under observation...

861
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,280
...in the best hospital you can find.

862
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,600
You show me Regan's double...

863
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:24,440
...same face, same voice, everything...

864
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,120
...and I'd know it wasn't Regan.

865
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,440
I'd know in my gut.

866
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,960
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs
isn't my daughter.

867
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,680
I want you to tell me
that you know for a fact...

868
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,760
...that there's nothing wrong
with my daughter except in her mind!

869
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,920
Tell me you know for a fact
that an exorcism wouldn't do any good!

870
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,320
You tell me that!

871
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,840
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?

872
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,760
No.

873
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,720
Did you know my mother died recently?

874
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,080
Yes, I did. I'm very sorry.

875
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,160
Is Regan aware of it?

876
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,760
Not at all.

877
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,280
Why do you ask?

878
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,120
It's not important. Good night.

879
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,120
Hello, Daddy?

880
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,840
This is me.

881
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,360
-What should I say anyway?
-Just talk to your daddy.

882
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:05,360
Tell him what you've been doing
and how you're feeling.

883
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,520
I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?

884
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,480
He's not going to answer you.

885
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,600
Talk to your daddy, honey.

886
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,640
I don't know what to say.

887
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,040
Well, let's see. First we.... No....

888
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:30,080
Wait. I don't know.

889
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,880
-Tell him about Washington.
-Okay.

890
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,640
You see, we're in Washington now,
Daddy, and....

891
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,920
''He broke the bread,
and gave it to his disciples and said:

892
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,320
'''Take this, all of you, and eat it.

893
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,800
'''For this is my body.'

894
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,520
''When the supper was ended,
he took the cup.

895
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,400
''Again he gave you thanks and praise.

896
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,560
''He gave the cup to his disciples and said:
'Take this...

897
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,160
'''...all of you, and drink from it.

898
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,520
'''This is the cup of my blood.

899
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,280
'''The blood of the new and everlasting
covenant, the mystery of faith.'''

900
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,040
What an excellent day for an exorcism.

901
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,480
You'd like that?

902
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,920
Intensely.

903
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,320
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?

904
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,320
It would bring us together.

905
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,240
You and Regan?

906
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,760
You and us.

907
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,000
Did you do that?

908
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,360
Do it again.

909
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,440
In time.

910
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,480
No, now.

911
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,240
In time.

912
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,360
Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?

913
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:11,520
You speak Latin?

914
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,240
Ego te absolvo.

915
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,640
Quod nomen mihi est?

916
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,480
Bonjour!

917
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,920
Quod nomen mihi est?

918
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,640
La plume de ma tante.

919
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,480
How long are you planning
to stay in Regan?

920
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,280
Until she rots
and lies stinking in the earth.

921
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,160
What's that?

922
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,000
Holy water.

923
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,200
You keep it away!

924
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,520
It burns!

925
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,560
Oh, it burns!

926
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:06,960
Who are you?

927
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,320
You know, I'm like in seclusion.

928
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,440
No, I'm just exhausted from work.

929
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,880
She's, she's all right.

930
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,600
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

931
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:49,000
Okay, I'll talk to you.
I'll call as soon as it's over, all right?

932
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:54,240
No, I just, I'm going through something
and I just have to....

933
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,120
No, no....

934
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,960
There's nothing.

935
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,880
Hey, thanks a lot.

936
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,280
-Want a drink?
-Please.

937
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,720
What do you drink?

938
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,200
Scotch.

939
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,040
Ice and water.

940
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,440
No ice. I'll get some from the kitchen.

941
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,000
That's all right. I'll take it straight.
Please sit.

942
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,840
Where's her father?

943
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,080
In Europe.

944
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,400
-Have you told him what's happening?
-No.

945
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,960
Well, I think you should.

946
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,240
I told Regan that was holy water.

947
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,880
I sprinkled it on her
and she reacted very violently.

948
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,840
It's tap water.

949
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,200
What's the difference?

950
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:19,000
Holy water is blessed. And that doesn't
help support a case for possession.

951
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,760
She killed Burke Dennings.

952
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,520
What?

953
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,680
She killed Burke Dennings.

954
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,360
She pushed him out her window.

955
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:04,000
It's a language, all right. It's English.

956
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,400
What do you mean?

957
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,360
It's English in reverse. Listen.

958
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,720
Give us time.

959
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,760
Let her die.

960
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,240
I am no one. I am no one.

961
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,640
Fear the priest.

962
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,880
Fear the priest.

963
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,880
Merrin!

964
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,960
I am no one.

965
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,000
Merrin!

966
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,320
Merrin!

967
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,680
Yeah?

968
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,000
I'll be right there.

969
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,520
I don't want Chris to see this.

970
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,120
What's wrong? What is it?

971
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:24,080
You're convinced that it's genuine?

972
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,160
I don't know.

973
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,800
No, not really, I suppose.

974
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,160
But I have made...

975
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:36,000
...a prudent judgment that it meets
the conditions set down in the Ritual.

976
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,320
You would want to do
the exorcism yourself?.

977
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,160
Yes.

978
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,360
It might be best to have a man
with experience.

979
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:49,880
Someone who's spent time
in the foreign missions.

980
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,600
I understand, Your Excellency.

981
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,640
Let's see who's around.

982
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:57,160
In the meantime,
I'll call you as soon as I know.

983
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,880
Thank you, Your Excellency.

984
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,880
Well, he does know the background.

985
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:06,000
I doubt there's any danger
in just having him assist.

986
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,840
There should be
a psychiatrist present, anyway.

987
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,000
What about the exorcist?

988
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,520
Have you any ideas?

989
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,280
How about Lankester Merrin?

990
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,560
I had a notion he was in lraq.

991
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,680
I read he was working
on a dig near Nineveh.

992
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,240
You're right, but he's finished.

993
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:26,280
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.

994
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,720
What's he doing there, teaching?

995
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,800
He's working on another book.

996
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:34,440
Don't you think he's too old, Tom?
How's his health?

997
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,360
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.

998
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,760
-Besides, he's had experience.
-I didn't know that.

999
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:46,080
Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa.

1000
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,000
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.

1001
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,680
Father?

1002
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,720
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.

1003
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,080
I'm Father Merrin.

1004
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,320
Come in.

1005
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:05,720
Thank you.

1006
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:09,280
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes. He's here already.

1007
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,280
It's an honor to meet you, Father.

1008
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,120
-Are you very tired?
-No.

1009
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,360
I'd like you to go quickly
across to the Residence...

1010
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,680
...and gather up a cassock for myself...

1011
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:31,120
...two surplices, a purple stole,
and some holy water...

1012
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,520
...and...

1013
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,800
...your copy of The Roman Ritual.
The large one.

1014
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:37,800
I believe we should begin.

1015
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:41,000
Do you want to hear the background
of the case first, Father?

1016
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,040
Why?

1017
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:19,240
Thank you.

1018
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,160
Thank you very much.

1019
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:24,720
You're welcome.

1020
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,880
Would you like some brandy
in that, Father?

1021
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,760
The doctors say I shouldn't.

1022
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,080
But thank God...

1023
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,800
...my will is weak.

1024
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:57,360
Especially important is the warning
to avoid conversations with the demon.

1025
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:03,000
We may ask what is relevant,
but anything beyond that is dangerous.

1026
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,200
He's a liar. The demon is a liar.

1027
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,200
He will lie to confuse us.

1028
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,200
But he will also mix lies with the truth...

1029
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,680
...to attack us.

1030
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,800
The attack is psychological, Damien.

1031
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,240
And powerful.

1032
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,760
So don't listen.

1033
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,280
Remember that. Do not listen!

1034
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,320
It might be helpful
if I gave you some background...

1035
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,000
...on the different personalities
Regan has manifested.

1036
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,320
So far, I'd say there seem to be three.

1037
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,040
-She's convinced that--
-There is only one.

1038
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:02,200
What is your daughter's middle name,
Mrs. MacNeil?

1039
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,240
Teresa.

1040
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,800
What a lovely name.

1041
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:48,760
Stick your cock up her ass,
you mother-fucking worthless cock sucker!

1042
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,000
Be silent!

1043
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,440
''Our Father, who art in Heaven...

1044
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,440
''...hallowed be Thy name.

1045
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,280

Can you give her something?

1155
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:14,680
She'll go into a coma.

Mother.

Did somebody fall?

1177
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:13,400
He fell from the steps here!

-Phonograph.

That's everything.

01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:41,880
I'm going to miss you.

1189
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:43,160
Same here.

1190
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,640
Sure you won't change your mind?

1191
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:02,520
I found this in her room.

1192

You better hurry.

1193

Come on, honey, we have to get going.

1194

-Okay.

-Good-bye, Father.
-Good-bye.

1201
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,120
I'll call you.

1202

'Bye, Father.

-I hope I see you again.
-I hope so, too.

02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,320
Father Dyer?

1205
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:41,120
I thought you'd like to keep this.

1206
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:51,960
Why don't you keep it?

1207
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,240
You just missed them.

1208
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:01,600
How's the girl?

1209
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:03,960
She seemed fine.

1210
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,280
That's important.

1211
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:09,800
That's important.

1212
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:15,320
Back to business, back to work.

1213
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:18,160

-Good-bye.

...do you go to films?

1216
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,640
Sure.

1217
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:33,040
I got passes.

1218
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:35,360
In fact, I got a pass
