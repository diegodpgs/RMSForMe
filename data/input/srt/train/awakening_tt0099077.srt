1
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,610
- Tag. You're it.
- You're it.

2
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,987
- No, I tagged you last.
- Uh-uh.

3
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,366
- Wanna go fishing?
- No fish. They're frozen.

4
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,577
- No, they don't freeze.
- What do they do? Just die?

5
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,790
- No. Hey, look at this car.
- Wow. A beauty.

6
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,751
- Isn't that neat? It's a Ford.
- It's not a Ford.

7
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,545
Yeah, it is. Then what is it?

8
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,464
I don't know, but it's not a Ford.
I've been in one.

9
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,820
Hey, Leonard, what are you doing?
What's it look like?

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,989
Somebody might be coming.

11
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,408
Keep a lookout, James.

12
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,953
- No one's here.
- No one's coming.

13
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,581
- My turn's next.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

14
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,713
What's wrong, Leonard?

15
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,161
Leonard, honey.

16
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,413
- What?
- Better get dressed.

17
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,416
Your breakfast is just about ready.

18
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,588
- Come on. We'll be late.
- Hi, Albert. James.

19
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,548
Hurry up.

20
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,259
- Hi, Mr. Dylan.
- Morning.

21
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,678
They won't let me play with them.

22
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,890
- You always study.
- Of course he does.

23
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,230
- I'm a natural at this stuff.
- Let's see you pass the test.

24
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,069
We're going to begin today
with a history test.

25
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,656
Keep your eyes on your own papers
and at the recess bell

26
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,034
bring your composition books
up to my desk.

27
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,841
So, what are we gonna do today?
I don't know.

28
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,804
Oh, hello, boys.

29
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,390
Hi, Mrs. Lowe.
Can Leonard come and play today?

30
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,351
Oh, no, I'm sorry. Better not today.

31
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,061
Well, how about tomorrow?

32
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,689
I'm afraid he won't be well
by then either.

33
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,568
- When will he be well?
- I don't know.

34
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,492
Thanks for coming by.

35
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,152
Good morning, Bainbridge Hospital,
may I help you?

36
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,113
One moment, please.

37
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,448
Excuse me...
You gotta ask her.

38
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,243
Good morning, Bainbridge Hospital,
may I help you?

39
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,121
Oh, Dr. Horowitz,
can you hold the line?

40
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,164
Bainbridge Hospital,
can I help you?

41
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,292
Yes. Dr. Franklin and Dr. Tyler
are in a board meeting.

42
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,920
Can I take a message,
or would you like...? Bye.

43
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,630
Yes?

44
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,842
Yes, I'm Dr. Malcolm Sayer.
I have an appointment.

45
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,594
Take a seat, please.

46
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,639
Bainbridge Hospital,
may I help you?

47
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,601
Thank you.
Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?

48
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,355
I can connect you to the cafeteria
but they will have to page him.

49
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,525
Thank you.
Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?

50
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,319
Dr. Franklin and Dr. Tyler
are in the boardroom.

51
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,781
I can take messages, or you can
call back in about 45 minutes.

52
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,037
When you say "people,"
you mean living people?

53
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,788
Mm-hm.

54
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,751
Well, I'm here to apply
for a research position

55
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,711
in your neurology lab.

56
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,880
Neurology lab?

57
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,465
We have an x-ray room.

58
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:27,595
This is a chronic hospital, doctor.
The position is for staff neurologist.

59
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,431
You will be working with
patients, people. Yes.

60
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,559
A "doctor" doctor.
Doctor.

61
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,313
Carmel Institute? Tell me about that.
Anything with patients there?

62
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,398
Earthworms.
I'm sorry?

63
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,609
It was an immense project.

64
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,988
I was to extract one decagram
of myelin from 4 tons of earthworms.

65
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,656
Really?
Yes.

66
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,743
I was on that project
for five years.

67
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,830
I was the only one who believed in it.
Everyone said it couldn't be done.

68
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,709
It can't.
I know that now. I proved it.

69
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,171
Maybe before, at St. Thomas?

70
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,716
All research?
Oh, yes.

71
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,011
This isn't going to work.
Ben, we're totally understaffed.

72
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,263
He's never worked
with human beings.

73
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,724
His research talents
would be wasted here.

74
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,811
If it wasn't a state law...
Excuse me. But, uh...

75
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,857
You're clearly looking for someone
with more of a clinical background.

76
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:26,904
As much as I need a job, there must be more
applicants suitable for this position.

77
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,908
Thank you, anyway.
Dr. Sayer, back in medical school.

78
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,620
You couldn't have graduated
without some clinical experience.

79
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,749
You took a pulse, you took
a temperature. You did diagnosis.

80
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,211
Oh.
Well, there you have it then.

81
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,214
You do want the job, don't you?

82
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,263
Hey, it's this way, doc.

83
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,141
You spend much time
at chronic hospitals?

84
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,892
I, um...

85
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,146
You'd remember.
Guess not then.

86
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,441
- Hi.
- Hey, Christina.

87
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,194
You see, doc, we got MS,
Tourette syndrome,

88
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,904
Parkinson's disease.

89
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,074
Some of them,
we ain't even got a name for.

90
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:14,952
How are you?

91
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,871
What are all these people
waiting for?

92
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,080
Nothing.

93
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,916
How do they get well?
They don't, they're chronic.

94
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,085
We call this place the Garden.
Why?

95
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,921
Because all we do
is feed and water them.

96
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,298
Thanks, man.

97
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,927
Mr. Kean, I would like to ask...

98
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,097
I was born in 1911
in Kingsbridge, New York.

99
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,433
I came here in July 1955.

100
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:42,271
Prior to July 1955, I resided
at the Brooklyn Psychiatric Center,

101
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,649
Brooklyn, New York.
Prior to that, I was a person.

102
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,696
No, I'm not gonna hurt you.

103
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,814
Gets easier.

104
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,068
You don't think it will, but it does.

105
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,857
Oh, no, Buttercup. Oh, good.

106
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,735
No, go to your house. Go. Go.

107
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,946
Go home.

108
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,739
Good.

109
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,417
Good morning, doctor.

110
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,670
I have a new arrival for you.

111
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,424
She was brought in late last night.
Here's her file.

112
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,647
Hello. I'm Dr. Sayer.

113
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,944
Do you know where you are?

114
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,575
Can you hear me?

115
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,742
"Diagnosis."

116
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,840
"Medical insurance." Hm.

117
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,010
Oh, God.

118
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,138
Her name is Lucy Fishman.

119
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:12,351
She was found by neighbors with her sister
several days after her sister died.

120
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,436
She has no other
living relatives

121
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,397
and they say she has
always been as she is now,

122
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,234
with no response
or comprehension.

123
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,610
And yet...

124
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,281
A reflex.

125
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,910
If she batted it away,
I might call it a reflex.

126
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,870
But she didn't. She caught it.

127
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,830
It's still a reflex, doctor.

128
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,166
I'm sorry. If you were right,
I would agree with you.

129
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,294
It's as if, having lost
all will of her own to act,

130
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,713
she borrows the will of the ball.

131
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,799
The will of the ball?

132
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,551
Excuse me.

133
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,929
This is ridiculous.

134
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,975
Trying to make
a good impression, right?

135
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,143
A good impression.
That's it, isn't it?

136
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,354
You're still settling in.

137
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,733
Miss Costello, will you see to it that Dr.
Sayer's patients that are waiting outside

138
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,528
are rescheduled for tomorrow.
Yes, sir.

139
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,781
Borrows the will of the ball.

140
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,951
That's great.

141
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,414
Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
Okay.

142
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,292
Let us know
if she catches anything else.

143
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,526
I'll be fired.

144
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,945
It's all right. I'll go back to school.

145
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,741
Did I forget something?
No.

146
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:55,120
I just wanted to say to you
I preferred your explanation

147
00:15:55,538 --> 00:16:00,709
and that I'll look after things
for you until you've settled in.

148
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,712
Good night, doctor.

149
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,881
Thank you.

150
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,134
Thank you very much.

151
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,659
Hello.
Hi.

152
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,661
I'm Dr. Sayer.
I'm Waheedah.

153
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,580
Waheedah. How are you today?
I'm fine, thank you.

154
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:48,674
Yes. Oh, sorry. What form?

155
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,218
Yes, I'll hold.

156
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,886
Mm-hm.

157
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:02,562
Oh. Okay. Three, two.

158
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,315
Oh, thank you.

159
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,942
Bye.

160
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,452
Hello.

161
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,389
- Contact.
- Roger.

162
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,475
Yippee! We made it, Orville.
We're in orbit.

163
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,854
Oh, goody.
Now we can try being weightless.

164
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,526
Let's celebrate
with delicious Nestlé's Quik.

165
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,404
Nothing makes chocolatey milk
like Quik, you know?

166
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,323
That great Nestlé's chocolate flavor
is out of this world.

167
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,617
Out of this world.

168
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:02,372
Hello, up there. Time to recharge
with delicious Nestlé's Quik.

169
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,865
Lucy. Um...

170
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,659
You're out of the hole.

171
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,547
Um, could...?
Anthony.

172
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,924
Anthony.

173
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:58,094
Could you help me move this?

174
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,783
Excuse me.

175
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,260
Lucy, you're almost there.

176
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,886
Come on.

177
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,222
Lucy.

178
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,615
Here's the water, Lucy.

179
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,701
Here it is, Lucy.

180
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,454
The water is...

181
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,964
I don't know why your nails
grow so fast.

182
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,636
It must be all that Jell-O
they give you.

183
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:26,308
Jell-O, Jell-O. Day after day.

184
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:31,062
Red Jell-O, yellow Jell-O.
Every day, Jell-O.

185
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,733
Hurry up. You don't wanna miss
the laundry truck.

186
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,155
I forgot to tell you,
Mrs. Cooper passed away.

187
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,158
Remember her?
She was nice.

188
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,368
Always a kind word.

189
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,662
Her dog I could have
done without.

190
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,497
Excuse me.

191
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,666
Hello.

192
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,795
Does he ever speak to you?

193
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,673
Of course not. Not in words.

194
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,885
He speaks to you in other ways?

195
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,137
How do you mean?

196
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,806
You don't have children.

197
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,433
No.

198
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,020
If you did, you would know.

199
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:22,238
This is "atypical schizophrenia."

200
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,326
"Atypical hysteria," this one.

201
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,206
"Atypical nerve impairment."

202
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,751
"No change since
last examination."

203
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,587
"No change or therapy
recommended."

204
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,756
That's very nice.

205
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:44,719
This one is "no change,"
dated 9-11-44.

206
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,471
Sorry.

207
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,642
That's 25 years.

208
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,853
You'd think, at a certain point,
all these atypical somethings

209
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,730
would amount
to a typical something.

210
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,817
Uh-huh.
But a typical what?

211
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,568
Doctor?
Yes?

212
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,989
Wanna go for a cup of coffee
somewhere or something?

213
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,241
Tea?

214
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,912
Oh, normally, I would say yes.

215
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,247
I made other plans.

216
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,457
Right, right, right.

217
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,085
Well, some other time. All right.
Oh, yes.

218
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,963
I'm over here. Good night.
I'm right there. Night.

219
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,099
"Encephalitis lethargica."

220
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,685
Where is it? Where is it?

221
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,730
"Encephalitis lethargica."

222
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,028
Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.
I thought someone left the lights on.

223
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,238
I found it. I found the connection.

224
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,074
They all survived encephalitis.

225
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,243
Years before they came here.
See? In the 1920s.

226
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,662
That's very nice. Yes.
Isn't it wonderful?

227
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,165
I'll come back later.
Please.

228
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,024
How many have you found there?

229
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,403
Five, and I believe
there are more.

230
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,199
How are they?

231
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:17,205
Just as you described them back
then, "insubstantial as ghosts."

232
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:23,253
Only I guess many of them
were children then.

233
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,050
Yes. Children who fell asleep.

234
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:36,599
Most died during the acute stage
of the illness.

235
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,562
Those who survived, who awoke,

236
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,065
seemed fine,
as though nothing had happened.

237
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,484
We just didn't realize

238
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,654
how much the infection
had damaged the brain.

239
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,910
Years went by, five, 10, 15,

240
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:02,000
before these strange
neurological symptoms would appear.

241
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,085
But they did.

242
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,257
I began to see them
in the early 1930s.

243
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,345
Old people brought in
by their children.

244
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,932
Young people brought in
by their parents.

245
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,644
They could no longer
dress themselves

246
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,022
or feed themselves.

247
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,442
They could no longer speak
in most cases.

248
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,444
Some families went mad.

249
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:34,949
People who were normal
were now...

250
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,661
elsewhere.

251
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,956
What's it like to be them?

252
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,292
What are they thinking?

253
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,629
They're not.

254
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,218
The virus didn't spare
their higher faculties.

255
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:57,055
We know that for a fact?
Yes.

256
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,890
Because?

257
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,685
Because the alternative
is unthinkable.

258
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,567
- He has a crush on you.
- Oh, stop.

259
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,069
- He does.
- No, he doesn't.

260
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,905
- He asked for your number.
- Come on.

261
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,448
He did.

262
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,746
Ow!

263
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,254
I'm all for fixing this place up,
but what are we doing?

264
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,047
I have a hunch.

265
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,925
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry.

266
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,761
What's stopping Lucy
from crossing to the fountain?

267
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,263
Nothing.
Exactly.

268
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,265
The visual field just stops.

269
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,768
There's a void. There's no pattern.
No visual rhythm.

270
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,354
Nothing to compel her
to keep going.

271
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,065
So we're making something.

272
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,275
Exactly.

273
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,820
All right, Lucy.

274
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,589
She's... Yes.

275
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,326
She's looking out the...

276
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,336
Where's that article? Where is it?

277
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,964
This the right issue?

278
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,469
This is last year's. I can't find it.

279
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,392
I'd like to know more about your son.
Certainly.

280
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,650
Something was wrong, they said,
with his hands.

281
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,860
He couldn't write anymore.

282
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,196
He couldn't do the work.

283
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,825
I should take him out of school,
they said.

284
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,326
He was 11.

285
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,871
Slowly, he got worse.

286
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,499
He'd call me and I'd come in.

287
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,836
And he'd be sitting at his desk
in a trance.

288
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,088
One hour, two hours.

289
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,674
Then he'd be okay again.

290
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:25,096
One day I came home from work,
found him in his bed.

291
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:29,267
He kept saying, "Mom. Mom."

292
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,104
His arm like this, reaching.

293
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,399
"What do you want, Leonard?"

294
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,192
He never spoke again.

295
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,861
It was like he disappeared.

296
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:45,616
Later that year,
I took him to Bainbridge.

297
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:53,416
It was November 14th, 1939.

298
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:56,043
He was 20 years old.

299
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,755
What did he do for those nine years
he was in this room, Mrs. Lowe?

300
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,716
He read.

301
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,551
He loved to read.

302
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,052
He read all the time.

303
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,846
Really?

304
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,142
Well, that's all he could do.

305
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,623
That's enough.

306
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,170
Leonard.

307
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,507
All right, Leonard, we're finished.

308
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:51,933
Nothing, nothing, nothing
and nothing.

309
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,436
Don't tell me. It's one of your statues.
Exactly.

310
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,771
How did I guess that?

311
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,731
Pass the salt, will you?

312
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,361
But what about this?

313
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,031
Heh, heh. What do you mean "this"?
It's a strobe.

314
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,325
You're wrong.

315
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:13,329
All of this before is the strobe.
This is me saying his name to him.

316
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,293
Excuse me.

317
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,464
What does that mean?

318
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,977
Hey!
Sorry.

319
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,980
Right down the middle.
Hum it in there. Hum it in there.

320
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,731
Home run. Home run.

321
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,817
I can catch a ball.

322
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,485
Hey, doc, throw me the ball.

323
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,363
Throw me the ball.
Throw me the ball.

324
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,533
Get back.
Hey, I can catch a ball.

325
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,620
- Doc. Hey.
- I said, get back.

326
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,791
- Is this all of them?
- Yes.

327
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,085
Bring them in here with the others.

328
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,356
I should have given David
his divorce.

329
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,735
I just thought he really would want
to be a father to his son.

330
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,820
Excuse me.

331
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,781
The patients have been given
their morning medication.

332
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,742
That's good.

333
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:37,997
Dr. Sayer was hoping you'd have some free time.
Wanna come with me, please.

334
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,043
Beth?
Yeah.

335
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,964
One of the most beautiful arias
ever written.

336
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,925
Watch them closely
for any reactions.

337
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,741
"Call me Ishmael.

338
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,917
Years ago,
never mind how long precisely,

339
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,960
having little or no money

340
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,005
and nothing particular
to interest me on shore..."

341
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,093
Leonard, I know you can hear me.

342
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,097
I want you to try and respond
when I speak your name.

343
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,226
See, it's not just any music.

344
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,562
It has to be the music
that's right for them.

345
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,824
It's like they're only moved
by music that moves them.

346
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,535
I haven't found anything
that moves Bert yet.

347
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,967
They'll sit like that all day
if I let them.

348
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,761
I have to play the first card.

349
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,687
L.

350
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,108
Leonard.

351
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,026
L.

352
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,305
This is Frank.

353
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:02,183
If you could just me help me
get him to his feet.

354
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,685
There's something else
that reaches him.

355
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,146
What?
Human contact.

356
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,940
If you could just stand over there
for a minute.

357
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,944
He can't walk without me.
If I let go of him, he'll fall.

358
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,239
I'm not gonna let you fall.

359
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,325
But...

360
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,411
he'll walk with me anywhere.

361
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,459
It's like the ball,
only it's my will he's borrowing.

362
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,378
The will of another human being.

363
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,221
Just let it glide.

364
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,223
Gentle. Gentle.

365
00:35:55,612 --> 00:36:02,159
I'll begin by moving the pointer to L,
for Leonard.

366
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:07,289
When you begin to move the pointer,
I'll stop and you take over.

367
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,291
Do you understand?

368
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,253
All right. I'm beginning.

369
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,174
Very good.

370
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,560
No, maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

371
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,562
My fault. I, uh...

372
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,734
I.

373
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,118
L. Oh, good, good.

374
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,078
Now the E.

375
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,248
K.

376
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,375
Dyslexia.

377
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,962
E. Good, good.

378
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,965
S.

379
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:01,969
P.

380
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,515
You're spelling something else.

381
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,336
Rilke.

382
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,693
His gaze
From staring through the bars

383
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:04,907
Has grown so weary
That it can take in nothing more

384
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:09,078
For him, it is as though
There were a thousand bars

385
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:13,874
And behind the thousand bars
No world

386
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:19,254
As he paces in cramped circles
Over and over

387
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,299
His powerful strides
Are like a ritual dance

388
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:27,554
Around a center
Where a great will stands paralyzed

389
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:33,227
At times, the curtains of the eye
Lift without a sound

390
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,853
And a shape enters

391
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,190
Slips through the tightened silence
Of the shoulders

392
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,777
Reaches the heart, and dies

393
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,245
Have you heard of
the drug L-dopa?

394
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:54,581
What?
It's a synthetic dopamine.

395
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:59,712
Oh, yes, I did.
For Parkinson's patients, yeah. Why?

396
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,921
Nothing.

397
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:04,299
Sign the petition now.
Thousands of young men

398
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,093
are dying every day.
Sorry.

399
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,596
Help us get out of this illegal war.
Sign up now.

400
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,515
A hundred years would pass

401
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,518
before modern neuropathology
would even allow us

402
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:19,148
to actually locate the damage
in the Parkinsonian brain.

403
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,025
Yes.

404
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,820
With our development
of the drug L-dopa,

405
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,031
we can, for the first time,

406
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:31,035
promise the Parkinsonian patient
a more normal life.

407
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,121
By administering L...

408
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,042
Thank you. Yes, um...

409
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,294
I'm very curious about this drug,

410
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,964
and I wonder if you've come across
anyone who might have...

411
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,508
Excuse me, doctor?

412
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,347
Sayer. I'm curious if you've come
across any patients with encephalitis?

413
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:56,226
After I'm through, Dr. Sayer.
If you wouldn't mind.

414
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,816
- Excuse me.
- As I was saying,

415
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,986
by administering L-dopa...

416
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,494
Do you think a Parkinsonian tremor
taken to its extreme,

417
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,996
would appear as no tremor at all?

418
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,669
You talking to me?
Oh, yes.

419
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,967
Imagine you accelerated
a Parkinsonian hand tremor

420
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,887
to the point of immobility in the...

421
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,264
Suppose there's a patient

422
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,850
with Parkinsonian compulsions
accelerated:

423
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,687
The hand tremor, the head bobbing,
ticking, quickening of speech.

424
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,148
Might they not all cave in
on themselves

425
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,901
and, in effect,
turn a person into stone?

426
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,197
I don't know. Maybe.

427
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,077
Well, do you think L-dopa
would help the situation?

428
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:59,039
Dr. Sayers, right?
Heh, heh.

429
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,001
I'm just a chemist, doctor.
You're the physician.

430
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,838
I'll leave it to you to do the damage.

431
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,974
You know, Freud believed in miracles,
prescribing cocaine like candy.

432
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,809
We all believed in cortisone,

433
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,228
till our patients
went psychotic on it.

434
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,563
And now it's L-dopa?

435
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,607
With all due respect, it's
rather too soon to say that.

436
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,317
Well, with all due respect,

437
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,696
I think it's rather way
too soon to say that.

438
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,991
Let the chemists do the damage,
doctor.

439
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,618
But I...

440
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,756
Dr. Kaufman?
Yeah.

441
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,925
Did you read this case?

442
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,720
"New drug lets shaking
palsy patients eat Jell-O."

443
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:58,182
Yes, I read them, doctor.
I read them all. Dutifully, soberly.

444
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,519
All 30 cases had Parkinson's.
Mild Parkinson's.

445
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,855
Your Parkies,
if that's what they are,

446
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,607
haven't moved in decades.

447
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,026
Look at it again, sir.

448
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,781
Now, you know better
than to make a leap like that.

449
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,036
You want there to be a connection.
That doesn't mean there is one.

450
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:24,166
What I believe, what I know,
is these people are alive inside.

451
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,005
How do you know that, doctor?
Because they catch tennis balls?

452
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,635
I know it.

453
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,305
How many did you think
I'd let you put on it?

454
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,640
All of them.

455
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,811
Some. One.

456
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,693
One. With the family's consent,
signed.

457
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,746
Leonard has Parkinson's disease?

458
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,707
No. Um...

459
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,921
Well, his symptoms
are like Parkinson's,

460
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,423
but then again, they're not.

461
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,844
Then what will this medicine do
for him?

462
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:22,849
I don't know what it will do for him,
if anything at all.

463
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,727
What do you think it'll do?

464
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:31,108
I'm not sure, because it was designed
for a totally different disorder.

465
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,236
What do you hope it'll do?

466
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,116
I hope it'll bring him back
from wherever he is.

467
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,329
To what?

468
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,790
To the world.

469
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,922
What's there here for him
after all these years?

470
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:57,884
You.

471
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,262
You're here.

472
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,969
All of it, please.

473
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,615
At 200 milligrams,
he showed no response.

474
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,867
Maybe the acid
in the juice neutralized it.

475
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,286
Maybe he needs more.
Maybe he needs less.

476
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,042
I'll try it in milk.

477
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,871
Five hundred milligrams.

478
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,420
Mets 2, Giants 2. Bottom half...

479
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,214
I'll call if there's any change.

480
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,341
Yes.

481
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,638
Here's the pitch, on the way.

482
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,890
It's swung on. A high fly ball.

483
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,725
Thank you.

484
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,903
Night, Sara.
Good night.

485
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:05,525
It's quiet.

486
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,863
It's late.

487
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,866
Everyone's asleep.

488
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,749
I'm not asleep.

489
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:25,503
No. You're awake.

490
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,849
May I?

491
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,410
Me.

492
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,520
Leonard.

493
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,152
There's someone here to see you.

494
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,546
Ma. Ma.

495
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:34,841
Mom.

496
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,344
Oh, my baby.

497
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:58,364
My name is Eleanor.

498
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:01,618
Eleanor.

499
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:09,626
It's a pleasure to meet you.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

500
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:18,593
Ladies? Please.
Oh, now what did I do?

501
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,389
Oh, my goodness.

502
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,269
How do you do, sir?

503
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,480
My name is Margaret.

504
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,566
Margaret.

505
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,486
Beth.
Beth.

506
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,493
Anthony.

507
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,749
Anthony, how are you?

508
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:54,087
Great, man. How are you?

509
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,966
Great too.
Ha, ha, ha.

510
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,468
All right, man.

511
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,388
You meet him?
Didn't he look good?

512
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:04,931
Yeah.

513
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,937
- Don't eat so fast.
- He's doing fine.

514
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,690
I mean, he's starving, right?
He was starving.

515
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:17,068
I don't think I could deal with losing
30 years of my life. Could you?

516
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,279
I can't even imagine it.

517
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:23,700
- Potatoes?
- Hey.

518
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:27,412
Come on, try something else.
He does realize it, doesn't he?

519
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,712
Now, Leonard,
turn this way, please.

520
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,131
It's a camera called
a Polaroid.

521
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:39,924
Thank you.

522
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,970
Takes a picture
in less than a minute.

523
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,388
Amazing.

524
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:49,434
Now, if you could try this.

525
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,982
Splendid, that's wonderful.

526
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,444
I'd like you to walk now
to the end of the room.

527
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:02,196
Good. Ready?

528
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,656
Go.

529
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:09,203
Very good.

530
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,500
And back now.

531
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,590
Dr. Sheck to X-ray.
Dr. Sheck to the X-ray.

532
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:24,677
That was very quick, really.
Let me get some more film.

533
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,736
You have to at least lay down.

534
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,780
You need the rest.

535
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,874
I'm afraid to close my eyes.

536
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,919
If I close my eyes, I'll...
You'll sleep.

537
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:45,216
When you wake up in the morning,
it'll be the next morning.

538
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,593
I promise.

539
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:54,303
Happiest day, man.
Far out.

540
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,222
Yes, I...

541
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,225
Look out.
Poison.

542
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,647
What a wonderful place
the Bronx has become.

543
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,166
That's my school.
Really?

544
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:35,261
Is that classical?
You pick any type of music you want.

545
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,186
What's that?
It's rock 'n' roll.

546
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,106
Come on.
No.

547
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:13,758
Come on.
Go get it, boy. Go get it.

548
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:16,844
Attaboy.
Come on, give it back.

549
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,772
Come on in.
No, no.

550
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,984
Come back in. Something happened
while you've been away.

551
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,278
Pollution. I don't think this is wise.

552
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:19,365
Leonard, that's not wading,
that's swimming. Come on, Leonard.

553
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,452
Leonard, I don't know if the
hospital is covered for this.

554
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,746
Leonard.

555
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:29,000
Come on.
No, no. Not...

556
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,085
Come on in.

557
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,510
Leonard, the tide's coming in.

558
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,112
That's the periodic table
of elements.

559
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,240
I can date my introduction
to science by that.

560
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,244
It's wonderful, really. It's...

561
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:07,955
It's the universe at its essence.

562
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,666
You see,
you have your alkaline metals.

563
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,753
You have your halogens,
your inert gases.

564
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,172
Every element has its place
in that order.

565
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,591
You can't change that.

566
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:22,261
They're secure, no matter what.

567
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:23,804
You're not married?

568
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,724
Me?

569
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,976
No.

570
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:32,438
I'm not very good with people.

571
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,273
I, um...

572
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,942
I never have been, Leonard.

573
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,778
I like them.

574
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,825
I wish I could say I had more than a
rudimentary understanding of them.

575
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,581
Maybe if they were
less unpredictable.

576
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,710
Eleanor would disagree with you.

577
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:59,965
Eleanor?
Miss Costello.

578
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,136
Oh, of course.

579
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,306
She's spoken to you about me?

580
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,020
What did she say?

581
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,649
That you are a kind man.

582
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:20,820
That you care very much for people.

583
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:29,286
I'd like to put the rest
of the group on the drug.

584
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,580
I realize this may be
somewhat expensive.

585
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,708
When you say expensive,
you have any idea how much money?

586
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:38,421
Yes, I talked to Ray.
I have an estimate, um...

587
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,674
Thank you. The pharmacist says

588
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:47,596
to put the others on the same dosage
as Mr. Lowe would be, um, 12,000.

589
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,724
How much?
$12,000.

590
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,017
A month?
Yes.

591
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,937
I can't go before the board with that,
doctor.

592
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,524
I was thinking of speaking directly
to the patrons.

593
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:01,902
The few patrons this hospital has
already give what they can.

594
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,281
We'll convince them to give more
than they're accustomed to giving.

595
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:11,454
Perhaps if they see Mr. Lowe.
I think you overestimate the effect

596
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,207
that Mr. Lowe has on people, doctor.
We're talking about money.

597
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,960
There was an extreme rigidity
of the axial musculature.

598
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,922
A gross impairment
of the postural reflexes.

599
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:07,092
An autonomic dysfunction.
It is a brain stem type of rigidity.

600
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,594
A meningismus.

601
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:12,723
What's most striking
is the profound facial masking,

602
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,351
or deafferentation,
which we now know

603
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,562
should not to be confused
with apathy or catatonia.

604
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,530
Some things could reach him,
though.

605
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:33,536
The mention of his name,
notes of a particular piece of music.

606
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,288
Or the touch
of another human being.

607
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,002
But awakenings were rare
and transient,

608
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,879
lasting only a moment or two.

609
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,092
The rest of the time, he remained, as
you see him here, in a metaphorical,

610
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:53,180
if not physiological,
equivalent of sleep, or even death.

611
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:57,351
This was his condition when found by
me in a remote bay of this hospital,

612
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:01,647
and the quality of his life
for the last 30 years.

613
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,324
Now?
SAYER... Whenever you're ready.

614
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:17,663
My name is Leonard Lowe.

615
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:23,627
It has been explained to me that
I have been away for quite some time.

616
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,674
I'm back.

617
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:50,863
Okay, here we go.

618
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,450
Take her away.
Okay.

619
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:56,910
Thank you very much.
Sure.

620
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,537
Thank you.

621
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:12,259
In the United States,
antiwar protesters organized

622
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:15,137
a national moratorium
to demonstrate opposition...

623
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,699
Dr. Sayer.

624
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,577
What is it?
It's a fucking miracle.

625
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,253
Where are my glasses?
On your face.

626
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,463
Oh. Thank you.

627
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,645
I just feel so...

628
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,276
Beth, close the door.

629
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:14,446
I'm talking.

630
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,661
Light.

631
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,623
I'm loose.

632
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,083
I'm scared.

633
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,793
Hello?

634
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,843
- Where is this?
- Don't worry.

635
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,681
I'm walking.

636
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,809
Who are you?

637
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,644
Get up, get up.

638
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,664
Thank you for coming.
Things are different.

639
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,499
- Miriam.
- Miriam.

640
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,168
Miriam.
Good morning.

641
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,170
- Look at that.
- Come on, Miriam.

642
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,046
- Miriam. Miriam.
- I'm so excited.

643
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,299
Come on, Miriam.

644
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:20,596
If you don't eat this food,
I'm gonna be in trouble.

645
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:22,848
Lucy.

646
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,101
I...

647
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,354
I had the strangest dream.

648
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,398
I have to take
your blood pressure.

649
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:34,693
I've been sitting for 25 years,
you missed your chance.

650
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,821
Are you okay?

651
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:40,866
I need some makeup.

652
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,952
Okay. I think we can
take care of that.

653
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,373
And I need some dye for my hair.
Black.

654
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:52,085
Black? Rose, are you sure?

655
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,379
Yes. It's always been black.

656
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,216
Dr. Sayer,
something about fruit trees.

657
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,676
Prune the fruit trees.

658
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,386
I will.

659
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,307
I want a steak, rare. Ah.

660
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,643
Mashed potatoes and gravy.
String beans.

661
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:10,729
I was aware of things,
but nothing meant anything to me.

662
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,774
There was no connection to me.

663
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:15,275
There was a war or two.

664
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:22,407
This morning,
I went to the bathroom all by myself.

665
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,787
Do it, do it, do it.
Heh, heh, heh.

666
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,332
I liked them better the other way.

667
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,586
Protesters marched from a meeting...

668
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:35,838
Where did they go?

669
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,550
Rolando, can you speak to me?

670
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,302
It's Miss Costello.

671
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,849
Do you understand me?

672
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,313
Lucy...

673
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,190
what year is it?

674
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,193
What year is it?

675
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,950
It's '26, silly.

676
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,286
Miriam.

677
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,372
Miriam. Come on, Miriam, be a sport.

678
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,458
- It will only take a second.
- Don't touch.

679
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,793
- Miriam.
- Don't.

680
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,962
Oh, jeez, I'm getting tired of this.

681
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:19,047
Come on, Miriam.

682
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,887
I'm convinced. I really am.

683
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:29,850
"Like crowds storming the Bastille,

684
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:33,729
the mighty Mets stormed
their locker room shortly after 9:00

685
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:36,064
on their night to remember

686
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,984
and touched off
one of the loudest, wildest,

687
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:43,405
wettest victory celebrations
in baseball history.

688
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:48,076
Released from bondage and ridicule
after seven destitute seasons,

689
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,745
they raised the roof...

690
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:51,997
Lolly, Lolly, Lolly...

691
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,918
- Of Shea Stadium."

692
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,170
Lolly, Lolly, Lolly.

693
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:00,839
Sidney.

694
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,176
Hi, Sidney.

695
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,094
Hi.

696
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,360
Are we gonna go
to the same place?

697
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,362
- I don't know.
- Stay together.

698
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,949
Stop. Pay attention.
Stay together. Bring up the back.

699
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,867
Everybody stay together,
come on.

700
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,703
Bye. Bye.
Here.

701
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,957
Bring Leonard.
Anthony, get Leonard. It's all right.

702
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:39,920
Wait. Leonard. Len.

703
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,048
Len, come on, come on, come on.

704
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:47,552
- Please, stay with the group.
- Hurry up.

705
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,263
Come on now.
Stay together.

706
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,557
Hurry up.

707
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,355
Okay, everybody get in. Back here.

708
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:02,025
- Okay, no pushing, no pushing.
- Just hop.

709
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,861
Hey, doctor, I wanted to ask you

710
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,905
how my father is.
The same.

711
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,117
Try and make room.
Ma, maybe you shouldn't go.

712
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:13,704
Oh, no. Of course I wanna go.
Don't be ridiculous.

713
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,080
I'm gonna take the stairs.

714
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,541
It's crowded.
We'll go another time.

715
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:21,128
You can't be there, Leonard,
or the door won't close. Thank you.

716
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,796
Bert, stop jumping!

717
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,927
Sidney's going.
He's a patient, Mom.

718
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:33,140
He's not the same kind of patient.
But he's still a patient, you're not.

719
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,100
I'm your mother.

720
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,728
Are there any
other mothers going?

721
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:39,438
Joseph.

722
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,605
Wait a minute.

723
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,941
Now, what have you done
to your hair?

724
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:47,195
Yes, Bert. That's a tire.
I know it's a tire, I'm not an idiot.

725
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,322
There's your bus, Ma. There, go.

726
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,074
Have fun.

727
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,368
Don't you worry about it.

728
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:56,621
They treat me like an asshole.
We'll take care of that.

729
01:12:57,749 --> 01:12:58,790
See you guys.

730
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,834
- There.
- All right?

731
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,628
- Bye-bye.
- Come on.

732
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,758
- Rolando. Rolando.
- You go in the back.

733
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,678
Now, move on back, please.
Right here.

734
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:15,098
You ready, Leonard?
I decided not to go. I'm gonna stay.

735
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,350
Why? What's wrong?
I'm okay, just...

736
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:18,810
Bye, Leonard.

737
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,520
Wave.

738
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,359
I'm...

739
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,111
Doctor, come on already.

740
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:31,573
I'm... All right. Leonard, are you sure?
Are you all right?

741
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,826
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'll see you later.
Have a good time.

742
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,036
- We...
- Come on.

743
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:38,246
Have a good time.
I'm coming.

744
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,583
Bert.
Bye, you guys. Have a good time.

745
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,210
Bye-bye
Bert, sit down.

746
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,422
- Fish sticks, please.
- Okay.

747
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,509
- Got those french fries.
- Okay, here you go.

748
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,845
Hi. Um...

749
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:56,389
Meatloaf, please.

750
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:01,019
Here you go.
Thank you.

751
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,022
Meatloaf.
Meatloaf too.

752
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,401
Thank you.

753
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,612
There you go. Okay?

754
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:15,033
- Next.
- I'd like fish sticks.

755
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,618
Are you following me?

756
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,790
Oh, I'm sorry, I was only kidding.

757
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,543
I saw you upstairs just now.

758
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,171
Are you visiting someone?

759
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:29,798
Uh, no.

760
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,591
You work here.

761
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,719
I live here.

762
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,097
You're a patient?

763
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:38,598
That's a dollar 80, baby.

764
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,268
You don't look like a patient.
Heh, heh.

765
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:43,812
I don't?

766
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,281
Can I help you?

767
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,581
I've always loved Carnegiea,
haven't you?

768
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,457
Dr. Sayer.

769
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,794
What is it, Anthony?
Did you choose this place?

770
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:09,045
Why?

771
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,505
I always come here.

772
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,966
Why? I mean,
don't get me wrong, doc.

773
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,259
This is a nice place.

774
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:17,596
But after the first hour,
it loses something.

775
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,599
Anthony seems to think
the group is bored.

776
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,434
They are.

777
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:25,312
I thought about taking them
to the opera house.

778
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,355
The opera?

779
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:32,152
The Museum of Natural History...
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

780
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,280
Just a lot of dead stuffed things.
You know:

781
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,699
Oh, well, um...

782
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,785
Where else is there?

783
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:23,828
Is it legal again?
Yes, for some time.

784
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:26,790
What can I get you?
Well...

785
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,918
A Rob Roy on the rocks.
A what?

786
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,379
Could you make that
a virgin Rob Roy?

787
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,679
I work the night shifts at this diner.

788
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:45,517
So sometimes before work,
I'll come see my father.

789
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,353
He used to go to all the games,

790
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:52,440
so I like to read him
the sports pages.

791
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,528
I don't even know if he knows
I visit him or not.

792
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,447
My mother doesn't think so.

793
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:01,866
But you do.

794
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:08,039
Well, sometimes
I think I see something.

795
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,167
You know, I think I see a change.

796
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,463
And for a moment,
I see him like he was.

797
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,549
You know, before the stroke.

798
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,052
And then it's gone.

799
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,972
I don't even know if I saw anything.

800
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,266
Does that make any sense?

801
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:28,393
Yeah. Yes.

802
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:36,568
Okay, my troop, back to the ward.

803
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,529
Come on. Danny.

804
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:43,616
Bill, Deon. Come on.
Put your fork down. Let's go.

805
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,745
So why are you here?

806
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,164
Come on, hurry up.

807
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,583
I receive medication.

808
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:53,209
For what?

809
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,754
Let's go, come on.

810
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,632
Without it,
I'm sort of like your father.

811
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:09,142
But I'm okay now.

812
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:11,644
That's good. Heh, heh.

813
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:36,920
Please. No. No.

814
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,383
I agree.

815
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,834
Thank you, Rose. Ay!

816
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,336
And I was so sure

817
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:21,714
he was over-easy with bacon,
wheat toast and black coffee,

818
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:24,551
I brought him his food
without taking his order.

819
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:27,178
Know what he says?
"You forgot the tomato."

820
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,682
Did you bring it?
No. We were out of them.

821
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,643
That's why I didn't get it
in the first place.

822
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,523
Visiting hours
are from 3 to 6 every day.

823
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,025
Good afternoon.
Bainbridge Hospital.

824
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,736
Well...

825
01:19:44,572 --> 01:19:46,698
it was really nice talking to you,
Leonard.

826
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:48,533
It was nice talking to you too.

827
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:53,705
Bye-bye.
Bye.

828
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,125
Paula?
Yeah?

829
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:58,960
He knows.

830
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:01,754
Your father.

831
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:03,631
He knows you visit him.

832
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:10,597
Bainbridge Hospital.

833
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:12,932
See you.

834
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,354
Well, I could interrupt.

835
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,732
One moment, please.

836
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,485
Come on. I want you
to meet a wonderful man.

837
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:27,572
Can you believe this?
Doctor, these are my friends.

838
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,240
Hello.
He's my doctor.

839
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,117
Isn't he the cat's meow?

840
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:32,952
I wanna show you the sunroom.

841
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:49,260
Miriam, I don't know how to tell you
this, so I'm just going to say it.

842
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,304
Your husband...

843
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:59,354
He was granted a divorce from you
in 1953.

844
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,025
Thank God.

845
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:12,450
Whoa. Look at that.
Pontiac Firebird 400 engine.

846
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:15,787
Firebird.
Oh, now, that's a car.

847
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,289
Morning, Lucy,
may I have your hand?

848
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,709
Take me away from this place.

849
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,092
Rum. Right here.

850
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:33,429
I guess I lose.
Well, I guess your luck is changing.

851
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:36,516
Very nice.

852
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:40,645
How's it going?
How's it going?

853
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,355
Yeah. How do you feel?

854
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:48,903
Well, my parents are dead,
my wife is in an institution,

855
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,992
my son has disappeared
out West somewhere.

856
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,746
I feel old and I feel swindled.

857
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,498
That's how I feel.

858
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:07,171
I stopped by the hobby shop.

859
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,757
I got more pencils.

860
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,720
And I got this.

861
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:17,223
A small T-square.

862
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,183
That's Good.
Oh, I can use that.

863
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,769
Oh, good, okay. Good.

864
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,856
Let's start a new room.
Hi, Leonard.

865
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,360
Hi.

866
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,949
That's really nice.

867
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,411
I'll be right back.

868
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,205
Leonard.

869
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:49,714
He never talked about girls before.

870
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,801
He certainly never had
anything to do with them.

871
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:58,681
It's a bit ridiculous,
all this girl business.

872
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,392
Don't you think?
He's a grown man, Mrs. Lowe.

873
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,895
You know what he said to me?

874
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:05,980
I should take a vacation.

875
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:09,067
I should go away for a few days
and relax.

876
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:12,111
I'm sure he meant you deserve
a vacation, which you do.

877
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,574
I can't leave him alone in this place.

878
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,284
He'd die without me.

879
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:23,581
Girls.

880
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:37,929
- Hello?
- Hello?

881
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:39,806
Dr. Sayer?

882
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:43,101
Dr. Sayer, I've gotta talk to you.

883
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,437
Leonard?
Yes. I think it's important...

884
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:50,024
I think it's important
some things were said that...

885
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:51,901
Well, I just gotta talk to you.

886
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,319
What kind of things?

887
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,947
Things that matter,
that have happened to me,

888
01:23:56,115 --> 01:23:58,783
things that I've come
to understand. Things.

889
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:01,285
Where are you calling from,
Leonard?

890
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,121
Your office.

891
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,289
It's very late.

892
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,125
Is it?
Leonard.

893
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:11,129
You stay there, I'll be right over.
Good.

894
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:22,306
Leonard? Leonard?

895
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,643
Dr. Sayer, sit down. Sit down.

896
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,896
Why? What's wrong?

897
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:32,150
We've got to tell everybody.
We've got to remind them.

898
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,653
Remind them how good it is.
How good what is, Leonard?

899
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:42,076
Read the newspaper.
What does it say? All bad.

900
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,494
It's all bad.

901
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:47,582
People have forgotten what life's about.
Forgotten what it is to be alive.

902
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,167
They need to be reminded.

903
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:52,211
Reminded of what they have
and what they can lose.

904
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:57,175
And what I feel is the joy of life,
the gift of life, the freedom of life,

905
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:58,718
the wonderment of life.

906
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:02,221
He kept saying that people
don't appreciate the simple things.

907
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:06,100
Work, play, friendship, family. It's...

908
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:09,979
And he was so excited,
he talked till 5:00 in the morning.

909
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:12,940
I don't know whether
this is liberation, mania...

910
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:16,194
Or love?
Yes.

911
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:19,864
What he's saying is right though.
We don't really know how to live.

912
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:22,325
But at 5 in the morning...

913
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,203
Waheedah. How are you?

914
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,206
I'm fine.
Very good.

915
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:51,562
Mr. Lowe? Are you all right?
Yeah.

916
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,910
What is it that you want now?
The simplest thing.

917
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,079
And that is?

918
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:14,627
To have the choice to go for a walk
if I want to, like any normal person.

919
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:19,757
You are free to go for a walk.

920
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:23,094
I am? Alone?

921
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:27,390
What difference would that make?

922
01:26:27,558 --> 01:26:29,600
Look, I'm not a criminal.

923
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,688
I've committed no crime,
I'm not a danger to myself or to others.

924
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:37,942
And yet, I'm still not allowed to go
for a walk on my own by myself.

925
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:42,321
You didn't wake a thing,
you woke a person.

926
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:43,823
I am a person.

927
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,743
Mr. Lowe, are you at all aware

928
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:51,831
of the unconscious hostility you're
exhibiting toward us right now?

929
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:54,125
How can I be aware
if it's unconscious?

930
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:55,877
Nora, please.

931
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:02,049
I'm curious. What would you
do if you went out?

932
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:09,557
I'd go for a walk, I'd look at things,
I'd talk to people.

933
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:12,643
I'd decide if I wanna go
in this direction, or that direction,

934
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:14,604
or straight ahead.

935
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,481
I would do all the things
that you take for granted.

936
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:23,321
And that's it?
That's it.

937
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:30,453
All right, then, we'll certainly
take this into consideration,

938
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:32,830
and we'll let you know.

939
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

940
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:44,425
Dr. Sayer.

941
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,013
Are you all right?
Yeah. I was aware of that.

942
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,724
It was nothing. I was nervous.
What did they say?

943
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:57,188
They said there was
insufficient data at this time.

944
01:27:57,356 --> 01:28:01,901
That continued observation was
necessary for a complete diagnosis.

945
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:06,072
They said it's a different world out there
and you may not be prepared for it.

946
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:09,617
They couldn't be held responsible
for what might happen to you.

947
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:12,203
They said no.

948
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:20,211
And what did you say?

949
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:24,215
They don't have to listen to me.
Did you agree with them?

950
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,385
Yes.

951
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:33,474
Leonard, I don't think
we're out of the woods yet.

952
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:36,394
I'm not sure that this is nothing.

953
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:38,229
It's an experimental drug.

954
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,564
We need time
to evaluate things before...

955
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:44,068
Bye.
Leonard.

956
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:45,903
Leonard.

957
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,906
Leonard, where are you going?

958
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:50,658
For a walk.

959
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:54,245
Leonard. Leonard.

960
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:01,168
This is Dr. Sayer.

961
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:03,754
Dorquez, please call the pharmacy.

962
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:06,257
Miss Dorquez,
call the pharmacy, please.

963
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:14,598
Where are you going?
I'm going outside.

964
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,101
No. Patients not allowed
beyond this point.

965
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:19,103
I'm going for a walk.
No, no. I'm sorry.

966
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:22,189
Please, don't make it hard
on yourself.

967
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:26,819
- I got him. I got him.
- Leonard, stop.

968
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:29,947
- I just wanna go for a walk.
- He's not a mental patient.

969
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:33,617
This is unnecessary. Let him go.
Please, he's not violent.

970
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:36,245
He's not violent.
He is not a mental patient.

971
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:39,665
Will you let go? You will hurt him.
Will you let go of him?

972
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,377
Will you stop, please?
Let go of him.

973
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:47,923
I don't understand it.
He was never any trouble before.

974
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:51,469
He was quiet and polite
and respectful.

975
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,637
He never demanded anything.

976
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,473
He was never disobedient.

977
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,892
Because he was catatonic,
Mrs. Lowe.

978
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,979
I'm speaking of when he was a boy.

979
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:05,357
I'm sorry.

980
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:08,402
I don't know who that is up there.

981
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:11,030
I don't think he knows.

982
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:14,825
You've turned Leonard
into something he's not.

983
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:19,497
It's not us that's defective, it's them.
We're not in crisis, they are.

984
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,248
- Yeah.
- They are.

985
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:24,335
We've been through the worst
and survived. They haven't.

986
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:27,588
They fear it. They fear it.
Right.

987
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:30,174
- Because they know.
- They know. They know.

988
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:32,343
- They know.
- They know.

989
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:33,928
They know, they know

990
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:37,681
because we remind them...

991
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:42,186
We remind them
that there's a problem...

992
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:45,189
There's a problem
that they don't have an answer to.

993
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,651
And they'll never be healers
until they realize this,

994
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:54,240
until they start to see the problem,
until they admit there is a problem.

995
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:57,618
And that the problem isn't us.
We're not the problem.

996
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,954
It's them. They're the problem!

997
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:03,541
It's them!
They're the problem.

998
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:05,793
They're the problem.

999
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:09,922
They're the problem!
They're the problem! It's them!

1000
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,299
They're the problem!

1001
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:18,139
He's lived 30 years
without the ability to release anger.

1002
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,473
As have the others.

1003
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:22,393
I think his behavior
is more natural than the others.

1004
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:26,689
Oh, really? His tics, his paranoia,
these are signs of normal behavior?

1005
01:31:26,857 --> 01:31:29,275
Yeah, because he's in that place.
Oh, is that it?

1006
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:32,153
Yes, we wake him up
and then lock him up in a cage.

1007
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,780
That's not paranoia, that's a fact.

1008
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:38,284
The fact is, I've got 20 psychotics
up there refusing to eat.

1009
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:41,245
Now, they have no idea
why they're refusing to eat.

1010
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:45,082
How long should I let that go on?
He knows why. He wants out.

1011
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:48,711
Dr. Sayer, Mr. Lowe is not
the messiah of Ward 5.

1012
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:50,963
He's a man in trouble.

1013
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:54,133
He wasn't resurrected,
he was administered a drug by you.

1014
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:57,261
A drug that's fallen short
of its miraculous reputation.

1015
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,555
The others are fine.
They show no signs...

1016
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,432
He's been on it longer, doctor.

1017
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,898
Now, I sympathize with him,
I've tried to accommodate him.

1018
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:12,776
But I will not let him endanger
the health of the rest of the patients.

1019
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:20,784
It will help if you wait for me
out there.

1020
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:22,369
Thank you.

1021
01:32:23,914 --> 01:32:25,122
Excuse me.

1022
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,625
- Excuse me.
- We can't allow it.

1023
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:29,877
He's all right.

1024
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:35,090
He's all right.

1025
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,770
How are you today?

1026
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:50,731
I'm all right. How are you?

1027
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:53,901
Never better.

1028
01:32:56,529 --> 01:32:58,489
What's the purpose
of these gentlemen?

1029
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:01,992
Oh, these gentlemen protect me.

1030
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:05,996
I wish I didn't need them.
Someone's trying to hurt you?

1031
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:08,999
Who?
Who? Heh, heh.

1032
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,669
That's the thing, isn't it? Who?

1033
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:15,422
One never knows.
Someone I least expect, I expect.

1034
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,008
Look at history.

1035
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:23,013
Leonard, every patient on this ward
thinks there's a plot against him.

1036
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:25,182
They're mistaken, they're crazy.

1037
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,066
You've gotten worse.

1038
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,863
The drug's not working.

1039
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:44,576
All these things you're experiencing
are side effects.

1040
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,287
They're making you behave this way.

1041
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,540
I appreciate you coming to see me,
but I have things to do.

1042
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:52,251
Leonard, Leonard,
please, look at yourself.

1043
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:55,713
No, look at yourself.
I have a sickness.

1044
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:59,883
Sickness took me out of the world,
and I fought to come back.

1045
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:05,639
I fought for 30 years, 30 years,
and I'm still fighting.

1046
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,725
But you have no excuse.
Me?

1047
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,436
Nothing to do with me.
You have no excuse.

1048
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:13,230
You're just a scared and lonely man
with nothing.

1049
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:16,275
No life, nothing.
You're the one that's asleep.

1050
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:21,655
Your medicine could be taken away.
They can do that.

1051
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:26,702
You could wake up in the morning
and it won't be there.

1052
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,291
Leonard.

1053
01:34:33,043 --> 01:34:34,752
Get away from me!

1054
01:34:51,353 --> 01:34:54,146
I'm all right. Thank you.

1055
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,191
I just fell. I'm fine.

1056
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:01,899
Sayer.

1057
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:21,543
Help me.

1058
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:40,521
Can you walk?

1059
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:44,608
I won't let them take
the medicine away, Leonard.

1060
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:46,777
We'll work together with it.

1061
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:53,742
All we're saying is you're taking
an unnecessary risk.

1062
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:57,454
He's had a reaction to the drug.
He has acquired some tics.

1063
01:37:57,622 --> 01:38:00,499
But he's not as concerned
with his appearance

1064
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:03,627
as the affect it may have
upon the other patients.

1065
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,129
We'll be working with his dosage.

1066
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:08,465
He's aware,
and he's prepared for any effects.

1067
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:10,801
But he wants the others
to be prepared as well.

1068
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:15,055
- You've gotta help me with this.
- Yes, doctor. Okay.

1069
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,362
Hey, Len.

1070
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,322
Welcome back.
Thanks.

1071
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:37,578
Hi, Leonard.
How you doing?

1072
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,454
How you feeling?
You all right?

1073
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:42,833
Gee, it's swell to see you.
What's up, Bert?

1074
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:48,255
It got so quiet around here.
Ha, ha. Because we're waiting for you.

1075
01:38:57,682 --> 01:39:00,100
That's wonderful, Miriam.

1076
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:06,523
You're looking good, Len.
You're looking better every day.

1077
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:07,983
Yeah?

1078
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:15,991
What if he's just had enough of it?

1079
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:19,369
What if it's just a matter of time
for all of us?

1080
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:24,916
There's no reason to think

1081
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:27,753
what's happening to Leonard
will happen to you.

1082
01:39:28,254 --> 01:39:29,254
Why not?

1083
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:33,050
Well, you're all individuals.

1084
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:36,094
And you're well.

1085
01:39:37,055 --> 01:39:38,930
Aren't you?
Yes.

1086
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,990
That was lovely, Lucy.

1087
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:01,912
I learned that song
a long, long time ago.

1088
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:07,250
I know what year it is.

1089
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:13,757
I just can't imagine
being older than 22.

1090
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,926
I've no experience at it.

1091
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:20,931
I know it's not 1926.

1092
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,310
I just need it to be.

1093
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:42,202
How are you, Leonard?

1094
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:44,830
Never better.

1095
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:53,296
How are the others?
Are they talking about me?

1096
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,215
They're scared.

1097
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:57,467
Well, they should be.

1098
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:04,391
Can you stop this?

1099
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:06,476
I'm not sure, but I'm trying.

1100
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:09,938
Don't give up on me.
I won't.

1101
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:25,495
Four twenty-five, yes.
Four twenty-five. Okay.

1102
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:28,999
Here we go, 425.

1103
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:34,921
I got a postcard from my son.

1104
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:37,340
I'm all right,
and then everything stops.

1105
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,843
Look at this,
I got a postcard from my son.

1106
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:42,512
No warning,
it's like a light switch going off.

1107
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,014
It happens that fast.

1108
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:46,475
Something has to happen
to bring me back.

1109
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:49,603
A sound or a touch.

1110
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:52,606
And then I can move again,
I'm okay again.

1111
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:54,316
Thanks.

1112
01:41:58,321 --> 01:42:01,239
It's not that it feels bad,
it's just that it's nothing.

1113
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:05,076
I feel nothing, like I'm dead.

1114
01:42:07,163 --> 01:42:11,208
Nothing.

1115
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:14,544
Gets to be like I'm not
a person anymore.

1116
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:17,214
Just a collection of tics.

1117
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:20,258
Not that I mind them necessarily.

1118
01:42:20,426 --> 01:42:23,094
Sometimes they make life
kind of interesting.

1119
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:25,972
Though I'm not sure who's in control,
me or them.

1120
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:29,392
What I do mind is knowing
that they shouldn't be there.

1121
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:32,646
Back to 5.

1122
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:34,898
Okay. Five. Five.

1123
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:46,284
Just a little more. Just...
Okay, all right.

1124
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:49,955
It feels good when I'm working.
I feel good here.

1125
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:54,292
Book list is coming along well.
I'd love to see it.

1126
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:56,461
It's here somewhere.

1127
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:04,386
That's all right,
some other time.

1128
01:43:07,849 --> 01:43:10,141
Leonard. Leonard.
Ugh!

1129
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,937
What's happening?
You're having an oculogyric crisis.

1130
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:15,605
Get the camera.

1131
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:18,316
Get the camera.
Get the camera.

1132
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:20,360
Oh, God.

1133
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:31,288
I can't do this.
I'm turning the camera off.

1134
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:32,956
No, no. Watch, watch, watch.

1135
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:35,000
Watch, watch, watch.

1136
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:41,464
Learn, learn, learn.

1137
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:44,175
Learn for me. Learn.

1138
01:43:44,886 --> 01:43:46,636
Let's see this

1139
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:51,766
- Six twenty-five.
- All right, 625.

1140
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:55,061
Six seventy-five, if... Just...
Six seventy-five.

1141
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:56,313
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1142
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:14,831
I can't read anymore.

1143
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:17,792
I can't keep my eyes in one place.

1144
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,503
I keep going back
to the beginning, beginning,

1145
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:22,881
beginning, beginning,
beginning...

1146
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:28,011
I've let everybody down. I have.
No.

1147
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:30,180
I've let you down.
No, you have not.

1148
01:44:30,348 --> 01:44:34,351
I have, I have. I'm grotesque.
You are not. It's not true.

1149
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:37,312
I won't listen to you talk like this.
I'm grotesque. Look at me.

1150
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,731
Look, and tell me I am not.
Tell me I'm not.

1151
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:42,108
You're not.
Well, this isn't me.

1152
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:44,694
This is... This isn't me.

1153
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:03,880
When my son was born healthy,
I never asked why.

1154
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:06,508
Why was I so lucky?

1155
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:10,303
What did I do to deserve
this perfect child?

1156
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:12,722
This perfect life?

1157
01:45:13,015 --> 01:45:14,391
But when he got sick,

1158
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:18,186
you can bet I asked why,
I demanded to know why.

1159
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:20,772
Why was this happening?

1160
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:27,946
There was nothing I could do about it.
No one I could go to and say:

1161
01:45:28,114 --> 01:45:34,577
"Stop this. Please, stop this.
Can't you see my son is in pain?"

1162
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:40,417
My son is in pain. Please, stop this.

1163
01:45:41,711 --> 01:45:44,587
He's fighting, Mrs. Lowe.
He's losing.

1164
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:12,282
Here you go.

1165
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:14,826
Uh, I worked,

1166
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:18,246
had friends over, went dancing.

1167
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:20,331
That's about it, not much.

1168
01:46:20,499 --> 01:46:22,292
That's great, you know.

1169
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:26,838
I've never done any of those things.
You will.

1170
01:46:30,259 --> 01:46:33,136
They'll never let me out
of this place.

1171
01:46:36,057 --> 01:46:37,974
And they shouldn't.

1172
01:46:39,852 --> 01:46:45,315
I am still not well, as you can see.

1173
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:54,491
You know,
I feel well when I see you.

1174
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,122
And...

1175
01:47:17,306 --> 01:47:20,558
I won't see you anymore.

1176
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:36,741
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1177
01:48:01,058 --> 01:48:02,475
Look.

1178
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:35,425
Isn't that sweet?

1179
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:58,651
Now?
SAYER... Whenever you're ready.

1180
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:02,405
My name is Leonard Lowe.

1181
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:06,367
It has been explained to me
that I have been away

1182
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:08,161
for quite some time.

1183
01:51:10,456 --> 01:51:11,748
I'm back.

1184
01:51:13,459 --> 01:51:15,251
What's it like to be back?

1185
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:19,547
I thought it was a dream at first.

1186
01:51:19,715 --> 01:51:22,592
What made you realize
it wasn't a dream?

1187
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:27,263
When I spoke
and you understood me.

1188
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:51,662
You told him I was a kind man.

1189
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:56,793
How kind is it to give life

1190
01:51:57,336 --> 01:51:59,796
only to take it away again?

1191
01:52:01,507 --> 01:52:04,384
It's given and taken away
from all of us.

1192
01:52:07,304 --> 01:52:09,555
Why doesn't that comfort me?

1193
01:52:11,642 --> 01:52:14,310
Because you are a kind man.

1194
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:29,200
Because he's your friend.

1195
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:07,989
The summer was extraordinary.

1196
01:53:08,157 --> 01:53:11,367
It was a season of rebirth
and innocence.

1197
01:53:11,535 --> 01:53:13,202
A miracle

1198
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:17,707
for 15 patients and for us,
their caretakers.

1199
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:22,712
But now we have to adjust
to the realities of miracles.

1200
01:53:24,047 --> 01:53:27,884
We can hide behind the veil of
science and say the drug failed.

1201
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:31,053
Or that the illness itself
had returned.

1202
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:36,726
Or that the patients were unable to cope
with losing decades of their lives.

1203
01:53:36,977 --> 01:53:40,062
But the reality is
we don't know what went wrong

1204
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:42,773
any more than we know
what went right.

1205
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:49,405
What we do know is,
as the chemical window closed,

1206
01:53:51,408 --> 01:53:54,035
another awakening took place.

1207
01:53:57,915 --> 01:54:02,835
That the human spirit
is more powerful than any drug.

1208
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:07,590
And that is what needs
to be nourished.

1209
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:15,806
With work, play, friendship, family.

1210
01:54:18,352 --> 01:54:20,603
These are the things that matter.

1211
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:25,733
This is what we'd forgotten.

1212
01:54:30,781 --> 01:54:32,740
The simplest things.

1213
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:44,043
Well, ahem, good night.

1214
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:45,753
Good night.

1215
01:55:37,848 --> 01:55:41,350
Eleanor!
Yes?

1216
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:43,853
Um...

1217
01:55:53,614 --> 01:55:55,615
Eleanor? Um...

1218
01:55:55,782 --> 01:55:57,450
What's wrong?

1219
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:01,871
I was wondering,
what are you doing tonight?

1220
01:56:02,998 --> 01:56:04,999
If you have other plans, I...

1221
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:07,418
No, I was...
Because I was wondering...

1222
01:56:07,586 --> 01:56:10,713
You have no plans?
No, I have no, uh...

1223
01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:12,882
Because I was wondering if you...

1224
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:16,844
We... Well, you and I could, um...

1225
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:22,558
If we could, um,
go for a cup of coffee.

1226
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:25,728
Yes.

1227
01:56:26,271 --> 01:56:28,022
I'd love to.

1228
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,239
My car is over here.

1229
01:56:37,407 --> 01:56:40,076
What do you say we just walk?

1230
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:41,827
Okay.

1231
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:22,201
Let's begin.
