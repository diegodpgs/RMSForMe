1
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,540
Hey!

2
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,699
All the birds of a feather

3
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,901
Do what we love most of all

4
00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:41,182
We are the best at rhythm and laughter

5
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:43,180
That's why we love Carnaval!

6
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:47,622
Call so clear we can sing to

7
00:01:47,783 --> 00:01:50,861
Sun and nature's big moon

8
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:54,181
Dance to the music
Passion and love

9
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:57,421
Show us the best you can do!

10
00:01:57,582 --> 00:02:00,621
Everyone here is on fire

11
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:03,822
Get up and join in the fun

12
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:07,182
Dance with a stranger
Romance and danger

13
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:11,983
Magic can happen
For real in Rio

14
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:14,783
All by itself!

15
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:16,943
You can't see

16
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:18,383
it coming

17
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:21,582
You can't find it anywhere else!

18
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:24,943
lt's real in Rio

19
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:28,104
And know something else

20
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:29,665
You can't feel

21
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,384
it happening

22
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,905
You can't feel it all by yourself!

23
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:22,470
lt's okay. lt's okay.

24
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:30,552
l'll take care of you.

25
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:06,035
Stupid clock.

26
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:20,594
Good morning, Blu.

27
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,958
Come here!

28
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:38,438
Tyler Blu Gunderson!

29
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,636
You know these vitamins are good for you.

30
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:43,677
What's this?

31
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:45,918
Gotcha!

32
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,560
Enjoy the new book!

33
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:23,840
Thanks, Linda!

34
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,240
Bye, now.

35
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:29,481
Yes, Mom, l'd love to visit,
but who would take care of Blu?

36
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:32,961
Mom! They don't have kennels for parrots.

37
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:34,561
Here's your hot chocolate, Blu!

38
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:37,001
Just how you like it.

39
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:40,241
Plus, l don't trust
leaving Blu with just anyone.

40
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:42,241
No, l don't have a bird-sitter.

41
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:45,322
This is the life.

42
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:48,123
The perfect marshmallow-to-cocoa ratio.

43
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:50,361
One, two, three, four, five, six.

44
00:06:57,443 --> 00:07:01,122
Well, well, if it isn't my favorite nerd bird.

45
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:03,083
Very funny. Real mature.

46
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:06,004
Hey, pet!
Where you migrating to this year?

47
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,524
The breakfast nook?

48
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:10,884
Throw all the snowballs you want.

49
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:14,644
l'm protected by this magical force-field
called glass.

50
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,724
lt's what keeps us so toasty and warm
in here

51
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,884
while you guys are out there
freezing your...

52
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:22,485
Classy.

53
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:39,405
Are you all right?

54
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,925
l'm not really built for this weather.

55
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:45,125
Are you looking for some books?

56
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:47,686
Books? No. No.

57
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:51,286
l have come 6,000 miles looking for him.

58
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:55,647
Doctor of Ornithology?

59
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:58,367
He's magnificent.

60
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,047
Linda? Little help here. Linda!

61
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,008
Wow!

62
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,727
You're actually communicating.

63
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:13,528
Yes! l introduced myself and shook
my tail feathers counter-clockwise

64
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,208
thus deferring to his dominance.

65
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,248
l did not get that at all.

66
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,649
So, Dr. Monteiro...

67
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,569
No "Doctor," please, just call me Tulio.

68
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,330
You know,
your macaw is a very special bird.

69
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,129
ln fact, as far as we know,
Blu is the last male of his kind!

70
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,248
Really?

71
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,049
Yes,

72
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,649
and recently, we found a female

73
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,330
and our hope is to bring the two of them
together to save their species.

74
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:40,849
Well, yeah, sure, when can she come over?

75
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,890
No, no. She is in Brazil.

76
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:45,451
Blu must come to Rio de Janeiro.

77
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:49,291
Rio? Brazil?

78
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:52,330
No. No, no, no.

79
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:55,731
l never let Blu out of my sight.
He needs me.

80
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,851
No. You misunderstand.

81
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,091
lt's all arranged.

82
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:01,650
You will be with him
every step of the way.

83
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:03,211
And l will be with you.

84
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:07,613
Look, l know you're doing yourjob,
but l can't...

85
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,012
Well, Blu is very particular.

86
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:14,453
And we have our little routine here
and we're not big on travel.

87
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:16,973
Heck, he doesn't even fly!

88
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,573
But of course he can fly!

89
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:20,492
He's a perfect specimen.

90
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:21,933
What are you doing?

91
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:23,932
Don't worry, their natural instincts
always take over.

92
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,452
Wait, wait, wait! No, no!

93
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:28,732
Well, almost always.

94
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:29,932
Blu!

95
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,254
What kind of doctor are you?

96
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,774
Are you okay?

97
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:35,373
Perhaps, he's too domesticated.

98
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,773
lt was very nice of you to stop in
and squawk around

99
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,253
and throw my bird.

100
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,693
But now it's time for you to go.

101
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,894
l'm very sorry. l'm very sorry, but...

102
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:46,774
Wait, wait, Linda. Linda!

103
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,855
This could be our last chance.

104
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,015
Have a safe flight.

105
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:55,735
Linda, please, listen to me.

106
00:09:56,217 --> 00:10:00,216
lf we don't do this,
his whole species will be gone!

107
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:06,816
Just think about it.

108
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:13,856
Natural instincts!

109
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:16,896
There is nothing natural about being
thrown halfway across the room.

110
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:18,296
Well, l'll show him.

111
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,376
l can do this.

112
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:21,937
l just have to work out the physics.

113
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,097
l have quadrated my vector angles.

114
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,018
l've adjusted for wind shear.

115
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:27,697
Positive reinforcement.

116
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:28,898
Good.

117
00:10:29,658 --> 00:10:31,738
Okay, let's see.

118
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,578
Flaps open. Perfect.

119
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:35,217
Landing gear. Check.

120
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:37,459
Tail flaps. Operational.

121
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,499
And, actually, not bad.

122
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:42,419
This is it.

123
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:43,898
Let's fly.

124
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,899
Just keep it simple.

125
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,780
Thrust, lift, drag and weight.

126
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,181
Thrust, lift, drag, weight.

127
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,940
Thrust, lift, drag... Wait!

128
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,780
Blu?

129
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,781
l promised l would always look out for you,
didn't l?

130
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,900
And have l ever broken a promise?

131
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,462
l'm scared, too

132
00:11:25,623 --> 00:11:30,102
but l wouldn't make you do this
if it wasn't the right thing to do.

133
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:33,102
What do you say, Blu?

134
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:42,023
That's my big, brave boy.

135
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:45,464
And we'll be back home
before we even know it.

136
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:16,265
Your turn, Blu!

137
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:18,426
You don't want to get beak-burn.

138
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:33,466
Whoa! What is going on here?

139
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:36,346
-You arrived in time for Carnaval!
-Carnaval?

140
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:38,826
Yes, it's the biggest party in the world.

141
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:41,825
You know,
a time to have fun and dance!

142
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:44,345
Oh, my!

143
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:47,386
ls she a performer?

144
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:50,187
No, in fact, she's my dentist.

145
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,508
Dr. Barbosa!

146
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:55,068
Don't forget to floss, Tulio!

147
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:56,989
You got it!

148
00:12:57,148 --> 00:13:00,028
Come tomorrow night,
everyone will be dressed like that.

149
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,069
Not me.

150
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,188
Oh, right yeah.

151
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:17,150
l am not from here.

152
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,910
Hey, Nico, he's a tourist!

153
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:20,350
Funny, you don't look like one.

154
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,030
Really? l don't?

155
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,551
Except you got pigeon doo-doo
on your nose.

156
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:27,031
Oh, no, this is just SPF 3000.

157
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:28,670
So, are you here for Carnaval?

158
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,550
Actually, l'm just here to meet a girl.

159
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,310
-A girl!
-Yes!

160
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,870
Little word of advice,
you make the first move.

161
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:37,871
Brazilian ladies respond to confidence.

162
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:38,910
Right.

163
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,431
Yeah, it's all about swagger.
You got to puff out that chest!

164
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:43,871
Swing that tail!

165
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:47,551
Eyes narrow,
like some kind of crazy love-hawk!

166
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,032
-But first we got to bust you out.
-What?

167
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:53,352
Yeah! l'm gonna pop that cage open
like a soda can!

168
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:54,912
No, no. Wait!

169
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:56,513
No, no, no, that's okay.

170
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,072
You call that popping?

171
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:00,832
This thing is robust.

172
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,832
No, no, guys, really, l'm fine.
The cage is great.

173
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:04,151
Love the cage!

174
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,512
Suit yourself!

175
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:07,392
Don't forget, love-hawk!

176
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:10,913
Yes, yes, Bem...

177
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:12,913
And to you, as well.

178
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,673
This is the heart and soul of our aviary.

179
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:29,954
Our treatment room.

180
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,635
They really like you.

181
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:36,034
A lot.

182
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:38,475
Yes. l'm their great, big mama bird.

183
00:14:44,237 --> 00:14:45,476
Wow!

184
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:46,755
Want some?

185
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:48,356
l'm good.

186
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,196
Many of the birds here
were rescued from smugglers.

187
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:53,556
Smugglers?

188
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:57,316
Yes! And unfortunately,
the poor birds are often hurt

189
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,038
or even killed in the process.

190
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:02,117
But with proper care, they can be saved.

191
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:04,637
Look here.
This poor guy was found last night.

192
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,876
Hey, buddy! You're looking great today.

193
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:11,517
Much better, much better!

194
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:14,077
Get well soon!

195
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:18,477
So, where is Jewel?

196
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:20,638
We have a special place for Jewel.

197
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,438
She's a very spirited bird.

198
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,358
l'll say.

199
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,958
She did that?

200
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,398
Charming. Okay, l want to go home now.

201
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,238
No, no. Don't worry.

202
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:32,918
l'm going to make you look irresistible.

203
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,879
Help! Help! Let me out of here!

204
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,600
Linda!

205
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:50,080
-Maybe l should...
-No, no. Give it a chance.

206
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:04,762
Hello?

207
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:09,161
l come in peace.

208
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:16,042
Whoa. She's beautiful.

209
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:22,922
What were they talking about?
She's like an angel.

210
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:28,242
An angel who's getting really close...

211
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:35,243
You're standing on my throat.

212
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:36,924
You're an American.

213
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:40,844
Thanks. l need my throat for talking.
So, thank you.

214
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:42,444
You look like me.

215
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:44,405
Hi.

216
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:46,125
Hi, my name is Blu.

217
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:49,803
Like the cheese with the mold on it.
You know, that smells really bad.

218
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:52,044
That's stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

219
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,444
Come on. We don't have much time.

220
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,204
Wait, wait, wait.

221
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,045
-Are you ready?
-For what?

222
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,045
Wow. Okay.

223
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,525
Confidence. Crazy love-hawk.

224
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:17,807
All right.

225
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:19,446
Whoa, what are you doing?

226
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,166
What? What you wanted me to.

227
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:24,126
But just for argument's sake,
what are you doing?

228
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,607
l am trying to escape.

229
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:30,608
Yeah, escape, that's where l was going
with that thing l just did.

230
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:33,968
Wait, wait. Did you actually think
we were going to kiss?

231
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:35,408
-No! lt's not what you think.
-We just met.

232
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:36,527
Oh, my.

233
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,607
l think they need a little help.

234
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,968
l know how my feathers look,
but l am not that kind of bird.

235
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:46,367
Okay, l had nothing to do with that.

236
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,408
But, you have to admit
it's actually a pretty good song.

237
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,529
Naturally

238
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,968
Yeah, sing it, Lionel.

239
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,529
Wow. That was fast.

240
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,849
Lionel Richie works every time.

241
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,450
We should probably give them
some privacy.

242
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:16,411
l'm not so sure
l should leave Blu here alone.

243
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:17,931
No, don't worry.

244
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:20,211
Sylvio will keep an eye on them all night.

245
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:26,691
Besides, he's got Jewel.

246
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,289
Help me!

247
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,372
This is the final countdown to Carnaval!

248
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:42,892
Let's samba!

249
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,816
Come here, poor little birdie.

250
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,454
lt's okay, l got you.

251
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:18,935
l got you.

252
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,456
Excuse me.

253
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:45,417
Please, l am trying to sleep.

254
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:49,817
l'm sorry, sleepy-head,
l'm trying to escape.

255
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:53,497
Escape? Why?
This cage is awesome.

256
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,777
This...

257
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,858
What was l thinking?

258
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,098
l wouldn't expect a pet to understand.

259
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:02,457
Pet? Did you just call me a pet?

260
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,498
For the record, l am not a pet.

261
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:05,937
l am a companion.

262
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:07,376
And you know what?
Do whatever you want

263
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,377
'cause tomorrow morning,
Linda will come for me

264
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:11,137
and this whole nightmare
will be over.

265
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:12,417
lncredible!

266
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:15,776
You would rather be with a human
than with your own kind.

267
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:19,700
Well, that human has given me love
and affection for the past 1 5 years

268
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,899
whereas my own kind try to strangle me
after 1 5 seconds.

269
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,659
Yeah, well, because of them,
l've lost everything.

270
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,259
You can't trust them.

271
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,379
Of course...

272
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,820
you can trust humans.

273
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,300
Jewel? Jewel?

274
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,260
Hi, there.

275
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,261
lt was nice of you to join me for dinner.

276
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,422
l often eat alone.

277
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,622
Because, of course, my work.

278
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:54,862
l thought l was the bird nut until l met you.

279
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:56,062
Yes, right.

280
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:57,781
Do you have a favorite bird?

281
00:20:57,902 --> 00:21:01,661
Well, obviously,
l'm a blue macaw kind of gal.

282
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,261
That makes sense.
They are very handsome birds.

283
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:06,782
Actually, it's the brains
l'm more attracted to.

284
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:09,503
l'm not so impressed
by fancy feathers.

285
00:21:09,663 --> 00:21:11,223
l know exactly what you mean.

286
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,222
My favorite bird is the spotted owl.

287
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:15,023
l've always been mesmerized

288
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:16,543
by those big...

289
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:19,583
round, intelligent eyes.

290
00:21:22,624 --> 00:21:23,743
Chicken hearts?

291
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,742
Chicken hearts! Oh, gosh.

292
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,744
Hello?

293
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:00,265
Oh, Blu.

294
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:03,626
We should have never left Moose Lake.

295
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,666
This is all my fault.

296
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:09,907
No, no, Linda, Linda, please.
This is not your fault.

297
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:12,867
You're right.

298
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:14,947
lt's not my fault.

299
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,627
-lt's your fault!
-What?

300
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,307
With your little bird talk.

301
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:20,948
And that whole "save the species."

302
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:22,068
Well, you know what?

303
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,468
Squawk, squawkity, squawk, squawk!

304
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:27,349
l'm sorry. l didn't mean to curse.

305
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,628
l don't understand.

306
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,709
Sylvio is the best guard in the business.

307
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,989
So, let me get this straight.

308
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,188
You were attacked by a little white bird?

309
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,388
Yes, with this rag.

310
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:38,708
He held it to my mouth like this.

311
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,228
We're doomed.

312
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:58,029
Okay. There's no place like home,
there's no place like home.

313
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,669
How l wish l was back in my own cage

314
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,709
with my mirror and my swing,
and my little bell.

315
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:04,310
How l miss my little bell.

316
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:05,750
Play dead.

317
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,430
What? l don't need to play dead,
l'm about to have a heart attack.

318
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:10,870
Just do it!

319
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,429
Fine.

320
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:18,832
Stop twitching.

321
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:21,112
Come on, it's the twitching that sells it.

322
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:26,991
Come on in, kid.

323
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,833
Well, what do you know?

324
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:37,432
Good work, Fernando.

325
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:39,833
You see, boys?

326
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:42,033
What did l tell you about this one?

327
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:44,993
That you were going to pay him
half as much as you said?

328
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:46,434
No, you idiot.

329
00:23:46,514 --> 00:23:49,434
That he reminds me of myself
when l was that age.

330
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:51,674
Smart, resourceful.

331
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:52,795
Here you go, kid.

332
00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:56,554
Hey. This is only half
of what you promised me.

333
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:58,153
Shut up, kid.

334
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,435
What the...

335
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:04,556
l thought l told you
l needed these birds alive.

336
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:05,876
Tell me, Fernando...

337
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:07,916
does this look alive to you?

338
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:11,436
Get her!

339
00:24:11,676 --> 00:24:12,635
Come over here!

340
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:14,117
Jewel!

341
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:16,754
Come here!

342
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:24,555
Hello...

343
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:26,394
pretty bird.

344
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:28,035
What's the matter?

345
00:24:28,115 --> 00:24:29,316
Cockatoo got your throat?

346
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:30,356
Nigel!

347
00:24:30,957 --> 00:24:32,757
Alive.

348
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:34,796
To be continued.

349
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:43,396
That was your plan?
To take off and leave me? Gee, thanks.

350
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:45,356
Well, why didn't you follow me?

351
00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:48,957
Nice work, Nigel.

352
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:50,878
Yeah, nice work, Nigel.

353
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,879
The last blue macaws on earth.

354
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,800
These are worth a fortune.

355
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,159
Hey, Fernando,
hang these up in the other room.

356
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,278
Hey, birdie!

357
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,039
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out of here!

358
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,200
Who's a pretty bird? l'm a pretty bird.

359
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,760
Pretty bird, l'm a pretty bird.
l'm a pretty bird.

360
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,160
l was framed. They got the wrong guy.

361
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:24,241
Sorry, guys. Nothing personal.

362
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,642
So, what's going to happen to them?

363
00:25:36,722 --> 00:25:40,081
Don't worry, we're going to find
good homes for them.

364
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,001
Now go home to your mama.

365
00:25:42,163 --> 00:25:43,282
But l don't have a mama.

366
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:44,362
Father?

367
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,082
-Brother?
-Goldfish?

368
00:25:47,123 --> 00:25:49,042
Can we keep him, boss?

369
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:50,842
No.

370
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:54,961
So, Marcel, what's really going to happen
to those birds?

371
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:57,362
Plucked, stuffed, eaten, who cares?

372
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,081
All l know is we're going to be rich.

373
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:02,603
We're gonna be rich!

374
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,646
Come on, come on! The game is starting!

375
00:26:50,728 --> 00:26:54,085
Yes, you were very clear.
Tomorrow or the deal is off.

376
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,245
Of course l have both the macaws.

377
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,887
Yes, l will deliver them myself.

378
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,727
All right, you two...

379
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:03,928
you load the truck tonight.

380
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,728
And first thing in the morning,
we bring those birds to the airport.

381
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:07,968
You got it?

382
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:09,888
-Yeah, sure.
-All right. Heard you.

383
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:12,288
And one of you, feed Nigel.

384
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,609
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

385
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:21,568
Yes!

386
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,929
Nuh-uh, scissors cuts rock.

387
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:26,329
Oh, man. How come you always win?

388
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,528
Nice birdie.

389
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,249
Here you go.

390
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:45,688
Cannibal.

391
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,330
Okay, pull it together.
The key is not to panic.

392
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:51,451
l'm not panicking.

393
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,372
l wasn't talking to you,
l was talking to me.

394
00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:56,331
But it's okay, because any minute now,
Linda will find us.

395
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:59,491
Great. And then she'll stick us behind
another set of bars, right?

396
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:00,851
Yeah. l mean, no.

397
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:05,292
Look, pet, cages might work for you,
but l don't want to belong to anyone.

398
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:15,932
Something seems to be lodged in my beak.

399
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:17,893
Would you mind?

400
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:33,892
l know l'm not a pretty birdie...

401
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:36,253
but l used to be quite a looker.

402
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:38,174
A star.

403
00:28:39,855 --> 00:28:42,694
Lights, camera, action.

404
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,934
l was striking,
suave, ambitious.

405
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,014
Feet to beak...

406
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:48,454
so birdie-licious

407
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:51,135
Now I'm viIe, I am viIIainous,
and vicious

408
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:52,934
Oh, and malicious

409
00:28:53,095 --> 00:28:55,453
l had it all
A TV show, women, too

410
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:58,135
l was tall
Over one-foot-two

411
00:28:58,215 --> 00:29:00,734
Then they got a
pretty parakeet to fill my shoes

412
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:03,015
That's why l am so evil,
why l do what l do.

413
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:04,135
He was a super star

414
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:05,455
So young and vital

415
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:06,576
He's nasty

416
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,016
A South American ldol

417
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:09,256
He's a suspicious bird

418
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:10,456
Who said that about me?

419
00:29:10,536 --> 00:29:12,936
-A very vicious bird
-l'll have you rotisseried

420
00:29:13,058 --> 00:29:14,655
l'm a feathery freak
With a beak

421
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:15,856
A bird murderer

422
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:18,375
You think you're badder than me?
l never heard of ya

423
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,895
I'm eviI,
l'll fill your cheese balls with weevils

424
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:23,337
l poop on people
and l blame it on seagulls

425
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:25,416
lt was him.

426
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:27,937
-He's a nasty bird
-l'm invincible

427
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:30,338
-He's ghastly
-l'm un-mince-able

428
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:32,737
I'm unwashabIe, unrinseabIe

429
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:35,257
Like an abandoned school
l have no principle

430
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:37,578
All of you Brazilian birds

431
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:39,898
All 80 million birds

432
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,258
l'll tell you what l'm going to do

433
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:44,499
l'm going to make you

434
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:46,659
Shut up, now. Shut up!

435
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,899
lt's just me.

436
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,820
l will make you ugly...

437
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,700
...too.

438
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:55,741
Hey!

439
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:56,860
Sweet nightmares.

440
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:00,780
Not cool, man!

441
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:02,660
Scary, but not cool!

442
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:04,460
Hey, are you okay?

443
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:07,140
No, l am definitely not okay!

444
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:08,419
Wait. What are you doing?

445
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:10,059
Getting out of here.

446
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,541
Are you going to help me or what?

447
00:30:11,622 --> 00:30:15,220
Actually, all the survival guides say
to sit and wait, and help will come.

448
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,660
No one is coming!

449
00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:20,101
We are on our own and if we just sit here,
we're going to die!

450
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:23,620
Yes! Yes!

451
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:24,701
Yes!

452
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:26,261
No!

453
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:28,661
Nigel! Get out of the way!

454
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:30,340
Hold on!

455
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:33,861
Stop! Stop!
Why don't you just open the door?

456
00:30:34,382 --> 00:30:35,420
Are you kidding me?

457
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,182
What? lt's just a standard flip slide bolt.

458
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:38,262
Come on! Let's fly!

459
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:40,062
What are you doing?

460
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,022
-l can't.
-What? You can't what?

461
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:49,063
l can't fly!

462
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,104
You couldn't tell me this before now?

463
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,904
lt didn't matter before now!

464
00:30:57,224 --> 00:30:58,663
l hate you.

465
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:02,944
ls there anything else l need to know?

466
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,824
Yes, l can't fly, l pick my beak,
and once in a while l pee in the bird-bath.

467
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:06,865
Happy?

468
00:31:06,985 --> 00:31:07,944
There they are!

469
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:09,024
We got to get out of here!

470
00:31:09,226 --> 00:31:10,424
Just move! Move!

471
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:14,066
Wait, wait. Listen to me.

472
00:31:14,226 --> 00:31:16,185
Flying may not be my thing,
but walking is.

473
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,025
Follow my lead. lnside leg, outside leg.

474
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:19,065
Yeah, okay, l got it.

475
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:21,585
lnside, outside, inside, outside!

476
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,945
Yes! Yes! Yes!

477
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:27,146
-Yes. Yes!
-Come on!

478
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:37,307
See? l'm bilingual, too!

479
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:42,868
This is great!

480
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:44,986
l'm chained to the only bird in the world
who can't fly!

481
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:47,387
Actually, there are about 40 species
of flightless birds.

482
00:31:47,468 --> 00:31:48,786
-Duck!
-No, ducks can fly.

483
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,185
No! Duck!

484
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:22,511
Yes!

485
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:23,791
Hold on!

486
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,070
No!

487
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:41,710
Get out of here, you putrid poultry!

488
00:32:58,994 --> 00:32:59,952
What was that?

489
00:33:00,033 --> 00:33:01,033
A stick.

490
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:02,072
And that?

491
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:03,272
lt's just a rock.

492
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:04,752
Right. Yeah.

493
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:08,193
ls that a spider on my back?

494
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:09,752
Will you quit it?

495
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:11,994
lt's just a leaf. Turn around.

496
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:18,194
Leaf. Told you.

497
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:21,793
Now, come on, we need to find
a safe place to spend the night.

498
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:22,993
Safe? Safe?

499
00:33:23,154 --> 00:33:24,352
We are in the jungle.

500
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,311
You know when people say,
"lt's a jungle out there"?

501
00:33:26,394 --> 00:33:28,153
Well, l'm pretty sure
they don't mean it as a good thing.

502
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:32,073
Look, l hate to break it to you,
but this is where our kind naturally lives.

503
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:35,433
Hey, don't talk to me about nature.
I watch Animal Planet.

504
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,594
l know all about the food chain.

505
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:43,033
You see?
Out here, l'm just an hors d'oeuvre.

506
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,075
Nothing more than a feathery spring roll.

507
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,274
That is why we stay in the trees
and not on the ground.

508
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:49,595
After you.

509
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:52,275
No, l don't think so.

510
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:56,597
No. l would feel much more comfortable
in something man-made.

511
00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,876
Hey, how about up there?

512
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:05,798
l can't believe
l have to drag your clumsy butt up there.

513
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:07,278
Drag me?

514
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,798
Watch and learn.

515
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,478
Blu! Just wait one...

516
00:34:13,758 --> 00:34:14,716
Blu?

517
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:17,556
Who's dragging whose butt now?

518
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:19,437
Very funny.

519
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,318
You see? Who needs flying?

520
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:30,839
Birds. Birds need flying.

521
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,199
Flying is...

522
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:36,439
lt's freedom
and not having to rely on anyone.

523
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:39,599
Don't you want that?

524
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,679
l don't know.
lt sounds a little lonely.

525
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,920
Let's get some sleep.

526
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:48,878
l'm probably going to be up
for a little while.

527
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,199
Because l'm still on Minnesota time.

528
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,800
Good night.

529
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:55,040
Good night, Jewel.

530
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,241
Good night, Linda.

531
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:08,479
Excuse me, sir?

532
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,919
Have you seen my bird?

533
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:18,762
Excuse me?
Have you seen my bird?

534
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:56,124
Have you seen my bird? Blue feather.

535
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:57,884
Lady! American lady!

536
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:00,444
-Blu?
-Where?

537
00:36:03,646 --> 00:36:05,965
Wow. l know where your birds are.

538
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:08,165
You found Blu? Are you sure?

539
00:36:09,006 --> 00:36:09,965
lt's his!

540
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:11,205
Let me see that.

541
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,045
You're right.

542
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:19,725
Okay. Where is he?

543
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:22,085
Come on, let's go! l'll take you to him.

544
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:23,965
No, no. Linda, wait.

545
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:27,326
We don't know this boy.
We can't trust him.

546
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,446
l have to trust him.

547
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,927
l don't have a choice.

548
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:49,407
Do you think l'm an idiot?

549
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:54,688
They were two birds
chained together in a cage.

550
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,049
How could you lose them?

551
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,769
They outsmarted us, boss.
But don't worry, we'll get them back.

552
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,530
l have a plan.

553
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:03,410
Great. What are you going to do?

554
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:07,090
Wander the city calling
"Here birdie, birdie. Here birdie"?

555
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:10,490
Well, anything sounds dumb
when you say it like that.

556
00:37:11,332 --> 00:37:14,009
Okay. We have to get the birds
to the airport tonight.

557
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:16,930
But it's Carnaval.
All the roads will be blocked by the parade.

558
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:20,171
And that's why
l wanted to go this morning.

559
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:21,492
Nigel.

560
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:25,171
This bird is 1 0 times smarter
than the two of you combined.

561
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:28,732
Yeah, well, if he's so smart,
then why don't you put him in charge?

562
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,692
l am putting him in charge.

563
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,331
Stop suggesting things.

564
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:36,411
Go find them, Nigel.

565
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:49,733
lf we can't get through the parade,
we'll have to be in the parade.

566
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:56,012
Are you sure
this is going to work?

567
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:58,372
Positive. Check out my math.

568
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:02,132
Yeah, that's comforting. Thank you.

569
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:04,533
Look, let's just get this chain broken.

570
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:06,692
Right. Then we can go and find Linda.

571
00:38:07,014 --> 00:38:08,972
No, you can go find Linda.

572
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:12,694
Once this chain is off, l'm going to go
back to being free in the jungle. Deal?

573
00:38:12,776 --> 00:38:13,773
Fine. Deal.

574
00:38:21,136 --> 00:38:23,054
Nice try, brainiac.

575
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:27,855
l think something is watching us.

576
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:36,336
Be careful, Blu.
They might snuggle you to death.

577
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:40,016
Come here.

578
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:45,736
lntruders!

579
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:47,697
Cut it out!

580
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:51,257
Now stop...

581
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:55,537
No! Don't!

582
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:58,777
Attack!

583
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:02,098
Help!

584
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:03,658
What's going on down there?

585
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,899
Go, go. Off with you.

586
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,979
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

587
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,619
l've told you a thousand times.

588
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:11,340
Manoela, Sofia, come on now, listen to me.

589
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:12,538
Oh, yeah, right in the eye.

590
00:39:13,298 --> 00:39:14,658
Precious, aren't they?

591
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,377
Kids? Seventeen of them
and one on the way.

592
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:20,377
Hey! He's not a maraca, stop shaking him!

593
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,977
They're giving me gray feathers.

594
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,298
This papa needs a break.

595
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,699
So, you two lovebirds headed for Carnaval?

596
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,379
-Lovebirds?
-We're more like acquaintance-birds.

597
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:34,939
Not even that, we're more like
chained-to-each-other birds.

598
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,539
Yeah. l mean, if...

599
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:39,340
What is it with this kid and the feathers?

600
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,979
We have no idea. We're having him tested.

601
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:46,060
So, do you think you could help us
get this thing off?

602
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,061
Lucky for you, you know Rafael,
and Rafael knows everyone.

603
00:39:52,582 --> 00:39:54,701
Again with the eye.
Okay, want me to call your mother?

604
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,062
No!

605
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,143
Works every time.
They're scared to death of her.

606
00:39:58,223 --> 00:40:00,102
Call me for what?

607
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:01,342
Eva, my love...

608
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:03,902
l must take this young couple to see Luiz.

609
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:05,141
Luiz!

610
00:40:05,223 --> 00:40:07,341
You don't fool me for a second.

611
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:10,381
You and your amigo
just want to sneak off to Carnaval.

612
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:12,783
Carnaval.

613
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:17,263
That magical time when l met
the most beautiful bird in the world.

614
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:23,663
l still remember the song that was playing
when l first laid eyes on you.

615
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:27,263
Tall and tan and
young and lovely

616
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:31,025
The girl from lpanema
goes walking

617
00:40:31,144 --> 00:40:32,145
Come on, baby, sing it!

618
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:36,024
And when she passes,
each one she passes goes, ah!

619
00:40:38,865 --> 00:40:41,065
Like a river of the sweetest honey.

620
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,665
l guess love is deaf, too.

621
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:45,185
Come here.

622
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:52,464
Okay. Take them to Luiz, but hurry back.

623
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,024
You are an angel.

624
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,063
l'll miss you my juicy little mango.

625
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:59,265
l'll miss you my pudgy papaya.

626
00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:02,664
Hey! Marco! Carlos!
Put your brother down, now!

627
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:04,625
l can't believe she actually let me go.

628
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:06,706
So, how far is this Luiz?

629
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:10,065
Not far. Thirty minutes as the crow flies.

630
00:41:10,226 --> 00:41:12,226
And how long as the macaw walks?

631
00:41:12,308 --> 00:41:14,787
-Bobo here can't fly.
-But he's a bird.

632
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:15,666
Not all birds fly.

633
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:16,466
There are ostriches...

634
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:17,746
You're not an ostrich.

635
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:19,346
-Not technically, but...
-Wait.

636
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:21,747
My friends, l want to help,
but to walk the whole way...

637
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:22,826
lt can't be done!

638
00:41:22,906 --> 00:41:23,907
Where's Daddy?

639
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:25,828
-Daddy? Daddy?
-Come over here. Go back to your room.

640
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:26,868
But, hey.

641
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:28,869
We might as well give it a shot.
Let's go quickly.

642
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:31,148
No, don't look back. They sense fear.

643
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:57,670
What an adorable monkey.

644
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:15,470
Hey! My watch!

645
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:41,911
Hello, boys.

646
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:44,392
Seems like you've had a busy day.

647
00:42:44,553 --> 00:42:45,593
What? This?

648
00:42:45,753 --> 00:42:49,433
This is just some stuff we found.
Right, boys?

649
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:50,752
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

650
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,153
l'm not interested
in your nicked knick-knacks.

651
00:42:53,234 --> 00:42:55,993
Your burgled baubles bore me.

652
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,474
There are two blue macaws out there

653
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:02,234
and l need your multitude of eyes
to help me find them.

654
00:43:02,315 --> 00:43:04,954
Yeah? What's in it for us?

655
00:43:05,515 --> 00:43:06,995
Well, that's a fair question.

656
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:13,516
Let's discuss it.

657
00:43:16,277 --> 00:43:20,796
l certainly see your point, but what
could l possibly do for you in return?

658
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:22,715
Save me! Save me!

659
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:24,956
Well, that's a thought. Yeah.

660
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:27,516
But is it enough? l don't want
to feel like l'm cheating you.

661
00:43:27,596 --> 00:43:29,036
Help me! Help me! No, no!

662
00:43:29,116 --> 00:43:31,195
We'll do it, we'll do it. Save me, please.

663
00:43:31,557 --> 00:43:33,717
Save me!

664
00:43:35,678 --> 00:43:37,277
All right, you've twisted my wing.

665
00:43:37,438 --> 00:43:38,757
Deal.

666
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:41,277
Now then? Any more questions?

667
00:43:41,878 --> 00:43:43,317
No? Good.

668
00:43:43,478 --> 00:43:47,277
You will spread out and you will find
these macaws by the end of the day

669
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:49,436
or it's flying lessons for everyone!

670
00:43:49,597 --> 00:43:50,756
Go!

671
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:55,557
Go do your monkey business.

672
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,317
l've changed my mind, yeah.

673
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,879
Maybe we can find a bus schedule
or something.

674
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:16,798
Come on, you're not going to back out now.

675
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,038
Not in front of the lady.

676
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:22,559
Okay, yeah. Yeah, sure.

677
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:24,160
All right, that's the spirit.

678
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,720
You're sure you're up for this?

679
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:27,120
Yeah, yeah. l mean,

680
00:44:27,202 --> 00:44:30,641
it's not like we're just hurling
ourselves off a mountain or something.

681
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:31,681
Right?

682
00:44:31,763 --> 00:44:33,681
Actually that was
pretty much my entire plan.

683
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:34,721
What?

684
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:37,281
Don't worry, Blu, it's in your DNA.

685
00:44:37,362 --> 00:44:39,642
And if our featherless friends can do it,
how hard can it be?

686
00:44:39,722 --> 00:44:40,921
Wait, wait!

687
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:44,722
Mommy!

688
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:45,962
Fun, right?

689
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:47,602
Yeah. Fun.

690
00:44:48,363 --> 00:44:50,643
Okay. l need you two to get closer.

691
00:44:51,765 --> 00:44:56,163
Closer.

692
00:44:58,004 --> 00:44:59,003
Nice.

693
00:44:59,404 --> 00:45:00,643
Now put your wings around each other.

694
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:02,563
-What?
-Come on, amigo!

695
00:45:02,684 --> 00:45:04,403
lt's not like she's going to bite!

696
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:05,443
Will you?

697
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:06,724
We'll see.

698
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:07,562
Now,

699
00:45:07,644 --> 00:45:08,722
you flap your right wing,

700
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:12,603
you flap your left wing,
and together you fly.

701
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:15,763
But this doesn't seem
aerodynamically possible.

702
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,244
You think too much.

703
00:45:18,365 --> 00:45:22,564
Flying is not what you think up here,
it's what you feel in here.

704
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:26,004
And when you feel the rhythm
of your heart, it's like samba.

705
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:27,524
You fly!

706
00:45:32,245 --> 00:45:33,844
See? lt's easy!

707
00:45:34,005 --> 00:45:34,964
Easy?

708
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:36,724
Easy for you to say, because from here

709
00:45:36,805 --> 00:45:39,045
it looks really, really hard.

710
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:43,006
Hey, if you want to see Linda again,
this is the only way.

711
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:44,726
Okay. You're right.

712
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:46,086
-Yes, l am.
-This is for Linda.

713
00:45:46,207 --> 00:45:47,286
-Right.
-Keep it simple.

714
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:49,606
-Easy breezy.
-Thrust, lift, drag...

715
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:50,805
-Come on! Let's go!
-Wait!

716
00:45:50,887 --> 00:45:53,045
-lnside, outside, inside, outside.
-lnside, outside, inside, outside.

717
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:54,165
Come on, Blu! You can do it!

718
00:45:54,246 --> 00:45:55,286
l can do it. l can do it.

719
00:45:55,366 --> 00:45:55,925
l can do it.

720
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:57,485
l can't do it!

721
00:45:58,247 --> 00:45:59,206
Not again!

722
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:11,128
-Am l dead?
-No!

723
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:12,848
We're still alive!

724
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:26,529
Wow! This is incredible.

725
00:46:37,852 --> 00:46:38,809
Wow.

726
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,647
This is the most beautiful thing
l've ever seen.

727
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,609
See what you've been missing?

728
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,289
Yeah.

729
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,969
All right, Blu, you're flying!

730
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,850
Sort of. Not really, but do you feel it?

731
00:46:56,051 --> 00:46:57,050
Yes!

732
00:46:57,932 --> 00:46:59,491
l do feel it.

733
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:13,811
No, no, Blu! Wait!

734
00:47:25,054 --> 00:47:26,532
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

735
00:47:27,734 --> 00:47:29,174
We're gonna die!

736
00:47:55,216 --> 00:47:57,696
You did not feel it in here.

737
00:47:57,856 --> 00:47:59,056
You think?

738
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,055
Let's catch a ride to Luiz.

739
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:06,415
Hurry, you two!

740
00:48:07,976 --> 00:48:08,977
Okay.

741
00:48:09,377 --> 00:48:11,016
Last of the species here.

742
00:48:11,536 --> 00:48:12,577
Move it!

743
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:14,096
Hey. Wait up.

744
00:48:14,218 --> 00:48:15,256
Come on, lovebirds!

745
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:19,217
You made it.

746
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:21,896
l would love to go five minutes
without almost getting killed.

747
00:48:21,977 --> 00:48:23,055
ls that too much to ask?

748
00:48:23,137 --> 00:48:25,856
For a bird who can't fly, yeah.

749
00:48:31,096 --> 00:48:33,138
They're starting to close off the streets
for Carnaval.

750
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,897
You better be right, kid.
Because we're running out of time.

751
00:48:48,378 --> 00:48:50,338
l'll never be able to get my car
through this crowd.

752
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:51,978
Don't worry, l'm on it.

753
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:56,778
Watch it!

754
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,141
Hey, kid, how did you get this bike?

755
00:48:59,221 --> 00:49:01,340
-l traded it for your Jeep.
-What?

756
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:03,661
Yeah, it's in great condition.

757
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:06,660
Well, good condition!

758
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:08,662
Hey! Out of the way!

759
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:10,220
Look out!

760
00:49:12,181 --> 00:49:13,620
Hold on!

761
00:49:27,383 --> 00:49:30,022
l'm going to chew through my own leg
if this doesn't come off soon.

762
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,741
Relax. lf l know Luiz,
we're right where we want to be.

763
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:34,062
Hey! Rafi!

764
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:36,662
lf it isn't the king of Carnaval!

765
00:49:36,782 --> 00:49:38,862
Nico! Pedro! What up, family?

766
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:40,622
Where you been hiding yourself, bird?

767
00:49:40,703 --> 00:49:41,942
Man, l thought you were dead.

768
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:43,821
Hold up! Rewind.

769
00:49:44,463 --> 00:49:46,102
Ain't that the bird from the cage?

770
00:49:46,182 --> 00:49:48,503
l think our love lessons went down smooth.

771
00:49:48,664 --> 00:49:49,742
You work fast.

772
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,903
Baby got beak.

773
00:49:51,023 --> 00:49:53,623
You was locked up
and now you're rolling with a hot-wing.

774
00:49:53,704 --> 00:49:54,983
l want to be like you.

775
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:57,423
No, it's not what you think.
We're just chained together.

776
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,824
Hey, l'm not judging you.

777
00:49:58,905 --> 00:50:00,503
-Keep it spicy.
-Oh, yeah.

778
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:02,581
Hey, guys, we're looking for Luiz.
Have you seen him?

779
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:05,222
Yeah, l seen him, but you didn't,
because you just missed him.

780
00:50:05,304 --> 00:50:07,303
He took the trolley back to the garage.

781
00:50:07,383 --> 00:50:08,342
Great.

782
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:10,583
Relax, baby bird.
You could catch the next one.

783
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:12,664
Yeah, it's time to take it to the next level.

784
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:14,264
What's wrong with this level?

785
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,784
Come on! This ain't the level.
The next level's the level.

786
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:18,344
You got to shake your tail feathers.

787
00:50:18,426 --> 00:50:20,105
We got to get this chain off first.

788
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:23,385
Come on, lovebirds! You're in Rio!
You should enjoy it!

789
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:25,586
Yeah! Live a little.

790
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,388
We got them.

791
00:50:48,909 --> 00:50:50,268
Hey!

792
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,707
Welcome to paradise!

793
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,708
Some party, huh?

794
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:01,548
This is the coolest place l've ever seen.

795
00:51:01,629 --> 00:51:04,269
Despite all the obvious
health code violations.

796
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,867
l like you!
Nothing you say makes any sense.

797
00:51:08,988 --> 00:51:10,388
All right, everyone, listen up!

798
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:12,988
Rafi has some special guests
from out of town

799
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:16,749
and let's show them some love,
because l don't think they get out much.

800
00:51:17,709 --> 00:51:21,149
Everybody put their wings together
and clap them as loud as you can.

801
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:24,029
Flap them. Clap them.
l don't care, slap them.

802
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:27,310
Party in the lpanema, baby.

803
00:51:30,192 --> 00:51:36,831
l wanna party
l wanna samba

804
00:51:37,271 --> 00:51:38,950
l wanna party

805
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:40,829
-And live my life
-My life

806
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,830
-l wanna party
-Party

807
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:44,950
And fly

808
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:47,909
High! l'm gonna fly
Fly just like a bird

809
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,990
But you are a bird

810
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:51,910
Oh, yeah, you're right
So let me fly just like a rocket then

811
00:51:51,991 --> 00:51:53,431
-Okay
-Fly so high

812
00:51:53,512 --> 00:51:55,511
Where l need to come down for oxygen

813
00:51:55,992 --> 00:51:59,071
'Cause once we start it
Baby, ain't no, ain't no stopping then

814
00:51:59,873 --> 00:52:02,833
'Cause l just want to live my life
and party

815
00:52:03,273 --> 00:52:05,873
All l want is to be free
And rock my body

816
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:06,912
Okay

817
00:52:07,113 --> 00:52:08,353
l've been around the world

818
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:10,513
And l want to live my life in Rio

819
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:12,873
'Cause l Rio, 'cause l Rio realize

820
00:52:12,954 --> 00:52:14,234
What are you doing?

821
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:15,793
l don't know.

822
00:52:16,915 --> 00:52:18,075
All right, Blu!

823
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:19,555
And fly!

824
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:23,955
I'm that samba, samba master
Master, master, master, master

825
00:52:24,035 --> 00:52:27,714
Push out sound from a ghetto blaster
BIaster, bIaster, bIaster, bIaster

826
00:52:28,197 --> 00:52:29,674
Hey. She likes you.

827
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:31,554
What are you talking about?
Haven't you been listening?

828
00:52:31,635 --> 00:52:33,155
No, but l've been watching.

829
00:52:33,355 --> 00:52:35,313
Just be yourself. Go on.

830
00:52:36,114 --> 00:52:37,553
-l wanna samba

836
00:52:46,795 --> 00:52:48,795
And fly

837
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,359
You two are coming with me.

838
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,519
ln your little monkey dreams.

839
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,199
Yeah.

840
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,680
That was meant for you.

841
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,080
Come on. Can we all just get along?

842
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,120
This isn't your fight, big-nose.

843
00:53:46,402 --> 00:53:49,080
You mess with my friends,
you mess with me!

844
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:50,399
And us!

845
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:52,920
Yeah, little King Kong.

846
00:54:00,763 --> 00:54:02,361
l don't know what's going on here.

847
00:54:02,443 --> 00:54:04,321
Birds versus monkeys!

848
00:54:04,401 --> 00:54:05,400
Get them!

849
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:12,880
Yippee-kai-yay, monkey man!

850
00:54:22,403 --> 00:54:23,842
Yee-haw! Giddy-up!

851
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:29,682
Missed!

852
00:54:33,843 --> 00:54:35,002
We got to go!

853
00:54:36,603 --> 00:54:38,202
Need a lift?

854
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:52,804
Take that, you funky monkey!

855
00:54:57,926 --> 00:54:59,963
-Thank you!
-Anytime!

856
00:55:00,044 --> 00:55:01,205
That's what l'm talking about!

857
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:02,725
Man, we threw down!

858
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:03,764
Yeah, we threw down.

859
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:05,724
You guys were like fire and ice.

860
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:07,365
-Thunder and lightning!
-Hip and hop!

861
00:55:07,447 --> 00:55:09,486
Cheese and sprinkles!

862
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:11,886
lt's a Minnesota thing.

863
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:15,326
You see?
Nothing you say makes any sense.

864
00:55:19,407 --> 00:55:20,727
Come on, follow me.

865
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:28,287
What?

866
00:55:29,847 --> 00:55:32,087
But the birds were here.

867
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:33,446
Yeah, sure they were, kid.

868
00:55:33,527 --> 00:55:35,526
l swear, the birds were right here.

869
00:55:35,687 --> 00:55:37,926
-Well, how do you know?
-Because

870
00:55:38,408 --> 00:55:40,608
l'm... l'm the one who took them.

871
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:41,767
You!

872
00:55:41,928 --> 00:55:45,288
l didn't want to hurt anybody,
l needed the money.

873
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:47,448
But Fernando, l trusted you!

874
00:55:47,529 --> 00:55:48,728
l know, but...

875
00:55:50,529 --> 00:55:52,247
Man, that's good.

876
00:55:53,008 --> 00:55:54,288
Hey, guys.

877
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:55,728
What are you doing here?

878
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:59,047
l just wanted to see
if you had any work for me.

879
00:55:59,209 --> 00:56:02,529
Well, if you were here two hours ago,
you could've helped us load the...

880
00:56:03,049 --> 00:56:04,769
-What?
-Shut up.

881
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,088
So, why are you guys dressed for Carnaval?

882
00:56:08,249 --> 00:56:11,008
So no one will notice us
when we smuggle these...

883
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:12,688
Shut up!

884
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,009
We made a float.

885
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:18,049
A float!

886
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,370
So you guys are going to the parade.
Can l come?

887
00:56:20,531 --> 00:56:22,130
l'm a great dancer.

888
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:25,369
Can he come? Come on, please.
Three is better than two.

889
00:56:26,292 --> 00:56:28,330
Fine. We got to hurry though.

890
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:30,451
l almost forgot.

891
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:33,612
Where did l put it?
l thought it was right here.

892
00:56:35,574 --> 00:56:36,532
There it is.

893
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:37,972
Got it.

894
00:56:38,373 --> 00:56:39,691
Let's go.

895
00:56:40,253 --> 00:56:41,412
Hurry up, kid.

896
00:56:41,572 --> 00:56:43,211
Can he ride on the plane with us, too?

897
00:56:43,812 --> 00:56:44,571
Shut up!

898
00:56:45,012 --> 00:56:47,413
No. We can't let them get on that plane.

899
00:56:49,732 --> 00:56:52,693
You can drive a motorcycle, right?

900
00:56:53,374 --> 00:56:54,893
You insult me.

901
00:57:03,773 --> 00:57:06,213
No, l can't drive a motorcycle.

902
00:57:17,455 --> 00:57:20,254
lt's just like riding a snowmobile.

903
00:57:37,735 --> 00:57:39,374
What happened?

904
00:57:39,454 --> 00:57:40,455
Papa?

905
00:57:40,535 --> 00:57:42,296
What happened?

906
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:47,695
Oh, no! Let me go.

907
00:57:47,777 --> 00:57:49,416
Stop your chirping and talk to me!

908
00:57:49,496 --> 00:57:51,616
No, no. l don't know anything. Help!

909
00:57:51,697 --> 00:57:56,336
When l bite down on your head,
will it go "pop," or will it go "crack"?

910
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,896
Where are the cerulean birds?

911
00:58:00,058 --> 00:58:01,617
That means blue, by the way.

912
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:03,978
They escaped. Went to Luiz.

913
00:58:04,178 --> 00:58:05,418
Anything else?

914
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:07,379
They said you were very nice.

915
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,900
Did they?

916
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:10,778
Liar.

917
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,739
And handsome, too.

918
00:58:15,261 --> 00:58:17,899
Never send a monkey to do a bird's job.

919
00:58:39,259 --> 00:58:41,500
Don't worry. l got it.

920
00:58:46,861 --> 00:58:49,540
There he goes. That's my boy.

921
00:58:53,301 --> 00:58:55,020
ls it hot? l think l'm sweating.

922
00:58:55,102 --> 00:58:58,021
l didn't even think that
was biologically possible, and yet, look.

923
00:58:58,103 --> 00:58:59,061
Wow.

924
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:00,862
Yeah, that's your boy, all right.

925
00:59:00,942 --> 00:59:02,701
Okay, so he needs a little help.

926
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,142
Come on, let's give him some.

927
00:59:04,222 --> 00:59:05,741
Set the mood.

928
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:10,821
All right, look, l'm on it.
l know how to set the mood. Check it out.

929
00:59:10,902 --> 00:59:12,341
Get a, Get a, Get a
Get a girl

930
00:59:12,422 --> 00:59:13,781
Get, Get, Get
Get a girl

931
00:59:13,862 --> 00:59:16,902
Take her, take her to the fIoor
Show her, show her how you roll

932
00:59:16,983 --> 00:59:19,942
Drop it, drop it, drop it low
Drop it low, drop-drop it low

933
00:59:20,142 --> 00:59:21,463
What kind of mood is that?

934
00:59:21,544 --> 00:59:23,063
Pedro, Pedro, a little too aggressive.

935
00:59:23,224 --> 00:59:26,062
l'm not hating on your creativity,
but l think l got this one.

936
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:27,302
Follow my lead.

937
00:59:34,385 --> 00:59:36,545
Now, that's more like it.

938
00:59:43,386 --> 00:59:46,025
Wasn't really thinking
Wasn't looking

939
00:59:46,106 --> 00:59:49,587
Wasn't searching for an answer

940
00:59:50,907 --> 00:59:53,906
ln the moonlight

941
00:59:54,707 --> 00:59:58,385
When l saw your face

942
00:59:59,107 --> 01:00:02,425
Wow! What a beautiful sunset.

943
01:00:02,505 --> 01:00:04,065
Yeah.

944
01:00:05,425 --> 01:00:06,426
Blu.

945
01:00:06,506 --> 01:00:10,025
Down here. Just tell her,
"You have beautiful eyes."

946
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:11,746
That's good. Great idea.

947
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:14,826
l have beautiful eyes.

948
01:00:16,107 --> 01:00:18,586
Yeah, okay. Sure, they're nice.

949
01:00:18,787 --> 01:00:21,627
No, her eyes. Her eyes.

950
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:24,747
Right, yeah. Your eyes,
your eyes are great, not mine.

951
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:25,946
l mean, mine are okay.

952
01:00:26,028 --> 01:00:28,987
But yours, l bet
you can see right through them.

953
01:00:29,948 --> 01:00:31,107
Blu!

954
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:34,147
Just tell her how you feel.

955
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:37,108
-Jewel.
-Yeah.

956
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:40,308
l've been wanting to tell you that l...

957
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:41,549
That l...

958
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,269
How sweet. You're getting choked up.

959
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:47,948
You're choking! Okay! All right!

960
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:53,748
Come on, Blu, move with me.
Stay with me, Blu.

961
01:00:53,869 --> 01:00:56,388
One more, come on. One more time!

962
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,669
Yep, that's my boy.

963
01:01:12,912 --> 01:01:16,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
l give you Luiz's garage.

964
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:22,672
-After you.
-No, no, you first.

965
01:01:22,752 --> 01:01:23,831
Please, l insist.

966
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,352
Okay.

967
01:01:28,632 --> 01:01:30,272
Guess this is it.

968
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,672
Yeah. Quite an adventure.

969
01:01:32,753 --> 01:01:34,072
End of the line.

970
01:01:34,153 --> 01:01:35,112
Yes.

971
01:01:35,193 --> 01:01:37,512
Guess things like this
don't happen in Tiny-soda.

972
01:01:37,672 --> 01:01:38,911
Tiny-soda?

973
01:01:39,072 --> 01:01:41,312
-Wait, Minnesota.
-Yeah.

974
01:01:41,672 --> 01:01:43,751
That's very good.
That's very funny actually.

975
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:46,911
Luiz! Are you here, Luiz? Hey, buddy!

976
01:01:47,273 --> 01:01:49,632
l got some friends l want you to meet.

977
01:01:52,554 --> 01:01:53,673
Go!

978
01:01:54,034 --> 01:01:56,472
lnside, outside, inside, outside!

979
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:06,194
l got you's good.

980
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:07,794
What?

981
01:02:07,915 --> 01:02:11,154
l could've ripped your throats out,
but l didn't.

982
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:14,114
But l could've.

983
01:02:14,195 --> 01:02:17,315
Hey, Luiz! Stop scaring my friends.

984
01:02:17,397 --> 01:02:19,755
Hey, Rafi, come here!

985
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:21,555
Where you've been?

986
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:23,036
You look good.

987
01:02:23,116 --> 01:02:26,116
Wait. Luiz is a bulldog?

988
01:02:26,237 --> 01:02:28,034
You got something against dogs?

989
01:02:28,116 --> 01:02:29,874
l do when they're drooling on me.

990
01:02:31,516 --> 01:02:33,115
lt's a medical condition.

991
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:34,876
No, hey, amigo, we really need you.

992
01:02:34,957 --> 01:02:37,317
-She's mean, bro.
-Luiz, come on, please, please.

993
01:02:38,357 --> 01:02:39,796
We need your help.

994
01:02:42,399 --> 01:02:44,439
l think l know what to do.

995
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:53,958
Are you sure this is safe?

996
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:56,277
Sure. There's nothing to it.

997
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:59,597
Now, if something goes wrong,
scream really loud!

998
01:02:59,678 --> 01:03:02,317
Because l can't hear too good
with this thing on.

999
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,719
Hey, Rafi! Get the switch, please.

1000
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,599
Don't worry. He's a professional.

1001
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,638
Now, try not to move!

1002
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,197
l can't really see out of this thing, either!

1003
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:41,321
Hey! Where did you go?

1004
01:03:58,644 --> 01:03:59,762
Gross.

1005
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:01,962
But l'm free.

1006
01:04:02,123 --> 01:04:03,882
Jewel! Jewel! We're free!

1007
01:04:04,044 --> 01:04:05,404
Slimy, but free.

1008
01:04:05,565 --> 01:04:07,564
Contaminated probably, but free.

1009
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,402
Can you believe it's finally...

1010
01:04:11,604 --> 01:04:12,843
...over.

1011
01:04:14,045 --> 01:04:15,163
Yeah!

1012
01:04:16,684 --> 01:04:18,644
Come on, guys, let's go!

1013
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:21,884
What are we standing around for?
lt's Carnaval!

1014
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:32,204
Oh, yeah!

1015
01:04:34,365 --> 01:04:35,525
Yep.

1016
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:37,643
l know just how you feel.

1017
01:04:38,286 --> 01:04:39,364
Watching them up there

1018
01:04:39,444 --> 01:04:42,604
makes you want to chase them
and grab them in your mouth

1019
01:04:42,766 --> 01:04:44,885
and bite their heads off, huh?

1020
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:49,686
l'm just kidding, bro.

1021
01:04:49,847 --> 01:04:51,966
Yeah, chasing them is plenty.

1022
01:05:02,288 --> 01:05:05,567
l'm flying, flying just like a bird!

1023
01:05:05,726 --> 01:05:07,845
Jewel, but you are a bird!

1024
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:14,127
Hey! Where you going?

1025
01:05:15,928 --> 01:05:16,888
Blu?

1026
01:05:19,728 --> 01:05:20,928
Blu, what's wrong?

1027
01:05:21,568 --> 01:05:23,689
Nothing. Everything is perfect.

1028
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:27,088
You'll be off to the rainforest, l'll be
back with Linda, just like we planned.

1029
01:05:27,848 --> 01:05:30,528
Hey, birds!
Stop yapping and start flapping!

1030
01:05:30,688 --> 01:05:31,728
Let's go!

1031
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:34,408
l guess, l thought, maybe...

1032
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,290
What? That you'd come to Minnesota?

1033
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:38,211
Great, l guess l'll knit you a scarf.

1034
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,531
No, that's not what l meant.

1035
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,611
Look, Jewel,
l can't spend my life

1036
01:05:42,691 --> 01:05:44,931
walking around following you
wherever you're going.

1037
01:05:45,092 --> 01:05:47,529
Hey, it's not my
fault you can't fly.

1038
01:05:49,731 --> 01:05:51,010
Awkward.

1039
01:05:51,091 --> 01:05:52,210
Okay, okay.

1040
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:55,330
You know what? This is good.
Just clear the air.

1041
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:57,209
Just be completely honest
with each other.

1042
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,930
You want honesty?
Fine, l can be honest.

1043
01:06:00,012 --> 01:06:01,091
l don't belong here.

1044
01:06:01,171 --> 01:06:03,811
ln fact, l never wanted to come here
in the first place.

1045
01:06:03,971 --> 01:06:05,850
And... And...

1046
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:07,650
And you know what?

1047
01:06:07,812 --> 01:06:09,090
l hate samba.

1048
01:06:11,772 --> 01:06:13,931
Hey! That's a little too far.

1049
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:15,771
Make the mean bird take it back.

1050
01:06:15,852 --> 01:06:17,330
Yeah, l said it.

1051
01:06:17,412 --> 01:06:19,572
Every song sounds exactly the same.

1052
01:06:19,652 --> 01:06:22,571
Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya
Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya

1053
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,293
l'm tico, taco out of here.

1054
01:06:25,853 --> 01:06:28,014
Fine! See you around, pet!

1055
01:06:28,094 --> 01:06:29,493
No, wait, wait. Come back!

1056
01:06:29,614 --> 01:06:33,494
You belong together!
You are Juliet to his Romeo!

1057
01:06:33,814 --> 01:06:37,332
Sure, they both die in the end,
but you get my point!

1058
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,692
Young love. Always so melodramatic.

1059
01:06:41,854 --> 01:06:44,053
All right, boys, go after her.

1060
01:06:45,054 --> 01:06:48,053
Blu! Come back here. Come on!

1061
01:06:48,494 --> 01:06:50,413
Yeah! l'm ready for Carnaval!

1062
01:06:50,575 --> 01:06:52,494
Who wants to ride in my

1063
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,213
fruit.

1064
01:06:54,976 --> 01:06:56,535
You left without me.

1065
01:06:56,616 --> 01:06:58,295
That's messed up.

1066
01:07:04,095 --> 01:07:05,735
Jewels! Jewels!

1067
01:07:05,816 --> 01:07:07,616
Wait up!

1068
01:07:12,377 --> 01:07:14,617
Going somewhere, pretty bird?

1069
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:17,898
Yeah. l was just on my way
to claw your eyes out!

1070
01:07:17,978 --> 01:07:19,138
Jewel!

1071
01:07:20,978 --> 01:07:22,458
Temper, temper.

1072
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:23,897
Now come along, my dear.

1073
01:07:23,978 --> 01:07:25,896
We're going to a parade.

1074
01:07:25,977 --> 01:07:29,176
Everybody loves a parade.

1075
01:07:30,377 --> 01:07:31,696
Let go of me!

1076
01:07:32,337 --> 01:07:33,936
Hey! Get back here!

1077
01:07:34,778 --> 01:07:37,856
Ain't nobody messing with a friend
of Pedro, l ain't having it!

1078
01:07:37,938 --> 01:07:39,018
lt's on!

1079
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:41,698
Did you see the talons on that guy?

1080
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:42,738
Talons?

1081
01:07:42,818 --> 01:07:44,978
Maybe it's on next time.

1082
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:47,818
-Help!
-Help! Little help!

1083
01:07:52,899 --> 01:07:55,178
Rafael, quit following me.

1084
01:07:55,339 --> 01:07:58,537
You're going in the wrong direction.
lsn't Carnaval that way?

1085
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:00,138
l'm not going to Carnaval.

1086
01:08:00,219 --> 01:08:01,619
No, l'm going home.

1087
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,978
But l thought you loved Carnaval.

1088
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:06,300
l do. But l love my family much more.

1089
01:08:06,381 --> 01:08:09,140
And that's a choice l made with this.

1090
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:11,100
Not with this.

1091
01:08:11,181 --> 01:08:12,620
-Blu!
-Hey, Blu! Blu!

1092
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:14,821
l was flying
and then l saw this big cockatoo!

1093
01:08:14,902 --> 01:08:16,099
With big ninja talons!

1094
01:08:16,181 --> 01:08:18,140
This cockatoo was ugly!
Anyway, that's not the point.

1095
01:08:18,221 --> 01:08:20,460
And then Jewel was there,
and he snatched Jewel up.

1096
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,899
Like, he snatched her up.
And then he was like,

1097
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:23,579
"You're coming with me,
you little princess."

1098
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:25,219
And Jewel was like,

1099
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,620
"l ain't your princess, leave me alone."

1100
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,220
-And l was like, "What?"
-Then he was like, "What?"

1101
01:08:28,301 --> 01:08:29,741
Stop! Just tell me what happened.

1102
01:08:29,902 --> 01:08:31,061
He got Jewel, man!

1103
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:32,541
And he's taking her to the parade.

1104
01:08:33,502 --> 01:08:35,621
This is all my fault.

1105
01:08:36,623 --> 01:08:37,902
Let's fly.

1106
01:08:40,103 --> 01:08:42,742
Carnaval, here we come!

1107
01:08:43,784 --> 01:08:45,783
Hey, dog, l'm drowning back here!

1108
01:08:45,944 --> 01:08:48,582
You will get wet on this ride!

1109
01:08:52,664 --> 01:08:54,344
Come on, come on, come on.

1110
01:08:54,504 --> 01:08:56,582
Where are these guys?

1111
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,024
Yes. Nice.

1112
01:09:05,585 --> 01:09:07,062
Very nice.

1113
01:09:07,904 --> 01:09:10,943
Marcel!

1114
01:09:12,743 --> 01:09:14,103
Oh, boy.

1115
01:09:14,785 --> 01:09:16,543
We're a chicken!

1116
01:09:18,025 --> 01:09:19,824
Come on, Fernando! Dance!

1117
01:09:22,186 --> 01:09:23,624
ldiots.

1118
01:09:26,226 --> 01:09:27,305
Excuse me.

1119
01:09:28,626 --> 01:09:29,945
Coming through!

1120
01:09:30,106 --> 01:09:31,185
Watch your feet.

1121
01:09:31,266 --> 01:09:32,665
Whoops! Sorry.

1122
01:09:33,465 --> 01:09:35,384
Go ahead. Come in.

1123
01:09:35,747 --> 01:09:37,146
Wait. Stop, please.

1124
01:09:37,586 --> 01:09:39,586
Performers only.

1125
01:09:53,548 --> 01:09:54,628
Wow.

1126
01:09:55,147 --> 01:09:57,227
Cyanopsitta spixii.

1127
01:10:06,628 --> 01:10:07,748
Tulio?

1128
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,709
Linda. l was just...

1129
01:10:20,351 --> 01:10:22,549
l look ridiculous, don't l?

1130
01:10:36,991 --> 01:10:38,470
Sorry.

1131
01:10:39,232 --> 01:10:41,191
The parade. lt's about to start.

1132
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:42,271
Okay.

1133
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:44,072
Go ahead.

1134
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,189
Okay, just follow my lead.

1135
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,350
Act naturally.

1136
01:11:03,032 --> 01:11:04,072
Are you okay?

1137
01:11:04,153 --> 01:11:05,111
-Yeah.
-Come on.

1138
01:11:05,273 --> 01:11:06,752
-Blu?
-Blu!

1139
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:09,632
Blu! Blu!

1140
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:13,311
What? Wait, wait! No, no.

1141
01:11:13,393 --> 01:11:16,512
l am looking for a bluebird. Birdo?

1142
01:11:17,074 --> 01:11:18,193
Birdo! Yes!

1143
01:11:18,793 --> 01:11:20,072
Okay.

1144
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,633

This is not good. This is not good. This is...

01:11:45,196 --> 01:11:46,795
Cheese and sprinkles.

1150

Hey. Keep dancing, egg-boy.

1154
01:12:12,957 --> 01:12:15,437
One down and one to go.

1155
01:12:15,519 --> 01:12:17,038
You'll never find him.

1156
01:12:17,398 --> 01:12:18,997
He's already gone.

1157
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:20,678
l don't need to find him.

1158
01:12:20,838 --> 01:12:22,877
He'll find you.

1159
01:12:27,838 --> 01:12:29,637
This is the spit!

1160
01:12:31,197 --> 01:12:32,358
Yeah, baby!

1162
01:12:35,078 --> 01:12:36,036
Luiz, please!

1163
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,838
Rescue first. Freak later.

1164
01:12:39,078 --> 01:12:41,479
-Come on!
-Out of my way, people!

1165

Linda! Linda!
You've got to shake your tushy!

1174
01:13:16,242 --> 01:13:19,162
No! We don't shake our tushies

1175
01:13:22,162 --> 01:13:23,960
Hot dog! Coming through!

Blu, we found them!

1185
01:14:02,165 --> 01:14:04,004
She's on some weird chicken float!

1186
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:05,284
Come on!

1187
01:14:07,765 --> 01:14:08,763

1191
01:14:28,887 --> 01:14:29,846
What?

1192
01:14:32,687 --> 01:14:33,646
There they are! That's the float!

1193
01:14:35,407 --> 01:14:37,767
That float is a crime in itself!

1194
01:14:51,489 --> 01:14:52,528
There he is!

1195
01:15:06,249 --> 01:15:07,889
-Hey, Jewel.

1197
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:12,129
No, Blu, you can't be here.
You have to go. Nigel...

1198
01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:15,329
Hello, pretty bird.

So kind of you to join our little soirée.

Come on. You really think l came alone?

1202
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,091
craziest birds in all of Rio
right behind me.

1203
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:28,250
You heard that, guys? We're saved!

1204
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:31,130
-That's right. That's right.

1205
01:15:32,452 --> 01:15:37,172
Love. lt's such a powerful and stupid thing.

1206
01:15:44,492 --> 01:15:47,171
Yes. Well done, Nigel.

1207
01:15:50,771 --> 01:15:52,971
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1208
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:54,091
Out of the way.

1209
01:15:54,892 --> 01:15:57,133
Sorry. Wait! Wait!

1210
01:15:58,372 --> 01:16:00,652
We actually made it! Hey, Marcel!

1211
01:16:00,813 --> 01:16:03,013
Can we do this again next year?
Please? Please?

1212
01:16:03,134 --> 01:16:04,734
Could l drive next year, too?

1213
01:16:06,214 --> 01:16:07,653
Wait! Come back!

1214
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,735

1218
01:16:44,616 --> 01:16:46,215
-What do you think you're doing?
-Nothing.

1219
01:16:46,296 --> 01:16:48,656
You shouldn't have done that.
Come on.

1220
01:16:57,658 --> 01:16:58,696
Just forget him!

1221
01:16:58,857 --> 01:17:00,056
Get the birds!

1222
01:17:04,098 --> 01:17:05,056
They're getting away.

1223
01:17:06,737 --> 01:17:08,656
We'll see about that.

1224
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,658
Watch out!

1225
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:20,098
We did it, boys.

1226
01:17:20,179 --> 01:17:22,298
-Yes! We did it.
-We're the best!

1227
01:17:22,379 --> 01:17:24,378
ls that a float?

1228
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:27,378
Wow! Look at the detail on that thing.

1229
01:17:27,539 --> 01:17:29,097
Pull up you, idiot! Pull up!

1230
01:17:41,901 --> 01:17:44,582
Blu! Blu!

1231
01:17:46,022 --> 01:17:47,260
Oh, Blu.

1232
01:18:04,862 --> 01:18:07,662
Sorry, Eva,
l'm not gonna be home for dinner.

1233
01:18:15,103 --> 01:18:16,062
What are you doing?

1234
01:18:16,142 --> 01:18:18,941
l'm gonna pop this cage open
like a soda can.

1235
01:18:26,904 --> 01:18:28,463
Now, that's popping!

1236
01:18:29,184 --> 01:18:30,743
Hurry. We got to help the others.

1237
01:18:31,184 --> 01:18:33,904

Who's a pretty bird? l'm a pretty bird.

1238

Go! Go! Go!

1243
01:19:06,706 --> 01:19:07,905
Freedom!

1244
01:19:08,306 --> 01:19:09,665
Geronimo!

1245
01:19:14,306 --> 01:19:15,666
Come on! Come on!
We need to get out!

1246
01:19:15,748 --> 01:19:17,427
Wait, wait, wait!

1247
01:19:21,667 --> 01:19:24,506
lt's okay. Hey, it's okay.

1248
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:27,626
We'll figure this out together. Right?

1249
01:19:31,068 --> 01:19:32,068
Let him go!

1250
01:19:35,629 --> 01:19:36,267
Jewel!

1251
01:19:36,828 --> 01:19:37,787
My wing.

1252
01:19:38,669 --> 01:19:39,628
Pity.

1253
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,748
Now we have two useless,
flightless birds.

1254
01:19:49,549 --> 01:19:51,389
Not cool, man. Not cool!

1255
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:04,388
We're going down!

1256
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,390
-Okay, okay.
-Rock, paper, scissors...

1257

Chute!

1258
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:11,349

Hey! Wait for us!

1260

Blu, you're crazy! What are you doing?

1264
01:20:39,753 --> 01:20:41,234
l'm not gonna let you go!

1265
01:20:41,394 --> 01:20:44,152
We're chained-to-each-other birds,
remember?

1266
01:21:03,315 --> 01:21:04,433
Wow.

1267
01:21:05,355 --> 01:21:07,313
Blu! You're flying!

1268
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:08,474

1270
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:15,154
You're right, l'm not an ostrich.
l'm not an ostrich!

1271
01:21:19,955 --> 01:21:21,035
What?

1272
01:21:29,477 --> 01:21:30,516
Dad! Look!

1273
01:21:35,755 --> 01:21:37,195

1274
01:21:43,157 --> 01:21:44,356

lt's Blu! Look, Tulio, it's Blu!

1277
01:21:51,158 --> 01:21:52,557
And he's flying.

1278
01:21:52,798 --> 01:21:54,438
My Blu is flying!

1279
01:21:54,559 --> 01:21:55,317
He's flying.

1280
01:22:11,521 --> 01:22:13,440
Here, let me see.

1281
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,279
Don't worry.

1282
01:22:18,481 --> 01:22:20,160
l'll take care of you.

1283
01:22:49,922 --> 01:23:01,683
That's my big, brave boy.

1284
01:23:06,324 --> 01:23:08,562
All the birds of a feather

1285
01:23:09,643 --> 01:23:12,002
Do what we love most of all

1286
01:23:12,884 --> 01:23:16,043
Moon and the stars
Strumming guitars

1287
01:23:16,204 --> 01:23:20,282
That's why we love Carnaval

1288
01:23:24,484 --> 01:23:27,883
Loving our life in the jungle

1289
01:23:27,965 --> 01:23:31,085
Everything's wild and free

1290
01:23:31,246 --> 01:23:34,524
Never alone
'Cause this is our home

1291
01:23:34,605 --> 01:23:37,564
Magic can happen for real

01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:39,324
ln Rio

1293
01:23:39,565 --> 01:23:41,446
All by itself

1294
01:23:41,566 --> 01:23:42,606
By itself

1295
01:23:42,727 --> 01:23:45,885
You can't see it coming

1296
01:23:46,086 --> 01:23:47,805
You can't find it anywhere else

1297
01:23:48,206 --> 01:23:49,564

l'm the samba master

1306

Beauty and love
What more could you want?

1307
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:07,646
Fantasy can be for real

ln Rio
