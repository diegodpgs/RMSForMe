Hey, guys!

- Ho! Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.
- Hey!

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,872
<i>A- And I think we should give</i>
<i>a special thanks to the people...</i>

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,520
<i>responsible for our</i>
<i>record-breaking sales,</i>

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,754
- <i>Scott Calvin and Susan Perry!</i>
- Yeah!

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,958
<i>Let's hear it for 'em!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,555
<i>Susan, darling, come on up here.</i>
<i>Aren't they adorable?</i>

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,989
<i>Say a few words.</i>

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,674
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>This was really a team effort,</i>

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,314
<i>and I would just want to thank</i>
<i>every one of you individually...</i>

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,039
<i>But we don't have time</i>
<i>for that, do we?</i>

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,236
<i>In all seriousness,</i>
<i>um, here at B&R Toys,</i>

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,397
<i>we're not just about makin'</i>
<i>a profit in quality toys.</i>

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,954
<i>We're also about families.</i>

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,355
<i>But our families aren't</i>
<i>here with us right now.</i>

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,995
<i>Which is probably why Johnson's</i>
<i>secretary is sittin' in his lap.</i>

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,548
<i>You guys have a great party,</i>

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,359

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,910
<i>Aren't they wonderful?</i>

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,195
Laura, I was hopin' to catch you
before you'd left your house.

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,070
I ran real late today. You wouldn't
believe the traffic out here.

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,875
Yeah, same to you!
And that's not very ladylike!

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,115
Anyway, I'll try to get
to my house as soon as I can.

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,754
Oh, there's the problem right there.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,155
Three car pile-up.
I'm really gonna be late.

All right. Let's go.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,673
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Neal.

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,112
- Oh, sorry I'm late. Hi.
- Hi.

53
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,993
- Did you want to come in for a minute?
- Neal's waiting in the car, so...

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,914
- Why doesn't he come in?
- 'Cause, Daddy, he says you'll
just end up saying something snotty.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,754
Not necessarily. Could be rude
or sarcastic. Whatever it takes.

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,751
- See? I gotta go. Here.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,473
Christmas Eve.
Just for a minute.

58
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,354
Watch those steps.
They're real slippery.

59
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,874
- Ooh!
- Told ya.

60
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,998
- So...
- Well...

61
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,958
- You goin' to your mom's for dinner?
- Actually, we're gonna be
with Neal's family.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,911
Ah, Christmas at the pound.

63
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,956
There aren't that many
presents over there.

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,076
Well, that's because
Santa isn't here yet.

65
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,315
Neal doesn't believe
in Santa.

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,555
Well, Neal's head
comes to a point.

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,513
- He's smart. He's a doctor.
- He's not a doctor. He's a psychiatrist.

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,511
Take your coat off.
You're stickin' around, aren't ya?

69
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,630
I'll be right there.
Just a sec.

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,076
- I just want to...
- Did that jerk tell Charlie
there was no Santa Claus?

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,750
What? No. Oh, Charlie came home
from school the other day in tears,

72
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,156
because some big kid told him
there was no such thing as Santa.

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,356
And, you know Neal.
Well, he sat him down and...

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,271
He told him that
there was a Santa Claus.

75
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,318
Well, all he said was that
Santa was more like a feeling.

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,834
You know, more like
a state of mind than a person.

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,954
Kind of like Neal.
And who gave you permission
to tell Charlie there's no Santa Claus?

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,436
I think if we're gonna destroy our son's
illusions, I should be a part of it.

79
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,829
- Yeah, but you're never around,
are you, Scott?
- Oh, oh, please.

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,959
Listen, all we are trying to do is
give Charlie a firm grasp on reality.

81
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,430
That's a good idea. You don't want kids
runnin' around usin' their imaginations.

82
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,353
Oh, yeah. This from the guy responsible
for the Do-It-All-For-You-Dolly.

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,795
- Leave her out of this.
- <i>Don't you burp me, don't you change me</i>

84
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,111
- <i>I'm the dolly...</i>
- Why do you guys always have to fight?

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,270
I, uh, swear we're not fighting.
It's your mom's singing.

86
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,710
It sounds a lot like fighting,
doesn't it? Cats even.

87
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,998
The trouble is, Neal and your mom,
they don't believe in Santa
because they were real naughty.

88
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,554
Which is why they'll probably get
lumps of coal in their stockings.

89
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,395
I don't know. It seems kind of babyish
to believe in that kind of stuff.

90
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,631
What are you talkin' about? I believe
in Santa Claus. I'm not a baby.

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,676
- Well...
- Maybe it's time you left.

92
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,230
We don't want to keep
Dr Pinhead waiting.

93
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,828
Come here.

94
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,272
Do I gotta stay?

95
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,878
Listen, you and your daddy are
gonna have a great Christmas, okay?

96
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,514
- Will you pick me up tomorrow?
- Of course.

97
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,431
- Early?
- Yes.

98
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,670
We're talking sunup?
You're here?

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,352
You'll be fine. Ah, merry
Christmas, Charlie. I love you.

100
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,510
I love you too, Mom.

101
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,318
- You be a good boy, okay?
- Bye, Mom.

102
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,996
Four hours?

103
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:50,991
<i>I'm dreamin'</i>

a real good cook.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,117
Yeah, and you should see him
walk on water.

117
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,839
- You don't like him
very much, do ya, Dad?
- Charlie, yeah...

118

I was just kiddin' around.

Lash out irrationally?

122
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,951
- Where did you hear that?
- From Neal.

123
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,395
I learn a lot from him.
He listens to me.

124
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,914

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,389
This is nice.

144
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,832
"And Mama in her kerchief
and I in my cap...

145
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,474
- <i>I'm dreaming</i>
- "had just settled down
for a long winter's nap.

146
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,994
- <i>Of a white</i>
- "When out on the lawn,
there arose such a clatter,

147
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,548
- <i>Christmas</i>
- "I sprang from my bed
to see what was the matter.

148
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,070
"Away to the window
I flew like a flash.

149
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,513
"With a miniature sleigh and St.
Nich... and Prancer and Dancer...

150
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,955
...and to all a good night."

151
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,670
- What's that?
- What's what?

152
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,751
"A Rose Suchak ladder"?

153
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,435
It's not a ladder.
I said, "arose such a clatter."

154
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,636
It means, eh,
"came a big noise."

155
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,557
What?

156
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,958
Charlie, "arose" is a word
that means "it came,"

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,911
and "clatter"
is a big noise.

158
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,837
Now, please, go to sleep.
Shut your eyes.

159
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,638
How do reindeer fly?
They don't have any wings.

160
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,076
- Fairy dust?
- That's from <i>Peter Pan,</i> Dad.

161
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,720
- Horns.
- Antlers.

162
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,429
Whatever.
Their, uh, antlers give them...

163
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,478
You know, ther... ther... there's
a slipstream effect... The air go...

164
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,391
T-They move fa...
They're weightless.

165
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,996
- But if Santa's so fat, how
did he get down the chimneys?
- He sucks it in like Grandpa.

166
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,271
But what about people
who don't have fireplaces?
How does he get into their house?

167
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,797
Charlie, sometimes believing
in something means you...

168
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,871
means you just
believe in it.

169
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,714
Santa uses reindeer to fly because
that's how he has to get around.

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,712
But you do believe
in Santa, right, Dad?

171
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,159
Of course I believe in Santa.
Now, please, go to sleep.

172
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,392
- Dad?
- What is it, Charlie?

173
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,718
Maybe you better leave some cookies
and milk out, just in case, okay?

174
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,673
Great. I'll just go
preheat the oven.

175
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,235
And don't forget
the fire extinguisher.

176
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,675
Good night, Charlie.

177
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,274
Ho!

178
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,350
Now, settle down there.

179
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,190
Dad! Dad!

180
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,869
- W-What?
- I heard a clatter.

181
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,434
- What, Charlie?
- There! A clatter!

182
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,274
- Charlie, what are you talkin' about?
- You know, "it came a big noise."

183
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,237
It's coming from outside.

184
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,436
Charlie, it's just
the wind or somethin'.

185
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,080
Come on.
Let's go back to bed.

186
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,508
- Somebody's on the roof.
- Maybe it's Santa.

187
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,434
Not now, Charlie.
I want you to sit here,
and I want you to stay right there.

188
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,756
- Charlie, do you know how to call 911?
- Sure. 911.

189
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,229
Yeah. Great. Stay there.

190
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,719
- Hey, you!
- What's that...

191
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,150
Whoa! Whoa! Wh-Whoa!

192
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,758
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, buddy.

193
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,312
All right, you should
just stay still. Perfect.

194
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,996
- You got him!
- Charlie, stay where you are.

195
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,992
Charlie, would you listen to me?
Stay up there!

196
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,629
It is Santa!
You killed him.

197
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,274
Did not.
And he's not Santa.

198
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,794
Well, he was.

199
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,157
He's got some I.D.
On him, I bet.

200
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,351
Fella, if you can hear me, I'm just
lookin' for your identification.

201
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,673
Once I figure out who ya are, I'll...
I'll give you a lift back to the mall.

202
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,150
"If something should
happen to me, put on my suit.
The reindeer will know what to do."

203
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,471
Yeah, right.

204
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,270
Whoa.

205
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,512
- Dad!
- Hey.

206
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,511
He disappeared.

207
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,549
- Whoa!
- He's naked somewhere.

208
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,353
- You gonna put on the suit
like the card said? Are you?
- No. No.

209
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,716
- Come on, Dad. I wanna go too.
- Stop it, Charlie.
We're not goin' anywhere.

210
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,112
- You never do what I wanna do!
- Would you please be quiet for a minute
so I can figure this out?

211
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,353
Reindeer up on the roof.
Santa suit layin' on the ground.

212
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,228
Guy fell. Not my fault.

213
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,995
Reindeer on the roof.
That is hard to explain.

214
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,749
It's the ladder.

215
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,597
Where the hell'd
this come from?

216
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,116
Look here, Dad.
"The Rose Suchak Ladder Company."

217
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,716
- Huh?
- "Out by the roof
there's a Rose Suchak ladder."

218
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,839
- Just like the poem.
- Just like the poem?

219
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,673
Charlie, come on down from there.
Charlie, get down from there!

220
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,349
Dad! You gotta see this!

221
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,516
- Don't touch anything!
- It's great!

222
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,309
I'm just gonna call the police.
I'll carry this stuff up there.
Let them deal with it, okay?

223
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,033
Whoa! This guy was huge.

224
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,111
Dad, isn't this neat?

225
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,869
Charlie. Charlie!
Stay away from those things.

226
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,190
They're reindeer.
You don't know where they've been.

227
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,955
They all look like
they've got key lime disease.

228
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,796
Easy, Rudolph.

229
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,156
Excuse me, Comet.

230
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,993
Dad! Check out Santa's sleigh.

231
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,594
There's no such thing
as Santa's sleigh.

232
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,754
- Sure there is. You said
you believed in Santa, right?
- I did? I do.

233
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,311
What about the reindeer?
These are Santa's reindeer, aren't they?

234
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,511
I hope not.
These are, uh,

235
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,635
a gift.

236
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,831
Probably from
the cable company.

237
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,872
We're getting the Disney Channel now.
Merry Christmas.

238
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,077
- Now, hop out of there, please.
- I don't wanna go.

239
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,590
Listen, Charlie.
I'm not kidding. Let's go!

240
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,389
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yeah! Let's go! Whoa!

241
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,877
Charlie! Hold on, Charlie!

242
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,392
Whoa!

243
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,749
Giddyap, Comet!
Whoa, let's go!

244
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,394
Dad! Climb up here!

245
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,839
There we go!

246
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,629
So, uh, if we go straight
on this road, and we hit I-94...

247
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,795
Well, we made good time.
Now what do we do?

248
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,348
- Get the bag of toys.
- And do what?

249
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,477
- Go down the chimney.
- Down the chimney?

250
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,199
You want me to take
the toys down the chimney...

251
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,238
into a strange house
in my underwear?

252
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,278
No. You gotta
put the suit on first.

253
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,636
You know what we're gonna do
is we're gonna get outta here,

254
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,235
because this whole thing
is stupid.

255
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,357
How come everything
I wanna do is stupid?

256
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,271
I didn't say that.

257
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,030
Freezing my nubs off out here, and you
want me to get into a Santa costume.

258
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,350
This is great.
A Santa costume.

259
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,518
Oh, this thing.
You never know where it's been.

260
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,636
A thousand malls.

261
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,157
Well, I hope you're happy, Comet.
Hope you're happy. But most of all,

262
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,516
I hope the guy that
lives here is a tailor!

263
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,989
Nice coat.

264
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,549
Well, how do I look? Nice?

265
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,200
- You forgot the sash.
- You're right.

266
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,271
This completes the ensemble.

267
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,914
All right. Got my boots.

268
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,952
Now I've got the suit on. How
am I supposed to know what to leave?

269
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,833
- Maybe there's a list.
- A list. How silly of me.

270
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,599
Of course there's a list.

271
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,159
Careful, Dad!

272
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,915
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay!
- Look! You're flying!

273
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,560
It's okay. I'm used to it.
I lived through the '60s.

274
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

275
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,917
Nice teeth.

276
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,830
Who's down there?

277
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,918
It's the holidays.
Come on. Come on.

278
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,269
Charlie, I need
a little help down here!

279
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,478
Whoa! How'd you do that?
What'd it feel like, Dad?

280
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,597
It felt like
<i>America's Most Wanted.</i>

281
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,798
Now, pull me in, quick.
We gotta get outta here.

282
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,792
Thanks. We gotta go home.
How do you start this thing?

283
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,832
Just like that!

284
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,478
Whoa!

285
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,830
This could be
a really long night.

286
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,873
Do it again, Dad. Please.

287
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,077
I can't. That thing's empty.

288
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,228
There's nothin' in the bag.

289
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,953
Even if there was, d-didn't
you notice there's no chimney?

290
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,355
Where there's no chimney,
there's no fireplace.

291
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,397
Are you growling at me?

292
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,315
Look, Comet, like I said,

293
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,358
there is nothing left...

294
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,637
That's so weird, 'cause
I know when I did... that...

295
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,353
No, no, no, no, no!
Hold it!

296
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,035
There's no chimney here. Can you
hear me? No chimney, all right?

297
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,640
Lookin' good, Dad.

298
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,518
You have got to be kidding!
Come on!

299
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,114
Look at the size
of this thing.

300
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,916
Weird! Ow!

301
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,039
Ouch! Oh!

302
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,833
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.

303
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,559
How come your clothes
are so baggy?

304
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,191
Because Santa is watchin'
his saturated fats.

305
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,671
- How come you don't have a beard?
- Because I shaved!

306
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,998
Do you want this doll or not?
Go back to sleep.

307
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,430
You're supposed
to drink the milk.

308
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,080
Look, I am
lactose intolerant.

309
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,870
And I am just about this close
to taking all those presents
back up the chimney with me.

310
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,234
"Supposed to drink the milk."

311
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,313
Shut your eyes.

312
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,915
Yo!

313
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,151
How do you get in
without a fireplace?

314
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,589
I don't know.
One just kind of appeared.

315
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,473
Awesome!

316
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,830
Oh, boy!

317
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,789
Charlie, look at the clouds over here.
Aren't they pret...

318
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,836
Charlie!

319
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,553
All right.
Mornin', fellas.

320
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,155
Mornin', sport.
We're done, Comet. Ho-ho-ho.

321
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,270
Back to the house.

322
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,670
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night.

323
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,558
When I wake up,
I'm gettin' a CAT scan!

324
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,911
- Is this okay, Dad?
- No, it's not okay!

325
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,112
Hey, does this look like home
to you guys?

326
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,960
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey!

327
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,350
Where you goin'?
Come back here! Aww!

328
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,150
<i>In the silence of the night</i>

329
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,708
- <i>When the snow</i>
- Hey, hey!

330
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,399
- <i>Lies soft and still</i>
- Hey, buddy!

331
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,991
- You, sir! Hey!
- <i>You can see a magic light</i>

332
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,232
<i>And hear the ring</i>
<i>of Christmas bells</i>

333
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,917
- Can you hear me?
- <i>Though the night seems long and dark</i>

334
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,753
- <i>It is the earth</i>
- What's that?

335
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,876
- <i>Just gone to sleep</i>
- I don't know.

336
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,394
- I think it's the North Pole.
- <i>The stars that dot</i>

337
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,596
- That's the North Pole?
- <i>The sky above</i>

338
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,074
- Hey, buddy, we need some help.
- <i>Hold you in</i>

339
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,469
- Hello!
- <i>Their precious keep</i>

340
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:02,873
- What are you doing?
- <i>So close your eyes and come with me</i>

341
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,190
<i>The Christmas bells</i>
<i>will bring you home</i>

342
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,794
Hey, look!
Here comes the new Santa!

343
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,071
<i>And now with song</i>
<i>we fill the night</i>

344
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,232
<i>While magic dances</i>
<i>in the light</i>

345
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,392
<i>To wish you now</i>
<i>and all the year</i>

346
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,710
<i>Thejoy that comes</i>
<i>with Christmas cheer</i>

347
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,509
- Sit back.
- <i>Hear our voices fill the air</i>

348
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,717
<i>To drive the</i>
<i>winter's cold away</i>

349
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,917
<i>And so our hearts</i>
<i>with all will share</i>

350
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,072
<i>The love that comes</i>
<i>with Christmas day</i>

351
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,317
<i>The love that comes</i>
<i>with Christmas day</i>

352
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,758
<i>The Christmas bells</i>
<i>will bring you home</i>

353
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,589
- Where are all the grown-ups?
- This is so cool.

354
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,517
Stay here.

355
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,916
Hey, kid, kid.
Kid, who's in charge here?

356
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,357
You are. And I'm not a kid. I've
pointy shoes that are older than you.

357
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,271
I'm an elf.

358
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,796
Uh, you guys, or you girls...
Who gives the orders? Who's your boss?

359
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,711
- You are.
- No, no, no. Uh...

360
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,950
- W-Who's the head elf?
- You are.

361
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,355
Hey! Who's causin' all
the trouble around here?

362
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,793
- He is.
- She is.

363
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,070
Excuse me. Are we
on a coffee break?

364
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,550
- We don't drink coffee.
- Then I guess the break is over!

365
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,909
Back to work. Thanks.

366
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,679
Take it easy on her, will ya?
Who are you?

367
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,712
I'm Bernard.
Nice to meet ya, Santa.

368
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,151
I'm not Santa! I've had a rough night.
There's been dogs barkin',
guns goin' off.

369
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,397
Look, my back's killin' me.
Have you ever tried to shove
a sea kayak down a chimney?

370
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,789
- I'm tired of this small talk.
- Hmm.

371
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,833
The other Santa
disappeared, right?

372
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,469
Wait a minute.
Hey, I know where this is goin'.

373
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,432
It wasn't my fault.
The other guy fell. It was an accident.

374
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,512
I've got homeowner's insurance
and a good attorney.

375
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,518
Not as good as my wife's,
but let's not open up that wound.

376
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,478
Hold it a minute.
Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

377
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,556
How did you know
the other guy was gone?

378
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,108
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I don't want a drink.

379
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,555
I'm thirsty and hungry too.

380
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,074
Charlie, I thought I told you
to stay in the sleigh.

381
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,398
- Who's this?
- This... This is my son, Charlie.

382
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,556
I'm sorry. Charlie,
this is Buh, Beh, Beh...

383
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,153
- Bernard.
- Bernard.

384
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,073
- Hi, Bernard.
- Hiya, sport.

385
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,078
- Hey, Dad, he called me "sport"
just like you.
- Wonderful.

386
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,720
Hey, you know what.
I got somethin' for you.

387
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,758
Okay, now hold out
your hand, all right?

388
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,918
Now, be very careful.
This is very old, just like me.

389
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,428
Shake it up, Charlie.

390
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,113
Wow.

391
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,668
Why don't you, uh, hold onto it
for me for a while.

392
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:22,392
- It might come in handy.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

393
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,914
I promise I'll take
real good care of it.

394
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,988
- Make sure you do.
- I will.

395
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,838
Hey, Dad, look!

396
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,309
Huh. Fabulous ball.

397
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,709
- Hey, Barabbas.
- Bernard!

398
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,112
Bernard. Can we take a direct
flight back to reality, or do we
have to change planes in Denver?

399
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,111
Uh, Larry, take Charlie here
and get him some chow.

400
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,435
- No, Larry, don't do that. Charlie!
- He'll be okay.

401
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,351
Follow me. You'll want to
get out of those clothes.

402
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,432
I... Uh... No, look, Barnaby,
I just wanna go home.

403
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,515
Look, I am not Santa Claus!
Ahh!

404
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,591
Did you or did you not
read the card?

405
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,955
- Yeah, I read the card.
- Then you're the new Santa.

406
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,355
In putting on the hat and jacket
you accepted the contract.

407
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,513
- What contract?
- The card in the Santa suit.
You said you read it, right?

408
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,398
So when you put on the suit,
you fell subject to the Santa Clause.

409
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,993
- Here.
- The Santa Claus?

410
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,071
Oh, you mean the guy
that fell off my roof?

411
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,430
No, no, no, not Santa Claus, the person.
Santa Clause, the clause.

412
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,550
What?

413
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,358
- Look, you're...
you're a businessman, right?
- Yeah.

414
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,955
Okay. A clause,
as in the last line of a contract.

415
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,155
- You got the card?
- Oh!

416
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,390
Okay, look.

417
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,392
The Santa Clause:
"In putting on this suit
and entering the sleigh...

418
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,995
"the wearer waives any and all rights to
any previous identity, real or implied,

419
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,277
"and fully accepts the duties
and responsibilities of Santa Claus...

420
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,114
"in perpetuity until such time
that wearer becomes unable to do so...

421
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,589
by either accident or design."

422
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,752
- What does that mean?
- It means you put on the suit,
you're the big guy.

423
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,071
- That's ridiculous.
I didn't put on the suit just to...
- Try to understand this!

424
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,993
Oo-oo-ooh!

425
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,196
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

426
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,199
Toys have to be delivered. I'm not gonna
do it. It's not my job. I'm just an elf.

427
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,391
It's Santa's job, but Santa
fell off a roof, your roof.

428
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,796
You read the card, you put on the suit.
That clearly falls under
the Santa Clause.

429
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,030
- So now you're Santa, okay?
- A question.

430
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,758
- What?
- When can I get outta here?

431
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,150
- Dad, you gotta see this place.
- You leave tomorrow morning.

432
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,676
You have 11 months
to get your affairs in order,
and you're due back here Thanksgiving.

433
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,309
- I'm not comin' back here
on Thanksgiving.
- I'll ship the list to your house.

434
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,352
- What list?
- Come on, now. The list.

435
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,591
<i>- He's makin'a list</i>
<i>- Checkin'it twice</i>

436
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,673
<i>Gonna find out</i>
<i>who's naughty or nice</i>

437
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,076
Look, you put a "P"
next to the kids who are nice
and a "C" next to the naughty ones.

438
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,312
- "P" and "C"?
- Yeah. "P" for present,
"C" for coal, right, Bernard?

439
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,960
- Right.
- Wait a minute.
How do I know who's good and bad?

440
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,675
- You'll know.
- What if I don't want to do this?

441
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,274
- Don't even kid about a thing like that.
- Why not?

442
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,229
What if I don't
buy into this Santa Clause thing?
What if I choose not to believe it?

443
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,911
Then there would be millions of
disappointed children around the world.

444
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,152
You see, children hold the spirit
of Christmas within their hearts.

445
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,837
You wouldn't want to be responsible
for killing the spirit of Christmas,

446
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,878
now, would you, Santa?

447
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,749
Judy will take you to your room. Get out
of the suit. It needs to be cleaned.

448
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,189
- And taken in.
- Then get some sleep.

449
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,477
We've got a lot of work to do
and only a year in which to do it.

450
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,073
- Judy.
- Santa.

451
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,875
- Scott Calvin.
- Follow me.

452
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,912
- I'll just take the next train.
- Dad, come on!

453
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,872
Charlie!

454
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,872
- Come on, Dad!
- Charlie, wait up!

455
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,917
- That's funny. I like that.
- I like that too. But I don't like...

456
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,114
Wow!

457
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,195
Can I get you anything?
The kitchen's always open.

458
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,117
How about a stiff drink?

459
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,876
You should get some sleep.

460
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,672
Here are your pyjamas.
I'll be right back.

461
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,391
Oh, oh, look, Judy.
Look. Look over there.

462
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,238
There's a...

463
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,113
Look. Look over there.
I know.

464
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,915
Look. Look over there.
There's a canoe. Aha, it's true.

465
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,911
Oh, look, there's an emu.

466
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,190
- Look at him.
- Shoo.

467
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,994
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.

468
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,835
- I brought you some cocoa.
- No, thanks.

469
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,993
My own recipe. Took me
1200 years to get it right.

470
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,117
- 1200 years?
- That's right.

471
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,718
You know, I must say, you look
pretty good for your age.

472
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,712
Thanks, but I'm seeing
someone in wrapping.

473
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,594
This is good.

474
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,511
This is really good.

475
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,515
Not too hot, extra chocolate,
shaken, not stirred.

476
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,510
You look distressed.

477
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,068
Distressed?
I'm way past distressed.

478
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,312
- Why's that?
- I'm talking to an elf.

479
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,749
And I stopped believing
in Santa Claus a long time ago.

480
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,628
That's not surprising.
Most grown-ups can't believe in magic.

481
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,713
It just... sort of
grows out of them.

482
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,678
Look, you're
a nice little elf.

483
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,069
- Thanks.
- But this is a dream.

484
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,071
I mean, this is fabulous.

485
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,596
Is that a polar bear
directin' traffic down there?

486
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,236
I... I see it,
but I don't believe it.

487
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,113
- You're missing the point.
- What is the point?

488
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,839
Seeing isn't believing;
believing is seeing.

489
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,668
Kids don't have to see this place
to know that it's here.

490
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,598
They just... know.

491
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,599
Well, you should get some rest.
Good night, sir.

492
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,959
Dad!

493
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,678
Dad!

494
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,950
Wake up, sleepy!

495
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,871
Come on, get up!

496
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,630
Dad!

497
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,557
Dad!

498
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,239
Dad!

499
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,477
Come on, Dad! Come on!

500
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,437
You should see
all the neat toys.

501
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,636
- Stop shakin' me, Charlie.
- Come on. Get up. Get up!

502
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,029
- Okay!
- Come on. It's Christmas morning.

503
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,192
- Great! G-Go and make some coffee.
- Come on, Dad. Let's go!

504
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,310
Okay. Okay.

505
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,197
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah. Just fine. Just fine.

506
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,078
Are you having a heart attack?
I know CPR.

507
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,991
No, I was just...

508
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,511
- S. C?
- Yeah, Santa Claus.

509
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,394
Hey. Same initials
as your name, Dad.

510
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,954
Scott Calvin.

511
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,349
What?

512
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,076
Oh, Charlie! Oh,
merry Christmas, honey!

513
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,918
- Did you have a good time?
- Great time! The best!

514
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,636
Great... Oh, ho, Scott.
Nice P.J.s. Very festive.

515
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,030
- Where'd you get them?
- I don't know.

516
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,590
- Judy gave them to you.
- Judy. Really.

517
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,551
- Who?
- Up in the North Pole.

518
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,790
Ah, one of Santa's
little helpers.

519
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,753
Last night, Dad and me
went with the flying reindeer.

520
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,749
It was really neat, Mom. Dad was Santa,
and Larry showed me the workshop.

521
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,473
- You know, where they make all the toys?
- Gee, thanks for...

522
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,353
- keeping his feet on the ground.
- You bet.

523
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,871
Honey, you go wait in the car
for a minute, okay? I'll be right there.

524
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,191
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye, Dad. Thanks for a great night
at the North Pole.

525
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,795
So, uh, what have you
been telling him?

526
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,715
Nothing. It's just...
I had this really strange dream.

527
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,275
And I... I must have
told him all about it.

528
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,476
Wait!

529
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,151
- Charlie.
- Scott.
- Hi, Dad.

530
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,431
- Nice jammies.
- Thanks. About what you said
in the house.

531
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,351
- Who showed you the workshop?
- The elf.

532
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,512
- How'd I get the pyjamas?
- I told you. Judy.

533
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,594
Oh, wait. Wait. Judy was the name of the
waitress at the restaurant last night.

534
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,189
- Some waitress gave you pyjamas?
- What's this all about?

535
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,317
Dad took me to the North Pole,
and Larry showed me the workshop.

536
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,188
- The North Pole.
- Yeah. Dad's the new Santa.

537
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,113
The regular Santa fell off the roof,
and Dad put on the suit.

538
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,158
Charlie, we'll discuss this at home.

539
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,792
The clause.
The Santa Clause.

540
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,991
It's just a dream.
Stuff like that doesn't happen.

541
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,834
It was a dream. Come on!

542
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,998
I don't even wear pyjamas!
Normally I sleep naked. Buck naked.

543
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,196
Ha! Morning, Mrs McGloin.
Mary Catherine.

544
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,117
Eyes front,
Mary Catherine.

545
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,469
Sometimes boxer shorts.
You know.

546
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:27,033
So, remember, kids, there is nothing
more painful than third degree burns.

547
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,071
Well, thank you,
Fireman O'Hara.

548
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,197
And I think the whole class
will join me in saying...

549
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,111
sorry about your partner.

550
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,949
Well, perhaps this is a good time
to bring up the psychiatrist.

551
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,238
Charlie, would you like
to introduce your, um...

552
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,595
Dr Miller?

553
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,274
Can I ask Dad to go first?

554
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,039
Well, if that's how
you feel, Charlie.

555
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,272
That's how he feels, Neal.
Come on. Nice sweater, buddy.

556
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,794
This is my dad, Scott Calvin.
He's got a really neat job.

557
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,270
- Thank you, Charlie.
- My dad is Santa Claus.

558
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,908
Oh, boy! I think what he means is,
I'm like Santa Claus.

559
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,197
We're both giving.
We're both jolly.

560
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,028
And we both work very hard
one day a year.

561
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,351
- Oh, boy.
- That's not what I mean, Dad.

562
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,597
Look, on Christmas Eve,
my dad pushed Santa off the roof.

563
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,433
- No, Charlie... Ch... Charlie.
- Santa disappeared
and my dad took his place.

564
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,677
- Charlie!
- Then I went with him
to deliver all the presents.

565
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,439
Then the reindeer flew us to the
North Pole where the head elf,

566
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,751
- Charlie.
- Bernard, gave me this.

567
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,952
Look, I work for a toy company.
I deliver toys all over the country.

568
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,158
So, in a way,
I'm like Santa Claus.

569
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,834
- Yes, sweetheart?
- Do you make the toys?

570
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,195
No, stupid, the elves do!

571
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,798
Bobby, we don't say "stupid,"
and we don't say "elves."
They're little people.

572
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,674
- No, but they really are elves.
- Whatever, honey.

573
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,036
- Which one's your favourite reindeer?
- Comet.

574
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,839
Uh, I, I, I don't have a favourite.

575
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,599
So, let me get this
straight, Santa.

576
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,592
You mean, when I grow up,
if I wanna be Santa Claus,

577
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,756
all I gotta do is
push you off a roof?

578
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,274
All right, he said that. He said that
it was the best Christmas he ever had.

579
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,073
- Oh, big surprise. What do you think?
- It's just nice to hear it from him.

580
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,914
- Is that a problem with you?
- That's my responsibility, isn't it?
- All right. So?

581
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,037
May I speak, please?
I am a doctor.

582
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,680
No, he's not.
He's a psychiatrist.

583
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,399
Please. Go ahead, Dr Miller.

584
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,914
I guess we know
who's the teacher's pet.

585
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,355
Scott! Oh, grow up.

586
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,716
The reason we're here is that
this is far more serious...

587
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,837
than a boy believing
or not believing in Santa Claus.

588
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,475
That's right, because Charlie thinks
that this whole thing actually happened.

589
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,354
Scott, what was the last thing
you and Charlie did...

590
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,550
before you went to bed
Christmas Eve?

591
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,275
We shared a bowl of sugar;
did some shots of brown liquor;

592
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,999
played with my shotguns;
field dressed a cat;

593
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,554
looked for women.

594
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,473
- I read him a book.
- What book?

595
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,516
Uh, <i>Hollywood Wives.</i>

596
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,795
<i>The Night Before Christmas,</i> folks.
Come on!

597
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,115
And did you
go to the North Pole?

598
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,031
T-This is ridiculous.
I don't have time for this.

599
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,352
Ridiculous or not, Scott,
for Charlie, this isn't some dream.

600
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,032
It is real.

601
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,509
You need to sit down
with Charlie. Explain to him...

602
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,597
you are not Santa Claus.

603
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,592
They're like the bears
at the North Pole, Dad.

604
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,275
Charlie, I already told ya.
We did not go to the North Pole.

605
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,669
- That was a dream.
- You're in denial, Dad.

606
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,597
Denial. You don't
even know what that means.

607
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,797
Well, you are.
I know what happened.

608
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,118
How do you know that?
How? You don't have any proof.

609
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,113
- Proof?
- Why can't we both think of it as just
a great dream and forget about it?

610
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,829
What about this? Remember
all the neat stuff inside?

611
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,833
Charlie, this is a toy.

612
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,549
We used to make things like this
at work, but no one bought 'em.

613
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,315
Here. I don't wanna
talk about this any more.

614
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,359
I know who you are, Dad.
You'll figure it out soon enough.

615
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,991
There are a lot of kids that believe
in you. You can't let them down.

616
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,355
Charlie, you're wrong.

617
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,838
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

618
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,988
<i>He sees you</i>
<i>when you're sleeping</i>

619
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,640
<i>He knows when you're awake</i>

620
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,314
<i>He knows if you've</i>
<i>been bad or good</i>

621
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,316
<i>Rollin'</i>
<i>Keep those reindeer rollin'</i>

622
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,870
<i>Okay, you better watch out</i>
<i>You better not cry</i>

623
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,520
<i>- You better not pout I'm tellin' you why</i>
- Come on, Dancer. Come on, Prancer.

624
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,949
- <i>Santa Claus is coming</i>
- Whoa! We can't stop.

625
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,793
- <i>To town</i>
- But I have to go to the bathroom.

626
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,316
I told you, you should've gone
before we left the North Pole.

627
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,033
<i>And rummy tum-tums</i>

628
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,398
Whoa! Right here.
Turn over here.

629
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,835
<i>Curly-haired dolls</i>
<i>that toddle and coo</i>

630
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,480
<i>Elephant spokes</i>
<i>and kiddie cars too</i>

631
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,398
- Where is he?
- Well, he could be in his room,

632
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,517
jumping up and down on his bed
wearing a red hat and galoshes.

633
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,034
I don't care what Neal's doing.
Where's Charlie?

634
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,554
Oh, ho, ho.
Oh, I see, I see.

635
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,478
Well, if you can't be father of the
year, why not be Father Christmas, huh?

636
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,313
Charlie,
it's just not logical.

637
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,638
How can one man
in one night...

638
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,557
visit all the children
of the world?

639
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,551
Not everyone
celebrates Christmas.

640
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,760
And I think there's some sort
of time continuum that breaks down
once Santa's in his sleigh.

641
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,352
What about fireplaces?
A lot of people don't have them.

642
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,749
How does Santa
visit those people?

643
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,479
He turns into Jell-O and...

644
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,069
The fireplace kind of appears,
and he goes through it like this.

645
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,278
What about the reindeer?

646
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,791
- Have you ever seen a reindeer fly?
- Yes.

647
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,628
- Well, I haven't.
- Have you ever seen a million dollars?

648
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,591
No!

649
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,719
Just because you haven't seen it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

650
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,069
Hey, Neal.
Howdy, sport.

651
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,509
- Hi, Dad.
- You wanna take a walk?
I wanna talk to you.

652
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,791
- Sure. I'll get my coat.
- Okay. Hustle up.

653
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,792
Scott? Can I have a minute?

654
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,519
Sure.

655
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,115
I think Charlie is conflicted
at the moment.

656
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,628
Wow. Really?

657
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,679
Boy. Hmm. Appreciate
your analysis. I really do.

658
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,429
But, boy, you got more important things
to worry about, you know.

659
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,877
Like, where are you gonna
get more sweaters after
the circus pulls outta town?

660
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,435
Scott! I mean,
you're not listening.

661
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,829
We are very concerned about this.

662
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,115
Concerned about what?

663
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,792
This...

664
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,838
If Charlie spending time with you
is the best thing for him.

665
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,638
You were right
about the sweater, okay?

666
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,152
Do you think by next year
I'll be big enough to drive
the sleigh all by myself?

667
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,198
- No!
- But I've been practising.

668
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,555
No, that's not what I'm talkin' about.
Charlie, hold on a second.

669
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,672
We've got to talk about
this Santa Claus thing.

670
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,710
Charlie, there...
there is no...

671
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,235
No what, Dad?

672
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,909
There's no reason why we have to
tell anybody about the North Pole.

673
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,988
- Why not?
- Well, sometimes some things,
big things,

674
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,670
should remain un... unsaid,
like between two people...

675
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,510
- Oh, you mean like a secret.
- Yes. Like a secret.
Let's keep it a secret.

676
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,273
How come?

677
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,352
Because of Mom and Neal.

678
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,039
Not just because of them.
There's school.

679
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,839
Everybody thinks... Well,
it's not important what they think.

680
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,992
It...

681
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,396
How does five bucks sound to ya?

682
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,473
This is something I really
want you to do for me, sport.

683
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,350
I want to keep this secret.
Will ya do that, please?

684
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,557
- Okay, Dad.
- All right.

685
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,068
Great.

686
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,636
You don't have to worry about
the Santa Claus thing any more.

687
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,109
So when do I get the five bucks?

688
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,516
<i>... 15 in the morning.</i>
<i>It's gonna be a beautiful day.</i>

689
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,877
<i>Spend the day with me,</i>
<i>Larry B.</i>

690
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,357
Huh?

691
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,112
Something's wrong with the mirror.

692
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,270
What? Something's wrong
with the scale.

693
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,911
Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh...

694
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,391
Hmm. I'll have a field green
salad and... Oh, my God.

695
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,069
- What the...
- What? Scott?

696
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,989
Calvin?

697
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,951
Sorry, um, the dry cleaner
in my neighbourhood went up in smoke.

698
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,476
Some big chemical fire.
All my clothes, poof, gone.

699
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,836
God. Your... Your weight.

700
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,832
What happened?

701
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,674
Bee sting.
Evidently I'm allergic.

702
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,799
Almost killed me. But the guy
at the emergency room says...

703
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,155
the swelling will go down.

704
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,715
I hope. So,
did I miss anything?

705
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,916
No, we were, uh,
just about to order lunch.

706
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,916
Great! I'm starving.

707
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,675
I'll have a salad and iced tea
and dressing on the side.

708
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,793
Uh, pasta and tomatoes, uh, and
very light on the oil. Can you do that?

709
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,792
And I'll have a Caesar.
No dressing.

710
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,314
And one of those home-made cookies,
the warm chocolate chip. No nuts.

711
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,039
And, uh, a little slice of cheesecake.
Uh, creme brulee...

712
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,437
and, um, hot fudge sundae,
extra hot fudge.

713
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,356
On the side.

714
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,712
- Anything to drink?
- Ice-cold milk.

715
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,237
- Stung by a bee, Scott?
- A big bee.

716
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,153
Finished?

717
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,197
Okay, now, remember.
This is just a storyboard.

718
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,317
But here is
our preliminary...

719
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,113
Total Tank TV spot.

720
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,714
Okay, now, we've got Santa.
He's up in the North Pole.

721
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,634
He's gettin' ready
for... Christmas!

722
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,076
- Oh, no.
- Problem?

723
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,596
It's just a little thing.
The elves.

724
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,990
- What about the elves?
- They look so funny.

725
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,350
They're supposed to look funny.
They're elves.

726
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,756
Just my opinion.
Can't they look a little younger...

727
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,354
with silver specks
on their cheeks?

728
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,512
- Can we continue here?
- Okay.

729
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,632
Now, this year Santa's
not goin' out in a sleigh.

730
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,759
This time he's goin'
Total Tank.

731
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,549
Wait a minute! No way! No way Santa's
goin' anywhere without his sleigh.

732
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,029
He would if he's tryin'
to sell the Total Tank.

733
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,315
Well, isn't that a pretty picture.

734
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,874
Santa's rollin' down the block
in a panzer.

735
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,071
Well, kids, I... I certainly hope
you've been good this year.

736
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,680
'Cause it looks like Santa
just took out the Pearson home.

737
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,352
- Incoming!
- Oh, please.

738
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,874
And another thing.
What about the reindeer?

739
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,509
Reindeer and Santa. Santa and reindeer.
I-It's kind of a package deal.

740
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,512
- Calvin.
- You don't believe in Santa, do ya?

741
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,358
Calvin, can we get
back to the presentation?

742
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,476
I'm not done yet.
Since we've opened this box,

743
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,909
have any of you tried
to build the Total Tank?

744
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,919
It's got 10,000 parts,
and even if you do get it together,
it breaks ten minutes later.

745
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,758
- Then you gotta spend more
money just to buy new parts.
- I thought that was the whole point.

746
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,711
No, no, no, no.

747
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,197
What we gotta do is develop
a, a basic, simple, inexpensive toy...

748
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,595
that will nurture
a child's creative thinking.

749
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,916
- Calvin...
- Here, try the brown ones.

750
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,871
Can I see you outside a minute?

751
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,350
I don't know
what's happening to you.

752
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,278
You're starting to look like
the Pillsbury dough boy.

753
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,478
- Y-You're falling apart.
- I know! I know.

754
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,120
- I don't know what came over me.
- W-Well, just get some help.

755
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,278
You know, y-you should s-see a doctor,
a shrink, a dietician, anything.

756
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,909
Just get some help.

757
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,037
Okay, Scott. Time is up.

758
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,709
- Let's get over here
and check your pulse.
- All right.

759
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,193
Okay, hmm?

760
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,470
Huh? Well, nuts. I...

761
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,120
Oh, no, uh,
your pulse is great. I...

762
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,668
Well, I-I don't know, Scott.
Y-You're as healthy as a horse.

763
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,274
Yeah, Clydesdale.

764
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,591
Okay, look. So, what?
You put on a little weight.

765
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,915
A little weight? Does this
look like a little weight to you?

766
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,117
Well, weight can fluctuate
from year to year.

767
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,317
Fluctuate? You make it
sound like I'm retainin' water.

768
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,359
I've gained 45 pounds in a week.
Pete, what's happenin' to me?

769
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,198
- Well, what's your diet like?
- Milk and cookies.

770
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,236
- Really?
- But I don't finish all the milk.

771
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,713
Well, then, there is your problem. Just
try to cut back on the sweets, okay?

772
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,519
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

773
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,074
How fast does hair grow?
Facial hair?

774
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,712
- What?
- I shave in the morning
and in the afternoon I look like this.

775
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,157
Well, it could be
a hormonal imbalance.

776
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,033
- That would explain the mood swings.
- Mood swings?

777
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,514
- Yeah, well, look at my hair.
It's turnin' grey.
- Oh, it's middle age, buddy.

778
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:07,071
It happens. And with that body,
you should be thankful you have hair.

779
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,430
Look, i-if it bothers you,
you can dye it, and you should diet!

780
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,077
Ah, just kidding.
Okay, up with the shirt.

781
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,079
Let's take a listen
to the old ticker. Whoa. Okay.

782
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,991
Ooh, it's cold.

783
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,517
Over here, Steve!
I'm open!

784
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,271
What?

785
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,997
I want some ballet slippers.

786
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,709
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

787
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,030
- Hold on now.
- Wait a minute. Wait, I'm not done.

788
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,954
Fax me. Hi. Hey, this probably
looks pretty odd, doesn't it?

789
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,350
- These kids lined up all by themselves.
- Scott,

790
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,434
I think it's safe to say you're taking
this Santa thing to an unhealthy level.

791
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,029
Here's my card.
Call me.

792
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,874
Scott, I... I really have to tell you
that this is beginning to scare me.

793
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,475
I never in my wildest...
Well, no, okay, maybe my wildest...

794
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,239
But certainly never in
my normal dreams would I...

795
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,039
- But then this is Scott
we're talking about and I...
- Laura, the point.

796
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,197
It's just I never thought
you would stoop to changing
your physical appearance...

797
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,840
in order to make
Charlie like you.

798
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,515
- Do you have any concept of how
dangerous this is to a little boy?
- Whoa.

799
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,120
- Whoa, whoa. "How dangerous"?
- Mom, what's the matter?

800
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,237
- Come on, Charlie, we're going home.
- But we just started.

801
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,157
Well, a...
You let him stay. I'll go.

802
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,237
If you don't get your act together,
Scott, so help me...

803
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,552
- Watch it, folks.
- I will just... Oh!
- Mom!
- Come on. Move it, lady!

804
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,909
Kick it!

805
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,557
- Hi there.
- Hi. I got a delivery for S.C.

806
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,511
- You S. C?
- Scott Calvin, that's me.

807
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,034
Sign here, please.

808
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,788
- All right.
- Thanks. I'll get your packages.

809
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,836
- Packages?
- Yeah, there's quite a few of them.

810
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,151
Great. I'll leave the door open.
Just leave them inside here.

811
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,953
Will do.

812
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,830
It's the list.

813
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,839
"Armand Assante"?

814
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,474
Yo!

815
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,438
Hold it! Hold... Oh!
Hold it!

816
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:54,229
- You! You! Take that! Come on! Come on!
- Stay away from the truck.

817
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,159
What am I supposed to do with
all these packages, guys? Come on.

818
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,271
Aah.

819
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,154
You know, I knew it. I knew that... that
something was going on. I just... I...

820
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,875
What I can't believe is that he would
go behind our backs all this time,

821
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,999
confusing Charlie again just...

822
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:20,431
I... I... What are we...
What are we supposed to do?

823
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,478
Well, there's one
obvious alternative.

824
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,637
Okay.

825
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,551
Aah.

826
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,998
- Annie, nice.
- Beep!

827
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,838
- Johnny, naughty.
- Johnny, wait up.

828
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,474
Gary, nice.

829
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,835
Veronica, very nice.

830
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,075
In your dreams, sleigh boy.

831
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,879
Huh?

832
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,429
I'm in big trouble.
Mm-hmm.

833
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,318
Thank you.

834
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,798
Judge Wayland's office.

835
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,997
Charlie, do you mind
if I talk to you for a minute?

836
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,674
It's okay, honey. Come on.

837
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,840
We won't be long.

838
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,111
Are we doing
the right thing, Neal?

839
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,430
- Something needs to shake Scott.
- Yeah, but...

840
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,313
But to... to take away
his visitation rights.

841
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,198
Honey, the man is delusional.

842
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,358
Okay, okay, so maybe I'm having
second thoughts, kind of. I just...

843
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,671
I mean, what was so bad about
Charlie believing in Santa?

844
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,711
Well, he's a little old.

845
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,034
Oh, come on, Laura.
Don't you remember when you
stopped believing in Santa Claus?

846
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:08,193
I was Charlie's age,
I guess, I...

847
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,630
I wrote Santa a letter
every week that year.

848
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,111
Well, you know, okay,
you know, maybe...

849
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,720
Maybe not every week, but...

850
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,273
Boy, I really wanted
a "Mystery Date" game.

851
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,073
Do you remember those?

852
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,152
No. Of course you don't.

853
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,629
You know, no one does.

854
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,678
I... I don't even think
they make them any more, but...

855
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,035
Well, anyway...

856
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,351
Christmas morning came and...

857
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,039
Oh, I got dozens of presents.

858
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,038
Oh, I got everything.

859
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,636
Except "Mystery Date."

860
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,554
I was three, and it was
an Oscar Meyer wienie whistle.

861
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,156
Christmas came.
No wienie whistle.

862
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,477
And that's when
I stopped believing.

863
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,636
You were three?

864
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,228
Yeah.

865
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,794
Oh, Neal.

866
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,398
- Where's Charlie? I want to talk to him.
- He's with the judge.

867
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,556
Dad!

868
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:37,278
It's all okay.
I told the judge everything...

869
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,880
about you and the North Pole.

870
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,394
After reviewing all
of your testimonies,

871
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,352
I've come to a very
difficult decision.

872
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,876
I'm sorry to do this in light
of the holiday season,

873
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,999
but in the best interest
of the child,

874
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,789
I'm granting the petition
of Dr and Mrs Miller.

875
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,269
Mr Calvin, as of today,

876
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,238
all of your visitation rights
are suspended...

877
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:07,029
pending a hearing
after the first of the year.

878
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,991
- Hey, Neal.
- Scott.

879
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,755
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Don't make me beat you up, Neal.

880
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,473
Oh, would Santa
really beat someone up?

881
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,990
- I'm this close.
- So you still believe you're Santa?

882
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,713
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

883
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,236
Of course you are, Dad.
How can you say that?

884
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,068
- Think of all those kids.
- The only kid I'm thinkin' about is you.

885
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,755
Dad, I'm fine.
You can't let them down.

886
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,758
- They all believe in you!
- Charlie, listen.

887
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,833
You listen!
You think you know who he is. You don't!

888
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,031
Charlie. Honey, listen.
You're confused.

889
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,957
I know exactly who he is.

890
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,355
Charlie, he's not Santa!

891
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,473
He is too, Santa!
We went to the North Pole together.

892
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,638
I saw it. The elves are real old
even though they look like me.

893
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,355
Bernard called me sport,
'cause he knew everything.

894
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,630
Right, Dad?

895
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,234
Remember!

896
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,355
Thank you, Charlie.
Thank you.

897
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,555
I love you, Dad.

898
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,033
Could you guys leave us
alone for a minute?

899
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,993
I mean, so I can
say goodbye to him properly?

900
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,392
You saw!
You saw the ball come to life.

901
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,795
You bet I did.

902
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,196
- Well, Charlie, I guess I... I better go.
- I'll get my stuff.

903
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,397
Well, wait, sport. Sport. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

904
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,558
I think it's a much better idea
if you just stayed here with your mom.

905
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,319
I wanna be with you, Dad.

906
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,595
Boy, I love hearing you say that.

907
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,989
You mean I can go?

908
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,836
Boy, this bird is dry. Haven't
you people heard about basting?

909
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,718
Bernard!

910
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,634
- Hiya, sport.
- Bernard, can I go?
Please, can I go, Bernard?

911
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,029
It's okay with me.

912
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,351
Charlie, if, uh...

913
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,197
Charlie?

914
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,717
Scott!

915
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,116
Charlie!

916
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,995
This is our perpetrator.

917
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,918
Scott Calvin, 38 years old.

918
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,474
Believes himself
to be Santa Claus.

919
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,990
Ladies and gentlemen,
this one's not gonna be easy to find.

920
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,474
Uh, won't the bright red suit
and beard give him away?

921
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,596
Charlie's got some great ideas
on how to keep you safe.

922
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,035
Santa, this is Quintin,
head of research and development.

923
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,469
- Quintin, good to meet ya.
- Hello, Santa.

924
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:58,399
Charlie and I have put our heads
together, and I think we've got
a few surprises for you.

925
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,950
This is some of the best stuff that's
come out of the workshop since the ball.

926
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,195
Fabulous.
What happens if I fall off the roof?

927
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,199
Is this the most
current photo you have?

928
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,117
Hold on.

929
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,833
- Hello?
- <i>Mom.</i>
- Oh, Charlie. Oh, my God.

930
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:22,515
Honey, how are you? Are you...
Are... Where are you? Are you okay?

931
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,592
<i>I'm fine.</i>
<i>We're up at the North Pole.</i>

932
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,148
Charlie, are you sure you're okay?

933
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:31,437
<i>I'm terrific! I'm helping</i>
<i>the elves build a new sleigh.</i>

934
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:34,995
<i>We're trying for a vertical takeoff.</i>
<i>Well, gotta go. The elves need me.</i>

935
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,469
- No, Charlie, wait. No, don't
hang up the phone, honey.
- <i>Don't worry, Mom. Everything's fine.</i>

936
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,717
- <i>See you at Christmas.</i>
- Charlie, don't... Ah.

937
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,752
Fireplaces will no longer be a problem.

938
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,389
It's a new fabric.
Completely flame retardant.

939
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,116
- It's light, yet durable.
- And you can wear the jumpsuit
under your coat and pants.

940
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,715
But what do I do
if I fall off a roof?

941
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:05,629
We'll cordon off a three-block radius
around Dr Miller's house.

942
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,353
Now, Calvin is to be
apprehended unharmed.

943
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,393
And remember, he'll probably
be dressed like Santa Claus.

944
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,749
<i>Give it your best shot</i>

945
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,519
<i>'Cause what you got is</i>
<i>oh, so sweet</i>

946
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,590
- Freeze!
- What the...

947
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:48,832
<i>I need a routine</i>
<i>So gimme all your lovin'</i>

948
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,668
- It's not even my suit. It's a rental.
- <i>All your hugs and kisses too</i>

949
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:59,756
<i>Gimme all your lovin'</i>
<i>Don't let up until we're through</i>

950
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,509
"From Comet, To Santa."
Did you make the card?

951
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,835
It's a nice rope.
Just in case I fall off the roof?

952
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,557
Comet, this means a lot to me.
Thanks, buddy.

953
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,676
<i>And if I blow my top</i>

954
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,914
<i>Will you let it</i>
<i>go to your head</i>

955
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,596
<i>Gimme all your lovin'</i>
<i>All your hugs and kisses too</i>

956
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,911
All right, let's go!

957
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,434
- You ready to go, sport?
- You betcha, Dad.
- <i>Gimme all your lovin'</i>

958
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,318
- Now Dasher, now Dancer!
Now Prancer and Vixen!
- <i>All your hugs and kisses too</i>

959
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,676
On Comet, on Cupid!
On Donner and Blitzen!

960
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,193
Bye-bye. Bye, Quintin.
Bye, Peewee.

961
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,071
Merry Christmas.

962
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,871
Take your time.

963
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,832
Turn to your right.
Hello!

964
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,398
No.

965
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,759
- Charlie, stay in your seat.
- I gotta show you this.

966
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,554
Radar-jamming jingle bells,
snow screen,

967
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,114
DC-10 alert
and air freshener.

968
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:22,312
- Wow.
- And most important of all, your hat.

969
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,591
- My hat?
- It's lined with a two-way radio.

970
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,389
Microphone's in here.
It connects you directly to Judy.

971
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,358
- Wait a minute. What's this?
- Oh, that's a C.D.

972
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,552
- Compact disc.
- No. Cookie/ cocoa dispenser.

973
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,795
The cocoa comes out nice and hot.

974
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,799
- And... out pops the cookie.
- <i>Gimme all your lovin'</i>

975
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,112
- How could I have done this
without you, Charlie?
- You couldn't.

976
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,080
- You're fatter this year.
- Thank you very much. You've grown too.

977
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:20,472
And you were a very good girl
this year, but I want you
to go back to sleep, okay?

978
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,556
- I think the milk's a little sour.
- It's soy milk.

979
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,031
- Huh?
- You said you were lactose intolerant.

980
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,719
I did say that, didn't I?
Thanks for remembering.

981
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,990
Go to sleep.

982
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,152
- Merry Christmas, Sara.
- Merry Christmas, Santa.

983
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,110
Look, there's Mom and Neal's street!
Can we go there next?

984
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,311
- Sure.
- I made something for them
at the workshop.

985
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,071
Freeze!

986
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,310
Ah, ho, ho.

987
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,079
You officers really gave me a start.
Merry Christmas, guys.

988
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,874
- Not for you, fat boy.
- "Fat boy"? Guys.

989
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,595
- Uh-uh-uh. Nice and easy now.
- Oh!

990
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,319
Guys, guys, I got a lot of work to do.
This is a big mistake, really.

991
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,437
You gotta watch the suit too. This
is so old. It's an antique, you know.

992
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,476
- Where's the boy?
- He's in the sleigh.

993
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,710
We got Calvin.
We're bringing him out.

994
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,031
<i>Santa, are you okay?</i>
<i>Over. Over.</i>

995
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,752
- Watch your head.
- Santa, are you all right?
- Santa?

996
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:08,237
- It'll be okay, kids.
- Let him go! Let Santa go!

997
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,313
Honey, I'm sure
Charlie's fine.

998
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:39,468
We've got a problem. Santa was at
the Miller's, but he's not responding.

999
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:43,235
Well, time to deploy E.L.F.S.

1000
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,915
- Let's go!
- Go!

1001
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,029
Go, go, go, go!
Move it!

1002
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,718
Look, I know
you're Scott Calvin.

1003
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,952
You know you're Scott Calvin.
So let's make this simple.

1004
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,635
I say, name.
You say, Scott Calvin.

1005
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,075
Name?

1006
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,350
Kriss Kringle.

1007
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,358
- Name?
- <i>Sinter Klas.</i>

1008
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,868
- Name?
- <i>Pere Noel.</i>

1009
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,191
<i>Buono Natale.</i>
<i>Pelz-Nicole.</i>

1010
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,714
Topo Gigio.

1011
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,954
Okay, Calvin. Maybe a couple of hours
in the tank will change your mind.

1012
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,751
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

1013
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,400
Don't worry.
We're the good guys.

1014
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,869
Come on.
Let's go save Santa.

1015
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,793
We can't. The police
are watching this place.

1016
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:37,078
Yeah, they probably are.
But you see, we weren't figuring
on walking out the front door.

1017
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,352
We find that we can get around
a lot faster if we fly.

1018
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,233
Now... grab hold of my hand.

1019
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,158
And hang on tight.

1020
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,310
- And Charlie?
- Yeah?

1021
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,828
Don't ever try this
without elf supervision.

1022
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,157
Hmm? Ah!

1023
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,277
We're looking for Santa Claus.

1024
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,079
Go home, kids.
Visiting hours are over.

1025
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,709
We're not kids,
and we're not visiting.

1026
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,072
- We're here to bust out my dad.
- You're the Calvin boy.

1027
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,032
Who... Who are these
other kids?

1028
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,594
We're your worst nightmare.

1029
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,234
Elves with attitude.

1030
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,675
Shouldn't have had that doughnut.
Oh!

1031
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,836
Untie me! I mean it!

1032
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,229
Untie...

1033
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,915
- Charlie!
- Are you okay, Dad?

1034
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,230
I am now.

1035
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:34,154
- How'd you do that?
- Tinsel. Not just for decoration.

1036
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,758
Hmm.

1037
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,594
Hey, excuse me. Can I get
some of that tinsel?

1038
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,274
Mom?

1039
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,436
Mom!

1040
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,876
Neal. I'm home!

1041
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,117
Charlie?

1042
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,953
- Charlie?
- Charlie.
- Oh, my God, Charlie.

1043
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,231
Sweetheart. Oh, God.
Come here. Come here.

1044
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,709
Oh, my boy.
Oh, my sweetheart.

1045
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,196
Oh! My boy, you're home!

1046
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:11,232
Oh, I missed you so much.
How are you?

1047
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,875
- I'm fine, Mom.
- Are you okay? Look at me.

1048
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,997
- Oh, Charlie. I missed you, honey.
- Mom, I'm fine. It's okay.

1049
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:22,033
- We were so worried
about you. Look at you.
- Mom, put me down. Stop kissing me!

1050
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,475
I don't have a lot of time.

1051
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,553
Did you leave the gifts
I made under the tree?

1052
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,676
- You bet I did.
- We better go.

1053
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,990
- No, Charlie. No, no, no.
- No! No, wait, Charlie.

1054
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,071
It's okay, Laura.

1055
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,957
Actually, I...

1056
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,873
I think it's
a much better idea...

1057
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,595
- that you stay here
with your Mom and Neal.
- Really?

1058
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,791
- But, Dad...
- No buts, Charlie.

1059
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,429
I can't be selfish.
I can't be with you all the time.

1060
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,596
We're a family.

1061
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,875
You, me, your mom...

1062
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,598
and Neal.

1063
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,552
And they need to be with you too.

1064
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,074
I miss you too much.

1065
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,714
Come here a minute.

1066
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,670
Ah, listen to me.

1067
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,876
Come on, listen. There's...
There's a lot of kids out there.

1068
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,957
Okay? Millions of kids.

1069
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:28,795
And they're...
They all... They all believe in me.
They're countin' on me, Charlie. And I...

1070
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,919
I'm not gonna let them down.
I got a lot of work to do.

1071
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,596
So I can't be selfish either.

1072
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:41,832
You gave me a wonderful gift, Charlie.
Listen, a wonderful gift.

1073
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,354
You believed in me
when nobody else did.

1074
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,755
You helped make me Santa.

1075
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,673
Selfish? Come on.

1076
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,230
You're the least...
the least selfish person I know.

1077
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,353
I love you, Santa Claus.

1078
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,554
I love you, son.

1079
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,834
Shh.

1080
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,110
It's okay.

1081
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,116
Okay. It's okay. Shh.

1082
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,357
Laura, what do you think? Christmas Eve
you guys spend with Charlie?

1083
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,916
Oh, my God.

1084
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,755
It's you.

1085
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,436
It really is you.

1086
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,353
You really are...

1087
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,159
Santa Claus.

1088
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,071
Pretty cool, huh?

1089
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,230
Oh, my God.

1090
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,630
And your parents thought
I'd never amount to anything.

1091
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,679
Oh, wait. Don't go yet.
I have something for you. I...

1092
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,471
It's Santa!

1093
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,717
- Scott.
- Neal.

1094
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,235
- Santa?
- It's okay, Neal.

1095
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,115
Here.

1096
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,515
It's, um...
Well, it's...

1097
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,354
It's my Christmas present for you.
It's the, um... It's the custody papers.

1098
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:35,237
And I want you to come and see
Charlie as often as you can.

1099
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,909
You can count on it.
Thanks, Laura.

1100
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,990
Merry Christmas.

1101
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,356
What's all this boo-hooing goin'
on here? Hey, how ya doin'?

1102
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,675
It's nothin', Bernard.
I'm just saying goodbye to Charlie.

1103
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,309
What goodbye? Charlie,
you still got the glass ball, right?

1104
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,755
- Yeah.
- Well, all you gotta do...

1105
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,229
is shake it whenever
you want to see your dad.

1106
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,153
- Really?
- He can come back to see you...

1107
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,231
anytime day or night.

1108
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,630
Hey, have I ever
steered ya wrong?

1109
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,911
Nice sweater.

1110
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,878
Hey, did we make this?

1111
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,315
Laura.

1112
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,828
He's sucking us
into his delusions.

1113
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,595
Look at the elaborate
measures he's taken.

1114
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,229
Neal, relax.

1115
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,271
I'll explain it to you later.

1116
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,477
Where'd he go?

1117
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,353
Go, go, go, go!
Team one, heads up!

1118
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:59,108
- Okay, stand back, folks.
Give us some room.
- I'm scared, Dad.

1119
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,152
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks. Return to your homes!

1120
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:05,949
- Stay off the street. Come on, folks.
Let us do our job here.
- Oh, my gosh. Um...

1121
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,673
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi.

1122
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,076
Um, you know, you don't have to
send anybody... Oh, my gosh, wait!

1123
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,271
- Hey!
- He's my ex-husband,
and he's already up the chimney.

1124
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,669
Chief, look up there.

1125
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,230
Oh, Santa!

1126
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,198
Santa Claus.

1127
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:29,033
Look!

1128
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,231
What is it?

1129
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,118
Oh, wow!

1130
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,760
Up there! Do you see it?
Hey, do you see it?

1131
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,994
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Bye, Dad.

1132
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,834
Merry Christmas to all!
And to all a good night!

1133
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,437
- I'm sorry, Charlie.
- That's okay, Neal.

1134
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,195
You were just denying
your inner child.

1135
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:09,239
You're gonna make a great
psychiatrist one day, kid.

1136
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:13,757
No, I think I'm going to go
into the family business.

1137
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,832
Look out below!

1138
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,073
My wienie whistle.

1139
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,074
Bye, Santa Claus. Bye.

1140
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,072
- Merry Christmas.
- See you next year.

1141
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,794
Charlie?
Time to come inside.

1142
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,274
Mom, this stupid ball's
not working.

1143
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,591
Shoot.

1144
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,636
- Hey, sport.
- Dad!

1145
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,235
You miss me already?
I've been gone, what? Ten minutes.

1146
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,874
Gimme a break.
I was on my way to Cleveland.

1147
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,428
Come here and give me a hug.

1148
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,077
Oh!

1149
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,150
- Do you wanna go for a quick ride?
- Yeah!

1150
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:12,078
- Uh...
- Of course, it's up to your mom.

1151
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,315
Please, Mom.

1152
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:19,431
Go on. Get outta here.

1153
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,080
All right. Hold on.

1154
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,358
- On our way.
- Bye, Mom.

1155
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,309
Just... Just a quick one.

1156
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,439
And, uh, not over any oceans, Scott.

1157
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,476
- Bye, Mom!
- Scott.

1158
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,433
- Bye.
- Scott!

1159
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,951
Santa!

1160
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,836
<i>All the brightly colored</i>
<i>paper</i>

1161
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:33,037
<i>Lies around</i>
<i>the Christmas tree</i>

1162
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,350
<i>While mothers shake</i>
<i>their heads</i>

1163
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,956
<i>And pack the decorations</i>
<i>carefully</i>

1164
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:49,910

<i>Monday's just another day</i>

1166

<i>That Santa's gone away</i>

1168

1175
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,792
