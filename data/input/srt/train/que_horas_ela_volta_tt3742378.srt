1
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,994
Fabinho, look who
came to play with us.

2
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:09,205
Maggie. Where's Maggie?

3
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:11,248
-Little  Maggie
-Little Maggie.

4
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:13,792
Come, now you will
see the greatest champion.

5
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:15,085
Come see. Come see.

6
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,462
The greatest Olympic champion.

7
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:20,382
Let's go to the pool.
Come to the pool.

8
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:22,133
Go.

9
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:24,260
Oh, the animal's going to drown, Ok?

10
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:26,054
I want to see if you'll
save him. Come on.

11
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:27,680
Oh, poor thing.
-It's cold.

12
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,557
It's cold? what are
you talking about?

13
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:30,725
Stop being a pussy, boy.

14
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:32,268
It's hot. Let's go.

15
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,812
-Will you watch me?
-I'm watching!

16
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:37,397
-Swim with me!
-Me? Swim?

17
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:39,817
I don't have a
bathing suit to swim.

18
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:51,160
-Look!
-I'm looking!

19
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:54,372
I see you very well.

20
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:56,207
Convince her.

21
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,127
Tell her mommy misses her.

22
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:05,257
Oh, my love.

23
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:08,719
Oh, mom's precious thing.

24
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:11,263
Are you doing everything
you're supposed to?

25
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:13,890
Are you obeying Sandra?

26
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,851
Alright.

27
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:20,271
Don't talk like that.
Talk straight with your mom.

28
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,523
Talk straight with your mom.

29
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,568
I only called to give you a kiss.

30
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:27,319
Ok, go.

31
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:28,487
Go.

32
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:31,323
Listen, I love you. Hear me?

33
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:32,699
Bye.

34
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:34,951
Who did you say that you love?

35
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:36,411
My daughter.

36
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:37,704
Where is she?

37
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,122
Oh, she's very far away.

38
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:49,131
And my mom? Where is she?

39
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,675
You're mom is working, love.

40
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:54,512
What time is she coming back?

41
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:56,472
I don't know.

42
00:03:58,431 --> 00:03:59,474
Oh, my gosh.

43
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:12,570
The Second Mother

44
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,003
Fabinho?

45
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,589
Fabinho..

46
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,174
Go away, go away.

47
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:37,426
You're going to wake them up.

48
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,639
I'm getting some ice,
because this juice is too hot.

49
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:48,853
There had to be another one here.

50
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,356
I can't believe something like this.

51
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,984
How is it that someone
takes away the ice

52
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:55,777
and puts the tray

53
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:57,904
back in the freezer, empty?

54
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:00,030
They have to be very bad.

55
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,284
This upsets me.

56
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:06,537
And take into account I
am a free spirited person...

57
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:08,664
very nice.

58
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,541
But when I see

59
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,001
It's a bad person who
does that kind of thing.

60
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:14,711
You know?

61
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,921
Val?

62
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:19,967
Remember that girl Bruna
I told you about from school?

63
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:21,425
Cute.

64
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:22,927
Here.

65
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:26,889
She dumped me with two
messages. Again.

66
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:30,434
-There are stupid women
in this world, huh?

67
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,606
Will I die a virgin?

68
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,983
Who's stupid idea is that?

69
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,067
That Bruna.

70
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,403
A handsome guy like you.

71
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:44,948
Look, There is no boy like
you in Brazil.

72
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:46,783
A handsome boy
with those big blue eyes.

73
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,701
You look like the prince of England.

74
00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:51,245
What's the youngest one's name?

75
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:31,450
Dr. Carlos,
It's already eleven, you know?

76
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:34,160
Won't you stop with
the renovations, Tony?

77
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,955
I'm not going to give
you lunch, you hear me?

78
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:38,289
Oh, my goodness val.

79
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,917
Does that man eat?
take away that dropping

80
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,419
from him, then he will work.

81
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:44,003
At home he's a saint.

82
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:45,046
He goes to school and he looks

83
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:46,172
like the devil's
inside his body.

84
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:47,798
I don't know. He bites the kids,

85
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,717
Now, he hasn't been
shitting for five days.

86
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:53,011
You only give him Mucilon,
Mucilon, Mucillon

87
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,932
You can't give him only Mucilon.
You have to give him a fruit, a food.

88
00:06:57,391 --> 00:06:59,642
Poor thing, when he
comes at night, he eats

89
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:01,311
what he likes, makes him happy.

90
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:02,687
What he likes...

91
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,981
A child doesn't get to want something,

92
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,607
You spoil him too much.

93
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:12,488
It's easy for you to say,
it's hard to raise a kid on your own.

94
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:15,575
At night,
I want to see his face, laughing.

95
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:24,291
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:33,549
-Are you done?
-I'm done, thank you.

97
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:36,427
Would you like anything else?

98
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:39,138
I'd like another Guaraná, please.

99
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,557
You don't want anything else?

100
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,308
-No, thank you.
-My food wasn't good

101
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,851
at all, you didn't eat anything.

102
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:48,396
Didn't eat anything.

103
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,276
It was...No, it was Guaraná.

104
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:55,111
Guaraná.

105
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:11,585
Are you going to take
the medicine with sugar?

106
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:17,382
$250 Reais to get prescription..

107
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,509
..for some creams.
-For the love of God.

108
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,887
-I don't know why you have a dog.
-Security,

109
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:25,097
What? Security? A slow dog like that.
-Can I eat another one?

110
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,183
A thief comes and she'll lick
him and will leave wagging her tail.

111
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:29,726
-Only one?

112
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:31,645
Put more onions here.

113
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,647
-He wants two steaks.
-Of course.

114
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:36,358
I don't eat this salad. I
don't eat purple things.

115
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,484
Put it there.

116
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,487
Go away, dog! The dog is licking
everything. I'm disgusted.

117
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:44,407
My baby...

118
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:47,994
Get the farofa, Val.

119
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:08,680
Val?

120
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:10,348
I'm leaving.

121
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:11,558
Ok, hon.

122
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:14,310
Smell.

123
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:23,319
-Go safely.
-See you Wednesday. Amen.

124
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:43,754
-Is it yours, Carlos?

125
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:47,549
-Val bring an ice cream, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

126
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,385
-So it's yours, right?
-Of course not.

127
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:53,472
No, we've smoked pot. You think your
father and I, we never smoked pot?

128
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,058
Of course we smoked pot,
but we...right?

129
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,437
I wouldn’t get crazy, I wouldn't
use it in this absurd quantity.

130
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:03,064
Don't believe me then.
What can I do about it?

131
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:06,234
If you're saying it's not yours,
then I believe you.

132
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:08,402
-So you believe it's not his?
-Yeah.

133
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:10,321
But we're having a cool conversation.

134
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:13,658
That's right, I'm giving him an
opportunity to talk

135
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:17,619
You want to smoke pot, you can
you just don't need to smoke this much.

136
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:19,079
If it were mine, I'd say it.

137
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,498
Maybe some friend of his
put it there as a prank.

138
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,499
A friend, huh?

139
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:24,709
Pour some for me, please. A friend.

140
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:28,087
Alright. So you're going to
continue to tell me it's not yours.

141
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:30,256
Then I will throw it away.

142
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,341
Can I do that?

143
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,511
It's not yours, it's
not Carlos', it's

144
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,178
not mine either, so
I'll throw it away.

145
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,014
Go ahead and throw it,
if you think it's best.

146
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,229
Don't complicate things.

147
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,563
I believe you.

148
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,273
You believe me?

149
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,903
Let's make it alright, please?

150
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,865
It's delicious. Are you hungry?
Do you like it, Fabinho?

151
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:01,451
I'm going to get the
syrup for the desert. Excuse me.

152
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,038
Val!

153
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,374
Um..is there syrup?

154
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:11,086
Over there.

155
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,341
Can you get it for me, please?

156
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:30,729
You have nothing in your mind.

157
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:35,025
window, little window,
door, doorbell.

158
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:37,194
I'm already a big man, Val.

159
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:41,572
He is very adorable, he is

160
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:43,742
Very funny

161
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:45,201
He is

162
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:48,621
little Val's, he is...

163
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:50,247
very adorable...

164
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:51,832
He is...

165
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,501
very funny...

166
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,004
Ah Ok, you learned how
to wash behind your ears.

167
00:11:57,004 --> 00:11:59,756
We are back with
"I want to be cute too."

168
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:02,593
Well, as we saw in one
of last block's subjects,

169
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:04,469
fashion is really very democratic.

170
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:06,512
For example,
today I was leaving home

171
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,639
And I was focusing in Marginal street

172
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:11,434
there was a group of
teenagers at the bus stop

173
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:13,853
and it was really a...it was a party.

174
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:16,188
it was colorful clothing,

175
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:19,149
the sneakers each one
different from the other,

176
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,569
But at the same time
there was harmony, you know?

177
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,237
Yes.

178
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:25,614
Hi.

179
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:28,200
If I were to show you guys,
you'd be able to see

180
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:29,367
Hello?

181
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,744
They mix together,

182
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,704
it becomes so cool, you could

183
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:35,039
cite the clothes,
I have a man...

184
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,084
Hi!

185
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:40,878
Who is it?

186
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,344
Hi!

187
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,681
I can't hear...

188
00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:54,475
Jessica, is that you?

189
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,268
Hi, my daughter.

190
00:12:58,728 --> 00:12:59,771
Hi.

191
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,731
What happened?

192
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,402
Oh man!

193
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:09,655
It's not.

194
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,327
You're going to Sao Paulo?

195
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:20,248
Don't do this to your
mom. You got to be kidding me.

196
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,002
No, I like it. I think it's good.

197
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:28,173
But there's no...

198
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,883
Listen, there is no more time.

199
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:33,928
How long has it been since
Fabinho registered?

200
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:38,223
in the internet?

201
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:41,059
You can do that?

202
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,586
-I'm going.
-Where are you going so gussied up?

203
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:11,796
Fabinho, go take care of your life.

204
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,466
Respect is good and I like it.

205
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,054
Mrs. Barbara...

206
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:20,721
Hi.

207
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,724
I've been needing to talk to you

208
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:25,309
Wow, you smell good!

209
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:26,477
Oh, my goodness.

210
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,729
Ok, you can talk. Did
you leave the lasagna there?

211
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:32,983
I left it there inside the oven, because I couldn't
put it in the freezer because it was too hot.

212
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:34,234
Ok. Ok. Thank you, love.

213
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:37,112
Come earlier on Monday,
Ok? It's my birthday dinner.

214
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:40,365
-How would I forget?
-Ok? Thank you. Kisses.

215
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:40,991
And uh...

216
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:43,242
..Kisses, love.
-Bye.

217
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,369
Go away, Maggie. Maggie.

218
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:47,663
Maggie, honestly, Maggie.

219
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,202
How long has it been?

220
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:32,914
That Pamela has been living,
has been living with you?

221
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,165
Four years!

222
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,959
Oh, my gosh! That long?

223
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:45,801
And is it working out?

224
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,043
Fabinho.

225
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:24,962
Fabinho, it's almost seven AM.

226
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:49,527
-Hi.
-Hi.

227
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:53,697
Please, we are recording here,
can you make a little less noise?

228
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,241
Thank you.

229
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,559
You are a  woman who
dictates style, a trendsetter,

230
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,643
Yeah, a little.

231
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,728
Define style for me.

232
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,398
People, style has no secrets.

233
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:31,984
You know?
You can't make anything up.

234
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:33,777
Style means getting to know yourself.

235
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:36,404
You assume yourself and...

236
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:38,615
That's why I believe style

237
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,700
is being who you are.

238
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,243
You know?
-Marvelous.

239
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,078
You really are awesome.

240
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:46,205
-Thank you.
-Thank you, dear.

241
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,916
-Pleasure.
-The pleasure is all mine.

242
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,417
And happy birthday.
-Thank you.

243
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,419
And cut.

244
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,254
Thank you, everyone.

245
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:56,715
-See if you can come tonight.
-Ah, alright..

246
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:58,299
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

247
00:17:58,341 --> 00:17:59,300
Thank you.

248
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:03,596
Will you call Janaina
and let her know when you go there?

249
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:05,931
Of course, of course. We are only
going to clean up here

250
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:09,227
-No, make yourself at home.
-Thank you.

251
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:13,021
Congratulations, Mrs. Barbara.

252
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,776
-Oh thank you, Val, thank you.
-Wish you the best.

253
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:18,861
A very great year to you, Mrs.

254
00:18:18,902 --> 00:18:23,573
-Oh, I need it.
-Ah, please excuse the mess.

255
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,410
You bought me a present? Thank you.

256
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:29,162
Can I open it?
-Yes, please.

257
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:30,246
Ah, let's see, let's see.

258
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:32,707
the lady at the store says
it is selling lots of them.

259
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:35,043
-Oh yeah, it is selling lots of them?
-Yeah, people are using it a lot.

260
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:38,796
Oh, look! Awesome!

261
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:41,674
How pretty! Fantastic!

262
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:44,384
-You like it, didn't you?
-I did.

263
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:45,469
Let's put it away, Ok?

264
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:49,306
Let's put it away to use it in a
special occasion. In a moment...

265
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:52,934
-It's Ok.
-Ok? Take it for me and put it away.

266
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:55,144
Mrs. Barbara?

267
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:58,648
I'd like to have a conversation with you.
-Go ahead.

268
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:02,110
-Jessica called me on Thursday.
-Who's Jessica?

269
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:04,403
-My daughter.
-Ah, your daughter.

270
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,489
-And Jessica wants to...
-Wait just a minute, just a minute, val.

271
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:08,907
Hello.

272
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,034
Hi, Leo, how are you?

273
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,994
I don't know, love.

274
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:14,747
No, you call Janaina

275
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:16,331
check with her.

276
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,835
It's true.

277
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,753
Thank you, thank you, dear.

278
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:23,880
Kisses

279
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:26,591
Bye. Bye.

280
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,219
Ok. Jessica...um...

281
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:33,180
wants to come to São
Paulo to stay with me.

282
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,181
Are you kidding?

283
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,433
How wonderful, Val.
how great!

284
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,560
Right? What is she going to do here?

285
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:40,854
She's coming to apply
for college admission.

286
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:42,355
What is she going to study?

287
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:44,649
-I don't know. No, madam.
-No?

288
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,025
I don't know, madam.

289
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:49,195
But I wanted to see with
you, if in the very beginning,

290
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:54,116
just in the beginning, if she could
stay with us until I find a place.

291
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:56,118
Of course she can!

292
00:19:56,452 --> 00:20:00,372
Of course, sweetie. You are
practically a part of the family.

293
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:02,499
You helped me take care of Fabinho.

294
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,209
Something so badly resolved.

295
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:07,295
How long has it been since
you've seen each other?

296
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:09,422
It's been more than ten years.

297
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,924
Wow!

298
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:13,384
In the beginning I wasn't
able to go see her,

299
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:16,595
You remember the problem with
her father. I couldn't go

300
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:19,348
but even then, after I got rid
of that pain in the ass,

301
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,518
I was struggling, calling, calling

302
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,478
she didn't want to talk to me,

303
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,687
She never wanted to talk to me,

304
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,272
she would

305
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:29,566
and would say "It’s Val, your mom."

306
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,442
"She went out, she went out."

307
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:33,528
It's been more than three years
since I don't speak to her. I

308
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,488
found it strange when she called
saying she wants to come.

309
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,866
But are you looking for a place
for you both to stay?

310
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:42,370
Yes, I've been asking about
who has a little place here..

311
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:43,579
..to rent, right?
-No, no.

312
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,289
I'm not asking you
this for a reason.

313
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:48,542
You can stay here for as long
as you want, there is no problem at all.

314
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:52,420
Thank you very much. I'm going to
get a mattress to put in the room,

315
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:54,089
Ok, buy a very good one.

316
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:56,424
Buy a good one because I
insist on paying for it.

317
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:58,677
Ok? Tell me how much
it is so I can give you the money.

318
00:20:58,677 --> 00:21:01,012
You're wonderful, Mrs. Barbara,
you're like a mom to me.

319
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,139
What? Mom? here,
don't forget the moose cake.

320
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:06,100
Ok? Double recipe. Kisses, sweetie.

321
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,228
Bye!
-Bye.

322
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,651
Trix Casa.

323
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,446
Contains six tea cups,

324
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,240
with saucers and a tray.

325
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,495
It goes this way.

326
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,414
But it's mismatched

327
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,375
One black...

328
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,794
and one white.

329
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,171
And then the white

330
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,007
with the black,

331
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,134
And then the black

332
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,470
There.

333
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,430
Oh, how pretty.

334
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,098
And here

335
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,976
Yeah, it's mismatched.

336
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,853
A white

337
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:55,896
They like it like this, right?

338
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,816
It's the thermos'

339
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:05,322
It has a thermos.

340
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:12,621
Where's the thermos?

341
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:14,330
Oh my!

342
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:15,499
My god!

343
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:19,669
The thermos is...

344
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:21,754
So I have to take out one.

345
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:26,175
So if I put the thermos,

346
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:28,927
I have to take out the tea cup?

347
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:31,930
Maybe it's with the thermos like this.

348
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,226
But then it wouldn't be presentable.

349
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:39,562
In the photo...

350
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,441
No. It's with the thermos.
The right way

351
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:45,068
is with the thermos.

352
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:49,155
I'm going to hide this tea cup.

353
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:06,254
I can't stand it anymore.

354
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:08,882
For the love of God,
give me something.

355
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:10,550
I'm not going to stand it.

356
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,337
It's only one, you hear me, Skull?

357
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,047
You're going to deny to your fiancé?

358
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:56,634
It's only one. Show some respect, Ok?
Go cut your hair!

359
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:01,514
It really is good, right?

360
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:39,924
-What's wrong, Mrs. Barbara?
-Val, for the love of God, not this one.

361
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:40,967
Where did you get this one?

362
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,510
I told you that this one
we're taking to Guarujá.

363
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,138
-But...
-You get that one made of...

364
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:48,266
of white wood that I brought from
Sweden, for the love of God, Ok?

365
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,310
But you said it was
for a special occasion.

366
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,311
Oh, Ok.

367
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:40,898
Good night.
Let's get going.

368
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:56,621
Val?

369
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,012
Look. A little gift for you.

370
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,598
You are pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty, pretty.

371
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:17,892
Thank you.

372
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:20,060
Oh, my God.

373
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,227
Look at that.

374
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:25,983
Are you hungry, my daughter?
-No, it's alright.

375
00:26:26,024 --> 00:26:27,901
You got scared, did you?

376
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:32,280
No. I have a little something
here that Sandra sent you.

377
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:38,244
Do you want to take it already?
-What is this?

378
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:41,164
It's better to give it to
you now, or I'll forget

379
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:44,165
She told me to
give it to you. It's coconut sweet..

380
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,919
-Oh, I love this coconut sweet..
-It smells good.

381
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:50,005
It's the jawbreaker.
I know which one she sends.

382
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:52,298
Let's go?
-let's go.

383
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:54,717
Let's go home. Let's
go, let's leave.

384
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:57,429
You don't want to eat anything?
You're not hungry?   -No.

385
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:58,679
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure.

386
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:00,264
- I'm fine.
- Do you want me to carry

387
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:01,724
anything? Do you
want me to push?

388
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:03,142
No. No carts.

389
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:05,436
You're so cute.

390
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:15,362
Your father?

391
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:18,073
What about him?

392
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:21,784
Your father. How is he?

393
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:25,705
He's not speaking to me.

394
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,748
What did you do?

395
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,293
Just bullshit of his.

396
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:34,672
It wasn't bullshit for
your dad to stop talking to you.

397
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,975
Are you liking it?

398
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:49,936
Yes, what place is this here we are now?

399
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:53,314
It's Marginal Tietê. It's the Tietê River.

400
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:55,441
Oh, I see.

401
00:27:57,651 --> 00:28:02,030
Alright, there, over here,
look, is the Largo da Batata.

402
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,492
Oh, I've heard about
this place already.

403
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:06,660
That there are more
north-easterners

404
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,370
here than in the northeast.
Isn't there a story like this?

405
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,789
There only were
north-easterners.

406
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,834
But now to put a subway here,
look, they paved everything.

407
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:17,628
It's looking like, I don't
know what, it's not a square,

408
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,338
because there isn't
a bush walk here.

409
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:23,759
They cemented everything and took away
everything. There was a lot of forró here,

410
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:26,012
All this was full of crowds.

411
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:28,430
A little bar, many
good stores, but now,

412
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:32,058
-You used to come here a lot? Walk here?
-I did. Raimunda and I.

413
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,602
Look, what is that? it's not a square.

414
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:38,356
It's not...I don't know what that is.

415
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,025
Will it still take a while for us to arrive?

416
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:44,695
No, it's very near. It will
be about ten minutes.

417
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:49,158
They are very excited to meet you.

418
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:50,867
They are very anxious.

419
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:53,496
They? Who?

420
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,206
Barbara, Dr. Carlos,

421
00:28:56,497 --> 00:28:57,541
right?

422
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:58,833
Fabinho,

423
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:00,752
everyone.

424
00:29:05,882 --> 00:29:08,467
Later we can plan some time
to go there, right?

425
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,303
No, we're already going.

426
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:14,556
I just arrived. I'm tired.

427
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:18,477
We can plan to go later.

428
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:21,063
No, we're going there now.

429
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,690
I still live there.

430
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,944
What do you mean
you still live there, Val?

431
00:29:28,486 --> 00:29:30,571
Are you taking me
to your bosses' house?

432
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:35,159
I live at work. I already said that.
I live at work.

433
00:29:35,993 --> 00:29:38,871
You live in tiny room in
the back of their house?

434
00:29:40,497 --> 00:29:42,165
You're going to love Fabinho.

435
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:45,252
For the love of God,
I'm not believing this.

436
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:52,717
-Calm down. Calm down.
-You're taking me to someone else's house?

437
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,429
Alright.

438
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:59,140
This here is my little corner.

439
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:03,101
You see? Look.

440
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,687
Television, everything in
the right place.

441
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,899
Ah, let me show you.

442
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,567
The brand new mattress

443
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:13,653
that she brought for you.
First class.

444
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:15,738
Here, look.

445
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,992
bed linen, towel,
everything you need.

446
00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:20,535
You hear?

447
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,662
I don't know if the
mattress will fit here.

448
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:24,872
Of course it will. Look.

449
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,792
Let me open here to aerate.

450
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:30,544
I'll pull it now.

451
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:34,631
-Afterwards, we'll tidy up.
-No. It fit. It's done.

452
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,592
Ok, now all we need to do is cover it.

453
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:38,969
Now...

454
00:30:39,302 --> 00:30:41,721
Ah, you're looking at it.
You liked it, did you?

455
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:45,016
This here, is a juicer.

456
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:46,809
This is a...

457
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:49,145
it's an electric fan,

458
00:30:49,478 --> 00:30:52,022
a good one,
not this crappy one here,

459
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:55,317
All this I bought for you and I.

460
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:00,530
Where am I going to study here?

461
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,658
They're home. They're home!

462
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:40,068
Are you done, Fabinho?

463
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,653
Fabinho?
-Yes, I'm done.

464
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:45,197
-Carlos, are you going to eat more?
-No.

465
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,825
-Val!
-Yes?

466
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,534
You can clean the table, please.

467
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,370
I'm going.

468
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,295
Excuse me.

469
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:01,921
Thank you.

470
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,173
Where is she, is she here?

471
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:07,009
-Jessica? Yes she is ma'am.
-Oh, yeah?

472
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,512
-Let me see that, Fabinho.
-Bring her here for us to meet her.

473
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:10,596
She's coming.
-Thank you, Val.

474
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,014
I'm curious.
-I'll go call her.

475
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,516
I'm going.

476
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,393
Jessica?

477
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,270
She's so happy. How cute.

478
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,067
Come, my daughter.

479
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:28,654
Look, Mrs. Barbara.

480
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:30,365
Oh, how beautiful.

481
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,325
Look, this is for you.

482
00:32:33,325 --> 00:32:35,411
Oh, my goodness.

483
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,329
Welcome.

484
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:39,456
What a pleasure. Thank you.

485
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:41,374
We like your mom very much.

486
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:44,753
Your mom is very important to
everyone in this house so are you.

487
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:46,963
How is everything, Jessica?
Ok? Make yourself at home.

488
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:49,090
Dr. Carlos, and Fabinho...

489
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,300
How's it going?

490
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,886
Have you been to Sao Paulo before?

491
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:55,764
No, only in the pictures.

492
00:32:56,138 --> 00:32:58,349
The internet, the movies...

493
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:00,434
She talks just like Val.

494
00:33:01,852 --> 00:33:02,853
What is that?

495
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,396
-Very similar.
-Oh, yes.

496
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:07,357
Jessica brought a coconut sweet.

497
00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:11,570
-Oh, nice...
-Actually, we call it jawbreaker.

498
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,946
I'm going to get a piece.

499
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:14,906
No, I don't even want...
it just...

500
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:16,491
I can't even get
near that, because

501
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:17,909
it fattens you just
by looking at it.

502
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,618
It's delicious.
-It's pretty.

503
00:33:19,618 --> 00:33:20,745
Very delicious.

504
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:22,621
Your mom says you're applying for

505
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:24,039
college admission, is that right?

506
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:26,166
-Yes.
-What will you be studying?

507
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,460
Architecture.

508
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:29,586
-Architecture?
-At FAU?

509
00:33:29,794 --> 00:33:31,171
Yeah, at FAU.

510
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:34,049
What is it, Mrs. Barbara,
what''s the problem?

511
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:35,383
None, it's just that FAU is one

512
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:36,885
of the hardest colleges
to get admission to.

513
00:33:36,926 --> 00:33:39,638
-Is it true, Mrs. Barbara? Is it difficult?
-Yes, it's very competitive.

514
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,306
I'm aware.

515
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:42,599
But the school there,
where you went to, was it good?

516
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:44,392
-The teaching there?
-Yes.

517
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:46,394
No it wasn't very good.

518
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:47,854
Oh, poor thing.

519
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:50,732
But I always had help.

520
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:53,025
Right? And I met a history professor,

521
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:55,569
João Emanuel, who helped me a lot.

522
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:57,279
He helped you how?
How did he help you?

523
00:33:58,489 --> 00:34:02,283
Oh, he...had a very criticizing
vision of things

524
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:06,663
So he gave us lots of important
things for us to think.

525
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:10,166
He put our minds to work,
putting together a theater group...

526
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:12,794
And why architecture?

527
00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:18,090
Why did you choose Architecture?

528
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:21,218
Ah, there are many things, I think.

529
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,638
I always liked to draw,
so that's already a readiness,

530
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,016
and I have an uncle who is a contractor,
Uncle Adejado.

531
00:34:28,058 --> 00:34:31,394
Yeah, Adejado, Evicto, and Adejá,
they are three siblings.

532
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:35,690
And then I helped him and
I learned many things, too

533
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,692
at the same time. And
then I made floor plans.

534
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:39,026
I made a floor plan of a house

535
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:41,487
there, a townhouse that
they even ended up building,

536
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:43,239
Look at that.

537
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,366
I think it's important I have a diploma,

538
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:47,534
-Of course.
-And I believe that architecture

539
00:34:47,534 --> 00:34:49,202
is an instrument
for social change

540
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:50,579
You see?

541
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,788
The country is really changing.

542
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,248
-Would you look at that?
-Awesome.

543
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:54,707
-Very good.
-Very good.

544
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,250
Good luck.

545
00:35:03,465 --> 00:35:05,884
The house is a bit modernist, right?

546
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:09,012
But not being exactly modernist

547
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,515
Wow, your daughter's intelligent, Val.

548
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:15,811
You should see her report card.
It's all A's from top to bottom.

549
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,063
Val, will you bring a cup
of water for me please?

550
00:35:18,063 --> 00:35:18,897
Yes sir.

551
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,901
I'm not intelligent, I'm curious.

552
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:25,361
Isn't that the same thing?

553
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:30,991
I really wanted to read this book here,
I was even looking for it.

554
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:32,534
And you have time
to read other things

555
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:34,078
besides studying for
the entrance exam?

556
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:37,581
-I like to read.
-Thank you.

557
00:35:38,957 --> 00:35:41,001
Then take it, take it to read.

558
00:35:41,418 --> 00:35:42,753
-Can I?
-Of course.

559
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,921
Come see the pool.

560
00:35:55,014 --> 00:35:57,766
Val, would you turn on
the pool lights, please?

561
00:36:05,607 --> 00:36:07,359
A beautiful thing, isn't it?

562
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:09,278
It's beautiful.

563
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:15,033
I like to read, too.

564
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,619
Yeah. Fabinho is also a very
good student. Aren't you, Fabinho?

565
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:20,997
Right, Dr. Carlos?
-Good student.

566
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:29,129
Let's go see Fabinho's room?

567
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:48,481
They are all suites, right?

568
00:36:50,732 --> 00:36:51,858
Look, Jessica.

569
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:53,943
Fabinho.

570
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:57,030
Fabinho was like this when I first came.

571
00:36:57,156 --> 00:36:59,324
Ah, so cute.

572
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:01,034
The famous Fabinho.

573
00:37:01,492 --> 00:37:03,035
And you are the famous Jessica.

574
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:06,414
What about that door over here?

575
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:12,711
-Over there is the guest room, right?
-Yes, the guest room.

576
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:14,922
You want to see?

577
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,275
Another suite.

578
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:43,823
Look, what a comfortable mattress.
-Jessica.

579
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,079
-I'm sorry, sir
-Such a great mattress and no one sleeps here?

580
00:37:49,454 --> 00:37:50,913
It's the guest room.

581
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:53,291
So it's where I'm going to stay.

582
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,959
Did you lose your mind?

583
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:57,795
For the love of God, for the
love of God, for the love of God.

584
00:37:57,879 --> 00:38:00,715
-Do you want to stay here?
-Yeah, I think it would be good to study here.

585
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:03,592
It wouldn't have any interference.
-No, Jessica. You'll stay in my room.

586
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:05,636
-Did you lose your mind?
-What happened?

587
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:07,721
Jessica is going to stay here.

588
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:11,433
-It's Ok.
-I think it's better if she stays in my room.

589
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:13,226
It has already been
arranged that way.

590
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:15,812
Mrs. Barbara even bought a mattress.

591
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:17,772
Very comfortable.

592
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:23,319
-No, Doctor Carlos, there's no need.
She can stay there

593
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:25,821
with me, won't
bother anyone.

594
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:30,243
-Alright. I'm going to get things. I'll come in a bit.
-Jessica stop being pushy!

595
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:34,830
-Pushy? But he's inviting me.
-But it's only because you said "It's here I'm staying."

596
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,137
Ah.

597
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,264
It's you.

598
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:55,850
I can't sleep, Val.

599
00:38:56,641 --> 00:38:58,060
Fabinho, I'm tired.

600
00:38:58,728 --> 00:39:02,063
-Ok. I'm to sleep here, alright?
-Alright, but we're not going to keep chatting.

601
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:04,190
Because tomorrow I wake up early.

602
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:07,777
What's gotten into you?

603
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:10,113
I can't sleep.

604
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:12,449
I'll stay here with you.

605
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:17,995
Do some caress here.

606
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:19,496
Fabinho.

607
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:22,249
What?

608
00:39:24,877 --> 00:39:26,295
And Jessica?

609
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,006
What about Jessica?

610
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,217
What do you think of Jessica?

611
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:36,846
A little strange, right?

612
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,641
Strange how?

613
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:42,768
I don't know.

614
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:44,895
Too confident about herself.

615
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:48,482
She is too confident.

616
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,401
That's it. She's confident.

617
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:53,737
Her eyes.

618
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:57,908
She looks at everything.
Looks like the president.

619
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,082
Fabinho?

620
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,084
Huh?

621
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:29,813
Val?

622
00:40:46,995 --> 00:40:48,037
Val?

623
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:12,561
Good morning.

624
00:41:14,562 --> 00:41:15,563
Good morning.

625
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:21,402
Were you with your mother?

626
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:23,070
I haven't seen her today.

627
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:26,240
Do you know where she might be?

628
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:28,576
She's probably sleeping.

629
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:31,703
It's strange, because I went to her room,
knocked and she didn't answer.

630
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:41,254
Have you eaten?

631
00:41:42,756 --> 00:41:43,798
I just woke up.

632
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,933
Do you want to eat?

633
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,809
Oh, let me see.

634
00:41:56,685 --> 00:41:59,104
Excuse me. There is...there's bread...

635
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:03,233
There's white bread, there's wheat bread,

636
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:05,902
Let me get a cloth for you here.

637
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:10,448
Sit down.

638
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:12,867
What do you want to drink?

639
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,413
What kind of juice is that?

640
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:18,998
it's Palestinian Sweet Lime.

641
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,459
You're not going to drink that?

642
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:24,461
No, I'll make one for
you. Do you want one?

643
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:26,212
Sure.

644
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:59,702
Is it good? Did you like it?

645
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,207
-I liked it.
-It's good, right? It's so good for you.

646
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:16,051
Jeez.

647
00:43:17,218 --> 00:43:19,303
Oh, Mrs. Barbara,
this never happened to me before.

648
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:23,016
I think the alarm didn't go off,
I completely lost track of time.

649
00:43:23,307 --> 00:43:25,309
-It's Ok.
-What do you want? A toast?

650
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:27,436
-No, I already ate.
-No, I'll make a toast for you.

651
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:29,188
You don't need to. I'm
already leaving, Val.

652
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:32,524
-For the love of God, Mrs. Barbara.
-Oh, your daughter loved the jelly.

653
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,652
Bye.

654
00:43:34,777 --> 00:43:35,819
What was that?

655
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,034
Jessica...

656
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:44,870
Who put the breakfast table?

657
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:47,080
It was Barbara.

658
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:50,083
Goodness, it's not "Barbara"
it's Mrs. Barbara.

659
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:53,877
You sound like you're...crazy.
Barbara.

660
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:56,463
And you can't sit at their table.

661
00:43:57,214 --> 00:44:00,051
-Which one is their table?
-It's that one.

662
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:03,011
And where's the other
one? I don't see it.

663
00:44:03,011 --> 00:44:04,429
Am I going to eat standing?

664
00:44:04,722 --> 00:44:06,682
She was the one who told me to sit here.

665
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:07,974
Get off that table.

666
00:44:07,974 --> 00:44:09,684
I'm eating. Hold on.

667
00:44:14,397 --> 00:44:16,732
-Get off the table!
-I'm eating, Val.

668
00:44:16,732 --> 00:44:18,234
Let me finish.

669
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:21,946
Blessed Mary.
What were you thinking?

670
00:44:22,905 --> 00:44:25,658
The housekeeper's daughter
sitting at the bosses' table.

671
00:44:26,575 --> 00:44:29,035
They aren't my bosses, Val.

672
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,122
Come on. Val? Can't
you call me mom?

673
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:35,124
-I can.
-Thank you.

674
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:43,424
There, I'm done.

675
00:44:44,592 --> 00:44:46,969
Blessed Mary, I have
never seen this before.

676
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:50,180
You're crazy. You have
no idea about anything.

677
00:44:56,936 --> 00:44:59,397
Leave that for me to wash, go. go.

678
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:01,941
-I'm going to my room to study.
-That's right, go.

679
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:20,667
Hi, son.

680
00:45:23,295 --> 00:45:25,172
What do you want, sweetie?

681
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:27,465
Juice.

682
00:45:27,757 --> 00:45:29,801
Do you want a grilled cheese?

683
00:45:30,343 --> 00:45:31,386
Yes.

684
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:44,899
Go ahead and put the
ladder next to the plant.

685
00:45:45,482 --> 00:45:46,525
There.

686
00:45:49,944 --> 00:45:51,780
Now. Faster, Edna.

687
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:56,826
Here.

688
00:45:58,077 --> 00:45:59,829
Pay attention.
Pay attention.

689
00:46:00,371 --> 00:46:03,750
Pretend you are trimming and
I'll pretend that I'm watering.

690
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,376
And keep spying.

691
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:10,088
Pretend you are trimming and
I'll pretend that I'm watering.

692
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:12,925
Do you understand? Understand?

693
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:16,886
This is unbalanced. Hold it for me.

694
00:46:19,097 --> 00:46:20,640
She's reading..

695
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,976
-What is she doing?
-She's reading. She has the book like this

696
00:46:23,976 --> 00:46:25,895
-Reading?
-Yes. She's seated.

697
00:46:25,936 --> 00:46:27,480
She must be studying.

698
00:46:27,604 --> 00:46:29,774
She could be sleeping, I don't..

699
00:46:29,774 --> 00:46:31,650
..see her face.
-She is studying.

700
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:33,235
She got up.

701
00:46:33,778 --> 00:46:35,070
She lay on the bed,

702
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,115
Pretend you are trimming and
I'll pretend that I'm watering.

703
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:44,496
-And now, what is she doing?
-I don't know if she's going to bed

704
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:46,206
She grabbed the book.

705
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:49,542
Don't let her see you. Don't.
Get down. Get down.

706
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:51,919
-Get down.
-The whole day.

707
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:53,212
Get down, get down.
-The person gets crazy reading all day.

708
00:46:53,212 --> 00:46:55,715
Get down the ladder.
Give it to me. Give it to me. Give me.

709
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:08,851
Jessica?

710
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:14,273
Hold on.

711
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,734
-It's mom, Jessica.
-Hold on.

712
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:25,116
Ok. This here is Edna.

713
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:29,079
She works with me. She's
a little sister I have her in São Paulo.

714
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:31,206
-Pleasure.
-Likewise.

715
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:35,209
-She looks like you, huh?
-Yeah.

716
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:36,752
You think so?

717
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:39,047
I think she looks like her father.

718
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:42,091
Pretty, but she looks so thin, though.

719
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:46,387
So, uh...

720
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:49,055
Edna wants to come in for a bit.

721
00:47:49,556 --> 00:47:52,100
To vacuum, clean the room.

722
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:53,727
No worries. I already tidied up.

723
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:56,313
Everything is in the right
place all cleaned up.

724
00:47:57,105 --> 00:48:01,692
-So...
-No, it's that Mrs. Barbara, she...

725
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,821
She's very picky about this, so
I have to vacuum.

726
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:08,240
Yeah, she...

727
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,701
-Does she really check everything?
-She passes her finger

728
00:48:10,743 --> 00:48:14,830
-Get your things. Let's go upstairs.
-It's just that I'm studying, Val.

729
00:48:14,872 --> 00:48:16,123
Everything is all here.

730
00:48:16,123 --> 00:48:17,874
No, let's go.
Grab your book and

731
00:48:17,874 --> 00:48:19,918
let's go study in the
kitchen with me.

732
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,964
-It's cool there, right?
-It's just that Edna is going to vacuum.

733
00:48:24,381 --> 00:48:26,549
I'll go get the rest of my things.

734
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:32,472
I don't know what's worse
Clodomil or Pingulim.

735
00:48:32,555 --> 00:48:35,390
I didn't like it, either.
But Pingulim sounds nicer.

736
00:48:36,225 --> 00:48:38,310
Don't you think?
-Poor thing.

737
00:48:38,478 --> 00:48:41,022
Each one worse than the other.

738
00:48:41,146 --> 00:48:42,189
Yeah.

739
00:48:43,899 --> 00:48:45,651
So, are you enjoying São Paulo?

740
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:48,820
I arrived only yesterday.

741
00:48:51,698 --> 00:48:53,742
Aren't you going to help
your mom with the work?

742
00:48:54,993 --> 00:48:56,077
Shh...

743
00:48:56,077 --> 00:48:57,829
I can help.
What do you want me do do?

744
00:48:57,871 --> 00:49:01,624
Keep drawing, keep drawing,
keep drawing, my daughter. Keep drawing.

745
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,671
Hi, girls.

746
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:09,673
Hi, Mr. Carlos.

747
00:49:09,673 --> 00:49:12,384
-Hi.
-What do you want in my fridge?

748
00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:15,845
-I want a Guaraná.
-Guaraná.

749
00:49:21,768 --> 00:49:24,770
Did you have fun at the club?
-It was really hot, right?

750
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:27,357
Very hot.
-It's about to rain a lot.

751
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,525
-Thank you.
-It's hot.

752
00:49:31,193 --> 00:49:32,486
Mister, come see.

753
00:49:32,778 --> 00:49:36,031
-She's very good at drawing.
-No, I already told you it's not done, Edna.

754
00:49:36,031 --> 00:49:37,741
Let me see, let me see.

755
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:38,992
Let me see.

756
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:41,536
-Look, it's not done yet.
-Look at that.

757
00:49:42,995 --> 00:49:45,290
Very good. Did you
take any classes?

758
00:49:45,707 --> 00:49:47,834
-No, I didn't.
-That's why you draw well.

759
00:49:50,085 --> 00:49:51,753
Let's go see my studio.

760
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,297
Can she go, Val?

761
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:56,884
-Let's go.
-Can I?

762
00:49:58,301 --> 00:49:59,344
Let's go?

763
00:50:00,178 --> 00:50:01,597
Val, can you serve lunch?

764
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,765
Yes, sir. I'll do that now.

765
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:09,896
You're in trouble.

766
00:50:10,438 --> 00:50:13,107
One time I spent six
months with one pallet.

767
00:50:13,816 --> 00:50:15,359
To create each color like that?

768
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,237
-Yes, to come up with these colors.
-it's very beautiful.

769
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:21,073
-Beautiful?
-Very.

770
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,744
It's a pity you have it stored away.
You have to hang it on a wall.

771
00:50:26,578 --> 00:50:27,787
Put it on yours.

772
00:50:28,121 --> 00:50:30,248
-Really?
-Yes.

773
00:50:30,248 --> 00:50:32,750
Did you like it?
-This one?

774
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,668
Yeah.

775
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:36,254
-I'm giving it to you as a present.
-It is too lovely.

776
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:38,840
-For me?
-Yes.

777
00:50:39,382 --> 00:50:41,008
How am I going to carry this?

778
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:43,093
You have to use Dante's car.

779
00:50:43,135 --> 00:50:44,762
Thank you.

780
00:50:45,637 --> 00:50:48,932
Wow, I don't know
how I'm to wrap this so.

781
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:50,642
I'll help you.

782
00:50:51,518 --> 00:50:53,562
I fell in love with this one.

783
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:55,939
-Yeah?
You fell in love?

784
00:50:56,689 --> 00:50:57,774
Very beautiful.

785
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,528
And why did you stop painting?

786
00:51:03,946 --> 00:51:06,616
I stopped painting because
I stopped smoking.

787
00:51:08,117 --> 00:51:09,535
No, I'm just kidding.

788
00:51:11,204 --> 00:51:13,289
There are some more pictures here.

789
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,123
I think there are pictures of your mom.

790
00:51:19,752 --> 00:51:20,795
Here, it's Val.

791
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:26,300
Awesome.

792
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,639
She looks like those babysitters
in advertisements, looking so nice.

793
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:34,142
I stopped because

794
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:36,686
everyone said I was
the best, you know?

795
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,478
And I believed them.

796
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:43,650
I don't know,
a lot of things happened,

797
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,736
I ended up stopping to paint.
-You stopped working?

798
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:49,322
How do you get money?
Does Barbara provide for you?

799
00:51:49,322 --> 00:51:51,449
-Barbara provides for us?
-It's not?

800
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:52,825
Uh-uh.

801
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:55,786
I know it doesn't look like it
but the cash is mine.

802
00:51:56,162 --> 00:51:58,330
My dad worked a lot,
saved lots of cash,

803
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:00,166
and I inherited it.

804
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:04,211
Everyone dances,
because I choose the music.

805
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,840
Excuse me.

806
00:52:09,507 --> 00:52:10,508
Hi, Val.

807
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:13,845
I already set the table for lunch.

808
00:52:14,512 --> 00:52:15,931
Can Jessica have lunch with me?

809
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,558
-Jessica?
-Yeah.

810
00:52:19,976 --> 00:52:23,104
-Are you the one inviting her?
-Of course I am inviting her.

811
00:52:24,564 --> 00:52:27,900
Can you put another plate on the table?
-Yes sir.

812
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,401
Sorry?
-Yes sir.

813
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:30,611
Oh, Ok.

814
00:52:30,778 --> 00:52:34,740
Ah, and don't tell her I am smoking
on my job or I'll be in trouble. You know.

815
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,283
No worries. No worries.

816
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:39,369
Later we'll return.

817
00:52:39,702 --> 00:52:40,870
We'll come back.

818
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:52,256
Have you been there? No?

819
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:59,304
Now I think it has eleven,
twelve, thirteen stories.

820
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:03,308
And it's the  superintendency of
the development of the northeast.

821
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:05,476
And it's a building that

822
00:53:05,518 --> 00:53:07,562
is very similar to Copan, I think.

823
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:11,649
It is a bit modernistic

824
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:13,401
I'd like to see Copan.

825
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:15,569
Yeah, we need to go.
Let's go there.

826
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:17,405
-Let's go?
-Of course.

827
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:18,990
Of course. You have to see it.

828
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:23,243
You have to see that
one about the movement.

829
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:27,414
Val?

830
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:29,081
Yes?

831
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,459
-Val?
-I'm going.

832
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:38,883
Will you clear the table?

833
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:40,426
It was very good, wasn't it?

834
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,931
Let me help you.

835
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,351
No, no, no, let Val clear the table.
No, no, Val clears it.

836
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,109
The Sugar loaf Mountain,
have you been there?

837
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,610
No, just pictures.

838
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,783
Will you bring a coffee for us, Val?

839
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:07,535
Are there any sweets, Val?

840
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,620
Bring an ice cream.

841
00:54:19,087 --> 00:54:20,421
What do you think?

842
00:54:20,797 --> 00:54:22,215
Wonderful.

843
00:54:25,426 --> 00:54:27,720
Although I find it a bit strange.

844
00:54:36,686 --> 00:54:39,982
-It's very good. It's very good.
-Very good.

845
00:54:43,068 --> 00:54:44,111
Thank you Val.

846
00:54:44,277 --> 00:54:46,154
Oh, Val, it's not this one.

847
00:54:46,237 --> 00:54:48,865
It's that one, the one
that's almond chocolate.

848
00:54:48,906 --> 00:54:50,324
Fabinho's?

849
00:54:50,575 --> 00:54:53,244
It's not Fabinho's.
It's ours, it's Jessica's,

850
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,996
the other one. Almond chocolate.

851
00:54:55,996 --> 00:54:59,708
-Fabinho's ice cream?
-The almond chocolate ice cream.

852
00:55:03,504 --> 00:55:07,591
-Have you been there? Brasilia.
-Yes, Brasilia is very nice.

853
00:55:10,928 --> 00:55:13,387
Now when Fabinho wants
the ice cream,

854
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:21,979
-The bean broth was excellent.
-There's no way to eat without beans.

855
00:55:22,772 --> 00:55:24,106
Let me serve, Val.

856
00:55:26,149 --> 00:55:27,526
Look how beautiful.

857
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:29,320
It looks tasty.

858
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:30,946
This is mine.

859
00:55:31,405 --> 00:55:32,447
Thank you.

860
00:55:33,907 --> 00:55:35,450
-Is it this one?
-No, let me serve.

861
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,550
Did you ever eat this before?

862
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,970
Never. not in this little container.

863
00:56:15,237 --> 00:56:16,446
Are there no sweets?

864
00:56:16,822 --> 00:56:18,657
She asked  "Are there no sweets?"

865
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:20,701
Are there no sweets?

866
00:56:20,992 --> 00:56:23,703
She doesn't even get up
when you go in the kitchen.

867
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:25,247
Edna.

868
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:27,748
Please. I'm the one talking about Jessica.

869
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:31,586
It's not for you to talk about Jessica,
I'm talking about Jessica.

870
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:34,923
"Are there no sweets?"

871
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,260
And bla bla bla.
Nobody deserves that.

872
00:56:39,635 --> 00:56:44,598
Visit I don't know what,
I don't know what else, with Dr.Carlos.

873
00:56:44,723 --> 00:56:46,391
It's like she doesn't...

874
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:49,477
...have any notion
about anything in this life.

875
00:56:52,188 --> 00:56:53,231
Gosh!

876
00:56:54,023 --> 00:56:55,108
Gosh!

877
00:56:56,318 --> 00:56:58,069
Edna!

878
00:56:58,611 --> 00:56:59,612
Look at that.

879
00:57:00,279 --> 00:57:01,906
I went with so much force that

880
00:57:02,322 --> 00:57:06,827
You're very nervous. Let me fix it.

881
00:57:07,495 --> 00:57:08,787
These old stuff.

882
00:57:09,788 --> 00:57:12,540
The hallway...there's the dining room,

883
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,626
the bigger room, you see?

884
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:17,545
The things here of this floor.

885
00:57:17,796 --> 00:57:18,838
Over here.

886
00:57:18,922 --> 00:57:21,258
And down over here,

887
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,135
in the inferior is your room,

888
00:57:25,052 --> 00:57:27,013
And why is this called a plant?

889
00:57:29,932 --> 00:57:30,975
Good question.

890
00:57:32,643 --> 00:57:34,603
I don't know.
-You don't know?

891
00:57:35,104 --> 00:57:37,480
-No.
-But is that what you want to do?

892
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,900
-Yeah, more or less.
-Val?

893
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:42,653
It's not just this.

894
00:57:42,653 --> 00:57:44,445
-Val?
-I'm going.

895
00:57:48,074 --> 00:57:50,493
Will you clean the table, please?

896
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:53,287
Val, will you bring
the ice cream, please?

897
00:58:17,184 --> 00:58:18,685
Can you give me a little bit, Val?

898
00:58:19,478 --> 00:58:20,980
This ice cream is Fabinho's.

899
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:23,148
But he said I could have some.

900
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:25,358
When they say that,

901
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,694
when they offer something
that is theirs,

902
00:58:28,028 --> 00:58:29,362
it's out of politeness.

903
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:31,281
It's because they're sure

904
00:58:31,615 --> 00:58:33,324
that we're going to say no.

905
00:58:38,746 --> 00:58:39,789
Thank you.

906
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:44,585
-Do you want mine?
-No.

907
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:55,095
If you're going to have ice cream,
eat this one, that's ours.

908
00:59:32,838 --> 00:59:34,924
It's very impressive, isn't it?

909
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:40,221
it seems like the buildings
don't end. We keep looking there,

910
00:59:44,182 --> 00:59:46,142
But there is something
that I am thinking

911
00:59:46,184 --> 00:59:48,269
that I found very awesome
in the television,

912
00:59:49,521 --> 00:59:50,730
It was a show that talked about

913
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,441
the possibility

914
00:59:53,733 --> 00:59:55,442
of us not existing anymore.

915
00:59:56,611 --> 00:59:59,405
And then it said that
in one-hundred years

916
00:59:59,405 --> 01:00:01,282
everything would be taken
over by jungles.

917
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,909
Everything would be back

918
01:00:04,326 --> 01:00:06,453
and I keep thinking about it.

919
01:00:06,453 --> 01:00:08,497
I think that's interesting.

920
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,294
-One-hundred years?
-It's a small amount of time, isn't it?

921
01:00:15,128 --> 01:00:17,422
I don't know if it was one-hundred.
I don't remember.

922
01:00:22,259 --> 01:00:24,803
Thank you for the trip. I really liked it.

923
01:00:24,845 --> 01:00:26,180
No problem.

924
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,023
I'm sorry, Jose Carlos.

925
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,318
I'm sorry.

926
01:00:45,656 --> 01:00:46,657
Hello?

927
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:48,784
Hi.

928
01:00:49,285 --> 01:00:50,327
Hi Janaina.

929
01:00:51,662 --> 01:00:52,663
What?

930
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:55,708
But what...is it serious?

931
01:00:56,667 --> 01:00:57,918
But what happened?

932
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:00,837
Ok. Is she alright?

933
01:01:02,505 --> 01:01:03,715
Ok. I'll be right there.

934
01:01:06,343 --> 01:01:07,886
Barbara had an accident.

935
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:11,348
-Was it serious?
-It doesn't seem so. It seems she's Ok.

936
01:01:11,348 --> 01:01:14,600
-No, we're going. Of course.
- I have to go there

937
01:01:22,357 --> 01:01:23,692
Barbara hit her head.

938
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:25,819
She hurt her forehead?

939
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:27,696
-Holy Mary.
-And her shoulder?

940
01:01:28,321 --> 01:01:29,698
She hurt her forehead.

941
01:01:29,698 --> 01:01:32,408
Her forehead and her shoulder,
and they said she was nervous...

942
01:01:33,117 --> 01:01:34,410
Mrs. Barbara is nervous?

943
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:36,579
Yeah, she hit her car, right?

944
01:01:37,538 --> 01:01:40,124
It scared her.
-What a scare, oh, my god.

945
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:48,381
What do they do to keep
the water so clean, Val?

946
01:01:48,632 --> 01:01:51,010
Don't keep looking at that pool, Jessica.

947
01:01:51,218 --> 01:01:53,136
That's not for you.
-I didn't say anything.

948
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,013
You didn't say anything but
you thought something, I know.

949
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:57,224
You hear me?

950
01:01:58,433 --> 01:02:00,017
You never swam here before?

951
01:02:00,685 --> 01:02:03,562
I am going to swim at someone
else's pool in someone else's house?

952
01:02:05,147 --> 01:02:07,441
-Never?
-Never.

953
01:02:07,566 --> 01:02:10,069
And if one day the ask you

954
01:02:10,152 --> 01:02:14,239
to swim in this pool you'll say "I have
no bathing suit, I can't." Understand?

955
01:02:14,448 --> 01:02:17,034
-I understand.
-Hey, val.

956
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,452
Val!

957
01:02:19,494 --> 01:02:21,871
Don't do that, Skull. Ow, Skull

958
01:02:22,247 --> 01:02:23,707
Get out of there with that hair!

959
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:28,085
That hairy dude is Skull.
Go comb your hair to talk to my daughter.

960
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,171
-How are you?
-It's Jessica.

961
01:02:32,089 --> 01:02:34,425
-Nice to meet you.
-Are we going to swim or what?

962
01:02:34,675 --> 01:02:36,760
That boy's got nothing in his head.

963
01:02:38,012 --> 01:02:40,263
How about you, Jessica?
You're not going in?

964
01:02:40,305 --> 01:02:41,723
It's very good.

965
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:43,683
I have no bathing suit.

966
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:51,524
-Come in with those clothes, Jessica.
-No, I'm wearing clothes.

967
01:02:53,442 --> 01:02:55,611
I think your mom is coming.

968
01:02:55,778 --> 01:02:57,029
It's Mrs. Barbara.

969
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,823
Go away!

970
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:03,201
Stop, stop, stop.

971
01:03:03,327 --> 01:03:06,455
Stop, stop, no. No! Stop!

972
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:29,059
-You want to sit up a bit more, right?
-Yes.

973
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:33,771
-Who's in the pool? Fabinho?
-Fabinho and Skull.

974
01:03:33,771 --> 01:03:36,315
-Oh, Ok.
-Them both, the both of them.

975
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,652
But there is someone else;
who is it? Jessica?

976
01:03:40,861 --> 01:03:44,657
No, Jessica is only there waiting
for me. She was just looking.

977
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:47,160
But...I'm going to see
what this racket is.

978
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,619
Excuse me.

979
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:50,496
Go away! No!

980
01:03:50,913 --> 01:03:52,998
Stop that!
-Jessica!

981
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:55,042
Get out of there, Jessica!

982
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,711
Jessica, get out of there, now.

983
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:01,882
Dr. Carlos is here, Jessica.

984
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:03,008
Fabinho!

985
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:05,843
Jessica. I don't know what
she's thinking. to go in...

986
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,345
I'm going there, Dr.Carlos.

987
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,223
Look at the contractors
there looking. Fabinho!

988
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:13,350
Carlos?

989
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,311
Carlos, help me.

990
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:18,480
Jose Carlos, help me!

991
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,066
Oh, Fabinho!

992
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,486
What a stupid prank, Fabinho.

993
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,364
Take her out of there.
-Jessica, get out of there!

994
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:29,198
Get out of there!
-I'm going!

995
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,199
Get out, Jessica!

996
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,036
Can you obey your mother?
She's talking to you.

997
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,038
-Get out if that water!
-Obey your mother.

998
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,205
She's going to catch a cold.

999
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,624
Obey Dr.Carlos, Mrs.Barbara.

1000
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,709
-I'm going.
-Have you lost your mind?

1001
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,711
Get out of that pool.

1002
01:04:45,505 --> 01:04:46,632
Jessica!

1003
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:49,384
Look.

1004
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,594
-I'm going, Val.
-You are taking too long.

1005
01:04:52,804 --> 01:04:55,098
Come, come...come!

1006
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:57,558
-You don't need to grab me like that.
-Come, Jessica!

1007
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,186
I'm going to get the towel.
Where's the towel?

1008
01:05:00,227 --> 01:05:03,355
Wait, you're naked. Are you crazy?
-Fabinho?

1009
01:05:03,355 --> 01:05:06,233
Fabinho! Get out of there,
I want to talk to you.

1010
01:05:06,275 --> 01:05:08,235
Mom, you're humiliating me.
-Now, Fabinho.

1011
01:05:08,235 --> 01:05:10,237
-Dad, look...
-Now, Fabinho!

1012
01:05:10,237 --> 01:05:12,072
-Listen to your mother, Fabinho.
-I'm going.

1013
01:05:12,322 --> 01:05:13,573
Are you drugged?
Did you smoke today?

1014
01:05:13,573 --> 01:05:15,074
Drugged? What are
you taking about?

1015
01:05:15,074 --> 01:05:17,618
What am I talking about?
Fabinho, I was in an accident.

1016
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:18,829
Did you know that?

1017
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:21,331
That I was unconscious?
That the ambulance took me to the hospital?

1018
01:05:21,373 --> 01:05:24,584
I'm all busted?
-but the doctor said that everything's OK.

1019
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:27,086
Is that why you don't
even come to see me, Fabinho?

1020
01:05:27,169 --> 01:05:29,088
You don't even come to see me, man.

1021
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:30,798
You don't care one bit about me.

1022
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:32,508
You don't even come see me.

1023
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,593
Calm down, mom.

1024
01:05:34,677 --> 01:05:36,845
Calm down? Calm down is great.
It's terrible.

1025
01:05:42,558 --> 01:05:44,686
-May I go?
-yes, you can.

1026
01:05:45,561 --> 01:05:47,021
-Ok, bye.

1027
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:54,278
Do you have Carlos from
the pool's phone number there?

1028
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:55,571
Call him, please.

1029
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:02,369
Do you have it in your phone?
-Yes.

1030
01:06:02,952 --> 01:06:04,954
Give it to me. I'm
going to talk to him.

1031
01:06:04,996 --> 01:06:06,081
Press Talk.

1032
01:06:12,378 --> 01:06:13,421
Claudio?

1033
01:06:14,255 --> 01:06:16,341
Hi, it's Barbara from the Morumbi.

1034
01:06:18,343 --> 01:06:20,594
I know. But I need
you to come tomorrow. Can you?

1035
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:24,056
Yeah, something went wrong here.

1036
01:06:25,557 --> 01:06:28,101
Go on, Maggie. Stop with that sniffing.

1037
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:36,151
Poop quicker, Maggie.

1038
01:06:36,234 --> 01:06:38,653
Today, I don't have any
patience even for you, you hear?

1039
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:48,287
But you did everything
to make him throw you in the pool.

1040
01:06:48,662 --> 01:06:51,457
You weren't even looking, Val.
You don't know what you're saying.

1041
01:06:52,165 --> 01:06:54,418
I'm telling you I want to leave
this place, you understand?

1042
01:06:54,418 --> 01:06:57,253
-it is better if you do.
-Didn't I say that since the beginning?

1043
01:06:57,295 --> 01:06:59,714
-This is not working.
-It really isn't.

1044
01:06:59,756 --> 01:07:00,840
And I told you so.

1045
01:07:01,465 --> 01:07:03,301
I don't know where you
learned these things.

1046
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:05,678
You keep saying "You can't this,
you can't that"

1047
01:07:05,678 --> 01:07:08,181
Was it ever written in a book or
something? How is it? Who taught you?

1048
01:07:08,723 --> 01:07:11,350
When you arrived here were
they explaining these things to you?

1049
01:07:17,647 --> 01:07:20,442
Those things people don't need to explain.
People are born knowing it.

1050
01:07:20,525 --> 01:07:22,027
What you can do and what you can't.

1051
01:07:22,152 --> 01:07:24,529
You seem like you're from another planet.
-I know.

1052
01:07:24,613 --> 01:07:26,197
We are born knowing it.

1053
01:07:27,198 --> 01:07:29,742
-How are you?
-I'm good, dear.

1054
01:07:30,035 --> 01:07:31,869
-What's up?
-So, did you find out the price

1055
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:33,162
of that room in Campo Limpo?

1056
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:35,956
I already talked to them, Ok?
I talked to Adneia,

1057
01:07:35,956 --> 01:07:37,750
and everything is alright.

1058
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,251
Isn't the price good? -400.

1059
01:07:39,376 --> 01:07:41,879
It's great.
We're going now, right Val?

1060
01:07:41,879 --> 01:07:44,631
Ok. It's actually better.
Tomorrow I'm coming.

1061
01:07:44,673 --> 01:07:47,092
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, because things aren't working out there.

1062
01:07:47,217 --> 01:07:49,636
-Why? Want happened?
-You can't imagine.

1063
01:07:49,636 --> 01:07:52,138
-Nothing.
-I'll tell you later. She went to the pool...

1064
01:07:52,138 --> 01:07:53,222
-Let's go, Val.
-Holy moly.

1065
01:07:53,222 --> 01:07:55,308
At Mrs. Barbara's pool?

1066
01:07:55,475 --> 01:07:58,520
Later you come here, Val. For us to talk.
-Raimunda I'm almost going crazy.

1067
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,562
Ok, Bye.

1068
01:08:41,601 --> 01:08:43,353
So let's do this: I'll take the pictures,
I'll choose the best ones

1069
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:48,608
-Ok.
-Because I don't want you tiring yourself now..

1070
01:08:48,608 --> 01:08:50,068
You have to look beautiful and marvelous.
-Ok.

1071
01:08:50,276 --> 01:08:53,279
-Mrs. Barbara, we're leaving.
-Ok.

1072
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,405
You decided to find
your own place to stay.

1073
01:08:55,405 --> 01:08:58,950
-Technically.
-Ok. Did you leave the pie?

1074
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:00,202
Yes, ma'am.

1075
01:09:01,077 --> 01:09:04,122
-Thank you very much, Ok?
-You're welcome.

1076
01:09:04,122 --> 01:09:06,917
So we're leaving. Excuse me.

1077
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:09,544
Good luck on the college admission test.

1078
01:09:15,132 --> 01:09:19,095
-So, let's continue.
-Dr. Carlos...

1079
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:20,513
Hi.

1080
01:09:21,639 --> 01:09:22,640
Thank you.

1081
01:09:23,098 --> 01:09:24,141
Good luck.

1082
01:09:25,142 --> 01:09:26,185
It was a pleasure.

1083
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:27,811
Pleasure.

1084
01:09:28,145 --> 01:09:29,146
Ok let me...

1085
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:34,984
-No, Dr. Carlos, for the love of God.
-No, have a little treat. Please.

1086
01:09:35,026 --> 01:09:37,487
For the love of God,
I'm going to be embarrassed.

1087
01:09:37,528 --> 01:09:39,823
-No worries.
-Thank you.

1088
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:42,783
-See you later.
-Bye.

1089
01:09:42,992 --> 01:09:44,076
Bye.

1090
01:09:54,586 --> 01:09:56,796
-Is everything Ok over there?
-Uh-huh.

1091
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,341
Here, guys, come on in...

1092
01:10:01,175 --> 01:10:03,261
Take a quick glance.

1093
01:10:03,303 --> 01:10:05,388
-Is it here?
-Yes, here.

1094
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:07,974
That's strange, this doesn't
look like a home.

1095
01:10:08,015 --> 01:10:10,184
Is this a person's house?
It is more like a parlor.

1096
01:10:10,225 --> 01:10:14,813
Yeah, it used to be a parlor before,
but the person who lived here made a little parlor.
There's even this huge mirror.

1097
01:10:14,855 --> 01:10:19,109
Raimunda, I think these walls are
too red. Don't you think it's a bit showy?

1098
01:10:19,109 --> 01:10:20,985
It's not. That's what makes it pretty.

1099
01:10:20,985 --> 01:10:24,364
-Just paint it, Val.
-You think so, Jessica?

1100
01:10:24,364 --> 01:10:27,367
-Yes, you can paint it.
-Look here. There is this window

1101
01:10:27,408 --> 01:10:29,577
that brings this fresh air every afternoon,

1102
01:10:29,577 --> 01:10:32,663
And it's also gated. It is totally secured.

1103
01:10:32,914 --> 01:10:36,708
The shower is brand new,
and it's also very good.

1104
01:10:37,418 --> 01:10:38,794
Yeah, we're going to stay.

1105
01:10:39,003 --> 01:10:40,253
-Ok.
-Did you like it?

1106
01:10:40,587 --> 01:10:41,713
It's good, Val.

1107
01:10:42,006 --> 01:10:43,215
We'll make do.

1108
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:45,425
Let's talk to Pedro downstairs.

1109
01:10:45,466 --> 01:10:47,385
Talk nicely, and I
think it will work out.

1110
01:10:47,385 --> 01:10:49,220
Let's go talk to him.
We'll talk nicely to him.

1111
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,472
I said that I wanted...
Just a moment, Raimunda,

1112
01:10:51,472 --> 01:10:53,725
didn't you tell him that I was
working it out?

1113
01:10:53,808 --> 01:10:56,227
I thought everything had worked out.
Raimunda, look.

1114
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:59,146
-The problem is that
there was no deposit, understand?

1115
01:10:59,146 --> 01:11:01,648
Deposit for what if
I didn't see the house?

1116
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,650
How is someone going to deposit money

1117
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:06,403
if there is no one home?
-Ok, let's do this:

1118
01:11:06,403 --> 01:11:07,737
I'm going to turn things around

1119
01:11:07,737 --> 01:11:10,406
-I am going to find you a house.
-Is there something to see today?

1120
01:11:10,449 --> 01:11:13,159
-Not today, but...
-I waned to stay here already.

1121
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,161
Let me stay at your house today, Bruna.

1122
01:11:15,245 --> 01:11:17,622
But this week? This week?
Edimilson is coming today.

1123
01:11:18,748 --> 01:11:20,416
-It's only for tonight that I'm asking.
-I can't.

1124
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:23,711
Edmilson only has one free day each week,
it's just for tonight.

1125
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:26,171
He only has one free day.
He's arriving.

1126
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:28,299
Calm down, Jessica.
-I didn't want to go back there.

1127
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:31,051
It's only for one week, Jessica.

1128
01:11:31,093 --> 01:11:33,387
-We had agreed to stay here already.
-It will be over soon.

1129
01:11:33,429 --> 01:11:35,472
-Are they treating you bad?
-No, it's not this.

1130
01:11:35,472 --> 01:11:38,808
Dr. Carlos? Fabinho?
Do you have a crush on Fabinho?

1131
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:42,020
-I'm not saying that.
-Dr. Carlos is even cherishing her.

1132
01:11:42,103 --> 01:11:43,979
Carlos?

1133
01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:46,774
José Carlos!

1134
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:47,942
Yes?

1135
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:54,824
Her gracious little daughter is back.

1136
01:11:58,201 --> 01:11:59,286
Right, Val?

1137
01:11:59,411 --> 01:12:01,830
Yes, Uh, Dr. Carlos?

1138
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:03,874
it's only for one week.

1139
01:12:03,915 --> 01:12:05,542
Val, there's no problem at all.

1140
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:07,126
I thank you so much, but

1141
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,253
I gave my word.

1142
01:12:09,295 --> 01:12:12,131
You stay as long as
you need, no problem.

1143
01:12:12,423 --> 01:12:13,465
Thank you.

1144
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:16,510
-It won't be for long, Mrs. Barbara.
-Oh, Ok.

1145
01:12:17,136 --> 01:12:19,972
Hey, you know what I saw in the pool?

1146
01:12:19,972 --> 01:12:21,348
A rat, Val.
-No

1147
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:22,974
-Can you believe it?
-Really, Mrs. Barbara?

1148
01:12:22,974 --> 01:12:25,101
A rat. I screamed from up here.

1149
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:32,442
You came back.

1150
01:12:35,028 --> 01:12:37,780
The room didn't work out?
-No, it didn't.

1151
01:12:42,702 --> 01:12:43,827
Do you want one?

1152
01:12:44,286 --> 01:12:46,037
I have one here already.

1153
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:57,090
You know this house here is

1154
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:01,010
almost as if it were yours

1155
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:04,555
Anything that you'll need

1156
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,017
The house even got a bit

1157
01:13:09,143 --> 01:13:10,936
empty, you know?

1158
01:13:15,232 --> 01:13:16,275
Thank you.

1159
01:13:18,235 --> 01:13:20,695
Do you believe in reincarnation?

1160
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:27,201
I don't know.

1161
01:13:27,952 --> 01:13:30,580
I never thought much about it.
-I don't believe it, I don't  believe it

1162
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,165
because It think it's only this time,
you know?

1163
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:36,835
So...

1164
01:13:37,545 --> 01:13:39,880
sometimes we say
things that may seem

1165
01:13:40,505 --> 01:13:43,675
crazy, you know?
But if I don't say it,

1166
01:13:45,468 --> 01:13:48,388
Maybe it is crazy if we
only have this one time.

1167
01:13:48,847 --> 01:13:49,889
You know? Uh...

1168
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:57,312
Do you want to marry me?

1169
01:14:05,403 --> 01:14:06,863
Marry me.

1170
01:14:08,073 --> 01:14:09,407
I'll take you anywhere you want.

1171
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,205
Uh...

1172
01:14:25,089 --> 01:14:26,339
It's hot, isn't it?

1173
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:32,554
Sorry, José Carlos.

1174
01:14:33,429 --> 01:14:35,182
-No, I'm sorry.
-I don't know what to say.

1175
01:14:35,765 --> 01:14:36,766
It's yes.

1176
01:14:37,267 --> 01:14:38,309
Say yes.

1177
01:14:39,811 --> 01:14:40,853
Say yes.

1178
01:14:42,772 --> 01:14:44,440
Marry me.
-No,

1179
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,109
-Sorry. I am...
-I don't...

1180
01:14:48,193 --> 01:14:50,278
I don't understand.
-I'm sorry, it's...

1181
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:53,281
I was just kidding.
I was kidding.

1182
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:57,035
-You were kidding?
-I was kidding. It was a joke.

1183
01:14:57,453 --> 01:15:02,040
-Wow, you scared me.
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1184
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,636
She's coming to São Paulo,

1185
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:20,391
she never comes, and
since Jessica has vacated the guest room,

1186
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,767
I told her she could stay here
in my house, so

1187
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:23,977
she is coming

1188
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:27,105
and I will need you to
help Jessica move to your room.

1189
01:15:27,313 --> 01:15:28,731
-Of course.
-Ok?

1190
01:15:28,773 --> 01:15:30,733
She will go to my room

1191
01:15:30,775 --> 01:15:32,985
Great. Tell her to leave the room today.

1192
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:34,904
-Yes ma'am
-Then it will be enough time to

1193
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:37,489
organize everything.

1194
01:15:37,657 --> 01:15:39,825
-Don't worry.
-Ok, thank you, Val.

1195
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:42,745
But tell her to leave the room today, Ok?

1196
01:15:42,787 --> 01:15:44,789
-Ok, yes ma'am.
-Alright, thank you.

1197
01:15:44,789 --> 01:15:46,789
Let me go, because I've
got a pot on the range.

1198
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:17,652
Can't you open the window, Val?

1199
01:16:18,403 --> 01:16:20,321
If I open the window, It'll be
as hot, the only thing that

1200
01:16:20,363 --> 01:16:22,198
it'll do is bring
in more mosquitoes.

1201
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:24,909
Sincerely, Val,
I don't know how you can stand it.

1202
01:16:27,662 --> 01:16:28,871
How I stand what?

1203
01:16:29,913 --> 01:16:32,625
To be treated this way,
like a second-class citizen.

1204
01:16:33,334 --> 01:16:34,710
This is worse than India.

1205
01:16:35,294 --> 01:16:37,755
Don't go talking this
difficult subject of India,

1206
01:16:37,796 --> 01:16:39,714
because you are snobby,
that's what you are.

1207
01:16:39,757 --> 01:16:43,134
-This is all too shitty, that's what it is.
-Stop swearing.

1208
01:16:43,176 --> 01:16:45,261
Because I don't like swearing.

1209
01:16:47,763 --> 01:16:49,223
You think you're all that.

1210
01:16:49,265 --> 01:16:51,517
You think you're better than
everyone, you are

1211
01:16:51,559 --> 01:16:55,395
superior to everyone.
-I don't think I'm superior, Val,
I just don't think I'm inferior, understand?

1212
01:16:55,729 --> 01:16:58,732
It's different.
-You are going to make me lose this job.

1213
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:02,695
-Oh, fuck it.
-Watch your language.
Go wash your mouth with soap.

1214
01:17:02,903 --> 01:17:04,988
Respect me because I'm your mother.

1215
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:07,698
-Oh, no, you're not my mom.
-Sandra is the one who raised me.

1216
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:10,452
You have nothing to do with this.
Look down. Sandra raised you

1217
01:17:10,452 --> 01:17:12,787
with the money I sent her
every month

1218
01:17:12,787 --> 01:17:14,998
to pay for your school, pay
for your dentist...

1219
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:16,541
Sandra got the easy part.

1220
01:17:16,582 --> 01:17:18,960
Sandra was with you,

1221
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:21,795
and I was here, only working,
working hard.

1222
01:17:22,379 --> 01:17:24,256
Sandra is your mom,

1223
01:17:24,423 --> 01:17:28,677
Sandra is...Sandra's bill, you
know who sent her money every month.

1224
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:32,096
I'm tired, you know?

1225
01:17:32,096 --> 01:17:34,974
Of hearing this kind of thing.

1226
01:17:35,224 --> 01:17:37,394
Tired. Tired.

1227
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,731
No, everything's
alright. I'm studying...

1228
01:17:46,401 --> 01:17:48,779
But let me ask you.

1229
01:17:49,196 --> 01:17:50,280
How is he, huh?

1230
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:54,701
Is he asking about me?

1231
01:17:58,288 --> 01:17:59,372
really?

1232
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:03,626
Wish I'd seen it.

1233
01:18:05,795 --> 01:18:07,922
Look, I'm going to
let you sleep, Ok?

1234
01:18:08,423 --> 01:18:10,174
Later we'll talk more.

1235
01:18:12,676 --> 01:18:14,427
Ok, kisses.

1236
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:23,812
Do you want to smoke?

1237
01:18:25,104 --> 01:18:26,148
Yeah.

1238
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:38,534
This one's one of the good ones.

1239
01:18:46,542 --> 01:18:48,627
They asked to drain out the pool,
did they?

1240
01:18:49,419 --> 01:18:51,963
Yeah. My mom said
she saw a rat here.

1241
01:18:52,839 --> 01:18:55,717
I don't know. It might be
dangerous. We might catch a disease.

1242
01:18:58,594 --> 01:18:59,678
Alright.

1243
01:19:06,184 --> 01:19:07,436
Are you a virgin?

1244
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:13,984
What kind of question is that?

1245
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,154
Do I look like a virgin?

1246
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:20,531
I don't know.

1247
01:19:21,866 --> 01:19:22,867
The look...

1248
01:19:23,326 --> 01:19:25,745
-You look like a virgin.
-Me?

1249
01:19:25,787 --> 01:19:26,912
You do.

1250
01:19:27,288 --> 01:19:28,789
In this face?

1251
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,792
I'm not. Are you?

1252
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:34,252
Of course not.

1253
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,051
You think I'm a rat.

1254
01:19:41,342 --> 01:19:42,719
What?

1255
01:20:06,074 --> 01:20:08,493
-I think I know already.
-Already?

1256
01:20:08,785 --> 01:20:11,287
-You know?
-Ah, I think I know.

1257
01:20:11,329 --> 01:20:13,039
-I don't know.
-You don't?

1258
01:20:13,998 --> 01:20:15,625
I don't get it.

1259
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:29,554
Ah, there.

1260
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:33,600
FAU. -It's FAU.

1261
01:20:33,641 --> 01:20:34,935
Ah...

1262
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:36,811
This is where you'll
be studying, right?

1263
01:20:36,852 --> 01:20:38,521
Yeah.

1264
01:20:38,729 --> 01:20:40,439
I want to, right?

1265
01:20:40,939 --> 01:20:42,316
It's pure town planning.

1266
01:21:13,804 --> 01:21:15,972
I'm going to put Maggie
down there. Come, Maggie.

1267
01:21:16,097 --> 01:21:17,140
Come, Maggie!

1268
01:21:17,974 --> 01:21:18,975
Maggie.

1269
01:21:20,977 --> 01:21:22,479
Come, Maggie.

1270
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:23,688
Come.

1271
01:21:23,938 --> 01:21:27,650
She's must be smelly because
she fell in the pool and didn't dry well.

1272
01:22:19,783 --> 01:22:21,826
That's why Fabinho's
ice cream finishes.

1273
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,791
I already said that this
is Fabinho's ice cream.

1274
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:31,376
You are so stubborn.

1275
01:22:33,503 --> 01:22:35,130
Forgive me for that, Mrs. Barbara.

1276
01:22:37,465 --> 01:22:39,550
I have already said it, and said it again.

1277
01:22:47,057 --> 01:22:49,393
Since when is my great-grandma's
tray broken?

1278
01:22:53,397 --> 01:22:56,316
Val, it may not appear to be,
but this house is still mine.

1279
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,901
Come here.

1280
01:22:58,485 --> 01:23:00,028
I want to talk to you.

1281
01:23:07,285 --> 01:23:10,538
Mrs. Barbara, If you'll tell me
where I can get...

1282
01:23:10,579 --> 01:23:12,998
this silver tray fixed, I’ll take it there

1283
01:23:12,998 --> 01:23:16,460
I'll do everything, pay for everything...
-Val, it's not that.

1284
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,253
Val, that's not it.
That's not the problem.

1285
01:23:20,714 --> 01:23:22,925
The college admission
exam is tomorrow, right?

1286
01:23:22,966 --> 01:23:25,218
-Yes, ma’am.
-After that, she'll leave, right?

1287
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:26,886
She will go, yes, ma'am.

1288
01:23:27,054 --> 01:23:28,513
So while she's still here,

1289
01:23:29,347 --> 01:23:30,389
I'd want you to

1290
01:23:31,266 --> 01:23:34,935
make sure she doesn't pass
the kitchen door, Ok.

1291
01:23:34,935 --> 01:23:37,646
Yes, ma'am. She won't
pass the kitchen door.

1292
01:23:37,689 --> 01:23:39,523
Yes, from the door of the kitchen out.

1293
01:23:39,523 --> 01:23:41,734
You can go, thank you.

1294
01:23:51,117 --> 01:23:55,913
You know she lives far away,
how are you going to get there now?

1295
01:23:55,913 --> 01:23:57,915
You can't leave now.

1296
01:23:58,249 --> 01:24:00,876
-I'll make it work.
-Oh stubborn girl, don't go, Jessica.

1297
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,544
I have no guts for that.

1298
01:24:02,544 --> 01:24:04,338
to endure this.

1299
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:06,841
We'll talk about this later. Tomorrow is
you exam, my daughter.

1300
01:24:06,882 --> 01:24:10,803
I'd rather think about what to
then to keep tolerating this bullshit.

1301
01:24:10,844 --> 01:24:13,389
If you have the guts to stay
here, then stay, but I can't stand it, Val.

1302
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:16,350
I can't stand it.
-You should have defended me!

1303
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:19,478
Jessica, don't go...Don't
go with this rain! Holy Mary!

1304
01:24:19,478 --> 01:24:23,231
-How will you go?
-I'll find a way. I'm not scared of water.

1305
01:24:23,272 --> 01:24:28,111
-Where are you going?
-Let it be, Val, let it be because it's no use!

1306
01:24:28,402 --> 01:24:33,073
-Have you lost your mind?
Who goes out on a storm like this?
-Forget it, Val. Go back home!

1307
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:37,286
Tomorrow's your exam.
You'll miss it, Jessica.

1308
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,996
Good luck, my daughter.

1309
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:44,792
Go with  the boy Jesus on your lap.

1310
01:25:09,732 --> 01:25:12,360
-Let's go? Let's go.
I'm worried.

1311
01:25:12,693 --> 01:25:16,448
What about the traffic? No, no, let's get
going downstairs and I'll call him.

1312
01:25:16,572 --> 01:25:19,950
-At least drink coffee. It's still very early.
-But I think it's better to be early than late.

1313
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:23,787
What if we have an accident or there is traffic,
or something? We'd better go.

1314
01:25:23,829 --> 01:25:25,914
Right? Let's go.

1315
01:25:31,211 --> 01:25:34,005
Did you get a cereal bar or
something else to eat?

1316
01:25:34,047 --> 01:25:35,382
I got. Got it.

1317
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:38,175
Good luck.

1318
01:27:07,509 --> 01:27:08,719
Very difficult.

1319
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,178
But do you think you think you did well?

1320
01:27:10,345 --> 01:27:11,721
We don't know yet.

1321
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:13,723
The answers have been posted.

1322
01:27:13,723 --> 01:27:16,017
-it has been posted already?
-Was it hard?
-yes. Hold on, let me get it here.

1323
01:27:16,017 --> 01:27:18,144
Which one was yours? There's A...

1324
01:27:18,144 --> 01:27:20,647
-it was Q, mom.
-Ok, let me see here.

1325
01:27:20,897 --> 01:27:22,815
And Jessica, Fabinho?
Have you seen Jessica?

1326
01:27:23,148 --> 01:27:25,067
Crap, Val. I don't
have any news about her.

1327
01:27:25,109 --> 01:27:27,278
Let's see? Val, can you excuse us, please?

1328
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:30,823
Ok...Can I start?
-Let's go. You can start.

1329
01:27:30,906 --> 01:27:32,282
-One- C.
-Yeah.

1330
01:27:32,325 --> 01:27:34,410
-Did you get it right?
-Yes.

1331
01:27:34,826 --> 01:27:35,911
-Two - D

1332
01:27:36,327 --> 01:27:37,662
-I got it right.
-Yeah.

1333
01:27:37,662 --> 01:27:39,498
-Three - B,

1334
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:41,791
-Four A,

1335
01:27:42,584 --> 01:27:43,668
No?

1336
01:27:43,668 --> 01:27:45,753
Mom, keep going. In the end, we'll see.
Five A,

1337
01:27:46,588 --> 01:27:47,755
You got nervous.

1338
01:27:49,882 --> 01:27:53,386
You knew all the answers, didn't you?
You got nervous.

1339
01:27:57,014 --> 01:27:58,849
Val, I was two point away.

1340
01:27:58,891 --> 01:28:00,976
That's unfair.

1341
01:28:01,184 --> 01:28:02,227
Let's move on.

1342
01:28:02,519 --> 01:28:03,520
Fabinho,

1343
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,314
Next year, you'll try again.
Excuse me.

1344
01:28:06,606 --> 01:28:09,358
-Look how bad he is.
-You will continue to be like this, son?

1345
01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:12,236
Now there's no use.

1346
01:28:17,867 --> 01:28:18,868
Hey...

1347
01:28:19,952 --> 01:28:21,204
Get your hopes up.

1348
01:28:21,578 --> 01:28:22,621
It's over now.

1349
01:28:27,542 --> 01:28:28,585
Come here.

1350
01:28:37,718 --> 01:28:40,429
Hey, Fabinho...Val can hug you and I can't?

1351
01:28:41,889 --> 01:28:44,266
-Val thinks I'm intelligent.
You think I'm dumb.

1352
01:28:44,558 --> 01:28:47,811
-I don't think you're dumb.
I don't think you're dumb.

1353
01:28:48,354 --> 01:28:49,438
I think maybe...

1354
01:28:50,063 --> 01:28:52,607
You didn't pass because you
don't know what you want...

1355
01:28:53,191 --> 01:28:54,443
You have doubts...

1356
01:28:55,319 --> 01:28:56,778
Excuse me, Mrs. Barbara,

1357
01:28:57,570 --> 01:29:00,573
Mrs. Barbara, I'm so nervous
I can't even talk to you.

1358
01:29:00,615 --> 01:29:03,325
-What happened?
-Holy Mary, Jessica called.

1359
01:29:03,367 --> 01:29:06,412
-Yeah?
-Do you know how many point Jessica got?

1360
01:29:06,412 --> 01:29:07,663
-How many?
-How many?

1361
01:29:07,663 --> 01:29:10,457
Do you know how
many points Jessica got?

1362
01:29:10,874 --> 01:29:12,751
68 points!

1363
01:29:13,127 --> 01:29:16,421
-68?
-Jessica passed the exam.

1364
01:29:17,589 --> 01:29:20,592
-Jessica passed.
-Wow, 68?

1365
01:29:20,592 --> 01:29:22,886
-Look, I'm so nervous.
-Congratulations, Val.

1366
01:29:22,886 --> 01:29:25,138
-Thank you.
-Congratulations, Val.

1367
01:29:25,513 --> 01:29:28,475
-Holy Mary!
-68?

1368
01:29:28,475 --> 01:29:31,310
-I still can't believe it.
-Yeah, I can't believe it, either.

1369
01:29:31,352 --> 01:29:32,603
It's incredible, isn’t it?

1370
01:29:32,728 --> 01:29:36,023
-So...
-Impressive. very good. 68.

1371
01:29:36,023 --> 01:29:39,318
-It's very good.
-She said 68.

1372
01:29:41,612 --> 01:29:42,655
-Val?

1373
01:29:42,738 --> 01:29:46,074
Yeah...don't get too excited.

1374
01:29:46,074 --> 01:29:47,992
It was only the first round.
-I know, yes, ma'am.

1375
01:29:48,034 --> 01:29:50,244
There'll we another exam, the second
round is a lot harder,

1376
01:29:50,287 --> 01:29:52,872
-I can't believe it.
-I know.

1377
01:29:52,956 --> 01:29:54,290
So...

1378
01:29:54,290 --> 01:29:58,461
She said she got 68
points and 68 points is...

1379
01:29:58,461 --> 01:30:01,088
No it's very good, but...she
has to pass the next round.

1380
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:03,591
It won't matter if she doesn't
pass the other round.

1381
01:30:03,965 --> 01:30:06,927
-But if God wants to help,
she'll pass the next round.

1382
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:09,554
-Yes, she will.
-Right, and so will Fabinho for the next year.

1383
01:30:09,595 --> 01:30:12,140
They'll pass, right, Fabinho?

1384
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:15,101
Don't be so sad like that,
my precious.

1385
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:19,021
Well, get your hopes up, Fabinho.

1386
01:30:20,064 --> 01:30:22,566
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1387
01:30:24,818 --> 01:30:26,320
68...

1388
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:29,948
-That's a lot, right?
-Yeah.

1389
01:30:30,323 --> 01:30:31,658
She studied, right?

1390
01:30:34,327 --> 01:30:36,663
She didn't do anything else,
she only studied.

1391
01:30:41,835 --> 01:30:43,712
You have to study to pass.

1392
01:30:44,211 --> 01:30:45,463
You have to study.

1393
01:30:47,506 --> 01:30:48,549
I'm leaving.

1394
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:40,362
Jessica?

1395
01:32:42,572 --> 01:32:43,615
My daughter.

1396
01:32:47,953 --> 01:32:49,287
Hi it's mom.

1397
01:32:49,287 --> 01:32:51,372
I'm calling to say good night.

1398
01:32:55,126 --> 01:32:56,711
I'm calling to say good night.

1399
01:32:57,544 --> 01:33:00,214
To say I'm very proud of you.

1400
01:33:02,258 --> 01:33:03,300
Now...

1401
01:33:04,968 --> 01:33:06,719
Guess where I am.

1402
01:33:09,306 --> 01:33:10,349
Look...

1403
01:33:12,808 --> 01:33:14,143
Can you hear?

1404
01:33:17,146 --> 01:33:18,897
I'm in the pool!

1405
01:33:21,984 --> 01:33:23,026
Yeah.

1406
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:25,863
Yes, I am.

1407
01:33:30,242 --> 01:33:31,410
I'm very happy.

1408
01:33:32,577 --> 01:33:33,661
You hear me?

1409
01:33:34,788 --> 01:33:36,664
A kiss...look...

1410
01:33:40,251 --> 01:33:41,835
Mom loves you.

1411
01:33:44,797 --> 01:33:45,839
A kiss.

1412
01:34:27,545 --> 01:34:29,756
Dr. Carlos, it's eleven O'clock.

1413
01:34:30,548 --> 01:34:32,550
-Come in, Val.
-Excuse  me.

1414
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:42,476
-Have you taken your medicine?
-I did. I want to congratulate you.

1415
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:44,770
for Jessica.
-Goodness.

1416
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:46,813
You raised your daughter very well.

1417
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:48,565
Me?

1418
01:34:55,571 --> 01:34:57,240
I also want...

1419
01:34:59,284 --> 01:35:00,659
To apologize to you.

1420
01:35:01,452 --> 01:35:02,829
Apologize for what?

1421
01:35:04,246 --> 01:35:05,288
You know.

1422
01:35:14,339 --> 01:35:17,092
I'm going...to
stay here a little bit more.

1423
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:20,553
But...

1424
01:35:21,095 --> 01:35:23,848
What can I do? Do you want anything?

1425
01:35:24,098 --> 01:35:25,266
I want to sleep.

1426
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,684
Huh.

1427
01:35:38,778 --> 01:35:41,781
-Tell her the news.
-Didn't I tell you?

1428
01:35:42,532 --> 01:35:44,576
I'm going to live overseas
six months by myself.

1429
01:35:45,743 --> 01:35:47,662
-Overseas? Where?
-in Australia, Val.

1430
01:35:47,662 --> 01:35:50,707
Holy Moly, how far!

1431
01:35:50,748 --> 01:35:52,583
There is an incredible
English school there.

1432
01:35:52,624 --> 01:35:54,293
it's good for him to
stay there, study...

1433
01:35:54,293 --> 01:35:58,297
I didn't like this. I'm going to miss
you very much. Six months without him?

1434
01:35:58,297 --> 01:36:00,507
-Look at this beach here.
-Oh my goodness.

1435
01:36:00,549 --> 01:36:03,301
-Look how pretty.
-Very pretty.

1436
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,720
Yeah, we're still seeing where
he is going to stay...

1437
01:36:05,762 --> 01:36:07,097
It's very far, guys.

1438
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:08,974
Oh my goodness, it's so far...

1439
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,643
-Look.
-It looks like Recife.

1440
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:24,864
Look how cute.

1441
01:36:27,324 --> 01:36:29,784
It's crochet. I bought it from Joelma.

1442
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,912
She lives near Pamela.

1443
01:36:33,246 --> 01:36:35,331
Look at how everything is tidying up.

1444
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,252
God writes straight
with crooked lines.

1445
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:42,213
This house is much better
than that one, isn't it Jessica?

1446
01:36:46,925 --> 01:36:49,094
Jessica, you're still mad at me.

1447
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:52,264
You have to understand my side
of the story, my daughter.

1448
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:53,598
And you should have defended me.

1449
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:54,933
Didn't I defend you?

1450
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:58,854
I'm not going to talk
about this because I don't want to fight again.

1451
01:36:58,854 --> 01:37:00,563
Mother of God.

1452
01:37:08,987 --> 01:37:11,031
They thought you were so pretty.

1453
01:37:12,366 --> 01:37:15,286
All rich, full of things, when you
used to go by and visit.

1454
01:37:17,705 --> 01:37:19,956
They don't know how much
I suffered because of you.

1455
01:37:20,249 --> 01:37:22,709
You don't know how much
I suffered because of you.

1456
01:37:22,709 --> 01:37:24,794
You suffered because you wanted to.

1457
01:37:25,086 --> 01:37:27,130
You always went  there
carrying many presents

1458
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:30,091
telling me this, telling me that,
and then leaving me there like an idiot

1459
01:37:30,133 --> 01:37:33,177
asking "When does my mommy return"
"What time does she return?"

1460
01:37:34,887 --> 01:37:36,388
You don't know half of it.

1461
01:37:36,847 --> 01:37:38,432
One day I asked your dad.

1462
01:37:40,768 --> 01:37:42,894
Fuck that, Val. Ten years!

1463
01:37:43,103 --> 01:37:44,688
Why didn't you come back?

1464
01:37:47,858 --> 01:37:52,236
You don't know what I went through.
The longer I stayed the more I wanted to go back,

1465
01:37:52,487 --> 01:37:55,990
but the time passed and I didn't go back,
but even if I didn't go back...

1466
01:37:57,575 --> 01:37:59,368
I'm going to tell you
something: one day

1467
01:37:59,368 --> 01:38:01,411
God forbid, God forbid,
but one day

1468
01:38:01,496 --> 01:38:03,706
you will understand your mother very much.

1469
01:38:12,172 --> 01:38:13,256
Who is this boy?

1470
01:38:17,677 --> 01:38:19,637
Jessica, I am asking
you who this boy is.

1471
01:38:21,138 --> 01:38:23,766
Jessica, why doesn't your
father speak to you?

1472
01:38:24,308 --> 01:38:26,685
I don't understand why your
father doesn't speak to you.

1473
01:38:30,105 --> 01:38:32,774
Jessica, I'm asking you. Who
is this boy, Jessica?

1474
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,739
It's Jorge.

1475
01:38:39,614 --> 01:38:41,157
I don't know who Jorge is

1476
01:38:45,245 --> 01:38:47,955
-He's my son.
-Oh, my God.

1477
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:50,541
Jessica, I can't believe it, Jessica.

1478
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:53,002
And why didn't you
ever tell me, Jessica?

1479
01:38:53,461 --> 01:38:59,133
-Because we weren't even talking.
How would I tell you something like that?
-And you left the boy there?

1480
01:38:59,382 --> 01:39:04,804
You left the boy there?
-I did, Val. How was I going to study, do the exam?
Would I bring the boy with me?

1481
01:39:04,804 --> 01:39:06,306
Oh, my God.

1482
01:39:07,724 --> 01:39:09,225
And you won't bring the boy?

1483
01:39:09,558 --> 01:39:10,601
Yes, I will.

1484
01:39:12,645 --> 01:39:14,897
As soon as I can I will.
-So cute.

1485
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:17,983
-When?
-When I can, Val.

1486
01:39:22,071 --> 01:39:23,489
-Oh, Thank you, Val.

1487
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:25,991
it's alright.

1488
01:39:26,575 --> 01:39:30,078
Oh, my god, send a a man like this to
that end of the world

1489
01:39:31,329 --> 01:39:33,497
My little boy, my precious.

1490
01:39:34,081 --> 01:39:35,125
Love of mine.

1491
01:39:36,292 --> 01:39:38,336
My boy.
-Let's go, son?

1492
01:39:38,586 --> 01:39:39,628
We're late.

1493
01:39:40,045 --> 01:39:41,088
Ok? Bye, Val.

1494
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:42,965
-Bye bye.
-Kisses.

1495
01:39:42,965 --> 01:39:44,591
Don't eat any junk food.

1496
01:39:45,133 --> 01:39:46,176
Take care.

1497
01:39:46,301 --> 01:39:47,345
Ok, my love?

1498
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:53,433
Love you.

1499
01:40:18,873 --> 01:40:19,874
Oh my.

1500
01:40:53,156 --> 01:40:56,742
-But Val...but why?
Are you mad at me?

1501
01:40:56,742 --> 01:40:58,661
No, I'm asking my resignation.

1502
01:40:58,661 --> 01:40:59,995
I'm resigning.

1503
01:41:00,163 --> 01:41:02,664
But why so sudden?

1504
01:41:02,707 --> 01:41:04,917
Was it something I did?
Are you mad at me?

1505
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:06,626
-No ma'am.
-me?

1506
01:41:06,626 --> 01:41:10,588
No, Mrs. Barbara. It's...
It's not you, it's me.

1507
01:41:11,548 --> 01:41:15,552
Are there being Gossips? is Vandre
the driver whispering things to you?

1508
01:41:15,593 --> 01:41:17,803
No it wasn't Vandre.

1509
01:41:18,763 --> 01:41:19,972
It wasn't, ma'am.

1510
01:41:20,264 --> 01:41:21,265
This is...

1511
01:41:22,891 --> 01:41:24,102
This is my thing.

1512
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,603
I know.

1513
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:27,604
This, Mrs. Barbara,

1514
01:41:27,896 --> 01:41:29,314
Do you want a raise?

1515
01:41:29,356 --> 01:41:30,941
No ma'am, it's not about money.

1516
01:41:30,941 --> 01:41:32,650
We can see. We can get you a raise.

1517
01:41:32,692 --> 01:41:34,778
No, Mrs. Barbara,
it's not because of money.

1518
01:41:34,778 --> 01:41:36,696
No ma'am it's not because of money.

1519
01:41:39,282 --> 01:41:40,450
It's that...

1520
01:41:42,284 --> 01:41:43,578
I think I am...

1521
01:41:46,205 --> 01:41:47,582
I need...

1522
01:41:48,832 --> 01:41:50,459
...to stay with my daughter.

1523
01:41:51,376 --> 01:41:53,962
To take care of my daughter,
to be with my daughter.

1524
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:57,382
Yeah.

1525
01:41:59,259 --> 01:42:00,761
You're right.
-Right?

1526
01:42:03,764 --> 01:42:04,806
Oh, Val.

1527
01:42:09,143 --> 01:42:10,186
Alright.

1528
01:42:11,687 --> 01:42:12,730
Alright.

1529
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:09,741
People'll stay there until 9:30,

1530
01:43:09,783 --> 01:43:11,702
I will lose track of time,
and then, you guessed it,

1531
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:13,870
I have to go to Vila Romana
over there, close by

1532
01:43:13,912 --> 01:43:16,998
go down behind there, cut through it,
go to Moema,

1533
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:19,251
and on top of that I still need
to buy the kids' Christmas presents.

1534
01:43:19,292 --> 01:43:22,128
It's not easy.
-But we need to have hope, Vitor,

1535
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:24,422
what do you intend
on doing next year?

1536
01:43:24,463 --> 01:43:27,508
If I could choose, you know
how it's so hot,

1537
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:30,469
sometimes it rains too much
and I have to close the truck's window,

1538
01:43:30,511 --> 01:43:35,140
and I would like to ask a favor here...

1539
01:43:35,182 --> 01:43:36,266
Here.

1540
01:43:43,065 --> 01:43:44,107
Here.

1541
01:43:46,984 --> 01:43:49,904
-Put this one with the other...
-No, that's Ok.

1542
01:43:50,697 --> 01:43:52,282
-Thank you, Andre.
-Your're welcome.

1543
01:43:52,323 --> 01:43:54,408
-Thank you.
-If you need me, call me.

1544
01:43:54,408 --> 01:43:56,660
Good bye, you two. Wish you the best.
-Bye.

1545
01:44:05,877 --> 01:44:07,754
What are you doing here on a Thursday?

1546
01:44:13,218 --> 01:44:14,260
Goodbye.

1547
01:44:15,595 --> 01:44:16,638
I resigned.

1548
01:44:21,099 --> 01:44:22,768
You're kidding, Val.

1549
01:44:22,768 --> 01:44:25,604
-No. I'm serious.
-Really?

1550
01:44:28,899 --> 01:44:30,775
Not even I can believe it.

1551
01:44:32,611 --> 01:44:33,861
That's not good.

1552
01:44:34,154 --> 01:44:35,822
Go boil some water.

1553
01:44:38,199 --> 01:44:40,076
Now we're going to drink coffee.

1554
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:41,703
Let's.

1555
01:44:44,413 --> 01:44:47,499
And now? Have you
thought about what you're going to do?

1556
01:44:48,959 --> 01:44:50,461
I don't know.

1557
01:44:51,337 --> 01:44:52,629
I'll figure it out.

1558
01:44:57,342 --> 01:44:58,969
I'll do a massage specialization class,

1559
01:45:00,303 --> 01:45:03,306
Doesn't Fabinho say I'm
the best masseuse in the world?

1560
01:45:04,182 --> 01:45:05,266
Who knows?

1561
01:45:08,018 --> 01:45:09,311
It's a good idea.

1562
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,823
Look how beautiful.

1563
01:45:21,156 --> 01:45:22,157
I like it.

1564
01:45:22,198 --> 01:45:24,283
-Modern right?
-I see it.

1565
01:45:24,326 --> 01:45:26,786
All this is different, look.

1566
01:45:26,786 --> 01:45:29,915
The black on the white,
the white on the black,

1567
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:33,459
It's different, like you.

1568
01:45:34,085 --> 01:45:35,128
Beautiful.

1569
01:45:37,588 --> 01:45:39,006
-Modern.
-Yeah.

1570
01:45:41,049 --> 01:45:43,177
Look at thermos, how beautiful.

1571
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:46,346
So beautiful, so beautiful.

1572
01:45:49,474 --> 01:45:50,517
Fancy.

1573
01:45:59,108 --> 01:46:00,359
Why?

1574
01:46:04,363 --> 01:46:05,947
I stole it from Mrs. Barbara.

1575
01:46:06,824 --> 01:46:08,033
You're lying, Val.

1576
01:46:10,202 --> 01:46:11,245
You swear?

1577
01:46:29,261 --> 01:46:30,763
Jessica, now that...

1578
01:46:33,223 --> 01:46:34,600
I spend more time at home,

1579
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,852
that we're home,

1580
01:46:40,438 --> 01:46:41,647
I was thinking.

1581
01:46:49,864 --> 01:46:50,907
Go get Jorge.

1582
01:46:53,993 --> 01:46:55,453
Bring my grandson.

1583
01:46:57,079 --> 01:46:58,413
I'll pay for the trip.

1584
01:47:00,498 --> 01:47:01,583
By plane!

1585
01:47:04,086 --> 01:47:05,212
Go get your son.

1586
01:47:08,298 --> 01:47:09,340
Go.

1587
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:13,094
Aren't you in a hurry?

1588
01:47:13,469 --> 01:47:15,847
You already want to get
ahead of yourself, huh, Val?

1589
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,268
Will you take care of him, mom?
