1
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,501
Think of it, Thing.

2
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:51,505
For 25 years,

3
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:53,507
we've attempted
to contact Fester

4
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,009
in the great beyond,

5
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:57,927
and for 25 years...

6
00:03:58,011 --> 00:03:59,137
nothing.

7
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,889
I'm beginning to think

8
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:04,392
my brother truly is lost.

9
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:15,111
Don't be a baby.

10
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:17,113
I know what I'm doing.

11
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:21,533
Help me.

12
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:36,423
Look at her.

13
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:39,300
I would die for her.

14
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:43,054
I would kill for her.

15
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,930
Either way, what bliss.

16
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:52,980
Unhappy, darling?

17
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:55,691
Oh, yes.

18
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:58,110
Yes, completely.

19
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:06,868
Gomez...

20
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:09,162
sun.

21
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:11,289
Il me perce comme unpoignard.

22
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:14,167
Oh, Tish.

23
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:16,044
That's French.

24
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,712
Oui.

25
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,632
Cara mia.

26
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,596
En garde, Monsieur Soleil!

27
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:30,975
Gomez...

28
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,476
Querida?

29
00:05:32,518 --> 00:05:35,896
Last night you were unhinged.

30
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,149
You were like some
desperate howling demon.

31
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:41,902
You frightened me.

32
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:45,446
Do it again.

33
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:54,163
Thank you, Lurch.

34
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,743
Damn you, Addams!

35
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,745
Sorry about the window, Judge.

36
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,246
Keep the ball.

37
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,373
I have a whole bucketful.

38
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,712
You moron!

39
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:50,717
It is a milestone, Tish.

40
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,261
This very night, our 25th seance.

41
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:58,934
All those years gnawed by guilt...

42
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:01,353
undone by woe...

43
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:05,690
burning with uncertainty.

44
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:10,694
Don't torture yourself, Gomez.

45
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,196
That's my job.

46
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:15,950
Oh, Tish.

47
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:20,120
Imagine, darling,
if Fester did come back...

48
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:22,539
half alive... barely human,

49
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,124
a rotting shell.

50
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,918
Don't tease.

51
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:38,930
Ouch!

52
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:40,098
Stop it!

53
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,099
I'm warning you.

54
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:48,438
Look, darling. Tully is here.

55
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,190
Ah!

56
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:51,191
Tully!

57
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:53,235
Romping with Gate.

58
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:55,737
These are your
last paying clients,

59
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:57,322
may I remind you?

60
00:07:57,406 --> 00:07:59,408
If it gives you pleasure.

61
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,826
Something has to,

62
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:02,327
like a decent coat,

63
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:03,829
something dressy for evening.

64
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:05,831
Ask for a loan-- beg.

65
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:08,333
No loans. I am not a bum.

66
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,792
Don't say it.

67
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,420
I'll get the money.
I have a plan.

68
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:14,422
This is all so humiliating.

69
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:16,424
Why did I marry you?

70
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,217
Because I said yes.

71
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:20,219
I'm here to see Mrs. Addams

72
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:22,054
about the charity auction.

73
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,642
Stop it! Let go of me!

74
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:51,082
Ah, missed!

75
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,666
What's that?

76
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:01,342
Dirty pool, old man.

77
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:04,011
I like it.

78
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,022
Had enough?

79
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,190
Hah!

80
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,071
Where's my pen?

81
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:26,032
Never mind.

82
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:27,450
I'll take yours.

83
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:36,792
First, the old business.

84
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:41,171
Charity auction.
It's ridiculous.

85
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:44,341
Perhaps it's in here.

86
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:45,759
I don't think so.

87
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:55,226
"Uncle Niknak's winter wardrobe."

88
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,775
"Uncle Niknak's summer wardrobe."

89
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,697
"Uncle Niknak."

90
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:12,994
"The Fester Addams
offshore retirement fund"?

91
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,288
What would it do?

92
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:16,788
What wouldn't it do?

93
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:19,916
Fester, all tribute to thee.

94
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,085
Some called him inhumanly evil.

95
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:23,128
No.

96
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,629
Only our parents.

97
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,548
I called him brother.

98
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:29,426
His memory must live on
forever... through money.

99
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:33,388
I'm depositing the funds
under my name for tax purposes.

100
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:34,889
That's inspired.

101
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:37,391
He would've wanted it that way.

102
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:39,184
Beloved Fester.

103
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:42,396
Indeed!

104
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,440
For Fester!

105
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:45,941
For Fester, a brother.

106
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:46,942
My brother!

107
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:48,152
One of a kind!

108
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:49,445
- The doctors all said!
- Kind to animals.

109
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:50,779
So good with children.

110
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,281
They never proved anything.

111
00:10:52,323 --> 00:10:54,116
$1 million is the perfect amount.

112
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:55,117
It's brilliant.

113
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,952
It's untraceable.

114
00:10:58,494 --> 00:11:00,872
But, Tully,
it's not old business.

115
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:03,875
It's going to have to wait.
You know the rules better than that.

116
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,377
This is different.
This is in my name.

117
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,879
Make an exception.

118
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:10,131
Old business is old business.

119
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:12,300
This is new business,

120
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:15,345
and we do not discuss
new business until...

121
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:20,265
next quarter.

122
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:22,768
Next quarter?

123
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:24,102
Next quarter?

124
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,481
Fine lunge,

125
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:29,399
but your riposte--
tsk tsk tsk,

126
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:30,525
a tad rusty.

127
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:36,406
Make yourself comfortable, old man,

128
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,409
while I get the money
for the monthly expenses.

129
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,015
There it is.

130
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,394
Just what we've been searching for.

131
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,104
Thank you, Thing.

132
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,400
My God.

133
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,943
What is it?

134
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,237
A finger trap from
the court of Emperor Wu.

135
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,407
It must be worth a fortune.

136
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,908
Ooh, Morticia.

137
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,995
This is too extravagant...

138
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,247
even for the auction.

139
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,124
Let's keep it.

140
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,875
Hush, Mama.

141
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,377
It's for charity.

142
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,129
Widows and orphans.

143
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,381
We need more of them.

144
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,593
Margaret...

145
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,885
Hmm?

146
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,429
About the seance tonight.

147
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,930
I wish you'd come.

148
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:46,931
It's Gomez.

149
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:48,933
I'm terribly worried about him.

150
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,435
He won't eat.

151
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:52,437
He can't sleep.

152
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:54,689
He keeps coughing up blood.

153
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:57,692
He coughs up blood?

154
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:01,070
Well, not like he used to.

155
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:05,574
Down, kitty!

156
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:42,902
There.

157
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:44,946
The monthly expenses.

158
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:54,955
Miss Bradbury.

159
00:13:57,707 --> 00:13:59,417
Miss Bradbury!

160
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,336
She's gone home, Mr. Alford.

161
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:03,838
Oh, Mrs. Craven.

162
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:06,716
I wasjust about to call you.

163
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,217
I'm certain you were.

164
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,052
You haven't met my son Gordon,

165
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:12,346
have you, Mr. Alford?

166
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:13,847
Hello.

167
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,852
Is this the one, Mother?

168
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:21,855
That deadbeat you mentioned?

169
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,857
No, w-wait. Wait, wait, wait.

170
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:25,234
Hold on. Hold on.

171
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:27,236
Hold on. You have to listen to me.

172
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:30,238
Do we, Mr. Alford? And why?

173
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:31,531
Please...

174
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,324
Hear me out!

175
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,451
Hear me out!

176
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:36,494
Please...

177
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,288
Please! Ah!

178
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:40,373
Your call, Mother.

179
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:44,335
Gordon and I enjoy
a very special relationship.

180
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:45,837
She's a pip!

181
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:48,089
Refreshing, no? Down, Gordon.

182
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:49,674
- Mother.
- Gordon.

183
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:52,009
Gordon!

184
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,051
Yeow!

185
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:55,554
We've lent you
a considerable sum,

186
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:57,055
many thousands of dollars.

187
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:58,390
Payment due.

188
00:14:58,473 --> 00:15:00,350
I don't have the money.
I've tried everything.

189
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:03,103
Oh, Gordon, I want to believe him.

190
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:04,605
So do I.

191
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:05,814
Make me proud.

192
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:07,566
No, no, no, no, no.

193
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:17,116
He lied to us, Mother.

194
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,368
It's not what you think.

195
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,537
Those are doubloons
for the Addams account.

196
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,040
- Addams?
- There's a fortune.

197
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,125
But nobody can get to it.
I've tried.

198
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,126
Have you?

199
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,462
Have you tried hard enough?

200
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:30,796
Ask him, sweetheart.

201
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,173
No, no, no, sweetheart.
Don't ask.

202
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,098
Fester?

203
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:50,899
It's a miserable night.

204
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,400
I know, darling.

205
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:53,901
Seance weather.

206
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:57,863
Children, we're starting!

207
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,282
Put down that antenna.

208
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:07,665
It's unbelievable.

209
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:10,876
This hideous creature
and my little boy.

210
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,797
They could be twins.

211
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,093
But they're his family. What makes
you think they'll fall for it?

212
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:23,179
You shave your head.
We dress you up. No problem.

213
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:24,931
They'll think he's Fester,

214
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:26,182
their long-lost brother.

215
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,767
I hope so, for your sake.

216
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:29,811
I've been the Addams lawyer
foryears.

217
00:16:29,894 --> 00:16:30,812
They're morons.

218
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:31,938
Obviously.

219
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,398
What about the gold?

220
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:34,941
- They got this vault.
- Where?

221
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:36,316
I'm not sure.

222
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,818
That's a problem.

223
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:40,320
Fester's been missing for 25 years.

224
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:42,322
He and Gomez had a fight.

225
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:45,325
Gomez feels
incredibly guilty about it.

226
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,202
He'll tell you anything. Just ask.

227
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:48,203
It's foolproof.

228
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:51,540
It had better be. Now, get out.

229
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,083
It's going to be great.

230
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,044
You're gonna get back all
the money I owe you and--and more.

231
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:58,004
You'll see. Really.

232
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:02,258
This is it, Mother.

233
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:03,884
The one we've been waiting for.

234
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,386
No more loan sharking,

235
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:08,180
no more storefront scams.

236
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:11,183
I get the gold, and we're gone.

237
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,102
And Tully takes the rap.

238
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:14,228
Gordon, it's brilliant.

239
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:16,147
No, not Gordon.

240
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:17,689
Of course not.

241
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,190
Fester.

242
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:28,366
Big night for you guys,
eh, small fry?

243
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,537
Hello, sweetheart.

244
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:34,247
Could you?

245
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:40,252
Oh...

246
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:41,879
Thank God.

247
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:44,423
Welcome, honored guests.

248
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,177
Entrails?

249
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,484
Sing, O spirits.

250
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,986
Harken all souls.

251
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,988
Every year on this date,

252
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:11,824
we offer a clarion call
to Fester Addams.

253
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,660
Stop it.

254
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:14,661
Pugsley.

255
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:21,416
Kids.

256
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,254
From generation to generation,

257
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,047
our beacon to the beyond.

258
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:31,885
All close eyes and join hands.

259
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:40,644
Ow! What a grip! Ow!

260
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:42,520
Oh, my hand.

261
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:43,980
Ohh! My hand!

262
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:46,440
She's got my hand!

263
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:48,776
Aah!

264
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:50,570
Aah!

265
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:54,824
Aah!

266
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:55,866
Excuse me.

267
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,035
O.K., pumpkin, sit down.
Join the fun.

268
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,246
Mama, you should know better.

269
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:04,416
Thing, you're a handful.

270
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:05,417
Wednesday...

271
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,751
Let us ransom you

272
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:08,461
from the power of the grave.

273
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:11,965
Tonight, O Death,
let us be your plague.

274
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:13,049
Mama.

275
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,468
Fester Addams,

276
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:17,470
ceoli couris,

277
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:20,640
ferimani bo--

278
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,643
I feel that he's near.

279
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,689
Fester Addams...

280
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:30,524
gather your strength...

281
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:34,528
and knock three times.

282
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:40,034
Did you hear that?

283
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,827
Ask again, Mama, quickly.

284
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:43,662
- By all means.
- Ask, ask.

285
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:49,626
Fester Addams,
I demand that you knock again.

286
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:02,931
He's at the door!

287
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:21,240
- Could it be?
- Is it him?

288
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:24,159
- Is it possible?
- Oh, my God.

289
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:27,870
Fester.

290
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:30,039
Gomez.

291
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:48,556
Good evening.

292
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,850
I am Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

293
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,898
He was found in Miami,

294
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:58,900
tangled in a tuna net.

295
00:20:58,984 --> 00:21:00,694
It was just last month

296
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:03,530
during the Hurricane Helga.

297
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:07,033
The sky,
it was black like pitch.

298
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:09,535
The waves, they were walls of doom.

299
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,078
Can you imagine?

300
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:13,038
They drag him from the ocean,

301
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,040
from the very jaws ofoblivion.

302
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:16,542
I'm telling you.

303
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:19,545
There were tests,
so many tests.

304
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:24,008
A complete psychological profile.

305
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:25,217
At long last,

306
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:28,053
the Florida Department
of the Fish and the Game,

307
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:30,097
they say, lo and behold,

308
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,056
oh, my, oh, my, oh, my...

309
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:34,767
go tell it on the mountains,

310
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:37,562
he is your brother.

311
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:42,567
Boom! They give him to me
at Human Services,

312
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:47,071
and I am bringing him,
after all these years,

313
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:49,532
after who knows
what heartache,

314
00:21:49,616 --> 00:21:52,326
after the naked and the dead,

315
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:55,996
I am bringing him home to you.

316
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,706
That's preposterous.

317
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:00,292
Isn't that the most ridiculous thing
you've ever heard?

318
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,668
It certainly is.

319
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:03,045
Ahh.

320
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,048
Now you're back.

321
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,090
Yes, back.

322
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:09,927
Back to share your joys,
your sorrows--

323
00:22:09,968 --> 00:22:12,721
Hey, everything.

324
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:14,305
I just don't know.

325
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:16,307
How does this work, again?

326
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,226
An infant would understand.

327
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:20,978
Ha ha!

328
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:23,022
Fester Addams...

329
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:24,607
home at long last.

330
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:28,736
Well, at least for a week.

331
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,238
A week?

332
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:32,240
Don't be ridiculous.
You're home.

333
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:34,532
Sorry, but I have to get back.

334
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:38,328
Got a lot of things cooking
in the Bermuda Triangle.

335
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:39,329
Oh, Gomez.

336
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:40,830
The Bermuda Triangle.

337
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:43,333
Devil's Island.

338
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,043
The black hole of Calcutta.

339
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:46,044
Excuse us.

340
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:48,088
Second honeymoon.

341
00:22:49,422 --> 00:22:51,258
Dr. Pinder-Schloss,

342
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:53,635
will you be staying with us, too?

343
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:55,886
No, no. I must be going.

344
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,222
But I will be back, you can bet,

345
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:01,392
to be checking
on Fester's adjustment.

346
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:03,060
Cool.

347
00:23:03,143 --> 00:23:05,396
Nobody gets out
of the Bermuda Triangle,

348
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,981
not even for a vacation.

349
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:09,066
Everyone knows that.

350
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:10,568
Oh, my little bundle.

351
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:12,570
So much you don't understand.

352
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:17,407
The human spirit,
it is a hard thing to kill.

353
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,201
Even with a chain saw.

354
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:30,003
Unpacking?

355
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:32,130
Let me.

356
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:35,133
It's all right. I can do it.

357
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:36,884
Crowbar.

358
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:42,931
Dynamite.

359
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,231
"Cyanide."

360
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,068
Fester...

361
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,404
as if we'd run out.

362
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,909
Good night.

363
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,524
Nosy little brat.

364
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,751
Who's there?

365
00:26:10,196 --> 00:26:11,364
Aah!

366
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:13,116
Aah!

367
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:15,493
Aah! Aah! Aah!

368
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:18,413
My own dear brother.

369
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,251
I've got goose bumps.

370
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:25,212
I know.

371
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:27,963
Screams in the night...

372
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:30,007
It can only mean one thing.

373
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,385
He's home.

374
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,724
Please! Please!

375
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:41,727
Leave me alone!

376
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,585
Breakfast?

377
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:13,131
Damn, it's good to have you back.

378
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,216
Let's go.

379
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,053
Two out of three?

380
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,641
Ha ha ha ha ha!

381
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,977
Home cooking!

382
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,772
There's nothing like it
in the world.

383
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,523
May I have the salt?

384
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:35,570
What do we say?

385
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:36,821
Now.

386
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,082
What is this?

387
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:50,750
Mama's specialite de la maison.

388
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:53,420
Oh, Tish.

389
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:57,424
Start with the eyes.

390
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:01,219
Did you sleep well?

391
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:04,472
Like the dead.

392
00:28:04,556 --> 00:28:06,975
Really? Who would have
thought the Bermuda Triangle

393
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:08,602
could change a man so much?

394
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,854
You used to toss and turn all night.

395
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:13,439
We had to chain you to the bedpost.

396
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:14,940
Doesn't make sense.

397
00:28:16,483 --> 00:28:20,446
The Bermuda Triangle is a very
strange and mysterious place.

398
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:24,491
You'd be surprised at all
the things you don't know.

399
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:27,244
She certainly would.

400
00:28:27,328 --> 00:28:30,581
Wednesday adores
the Bermuda Triangle.

401
00:28:30,664 --> 00:28:32,082
She studies it.

402
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,083
Death at sea--
She's hooked.

403
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,752
Ask me anything.

404
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:42,592
Being in my old room
sure brings back memories.

405
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:44,510
Remember Camp Custer?

406
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:47,055
For preteen offenders.

407
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:58,523
Aren't memories precious?

408
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:02,945
Today I'd like to wander
through the house... remembering.

409
00:29:03,028 --> 00:29:05,364
No, no. Sorry, old man,
no wandering today.

410
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:08,242
Today we're going
straight to the vault.

411
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:20,753
Bravo, Pugsley!

412
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:28,886
Greed!

413
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,478
I feel like we're children again.

414
00:29:38,562 --> 00:29:39,980
Tag. You're it!

415
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:42,148
Whee!

416
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:53,910
Aah!

417
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,248
Oh!

418
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:01,876
Aah!

419
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:06,005
Smell that air, Fester.

420
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:10,593
Like a tomb.

421
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:17,974
Tutti a bordo, fratello mio.

422
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:21,144
The sea-- your second home.

423
00:30:21,227 --> 00:30:23,605
Ship ahoy.

424
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,955
Do you think that's
really Uncle Fester?

425
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,750
Father says so,
but I think Mother isn't sure.

426
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,713
Pugsley, sit in the chair.

427
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:51,965
- Why?
- So we can play a game.

428
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:58,889
What game?

429
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:02,141
It's called...

430
00:31:02,225 --> 00:31:04,060
Is There A God?

431
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,501
The vault!

432
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,002
Ha ha!

433
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:32,504
2 to the right.

434
00:31:32,587 --> 00:31:34,506
10 to the left.

435
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:36,508
And then around to...

436
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:39,511
Uh... 5.

437
00:31:39,594 --> 00:31:40,512
11.

438
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:43,013
2, 10, 11.

439
00:31:43,097 --> 00:31:45,015
Eyes, fingers, toes.

440
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:47,601
So many years.

441
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,195
Welcome back.

442
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,405
Thanks.

443
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:03,908
Our secret place.

444
00:32:03,992 --> 00:32:05,702
Sanctus sanctorum.

445
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:08,997
If these walls
could speak, eh, old man?

446
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:11,499
What, uh,
what would they say?

447
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,501
You tell me.

448
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:14,502
You first.

449
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:16,004
Uh-uh.

450
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:17,797
Senior partner.

451
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:20,675
Junior spaceman.

452
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:24,012
First a brandy. Do the honors.

453
00:32:24,053 --> 00:32:26,513
I've got a real treat in store.

454
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:29,182
Where is it,
you ridiculous imbecile?

455
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,558
Aha!

456
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,019
Show time!

457
00:33:44,964 --> 00:33:46,298
There.

458
00:33:46,382 --> 00:33:48,800
The debutante ball.

459
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:51,344
Remember that fateful night?

460
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:54,138
Of course.

461
00:33:58,726 --> 00:34:01,312
Your first cigar.

462
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:04,649
What? Come on.
I've smoked since I was 5.

463
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:06,234
Mother insisted.

464
00:34:08,528 --> 00:34:11,488
Flora and Fauna.

465
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,032
Quite the pair, eh, Gomez?

466
00:34:14,116 --> 00:34:16,118
Can you ever forgive me?

467
00:34:17,536 --> 00:34:19,037
What?

468
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:23,000
I didn't love them,
yet I wooed them both

469
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,501
out of foolish pride.

470
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:29,006
You were so dashing, you could
have any woman you wanted,

471
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,507
dead or alive.

472
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,592
I was jealous.

473
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:34,760
Insanely jealous.

474
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:36,470
I admit that now.

475
00:34:40,057 --> 00:34:42,518
But I did not mean to drive you off.

476
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,729
Not to the Bermuda Triangle.

477
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:47,481
Water under the bridge.

478
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,609
Forgiven. Forgotten.

479
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:59,451
Come on. Say it.

480
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:01,661
Say the secret password.

481
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:03,455
The password? I...

482
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:05,957
Come on. Stop fooling.
You remember.

483
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,459
Please.

484
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:09,211
I'm choking. Please.

485
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:11,129
You forgot our secret password,

486
00:35:11,213 --> 00:35:13,964
the word we used
a hundred times a day,

487
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,508
our special private name
for each other?

488
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:20,221
That was a long time ago
when we were children.

489
00:35:20,304 --> 00:35:24,725
You almost killed me,
you demented freak.

490
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:27,686
Poor devil, what did they do
to you in that Bermuda Triangle?

491
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:30,731
But if he's not Uncle Fester,
then who is he?

492
00:35:30,814 --> 00:35:31,899
Somebody else.

493
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,902
It has to warm up.

494
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:36,903
Why?

495
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:39,197
So it can kill you.

496
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,990
I knew that.

497
00:35:42,158 --> 00:35:44,244
Children, what are you doing?

498
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:46,037
I'm going to electrocute him.

499
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,915
But we're late
for the charity auction.

500
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:49,916
But, Mother...

501
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:50,917
I said no.

502
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,085
Please?

503
00:35:52,168 --> 00:35:54,879
Oh, all right.

504
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:08,475
This magnificent piece
is encrusted with rubies

505
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,394
and 15 emerald chips.

506
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:15,440
Uh, it was donated by
Morticia and Gomez Addams.

507
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:18,442
Remember, this year,
over half our proceeds

508
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:20,903
will benefit the elderly

509
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,363
and the mentally disabled.

510
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,408
I'll open the bidding at $5,000.

511
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,953
5? Hah! Not good enough.

512
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:30,037
$20,000.

513
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,539
What are they doing?

514
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,707
I have 20.

515
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,709
- 25.
- 25.

516
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:35,710
Cara mia?

517
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:36,711
30.

518
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,753
Mon sauvage.

519
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:39,796
35.

520
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:41,965
Eres divina.

521
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:42,966
50.

522
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:46,136
I have $50,000.

523
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:47,929
Your turn, my ecstasy.

524
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:52,434
50,000 going once.
50,000 going twice.

525
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:56,938
Sold to Morticia Addams for $50,000.

526
00:37:07,448 --> 00:37:10,868
Isn't it too enchanting?

527
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:13,078
How do you take it off?

528
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:17,625
There's a trick to it...

529
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:21,836
of course.

530
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:35,350
"How do you take it off?"
That's absurd.

531
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:37,852
That finger trap
was a party favor

532
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:39,354
at his 10th birthday.

533
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:44,483
Oh, no.

534
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:47,152
Father's playing with his trains.

535
00:37:47,236 --> 00:37:50,364
He wore that finger trap
for two years.

536
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:53,367
Mother had to teach him
to eat with his feet.

537
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,869
And the combination
and the password

538
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:58,997
and my cigar,
and he slept so well.

539
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,709
He's using the diesel.

540
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:16,472
The covered bridge.

541
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:21,143
Dead man's curve.

542
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,263
Aah!

543
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:05,101
Aah!

544
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:14,777
Aah!

545
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:17,405
It's all about
Uncle Fester, isn't it?

546
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:30,250
Spirits above me,
give me a sign.

547
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:34,922
Shall I be joyous,
or shall I be damned?

548
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:50,811
Sleepless night?

549
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:56,317
Walk with me, Fester.

550
00:40:00,696 --> 00:40:03,783
Aunt LaBorgia.

551
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:06,953
Executed by a firing squad.

552
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:08,912
Cousin Fledge.

553
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:13,458
Torn limb from limb
by four wild horses.

554
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,836
And darling Uncle Eimar.

555
00:40:18,213 --> 00:40:21,508
Buried alive.

556
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,426
Psychopaths...

557
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,804
fiends...

558
00:40:25,846 --> 00:40:27,347
mad-dog killers.

559
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:28,348
Brutes, Fester.

560
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,683
Pioneers.

561
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:33,602
Lest we forget.

562
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:35,938
Your beloved Muerto.

563
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:41,360
After you left,
he was simply a different vulture.

564
00:40:41,402 --> 00:40:44,238
He wouldn't circle.

565
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:46,949
He wouldn't peck.

566
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,452
That's how much
you mean to this family.

567
00:40:57,542 --> 00:41:00,879
Mother and Father Addams.

568
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:02,672
How I wish the children

569
00:41:02,714 --> 00:41:05,049
could have known them better,

570
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:08,636
but tell that to an angry mob.

571
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,056
And our credo,

572
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,060
"Sic gorgiamus allos
subjectatos nunc."

573
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:20,898
We gladly feast on those
who would subdue us.

574
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,775
Not just pretty words.

575
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:28,614
As an Addams,

576
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:31,366
you understand completely,
don't you?

577
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,911
As an Addams...

578
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:37,205
yes, I do.

579
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,918
Good night, Fester.

580
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:46,380
Rest in peace.

581
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,933
They're on to me, Mother.
I'm almost sure.

582
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,394
Of course I tried. I still can't
find it. You gotta get over here.

583
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,397
"Arsenic, cyanide"--
cyan--arsenic.

584
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,399
Don't say that.

585
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,444
You know I do.

586
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,405
His trains are everywhere.

587
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,907
The children are beside themselves.

588
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,409
Is that for your brother?

589
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,161
I don't think so.

590
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,920
This can't go on.

591
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,423
How can I help him?
Tell me, Mama.

592
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,427
Troubled husbands.

593
00:42:35,468 --> 00:42:36,427
Adultery?

594
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:37,428
Oh, no.

595
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,348
Uh, financial, money troubles?

596
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:42,433
No.

597
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:44,435
"Turned into toad or reptile."

598
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:45,728
Is there an index?

599
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:49,315
They know I'm a fraud.

600
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:50,817
The whole bunch.

601
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,819
It's not going to work.

602
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,489
Who knows? Gomez,
that overheated moron?

603
00:42:56,572 --> 00:42:58,866
He's no moron.
He's Fester's brother.

604
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:01,368
They had some
awful fight years ago.

605
00:43:01,451 --> 00:43:03,662
He's suspicious.
They all are. I can tell.

606
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:06,874
Really? Well,
thank God I came over here.

607
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,876
I will counsel
the troubled family,

608
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:10,377
ease their distress.

609
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,629
It's my calling,
remember, Gordon?

610
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:14,131
What?

611
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:17,509
I'm a doctor.

612
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,679
Why don't you speak
to Fester, darling?

613
00:43:21,762 --> 00:43:23,681
He's right outside the door.

614
00:43:23,764 --> 00:43:26,893
I would speak with Fester
if that were Fester,

615
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:29,896
but that is not.
That's an impostor.

616
00:43:29,979 --> 00:43:31,898
An impostore!

617
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:35,318
A charlatan! A sham!

618
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,611
A counterfeit.

619
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:43,617
Hmm...

620
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,704
O villain, villain,
smiling, damned villain.

621
00:43:47,787 --> 00:43:50,415
Who calls me a villain,
breaks my pate across,

622
00:43:50,499 --> 00:43:52,125
cuts off my beard,
and blows it in my face?

623
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:55,128
If I must strike you dead,
I will.

624
00:43:55,212 --> 00:43:57,255
Ohh...

625
00:44:01,425 --> 00:44:02,885
Ohh...

626
00:44:02,927 --> 00:44:05,179
Ahh...

627
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:08,180
No.

628
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:12,643
No, no, no, no, no, no.

629
00:44:12,726 --> 00:44:16,063
Give me that sword.

630
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:18,065
Haven't you ever
slaughtered anyone?

631
00:44:18,106 --> 00:44:20,192
He's only a child.

632
00:44:20,275 --> 00:44:21,359
No excuse.

633
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:23,402
Aim for a major artery.

634
00:44:23,444 --> 00:44:25,404
The jugular.

635
00:44:25,446 --> 00:44:26,948
A faker!

636
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,908
A phony!

637
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:30,701
An utter fraud!

638
00:44:30,785 --> 00:44:33,329
A base, deceitful--

639
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:35,665
Mr. Addams!

640
00:44:35,748 --> 00:44:37,667
I believe I am understanding.

641
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,168
I can help, yes?

642
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:43,713
The theory of displacement--

643
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:45,048
Is this familiar?

644
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:47,425
No. Tish?

645
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:50,053
Oh, it is too exciting.

646
00:44:50,136 --> 00:44:52,389
I will explain.

647
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,932
Is it unpleasant?

648
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,268
Deeply.

649
00:44:57,978 --> 00:45:02,858
Your very own brother,
you drive him away.

650
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:04,608
"Go! Off with you!"

651
00:45:04,692 --> 00:45:06,360
But then you are feeling

652
00:45:06,443 --> 00:45:08,821
the little black monster.

653
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:09,822
Pugsley.

654
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:11,365
Guilt. Yes?

655
00:45:11,448 --> 00:45:15,369
Your brother returns.
You feel guilty.

656
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:16,745
You displace.

657
00:45:16,787 --> 00:45:18,038
I do?

658
00:45:18,122 --> 00:45:20,374
The feelings
in your brain cells,

659
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:22,376
they bubble and collide.

660
00:45:22,459 --> 00:45:24,878
You suspect things.

661
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:28,590
You love him,
but you resent him.

662
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:29,591
Love. Hate.

663
00:45:29,632 --> 00:45:30,884
Hate. Love.

664
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:33,303
Like for Mama. No?

665
00:45:33,386 --> 00:45:36,639
I didn't hate my mother.
It was an accident.

666
00:45:36,723 --> 00:45:41,311
It's a very common psychosis.
I'm seeing it every day.

667
00:45:41,394 --> 00:45:42,896
Lucky doctor.

668
00:45:42,979 --> 00:45:46,398
Displacement. How bizarre.

669
00:45:46,481 --> 00:45:50,402
And here I thought
Fester was the problem.

670
00:45:50,485 --> 00:45:51,403
He's sullen.

671
00:45:51,486 --> 00:45:52,905
- He's furtive.
- Backstabbing.

672
00:45:52,988 --> 00:45:55,073
- He sulks.
- I suspect him.

673
00:45:55,157 --> 00:45:56,575
- You're unbalanced.
- And I hate him.

674
00:45:56,658 --> 00:46:00,829
By God, you're right!
He is Fester!

675
00:46:00,913 --> 00:46:02,998
Thankyou, Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

676
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:05,626
I do what I can.

677
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:08,836
You see, children,
there's lots to learn.

678
00:46:12,423 --> 00:46:13,841
"Gangrene."

679
00:46:13,925 --> 00:46:15,843
Ooh...

680
00:46:15,927 --> 00:46:18,846
Uncle Fester,
how do you know so much?

681
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,349
I've been around.
I pick things up.

682
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:22,850
In the Bermuda Triangle?

683
00:46:24,435 --> 00:46:27,188
Look, children,
a new chapter.

684
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:30,106
- "Scabs."
- "Scabs."

685
00:46:36,446 --> 00:46:39,866
Three parts dynamite
with a nitroglycerin cap.

686
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,869
It's perfect for
small holes, carports,

687
00:46:42,953 --> 00:46:44,704
and toolsheds.

688
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:52,002
Mother.

689
00:46:52,044 --> 00:46:55,548
Everyone will be at the
children's play tonight, correct?

690
00:46:55,631 --> 00:46:58,551
Oh, yes,
I've been working with them.

691
00:46:58,634 --> 00:47:00,177
It's going to be fun.

692
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:01,136
Fun?

693
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,974
Is that what
we're here for, fun?

694
00:47:05,057 --> 00:47:06,600
Oh, darling, forgive me.

695
00:47:06,684 --> 00:47:08,352
See what they've driven me to?

696
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:10,395
I've raised a hand to my child,

697
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:11,980
my reason for living.

698
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:16,150
You can't go to the play.

699
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,652
But the kids...

700
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:21,072
The house will be deserted.
The vault will be ours.

701
00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:22,073
But, Mother...

702
00:47:22,157 --> 00:47:24,576
Can you hear it, my treasure?

703
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:27,579
My heartbeat.
It beats only for you.

704
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:30,831
Listen closely. It says,
"Gordon, I love you.

705
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,167
Gordon, the vault."

706
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,086
I do hear it.

707
00:47:36,128 --> 00:47:38,088
Soon we'll have the money,

708
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,591
and we'll be far from here.

709
00:47:40,632 --> 00:47:42,217
Loving mother...

710
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:44,386
grateful son.

711
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,762
Understood?

712
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:53,895
Ah, there you are, at last.

713
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,898
What a fool I was to doubt you.

714
00:47:56,939 --> 00:47:59,901
Dr. Pinder-Schloss
explained everything.

715
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:02,987
What a lovely woman. So chilly.

716
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:06,324
Displacement.
It's a common psychosis.

717
00:48:06,407 --> 00:48:08,326
Isn't that grand?

718
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:09,327
Is it?

719
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,412
Look at it, Fester.

720
00:48:11,496 --> 00:48:13,330
The primeval ooze--

721
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:16,208
quicksand, fumes, toxic waste.

722
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:17,709
It's all ours, Fester.

723
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:19,711
You belong here, old man.

724
00:48:19,794 --> 00:48:21,338
Stay.

725
00:48:21,421 --> 00:48:23,840
You don't know what you're asking.

726
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:25,842
You have a beautiful wife,

727
00:48:25,926 --> 00:48:27,344
wonderful children,

728
00:48:27,427 --> 00:48:29,846
a wasteland.

729
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,806
I'm in the way.

730
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:36,310
In the way? My brother?

731
00:48:36,352 --> 00:48:38,854
Gomez, take care.

732
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:42,483
For you,
life is all fun and games.

733
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:44,860
You dance in a graveyard.

734
00:48:44,944 --> 00:48:46,362
Stench. Decay.

735
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:47,863
But things change.

736
00:48:47,947 --> 00:48:50,825
Precisely. You're back.

737
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:54,370
All those years apart, Fester.

738
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:57,205
We can't do that again.

739
00:48:59,457 --> 00:49:01,876
You're home.

740
00:49:24,857 --> 00:49:26,859
Fore!

741
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:32,865
Damn you, Addams!

742
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:39,996
Uncle Fester?

743
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:42,331
Come on, Uncle Fester.

744
00:49:42,415 --> 00:49:43,875
Come to the play.

745
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,751
I said I was busy.

746
00:49:45,835 --> 00:49:48,254
But you said you'd help us

747
00:49:48,337 --> 00:49:50,756
with the Shakespeare and the pus.

748
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,426
I changed my mind.

749
00:50:07,147 --> 00:50:10,609
Mrs. Addams,
can I see you for a moment?

750
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,110
I'm Susan Firkins.

751
00:50:12,152 --> 00:50:13,612
I'm Wednesday's teacher.

752
00:50:13,653 --> 00:50:14,988
Oh, of course.

753
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:17,908
Wednesday's told us
so much about you.

754
00:50:26,248 --> 00:50:28,167
Wednesday is
an excellent student,

755
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,669
but, frankly, I'm concerned.

756
00:50:30,753 --> 00:50:33,631
You see, this is
our class bulletin board.

757
00:50:33,672 --> 00:50:35,591
This month our theme
is our heroes--

758
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:38,135
people we love and admire.

759
00:50:38,177 --> 00:50:41,137
You see, Susan Ringo
has chosen the president.

760
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:42,764
Isn't that sweet?

761
00:50:44,015 --> 00:50:48,186
And Harmony Feld
has picked Jane Pauley.

762
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:51,147
Have you spoken to her parents?

763
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,235
But Wednesday
brought in this picture--

764
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:58,238
Calpurnia Addams.

765
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,949
Wednesday's
Great-aunt Calpurnia.

766
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,909
She was burned
as a witch in 1706.

767
00:51:03,992 --> 00:51:07,412
They say she danced naked
in the town square

768
00:51:07,496 --> 00:51:10,040
and enslaved a minister.

769
00:51:10,123 --> 00:51:11,250
Really?

770
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:12,584
Oh, yes.

771
00:51:12,668 --> 00:51:14,086
But don't worry.

772
00:51:14,169 --> 00:51:15,921
We've told Wednesday

773
00:51:16,004 --> 00:51:17,589
college first.

774
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:22,052
Isn't he adorable?

775
00:51:22,135 --> 00:51:23,928
I made this myself.

776
00:51:24,011 --> 00:51:25,054
It's charming.

777
00:51:25,137 --> 00:51:27,598
What is he, a lizard?

778
00:51:27,682 --> 00:51:28,683
An elf.

779
00:51:30,184 --> 00:51:31,853
Look at you.

780
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:40,069
That's better.

781
00:51:40,153 --> 00:51:42,613
You are too precious for words.

782
00:51:42,697 --> 00:51:46,241
Why, I could just eat you alive.

783
00:51:46,324 --> 00:51:48,201
Oh, no, Margaret. Too young.

784
00:52:20,149 --> 00:52:22,026
Wednesday, Pugsley.

785
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:23,986
I changed my mind.

786
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:25,404
Uncle Fester.

787
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:35,079
Gordon? Gordon?

788
00:52:35,163 --> 00:52:36,581
It's Mother.

789
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,586
Damn it, where is he?

790
00:52:42,754 --> 00:52:45,215
I never should have used him.

791
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:58,602
I knew you couldn't
stay away, old man.

792
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,621
Damn it.

793
00:53:20,122 --> 00:53:23,084
Gordon. Gordon!

794
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,585
Are you there?

795
00:53:26,128 --> 00:53:27,088
Gordon.

796
00:53:30,465 --> 00:53:32,467
Ooh! Ooh! My goodness!

797
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:34,511
Say! Look! Ooh!
Will somebody come here--

798
00:53:34,594 --> 00:53:36,138
Oh, good--Oh! Aah!

799
00:53:36,221 --> 00:53:38,098
Oh, my!

800
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,724
Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Ah-ha ha!

801
00:53:39,808 --> 00:53:41,726
How all occasions
do inform against me

802
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,603
and spur my dull revenge.

803
00:53:43,645 --> 00:53:45,647
Oh, from this time forth,

804
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,233
my thoughts be bloody
or nothing worth.

805
00:53:48,316 --> 00:53:51,110
If I must strike you dead, I will.

806
00:53:52,278 --> 00:53:53,445
A hit!

807
00:53:54,572 --> 00:53:56,824
A very palpable hit.

808
00:54:07,626 --> 00:54:09,962
O proud Death...

809
00:54:10,004 --> 00:54:13,465
what feast is toward
in thine eternal cell?

810
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:17,802
Sweet Oblivion, open your arms.

811
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:36,945
Bravo!

812
00:54:38,864 --> 00:54:39,865
Bravo!

813
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:41,867
Bravo!

814
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,494
Bravo!

815
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:47,539
Bravo!

816
00:54:47,623 --> 00:54:49,333
Bravo!

817
00:54:49,374 --> 00:54:53,336
There were sailors, pirates,

818
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:57,340
and a plane full of tourists
from Miami Beach,

819
00:54:57,381 --> 00:55:00,092
all lost in the Triangle.

820
00:55:00,176 --> 00:55:03,054
Uncle Fester,
will you take me there someday?

821
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:05,056
It's a promise.

822
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:06,849
Good night, Wednesday.

823
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:07,892
Good night.

824
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:09,393
You were terrific.

825
00:55:11,604 --> 00:55:12,563
Uncle Fester?

826
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:37,086
A theatrical triumph.

827
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:39,213
It's like a dream.

828
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:40,756
When we first met,

829
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:43,551
it was an evening much like this.

830
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:46,095
Magic in the air.

831
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:48,097
A boy.

832
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:49,890
A girl.

833
00:55:49,932 --> 00:55:51,892
An open grave.

834
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:54,061
It was my first funeral.

835
00:55:54,103 --> 00:55:57,564
You were so beautiful.

836
00:55:57,647 --> 00:55:59,774
Pale and mysterious.

837
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:02,777
No one even looked at the corpse.

838
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:05,780
Your cousin Balthazar.

839
00:56:05,822 --> 00:56:08,158
You were still a suspect.

840
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:11,661
I couldn't stop staring at you

841
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,663
all through the eulogy.

842
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:19,001
Your eyes, your mustache,

843
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,961
your laugh.

844
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,506
You bewitched me.

845
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,594
I proposed that very night.

846
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,095
Just think--

847
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,598
Someday we'll be buried here,

848
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,602
side by side, 6 feet under,

849
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,103
in matching coffins,

850
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,439
our lifeless bodies

851
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:45,818
rotting together for all eternity.

852
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,614
Cara mia.

853
00:56:50,948 --> 00:56:53,493
Mon sauvage.

854
00:57:23,646 --> 00:57:25,272
Hey, bigfoot.

855
00:57:29,401 --> 00:57:30,486
Don't stare.

856
00:57:30,528 --> 00:57:31,987
Just get me out.

857
00:57:38,828 --> 00:57:40,246
Did you like the blood?

858
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:43,164
I was so proud.

859
00:57:43,248 --> 00:57:44,207
Weren't we all?

860
00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:46,876
Wednesday, play with your food.

861
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:51,923
Aah!

862
00:57:52,006 --> 00:57:54,592
Aah!

863
00:57:54,676 --> 00:57:56,845
Mama?

864
00:57:56,886 --> 00:57:58,847
Who put this in here?

865
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:02,100
That's for company.

866
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:03,809
Rascals.

867
00:58:03,892 --> 00:58:06,770
Doctor, you were so right.

868
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:08,522
What an evening.

869
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,440
Fester fit right in.

870
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:11,733
The displacement is over.

871
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:13,986
Isn't that nice?

872
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:15,529
Does he really have to go?

873
00:58:15,571 --> 00:58:17,573
Yes, he does.

874
00:58:17,614 --> 00:58:20,909
Well, if he insists upon leaving,

875
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:23,328
we shall mark the occasion.

876
00:58:24,537 --> 00:58:25,830
Tish?

877
00:58:25,913 --> 00:58:27,832
We've planned a farewell party.

878
00:58:27,915 --> 00:58:31,252
We've invited the entire clan.

879
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:32,795
What a lovely gesture.

880
00:58:32,879 --> 00:58:34,755
We're a family again,

881
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,800
and we owe it all to you,
Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

882
00:58:37,884 --> 00:58:40,052
Please--Greta.

883
00:58:40,136 --> 00:58:41,429
Greta.

884
00:58:42,513 --> 00:58:44,932
Fester, walk me out.

885
00:58:49,394 --> 00:58:51,313
I'm fine, Mother.

886
00:58:51,396 --> 00:58:52,814
I'm completely in control.

887
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:54,816
They're not your family, Gordon.

888
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,817
I am.

889
00:58:55,901 --> 00:58:57,277
They don't love you.

890
00:58:57,319 --> 00:58:58,320
I do.

891
00:58:58,403 --> 00:59:00,822
They're evil
and corrupt and degraded.

892
00:59:00,906 --> 00:59:03,283
I can give you that.

893
00:59:03,366 --> 00:59:04,785
I'm fine. Really.

894
00:59:04,868 --> 00:59:05,786
We'll see.

895
00:59:05,869 --> 00:59:06,786
Open up.

896
00:59:35,897 --> 00:59:37,774
A party?

897
00:59:37,816 --> 00:59:40,276
For me?

898
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:41,778
Here?

899
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:49,827
Tish,

900
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:53,831
how long has it been
since we've waltzed?

901
00:59:53,872 --> 00:59:55,791
Oh, Gomez.

902
00:59:59,837 --> 01:00:01,296
Hours.

903
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:11,530
It, old man!

904
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:13,740
You're right.

905
01:01:13,782 --> 01:01:14,908
Far too long.

906
01:01:21,331 --> 01:01:23,082
Don't let me out of your sight.

907
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:24,584
Don't threaten me, Margaret.

908
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:26,085
These people are abnormal.

909
01:01:26,169 --> 01:01:27,086
Don't exaggerate.

910
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,302
Oh, by all means.

911
01:01:35,385 --> 01:01:36,929
They're clients, Margaret.

912
01:01:37,012 --> 01:01:38,806
Wheeee!

913
01:01:44,436 --> 01:01:45,896
Wednesday?

914
01:01:45,938 --> 01:01:47,439
Yes, Mother?

915
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:49,358
Would you run upstairs

916
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:51,276
and check on your uncle, please?

917
01:01:51,318 --> 01:01:52,903
Why, Lumpy Addams.

918
01:01:52,945 --> 01:01:55,279
Look at you.

919
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:57,281
All grown up.

920
01:02:09,335 --> 01:02:10,795
Uncle Fester?

921
01:02:13,923 --> 01:02:14,841
I understand.

922
01:02:14,924 --> 01:02:16,299
I hope so.

923
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:17,801
I'm counting on you.

924
01:02:17,843 --> 01:02:20,804
Don't let me down.
Don't buckle.

925
01:02:20,846 --> 01:02:22,305
It's not gonna be easy.

926
01:02:22,347 --> 01:02:23,640
There are people everywhere.

927
01:02:23,723 --> 01:02:26,643
You can do it
if you stop whining.

928
01:02:26,726 --> 01:02:28,145
Nobody likes that.

929
01:02:28,228 --> 01:02:29,771
It's unattractive.

930
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,273
All right. Fine.

931
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:34,109
I will try and reach
the vault tonight.

932
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:36,361
But if I can't,

933
01:02:36,445 --> 01:02:38,362
well, then that's it.

934
01:02:38,446 --> 01:02:40,239
O.K., Mother?

935
01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:42,158
I knew it.

936
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:43,534
You are a fake.

937
01:02:43,617 --> 01:02:45,995
Come here, my little one.

938
01:02:46,078 --> 01:02:46,996
Wednesday!

939
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:48,998
Get her!

940
01:03:33,624 --> 01:03:36,835
Flora and Fauna Amor.

941
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:38,837
I cannot see.

942
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:42,715
I am blinded by such beauty.

943
01:03:42,757 --> 01:03:43,716
Gomez Addams.

944
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:45,218
You terrible flirt.

945
01:03:45,301 --> 01:03:46,219
Always was.

946
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:47,220
At least with me.

947
01:03:47,303 --> 01:03:48,221
Copycat!

948
01:03:48,304 --> 01:03:49,847
Tag-along!

949
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:51,224
Why, Gomez, the Amor twins.

950
01:03:51,307 --> 01:03:53,226
I've heard so much about you.

951
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:54,727
Morticia, you nabbed him.

952
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:55,728
This darling man.

953
01:03:55,812 --> 01:03:56,938
He was mine!

954
01:03:57,021 --> 01:03:58,523
He was mine!

955
01:03:58,564 --> 01:04:00,066
How can I compete?

956
01:04:00,108 --> 01:04:02,067
You're twice the woman I am.

957
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:04,736
Tully, the Amor twins.

958
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,114
They're waiting for Fester.

959
01:04:07,197 --> 01:04:08,240
Amuse them.

960
01:04:10,075 --> 01:04:11,701
Hello, Tully.

961
01:04:11,743 --> 01:04:14,079
Oh, my God.

962
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:21,253
You mean you don't know?

963
01:04:21,336 --> 01:04:22,920
It's too intriguing.

964
01:04:23,003 --> 01:04:25,923
Fester's king of the castle again,
isn't he?

965
01:04:26,006 --> 01:04:28,926
Fester's the older brother,
so he gets it all--

966
01:04:29,009 --> 01:04:30,928
The house, the money,
you name it.

967
01:04:31,011 --> 01:04:32,555
Fester's single, isn't he?

968
01:04:32,596 --> 01:04:34,431
Are you, Mr. Alford?

969
01:04:34,515 --> 01:04:36,267
Why, Fauna--

970
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,726
I'm Fauna.

971
01:04:37,768 --> 01:04:39,728
I'm Flora.

972
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,230
I'm flattered.

973
01:04:41,272 --> 01:04:43,190
Excuse me, ladies.

974
01:04:47,777 --> 01:04:49,737
I can't find her anywhere.

975
01:04:49,779 --> 01:04:51,239
Let's just leave.

976
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:52,740
Out the back.

977
01:04:52,782 --> 01:04:54,075
Now pull yourself together.

978
01:04:54,117 --> 01:04:55,410
She'll turn up,
the little cockroach.

979
01:04:55,452 --> 01:04:58,413
Get to the party
or they'll suspect something.

980
01:04:58,455 --> 01:04:59,747
I'll be down soon.

981
01:04:59,789 --> 01:05:01,249
Yes, Mother.

982
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:07,921
Everyone,

983
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:10,757
your attention, please.

984
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:18,932
Tonight we dance for
our treasured guest of honor--

985
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:19,933
Fester Addams.

986
01:05:23,562 --> 01:05:26,481
The mamushka.

987
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:29,942
Taught to us
by our Cossack cousins,

988
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:33,446
the mamushka has been
an Addams family tradition

989
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,156
since God knows when.

990
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:38,075
We danced the mamushka
while Nero fiddled.

991
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:40,203
We danced the mamushka

992
01:05:40,286 --> 01:05:41,871
at Waterloo.

993
01:05:41,954 --> 01:05:45,875
We danced the mamushka
for Jack the Ripper.

994
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:49,377
And now, Fester Addams,

995
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:53,882
this mamushka is for you.

996
01:06:15,486 --> 01:06:17,404
Where are you going?
There's trouble.

997
01:06:17,488 --> 01:06:19,406
Hey, not to worry.

998
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:20,407
Plan "B."

999
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:22,409
But that hideous
little girl knows--

1000
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:23,410
I'm in charge.

1001
01:06:23,494 --> 01:06:25,412
10 minutes, I'll be back.

1002
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:34,269
Wait!

1003
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:06,467
What the hell's
going on over there?

1004
01:08:06,509 --> 01:08:10,471
How would you like
to be rid of the Addamses

1005
01:08:10,513 --> 01:08:11,472
for good?

1006
01:08:11,514 --> 01:08:12,973
I'm serious.

1007
01:08:13,015 --> 01:08:15,475
What can I do for you?

1008
01:08:16,518 --> 01:08:19,437
You are going to love this.

1009
01:08:22,023 --> 01:08:25,485
We've been married
for almost 20 years.

1010
01:08:25,527 --> 01:08:28,988
Sometimes it seems like more.

1011
01:08:32,367 --> 01:08:34,994
Well, people grow.

1012
01:08:35,036 --> 01:08:36,411
People change.

1013
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:48,924
Isn't it a beautiful night?

1014
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:56,432
Come see me before you leave.

1015
01:08:56,514 --> 01:08:58,891
I'll call once I'm alone.

1016
01:08:58,975 --> 01:09:00,435
There's your ride, girls.

1017
01:09:12,405 --> 01:09:14,365
You're a marvelous dancer.

1018
01:09:14,407 --> 01:09:16,451
It's been such fun.

1019
01:09:19,536 --> 01:09:22,456
I can't. We mustn't.

1020
01:09:28,587 --> 01:09:30,213
Call me.

1021
01:09:45,478 --> 01:09:46,437
Gordon.

1022
01:09:47,646 --> 01:09:48,606
Gordon, stop it.

1023
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:51,442
Stop it, Gordon.

1024
01:09:51,525 --> 01:09:53,235
Stop it this instant.

1025
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:56,405
Is that lipstick
all overyour face?

1026
01:09:56,489 --> 01:09:58,449
From the twins.

1027
01:09:58,491 --> 01:10:00,950
The beauteous Amor twins.

1028
01:10:00,992 --> 01:10:02,744
The twins?

1029
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:04,245
Gordon, I don't understand.

1030
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,790
Have you been having
a good time?

1031
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:09,417
Yes! I have!

1032
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:10,960
It was marvelous.

1033
01:10:11,002 --> 01:10:12,962
I sang up a storm

1034
01:10:13,004 --> 01:10:14,881
and danced till I dropped.

1035
01:10:14,964 --> 01:10:17,926
The mamushka!

1036
01:10:18,009 --> 01:10:18,968
The mamushka!

1037
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,969
And a hey! And a hey!

1038
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:23,472
And a hey! And a hey! And a hey!

1039
01:10:26,016 --> 01:10:26,975
Mother.

1040
01:10:27,017 --> 01:10:29,269
Mother? Mother? Who is that?

1041
01:10:29,353 --> 01:10:31,313
I don't think I recall.

1042
01:10:31,355 --> 01:10:32,439
Mother, please.

1043
01:10:32,523 --> 01:10:33,774
I'm just fine.

1044
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:34,817
I'm dandy.

1045
01:10:34,858 --> 01:10:37,236
Don't concern yourself
about me, Gordon.

1046
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:40,906
Please, return
to your depraved orgy.

1047
01:10:40,989 --> 01:10:44,408
Sometimes I think
you're not even my son.

1048
01:10:44,492 --> 01:10:45,910
Don't say that.

1049
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:47,411
I'm just your mother.

1050
01:10:47,495 --> 01:10:51,415
You only owe me your entire
existence on this planet.

1051
01:10:51,499 --> 01:10:53,418
Please, Gordon, by all means,

1052
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:55,420
go sing, dance, date.

1053
01:10:55,503 --> 01:10:58,423
Oh, Mother, I'm so terribly sorry.

1054
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,427
It was just a party.

1055
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:04,928
It's over.

1056
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,930
It means nothing.

1057
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,433
The siamese twins, the hunchback,

1058
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:10,934
Cousin It--

1059
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,978
They're not you.

1060
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,479
Say it, Gordon.

1061
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:15,981
Make me believe it.

1062
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,482
I love you.

1063
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:20,485
And I want money.

1064
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,487
We've got to find Tully.

1065
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,660
Look, our little boy.

1066
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,954
All tuckered out.

1067
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:33,456
It's so sweet.

1068
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:37,376
He looks just like a little entree.

1069
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,211
Where's the party?

1070
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,713
It's over, darling.

1071
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,548
Have you seen your sister?

1072
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,175
Not since before the mamushka.

1073
01:11:45,216 --> 01:11:47,302
Gomez.

1074
01:11:47,385 --> 01:11:48,303
Fan out.

1075
01:11:48,386 --> 01:11:50,305
Pugsley, head for the dung heap.

1076
01:11:50,388 --> 01:11:52,348
Mama and Morticia,
the shallow graves.

1077
01:11:52,432 --> 01:11:53,892
I'll take the abyss.

1078
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:55,977
Lurch, check out
the bottomless pit.

1079
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:56,978
Fester?

1080
01:11:57,061 --> 01:11:57,979
Up here!

1081
01:11:58,062 --> 01:12:00,190
Fester, you take the ravine

1082
01:12:00,273 --> 01:12:02,901
and the unmarked abandoned well.

1083
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:04,903
Someone should stay behind

1084
01:12:04,986 --> 01:12:07,404
in case she comes back.

1085
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:09,907
Good man. Good thinking.

1086
01:12:09,948 --> 01:12:11,200
Then who'll take the swamp?

1087
01:12:15,495 --> 01:12:17,038
That's the spirit, Thing.

1088
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:18,164
Lend a hand.

1089
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:19,165
Let's go.

1090
01:12:26,297 --> 01:12:28,215
Gordon!

1091
01:12:28,256 --> 01:12:29,716
Don't dawdle.

1092
01:12:41,937 --> 01:12:43,438
What are you doing?

1093
01:12:43,522 --> 01:12:44,940
I'm relaxing.

1094
01:12:45,023 --> 01:12:46,441
Taking a little sun.

1095
01:12:46,525 --> 01:12:48,859
Have you gone mad?

1096
01:12:48,943 --> 01:12:51,278
Au contraire.

1097
01:12:57,952 --> 01:13:00,413
Wednesday!

1098
01:13:02,957 --> 01:13:04,917
Wednesday!

1099
01:13:07,461 --> 01:13:08,963
Wednesday!

1100
01:13:10,463 --> 01:13:11,923
Wednesday!

1101
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:49,960
What is all this?

1102
01:13:50,043 --> 01:13:53,004
This is a restraining order.

1103
01:13:53,045 --> 01:13:54,380
Restraining order?

1104
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:56,591
Yes. It requires you
to keep a distance

1105
01:13:56,674 --> 01:13:59,177
of 1,000 yards from this house.

1106
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,888
I am restrained from my own house?

1107
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:03,389
Not your house, mustache.

1108
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:04,766
Not anymore.

1109
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:07,894
It belongs to the oldest
living descendant,

1110
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:11,314
the elder brother--
Fester Addams.

1111
01:14:11,397 --> 01:14:12,856
Fester adores Gomez.

1112
01:14:12,898 --> 01:14:14,232
He's afraid of him.

1113
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,151
Seeing the twins brought it back.

1114
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:17,652
You're bitter rivals.

1115
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:19,905
I demand to speak with Fester.

1116
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,406
Sorry. No can do.

1117
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,783
He's very hurt.

1118
01:14:22,866 --> 01:14:24,493
Just leave.

1119
01:14:26,286 --> 01:14:28,914
But he isn't even Uncle Fester.

1120
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,418
Have no fear.

1121
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,920
Justice shall prevail.

1122
01:14:36,003 --> 01:14:37,838
The courts will decide.

1123
01:14:37,922 --> 01:14:40,382
They say a man
who represents himself

1124
01:14:40,424 --> 01:14:42,510
has a fool for a client.

1125
01:14:42,593 --> 01:14:45,137
Well, with God as my witness,

1126
01:14:45,221 --> 01:14:48,015
I am that fool!

1127
01:14:48,057 --> 01:14:51,018
Therefore,
it is with no small amount

1128
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,561
of personal satisfaction

1129
01:14:52,603 --> 01:14:54,563
that I declare Fester Addams

1130
01:14:54,605 --> 01:14:57,190
legal executor of the Addams estate

1131
01:14:57,273 --> 01:15:01,361
and rightful owner
of all possessions

1132
01:15:01,444 --> 01:15:03,029
and properties contained therein

1133
01:15:03,113 --> 01:15:04,697
with one exception.

1134
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:07,075
Gomez Addams,

1135
01:15:07,158 --> 01:15:11,704
I believe these are yours.

1136
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:45,376
- Aah!
- Aah!

1137
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:51,674
You are doing this on purpose.

1138
01:16:51,758 --> 01:16:53,843
That's right, Mother.
Isn't this fun?

1139
01:16:53,927 --> 01:16:55,345
I'll race you back.

1140
01:16:57,055 --> 01:16:59,849
Yes, we've been
forced from our home.

1141
01:16:59,933 --> 01:17:03,352
Yes, we've been betrayed
by those we trusted,

1142
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:05,854
but we are Addamses,

1143
01:17:05,938 --> 01:17:08,857
and we will not submit.

1144
01:17:08,941 --> 01:17:10,359
Who recalls the fable

1145
01:17:10,442 --> 01:17:12,861
of the tortoise and the hare--

1146
01:17:12,945 --> 01:17:15,864
the swift yet lazy
little cottontail

1147
01:17:15,948 --> 01:17:18,867
and his slow
but determined companion?

1148
01:17:18,951 --> 01:17:21,370
What does this story teach us?

1149
01:17:21,453 --> 01:17:22,870
Kill the hare!

1150
01:17:22,954 --> 01:17:24,288
Skin it. Boil it.

1151
01:17:24,372 --> 01:17:26,499
Put the tortoise on the highway.

1152
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,542
During rush hour.

1153
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:28,709
Yes.

1154
01:17:28,793 --> 01:17:30,711
We will survive.

1155
01:17:30,795 --> 01:17:32,046
Poison us.

1156
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:34,006
Strangle us.

1157
01:17:34,048 --> 01:17:35,508
Break our bones.

1158
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,385
We will come back for more.

1159
01:17:37,468 --> 01:17:39,220
And why?

1160
01:17:39,303 --> 01:17:40,847
Because we like it.

1161
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:42,890
Because we're Addamses.

1162
01:17:42,932 --> 01:17:44,307
We're Addamses.

1163
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:52,899
Here, Lurch.

1164
01:17:52,983 --> 01:17:54,735
On the house.

1165
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:14,795
We have so many homemakers
reentering the workforce.

1166
01:18:14,879 --> 01:18:17,423
Your domestic skills
can be very valuable.

1167
01:18:17,506 --> 01:18:18,966
Uh, college?

1168
01:18:19,049 --> 01:18:21,010
Private tutors.

1169
01:18:21,051 --> 01:18:22,762
Major?

1170
01:18:22,845 --> 01:18:23,971
Spells and hexes.

1171
01:18:25,222 --> 01:18:26,347
Liberal arts.

1172
01:18:26,431 --> 01:18:29,309
What about your husband?

1173
01:18:29,392 --> 01:18:30,727
Is he currently employed?

1174
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:34,230
He's going through
a bad patch at the moment,

1175
01:18:34,314 --> 01:18:36,441
but it's not his fault.

1176
01:18:36,524 --> 01:18:38,568
Of course not.

1177
01:18:38,651 --> 01:18:41,279
What is he, a loafer?

1178
01:18:41,362 --> 01:18:42,947
A hopeless layabout?

1179
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:44,616
A shiftless dreamer?

1180
01:18:45,867 --> 01:18:47,534
Not anymore.

1181
01:18:52,539 --> 01:18:55,292
Is this made from real lemons?

1182
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:57,044
Yes.

1183
01:18:57,086 --> 01:18:59,046
I only like all-natural
fruits and beverages,

1184
01:18:59,088 --> 01:19:02,800
organically grown
with no preservatives.

1185
01:19:02,883 --> 01:19:04,510
Are you sure they're real lemons?

1186
01:19:04,593 --> 01:19:05,803
Yes.

1187
01:19:05,886 --> 01:19:08,262
Well, I'll tell you what.

1188
01:19:08,346 --> 01:19:11,265
I'll buy a cup if you buy a box

1189
01:19:11,349 --> 01:19:13,810
of my delicious
Girl Scout cookies. Deal?

1190
01:19:13,893 --> 01:19:16,270
Are they made from real Girl Scouts?

1191
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,701
And, so, the witch
lured Hansel and Gretel

1192
01:19:31,785 --> 01:19:33,245
into the candy house

1193
01:19:33,286 --> 01:19:35,372
by promising them more sweets.

1194
01:19:35,455 --> 01:19:37,374
She told them to look in the oven.

1195
01:19:37,457 --> 01:19:39,668
She was about to push them in

1196
01:19:39,751 --> 01:19:41,420
when, lo and behold,

1197
01:19:41,503 --> 01:19:44,965
Hansel pushed
the poor, defenseless witch

1198
01:19:45,006 --> 01:19:46,466
into the oven instead

1199
01:19:46,508 --> 01:19:48,844
where she was burned alive,

1200
01:19:48,927 --> 01:19:50,761
writhing in agony.

1201
01:19:53,848 --> 01:19:55,850
Now, boys and girls,

1202
01:19:55,933 --> 01:19:58,978
what do you think that feels like?

1203
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:26,755
Ooh!

1204
01:20:52,029 --> 01:20:53,446
Welcome to the show.

1205
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:55,948
Voodoo witch doctors
in the United States--

1206
01:20:56,032 --> 01:20:57,450
Here, kitty-kitty.

1207
01:20:57,533 --> 01:20:58,951
Do they really exist

1208
01:20:59,035 --> 01:21:01,287
or is this just tabloid hooey?

1209
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:03,915
We'd love you to call in
with your comments.

1210
01:21:06,042 --> 01:21:09,629
After lunch, we'll try again.

1211
01:21:09,712 --> 01:21:11,172
Yes, Mother.

1212
01:21:15,383 --> 01:21:17,803
We'll find the money.

1213
01:21:17,886 --> 01:21:19,971
Meanwhile, we have this little nest,

1214
01:21:20,055 --> 01:21:21,640
quiet and cozy,

1215
01:21:21,723 --> 01:21:24,976
without that dreadful family.

1216
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:27,729
Yes, Mother.

1217
01:21:27,813 --> 01:21:29,231
You claim that your son

1218
01:21:29,314 --> 01:21:31,733
was brainwashed
by voodoo witch doctors

1219
01:21:31,817 --> 01:21:34,486
and forced to recruit others.

1220
01:21:34,569 --> 01:21:36,112
Let's take a call.

1221
01:21:36,195 --> 01:21:37,655
Hello, Sally.

1222
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:40,449
Mr. Addams, please stop calling.

1223
01:21:40,533 --> 01:21:42,910
We do not know where they meet.

1224
01:21:42,993 --> 01:21:44,370
Let's take another call.

1225
01:21:46,747 --> 01:21:49,417
Gomez, why don't we go for a drive?

1226
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,918
The whole family.

1227
01:21:51,001 --> 01:21:52,753
A drive?

1228
01:21:52,837 --> 01:21:54,672
And miss Gilligan?

1229
01:21:54,755 --> 01:21:56,298
Dinner's going to be late.

1230
01:21:56,382 --> 01:21:58,883
Here, boy. Here, boy.

1231
01:22:06,516 --> 01:22:08,601
Gordon.

1232
01:22:08,685 --> 01:22:10,437
Gordon!

1233
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:20,295
I would like to speak
with Fester, please.

1234
01:23:29,011 --> 01:23:30,763
You're a desperate woman

1235
01:23:30,846 --> 01:23:33,474
consumed by greed and bitterness.

1236
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:35,768
We could have been such friends.

1237
01:23:35,851 --> 01:23:37,311
Gordon, let's get started.

1238
01:23:37,353 --> 01:23:38,437
But, Mother--

1239
01:23:38,521 --> 01:23:39,605
Stop stalling.

1240
01:23:39,688 --> 01:23:41,107
I'm not stalling,

1241
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:42,607
and stop badgering me.

1242
01:23:44,692 --> 01:23:46,111
The vault, Mrs. Addams--

1243
01:23:46,194 --> 01:23:48,029
Any thoughts?

1244
01:23:48,113 --> 01:23:49,114
None whatsoever.

1245
01:23:49,197 --> 01:23:50,907
Tully, take over. Tighten it.

1246
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:53,451
I got this stomach thing
when I torture people.

1247
01:23:53,535 --> 01:23:55,036
Do it.

1248
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:58,248
Again.

1249
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:03,085
Ooh!

1250
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:08,507
Tighter.

1251
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:11,802
Ah!

1252
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:14,304
You've done this before.

1253
01:25:01,808 --> 01:25:03,393
Who is it?

1254
01:25:03,477 --> 01:25:06,063
We're paid through Thursday.

1255
01:25:06,104 --> 01:25:08,647
Mor-Morticia.

1256
01:25:08,731 --> 01:25:10,066
Morticia...

1257
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:11,650
Morticia what?

1258
01:25:11,734 --> 01:25:14,028
Slow down!

1259
01:25:14,111 --> 01:25:15,488
It's terrible when you stutter.

1260
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,543
Morticia...

1261
01:25:30,627 --> 01:25:32,629
in...

1262
01:25:32,712 --> 01:25:34,547
danger. Stop.

1263
01:25:34,631 --> 01:25:37,300
Send help...

1264
01:25:37,384 --> 01:25:39,844
at once. Stop!

1265
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:42,889
You can't!

1266
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:45,392
Not with red-hot pokers!

1267
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:46,726
Is this gonna smell?

1268
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:47,977
Tully Alford--

1269
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:49,186
charlatan,

1270
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:50,396
deadbeat,

1271
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:52,231
parasite.

1272
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,691
How Gomez adored you.

1273
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:57,152
Well, not enough.

1274
01:25:57,236 --> 01:25:58,654
Morticia.

1275
01:25:59,947 --> 01:26:01,115
Please.

1276
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,409
And, dear Fester,

1277
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,411
which is the real you--

1278
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:08,914
the loathsome, underhanded
monster you've become

1279
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,915
or the loathsome,
underhanded monster

1280
01:26:10,998 --> 01:26:12,542
we came to love?

1281
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:14,627
Don't ask me.

1282
01:26:31,685 --> 01:26:34,104
I know what you're feeling, Fester.

1283
01:26:34,146 --> 01:26:35,105
Gordon!

1284
01:26:35,147 --> 01:26:37,274
Gordon, I have a thought.

1285
01:26:37,357 --> 01:26:40,277
Just a notion, top of my head.

1286
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,279
Tell me what you think.

1287
01:26:42,362 --> 01:26:47,993
Since you and Mrs. Addams
are so very close...

1288
01:26:48,076 --> 01:26:50,078
be my guest.

1289
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:52,788
Addams!

1290
01:26:52,872 --> 01:26:54,081
Cara mia!

1291
01:26:54,165 --> 01:26:55,458
Mon cher!

1292
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:57,209
Darling, take care.

1293
01:26:57,293 --> 01:27:00,212
Dirty pool, old man.

1294
01:27:00,296 --> 01:27:01,338
Never again!

1295
01:27:12,183 --> 01:27:14,476
One for you, Tully,

1296
01:27:14,559 --> 01:27:16,895
and now...

1297
01:27:26,613 --> 01:27:28,615
one for me.

1298
01:27:28,698 --> 01:27:29,741
Gomez, I'm on retainer.

1299
01:27:29,824 --> 01:27:31,367
Let him up.

1300
01:27:41,043 --> 01:27:42,252
That's right.

1301
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,587
Now get moving, Addams.

1302
01:27:46,799 --> 01:27:48,467
Take him to the vault,

1303
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:52,721
and if you're not back
in one hour...

1304
01:27:52,805 --> 01:27:55,515
I displace her.

1305
01:27:59,268 --> 01:28:02,188
Tish, seeing you like this,

1306
01:28:02,271 --> 01:28:04,273
my blood boils.

1307
01:28:04,357 --> 01:28:05,691
As does mine.

1308
01:28:05,775 --> 01:28:08,361
This wheel of pain...

1309
01:28:08,444 --> 01:28:09,612
Our wheel.

1310
01:28:09,695 --> 01:28:12,949
To live without you--
only that would be torture.

1311
01:28:13,032 --> 01:28:14,450
A day alone--

1312
01:28:14,534 --> 01:28:17,494
only that would be death.

1313
01:28:19,663 --> 01:28:21,123
Knock it off.

1314
01:28:22,207 --> 01:28:24,960
The vault, Addams, right now.

1315
01:28:34,428 --> 01:28:35,804
But, Mother, you can't--

1316
01:28:35,887 --> 01:28:37,805
Can it, Gordon.

1317
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,890
Stop dragging your feet.

1318
01:28:39,974 --> 01:28:41,183
You disgust me!

1319
01:28:41,267 --> 01:28:44,186
You're nothing
but a useless, sniveling baby,

1320
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:46,188
a stone around my neck.

1321
01:28:46,272 --> 01:28:47,690
What was I thinking?

1322
01:28:47,773 --> 01:28:51,986
I should have left you
where I found you.

1323
01:28:52,069 --> 01:28:54,405
No tricks, Gomez.

1324
01:28:55,656 --> 01:28:57,450
That's the wrong book.

1325
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:07,751
Allow me.

1326
01:29:10,587 --> 01:29:12,547
Good show, old man.

1327
01:29:14,507 --> 01:29:17,135
Put that book down, Gordon.

1328
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:19,720
You don't know what it can do.

1329
01:29:19,803 --> 01:29:21,138
It's not just literature.

1330
01:29:21,221 --> 01:29:22,806
Oh, really?

1331
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,894
Quickly, darling.

1332
01:29:26,977 --> 01:29:28,228
Gordon, I'm your friend.

1333
01:29:28,312 --> 01:29:30,022
Think of the doubloons.

1334
01:29:30,105 --> 01:29:32,900
They're not yours, Tully.

1335
01:29:32,983 --> 01:29:34,485
Back off.

1336
01:29:34,568 --> 01:29:35,903
Leather straps.

1337
01:29:35,986 --> 01:29:37,279
Red-hot pokers.

1338
01:29:37,362 --> 01:29:39,573
Later, my dearest.

1339
01:29:39,656 --> 01:29:42,700
Keep the book closed.
Listen to Mother.

1340
01:29:42,784 --> 01:29:44,702
I'll never listen to you,

1341
01:29:44,786 --> 01:29:46,245
never ever again.

1342
01:29:46,329 --> 01:29:49,999
I had to be strict with you
because I cared. Put it down!

1343
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:52,001
You never really loved me.

1344
01:29:52,085 --> 01:29:53,836
Fester, this way!

1345
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,507
Stop whining, you little
good-for-nothing. Be a man!

1346
01:29:57,590 --> 01:30:01,010
You were a terrible mother!

1347
01:30:01,094 --> 01:30:04,054
There! I said it.

1348
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:14,606
Aah!

1349
01:30:54,728 --> 01:30:56,521
Are they dead?

1350
01:30:56,563 --> 01:30:58,523
Does it matter?

1351
01:31:16,498 --> 01:31:18,208
Trick or--

1352
01:31:18,292 --> 01:31:22,254
- Aah!
- Aah!

1353
01:31:22,337 --> 01:31:24,548
Here we come.

1354
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:26,382
Pugsley, old man.

1355
01:31:26,466 --> 01:31:28,718
Why, look at you.

1356
01:31:31,763 --> 01:31:33,556
How do you like it?

1357
01:31:33,639 --> 01:31:36,809
What can I say?

1358
01:31:36,893 --> 01:31:38,352
He's gonna break hearts.

1359
01:31:38,394 --> 01:31:40,104
Trick or treat.

1360
01:31:42,648 --> 01:31:43,816
Hello, Margaret.

1361
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,026
Cousin It.

1362
01:31:45,109 --> 01:31:47,027
I almost didn't recognize you.

1363
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,487
Isn't he handsome?

1364
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:51,907
Everyone keeps asking
where he bought his costume.

1365
01:31:51,948 --> 01:31:53,367
It is a wonderful hat.

1366
01:31:54,743 --> 01:31:57,788
What are you, darling?
Where's your costume?

1367
01:31:57,871 --> 01:31:59,289
This is my costume.

1368
01:31:59,373 --> 01:32:00,665
I'm a homicidal maniac.

1369
01:32:00,749 --> 01:32:03,293
They look just like everyone else.

1370
01:32:06,129 --> 01:32:07,547
I'm so glad

1371
01:32:07,631 --> 01:32:10,549
I can spend this night
with my family

1372
01:32:10,633 --> 01:32:13,803
now that I've got my memory back.

1373
01:32:13,886 --> 01:32:15,679
Thank God for that lightning.

1374
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,973
Knocked some sense into you.

1375
01:32:20,267 --> 01:32:22,436
You remember, old man.

1376
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,939
Dr. Pinder-Schloss
really did find Fester

1377
01:32:25,022 --> 01:32:27,692
tangled in a tuna net
25 years ago,

1378
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:29,192
with amnesia.

1379
01:32:29,275 --> 01:32:31,695
From the Bermuda Triangle.

1380
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:36,199
How true.

1381
01:32:36,282 --> 01:32:38,368
Stranger things have happened.

1382
01:32:38,451 --> 01:32:40,120
Please, Uncle Fester.

1383
01:32:40,203 --> 01:32:41,496
Pugsley.

1384
01:32:41,579 --> 01:32:42,789
For the picture.

1385
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:52,047
All right, everybody,

1386
01:32:52,131 --> 01:32:53,757
time for a game.

1387
01:32:53,841 --> 01:32:55,134
What shall it be?

1388
01:32:55,217 --> 01:32:56,760
Bobbing for apples?

1389
01:32:56,844 --> 01:32:57,803
Charades?

1390
01:32:59,221 --> 01:33:01,515
Of course. Wake the dead.

1391
01:33:01,598 --> 01:33:03,767
Wake the dead!

1392
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:05,310
Wake the dead!

1393
01:33:05,394 --> 01:33:07,271
Out to the cemetery.

1394
01:33:07,354 --> 01:33:09,148
I've never played this before.

1395
01:33:09,231 --> 01:33:10,649
How does it go?

1396
01:33:10,733 --> 01:33:12,483
Did you bring a shovel?

1397
01:33:12,567 --> 01:33:14,819
Uncle Fester, be on my team.

1398
01:33:14,902 --> 01:33:15,987
No. Mine.

1399
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:18,156
We'll give you a head start--

1400
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:19,991
three skulls and a pelvis.

1401
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:25,121
My own dear brother.

1402
01:33:32,419 --> 01:33:34,171
Ha ha ha ha!

1403
01:33:34,254 --> 01:33:35,630
Come on.

1404
01:33:35,672 --> 01:33:37,007
We'll catch up.

1405
01:33:40,218 --> 01:33:42,137
Wake the dead!

1406
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:44,139
Wake the dead!

1407
01:33:44,222 --> 01:33:47,642
Uncle Atlas, wake up.

1408
01:33:47,684 --> 01:33:49,144
Come on, Aunt LaBorgia,

1409
01:33:49,227 --> 01:33:50,312
wake up.

1410
01:33:50,395 --> 01:33:52,814
No, children.
You have to dig.

1411
01:33:52,898 --> 01:33:55,441
That's half the fun.

1412
01:34:06,077 --> 01:34:07,578
Oh, Tish,

1413
01:34:07,661 --> 01:34:09,038
what more could we ask?

1414
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:13,167
Gomez...

1415
01:34:18,546 --> 01:34:22,384
Cara mia, is it true?

1416
01:34:22,467 --> 01:34:25,929
Oui...mon amour.

1417
01:34:36,355 --> 01:34:38,273
Wake up, Grandpa Addams.

1418
01:34:38,357 --> 01:34:39,525
It's Halloween.

1419
01:34:39,566 --> 01:34:40,609
Children, look!

1420
01:34:40,693 --> 01:34:42,111
Great-aunt Lavinia!

1421
01:34:42,194 --> 01:34:44,697
She was beheaded
by her own children.

1422
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,615
- Yay!
- Yay!

1423
01:35:07,677 --> 01:35:09,262
You rang?

1424
01:37:23,181 --> 01:37:24,598
Thank you, buster.

1425
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,934
Oh, yeah.

1426
01:37:26,976 --> 01:37:28,102
Yeah!

1427
01:37:28,144 --> 01:37:31,605
This is the Addams groove
right here. Ah-ha!

1428
01:37:33,816 --> 01:37:35,192
Just like that.

1429
01:37:35,276 --> 01:37:36,861
Oh, yeah.

1430
01:37:36,944 --> 01:37:39,280
You know, you got
to feel this thing.

1431
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,126
I'm telling you,

1432
01:37:53,168 --> 01:37:55,628
I saw that hand, that thing, man.

1433
01:38:03,428 --> 01:38:04,637
The Addams.

1434
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:07,639
Yeah, thank you, Fester.

1435
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:10,642
I need to go back
to the bridge here.

1436
01:38:12,895 --> 01:38:13,937
Hah!

1437
01:38:15,773 --> 01:38:17,149
Just like that.

1438
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:18,317
Oh, yeah.

1439
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:21,653
You know, you got
to feel this thing.

1440
01:38:33,706 --> 01:38:35,166
I'm telling you,

1441
01:38:35,208 --> 01:38:37,919
I saw the hand, that thing, man.

1442
01:39:01,525 --> 01:39:03,610
Cousin It got on the floor,

1443
01:39:03,694 --> 01:39:05,612
and he got to wigglin'
and wobblin',

1444
01:39:05,696 --> 01:39:06,947
and he did this move.

1445
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:09,615
Everybody backed up,
you know what I'm saying?

1446
01:39:14,578 --> 01:39:18,374
I'm talking about the Addams.

1447
01:39:18,457 --> 01:39:19,917
You know what I'm saying?

1448
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,420
I'm talking about the Addams.
