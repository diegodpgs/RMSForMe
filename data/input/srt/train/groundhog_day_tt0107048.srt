1
00:00:55,018 --> 00:00:56,512
<i>Somebody asked me,</i>

2
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,020
<i>"Phil, if you could be anywhere,
where would you be?"</i>

3
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:02,811
<i>I said to him,
" Probably right here...</i>

4
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:06,152
<i>...EIko, Nevada."
Our nation's high at 79 today.</i>

5
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:09,068
<i>In California, they'll have
warm weather tomorrow...</i>

6
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:11,945
...gang wars and some
overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:15,037
<i>In the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some...</i>

8
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,955
...very, very tall trees.

9
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,745
Clear across the Rockies
and Great Plains.

10
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,409
But look out, here comes trouble.

11
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:25,621
Oh, boy!

12
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:28,007
Front coming our way!
Look out!

13
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:32,051
What will that mean to us?
One of these big blue things!

14
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:36,173
This cold, frigid arctic air,
this big mass out of the north.

15
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:40,387
<i>It'll meet up with all this
moisture out of the Gulf.</i>

16
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,019
<i>They'll mix at high altitudes
and cause snow.</i>

17
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:48,728
<i>It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It'll push off and hit Altoona.</i>

18
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:50,026
Close call!

19
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:51,942
<i>Let's look at the five-day.</i>

20
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:55,571
As you can see, nothing to be
too scared about.

21
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,531
Bundle up warm, but you can
leave your galoshes at home.

22
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,501
<i>I won't be here at 10:00.
Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.</i>

23
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:07,249
<i>I'll be in Punxsutawney for our
country's oldest Groundhog Festival.</i>

24
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:10,711
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2nd...

25
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,716
...if the groundhog wakes
and sees his shadow...

26
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,053
<i>...we've got six more weeks
of winter.</i>

27
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,381
Sounds like fun.

28
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:21,177
You must really enjoy it.
This is your third year in a row.

29
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:22,683
Four, Nan.

30
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:23,888
Four.

31
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:25,312
Thanks, Phil.

32
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:30,236
Next, our entertainment editor
looks at sex and violence in movies.

33
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:31,568
Stay with us.

34
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,691
<i>We're clear.</i>

35
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:37,826
Have fun in Punxsutawney.

36
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,825
For your information, Hairdo,
a major network is interested in me.

37
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,707
That would be the
Home Shopping Network.

38
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,759
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

39
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:53,834
<i>That was nice, Phil.
" Big trees"!</i>

40
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:54,961
Stop, Kenny.

41
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,849
Look, can you handle
the 10:00 or not?

42
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:02,228
<i>If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.</i>

43
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,433
Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?
Please!

44
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:07,897
<i>Rita thinks it'd be
a great idea...</i>

45
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:11,520
<i>...to stay for other events.
You'll get incredible footage.</i>

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,105
The people and the fun.
The excitement!

47
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:17,533
<i>You haven't worked with her yet.
She's really nice.</i>

48
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:20,911
<i>I think she'll be
a really good producer.</i>

49
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:23,572
You guys are going to have fun.

50
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,041
<i>She's fun. But not my kind of fun.
I'll be here for the 5:00.</i>

51
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:34,151
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

52
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,862
<i>I'm probably leaving PBH.</i>

53
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:39,946
So this will be the last time...

54
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:41,780
...we do the Groundhog together.

55
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:45,291
<i>What's wrong with
the Groundhog Festival?</i>

56
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,620
In San Diego...

57
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,541
...I covered the swallows returning
to Capistrano for six years.

58
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:55,377
Someone will see me interview
a groundhog and think I have no future.

59
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:57,669
<i>I think it's a nice story.</i>

60
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:00,715
He comes out.
He looks around.

61
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:02,675
He wrinkles up his nose.

62
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:06,717
<i>He sees his shadow or not.
It's nice! People like it!</i>

63
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,351
<i>You are new, aren't you?</i>

64
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:12,224
People like blood sausage too.

65
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:13,981
People are morons!

66
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:16,236
Nice attitude.

67
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:20,818
Look in the mirror and see how you
look when you do that groundhog thing.

68
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:22,239
For me? Once?

69
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:26,237
He comes out, and there he
looks at his little shadow.

70
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,540
Want some blood sausage?
I have some...

71
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:31,661
I like blood sausage.

72
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,480
<i>Rita, I can't stay here.</i>

73
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,270
Prima donna.

74
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:37,734
<i>- What's the matter?
- I hate this place.</i>

75
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,614
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserable.

76
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:43,444
<i>- I won't stay here.
- You're not staying here.</i>

77
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:44,816
<i>I'm not?</i>

78
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:47,073
<i>Larry's dropping me off.</i>

79
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:49,861
I booked you in
a nice bed and breakfast.

80
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,073
Great.

81
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:56,501
I think this is one of the traits
of a good producer.

82
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:58,457
Keep the talent happy.

83
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:00,163
Anything I can do.

84
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:02,959
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

85
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,507
Within reason. Want to come
to dinner with Larry and me?

86
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:11,931
<i>No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.</i>

87
00:07:14,357 --> 00:07:17,061
You get your sleep.
See you in the morning.

88
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,319
<i>Don't be late.</i>

89
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:24,105
<i>Did he actually call himself
"the talent"?</i>

90
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:55,846
<i>Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties,</i>

91
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:58,894
<i>- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day!</i>

92
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,399
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

93
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:04,441
<i>Expect hazardous travel
later today with,,,</i>

94
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:06,110
<i>,,, that blizzard thing,</i>

95
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,487
<i>That blizzard thing,
Here's the report,</i>

96
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:14,075
<i>The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing,</i>

97
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,079
<i>There's another reason
today's especially ex citing...</i>

98
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:19,038
<i>Especially cold,</i>

99
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,711
<i>The big question
on everybody's lips...</i>

100
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:24,635
<i>- Their chapped lips,
- On their chapped lips,</i>

101
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:27,465
<i>Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?</i>

102
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:31,007
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

103
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:32,678
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

104
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:35,972
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

105
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:41,188
- Morning!
- Morning.

106
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:43,520
- Off to see the groundhog?
- I am.

107
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:45,814
<i>Think it'll be an early spring?</i>

108
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:48,108
<i>I'm predicting March 21 st.</i>

109
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:50,577
Good guess!

110
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:54,453
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

111
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:05,712
- Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
- I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

112
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,214
Like some coffee?

113
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:12,932
Is there any possibility of getting
an espresso or cappuccino?

114
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,135
<i>I really don't know...</i>

115
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:18,971
How to spell espresso or cappuccino.
This looks fine.

116
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:21,390
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

117
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:24,901
<i>- I'm sure I will.
- There's talk of a blizzard.</i>

118
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:28,655
We may catch a break and
it will blow right by.

119
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:31,067
The moisture coming
out of the south...

120
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,534
...by midday will
push on to the east.

121
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:38,741
<i>At high altitudes it'll crystallize
and give us what we call snow.</i>

122
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,744
Our high will get to
about 30 today, teens tonight.

123
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:46,712
Chance of precipitation,
about 20% today, 20% tomorrow.

124
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:49,969
Did you want to talk about
the weather or just chitchat?

125
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:51,920
Chitchat.

126
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:53,724
See you later.

127
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,179
Will you be checking out today?

128
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,722
Chance of departure today, 100%.

129
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,913
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

130
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,422
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

131
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:34,174
<i>Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.</i>

132
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:36,339
Not a chance.

133
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,970
Ned!

134
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,764
Ryerson!

135
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:43,349
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

136
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:45,974
Come on, buddy,
Case Western High!

137
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:50,108
I did the whistling bellybutton
trick at the talent show.

138
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:55,241
<i>Bing! Got the shingles real bad
senior year. Almost didn't graduate.</i>

139
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:57,410
Bing again!

140
00:10:57,622 --> 00:11:01,702
I dated your sister a couple times
till you told me not to anymore.

141
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,199
Well?

142
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:04,911
Ned Ryerson?

143
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:06,120
Bing!

144
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:07,661
Bing.

145
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:11,426
Did you turn pro with
that bellybutton thing?

146
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:13,011
I sell insurance.

147
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:15,505
- What a shock.
- Do you have insurance?

148
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:17,681
If you do, you could
always use more.

149
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:20,514
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

150
00:11:22,355 --> 00:11:25,309
I would love to stand here
and talk with you.

151
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:26,806
<i>But I'm not going to.</i>

152
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:28,017
See you.

153
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:30,105
<i>That's all right!
I'll walk with you.</i>

154
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,239
I see an opportunity,
I charge it like a bull.

155
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,318
<i>Ned the Bull, that's me now.</i>

156
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:39,112
I got friends who live and die
by the actuarial tables.

157
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:42,409
<i>I say it's all one big
crapshoot anyhoo.</i>

158
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:47,537
Ever heard of single-premium life?
That could be the ticket for you.

159
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:49,208
Oh, God!

160
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:53,380
It is so good to see you!
What are you doing for dinner?

161
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:54,917
Something else.

162
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:58,637
<i>It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.</i>

163
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:06,431
<i>Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!</i>

164
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:36,424
Phil!

165
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:38,263
Phil, over here!

166
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:39,974
Where have you been?

167
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:41,767
It was horrible.

168
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:43,928
A giant leech got me.

169
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:46,763
<i>You're missing all the fun.
These people are great!</i>

170
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:50,642
Some of them partied all night.
They sing till they get cold.

171
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:53,482
Then they go sit by the fire
and get warm.

172
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:56,104
Then they come back
and sing some more!

173
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,741
<i>They're hicks, Rita.</i>

174
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,908
So did you sleep okay without me?

175
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:03,907
<i>You tossed and turned, didn't you?</i>

176
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:05,322
<i>You're incredible.</i>

177
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,782
Who told you?

178
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:10,082
<i>It's groundhog time.</i>

179
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,717
Okay.
On me in three...

180
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,635
...two, one.

181
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:23,342
Once a year, the eyes of the nation
turn to this tiny hamlet...

182
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,226
...to watch a master at work.

183
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,392
The master?

184
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:27,975
Punxsutawney Phil...

185
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:31,517
<i>...the world's most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.</i>

186
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,905
Who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.

187
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:38,825
The question we have
to ask ourselves is:

188
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:41,068
<i>" Does Phil feel lucky?"</i>

189
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:47,333
Every year, the guy comes with
a big stick and raps on the door.

190
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,294
They pull the little rat out,
talk to him.

191
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:53,831
<i>The rat talks back.
Then they tell us when it'll end.</i>

192
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:02,055
<i>Isn't he cute?</i>

193
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:07,517
Do you like the guys
with the prominent upper teeth?

194
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:21,946
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

195
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,619
...Punxsutawney Phil...

196
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,413
...the seer of seers...

197
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,618
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

198
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,826
...emerged reluctantly...

199
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,117
...but alertly...

200
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,377
...in Punxsutawney, PA...

201
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:37,288
...and stated in groundhog-ese...

202
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:39,709
<i>..." I definitely see a shadow."</i>

203
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:43,546
Sorry, folks.

204
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,381
Six more weeks of winter.

205
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:52,770
On me in three...

206
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:54,643
...two, one.

207
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,316
This is one time where
television fails...

208
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,401
...to capture the excitement
of a large squirrel...

209
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:02,856
...predicting the weather.

210
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:06,404
<i>I'm grateful to have been here.
From Punxsutawney...</i>

211
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:09,333
...this is Phil Connors.
So long.

212
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,700
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

213
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,498
<i>We got it.
I'm out of here.</i>

214
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,040
Prima donnas.

215
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,343
Oh, boy.
Take a look at this.

216
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,142
What is going on?

217
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:39,309
<i>I don't know. Perhaps that
blizzard we're not supposed to get.</i>

218
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:41,440
This is impossible.

219
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:46,451
Nobody honks this horn but me,
okay, pal?

220
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,344
Take it out of here.

221
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,183
<i>Commander, what's going on?</i>

222
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,561
<i>Nothing.
We're closing the road.</i>

223
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:18,398
<i>- Big blizzard moving in.
- It's a couple of flakes.</i>

224
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:21,310
<i>Don't you listen to the weather?</i>

225
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:23,524
I make the weather.

226
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:28,735
All this moisture from the Gulf
will push off to the east in Altoona.

227
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,445
You got that moisture on your head.

228
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:33,658
You can go back to Punxsutawney...

229
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:37,205
<i>...or you can freeze to death.
It's your choice.</i>

230
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,586
<i>So, what's it going to be?</i>

231
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,714
<i>I'm thinking.</i>

232
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:47,927
Come on, all the long-distance
lines are down?

233
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,225
What about the satellite?

234
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,385
Is it snowing in space?

235
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:57,892
<i>Don't you keep a line open
for emergencies or celebrities?</i>

236
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:02,395
<i>I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.</i>

237
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,402
Can you patch me through
on that line?

238
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,868
Could I have one more of these
with some booze in it?

239
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,580
I like it here.

240
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,040
Going to the groundhog dinner?

241
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:24,007
No, I had groundhog for lunch.

242
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:26,507
<i>Wasn't bad.
Tastes like chicken.</i>

243
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,634
You two run along.

244
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:32,008
Looking foxy tonight, man.

245
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,726
Is your troop selling
cookies again this year?

246
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,260
<i>That's so funny.</i>

247
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:38,982
So, what are you doing?

248
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,731
<i>I think I'll go back to my room...</i>

249
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:45,521
<i>...take a hot shower
and maybe read Hustler,</i>

250
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,150
Suit yourself.

251
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:06,881
Yo, mom.

252
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:08,844
<i>Isn't there any hot water?</i>

253
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:10,970
<i>Oh, no, there wouldn't be today.</i>

254
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,679
Of course not.
Silly me.

255
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,352
Sweet dreams.

256
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:42,163
<i>Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties,</i>

257
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,588
<i>- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day!</i>

258
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,668
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

259
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:51,212
<i>Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.</i>

260
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:52,931
<i>- With that blizzard thing,</i>

261
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,851
<i>That blizzard thing?
Here's the report,</i>

262
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,556
<i>The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing,</i>

263
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,774
<i>There's another reason
today's especially ex citing...</i>

264
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:06,024
<i>Especially cold,</i>

265
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,437
<i>The big question
on everybody's lips...</i>

266
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:11,236
<i>- Chapped lips.
- Their chapped lips,</i>

267
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:14,363
<i>Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?</i>

268
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,912
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

269
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,499
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

270
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:21,417
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

271
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,175
What the hell?

272
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:39,143
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

273
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,515
<i>Think it'll be an early spring?</i>

274
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,273
<i>Didn't we do this yesterday?</i>

275
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:47,360
<i>I don't know what you mean.</i>

276
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:50,272
<i>Don't mess with me, Pork Chop!</i>

277
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,741
<i>- What day is this?
- It's February 2nd.</i>

278
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:55,535
Groundhog Day.

279
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:01,373
<i>I'm sorry.
I thought it was yesterday.</i>

280
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:25,891
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

281
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:28,192
Did I sleep well?

282
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:30,146
Like some coffee?

283
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:33,074
<i>Yes, please.
I think I'll have a double.</i>

284
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,738
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

285
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,402
<i>There's talk of a blizzard.</i>

286
00:20:41,082 --> 00:20:43,240
Ever have déjà vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?

287
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:46,122
<i>I'll check with the kitchen.</i>

288
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:48,294
<i>That's okay.
Thank you.</i>

289
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:52,427
Will you be checking out today?

290
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:59,015
<i>I'd say the chance
of departure is 80 percent.</i>

291
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,934
75-80.

292
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,609
Excuse me!

293
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,644
<i>Excuse me.
Where's everybody going?</i>

294
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,697
<i>To Gobbler's Knob.</i>

295
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,152
<i>It's Groundhog Day.</i>

296
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:18,400
<i>It's still just once a year,
isn't it?</i>

297
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:33,040
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

298
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:35,543
My, oh my, Phil Connors!

299
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:39,718
<i>Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.</i>

300
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:42,424
- Well?
- Ned Ryerson?

301
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:46,019
Bing! First shot
right out of the box!

302
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:48,852
<i>So how's it going, old buddy?</i>

303
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,985
<i>I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?</i>

304
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:57,029
<i>It's funny you should mention
your health. Guess what I do now.</i>

305
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,276
Do you sell insurance?

306
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:02,412
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!

307
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:04,491
Do you have life insurance?

308
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:07,038
If you do, you could
always use more.

309
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,203
<i>Right! I mean, who couldn't?</i>

310
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,791
But you want to know something?

311
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:13,040
I gots a feeling...

312
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,960
<i>...you ain't got any.</i>

313
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:18,053
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

314
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:19,638
I got to go.

315
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:28,052
<i>Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!</i>

316
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:55,083
Phil! Over here!

317
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,929
- Where have you been?
- Rita. Do me a favour.

318
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:03,258
I need someone to give me a
good, hard slap in the face.

319
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:06,345
<i>How's that?</i>

320
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:07,391
Good!

321
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:11,347
<i>If you need help with the other cheek,
I'm right here.</i>

322
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:14,485
<i>Something's going on.</i>

323
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:17,447
<i>- Are you drunk or something?
- Drunk's more fun.</i>

324
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,690
Can I be serious with you
for a minute?

325
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:21,023
Can you?

326
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:23,069
<i>I'm being serious!</i>

327
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:27,326
<i>I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.</i>

328
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,788
<i>It's groundhog time.</i>

329
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:32,243
<i>See? I knew you'd say that!</i>

330
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:34,213
I really feel...

331
00:23:34,464 --> 00:23:35,875
...weird.

332
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:38,421
<i>Let's just do this.
Then we'll talk.</i>

333
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:42,215
All right, on me in three...

334
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,265
...two, one.

335
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,599
<i>Well, it's Groundhog Day...</i>

336
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:48,180
...again...

337
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:51,307
<i>...and that must mean we're
up here at Gobbler's Knob...</i>

338
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:55,313
<i>...waiting for the world's most famous
groundhoglweatherman...</i>

339
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:56,855
...Punxsutawney Phil...

340
00:23:57,112 --> 00:24:01,062
<i>...who's about to tell us how much more
winter to expect.</i>

341
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:08,164
This is a riot!

342
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,872
<i>Isn't he cute?</i>

343
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:17,871
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

344
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:21,800
...Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

345
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:24,883
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

346
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,098
...emerged reluctantly...

347
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,592
...but alertly in Punxsu...

348
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:34,145
Oh, my gosh!

349
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:38,727
<i>I know there's a blizzard.</i>

350
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:42,071
When will the long-distance
lines be repaired?

351
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,114
<i>What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.</i>

352
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,216
Morning!

353
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:48,014
Off to see the groundhog?

354
00:25:54,605 --> 00:25:56,681
Did you sleep well, Mr...

355
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:13,202
Phil Connors! I thought...

356
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,000
<i>Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you!</i>

357
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,288
<i>It's me, Ned! Ryerson!</i>

358
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:22,997
Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head!

359
00:26:27,346 --> 00:26:29,919
Phil! Over here!

360
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:34,262
<i>Can I talk to you?
It's not work-related.</i>

361
00:26:34,478 --> 00:26:37,395
- You never talk about work.
- We have to talk.

362
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:40,726
<i>- It's a creative meeting.
- We've got work to do!</i>

363
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:43,350
<i>I don't.
I've already done it twice.</i>

364
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:46,566
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

365
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:52,119
<i>- What's that all about?
- I don't know.</i>

366
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:53,948
Prima donnas.

367
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:58,538
More coffee?

368
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:02,584
Just the check, please.
These sticky buns are heaven.

369
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:04,292
<i>Aren't they?</i>

370
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:08,131
Just put that anywhere, pal!

371
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:09,923
Good save!

372
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:14,890
<i>Tell me why you're too sick to work.
It better be good.</i>

373
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:20,971
<i>I'm reliving the same day
over and over.</i>

374
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:23,683
Groundhog Day. Today.

375
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:27,445
<i>Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line.</i>

376
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,610
Really! This is the third time!

377
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:32,825
<i>It's like yesterday never happened!</i>

378
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:37,035
<i>I'm racking my brain trying to imagine
why you'd make this up.</i>

379
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,628
<i>I'm not making it up.
I'm asking for help!</i>

380
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:43,169
What do you want me to do?

381
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,714
<i>I don't know! You're a producer.
Come up with something.</i>

382
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:49,547
You should get
your head examined...

383
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:53,089
...if you expect me to believe
a stupid story like that!

384
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,098
Phil? Like the groundhog Phil?

385
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:58,007
Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil.

386
00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:00,846
Look out for your shadow, pal!

387
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:03,641
Morons, your bus is leaving!

388
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:08,353
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

389
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:13,157
<i>- Let's talk about it in Pittsburgh.
- I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.</i>

390
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:15,658
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard!

391
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:18,362
You said it was going
to hit Altoona.

392
00:28:18,582 --> 00:28:21,252
<i>I know that's what I said.</i>

393
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,958
I think you need help.

394
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:27,839
<i>That's what I've been saying.
I need help.</i>

395
00:28:28,717 --> 00:28:30,461
No spots.

396
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:33,175
No clots, no tumours.

397
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,806
No lesions.

398
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:36,593
No aneurisms.

399
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:38,393
At least none that I can see.

400
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:42,511
<i>If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you'll have to go into Pittsburgh.</i>

401
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:44,938
<i>I can't go into Pittsburgh.</i>

402
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:48,775
<i>- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
- I told you, there's a blizzard.</i>

403
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,233
Right. The blizzard!

404
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:53,159
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

405
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:55,279
A biopsy.

406
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:57,536
A psychiatrist.

407
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,744
<i>That's an unusual problem...</i>

408
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,080
...Mr. Connors.

409
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,582
Most of my work is with couples,
families. I have an alcoholic now.

410
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:13,671
You went to college, right?

411
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:16,213
<i>It wasn't veterinary
psychology, was it?</i>

412
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:19,428
<i>Didn't you take a course that
covered this stuff?</i>

413
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:22,135
Sort of, I guess.

414
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:25,558
Abnormal psychology.

415
00:29:25,983 --> 00:29:27,940
So...

416
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,350
...what do I do?

417
00:29:31,197 --> 00:29:32,525
We should meet again.

418
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:35,483
<i>How's tomorrow for you?</i>

419
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,621
Is that not good?

420
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:53,253
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

421
00:29:53,511 --> 00:29:55,503
I met a girl.

422
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:57,002
We ate lobster.

423
00:29:57,265 --> 00:29:59,257
Drank piña coladas.

424
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:02,055
At sunset, we made love
like sea otters.

425
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:08,223
That was a pretty good day.

426
00:30:08,484 --> 00:30:10,311
<i>Why couldn't I get that day...</i>

427
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:11,642
...over...

428
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:14,069
...and over and over?

429
00:30:14,365 --> 00:30:18,232
Some guys would look
at this glass and say:

430
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:19,911
<i>"That glass is half empty."</i>

431
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:23,946
<i>Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."</i>

432
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,542
<i>I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Right?</i>

433
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:32,880
What would you do if you were
stuck in one place...

434
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:37,048
...and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing you did mattered?

435
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,392
That about sums it up for me.

436
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:50,980
Good luck.

437
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:52,646
<i>I'll drop you off.</i>

438
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:57,029
This thing sticks a little bit.

439
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:58,777
You got to jiggle it...

440
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:01,193
Come on up here, pal.

441
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:03,868
Give me your keys, pal.
Give me the keys.

442
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:06,833
<i>Friends don't let friends drive, right?
Stand up here.</i>

443
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:09,997
Take a deep breath. You feel okay?

444
00:31:10,254 --> 00:31:11,630
<i>You're all right.</i>

445
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,807
You want to throw up here
or in the car?

446
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:23,720
I think, both.

447
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:36,861
<i>I don't think I should drive.</i>

448
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:38,988
<i>I don't either.</i>

449
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:40,617
Watch your head.

450
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:43,993
<i>Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.</i>

451
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:46,370
<i>Let's not forget seat belts.</i>

452
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:51,454
Who else could go for some
flapjacks right now?

453
00:31:56,718 --> 00:31:58,426
Let me ask you a question.

454
00:31:58,678 --> 00:31:59,543
Shoot.

455
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:03,048
What if there were no tomorrow?

456
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,885
<i>No tomorrow? That means there'd be
no consequences...</i>

457
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:08,687
...no hangovers.

458
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:11,394
We could do whatever we wanted!

459
00:32:12,817 --> 00:32:14,192
<i>That's true.</i>

460
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:17,522
We could do whatever we want.

461
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,654
If we wanted to hit mailboxes
we could let Ralph drive!

462
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:35,040
They want you to stop.

463
00:32:35,256 --> 00:32:36,170
Hang on!

464
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,922
<i>It's the same thing
your whole life.</i>

465
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,308
<i>" Clean up your room! Stand up
straight! Pick up your feet!</i>

466
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:49,311
Take it like a man!

467
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:51,181
Be nice to your sister!

468
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:54,514
<i>Don't mix beer and wine, ever!</i>

469
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,525
<i>Don't drive on the railroad tracks!"</i>

470
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:01,395
<i>That's one I agree with.</i>

471
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,123
<i>I don't know, Gus.</i>

472
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:16,129
Sometimes I think you just have to...

473
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:18,753
...take the big chances.

474
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:21,334
<i>This is the police! Pull over now!</i>

475
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,927
<i>We're talking in here!</i>

476
00:33:30,103 --> 00:33:32,012
I bet he swerves first.

477
00:33:46,244 --> 00:33:49,530
<i>I'm not going to live by
their rules anymore!</i>

478
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:51,372
I noticed that.

479
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:54,121
You make choices
and you live with them.

480
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,846
My knee!

481
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:14,520
Let me handle this.

482
00:34:17,108 --> 00:34:19,860
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

483
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:22,104
...two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

484
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:24,315
And some flapjacks!

485
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:26,401
Too early for flapjacks?

486
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:41,245
Yes!

487
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:44,127
Rise and shine, campers!

488
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:47,387
<i>Don't forget your booties!
It's cold out there today!</i>

489
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,014
<i>It's cold every day.</i>

490
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:52,350
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!

491
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,351
Slept like a baby.

492
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:00,601
<i>I'd love some of your coffee.</i>

493
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:02,652
- I hope...
- Flurries moving in later...

494
00:35:02,863 --> 00:35:05,021
<i>...but the blizzard's going to hit
outside of town.</i>

495
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:06,277
Mrs. Lancaster?

496
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,822
Was anybody looking for me
here this morning?

497
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:12,493
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

498
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:15,623
No, no one like that!
Will there be?

499
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:17,494
Apparently not.

500
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:22,998
<i>Will you hold my room for me?
I'm staying an extra day.</i>

501
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:30,840
Catch you tomorrow, pops.

502
00:35:36,354 --> 00:35:38,561
- Phil Connors!
- Ned?

503
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:13,262
I like to see a man of advancing years
throw caution to the wind.

504
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,764
<i>It's inspiring, in a way.</i>

505
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:19,017
My years are not advancing
as fast as you think.

506
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,520
More coffee?

507
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:22,354
Keep it coming.

508
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:23,807
Sure thing.

509
00:36:25,654 --> 00:36:28,026
Just put that anywhere, pal!

510
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:29,652
Good save!

511
00:36:31,743 --> 00:36:35,492
<i>Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?</i>

512
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,541
<i>I don't worry anymore.</i>

513
00:36:40,002 --> 00:36:42,290
What makes you special?
Everybody worries.

514
00:36:42,754 --> 00:36:45,376
<i>That's exactly what makes me
so special.</i>

515
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:47,382
<i>I don't even have to floss.</i>

516
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:58,051
What?

517
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,645
<i>"The wretch, concentred all in self</i>

518
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:06,393
<i>" Living, shall forfeit fair renown</i>

519
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,738
<i>"And doubly dying, shall go down</i>

520
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:12,949
<i>"To the vile dust from whence he sprung</i>

521
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:14,577
<i>" Unwept...</i>

522
00:37:14,786 --> 00:37:17,242
<i>"... unhonoured and unsung"</i>

523
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:19,912
Sir Walter Scott.

524
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:24,456
<i>You don't like poetry?</i>

525
00:37:25,214 --> 00:37:26,589
I love poetry!

526
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:29,918
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

527
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:32,883
<i>You think I act like this
because I'm egocentric?</i>

528
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:36,305
<i>You are egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.</i>

529
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,225
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

530
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:43,305
Thanks, Larry.

531
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,772
Would you like a doggie bag?

532
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:47,645
<i>I'll stay and finish.</i>

533
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:50,150
I thought you hated this town.

534
00:37:50,364 --> 00:37:52,238
<i>It's beginning to grow on me.</i>

535
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:54,856
Larry, quit staring.

536
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:58,073
<i>- These are excellent.
- Bon appétit,</i>

537
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:10,791
You see the groundhog
this morning?

538
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,129
I never miss it.

539
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,007
<i>What's your name?</i>

540
00:38:17,891 --> 00:38:19,967
Nancy Taylor. And you are?

541
00:38:20,185 --> 00:38:22,723
- What high school did you go to?
- What?

542
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:23,969
High school.

543
00:38:25,357 --> 00:38:27,931
Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?

544
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:31,355
Who was your 12th grade
English teacher?

545
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:32,989
Are you kidding?

546
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,446
In 12th grade,
your English teacher was...

547
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:37,568
Mrs. Walsh.

548
00:38:37,786 --> 00:38:40,823
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.

549
00:38:41,498 --> 00:38:43,538
Thanks very much.

550
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:00,218
Nancy?

551
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:03,557
Nancy Taylor!

552
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:06,269
Lincoln High School!

553
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,024
<i>I sat next to you in
Mrs. Walsh's English class!</i>

554
00:39:10,486 --> 00:39:13,771
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Phil Connors!</i>

555
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:17,523
<i>- That's amazing!
- You don't remember me?</i>

556
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,871
I asked you to the prom.

557
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:24,867
Phil Connors?

558
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:27,624
<i>I was short and I've sprouted.</i>

559
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:33,751
How are you?

560
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:35,499
Great.

561
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:37,469
You look terrific!

562
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:40,930
You look very, very terrific!

563
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:44,842
Listen, I got to go do this report.

564
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:46,307
Are you a reporter?

565
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:49,013
A weatherman with
Channel 9, Pittsburgh.

566
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:51,184
<i>I should have known! That's great!</i>

567
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:53,145
But maybe later we could...

568
00:39:53,362 --> 00:39:54,607
Yeah, whatever!

569
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:56,607
Stay right here.

570
00:39:57,032 --> 00:40:00,199
<i>Promise me?
I'll be right back. Wish me luck!</i>

571
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:02,160
Good luck!

572
00:40:20,056 --> 00:40:21,336
Oh, Phil.

573
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:23,767
Oh, Rita.

574
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:28,845
<i>Who's Rita?</i>

575
00:40:29,356 --> 00:40:30,934
How should I know?

576
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:33,771
What is this,
some kind of one-night stand?

577
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:35,985
On the contrary, Nancy...

578
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:39,489
<i>...I love you.
I've always loved you.</i>

579
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,775
This is going to seem sudden but...

580
00:40:44,163 --> 00:40:46,156
...Nancy, will you be my wife?

581
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:54,506
Rita.

582
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:57,832
- Nancy.
- Whatever.

583
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:04,513
A gust of wind.

584
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:08,060
A dog barks.

585
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:10,855
Cue the truck.

586
00:41:18,572 --> 00:41:19,771
Exit Herman.

587
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:22,365
Walk on to the bank.

588
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:26,663
Exit Felix, and stand there with a
not-so-bright look on your face.

589
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,575
All right, Doris. Come on.

590
00:41:31,252 --> 00:41:34,169
<i>Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.</i>

591
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:36,583
Felix!

592
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:38,252
How you doing, Doris?

593
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:41,041
Can I have a roll of quarters?

594
00:41:42,263 --> 00:41:46,889
Ten... nine... eight...

595
00:41:47,602 --> 00:41:48,930
...car...

596
00:41:49,145 --> 00:41:52,229
...six... five...

597
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:54,604
...quarters...

598
00:41:54,984 --> 00:41:58,567
...three... two...

599
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,533
Felix?

600
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:11,330
<i>- Did I bring out two bags or one?
- I don't know.</i>

601
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:41,149
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

602
00:42:41,406 --> 00:42:44,276
<i>It's like I said, I love this film.</i>

603
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:46,740
<i>I've seen it over 100 times.</i>

604
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:47,990
Phil!

605
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:49,491
Told you...

606
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:51,989
<i>...call me " Bronco."</i>

607
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,041
Sorry, Bronco.

608
00:42:55,294 --> 00:42:56,954
Hi, Nancy.

609
00:43:01,175 --> 00:43:03,133
My own fiancée...

610
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:05,509
<i>...doesn't remember me.</i>

611
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:11,179
<i>That'll be one adult and...</i>

612
00:43:11,436 --> 00:43:14,686
- Two adults.
- Two adults, I guess.

613
00:43:17,483 --> 00:43:22,608
<i>- Groundhog who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring,</i>

614
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:25,574
<i>The question we have
to ask ourselves today is,</i>

615
00:43:25,825 --> 00:43:27,782
<i>"Does Phil feel lucky?"</i>

616
00:43:27,994 --> 00:43:30,781
Rita, if you only
had one day to live...

617
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:32,663
...what would you do?

618
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:35,453
<i>I don't know.
What are you dying of?</i>

619
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:40,171
No, the whole world
is about to explode.

620
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:41,377
What do you do?

621
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:43,921
I want to know
where to put the camera.

622
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:46,626
What are you looking for?
A date for the weekend?

623
00:43:46,888 --> 00:43:49,723
<i>No, I'm just interested in you.</i>

624
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:52,216
What do you want?
What do you like?

625
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:54,309
What do you think about?

626
00:43:54,562 --> 00:43:56,851
What kind of men
are you interested in?

627
00:43:57,065 --> 00:43:58,892
What do you do for fun?

628
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:02,817
Are you trying to
make me look like a fool?

629
00:44:03,029 --> 00:44:07,241
<i>I'm trying to talk like normal people.
Isn't this how they talk?</i>

630
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,775
- Close.
- Okay, so talk to me.

631
00:44:10,036 --> 00:44:12,242
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

632
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:15,406
And a doughnut.

633
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,250
All right.

634
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:21,622
<i>So what do you want out of life?</i>

635
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,791
I guess I want what everybody wants.

636
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,545
Career, love, marriage, children.

637
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:31,431
Are you seeing anyone?

638
00:44:31,933 --> 00:44:36,595
<i>This is getting too personal.
I'm not ready to share this with you.</i>

639
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:40,014
How about you?
What do you want?

640
00:44:41,192 --> 00:44:44,478
What I really want
is someone like you.

641
00:44:44,737 --> 00:44:46,018
Oh, please!

642
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:48,439
Why not? What are you looking for?

643
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,028
<i>Who's your perfect guy?</i>

644
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:55,409
<i>First of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.</i>

645
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,125
<i>That's me!</i>

646
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:01,710
<i>He's intelligent,
supportive, funny...</i>

647
00:45:01,963 --> 00:45:04,169
Intelligent, supportive, funny.

648
00:45:04,424 --> 00:45:07,757
Me, me, me.

649
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:10,798
<i>He's romantic and courageous.</i>

650
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:12,301
Me also.

651
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:16,473
<i>He's got a good body but doesn't
have to look in the mirror often.</i>

652
00:45:17,145 --> 00:45:21,973
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

653
00:45:24,486 --> 00:45:27,985
<i>He's kind, sensitive and gentle.</i>

654
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:30,358
<i>He's not afraid to cry.</i>

655
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:33,190
<i>This is a man
we're talking about, right?</i>

656
00:45:33,453 --> 00:45:38,411
<i>He likes animals, children,
and he'll change poopy diapers.</i>

657
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:41,039
<i>Does he have to use the word " poopy"?</i>

658
00:45:42,587 --> 00:45:46,039
He plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

659
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,052
I am really close on this one.

660
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:53,597
Really, really close.

661
00:45:58,061 --> 00:45:59,639
<i>It's Phil Connors!</i>

662
00:45:59,854 --> 00:46:01,135
Hello.

663
00:46:01,356 --> 00:46:03,183
Thanks for watching.

664
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:19,287
What are the chances
of getting out today?

665
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:21,783
<i>Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.</i>

666
00:46:22,043 --> 00:46:23,454
<i>Wouldn't you know it?</i>

667
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:25,503
Can I buy you a drink?

668
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:30,802
Jim Beam, ice, water.

669
00:46:31,636 --> 00:46:32,751
For you, miss?

670
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:36,555
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

671
00:46:41,855 --> 00:46:44,097
What are the chances
of getting out today?

672
00:46:44,357 --> 00:46:46,765
<i>Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.</i>

673
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:48,651
<i>Wouldn't you know it?</i>

674
00:46:48,862 --> 00:46:50,736
Can I buy you a drink?

675
00:46:53,617 --> 00:46:56,321
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

676
00:46:56,536 --> 00:46:57,402
For you, miss?

677
00:46:57,788 --> 00:46:59,282
The same.

678
00:47:00,123 --> 00:47:01,783
<i>That's my favourite drink.</i>

679
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,785
Mine too!

680
00:47:04,044 --> 00:47:05,586
It makes me think of Rome.

681
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:09,087
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

682
00:47:10,842 --> 00:47:12,835
What should we drink to?

683
00:47:14,096 --> 00:47:16,005
To the groundhog!

684
00:47:16,264 --> 00:47:18,886
I always drink to world peace.

685
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:29,727
Can I buy you a drink?

686
00:47:32,656 --> 00:47:35,692
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

687
00:47:36,368 --> 00:47:38,076
For you, miss?

688
00:47:38,328 --> 00:47:39,988
The same.

689
00:47:40,622 --> 00:47:42,081
<i>That's my favourite drink.</i>

690
00:47:42,332 --> 00:47:43,910
Mine too!

691
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:47,368
It makes me think of Rome.

692
00:47:47,629 --> 00:47:51,413
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

693
00:47:52,509 --> 00:47:54,336
What should we drink to?

694
00:47:56,388 --> 00:47:59,555
<i>I'd like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.</i>

695
00:48:01,518 --> 00:48:03,309
To world peace.

696
00:48:13,363 --> 00:48:16,697
<i>- This is wonderful!
- See? Didn't I tell you?</i>

697
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:18,948
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

698
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:21,568
I spent a lot of time here.

699
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,870
Small-town people are
more real, down-to-earth.

700
00:48:24,124 --> 00:48:26,496
<i>- That's how I feel!
- Really?</i>

701
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,830
<i>- Some white chocolate?
- Yuck, don't make me sick.</i>

702
00:48:30,088 --> 00:48:31,251
No white chocolate.

703
00:48:31,465 --> 00:48:34,382
There is something
so familiar about this.

704
00:48:34,635 --> 00:48:36,711
Do you ever have déjà vu?

705
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,177
<i>Didn't you just ask me that?</i>

706
00:48:43,143 --> 00:48:46,726
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

707
00:48:46,939 --> 00:48:50,105
I wish we could all live
in the mountains.

708
00:48:50,317 --> 00:48:52,855
<i>That's where I see myself
in five years.</i>

709
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:54,025
How about you?

710
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:57,114
I agree. I just like
to go with the flow.

711
00:48:57,324 --> 00:48:59,400
See where it leads me.

712
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,487
<i>Well, it's led you here.</i>

713
00:49:03,247 --> 00:49:06,912
<i>It's about a million miles
from where I started in college.</i>

714
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:10,667
<i>You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?</i>

715
00:49:11,755 --> 00:49:15,883
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

716
00:49:16,176 --> 00:49:17,754
What a waste of time!

717
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,924
<i>I mean, for someone else
that'd be a total waste.</i>

718
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:23,221
So bold of you to choose that.

719
00:49:23,475 --> 00:49:27,140
<i>It's incredible.
You must be a very strong person.</i>

720
00:49:28,897 --> 00:49:32,397
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

721
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:37,194
I wish we could all
live in the mountains.

722
00:49:37,448 --> 00:49:39,689
<i>That's where I see myself
in five years.</i>

723
00:49:39,908 --> 00:49:40,904
How about you?

724
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,074
I agree. I like to go
with the flow, see what happens.

725
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:47,619
<i>Well, it's gotten you here.</i>

726
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:51,370
<i>It's a million miles
from where I started in college.</i>

727
00:49:51,628 --> 00:49:55,080
<i>You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism or anything like that?</i>

728
00:49:56,216 --> 00:50:00,297
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

729
00:50:17,237 --> 00:50:18,518
You speak French!

730
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:27,039
<i>I haven't done this since I was a kid.</i>

731
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,081
<i>Me neither. It's fun!</i>

732
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:30,407
Clean fun.

733
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:36,795
I hope one day I can do this
with my own children.

734
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:42,461
<i>Where'd you get that?</i>

735
00:50:42,721 --> 00:50:45,343
Well, I went over
to the snowman shop.

736
00:50:47,184 --> 00:50:48,726
Hey, an assassin!

737
00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:50,764
<i>I'll protect you!</i>

738
00:50:51,272 --> 00:50:54,023
I shall die for you.
You shall not take her!

739
00:50:54,233 --> 00:50:55,513
Find cover!

740
00:50:57,862 --> 00:51:00,187
<i>I'm getting some good ones.</i>

741
00:51:00,406 --> 00:51:03,276
<i>That's a boy! Good try.</i>

742
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:05,152
Help me!

743
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:02,296
What?

744
00:52:02,551 --> 00:52:06,596
<i>I'm just amazed,
and I'm not easily amazed.</i>

745
00:52:06,847 --> 00:52:08,258
About what?

746
00:52:08,516 --> 00:52:11,267
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation...

747
00:52:11,477 --> 00:52:13,553
...and end up
so completely different.

748
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:18,147
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

749
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:20,767
I like it very much.

750
00:52:21,028 --> 00:52:24,528
<i>It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.</i>

751
00:52:24,782 --> 00:52:26,027
Well, you can.

752
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:29,243
It just takes an awful lot of work.

753
00:52:29,495 --> 00:52:31,701
Come in.
I want to show you something.

754
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:34,203
<i>- I don't think I should.
- I agree.</i>

755
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:38,788
<i>That's why I want to show you one thing,
then kick you right out.</i>

756
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:49,213
<i>It's just lovely.</i>

757
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,360
Would you like to sit
and stare at the fake fire?

758
00:53:07,033 --> 00:53:09,239
<i>It's a really wonderful room.</i>

759
00:53:09,493 --> 00:53:11,320
It is now.

760
00:53:18,252 --> 00:53:20,708
<i>I don't think we should do this.</i>

761
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:22,588
<i>I don't either.</i>

762
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:28,006
On second thought,
I think we should.

763
00:53:28,846 --> 00:53:32,013
<i>It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.</i>

764
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,517
<i>Well, it's a little fast for me.</i>

765
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,181
Me too.

766
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,889
Maybe I should go.

767
00:53:40,108 --> 00:53:42,017
Where would you go?

768
00:53:42,276 --> 00:53:43,652
Why?

769
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:46,150
<i>We've got a perfect fire.</i>

770
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:49,484
<i>I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire...</i>

771
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:52,529
I will read to you.

772
00:53:53,287 --> 00:53:57,415
<i>I've got some ice cream on
the windowsill. Hold on a minute.</i>

773
00:54:03,047 --> 00:54:04,078
Rocky road.

774
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,882
I love rocky road.

775
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:08,043
Yeah, I thought so.

776
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:10,052
You have to stay.

777
00:54:10,304 --> 00:54:14,088
<i>No, really, I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.</i>

778
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:18,099
<i>No, tonight.
It's got to be tonight.</i>

779
00:54:18,312 --> 00:54:21,183
No, Phil, really.

780
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:25,358
Just stay for a while and
if you like it, stay longer.

781
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:27,693
And if you like that, stay longer.

782
00:54:27,905 --> 00:54:29,779
<i>Let's not spoil it, okay?</i>

783
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,440
<i>I don't want to spoil it either.</i>

784
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,578
<i>You know I can't stay with you.</i>

785
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:38,914
Why not? I love you.

786
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,083
You love me?

787
00:54:43,338 --> 00:54:47,466
<i>- You don't even know me.
- I know you.</i>

788
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:51,964
<i>Oh, no. I can't believe
I fell for this!</i>

789
00:54:52,221 --> 00:54:54,594
This whole day has been
one long setup.

790
00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:55,798
<i>No, it hasn't.</i>

791
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,810
And I hate fudge. Yuck!

792
00:54:59,103 --> 00:55:01,143
No white chocolate, no fudge.

793
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:05,147
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

794
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,563
Did you call my friends
and ask them what I like?

795
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:12,321
- Is this what love is for you?
- This is real. This is love.

796
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:13,992
Stop saying that!

797
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:16,161
You must be crazy.

798
00:55:16,412 --> 00:55:20,113
<i>I could never love you because
you'll never love anyone but yourself.</i>

799
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:24,249
<i>I don't even like myself.
Give me another chance.</i>

800
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,543
<i>That's for making me
care about you.</i>

801
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:37,970
<i>I haven't done this
since I was a kid.</i>

802
00:55:38,226 --> 00:55:39,222
<i>It's fun!</i>

803
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:43,765
<i>And good, clean fun too.
That's what's missing in the world.</i>

804
00:55:44,023 --> 00:55:46,728
<i>I can't wait to do this
with my own children.</i>

805
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,485
I want lots of kids!

806
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:52,568
I want to adopt, I want my own kids,
I want to have foster kids.

807
00:55:52,824 --> 00:55:55,066
I got this at Snowman City.

808
00:55:55,326 --> 00:55:58,162
Hey! Some kid just
threw a snowball at us.

809
00:55:58,413 --> 00:56:01,248
<i>Come here! Let's have some fun!</i>

810
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,247
I wish these were my own kids.

811
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:11,503
Are any of you up for adoption?

812
00:56:12,218 --> 00:56:14,626
<i>Here's a humdinger over here!</i>

813
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:16,927
<i>Wasn't that great?</i>

814
00:56:25,357 --> 00:56:26,981
Stop it!

815
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:13,771
Phil! Over here!

816
00:57:16,157 --> 00:57:18,779
<i>Where have you been?
You're missing the fun.</i>

817
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,909
Phil, you look terrible.

818
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,071
What happened? Rough night?

819
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:43,969
Okay, campers.

820
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:46,221
Rise and shine.

821
00:57:48,148 --> 00:57:51,813
<i>Don't forget your booties,
because it's cold out there.</i>

822
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:55,143
<i>It's cold out there every day.</i>

823
00:57:55,864 --> 00:57:59,696
<i>This country's largest lake,
Chapala, is located near Guadalajara,</i>

824
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:01,948
What is Mexico?

825
00:58:02,162 --> 00:58:03,193
<i>What is Mexico?</i>

826
00:58:03,538 --> 00:58:05,365
<i>- Correct,
- Lakes and Rivers, 400,</i>

827
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:08,293
<i>Seneca is the largest
of these lakes,</i>

828
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,455
What are the Finger Lakes?

829
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,624
<i>- What are the Finger Lakes?
- Correct,</i>

830
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:18,004
<i>- This lake in Bolivia...
- What is Titicaca?</i>

831
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,005
<i>- What is Titicaca?
- Correct,</i>

832
00:58:20,222 --> 00:58:21,171
For 1,000.

833
00:58:21,389 --> 00:58:23,299
<i>- Milky-coloured...
- The Rhone.</i>

834
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:25,183
<i>,,, when entering Lake Geneva,,,</i>

835
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,973
<i>,,, this river is
clear blue upon exiting,</i>

836
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:29,137
<i>- Jim?
- The Rhone,</i>

837
00:58:29,398 --> 00:58:30,726
<i>Good for $1, 000,</i>

838
00:58:30,982 --> 00:58:33,390
<i>You're $500 off the lead right now,</i>

839
00:58:36,196 --> 00:58:37,856
This is pitiful.

840
00:58:38,198 --> 00:58:39,609
A thousand people...

841
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:42,867
...freezing their butts off,
waiting to worship a rat.

842
00:58:43,078 --> 00:58:44,656
What a hype.

843
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:49,375
They used to pull the hog out,
and they used to eat it.

844
00:58:49,584 --> 00:58:52,704
<i>You're hypocrites! All of you!</i>

845
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:56,549
You got a problem, Larry?

846
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:58,840
Untie your tongue.

847
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:01,424
Come here and talk.
Am I upsetting you...

848
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:02,836
...princess?

849
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:04,848
You want a prediction
about the weather?

850
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,769
<i>You're asking the wrong Phil.</i>

851
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,689
<i>I'll give you a winter prediction.</i>

852
00:59:10,939 --> 00:59:12,979
<i>It's going to be cold.</i>

853
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:15,440
<i>It's going to be gray.</i>

854
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:20,445
<i>And it's going to last you
for the rest of your life.</i>

855
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:59,024
Once again the eyes of the nation
have turned here...

856
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,780
...to this tiny village
in Western Pennsylvania.

857
01:00:02,991 --> 01:00:05,909
There is no way that this winter...

858
01:00:06,161 --> 01:00:09,032
...is ever going to end...

859
01:00:09,248 --> 01:00:13,197
...as long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

860
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,334
<i>I don't see any other way out.</i>

861
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,003
<i>He's got to be stopped.</i>

862
01:00:19,508 --> 01:00:20,883
And I have to stop it.

863
01:00:23,428 --> 01:00:24,258
Real good, Phil.

864
01:00:24,513 --> 01:00:25,758
Real good.

865
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:28,927
<i>He's out of his gourd.</i>

866
01:00:33,605 --> 01:00:36,974
<i>I'm worried. There's something
really wrong with Phil.</i>

867
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:39,903
<i>There's a lot of things
wrong with Phil.</i>

868
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,317
Hi, Phil.

869
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,863
<i>I've come to the end of me.</i>

870
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:48,241
<i>There's no way out now.</i>

871
01:00:49,705 --> 01:00:53,038
Just remember, we had
a beautiful day together once.

872
01:00:56,462 --> 01:00:57,872
All right, little fellow.

873
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:01,499
Good job. He just smiled at me!
Did you see that?

874
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:03,253
I believe he did.

875
01:01:04,178 --> 01:01:07,013
Okay, little fellow.
There you go.

876
01:01:09,016 --> 01:01:11,388
Hi, there. Something I can
do you for?

877
01:01:13,979 --> 01:01:15,888
Hey! What are you doing?

878
01:01:20,653 --> 01:01:22,692
Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

879
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:24,400
We are going after him!

880
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,487
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

881
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:35,784
I could think of reasons.

882
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:36,950
Pervert.

883
01:02:02,987 --> 01:02:04,778
He must have just snapped!

884
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:06,317
This ought to be good.

885
01:02:08,701 --> 01:02:09,946
What is he doing?

886
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,703
What can he be thinking?

887
01:02:12,371 --> 01:02:13,949
Not bad for a quadruped.

888
01:02:14,206 --> 01:02:18,121
Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.
Side of your eye.

889
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:25,669
<i>That's it.</i>

890
01:02:25,926 --> 01:02:28,963
<i>Hey, they're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.</i>

891
01:02:37,188 --> 01:02:38,350
<i>Don't drive angry.</i>

892
01:02:38,564 --> 01:02:39,762
<i>Don't drive angry.</i>

893
01:02:59,794 --> 01:03:02,664
<i>There's no way out
except the way we came in!</i>

894
01:03:02,922 --> 01:03:04,380
We got him now!

895
01:03:23,693 --> 01:03:24,891
What is he doing?

896
01:03:25,152 --> 01:03:26,148
<i>I don't know.</i>

897
01:03:30,491 --> 01:03:33,278
<i>If you got to shoot,
don't hit the groundhog.</i>

898
01:03:38,082 --> 01:03:39,825
<i>Mustn't keep them waiting.</i>

899
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,499
<i>It's showtime.</i>

900
01:03:50,886 --> 01:03:52,167
On me in three...

901
01:03:54,307 --> 01:03:55,137
...two...

902
01:03:57,059 --> 01:03:58,008
...one.

903
01:04:11,824 --> 01:04:12,855
Phil!

904
01:04:15,202 --> 01:04:16,578
He might be okay.

905
01:04:21,209 --> 01:04:23,746
Well, no. Probably not now.

906
01:04:39,393 --> 01:04:40,638
Nuts.

907
01:04:48,569 --> 01:04:51,487
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

908
01:04:52,532 --> 01:04:54,192
Would you like...

909
01:04:54,826 --> 01:04:56,236
...some toast?

910
01:05:14,595 --> 01:05:16,671
Oh, my God!

911
01:05:49,255 --> 01:05:50,630
<i>That's him.</i>

912
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:57,217
He was a really, really great guy.

913
01:05:57,472 --> 01:05:59,180
I really, really liked him...

914
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:00,630
...a lot.

915
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:09,975
<i>I'm sorry?
What was that again?</i>

916
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:13,153
<i>- I'm a god.
- You're God?</i>

917
01:06:13,363 --> 01:06:16,613
<i>I'm a god. I'm not the god,
I don't think.</i>

918
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,323
Because you survived a car wreck?

919
01:06:19,535 --> 01:06:20,698
You folks ready to order?

920
01:06:20,954 --> 01:06:24,157
<i>I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up.</i>

921
01:06:24,582 --> 01:06:27,156
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...

922
01:06:27,377 --> 01:06:30,710
...frozen, hung, electrocuted
and burned.

923
01:06:30,922 --> 01:06:32,250
Oh, really.

924
01:06:32,507 --> 01:06:36,718
Every morning I wake up without a
scratch, not a dent in the fender.

925
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:38,508
I am an immortal.

926
01:06:38,721 --> 01:06:41,343
Special today is blueberry waffles.

927
01:06:41,558 --> 01:06:43,384
Why are you telling me this?

928
01:06:43,685 --> 01:06:45,808
Because I want you to believe in me.

929
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,349
You are not a god.

930
01:06:47,564 --> 01:06:50,979
<i>Take my word. It's 12 years
of Catholic school talking.</i>

931
01:06:51,526 --> 01:06:53,483
<i>I can come back if you're not ready.</i>

932
01:06:53,695 --> 01:06:55,687
<i>How do you know I'm not a god?</i>

933
01:06:55,905 --> 01:06:57,150
Please.

934
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,732
<i>- How do you know?
- It's not possible.</i>

935
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:01,694
<i>I'll come back.</i>

936
01:07:02,036 --> 01:07:03,281
Doris.

937
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:09,281
This is Doris.
Her brother-in-law owns this diner.

938
01:07:09,544 --> 01:07:13,209
<i>She's worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris...</i>

939
01:07:13,423 --> 01:07:14,621
...before she dies.

940
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:15,790
Boy, would I!

941
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:18,678
- What are you doing?
- Debbie and her fiancé.

942
01:07:18,928 --> 01:07:20,173
Do I know you?

943
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:23,259
<i>They're supposed to get married.
She's having second thoughts.</i>

944
01:07:23,516 --> 01:07:24,679
What?

945
01:07:24,934 --> 01:07:26,049
Lovely ring.

946
01:07:26,311 --> 01:07:31,138
<i>Bill's been a waiter three years,
since he left Penn State to work.</i>

947
01:07:31,399 --> 01:07:34,484
<i>He likes the town,
paints toy soldiers, and he's gay.</i>

948
01:07:34,694 --> 01:07:35,725
I am.

949
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:39,114
<i>Gus hates it here,
wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.</i>

950
01:07:39,365 --> 01:07:41,903
<i>I could've retired
on half pay after 20 years.</i>

951
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,987
Excuse me. Is this a trick?

952
01:07:44,245 --> 01:07:48,077
<i>Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe he's not omnipotent...</i>

953
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:50,242
...he just knows everything.

954
01:07:50,502 --> 01:07:51,830
<i>- Who's that?
- Tom.</i>

955
01:07:52,087 --> 01:07:54,079
He worked in the coal mine
till it closed.

956
01:07:54,297 --> 01:07:55,460
- And her?
- Alice.

957
01:07:55,715 --> 01:07:58,253
Came from Ireland when she
was a baby. Lived in Erie.

958
01:07:58,510 --> 01:07:59,340
<i>He's right.</i>

959
01:07:59,552 --> 01:08:00,963
- And her?
- Nancy.

960
01:08:01,221 --> 01:08:05,171
Works in a shop, makes noises like
a chipmunk when she gets excited.

961
01:08:05,433 --> 01:08:07,141
<i>- It's true.
- How do you know this?</i>

962
01:08:07,394 --> 01:08:09,102
I told you, I know everything.

963
01:08:09,354 --> 01:08:12,224
In five seconds, a waiter
will drop a tray.

964
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,192
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.

965
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:19,936
<i>- Okay?
- Okay, that's enough.</i>

966
01:08:20,991 --> 01:08:23,197
What about me?
Do you know me too?

967
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:27,663
I know all about you. You hope
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

968
01:08:27,872 --> 01:08:30,280
Well, everyone knows that.

969
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:33,240
You like boats but not the ocean.

970
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:37,039
You go to a lake in the summer
with your family.

971
01:08:37,299 --> 01:08:41,213
<i>There's a dock and a boathouse
with boards missing from the roof...</i>

972
01:08:41,928 --> 01:08:44,846
...and a place you used to
crawl underneath to be alone.

973
01:08:45,473 --> 01:08:48,724
<i>You're a sucker for
French poetry and rhinestones.</i>

974
01:08:49,436 --> 01:08:50,847
<i>You're very generous.</i>

975
01:08:51,104 --> 01:08:53,595
<i>You're kind to strangers
and children.</i>

976
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:56,984
When you stand in the snow
you look like an angel.

977
01:08:57,444 --> 01:08:58,986
How are you doing this?

978
01:09:00,071 --> 01:09:03,025
I told you. I wake up every day.

979
01:09:03,283 --> 01:09:04,943
Right here.

980
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,576
<i>Right in Punxsutawney.
And it's always February 2nd.</i>

981
01:09:09,581 --> 01:09:12,072
<i>And there's nothing
I can do about it.</i>

982
01:09:12,792 --> 01:09:15,877
<i>If you still can't believe me, listen:</i>

983
01:09:16,129 --> 01:09:18,122
In 10 seconds...

984
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:22,083
...Larry is going to come
and take you away from me.

985
01:09:22,344 --> 01:09:24,171
<i>But you can't let him.</i>

986
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,216
<i>Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.</i>

987
01:09:33,313 --> 01:09:37,311
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

988
01:09:37,943 --> 01:09:39,188
<i>What's that?</i>

989
01:09:40,112 --> 01:09:42,519
<i>"... to stay ahead of the weather."</i>

990
01:09:48,036 --> 01:09:52,116
Maybe it really is happening.
How else could you know so much?

991
01:09:52,332 --> 01:09:54,823
<i>There is no way.
I'm not that smart.</i>

992
01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:58,203
Maybe I should
spend the day with you...

993
01:09:58,463 --> 01:10:01,915
...as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

994
01:10:02,175 --> 01:10:04,631
This sounds like a science project.

995
01:10:05,762 --> 01:10:06,960
Concentrate.

996
01:10:07,222 --> 01:10:09,013
You got to want it.

997
01:10:09,474 --> 01:10:11,550
You got to want it, Rita.

998
01:10:12,019 --> 01:10:15,886
<i>Come on. It's more
in the wrist than the fingers.</i>

999
01:10:24,197 --> 01:10:26,024
Be the hat. Come on, go.

1000
01:10:26,283 --> 01:10:29,237
<i>- It'd take me a year to get good.
- Six months.</i>

1001
01:10:29,494 --> 01:10:32,745
<i>Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.</i>

1002
01:10:33,248 --> 01:10:36,866
- Is this what you do with eternity?
- Now you know.

1003
01:10:38,295 --> 01:10:40,334
<i>That's not the worst part.</i>

1004
01:10:40,589 --> 01:10:42,000
<i>What's the worst part?</i>

1005
01:10:42,257 --> 01:10:44,250
The worst part is that...

1006
01:10:44,468 --> 01:10:47,006
<i>...tomorrow you'll have
forgotten all about this...</i>

1007
01:10:47,262 --> 01:10:49,469
<i>...and you'll treat me
like a jerk again.</i>

1008
01:10:50,599 --> 01:10:52,058
I am a jerk.

1009
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:54,094
<i>No, you're not.</i>

1010
01:10:54,478 --> 01:10:58,974
<i>It doesn't make any difference.
I've killed myself so many times...</i>

1011
01:10:59,233 --> 01:11:00,940
<i>...I don't even exist anymore.</i>

1012
01:11:01,526 --> 01:11:04,278
Sometimes I wish I had
a thousand lifetimes.

1013
01:11:04,863 --> 01:11:07,864
<i>I don't know.
Maybe it's not a curse.</i>

1014
01:11:08,116 --> 01:11:10,738
It just depends
on how you look at it.

1015
01:11:12,287 --> 01:11:14,494
<i>Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!</i>

1016
01:11:17,793 --> 01:11:20,960
<i>I want you to know it's been
a really nice day for me.</i>

1017
01:11:21,213 --> 01:11:22,078
Me too.

1018
01:11:22,297 --> 01:11:23,495
And maybe...

1019
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:27,422
<i>...if it's not too boring,
we can do it again sometime.</i>

1020
01:11:27,678 --> 01:11:29,088
I hope so.

1021
01:11:41,275 --> 01:11:43,066
<i>You're still here?</i>

1022
01:11:45,446 --> 01:11:48,281
I thought you were supposed
to disappear. Or I was.

1023
01:11:48,532 --> 01:11:50,192
Not until 6.

1024
01:11:51,076 --> 01:11:52,487
You rat!

1025
01:11:52,744 --> 01:11:54,571
I never said midnight.

1026
01:11:54,913 --> 01:11:57,369
You knew I was waiting for midnight.

1027
01:11:58,167 --> 01:11:59,577
Are you going to leave?

1028
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,495
Good.

1029
01:12:15,184 --> 01:12:16,844
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1030
01:12:18,354 --> 01:12:20,595
<i>It's all right.
You can fall asleep.</i>

1031
01:12:21,607 --> 01:12:23,932
<i>I promise I won't touch you.</i>

1032
01:12:24,651 --> 01:12:25,896
Much.

1033
01:12:27,237 --> 01:12:29,989
<i>It's all right. I'm not tired.</i>

1034
01:12:30,824 --> 01:12:32,484
What were you saying?

1035
01:12:33,911 --> 01:12:37,196
I think the last thing
that you heard was...

1036
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:40,125
...only God could make a tree.

1037
01:12:40,376 --> 01:12:41,455
Really?

1038
01:13:19,623 --> 01:13:21,912
What I wanted to say was...

1039
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:25,792
...I think you are the kindest...

1040
01:13:26,046 --> 01:13:28,584
...sweetest, prettiest person...

1041
01:13:29,091 --> 01:13:31,084
<i>...I've ever met in my life.</i>

1042
01:13:32,636 --> 01:13:34,843
<i>I've never seen anyone...</i>

1043
01:13:35,472 --> 01:13:37,964
<i>...that's nicer to people
than you are.</i>

1044
01:13:50,946 --> 01:13:52,986
And the first time I saw you...

1045
01:13:54,074 --> 01:13:56,316
...something happened to me.

1046
01:13:57,578 --> 01:13:59,701
I never told you...

1047
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:05,491
...but I knew I wanted
to hold you...

1048
01:14:05,711 --> 01:14:07,585
...as hard as I could.

1049
01:14:20,559 --> 01:14:23,015
<i>I don't deserve someone like you.</i>

1050
01:14:26,857 --> 01:14:28,649
But if I ever could...

1051
01:14:30,111 --> 01:14:32,187
...I swear I would love you...

1052
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:34,694
...for the rest of my life.

1053
01:14:39,286 --> 01:14:41,160
Did you say something?

1054
01:14:46,877 --> 01:14:48,455
Good night, Rita.

1055
01:14:49,672 --> 01:14:51,249
Good night, Phil.

1056
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:19,532
<i>Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties,</i>

1057
01:15:19,744 --> 01:15:22,780
<i>- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day,</i>

1058
01:15:22,997 --> 01:15:25,286
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

1059
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:03,157
<i>Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.</i>

1060
01:16:04,038 --> 01:16:05,201
Thanks, Phil.

1061
01:16:05,414 --> 01:16:06,244
Larry?

1062
01:16:06,499 --> 01:16:08,575
Skim milk, two sugar.

1063
01:16:08,835 --> 01:16:10,163
Thanks, Phil.

1064
01:16:10,378 --> 01:16:11,540
Pastry?

1065
01:16:11,796 --> 01:16:12,958
<i>We're setting up.</i>

1066
01:16:13,172 --> 01:16:14,964
Pastry, Larry?
Take your pick.

1067
01:16:16,217 --> 01:16:18,256
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

1068
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:21,928
I talked with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.

1069
01:16:22,181 --> 01:16:24,968
<i>He said if we set up here
we'll get a better shot.</i>

1070
01:16:25,435 --> 01:16:27,676
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

1071
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,219
Larry?

1072
01:16:30,523 --> 01:16:32,432
<i>Yeah. Let's go for it.</i>

1073
01:16:32,692 --> 01:16:33,723
Good work, Phil.

1074
01:16:34,402 --> 01:16:37,735
<i>Maybe we'll get lucky.
Let me give you a hand.</i>

1075
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:42,116
<i>No, no. You got your coffee.
I'll get it.</i>

1076
01:16:43,411 --> 01:16:45,285
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

1077
01:17:20,073 --> 01:17:21,899
<i>I'd like a piano lesson.</i>

1078
01:17:22,241 --> 01:17:26,191
<i>I'm with a student. But if you
want to come back tomorrow...</i>

1079
01:17:26,412 --> 01:17:29,662
I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1,000.

1080
01:17:32,418 --> 01:17:33,332
Come on in.

1081
01:17:52,897 --> 01:17:54,937
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

1082
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:57,189
<i>Buon giorno, signore!</i>

1083
01:17:58,194 --> 01:18:00,650
<i>Think it'll be an early spring?</i>

1084
01:18:00,905 --> 01:18:03,277
<i>"Winter, slumbering in the open air</i>

1085
01:18:03,533 --> 01:18:05,157
Wears on his smiling face...

1086
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,616
<i>...a dream of spring"</i>

1087
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,902
Ciao!

1088
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:11,404
Ciao!

1089
01:18:49,537 --> 01:18:50,782
How does she look?

1090
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:52,160
Great.

1091
01:18:52,665 --> 01:18:53,579
Thank you.

1092
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:57,243
Did you know he could ice sculpt?

1093
01:19:11,309 --> 01:19:14,512
Not bad. You say
this is your first lesson?

1094
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,730
Yes, but my father
was a piano mover, so...

1095
01:19:24,656 --> 01:19:29,152
- Phil Connors, I thought it was you.
- Ned Ryerson.

1096
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:33,408
I have missed you so much.

1097
01:19:37,794 --> 01:19:41,329
<i>I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?</i>

1098
01:19:44,759 --> 01:19:46,669
I got to get going.

1099
01:19:47,554 --> 01:19:49,593
<i>It's good to see you, Phil.</i>

1100
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:09,158
Hello, father.

1101
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,618
<i>Let's get you someplace warm.</i>

1102
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:14,830
Remember me?

1103
01:20:21,671 --> 01:20:23,379
You brought the old man in?

1104
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:24,621
How is he?

1105
01:20:25,342 --> 01:20:27,334
He just passed away.

1106
01:20:29,095 --> 01:20:32,132
- What did he die of?
- He was just old.

1107
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:34,217
It was just his time.

1108
01:20:36,978 --> 01:20:39,979
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!

1109
01:20:40,357 --> 01:20:41,981
<i>You can't come in here.</i>

1110
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:44,855
Sir, this is a restricted area.

1111
01:20:54,037 --> 01:20:55,697
<i>Where's the chart?</i>

1112
01:20:56,206 --> 01:20:58,531
Sometimes people just die.

1113
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:00,918
Not today.

1114
01:21:13,306 --> 01:21:15,513
Gets hard down there at the bottom.

1115
01:21:18,437 --> 01:21:19,635
Here you go.

1116
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,094
Thank you.

1117
01:21:25,527 --> 01:21:26,606
Come on, dad.

1118
01:21:26,862 --> 01:21:28,237
Come on, pop.

1119
01:21:30,198 --> 01:21:31,990
Come on. Come on, breathe.

1120
01:21:32,242 --> 01:21:34,911
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!

1121
01:22:00,646 --> 01:22:03,315
When Chekhov saw the long winter...

1122
01:22:03,774 --> 01:22:07,143
...he saw a winter bleak
and dark and bereft of hope.

1123
01:22:07,402 --> 01:22:12,064
Yet we know winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

1124
01:22:12,324 --> 01:22:15,989
But standing here among
the people of Punxsutawney...

1125
01:22:16,245 --> 01:22:19,032
...and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

1126
01:22:20,123 --> 01:22:22,412
<i>...I couldn't imagine a better fate...</i>

1127
01:22:22,626 --> 01:22:25,580
...than a long and lustrous winter.

1128
01:22:25,837 --> 01:22:28,625
<i>From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors.</i>

1129
01:22:28,882 --> 01:22:30,163
So long.

1130
01:22:32,052 --> 01:22:33,760
Nice speech. Very nice.

1131
01:22:34,012 --> 01:22:35,175
Thank you.

1132
01:22:36,515 --> 01:22:39,765
- How was that for you two?
- My man, you touched me.

1133
01:22:40,018 --> 01:22:41,678
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.

1134
01:22:43,063 --> 01:22:43,976
I got to go.

1135
01:22:45,566 --> 01:22:49,610
<i>That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.</i>

1136
01:22:49,862 --> 01:22:51,522
I surprise myself sometimes.

1137
01:22:51,738 --> 01:22:53,731
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1138
01:22:53,949 --> 01:22:57,899
<i>I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands.</i>

1139
01:23:01,665 --> 01:23:03,574
Errands? What errands?

1140
01:23:03,834 --> 01:23:06,040
I thought we were going back.

1141
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:26,522
What do you say?
What do you say?

1142
01:23:26,732 --> 01:23:29,602
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

1143
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:31,943
<i>I'll see you tomorrow...</i>

1144
01:23:32,196 --> 01:23:33,275
...maybe.

1145
01:23:40,996 --> 01:23:43,321
You totaled it.

1146
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:47,668
<i>- It's only a flat tire.
- What are we going to do?</i>

1147
01:23:49,046 --> 01:23:52,462
<i>- It's an earthquake!
- It's not an earthquake.</i>

1148
01:23:52,675 --> 01:23:53,670
What is it?

1149
01:23:57,262 --> 01:23:59,338
Thank you, young man.

1150
01:24:00,474 --> 01:24:02,846
<i>It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.</i>

1151
01:24:03,102 --> 01:24:05,723
<i>Just be comfortable.
It'll be a minute.</i>

1152
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:07,178
Who is that?

1153
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:10,191
He must be from the motor club.

1154
01:24:11,443 --> 01:24:14,113
<i>He's having a heart attack!
Do something!</i>

1155
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:18,443
Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer,
doctor, anything!

1156
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:27,250
I think that did it.

1157
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:34,000
<i>If you're going to eat steak,
get sharper teeth.</i>

1158
01:24:34,258 --> 01:24:36,583
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

1159
01:24:37,177 --> 01:24:38,506
Who was that?

1160
01:24:38,721 --> 01:24:41,425
<i>- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?</i>

1161
01:24:41,682 --> 01:24:42,547
Eat, eat!

1162
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:48,521
<i>People don't understand,,,</i>

1163
01:24:48,731 --> 01:24:51,518
<i>...what's involved.
This is an art form.</i>

1164
01:24:51,775 --> 01:24:54,231
I think most people just think...

1165
01:24:54,486 --> 01:24:57,653
...that I hold a camera
and point it at stuff.

1166
01:24:57,907 --> 01:25:00,195
<i>There's a lot more to it than that.</i>

1167
01:25:02,244 --> 01:25:05,744
Would you be interested in seeing
the inside of a van?

1168
01:25:05,956 --> 01:25:09,242
You know, I really have to
get back to the party.

1169
01:25:09,502 --> 01:25:11,210
<i>Great idea.
I'll go with you.</i>

1170
01:25:11,462 --> 01:25:13,704
Let me just drop a tip here.

1171
01:25:19,762 --> 01:25:21,256
Hi! How are you?

1172
01:25:21,514 --> 01:25:23,305
Rita, this is Nancy.

1173
01:25:24,433 --> 01:25:26,675
We were going to the party.
You going?

1174
01:25:26,894 --> 01:25:29,515
Sounds like fun.
Maybe we should call Phil.

1175
01:25:30,606 --> 01:25:32,682
<i>I think he's already in there.</i>

1176
01:27:29,392 --> 01:27:30,637
<i>Isn't he good?</i>

1177
01:27:30,893 --> 01:27:32,008
<i>He's great!</i>

1178
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:33,894
<i>He's my student.</i>

1179
01:27:36,524 --> 01:27:38,398
<i>I'm so proud.</i>

1180
01:27:39,569 --> 01:27:40,767
Thank you.

1181
01:27:41,946 --> 01:27:43,986
Hello, welcome to our party.

1182
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,482
<i>I didn't know you could
play like that.</i>

1183
01:27:46,742 --> 01:27:48,450
<i>I'm versatile.</i>

1184
01:27:55,835 --> 01:27:58,871
<i>It's that nice young man
from the motor club.</i>

1185
01:27:59,088 --> 01:28:00,582
Thank you again.

1186
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,251
<i>It's nothing, ladies.</i>

1187
01:28:02,508 --> 01:28:05,758
<i>He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.</i>

1188
01:28:08,222 --> 01:28:09,847
What was that all about?

1189
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:13,184
<i>Don't know. They've been
hitting on me all night.</i>

1190
01:28:14,062 --> 01:28:15,437
There you are!

1191
01:28:17,398 --> 01:28:20,601
I never thanked you properly
for what you did.

1192
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,900
<i>He would've choked for sure.</i>

1193
01:28:23,154 --> 01:28:26,855
He may have. He was trying
to swallow a whole cow.

1194
01:28:27,116 --> 01:28:28,314
I owe you one, buddy.

1195
01:28:28,576 --> 01:28:31,696
<i>Hang on to him, dear.
He's a real find.</i>

1196
01:28:34,123 --> 01:28:35,831
What did you do today?

1197
01:28:36,084 --> 01:28:37,661
Same old, same old.

1198
01:28:43,424 --> 01:28:44,966
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.

1199
01:28:45,176 --> 01:28:46,754
Fred, how was the wedding?

1200
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:50,012
Thank you for making
Debbie go through with it.

1201
01:28:50,265 --> 01:28:53,301
All I did was fan her flame
of passion for you.

1202
01:28:53,559 --> 01:28:54,758
You are the best.

1203
01:28:55,019 --> 01:28:56,051
No, you are.

1204
01:28:56,312 --> 01:28:59,479
Rita, this is
Debbie and Fred Kleiser.

1205
01:28:59,732 --> 01:29:03,564
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?

1206
01:29:04,028 --> 01:29:05,855
No way!

1207
01:29:06,114 --> 01:29:09,234
WrestleMania!
No way!

1208
01:29:10,201 --> 01:29:13,155
<i>How'd you know?
We'll be in Pittsburgh anyway!</i>

1209
01:29:13,413 --> 01:29:15,240
<i>Thank you. You're a real pal.</i>

1210
01:29:15,498 --> 01:29:17,372
Oh, this is the best.

1211
01:29:22,171 --> 01:29:23,582
<i>I don't understand.</i>

1212
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,548
I guess not.

1213
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:28,802
How does everyone know you?
You come once a year.

1214
01:29:29,053 --> 01:29:30,880
<i>You're the most popular
person in town.</i>

1215
01:29:31,139 --> 01:29:33,345
Excuse me, Dr. Connors?

1216
01:29:33,558 --> 01:29:36,475
<i>I want to thank you
for fixing Felix's back.</i>

1217
01:29:36,686 --> 01:29:38,762
He can help around the house again.

1218
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:41,471
<i>Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Felix.</i>

1219
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:45,484
Dr. Connors?

1220
01:29:45,862 --> 01:29:48,187
<i>It's kind of an honorary title.</i>

1221
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:50,025
What is going on?

1222
01:29:50,241 --> 01:29:51,273
<i>I really don't know.</i>

1223
01:29:51,534 --> 01:29:53,990
There is something
going on with you.

1224
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:56,536
You want the long or short version?

1225
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:59,625
<i>Let's start with the short
and go from there.</i>

1226
01:30:05,423 --> 01:30:07,416
Okay, folks, attention.

1227
01:30:08,218 --> 01:30:11,337
Time for the bachelor auction.
You know the rules.

1228
01:30:11,596 --> 01:30:14,052
All the eligible bachelors
come in front.

1229
01:30:14,349 --> 01:30:15,808
And you ladies...

1230
01:30:16,059 --> 01:30:17,387
...you bid on them!

1231
01:30:17,644 --> 01:30:19,683
Do whatever you want with them...

1232
01:30:19,938 --> 01:30:21,515
...no questions asked!

1233
01:30:21,773 --> 01:30:24,857
<i>I don't want to know about it,
as long as it's legal.</i>

1234
01:30:25,068 --> 01:30:29,445
<i>Get out your pocketbooks,
and remember it's all for charity.</i>

1235
01:30:31,616 --> 01:30:33,194
What are you doing down here?

1236
01:30:33,451 --> 01:30:34,945
Go on, get up there.

1237
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:38,246
<i>I got 10 bucks
that says you're mine.</i>

1238
01:30:38,665 --> 01:30:40,574
Buster, I got your first victim.

1239
01:30:40,792 --> 01:30:43,461
Phil Connors, come on up here!

1240
01:30:48,508 --> 01:30:51,842
All right! Now, what am I bid
for this fine specimen?

1241
01:30:52,137 --> 01:30:53,547
Five dollars!

1242
01:30:53,763 --> 01:30:55,720
The bidding has begun
at five dollars.

1243
01:30:56,016 --> 01:30:57,261
Ten dollars!

1244
01:30:57,475 --> 01:30:58,673
Fifteen!

1245
01:30:58,893 --> 01:31:00,886
- Twenty!
- Twenty-five!

1246
01:31:01,104 --> 01:31:02,053
Thirty!

1247
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,063
- Thirty-five!
- Forty!

1248
01:31:04,274 --> 01:31:05,270
Forty-five!

1249
01:31:05,942 --> 01:31:06,973
Fifty!

1250
01:31:07,235 --> 01:31:08,184
Fifty-five!

1251
01:31:08,403 --> 01:31:09,399
Sixty!

1252
01:31:09,613 --> 01:31:11,273
<i>I'm bid $60.
Do I hear more?</i>

1253
01:31:15,076 --> 01:31:18,243
$339.88.

1254
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:25,999
<i>We won't accept any more bids.
I think that's sold...</i>

1255
01:31:26,254 --> 01:31:29,919
...to the little lady for $339.88!

1256
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:32,426
Congratulations!

1257
01:31:40,519 --> 01:31:42,428
<i>Okay, bachelors, who's next?</i>

1258
01:31:52,864 --> 01:31:56,150
All right! Now, what am I
bid for this guy?

1259
01:31:56,368 --> 01:31:58,195
Do I hear a buck and a half?

1260
01:31:58,495 --> 01:31:59,740
Anybody?

1261
01:32:00,622 --> 01:32:01,653
75 cents?

1262
01:32:01,873 --> 01:32:03,665
I bid a twopence!

1263
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:06,665
Sold to the lady for 25 cents.

1264
01:32:06,878 --> 01:32:08,420
I got him!

1265
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,385
Phil Connors,
I thought that was you.

1266
01:32:19,641 --> 01:32:22,097
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

1267
01:32:22,352 --> 01:32:23,597
<i>I'll say.</i>

1268
01:32:24,813 --> 01:32:26,770
<i>I haven't seen him for 20 years.</i>

1269
01:32:27,023 --> 01:32:32,065
He comes up and buys whole life,
term, fire, auto, dental, health...

1270
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:35,196
...with the optional death
and dismemberment plan.

1271
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:37,607
This is the best day of my life.

1272
01:32:37,868 --> 01:32:39,991
- Mine too.
- Mine too.

1273
01:32:40,203 --> 01:32:41,448
Where are we going?

1274
01:32:41,705 --> 01:32:43,413
<i>Let's not spoil it.</i>

1275
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:47,579
<i>Let's not...
I got that.</i>

1276
01:32:50,505 --> 01:32:51,916
<i>Why can't I look?</i>

1277
01:32:52,382 --> 01:32:54,209
Because you bother me a lot.

1278
01:32:54,509 --> 01:32:55,885
<i>I'm getting cold.</i>

1279
01:32:56,094 --> 01:32:57,719
How long do I have to sit here?

1280
01:32:58,347 --> 01:33:01,466
<i>I'm giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.</i>

1281
01:33:02,059 --> 01:33:04,384
Well, I think you were a bargain.

1282
01:33:05,228 --> 01:33:07,351
<i>Sweet of you to say.
You're right.</i>

1283
01:33:10,108 --> 01:33:11,519
Is it finished yet?

1284
01:33:12,402 --> 01:33:15,273
I still have to put
cherry syrup on the top...

1285
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:16,520
...then we can eat it.

1286
01:33:16,782 --> 01:33:19,451
<i>Come on, Phil.
I'm freezing!</i>

1287
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,320
One second, one second.

1288
01:33:21,578 --> 01:33:23,370
Let me turn it in the light.

1289
01:33:28,877 --> 01:33:30,371
<i>It's amazing.</i>

1290
01:33:31,129 --> 01:33:32,374
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

1291
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:38,052
How did you do that?

1292
01:33:38,887 --> 01:33:42,671
<i>I know your face so well,
I could've done it with my eyes closed.</i>

1293
01:33:47,229 --> 01:33:48,640
<i>It's lovely.</i>

1294
01:33:49,398 --> 01:33:51,225
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

1295
01:33:52,442 --> 01:33:53,641
I do.

1296
01:33:55,737 --> 01:33:58,026
No matter what happens tomorrow...

1297
01:33:58,282 --> 01:34:00,155
...or for the rest of my life...

1298
01:34:00,367 --> 01:34:02,075
<i>...I'm happy now...</i>

1299
01:34:03,287 --> 01:34:04,864
...because I love you.

1300
01:34:05,789 --> 01:34:07,581
<i>I think I'm happy too.</i>

1301
01:35:06,266 --> 01:35:07,429
<i>Please, Not again,</i>

1302
01:35:07,643 --> 01:35:09,517
<i>- That's a great song,
- It's not,</i>

1303
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:11,809
<i>Don't listen to this man...</i>

1304
01:35:12,398 --> 01:35:14,805
<i>It's too early.</i>

1305
01:35:25,536 --> 01:35:27,327
Something is different.

1306
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:29,200
Good or bad?

1307
01:35:29,581 --> 01:35:31,870
Anything different is good.

1308
01:35:34,336 --> 01:35:36,625
But this could be real good.

1309
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:42,921
Why are you here?

1310
01:35:43,387 --> 01:35:45,463
I bought you.
I own you.

1311
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:49,553
But why are you still here?

1312
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,894
<i>You said, "Stay,"
so I stayed.</i>

1313
01:35:55,566 --> 01:35:57,605
<i>I said, "Stay,"
so you stayed.</i>

1314
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:00,398
<i>I can't even make a collie stay.</i>

1315
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:04,566
I got to check something.

1316
01:36:05,367 --> 01:36:06,743
Stay.

1317
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:08,275
Stay.

1318
01:36:13,918 --> 01:36:15,198
<i>They're gone!</i>

1319
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,706
<i>They're all gone.</i>

1320
01:36:19,798 --> 01:36:22,503
- Do you know what today is?
- No, what?

1321
01:36:23,844 --> 01:36:25,837
Today is tomorrow.

1322
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:27,759
It happened.

1323
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:32,259
<i>- You're here.
- I'm here.</i>

1324
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:41,067
<i>Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell asleep.</i>

1325
01:36:42,905 --> 01:36:45,692
It was the end of a very long day.

1326
01:36:48,786 --> 01:36:52,570
Is there anything I can do
for you today?

1327
01:36:53,457 --> 01:36:56,079
<i>I'm sure I can think of something.</i>

1328
01:37:29,201 --> 01:37:31,194
<i>It's so beautiful!</i>

1329
01:37:41,839 --> 01:37:43,464
<i>Let's live here.</i>

1330
01:37:53,935 --> 01:37:55,974
<i>We'll rent to start.</i>

1331
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:01,611
