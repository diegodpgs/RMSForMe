1
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,756
-Good sleep?
-Not bad.

2
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:36,392
So where are we?

3
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:37,653
Where you from?

4
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,024
San Diego.
Left yesterday.

5
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:42,996
So you came Honolulu-Guam-Pago-here?

6
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,431
Long trip.

7
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:47,093
What do you do?

8
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,268
l'm a psychologist.

9
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,272
Hey, a shrink.

10
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:53,606
They've called in everything else.

11
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:54,834
How do you mean?

12
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:57,504
We've ferried people out of Guam
for the last 2 days.

13
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,510
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians,
you name it.

14
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,086
Everybody being flown to the middle
of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.

15
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:05,278
What's going on?

16
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:09,526
They're not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?

17
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,126
There was a plane crash.

18
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:13,092
Do you get called in on crashes?

19
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:17,462
l'm on a list of psychologists the FAA
brings in when a plane goes down.

20
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,270
So where exactly are we now?

21
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:22,540
That's where we're headed.
Over there.

22
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:23,866
Here.

23
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,134
Take a look.

24
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:27,942
What is that?

25
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,816
All that for a plane crash?

26
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:37,316
l never mentioned a plane crash.

27
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:53,564
Any other gear?
Watch your step.

28
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:54,932
l'd like to call my family.

29
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,234
We'll get you settled in quarters first.
Remain there till we send for you.

30
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,741
-l'd like to get started.
-We'll send for you.

31
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:02,413
-lt's critical l see them--
-Who?

32
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:05,072
The survivors. lf l don't get to them
in the first 24 hours--

33
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:07,274
-What survivors?
-The survivors of the plane crash.

34
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:08,980
Plane crash?

35
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:12,419
l deal in post-traumatic stress
and survival guilt.

36
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:14,991
Maybe l should talk to someone
who knows what's going on here.

37
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:17,093
-Talk to the ship's psychiatrist.
-l'm a psychologist.

38
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:18,626
That's why l was sent here.

39
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,525
l told you people l need a phone.

40
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:22,130
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.

41
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:24,928
That's fine. Give me a phone,
l'll call him.

42
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:26,125
Why are you here?

43
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:29,034
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who l am?

44
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:30,866
Tell him the name
of the book you wrote.

45
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:34,044
Astrophysics You Can Use . lt was a
Book-of-the-Month Club Main Selection.

46
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,974
Never heard of it.

47
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:40,208
You really thought he read your book.
You haven't changed.

48
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:41,884
lt was written for the layman.

49
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,179
He's not impressed.

50
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:44,821
ls there a phone in here?

51
00:05:45,023 --> 00:05:49,050
-l've been trying to call my wife.
-Would you stop touching me?

52
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:50,318
Wait a minute.

53
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:52,153
Beth?

54
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,468
Flight quarters. All units
make your flight quarters...

55
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:02,767
...condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail--

56
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:06,572
Goodman, you been here long?

57
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:08,472
-l've been here 3 hours.
-Welcome aboard.

58
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,705
This thing scares the hell out of me.

59
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,044
lt's already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back...

60
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:17,517
...because the damage is done
to the survivors already.

61
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:20,384
-Hold on. We'll get to that.
-l don't even know who you are.

62
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:21,650
l know who you are.

63
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,727
Who are you? Navy? Military?
What are you?

64
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,693
You ever hear of the OSSA?

65
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:29,492
They don't know who l am.
That should reassure you.

66
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:32,159
You haven't talked to anyone about this?

67
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:34,999
-l talked to the helicopter pilot.
-What'd you tell him?

68
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:38,768
l told him l was here to see
the plane crash. That's my job.

69
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,205
Plane crash. Good.

70
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:44,212
There was no plane crash.

71
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,417
Spacecraft.

72
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:49,447
A spacecraft.
l guess that explains a lot.

73
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:51,451
-NASA?
-That doesn't surprise you?

74
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,417
At least it explains the secrecy.

75
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:57,219
The secrecy's critical, Norman.
You made that explicit in your report.

76
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:00,124
What report?

77
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:01,762
ULF.

78
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:05,134
l wrote that
for the Bush administration.

79
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,928
And that's our bible here.

80
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:11,738
But that was a report about a possible
encounter with an alien being.

81
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:16,377
You want to come with me?

82
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:20,715
Oh, boy.

83
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,113
About 3 weeks ago...

84
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,983
...a ship laying fiber-optic cable
between Honolulu and Sydney...

85
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:28,784
...hit an obstruction
1 ,000 feet underwater.

86
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:31,792
Cut this cable here
clean as a shears.

87
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:34,659
The Navy got interested,
sent out a search ship.

88
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,231
lt turned out that what did it...

89
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:38,892
...was this.

90
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:41,163
We took this with side-looking sonar.

91
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:44,170
This is an aerodynamic fin
longer than a football field...

92
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:45,966
...bigger than any known wingspan.

93
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:48,108
This is the fuselage.

94
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:52,407
This is ultrahigh-res SLS bottom scan.
Came in a week ago.

95
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:55,781
There it is, buried
under about 8 yards of coral.

96
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:58,418
Something's wrong
with that measurement.

97
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:02,315
Pacific coral grows an inch a year.
You can set your watch by it.

98
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:03,516
That's right.

99
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:07,596
So you're saying this spacecraft
crashed in the year....

100
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,155
1 709.

101
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:12,131
So you're saying this spacecraft crashed
300 years ago?

102
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:13,770
288.

103
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:14,927
That's impossible.

104
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:18,609
lt's not impossible if this spacecraft
came from an alien civilization.

105
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:21,434
Wait a minute.

106
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:23,307
You think this is an alien spacecraft?

107
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:25,142
lt's not impossible.
lt's ridiculous.

108
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,116
We think there's an Unknown Life Form on
the spacecraft. That's why you're here.

109
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:33,181
You are the contact team that
was recommended in the Goodman Report.

110
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,387
We have a biochemist...

111
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:38,357
...to assess the physiology
of the Unknown Life Form.

112
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:41,691
A mathematician, because that'll
probably be our common language.

113
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:45,060
And we have an astrophysicist
to locate its place in the cosmos.

114
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:46,998
-Led by a psychologist.
-Right.

115
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:50,538
Nowadays, the little green men say,
''Take me to your therapist''?

116
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:52,665
Listen up.

117
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:56,375
''Contact teams meeting
an Unknown Life Form or ULF...

118
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:59,141
...must be prepared
for severe psychological impact.

119
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:03,310
Stress reaction of confronting such life
has not been sufficiently studied...

120
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:05,989
...and cannot be entirely predicted
in advance.

121
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:09,058
But the most likely consequence
of contact is...

122
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,659
...absolute terror.''

123
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,319
That's from Norman's report.

124
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,158
l'm sorry, are these parameters correct?

125
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,834
You're saying that you have a spacecraft
over a half a mile long...

126
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:23,269
...that crashed into the ocean 300 years
ago and it's completely intact?

127
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:24,869
That's right.

128
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:29,012
And the kicker is, our sonar
is picking up a low-level hum.

129
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:30,579
Something's still running inside.

130
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:33,717
There's no way this coral could've grown
faster than an inch a year?

131
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:36,247
That's what we're going there to see.

132
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:37,318
What?

133
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:38,386
Who says?

134
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:40,884
Harry, that's a joke, right?

135
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:44,391
This is the greatest scientific
discovery since Copernicus. Bigger!

136
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:47,463
The idea that we're not alone,
it'll change everything.

137
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:51,635
Evidence of extraterrestrial life.
You don't want to see that?

138
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,397
l got to say that l resent
this briefing very much.

139
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:56,699
And how's that?

140
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,268
lf Norman's report calls for a biologist,
a mathematician...

141
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:02,708
...an astrophysicist
and a psychologist...

142
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,142
...why are you here?

143
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:07,545
Physical protocols
start in a half an hour.

144
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:09,415
You always wear glasses?

145
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,951
l just started wearing these.

146
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,087
Are the glasses a problem?
l don't actually need them.

147
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:17,420
They're just for reading.

148
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,893
And they're more of a crutch.
l see fine without them.

149
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:24,558
But they didn't anticipate
l'd be going 1 ,000 feet under the water.

150
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,259
Do you take prescription medication?

151
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:27,460
No.

152
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:29,230
None at all?

153
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,274
Once in a while
sometimes l might take like a...

154
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,412
...a piece of Xanax
or something if l'm nervous.

155
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:38,980
Something like that.

156
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:40,310
But not...

157
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:41,985
...much.

158
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:46,314
lKnee surgery. Complete reconstruction
of ACL, right knee.

159
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:50,585
Still have steel pin here, steel pin
here, little medial collateral damage.

160
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:53,261
l see that you have a scar
on your neck.

161
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:54,921
Car accident.

162
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,498
-Were you drinking?
-Yeah.

163
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,034
But l wasn't driving.

164
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:04,168
Wait, l just want to apologize
for putting your name on the list.

165
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,273
Why?

166
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:09,436
When l made the report a few years ago,
l picked names of people l knew.

167
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:10,546
And?

168
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:13,946
l know Ted because of his father.

169
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:15,983
-Yeah, so what?
-Beth was a patient.

170
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,788
lt's a bogus report.

171
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:20,321
What? Did you tell Barnes?

172
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:23,186
You can't do that.
That's fraud.

173
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:27,290
They came to me, new administration,
right? Political agenda.

174
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:30,865
They said, in case of an alien invasion,
do's and don'ts.

175
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:32,229
Why didn't you just say no?

176
00:11:33,538 --> 00:11:34,869
$35,000.

177
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:36,404
lt paid the down payment
on my house.

178
00:11:36,641 --> 00:11:39,667
New administration wanted to prove
they're doing something new.

179
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:42,141
How'd you come up with this team...

180
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:45,248
...of a biologist, an astrophysicist
and a mathematician?

181
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:46,541
Right.

182
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:48,548
-How?
-l don't know.

183
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:52,154
lt sounded good, right?
Made them come to me.

184
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,722
l forgive you, Norman.
l forgive you!

185
00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:58,087
But l don't forgive you for Ted.
He's a pain in the ass.

186
00:11:58,363 --> 00:11:59,591
l'll talk to him.

187
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,924
We'll be there 2 hours.
You don't have to be around him.

188
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,533
He idolizes you anyways, but l'll talk
to him. l'll buy you dinner.

189
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:09,104
-l'm sorry.
-Your secret's safe with me. Come on.

190
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:12,376
l can't believe this thing could....
Like a dream.

191
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:14,272
Have you called your wife?

192
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:15,706
Why not?

193
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:19,172
This'll be a saturation dive.

194
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,281
You'll be going to a habitat
in 1 ,000 feet of water.

195
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:25,249
A sub will take you to the Habitat
and you'll transfer aboard.

196
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:29,118
At 1 ,000 feet, your body
will be pressurized for that depth.

197
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,691
You could actually take a quick dip.
The pressure wouldn't bother you.

198
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:36,197
Although l wouldn't recommend it
because the water's so cold...

199
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:39,369
...you'd freeze to death
in less than 2 minutes.

200
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,437
That's the reason for the diving suits.

201
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,608
Your helmet has a rebreather
for your air supply.

202
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:48,810
Following this briefing, l'll take you
to an onboard dive tank.

203
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,542
For the next 8 hours...

204
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:54,206
...you'll train in deep-saturation dive
techniques and emergency procedures.

205
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,550
Once you've gone down 1 ,000 feet...

206
00:12:56,721 --> 00:13:00,316
...if you surface, you'll have to commit
to several days of decompression.

207
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:04,424
There is no real quick return.

208
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:05,994
However, there is a mini-sub...

209
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:08,562
...that may be used as an emergency
escape vehicle.

210
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:11,462
But there must be a ship at the surface
to mate to for decompression.

211
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:15,127
Without decompression,
your body would literally burst.

212
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:18,567
Under these circumstances,
you're very well-controlled.

213
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:22,270
The dive has been planned well
and professionally monitored.

214
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:48,630
The descent will take about 1 3 minutes,
descending at 80 feet a minute.

215
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:52,173
lt's going to get chilly.

216
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:55,806
Try to relax.

217
00:13:57,615 --> 00:14:00,482
Next time, just tell us
when you're going to push the button.

218
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:10,453
Mozart...

219
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:12,891
... Horn Concerto in E-flat ...

220
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:14,860
... K-447 .

221
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:40,153
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?

222
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:41,825
-l'm loose.
-You're loose?

223
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:43,255
l'm loose. l'm loose.

224
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,017
l'm uptight.

225
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:47,094
-We okay?
-We're in the river now.

226
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:48,355
What river?

227
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:50,830
lt's a temperature/salinity
differential.

228
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:53,162
lt flows like a river
inside the ocean.

229
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:57,167
-Under the ocean and there's a river.
-That's right.

230
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,547
You okay?

231
00:15:03,781 --> 00:15:06,341
Right now, l'm not okay.
Would you please not touch me?

232
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:08,781
We're both nervous. Yes?

233
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,219
Would you cut that out, please?

234
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,757
You're having a stress reaction.
That's Harry's stress reaction.

235
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:23,260
Those noises we're hearing,
that's normal?

236
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:27,768
Those noises are the water pressure
attacking the sub's integrity.

237
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,369
You know a little something about that,
don't you, Norman?

238
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,136
How the pressure
can attack your integrity.

239
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:37,571
Come on, you be nice this trip.

240
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:39,914
Were you nice last time?

241
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:45,988
You two want to sit together?

242
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,218
My God!

243
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:52,919
Norman, look at this, look at this.

244
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:56,499
Jesus! That's just the fin.

245
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:33,426
That's the Habitat.

246
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:37,437
The Navy moved it in sections
and set it up as a base...

247
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:40,099
...as soon as the spaceship
was discovered.

248
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:42,502
It's manned by 2 naval personnel.

249
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,207
It will be your home-away-from-home
while we investigate the spacecraft.

250
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:49,014
lt ain't the Motel 6.

251
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:03,865
Approaching docking bay from R-4.

252
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:25,151
All personnel, descent sub one
engaging lock area.

253
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:30,756
You are now depressurized.

254
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,109
We're going to pressurize you now.

255
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:55,376
lt's hot in there, but you're going to
feel coolness. That's the helium.

256
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:58,517
-Helium?
-Was l the only one paying attention?

257
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:03,056
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same
family as fluorine and chlorine...

258
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,091
...hydrochloric acid,
hydrofluoric acid.

259
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:07,093
That's why we're breathing helium.

260
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:10,893
Because oxygen at any level
higher than 2.3 becomes toxic.

261
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:14,694
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
l don't speak balloon.

262
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:16,962
What?

263
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,905
That's my voice. The helium resonates
differently with my vocal chords.

264
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:23,041
''Follow the yellow brick road.''

265
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:25,580
lKiddies, cut it out.

266
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:28,044
The voice regulators are behind you.
Put them on.

267
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,982
The Navy dive team is setting up
a hydraulic robot...

268
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,384
...in the air lock
outside the spacecraft.

269
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:36,924
We'll use that to open its door.

270
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:39,796
ls that the door?

271
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:44,560
Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint
it before the divers went down.

272
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:48,463
-How tall is that robot?
-Five feet.

273
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:51,506
And it's roughly the same size
as an airplane door, isn't it?

274
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:54,233
-Excuse me, Ted.
-l think that's worth taking note of.

275
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:57,813
Excuse me. Tell them our team
is in place and ready, okay?

276
00:18:57,982 --> 00:19:00,007
This is Habitat to Navy dive.

277
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:03,245
Has it occurred to anyone
maybe we shouldn't open that door?

278
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:05,148
Why do you say that?

279
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:07,017
We assume they'll be green...

280
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:08,748
...or insect-like,
but basically human.

281
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:12,123
But what if they inhale air
and exhale cyanide gas? lt's plausible.

282
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,627
Or live forever,
like a virus or a yeast.

283
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,034
But why would you assume that an ULF
would want to kill us?

284
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:20,703
An immortal creature wouldn't think
killing was right or wrong.

285
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:22,270
lt'd have no concept of it.

286
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,534
lnstant eradication. lt's what all the
serious scientific stuff talks about.

287
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:27,209
What little there is on the subject.

288
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,345
You did put that in your report?

289
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:30,978
lt's in there.

290
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:37,621
Get us the ETD for team's departure
to surface.

291
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,779
Tell them we're in ready
and thank them.

292
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:42,687
Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team's ready to take over.

293
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,522
Descent sub ready
for your return to surface.

294
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:48,665
Thanks for all your help.
We'll let you know what we find.

295
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:02,839
l'm not too thrilled
at the prospect of this.

296
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,980
What if you have to go to the bathroom?

297
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:06,639
Just go down your leg, Ted.

298
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:08,507
Really?

299
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,084
You can urinate in these?

300
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,310
You can.

301
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,014
The question is, do you want to?

302
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,994
Where's the switch?

303
00:20:33,644 --> 00:20:35,339
Okay, let's go.

304
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,171
All right, Fletcher...

305
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:11,840
...we're at 1 ,022 feet.

306
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:15,651
The ambient temperature,
34 degrees.

307
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,087
Heading out north-northwest...

308
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:20,055
...330.

309
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:22,455
lt's a firm bottom.

310
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,786
lntermittent coral.

311
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:28,529
This is great, you guys.

312
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:55,123
Look at the size of that thing!

313
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:02,459
My God!

314
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:10,567
You see that tunnel?

315
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,472
That's where we're going.

316
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:17,346
lnto the heart of darkness.

317
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:36,360
We're in the coral pipe now, Fletcher,
approaching the air lock.

318
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:39,527
l'm feeling pressure in my ears.
ls that normal?

319
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:41,830
Just use your equalizer.

320
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,034
A little better.

321
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:48,010
The most toxic creatures on Earth
live down here.

322
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:51,545
The venom of the land animal
is nothing by comparison.

323
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:55,679
Even the weakest sea snake
is invariably lethal.

324
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:58,418
ls that supposed to make me
feel good, Beth?

325
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:02,017
This is our air lock.

326
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:06,522
lt'll take us from a wet
to a dry environment.

327
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:10,156
We're assuming the inside
of the ship is sealed.

328
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,358
This thing is enormous.

329
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:25,665
That's not budging, is it?

330
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:27,907
-Turn it at 45 degrees.
-What's happening here?

331
00:24:28,112 --> 00:24:29,340
Is that piston broken?

332
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:32,310
Can you get the suction cup
flat to the plane of the door?

333
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:33,983
Maybe it's the hydraulics.

334
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:36,709
The pressure messes everything up
at this depth.

335
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:40,885
Time for a demonstration
in basic physics, gentlemen.

336
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:49,196
What is it, Harry?

337
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,594
Take a look.

338
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:51,892
lt's chipped.

339
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:53,501
All right, it's chipped.
So what?

340
00:24:53,704 --> 00:24:56,502
l thought you said this thing
wasn't damaged when it crashed...

341
00:24:56,707 --> 00:25:00,268
...that this titanium alloy was
so super-strong, you can't hurt it.

342
00:25:00,677 --> 00:25:01,837
l did.

343
00:25:02,513 --> 00:25:05,141
So why does it chip when this scientist
just bangs it with a hammer?

344
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:06,849
ls there heat coming off this thing?

345
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:10,277
You're right. Get out of there.
Back up.

346
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:11,886
Just a minute.

347
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:13,818
l mean, get back now!
Get back.

348
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,583
Jesus.

349
00:25:29,506 --> 00:25:32,737
Anybody else wonder who the hell
opened that door?

350
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:37,011
How did that happen?

351
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:42,244
l'm not sure about the atmosphere.
Helmets stay on.

352
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:43,613
All right.

353
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,114
We come in peace.

354
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:49,525
Always wanted to say that.

355
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:57,295
Fletcher, inform the Navy
we've gained access...

356
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:59,332
...to the spacecraft.

357
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,264
There's a hell of a lot of
radiation shielding in here.

358
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:07,339
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing...

359
00:26:09,346 --> 00:26:11,109
...and a lot of steam.

360
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:15,209
lt's endless.
We'll stay in touch here.

361
00:26:27,164 --> 00:26:28,256
Somebody's been here.

362
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:32,161
There's footsteps
and they ain't ours.

363
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,637
So what do you say, Norman?
Time to turn back?

364
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,207
l'm a little curious.

365
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:44,112
Break up into 2 squads. We'll
never cover the territory otherwise.

366
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:45,246
Split up?

367
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:49,180
He's got a point. We've only got about
a half-hour of breathing time left.

368
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:51,547
Ted and Harry,
you come with me.

369
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:54,690
Beth, Norman, stick together.
Come on.

370
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:57,926
l think the people who built this place
would call that ''divide and conquer.''

371
00:26:58,128 --> 00:27:01,529
Whoever built this thing wanted us dead,
we'd be dead already.

372
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:07,895
These guys offer a federal grant to
study the effects of an alien invasion.

373
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:09,834
l told all this to Harry.

374
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,337
You made up the report?

375
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:14,136
No, not all of it. l mean,
l did research on half of it.

376
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:15,504
Who did the other half?

377
00:27:15,812 --> 00:27:19,077
l borrowed from, you know,
good writers.

378
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:21,682
lsaac Asimov, Rod Serling....

379
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,679
Rod Serling?

380
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:28,085
Who would've thought anyone even reads
those government reports. You know?

381
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:31,158
l show up here,
half the Pacific fleet is here.

382
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:34,489
l just didn't know what to do.
l wanted to tell you, that's all.

383
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:38,900
ls this in the same category as, ''Beth,
l thought you knew l was married''?

384
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,605
l don't think we have enough oxygen--

385
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:51,003
-Oh, my God.
-Did you push something?

386
00:27:51,748 --> 00:27:53,409
No. lt did it on its own.

387
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,040
That must be the cockpit.

388
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:27,376
Hold on.

389
00:28:31,822 --> 00:28:34,791
Look at this. Cross-stress bracing
on the outer hulls.

390
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:37,153
All axes supported.
Look at this stuff.

391
00:28:37,494 --> 00:28:41,089
This is interesting.
Soft and strong at the same time.

392
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:44,131
lt's, like, better than rubber,
better than steel.

393
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:45,865
You know a lot
about this stuff.

394
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:48,594
l studied aeronautical engineering
at M.l.T.

395
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:50,602
lsn't that where you got your Ph.D.?

396
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:53,275
lt's where l got mine.
All 3 of them.

397
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:54,633
l hated M.l.T.

398
00:28:54,845 --> 00:28:55,573
Envy?

399
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:56,575
Puberty.

400
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,610
How old?

401
00:28:58,115 --> 00:28:59,742
First Ph.D., 1 8.

402
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,939
Damn.

403
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:03,449
One year, Harry.
You beat me by one year.

404
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,344
Let's push on.

405
00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:06,720
Let's go.

406
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:10,290
Man, they didn't tell you how heavy
these things were out of the water.

407
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:14,855
Look at this.

408
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:16,460
Come here.

409
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,070
''Trash.''

410
00:29:22,272 --> 00:29:23,432
'' Basura .''

411
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:25,905
Trash?

412
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:40,820
Oh, God.

413
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:45,393
Jesus!

414
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:48,887
lt's human.

415
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:51,325
You mean humanoid.

416
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:54,497
No, Norman, l mean human.

417
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:56,029
Blunt force trauma.

418
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:58,997
You can see by the direction
that the fracture runs...

419
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:00,733
...that he was hit
in the back of the head.

420
00:30:01,478 --> 00:30:02,467
What's in his hand?

421
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,344
l don't know.

422
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,714
What is it?

423
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:14,323
''Smokehouse Almonds''?

424
00:30:16,393 --> 00:30:18,691
My God, it's an American spaceship.

425
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:20,590
lt can't be
an American spaceship.

426
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:23,664
lt's 300 years old. There weren't
even Americans, let alone spaceships.

427
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:25,858
lt can't be, but it is.

428
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:30,139
Let's see if there's some kind of
flight recorder or data computer...

429
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,706
...where we can ring up
some kind...

430
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:34,774
...of a flight history.
l mean....

431
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,448
Look at this. lt's in English.
Come here.

432
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:46,886
Okay, good.

433
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:49,256
Right there.

434
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:51,083
And there.

435
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,565
Look at the dates!

436
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:01,393
Can't be.

437
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:03,664
Could be.

438
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:06,138
lt could be 2043 or 1 643.

439
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:08,072
l don't know
which one is weirder.

440
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:18,082
''Unknown Entry Event.''
Press it.

441
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,484
You sure?

442
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,948
This is Barnes, Norman.

443
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,093
Yeah, l can hear you.

444
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:37,363
l can't explain it, but l think
we're inside an American spaceship.

445
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:39,995
It gets better.

446
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:48,239
What the hell is it?

447
00:32:48,478 --> 00:32:51,970
Whatever it is, it seems to be
what this bird was designed to do.

448
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:56,016
Go out into space and gather
things like this up and bring it back.

449
00:32:56,219 --> 00:32:57,811
Yeah, but back from where?

450
00:32:58,021 --> 00:32:59,579
Don't get too excited, Ted.

451
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:03,317
Turn this thing over,
it'll probably say ''Made in lKorea.''

452
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:05,085
Somehow l doubt that.

453
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:06,726
No doors.

454
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,989
No hinges of any kind.

455
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:15,104
l'll bet if you put a laser micrometer
on this, it'd be a perfect sphere.

456
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:20,108
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That's a message in and of itself.

457
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:22,004
-Really?
-What do you mean?

458
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,612
When Pope Benedict asked Giotto
to prove his worth as an artist...

459
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:31,013
...Giotto drew a perfect circle...

460
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:32,888
...freehand.

461
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,218
Perfection.
lt's a powerful message.

462
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:39,926
-l know what the Zen masters would say.
-What's that?

463
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:43,158
''This ball wants to be caught.''

464
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:46,468
Nobody built this thing
looking into their third eye.

465
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:49,433
They went to a lot of trouble
and they didn't do it for nothing.

466
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:52,972
Something put this thing out there
to get picked up and brought back here.

467
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:56,370
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
lt could be a trap.

468
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,309
Don't you think
that's a little paranoid?

469
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:02,178
No, l'm going to put a video camera
on this thing and keep an eye on it.

470
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:06,087
Can l ask you something
about this reflective surface?

471
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:08,518
Yeah, it appears to be mercury,
doesn't it?

472
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:11,125
Except mercury's liquid
at this temperature.

473
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,989
No, that's not
what l'm talking about.

474
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:17,124
What worries me is that
it's reflecting everything but us.

475
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:24,669
l hate to be the one non-scientist
that picks this up, guys.

476
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:26,707
You know what l mean?

477
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:29,871
What do you think it is?

478
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:33,009
l don't know.

479
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:35,508
Whatever it is...

480
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:38,084
...it's alien.

481
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:50,024
Okay, an American spacecraft,
materials, technology...

482
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:52,963
...more advanced than what we know,
crashes into the ocean.

483
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:54,295
Why wasn't it damaged?

484
00:34:54,638 --> 00:34:57,471
The materials are
obviously super-strong.

485
00:34:57,674 --> 00:34:59,733
lf that's true, why did it chip
when you hit it?

486
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:06,540
Better:

487
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:08,406
lt didn't crash.

488
00:35:08,952 --> 00:35:10,317
lt arrived...

489
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:12,312
...300 years ago.

490
00:35:12,522 --> 00:35:14,752
-From where?
-Not ''where.'' When.

491
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:17,426
So you're saying this thing
took a wrong turn?

492
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:19,686
That's right. l mean,
what if the craft...

493
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:22,160
...inadvertently flew
into a black hole?

494
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:25,198
lt arrived in our past from its present.

495
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:26,892
The dates
in the flight record--

496
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:28,627
43, 47.

497
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,329
That has to be 2043, 2047.

498
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:33,634
The image you saw,
what you described...

499
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:36,175
...sounds like a black hole,
a tear in the space--

500
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:37,971
We know
what a black hole is.

501
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:39,273
l don't know.

502
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:43,350
lt's a collapsed star with so much
gravity it's like a vacuum cleaner...

503
00:35:43,553 --> 00:35:46,522
...sucking everything into it,
light, interstellar dust, time--

504
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:48,816
-Time?
-lt's possible, but not plausible.

505
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:51,721
lt's more than probable.
lt's rudimentary astrophysics.

506
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:54,726
We just haven't been able
to fly into one and prove it.

507
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:17,315
l just got off the horn topside.
They're expecting a bad blow up there.

508
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,215
And they're pulling us out.

509
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:22,687
Pulling us out? Wait a minute!
What do you mean?

510
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:24,587
What part of ''pull out''
don't you understand?

511
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:26,659
Extraction.
We're leaving.

512
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:30,456
That's ridiculous. We haven't even
begun to scratch the surface here.

513
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:35,229
lf you've ever seen a Pacific cyclone,
what we call a tornado is a little fart.

514
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:38,666
So l suggest you go back
to the dormitory and take a nap.

515
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:41,810
You need to lower your metabolism
before we start the decompression.

516
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:45,003
You're leaving a time-traveling
spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?

517
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:46,715
l'm just following my orders.

518
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:49,544
We're the aliens' Welcome Wagons.
But, no aliens.

519
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:51,653
-lt was made in America.
-What's your point?

520
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:54,949
My point is, l'm a biochemist
and there's no life down here.

521
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:56,486
What is wrong with you?!

522
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:59,526
That doesn't mean there's
nothing to learn, to explore!

523
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:00,753
She's right.

524
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,557
You guys are the human contact team
for an Unknown Life Form.

525
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:08,260
There is no Unknown Life Form
so we pull out at 0900.

526
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:10,302
-Please say something to him.
-What?

527
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:12,634
l don't know. Do you not have
an opinion about this?

528
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:14,173
l'm delighted
we're going back up top.

529
00:37:14,978 --> 00:37:16,070
You know what l mean?

530
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:19,112
This may look like a roadside diner,
but in the meantime...

531
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:22,113
...my ears won't pop and if l pull
this thing away from my neck...

532
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:25,754
...l sound like someone's squeezing
my testicles. Let's go home.

533
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:32,823
Barnes is wrong, you know.

534
00:37:33,563 --> 00:37:35,497
You mean,
wrong about the storm?

535
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:38,894
No, about the Sphere.

536
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:41,201
What about the Sphere?

537
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:42,894
lt's alive.

538
00:37:51,948 --> 00:37:53,643
Why do you say that?

539
00:37:56,052 --> 00:37:57,679
There's something inside it.

540
00:37:58,988 --> 00:38:02,082
How can there be anything inside it?
There's no door, no seams.

541
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:06,384
The Sphere chooses what it will
and won't reflect.

542
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:09,861
Doesn't that seem like the actions
of a conscious being to you?

543
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:15,426
Pop psychology. l think,
for whatever it's worth, you're angry...

544
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:18,232
...towards our friend Ted in there...

545
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:20,602
...because he figured this out
before you did.

546
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:24,638
You really think so?

547
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:27,344
l don't know. This is
my first underwater session.

548
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:34,683
You're right.

549
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:38,556
Ted did figure it out first,
didn't he?

550
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:41,027
Good shrinkage.

551
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:51,738
We're all going to die down here,
you know.

552
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,268
What?

553
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:57,871
What?

554
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:03,209
You see, it's curious.

555
00:39:04,654 --> 00:39:06,019
Ted did figure it out.

556
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:09,884
Time travel. And when we get back,
we're going to tell everyone...

557
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:13,392
...how it's possible, how it's done,
what the dangers are.

558
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,793
But why 50 years in the future, when the
spacecraft encounters a black hole...

559
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,560
...does the computer call it
an ''Unknown Entry Event''?

560
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:21,236
Why don't they know?

561
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:22,701
lf they don't know...

562
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:25,498
...it means we never told anyone.

563
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,767
And if we never told anyone...

564
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:30,172
...it means we never made it back.

565
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,472
Hence...

566
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:33,749
...we die down here.

567
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,978
Just as a matter
of deductive logic, Norman.

568
00:39:44,527 --> 00:39:47,462
Damn, l wish l could
get inside that Sphere.

569
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:00,169
-What's wrong?
-Talk to Mr. Barnes.

570
00:40:00,376 --> 00:40:01,934
-Where is he?
-Video feed room.

571
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:04,909
Where is that? l don't know
where the hell anything is.

572
00:40:05,415 --> 00:40:06,643
Where am l?

573
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:08,347
Where?

574
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:10,708
What's going on?

575
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,387
l don't know.
You tell me.

576
00:40:16,392 --> 00:40:18,451
-What the hell is he doing?
-l don't know.

577
00:40:18,661 --> 00:40:20,686
Do you know what he's doing?

578
00:40:20,897 --> 00:40:22,762
-l need to know what you know.
-Nothing.

579
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:24,194
He wanted to go inside.

580
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,561
We are inside.
You mean outside?

581
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:29,465
-He said, ''inside.''
-What? lnside the spacecraft?

582
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:32,038
l think inside the Sphere.

583
00:41:23,593 --> 00:41:24,855
Holy shit!

584
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:26,786
My God.

585
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,354
Did he go inside?

586
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,999
-l don't think so.
-What the hell's going on?

587
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:33,259
He didn't just disappear.

588
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:35,767
l think it's a glitch in the video.

589
00:41:35,972 --> 00:41:37,667
Give me playback on that.

590
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:39,432
You'll have it in a minute.

591
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:41,473
You knew he was doing this
and you said nothing.

592
00:41:42,345 --> 00:41:44,279
-You didn't think!
-l didn't think it possible.

593
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,538
Where are Beth and Ted?

594
00:41:45,748 --> 00:41:49,741
l don't know. l woke up, l heard
bells ringing and l started running--

595
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:51,943
I'm not getting an image
on the sub.

596
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:54,789
Impossible!
I got a cable in my quarters!

597
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:56,322
They'll be here in 25 minutes or less!

598
00:41:56,526 --> 00:41:59,495
The only logical explanation
is that the sub is still at the surface.

599
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:01,822
ls it also logically possible
your sonar is messed up?!

600
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,862
Let's just calm down, all right?

601
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:06,763
He didn't just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.

602
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:10,962
You got that right. l am not going to
lose a civilian on my watch.

603
00:42:11,207 --> 00:42:13,198
You have just screwed up
our trip to the surface.

604
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:14,876
We are not going up to the surface.

605
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:16,872
Harry!
We are not going up!

606
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,707
Harry! Can you hear me?

607
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:20,712
Harry, can you hear me?

608
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:23,981
Norman, this is not a triage situation.

609
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,357
Go find me Ted and Beth.

610
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,424
Norman, stop.

611
00:42:56,953 --> 00:42:58,079
Still no reading on the sub.

612
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:00,778
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.

613
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,154
When Beth and Ted get here, make sure
they don't go anywhere. All right?

614
00:43:50,873 --> 00:43:52,340
What the hell?

615
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:53,839
Can you hear me?

616
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:10,018
ls he alive?

617
00:44:10,493 --> 00:44:13,792
We have a problem.
Harry's out cold. His pulse is normal.

618
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,223
All his vitals are normal...

619
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:18,099
...but l don't get it.

620
00:44:36,419 --> 00:44:38,114
Hello. Hello!

621
00:44:47,263 --> 00:44:51,723
Norman, can you hear me?
We lost video here. Can you hear me?

622
00:44:54,503 --> 00:44:56,630
-That tears it.
-What, sir?

623
00:44:57,139 --> 00:44:58,470
We're on internal power.

624
00:44:59,242 --> 00:45:00,174
I don't follow you.

625
00:45:00,643 --> 00:45:04,602
They cut us loose, Teeny.
For some reason the sub turned back.

626
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:06,972
Break out your 5-day deodorant pads.

627
00:45:07,183 --> 00:45:08,980
We're here for the duration.

628
00:45:18,494 --> 00:45:19,825
Everything's normal.

629
00:45:27,169 --> 00:45:29,194
What's going on?
ls he all right?

630
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:32,038
ls it true? Did he go inside?
What did he say?

631
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,476
He didn't say.
He's aphasic.

632
00:45:35,678 --> 00:45:37,077
He's asleep, Ted.

633
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,340
l can't believe he went inside.
He didn't say anything?

634
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:42,881
There's no door, no entry.
How did he get in?

635
00:45:52,094 --> 00:45:53,994
Can I have your attention, please?

636
00:45:54,196 --> 00:45:56,096
We've lost contact with the surface.

637
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:59,698
The Habitat is now operating
solely under internal power.

638
00:46:00,269 --> 00:46:02,703
We have plenty of food, oxygen
and fresh water...

639
00:46:02,905 --> 00:46:04,896
...to sustain us
until the storm is over...

640
00:46:05,107 --> 00:46:07,905
...and we reestablish contact
with the surface.

641
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:11,637
But until that time,
this mission is subject...

642
00:46:11,847 --> 00:46:14,145
...to emergency authority
under my command.

643
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:44,042
l'm taking this out
to the mini-sub.

644
00:46:44,246 --> 00:46:47,079
-Are you up on the duty roster?
-Yes, sir.

645
00:46:49,418 --> 00:46:50,612
Where's she going?

646
00:46:50,886 --> 00:46:54,344
lt's procedures. Everything
in the Habitat is videoed.

647
00:46:54,957 --> 00:46:59,690
Every 1 2 hours we take the videos to
the mini-sub and press the reset button.

648
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:03,095
The idea is, if something happens to us
and we don't reset it...

649
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:06,132
...the sub goes to the surface
automatically.

650
00:47:06,335 --> 00:47:10,465
lf we're all dead, they at least have
a partial record of what went wrong.

651
00:47:11,307 --> 00:47:12,865
Cheerful thought, huh?

652
00:47:13,943 --> 00:47:15,467
Mind the store a minute.

653
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:18,170
l'm going to the head.

654
00:48:00,523 --> 00:48:02,013
What the hell's that?

655
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,328
lt's so beautiful down here.

656
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:15,600
lt's so tranquil.

657
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,571
This is beautiful.

658
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:22,710
lt's hard to believe we have a typhoon
1 ,000 feet above our heads.

659
00:48:23,712 --> 00:48:25,907
Hey, it's snowing down here.

660
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:28,817
You see them?
There's got to be a million...

661
00:48:29,018 --> 00:48:30,508
...jellyfish down here.

662
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:33,678
Man, this is really beautiful.

663
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,392
These jellyfish are getting
a little friendly.

664
00:48:40,262 --> 00:48:42,093
Having a hard time seeing.

665
00:48:43,732 --> 00:48:47,190
Hey, guys, you getting this?
It's getting thick down here.

666
00:48:47,403 --> 00:48:48,927
Hello, hello.

667
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,440
I can't see what I'm doing.

668
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:58,672
They're sticking to my faceplate.

669
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:02,612
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding. Just
swim through them. They're harmless.

670
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:07,055
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.

671
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,255
Fletcher, get out of there.

672
00:49:10,459 --> 00:49:12,256
What are jellyfish doing at 1 ,000 feet?

673
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:14,986
I think they feel
the heat from my body.

674
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,260
l can't get them off me!

675
00:49:20,536 --> 00:49:22,595
They're stinging through my suit!

676
00:49:22,805 --> 00:49:24,670
Get back to the Habitat
on the double.

677
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,740
l can't move my legs!

678
00:49:29,378 --> 00:49:30,504
Come back to the Habitat.

679
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,743
They're inside my suit!

680
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:35,680
lKeep moving!
Just keep moving!

681
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:45,326
Help me!

682
00:50:21,263 --> 00:50:23,731
Jesus, Barnes, she's dead!
There's no bubbles.

683
00:50:33,175 --> 00:50:34,164
Edmunds.

684
00:50:34,376 --> 00:50:35,172
Yes, sir?

685
00:50:35,644 --> 00:50:37,202
Come on down here.

686
00:50:37,646 --> 00:50:38,840
Something...

687
00:50:39,048 --> 00:50:40,606
...happened to Fletcher.

688
00:51:10,145 --> 00:51:11,237
God!

689
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:17,075
When l was 5 years old
l went out on a boat with my father.

690
00:51:17,686 --> 00:51:21,383
He told me not to jump in the water,
so of course l did and....

691
00:51:24,259 --> 00:51:26,159
Oh, my!

692
00:51:26,729 --> 00:51:29,357
l jumped right into a school
of these guys.

693
00:51:29,565 --> 00:51:31,089
Not this big, though.

694
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:35,659
l think every one had a shot at me.
l don't know what this lady felt...

695
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:39,705
...but, man, it went beyond pain.
l've been...

696
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:41,969
...afraid of them since.

697
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:45,442
Would you feel any better if l told you
this wasn't exactly a jellyfish?

698
00:51:45,648 --> 00:51:46,376
You mean...?

699
00:51:47,383 --> 00:51:50,284
l mean, jellyfish like this
are unheard of.

700
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:54,055
l don't know what this is,
but it isn't God's creation.

701
00:52:06,769 --> 00:52:10,261
Here I am
Your special island

702
00:52:12,207 --> 00:52:14,038
Come to me

703
00:52:17,112 --> 00:52:18,773
Bali Ha'i

704
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:31,925
You can come in.

705
00:52:36,632 --> 00:52:39,260
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?

706
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:41,796
-No, thanks.
-How well do you know Dr. Halperin?

707
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:45,599
l used to teach at UC San Diego
years ago. She came for her master's.

708
00:52:45,808 --> 00:52:50,006
Don't take it personally, but l assume
she wasn't a romantic interest.

709
00:52:50,245 --> 00:52:51,542
Don't take what personally?

710
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,771
She's a tall, vibrant,
younger woman.

711
00:52:53,982 --> 00:52:54,971
What's your point?

712
00:52:55,184 --> 00:52:56,344
You knew her as a patient.

713
00:52:56,552 --> 00:52:59,146
l'm not at liberty to discuss that.
You understand.

714
00:52:59,354 --> 00:53:02,846
l understand an exotic-gas environment
1 ,000 feet under water...

715
00:53:03,092 --> 00:53:04,525
...with no lifeline to the surface...

716
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,661
...is about the most dangerous
environment on the planet.

717
00:53:07,863 --> 00:53:09,831
lf there's a problem,
l got to know about it.

718
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:12,560
-Beth is fine.
-''Beth is fine.''

719
00:53:12,968 --> 00:53:14,367
-Beth's fine.
-She's very fine.

720
00:53:14,603 --> 00:53:17,504
Would you like to read this
and tell me what it says?

721
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:19,697
-Are these my actual notes?
-What does it say?

722
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:22,638
-How in the world did you get--
-Does it say ''suicide attempt''?

723
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:25,712
''Electroshock therapy''?
lsn't that what it says?

724
00:53:25,948 --> 00:53:26,778
What's your point?

725
00:53:26,982 --> 00:53:29,348
Didn't it seem important enough
to tell somebody?

726
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:31,610
You were willing to jeopardize
these people's lives...

727
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,983
...to have someone here
who could be mentally unstable?

728
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,657
Are you aware of the term,
''overreact''?

729
00:53:36,859 --> 00:53:38,121
We're 1 60 fathoms down.

730
00:53:38,327 --> 00:53:41,262
And we've got a nutbag down here
who can flip out and crack up.

731
00:53:41,463 --> 00:53:43,624
You selected the team.
Why didn't you tell me?

732
00:53:43,832 --> 00:53:46,357
When l wrote this, l didn't know
the team would be 1 ,000--

733
00:53:46,568 --> 00:53:50,698
1 ,000 or 1 0, it makes no difference!
Why didn't you tell me about Beth?

734
00:53:50,906 --> 00:53:51,930
lt wasn't pertinent.

735
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,631
That was not your call to make!

736
00:53:53,842 --> 00:53:55,969
Yes, it was and it still is.
lt was a passive attempt.

737
00:53:56,178 --> 00:53:57,202
A passive attempt?!

738
00:53:57,412 --> 00:54:01,041
Those who really want to kill themselves
shoot themselves or go over a bridge.

739
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,811
They don't call their boyfriend and say,
''l just took 20 Nebutol. Help me.''

740
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,080
She took 20 yellows
and you're telling me she's perfect.

741
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,348
What is it?
Come in.

742
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:12,657
lt's Harry.

743
00:54:12,861 --> 00:54:14,055
What?
He's awake?

744
00:54:14,263 --> 00:54:15,252
He's really awake.

745
00:54:17,432 --> 00:54:19,332
Man, oh, man!

746
00:54:20,536 --> 00:54:22,060
You're going to have
a problem with me.

747
00:54:22,271 --> 00:54:25,434
lf my good buddy Norman keeps cooking
like this, l ain't going nowhere.

748
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:27,131
This toast is good.

749
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:29,643
Bacon? Better.

750
00:54:29,845 --> 00:54:34,009
But these eggs!
These eggs are fantastic!

751
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:36,944
Norman, what did you put
in these eggs?

752
00:54:37,286 --> 00:54:39,447
No, no, wait. Don't tell me.

753
00:54:41,723 --> 00:54:42,917
Parsley.

754
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:45,719
Chives.
Tarragon and....

755
00:54:46,295 --> 00:54:47,557
What is that?

756
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:49,920
Chervil?
ls that chervil?

757
00:54:50,132 --> 00:54:51,292
Yes, it is.

758
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,627
l'm glad you like it, Harry.

759
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:55,633
l love eggs!

760
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:59,163
They sure seem
to cheer you up.

761
00:54:59,374 --> 00:55:01,001
Do you remember what happened?

762
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,612
Yeah. l went inside.

763
00:55:04,813 --> 00:55:07,338
How did you get inside?
There are no doors.

764
00:55:07,783 --> 00:55:11,310
There are doors all over this place
and we can't get out.

765
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,454
-We're still here.
-Yes, we are.

766
00:55:13,655 --> 00:55:15,418
You didn't answer my question.

767
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,293
Why are you looking
at me like that?

768
00:55:21,663 --> 00:55:24,097
Harry, are you saying
we shouldn't still be here?

769
00:55:24,466 --> 00:55:26,934
Where's Teeny? l thought
she did all the cooking.

770
00:55:27,135 --> 00:55:30,434
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.

771
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:33,637
lKilled? How?

772
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,443
Jellyfish.

773
00:55:39,114 --> 00:55:40,604
Jellyfish?

774
00:55:41,149 --> 00:55:42,116
That's strange.

775
00:55:42,317 --> 00:55:43,944
Yes, it is strange, isn't it?

776
00:55:44,653 --> 00:55:45,881
Here you go, Harry.

777
00:55:47,356 --> 00:55:50,416
-Little onion rings. Look at that.
-lt's not onion rings.

778
00:55:50,659 --> 00:55:52,149
Good, though.

779
00:55:52,527 --> 00:55:53,721
Guess what it is.

780
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:54,894
Calamari!

781
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:00,725
You all right?

782
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:04,099
Cough, cough, cough.

783
00:56:04,806 --> 00:56:07,400
-No, you're doing it wrong.
-l know what l'm doing.

784
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:08,576
Bring it up.

785
00:56:09,678 --> 00:56:10,736
Come on, bring it up.

786
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,044
He's trying to say something.
He's trying to talk.

787
00:56:15,684 --> 00:56:17,982
You don't listen.
He wants to say something!

788
00:56:18,954 --> 00:56:21,354
-l'm not choking, you asshole!
-See?

789
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:22,989
l hate squid.

790
00:56:25,494 --> 00:56:27,086
l hate squid.

791
00:56:30,065 --> 00:56:31,498
l'm sorry.

792
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:33,291
l was trying to help.

793
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:40,241
You okay?

794
00:56:42,678 --> 00:56:44,509
Harry, let me ask you something.

795
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,382
Before you went in the Sphere,
you were convinced we would die here.

796
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:52,219
Yeah, l remember that.

797
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:56,185
You still believe it?

798
00:57:00,028 --> 00:57:02,292
You afraid of dying, Norman?

799
00:57:25,554 --> 00:57:28,045
Bullshit! He's hiding something
and you know it.

800
00:57:28,256 --> 00:57:31,282
He went inside the Sphere and whatever
it is he saw, he won't tell us.

801
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:34,257
-He said he doesn't remember anything.
-You bought that?

802
00:57:35,464 --> 00:57:37,455
The whole food thing
was all a diversion.

803
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:40,829
The guy's willing to put
all of our lives on the line...

804
00:57:41,036 --> 00:57:43,163
...because he doesn't want
to share information.

805
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:47,001
l can see it. He's making notes for a
book. He wants to win the Nobel Prize.

806
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:48,369
And you don't?

807
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:53,446
Norman, you've known me
since l was 1 7 years old.

808
00:57:53,648 --> 00:57:55,673
l would love to be
the guy who gets--

809
00:57:55,884 --> 00:57:57,283
Do you know
how respected--

810
00:57:57,486 --> 00:58:02,480
l'm not! l've written one ''Fun With
Dick and Jane'' book on physics.

811
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:04,215
l mean, Niels Bohr...

812
00:58:04,426 --> 00:58:08,226
...he published ''The Quantum Theory
of Atomic Structure'' at 28.

813
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:12,059
Einstein, relativity, 26.
Newton, gravity, 23.

814
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:15,930
ln physics, if you haven't done it
by 35, chances are you never will.

815
00:58:16,138 --> 00:58:19,904
This doesn't have anything to do
with your competitiveness with Harry?

816
00:58:20,742 --> 00:58:22,232
1 9. Wunderkind!

817
00:58:22,444 --> 00:58:23,843
l rest my case.

818
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:25,971
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.

819
00:58:26,181 --> 00:58:26,943
Why?

820
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:29,208
Something's wrong
with the computer system.

821
00:58:38,527 --> 00:58:41,690
-Try purging it.
-l tried. lt just keeps coming back.

822
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:43,455
Discharge from the buffer memory?

823
00:58:43,665 --> 00:58:45,599
l ruled that out.

824
00:58:46,268 --> 00:58:49,499
The helium is getting to the chips.
lt's probably a saturation effect.

825
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:53,071
-lf that's true, what are our options?
-You have to change all the chips.

826
00:58:53,275 --> 00:58:56,608
Forget it. Run this place on manual?
lt's going to be a long 4 days.

827
00:58:56,812 --> 00:58:58,211
Hey, boss.

828
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:02,475
-Figured that out yet?
-lt's a saturation effect.

829
00:59:02,717 --> 00:59:06,881
l don't think so. lf it's a saturation
effect, it would be random.

830
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:08,548
What do you mean?

831
00:59:08,824 --> 00:59:10,951
This has a pattern.

832
00:59:19,067 --> 00:59:20,796
See? lt's like a code.

833
00:59:21,002 --> 00:59:22,299
A code from where?

834
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:25,628
How'd you do that?

835
00:59:25,841 --> 00:59:26,773
How'd you see that?

836
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:28,237
Try binary.

837
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:37,578
See? Letter breaks.

838
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:50,264
You think this is coming
from the Sphere?

839
00:59:50,532 --> 00:59:51,624
Don't know.

840
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:56,365
This mission is ultra top-secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.

841
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:01,099
lf you were it,
how would you know our alphabet?

842
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:03,607
Same way it's configured on a keyboard.

843
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:07,213
But reflected in an orb,
spherically.

844
01:00:07,782 --> 01:00:10,148
A keyboard, but spherical.

845
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:12,143
Take a keyboard...

846
01:00:12,354 --> 01:00:13,787
...wrap it around a sphere...

847
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,787
...then starting at the center key, G,
number the letters...

848
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:18,960
...spiraling out.

849
01:00:19,628 --> 01:00:21,789
-You the man!
-l still got it.

850
01:00:21,997 --> 01:00:23,828
l still got the juice.

851
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:31,396
lKeyboard.

852
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:33,232
They let you keep those?

853
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:35,407
Here, you want them?

854
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:41,047
All we got to do now
is plug in the numbers.

855
01:01:07,275 --> 01:01:08,435
Friends...

856
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:13,746
...in the 8,000 years
of recorded history, this is a first.

857
01:01:13,949 --> 01:01:17,680
You're now on-line
with an alien intelligence.

858
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,218
You got to be kidding.
You must've messed up the translation.

859
01:01:21,423 --> 01:01:22,412
l don't think so.

860
01:01:22,624 --> 01:01:25,252
lf this is right,
this alien sounds like an idiot.

861
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,758
That's something to consider.
A stupid alien. They must have them.

862
01:01:30,098 --> 01:01:34,558
l will admit the message is childlike,
but actually it's quite perfect.

863
01:01:34,769 --> 01:01:37,067
lt's short, to the point,
non-threatening...

864
01:01:37,272 --> 01:01:40,036
...kind of the way you talk
to a small child or a dog.

865
01:01:42,477 --> 01:01:43,876
Look at this.

866
01:01:45,213 --> 01:01:47,204
He's making a speech.

867
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,127
Ask him for his last name.

868
01:02:00,328 --> 01:02:01,295
What?

869
01:02:01,496 --> 01:02:03,896
l want a full name for my report.

870
01:02:04,499 --> 01:02:08,128
l'm not putting in my report l lost
a crew member on a deepsat expedition...

871
01:02:08,336 --> 01:02:09,826
...to find an alien named Jerry.

872
01:02:10,038 --> 01:02:11,096
Please! ''Jerry''?

873
01:02:11,306 --> 01:02:13,638
We ought to tell him
that we're enjoying it too.

874
01:02:13,842 --> 01:02:15,571
Ask him where he's from.

875
01:02:17,445 --> 01:02:19,913
Where are you from?

876
01:02:26,354 --> 01:02:29,812
''l make a journey. You make a journey.
We make a journey together.''

877
01:02:30,025 --> 01:02:32,858
l think Jerry's channeling
Deepak Chopra.

878
01:02:33,828 --> 01:02:35,523
A journey from where?

879
01:02:49,878 --> 01:02:51,106
He's happy.

880
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,669
He's crafty.

881
01:02:56,351 --> 01:02:57,340
What happened?

882
01:02:58,019 --> 01:02:59,714
Damn, l think we lost him.

883
01:03:01,389 --> 01:03:02,879
We're not alone.

884
01:03:03,858 --> 01:03:05,621
We are definitely...

885
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:07,226
...not alone.

886
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:10,062
lt's trying to make contact with us.

887
01:03:10,565 --> 01:03:15,059
Whatever it is, it was inside
that Sphere. Now it's out, free to act.

888
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:16,395
What do you mean by that?

889
01:03:16,638 --> 01:03:18,503
Free to take over our computers...

890
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:22,165
...call us on the phone,
come knock on the door if it wants to.

891
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:24,573
A physical presence.

892
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:26,344
What are you thinking about?

893
01:03:26,548 --> 01:03:28,209
That last part where he said,
''l am happy.''

894
01:03:28,416 --> 01:03:30,384
Don't you want Jerry to be happy?

895
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:32,050
Honestly?

896
01:03:32,253 --> 01:03:33,242
What's on your mind?

897
01:03:33,488 --> 01:03:36,685
l would be happy if Jerry
had no emotions whatsoever.

898
01:03:36,891 --> 01:03:39,382
Because the thing of it is,
here's Jerry...

899
01:03:39,594 --> 01:03:44,588
...an emotional being, cooped up
for 300 years with no one to talk to...

900
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:47,495
...none of the socialization,
the emotional growth...

901
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:50,330
...that comes from contact
with other emotional beings....

902
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:52,070
So?

903
01:03:52,941 --> 01:03:55,409
What happens if Jerry gets mad?

904
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:16,962
What is that sound?

905
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:18,597
Did you hear it?

906
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:20,860
You hear that thump?

907
01:04:21,136 --> 01:04:22,433
What is that sound?

908
01:04:23,471 --> 01:04:26,565
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?

909
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:29,242
You are a hell of a woman.

910
01:04:29,444 --> 01:04:32,311
l wish l knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were--

911
01:04:32,547 --> 01:04:34,981
Norman told you what?

912
01:04:36,651 --> 01:04:40,587
Let's put it this way,
that if Jerry could read your mind...

913
01:04:40,822 --> 01:04:42,983
...he'd be bored with ours.

914
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:47,994
What is that sound?

915
01:04:48,763 --> 01:04:50,287
Can you hear me?

916
01:04:53,401 --> 01:04:54,766
This is Norman.

917
01:04:54,969 --> 01:04:59,065
l get no answer from Edmunds and there's
strange noises. Something's going on.

918
01:05:10,685 --> 01:05:14,348
It looks like Edmunds is up
on the side of the Habitat.

919
01:05:16,825 --> 01:05:20,625
I'm not getting anything on sonar,
but watch yourselves out there.

920
01:05:34,876 --> 01:05:36,935
Would you hit your callback buttons,
please?

921
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:39,441
What'd you tell Barnes?

922
01:05:40,048 --> 01:05:41,208
About what?

923
01:05:41,883 --> 01:05:43,214
About me.

924
01:05:44,552 --> 01:05:48,318
You told him l took 20 Nebutol
and tried to kill myself.

925
01:05:48,523 --> 01:05:49,512
Didn't you?

926
01:05:49,791 --> 01:05:51,850
He had my notes.
What do you want me to do?

927
01:05:53,895 --> 01:05:56,329
Did you tell him who l called?

928
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:04,699
Oh, God.

929
01:06:14,749 --> 01:06:16,046
Come in.

930
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:38,331
Did you guys find that thumping yet?

931
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:12,472
l don't get it.
What could've done this to her?

932
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,111
My God!

933
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:24,880
She's like a rag doll.

934
01:07:26,154 --> 01:07:28,622
Her body's been completely pulverized.

935
01:07:28,823 --> 01:07:29,983
My God.

936
01:07:32,627 --> 01:07:36,154
''--tentacles 27 feet long.
That would make a formidable monster.''

937
01:07:41,069 --> 01:07:43,629
Let's go. Come on.
What?

938
01:07:46,741 --> 01:07:48,003
What is that?

939
01:07:51,913 --> 01:07:53,312
What does this mean?

940
01:07:54,015 --> 01:07:55,380
Talk to me.

941
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:57,312
What does this mean, Beth?

942
01:07:57,518 --> 01:07:59,645
There's something up there!

943
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:02,954
Guys, l'm getting
a reading on the sonar.

944
01:08:04,425 --> 01:08:05,756
You're not alone out there.

945
01:08:06,027 --> 01:08:09,588
What the hell makes eggs this size?!
Come on! Jesus, let's go!

946
01:08:09,797 --> 01:08:11,094
All right!

947
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:18,330
Norman, let's go.
Come on. Let's go!

948
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:24,168
What the hell is going on?

949
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:28,639
lt's 80 yards and closing.

950
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:30,215
Get out of there.

951
01:08:32,787 --> 01:08:33,776
What the hell?

952
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,980
What the hell is it?!

953
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:39,819
Come on, Norman!
Come on, let's go!

954
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:42,159
60 yards. How close are you?

955
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:46,223
What is it?

956
01:08:47,368 --> 01:08:49,199
What the hell is it?!

957
01:08:49,704 --> 01:08:51,535
40 yards. Move, move!

958
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:55,074
Come on. lt's something big!
Let's go!

959
01:08:55,843 --> 01:08:58,243
Where is it?
What is it?

960
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,507
20 yards! Move!

961
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,908
l need a report.

962
01:09:34,115 --> 01:09:37,278
l don't know what's going on out there.
There are eggs everywhere.

963
01:09:37,518 --> 01:09:39,213
You should've brought one back.

964
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,753
l wasn't up for an Easter egg hunt.
Maybe that's what Edmunds was doing.

965
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:45,454
l want to talk to Jerry.

966
01:09:52,544 --> 01:09:55,479
lf we're going to talk to this thing,
we got to have a game plan.

967
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,942
Specific.

968
01:09:57,148 --> 01:10:00,140
We have to have an objective.
We have to know what we're addressing.

969
01:10:04,189 --> 01:10:05,213
Jesus.

970
01:10:14,065 --> 01:10:15,123
Can you hear me?

971
01:10:17,869 --> 01:10:20,167
You've heard everything
we've talked about.

972
01:10:21,406 --> 01:10:22,703
That's great.

973
01:10:25,243 --> 01:10:26,369
This is Ted here.

974
01:10:28,346 --> 01:10:31,315
l'm the guy who decoded
the keyboard thing that you--

975
01:10:31,883 --> 01:10:33,145
Shut up!

976
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:35,683
Tell him we need to discuss this alone.

977
01:10:38,823 --> 01:10:39,619
Jerry, use your words.

978
01:10:41,326 --> 01:10:42,691
He's mad.

979
01:10:42,894 --> 01:10:45,362
-Use your words.
-Let's just pull the plug.

980
01:10:45,563 --> 01:10:46,928
lt may not be that simple.

981
01:10:47,132 --> 01:10:49,999
lt's that easy. We leave him alone,
he leaves us alone.

982
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:52,396
Maybe he doesn't want to be left alone.

983
01:10:52,604 --> 01:10:57,871
He's been down here in isolation
for 300 years. Maybe Jerry's lonely.

984
01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:04,671
What's that?

985
01:11:06,318 --> 01:11:09,048
lt's our sonar picking up
something outside.

986
01:11:11,556 --> 01:11:14,582
Jerry, we all think
that you're a fascinating...

987
01:11:14,793 --> 01:11:15,919
...and wonderful entity...

988
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:19,961
...and wish to talk to you for hours.
You know that, don't you?

989
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,030
ln your great understanding
and wisdom...

990
01:11:24,235 --> 01:11:27,204
...you must know that
entities such as ourselves...

991
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,307
...need to be private.
We have to talk alone sometime.

992
01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:35,777
You know what it is?

993
01:11:41,052 --> 01:11:42,041
Where'd he go?

994
01:11:42,253 --> 01:11:43,413
Shit!

995
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:49,154
Something's clogging everything up
out there.

996
01:11:57,268 --> 01:11:58,496
lt's back.

997
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:02,502
Positive thermals
on the in-line perimeter.

998
01:12:05,944 --> 01:12:06,933
What's that?

999
01:12:07,812 --> 01:12:09,404
Something is hitting the sensor grid.

1000
01:12:09,848 --> 01:12:10,974
Do we have any defenses?

1001
01:12:11,349 --> 01:12:14,614
We can run a high-voltage current
on the skin of the Habitat.

1002
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:17,014
But every time we try it,
we start an electrical fire.

1003
01:12:17,222 --> 01:12:20,953
Peripheral sensor's activated. l'll try
to image it on the fast-acting sonar.

1004
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:22,648
Building an image.

1005
01:12:23,194 --> 01:12:24,991
80 yards, closing fast.

1006
01:12:25,697 --> 01:12:27,824
Jesus Christ, it's 40 feet long.

1007
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:29,155
50 yards.

1008
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:30,459
Re-imaging.

1009
01:12:30,668 --> 01:12:32,829
That's the same image l saw
when you were looking for Edmunds.

1010
01:12:33,671 --> 01:12:35,536
lt looks like a giant squid.

1011
01:12:35,774 --> 01:12:39,005
A squid the size of the entire Habitat?
There's no such animal.

1012
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,337
That may be, but that doesn't mean
it isn't here.

1013
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,678
Re-imaging.
30 yards.

1014
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:48,452
What the hell is going on?

1015
01:12:54,492 --> 01:12:57,689
Jerry, if you can hear me,
it's Norman.

1016
01:12:57,896 --> 01:13:00,160
lf we've made you angry....

1017
01:13:00,365 --> 01:13:01,491
We got a pressure drop.

1018
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:03,166
Go to the control room and wait for me!

1019
01:13:03,368 --> 01:13:05,063
Just go, please!

1020
01:13:05,703 --> 01:13:06,931
Go! l'll tell you!

1021
01:13:07,772 --> 01:13:10,297
What's that sound?
What is that?

1022
01:13:10,575 --> 01:13:11,837
lt sounds like it's right above us.

1023
01:13:12,043 --> 01:13:15,240
l know where it is,
but what is it?

1024
01:13:47,879 --> 01:13:50,712
l'm in the control shaft!
We got a leak in here!

1025
01:13:50,915 --> 01:13:52,405
Hello?!

1026
01:14:04,395 --> 01:14:05,794
Holy shit!

1027
01:14:06,598 --> 01:14:07,622
Do you hear me?

1028
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:12,726
You got to increase the positive
air pressure and drive the water out.

1029
01:14:12,937 --> 01:14:16,270
lncrease the pressure?
Won't that use up our air supply?

1030
01:14:16,474 --> 01:14:19,568
lf the Habitat is full of water,
you'll be dead.

1031
01:14:19,777 --> 01:14:21,472
Open the red gate valve.

1032
01:14:23,948 --> 01:14:26,974
The pressure is dropping!
We'll be crushed like a tin can!

1033
01:14:27,385 --> 01:14:30,479
Find the red knob!
lt's the only one in the room!

1034
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:32,053
Got it!

1035
01:14:35,994 --> 01:14:37,052
Good.

1036
01:14:37,629 --> 01:14:39,392
We're getting positive pressure.

1037
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,467
Not too much.

1038
01:14:43,668 --> 01:14:45,226
Start to ease it back.

1039
01:14:57,815 --> 01:14:59,305
Turn it back!

1040
01:14:59,517 --> 01:15:01,576
The pressure is too high!

1041
01:15:01,953 --> 01:15:03,818
We'll explode!
Can you hear me?

1042
01:15:05,423 --> 01:15:06,856
Turn it back!

1043
01:15:18,803 --> 01:15:20,065
We're here!

1044
01:15:20,271 --> 01:15:21,067
Jesus!

1045
01:15:21,272 --> 01:15:22,170
Can you hear me?

1046
01:15:22,373 --> 01:15:23,704
l got him!

1047
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:27,177
Turn the red gate valve.

1048
01:15:27,378 --> 01:15:28,345
Which way?

1049
01:15:28,546 --> 01:15:29,706
Clockwise.
Close it.

1050
01:15:36,487 --> 01:15:37,545
Done!

1051
01:15:40,558 --> 01:15:41,855
We're still leaking!

1052
01:15:42,093 --> 01:15:44,493
lt's not the shell.
lt's the internal pipes.

1053
01:15:44,696 --> 01:15:45,788
We're okay.

1054
01:15:50,735 --> 01:15:51,895
What the hell is out there?!

1055
01:15:56,507 --> 01:15:57,667
Listen to me.

1056
01:15:57,875 --> 01:15:59,536
Whatever it is,
it's not letting go.

1057
01:15:59,744 --> 01:16:02,736
Pull the green lever marked
''high-voltage defense system.''

1058
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:05,973
He said it would start a fire!
Don't do it!

1059
01:16:06,184 --> 01:16:07,674
You said it would start a fire!

1060
01:16:07,885 --> 01:16:10,376
We're going to die down here.
Pull it.

1061
01:16:10,588 --> 01:16:11,919
Barnes, do you hear her?

1062
01:16:12,156 --> 01:16:14,556
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.
Pull the green lever.

1063
01:16:19,897 --> 01:16:21,228
Pull the lever!

1064
01:16:21,432 --> 01:16:24,162
He's trying to pull something!
Don't do it!

1065
01:16:24,369 --> 01:16:25,427
Do you hear her?!

1066
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:27,900
Don't listen to her.
Pull the goddamn lever!

1067
01:16:28,106 --> 01:16:30,267
Don't do it.
lf we start a fire...

1068
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:33,172
...it'll eat up all of our oxygen!

1069
01:16:33,411 --> 01:16:34,901
Don't do it!

1070
01:16:41,285 --> 01:16:44,516
We've got failures all over the place!
We're taking on water!

1071
01:16:44,722 --> 01:16:46,713
lt'll set a fire!
There's no way out!

1072
01:16:46,924 --> 01:16:48,892
Shut up!
What am l going to do?!

1073
01:16:49,727 --> 01:16:51,592
You're going to be squid food!
Pull it!

1074
01:16:51,796 --> 01:16:54,264
What am l going to do?
We're falling apart!

1075
01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:11,879
We're okay.

1076
01:17:13,117 --> 01:17:15,312
You don't have to be right all the time.

1077
01:17:18,556 --> 01:17:20,251
Anybody got some Advil?

1078
01:17:22,493 --> 01:17:24,120
We got a fire in the comm room.

1079
01:17:24,328 --> 01:17:27,525
Get up there. l'll meet you
with gas masks, in case we need them.

1080
01:17:43,414 --> 01:17:44,346
Extinguishers?!

1081
01:17:44,549 --> 01:17:45,846
There's one there.

1082
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:47,074
l got it!

1083
01:17:47,952 --> 01:17:50,477
-How do you work it?
-Pull the pin.

1084
01:17:55,626 --> 01:17:57,116
Are there any more?

1085
01:17:57,328 --> 01:17:58,352
ln the dorm.

1086
01:18:06,904 --> 01:18:09,805
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1087
01:18:11,175 --> 01:18:13,200
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors secured.

1088
01:18:14,345 --> 01:18:17,371
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1089
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,114
Wake up!

1090
01:18:27,425 --> 01:18:28,824
What are you doing?

1091
01:18:29,026 --> 01:18:30,653
Harry, wake up!

1092
01:18:31,195 --> 01:18:32,321
Shit!

1093
01:18:58,756 --> 01:19:01,748
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1094
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,359
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1095
01:19:06,564 --> 01:19:07,758
Doors secured.

1096
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:14,202
lt's coming through the ceiling panels.
Try to get it through the cafeteria!

1097
01:19:14,405 --> 01:19:17,067
Okay, l'm going up.
Get back!

1098
01:19:31,389 --> 01:19:32,788
Don't, Jerry!
Don't.

1099
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:47,266
You okay?

1100
01:19:47,471 --> 01:19:48,335
Hang on!

1101
01:19:54,412 --> 01:19:55,640
Get out!

1102
01:20:11,762 --> 01:20:12,990
Get out!

1103
01:21:13,824 --> 01:21:15,815
This is Norman, Jerry.
Can you hear me?

1104
01:21:18,496 --> 01:21:21,226
lt's Norman.
ls that you, Jerry?

1105
01:21:21,832 --> 01:21:23,823
Who put out the fire?

1106
01:21:25,169 --> 01:21:27,103
Who put the fire out?

1107
01:21:33,611 --> 01:21:36,546
He's dead. Barnes is dead.
He got cut in half by the door.

1108
01:21:36,747 --> 01:21:38,715
Beth and l put him
in a body bag.

1109
01:21:41,552 --> 01:21:44,043
l know. Something
happened to Ted, Jerry.

1110
01:21:46,524 --> 01:21:47,855
l can't.

1111
01:21:51,062 --> 01:21:52,757
lt's not in my power.

1112
01:21:54,966 --> 01:21:56,763
There was a fire and....

1113
01:22:00,204 --> 01:22:01,865
And l froze.

1114
01:22:03,941 --> 01:22:05,465
l didn't help him.

1115
01:22:07,445 --> 01:22:09,936
l wanted to,
but l didn't help him.

1116
01:22:14,585 --> 01:22:17,986
l knew him since he was 1 7 years old
and l let him go.

1117
01:22:18,189 --> 01:22:20,953
But l'd like to just deal with this
at a later time.

1118
01:22:27,231 --> 01:22:28,892
You made that, Jerry?

1119
01:22:36,974 --> 01:22:38,441
No, that's all right.

1120
01:22:40,578 --> 01:22:42,705
Very important. Nothing more
right now. Please.

1121
01:22:44,515 --> 01:22:45,539
You have to stop.

1122
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,047
Listen to me.

1123
01:22:47,251 --> 01:22:49,412
This is critical.

1124
01:22:54,925 --> 01:22:57,917
Your manifestations injure our entities.

1125
01:22:58,129 --> 01:23:01,462
And pretty soon there'll be
no more entities left to play with...

1126
01:23:01,665 --> 01:23:04,293
...and you'll be all alone again...

1127
01:23:04,502 --> 01:23:06,800
...because you can't control yourself.

1128
01:23:07,004 --> 01:23:11,941
Because with all your power, you
don't have the power to stop, do you?

1129
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:21,474
What name do you want?

1130
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,846
What name do you want?

1131
01:23:53,717 --> 01:23:55,480
Hi, Harry.
How you doing?

1132
01:23:58,155 --> 01:23:59,486
Can you believe what happened?

1133
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:00,679
What?

1134
01:24:00,891 --> 01:24:03,325
You know, the attack on the Habitat.

1135
01:24:05,563 --> 01:24:07,997
You know there was an attack
on this place?

1136
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:11,398
l must've slept through it.

1137
01:24:11,902 --> 01:24:14,894
-You slept through it.
-l was dead tired.

1138
01:24:18,409 --> 01:24:20,070
Smoke didn't bother you?

1139
01:24:21,078 --> 01:24:22,670
All the leaking?

1140
01:24:23,347 --> 01:24:26,612
You ever read this book,
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea ?

1141
01:24:26,851 --> 01:24:30,582
l found it in the john.
Someone's misguided attempt at levity.

1142
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:33,113
l always loved this book.

1143
01:24:33,357 --> 01:24:36,224
Could never get past page 87 though.
Too scary.

1144
01:24:36,427 --> 01:24:38,918
You seem strangely detached,
given our predicament.

1145
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,923
l don't know, Norman.

1146
01:24:41,799 --> 01:24:44,597
With all your running around,
what have you accomplished?

1147
01:24:44,802 --> 01:24:46,929
You knew l was running around?

1148
01:24:49,607 --> 01:24:51,700
Have you seen Beth?

1149
01:24:51,909 --> 01:24:53,774
No. Thought she's
with the others.

1150
01:24:54,145 --> 01:24:57,205
What others?
Barnes and Ted are dead, Harry.

1151
01:24:58,215 --> 01:25:01,878
There's nobody left down here
that knows how to run the place.

1152
01:25:02,153 --> 01:25:03,313
Right?

1153
01:25:03,787 --> 01:25:06,255
The fire screwed up the electronics.

1154
01:25:07,258 --> 01:25:08,816
We've used up...

1155
01:25:09,059 --> 01:25:11,289
...most of our reserve gas.

1156
01:25:12,897 --> 01:25:14,455
You're reading your book.

1157
01:25:19,803 --> 01:25:21,634
Somebody has to go reset the mini-sub.

1158
01:25:21,839 --> 01:25:25,070
lf you don't reset it every 1 2 hours,
it'll float to the surface.

1159
01:25:25,809 --> 01:25:26,798
l'll go.

1160
01:25:27,778 --> 01:25:29,643
-l'll go.
-You sure?

1161
01:25:30,648 --> 01:25:32,809
lf the storm clears...

1162
01:25:33,017 --> 01:25:34,985
...it might be our only way out.

1163
01:25:35,186 --> 01:25:37,120
Can l talk to you for a second?

1164
01:25:38,856 --> 01:25:41,256
l don't want Harry anywhere near
that mini-sub.

1165
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:42,686
Think he'll leave without us?

1166
01:25:42,927 --> 01:25:46,454
l think he already left without us.
Harry's in a whole other place.

1167
01:25:46,664 --> 01:25:51,260
He slept through the attack.
You don't find that a little strange?

1168
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,829
l guess it's just you and me, babe.

1169
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:57,602
You and me?

1170
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:01,303
l'll keep my eye on you
from the control room.

1171
01:26:29,373 --> 01:26:30,704
Reset.

1172
01:26:31,475 --> 01:26:33,340
Reset, where are you?

1173
01:26:34,144 --> 01:26:35,202
There you are.

1174
01:26:55,866 --> 01:26:58,334
Are there supposed to be bubbles...

1175
01:26:58,669 --> 01:27:00,261
...coming out of...

1176
01:27:01,405 --> 01:27:02,872
...out of here too?

1177
01:27:06,744 --> 01:27:09,679
l think l have bubbles coming out
of my hose or something.

1178
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:16,913
Can you tell me what to do?
lt's fogging me all up here.

1179
01:27:19,089 --> 01:27:20,886
There's something wrong here!

1180
01:27:21,091 --> 01:27:24,219
I got to get out of here! Tell me
what to do! What do I push?

1181
01:27:24,428 --> 01:27:25,759
Where the hell are you?

1182
01:27:25,963 --> 01:27:27,225
Help me.

1183
01:27:32,036 --> 01:27:34,698
I don't think I'll ever get back!

1184
01:27:40,778 --> 01:27:42,109
Tell me what to do!

1185
01:27:43,881 --> 01:27:45,280
l can't breathe!

1186
01:27:45,482 --> 01:27:47,450
Watch out for that rock.

1187
01:27:47,985 --> 01:27:51,284
lt's me, Harry.
Come around the rock.

1188
01:27:51,488 --> 01:27:53,786
Go to the right of the stanchion.

1189
01:27:53,991 --> 01:27:55,925
Tell me what to do.
l'm hurting.

1190
01:27:56,427 --> 01:27:58,258
Come around which way?

1191
01:27:59,263 --> 01:28:00,594
l can't breathe!

1192
01:28:00,931 --> 01:28:02,523
Yes, you can breathe.

1193
01:28:02,733 --> 01:28:06,191
lt's just a faulty valve. lt won't
kill you. You got plenty of gas.

1194
01:28:06,403 --> 01:28:07,870
I can't tell which way I'm going!

1195
01:28:08,072 --> 01:28:10,506
See the air lock?
Right in front of you.

1196
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:14,374
I can't bear the feeling in my ears!

1197
01:28:14,578 --> 01:28:16,068
And l can't breathe.

1198
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,433
-Where is she?
-Slow your breathing.

1199
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:46,131
-You'll hyperventilate.
-She said she'd keep an eye out for me.

1200
01:28:46,343 --> 01:28:49,506
l looked all over the Habitat for her.
l thought she was with you.

1201
01:28:52,116 --> 01:28:53,515
Where is she?

1202
01:28:54,151 --> 01:28:55,175
Where is she?!

1203
01:29:05,162 --> 01:29:07,153
Did she tell you she was going out?

1204
01:29:10,267 --> 01:29:11,666
I can't hear you.

1205
01:29:11,869 --> 01:29:13,496
lf she can't hear,
why'd she answer?

1206
01:29:13,704 --> 01:29:14,830
What are you doing?

1207
01:29:15,038 --> 01:29:17,632
I went looking for food.
We're out of food.

1208
01:29:18,308 --> 01:29:21,641
l was just up there. Stuff all over,
but there's plenty of food.

1209
01:29:21,845 --> 01:29:25,337
You went to look for food in the
spacecraft. That seems a little odd.

1210
01:29:25,549 --> 01:29:27,141
No. What seems odd about it?

1211
01:29:27,818 --> 01:29:31,117
Even if there was food,
wouldn't it be at least 300 years old?

1212
01:29:31,321 --> 01:29:33,949
I was hoping for a cryogenic freezer,
you know?

1213
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:36,023
Maybe a bottle of Bordeaux.

1214
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,051
She's lying.
She's lying about everything.

1215
01:29:39,763 --> 01:29:41,560
ls Harry up there with you?

1216
01:29:46,236 --> 01:29:49,694
Why don't we talk when you get back.
Meet me in the galley.

1217
01:29:49,907 --> 01:29:53,399
l'll buy you a cup of coffee.
There's still coffee, isn't there?

1218
01:29:53,677 --> 01:29:57,545
Very funny. I'll take mine black,
like my mood.

1219
01:29:57,748 --> 01:29:59,511
All right. See you soon.

1220
01:30:01,452 --> 01:30:05,548
We got 2 ingredients here:
Beth and this underwater environment.

1221
01:30:05,756 --> 01:30:09,021
Put them together,
you got one big-ass bomb.

1222
01:30:18,702 --> 01:30:20,431
How did it go in the mini-sub?

1223
01:30:20,871 --> 01:30:22,930
lt was a little disconcerting
out there, actually.

1224
01:30:24,608 --> 01:30:26,872
Weren't you supposed to be watching out
for me from the control room?

1225
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:28,577
Yeah, but...

1226
01:30:28,779 --> 01:30:32,943
...Harry said he'd take over for me.
You sat down at the monitors.

1227
01:30:35,486 --> 01:30:36,544
What happened?

1228
01:30:37,721 --> 01:30:39,052
l was in trouble.

1229
01:30:39,256 --> 01:30:40,245
Where were you?

1230
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,660
-What's going on?
-''What's going on?''

1231
01:30:45,963 --> 01:30:49,160
Going out to look for 300-year-old food
in that spaceship...

1232
01:30:49,399 --> 01:30:52,493
...when there's plenty of food here
isn't exactly normal.

1233
01:30:52,736 --> 01:30:53,964
''Plenty of food''?

1234
01:30:54,171 --> 01:30:56,071
There isn't any....

1235
01:31:02,346 --> 01:31:03,973
A veritable horn of plenty.

1236
01:31:16,593 --> 01:31:17,582
He must have hidden it.

1237
01:31:17,794 --> 01:31:19,819
You think l hid all that food?

1238
01:31:20,464 --> 01:31:21,829
l don't know what's going on.

1239
01:31:25,002 --> 01:31:26,367
l was standing right here.

1240
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:29,131
And there was no food
in the cupboards.

1241
01:31:32,142 --> 01:31:34,042
And there was no food
in the fridge.

1242
01:31:34,278 --> 01:31:38,305
Why would Harry do that?
Why would he set you up?

1243
01:31:38,515 --> 01:31:40,107
l don't know.

1244
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,044
You don't know?

1245
01:31:43,287 --> 01:31:44,652
l'm telling you...

1246
01:31:44,855 --> 01:31:46,720
...l was standing here...

1247
01:31:47,024 --> 01:31:48,889
...and this food was not here!

1248
01:31:49,126 --> 01:31:52,960
Calling Dr. Halperin. Dr. Beth
Halperin. Please return to reality.

1249
01:31:53,163 --> 01:31:54,528
Shut up.

1250
01:31:54,898 --> 01:31:56,695
You can see what he's doing to me.

1251
01:31:56,967 --> 01:31:58,832
You said you'd watch me.
You didn't.

1252
01:31:59,036 --> 01:32:00,867
You think Harry
said something he didn't...

1253
01:32:01,071 --> 01:32:02,834
...that cupboards are empty
when they're full.

1254
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,908
Clinically, we would call that
evidence of a psychotic break.

1255
01:32:07,144 --> 01:32:08,736
l am not crazy, Norman!

1256
01:32:09,646 --> 01:32:11,671
You going to write me a prescription?

1257
01:32:11,882 --> 01:32:16,080
And just get rid of me again?
lt's not that convenient down here!

1258
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,582
l am not psychotic!

1259
01:32:17,821 --> 01:32:19,152
How about a mini-psychotic break?!

1260
01:32:19,356 --> 01:32:20,482
That's not fair.

1261
01:32:20,691 --> 01:32:21,521
What?!

1262
01:32:21,725 --> 01:32:26,059
l'm down there. l can't breathe.
l'm hyperventilating. The man saved me.

1263
01:32:26,563 --> 01:32:27,655
Wait a minute!

1264
01:32:27,864 --> 01:32:30,492
You want me to believe
that he set you up! Why?

1265
01:32:30,701 --> 01:32:32,532
This isn't Alice In Wonderland !

1266
01:32:32,736 --> 01:32:34,704
Remember, ''just you and me, babe''?

1267
01:32:35,572 --> 01:32:38,063
ls it unrealistic to think
that at this point...

1268
01:32:38,275 --> 01:32:41,438
...you are a danger to yourself,
to all of us...

1269
01:32:41,678 --> 01:32:46,047
...because of your anger toward me,
which happened 1 0 or 1 5 years ago...

1270
01:32:46,249 --> 01:32:47,944
...which is so distorted
in your head!

1271
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:49,743
l was out there.

1272
01:32:49,953 --> 01:32:51,818
You almost got me killed!

1273
01:32:52,022 --> 01:32:55,719
The man tried to save my life!
You now want me to disbelieve Harry?!

1274
01:32:55,926 --> 01:32:59,191
Yes, l want you to disbelieve Harry!
l want you...

1275
01:32:59,396 --> 01:33:02,092
...to look at me
and believe for one time.

1276
01:33:04,534 --> 01:33:06,297
Look at me.
Am l telling you the truth?

1277
01:33:06,536 --> 01:33:07,764
You weren't there.

1278
01:33:09,272 --> 01:33:13,265
You want to believe Harry,
then that's fine.

1279
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:17,302
Because he's done everything but part
the sea for you since we've been here.

1280
01:33:19,082 --> 01:33:20,982
But l'm telling you...

1281
01:33:21,218 --> 01:33:22,810
...that he is not...

1282
01:33:23,053 --> 01:33:25,248
...telling you the truth.

1283
01:33:25,455 --> 01:33:26,752
This is not about Harry.

1284
01:33:28,091 --> 01:33:29,149
ls it?

1285
01:33:30,594 --> 01:33:32,084
Who's this about?

1286
01:33:34,297 --> 01:33:37,289
He didn't tell you what's
inside the Sphere, did he?

1287
01:33:38,402 --> 01:33:42,099
You didn't tell him
what's inside the Sphere.

1288
01:33:43,306 --> 01:33:45,467
And how would you know that?

1289
01:33:51,348 --> 01:33:52,440
Did you go inside?

1290
01:33:56,853 --> 01:33:59,185
Answer me.
Did you go inside the Sphere?

1291
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:05,628
Why won't you answer me?

1292
01:34:09,366 --> 01:34:10,458
lt's a question.

1293
01:34:10,667 --> 01:34:12,601
You don't want to talk to me.

1294
01:34:12,803 --> 01:34:13,997
Remember?

1295
01:34:15,338 --> 01:34:16,862
Answer a question.

1296
01:34:21,845 --> 01:34:23,312
What do you think?

1297
01:34:24,948 --> 01:34:26,973
You think she went in the Sphere?

1298
01:34:38,895 --> 01:34:40,055
Here.

1299
01:34:40,397 --> 01:34:42,126
You dropped your book.

1300
01:36:16,726 --> 01:36:18,318
What isn't Harry telling me?

1301
01:36:18,962 --> 01:36:21,396
l know you're there.
You're always there.

1302
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,268
What's inside the Sphere?

1303
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:29,161
Harry is reading this book...

1304
01:36:29,406 --> 01:36:31,237
... Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea .

1305
01:36:32,409 --> 01:36:35,105
What makes me nervous
is that after page...

1306
01:36:35,312 --> 01:36:36,973
...87...

1307
01:36:41,818 --> 01:36:43,809
...it's all blank pages.

1308
01:36:48,091 --> 01:36:49,251
Why?

1309
01:36:51,494 --> 01:36:53,655
Why did he go into the Sphere...

1310
01:36:57,133 --> 01:36:59,124
...and come out like this?
Why?

1311
01:36:59,336 --> 01:37:00,928
Why? Why, Jerry?

1312
01:37:01,137 --> 01:37:03,298
Why is this book half a book, Jerry?

1313
01:37:04,207 --> 01:37:05,469
Why? Why?

1314
01:37:05,675 --> 01:37:06,539
What's going on?

1315
01:37:12,849 --> 01:37:15,443
He's got G equals one.

1316
01:37:16,119 --> 01:37:17,518
That's right.

1317
01:37:18,288 --> 01:37:21,189
He's got B equals two.

1318
01:37:23,793 --> 01:37:24,953
He's got...

1319
01:37:25,161 --> 01:37:27,220
...H equals three.

1320
01:37:28,164 --> 01:37:29,529
That's not right.

1321
01:37:30,033 --> 01:37:32,092
Harry's got the code wrong.

1322
01:37:32,302 --> 01:37:34,634
H doesn't equal three.

1323
01:38:55,452 --> 01:38:58,819
Harry not only makes it real
for himself, Beth.

1324
01:38:59,055 --> 01:39:01,546
He makes it real for you.
He makes it real for me.

1325
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:04,191
He has made it real for everybody.

1326
01:39:04,494 --> 01:39:08,692
lt's really frightening because you
don't know whether it's really real...

1327
01:39:08,898 --> 01:39:13,494
...or whether he's made it real
for us to believe it's real.

1328
01:39:14,537 --> 01:39:16,528
And it's because of the Sphere.

1329
01:39:19,876 --> 01:39:21,867
Our Harry is Jerry?

1330
01:39:22,078 --> 01:39:24,808
Come on, l'm just as tired
as you are.

1331
01:39:25,482 --> 01:39:27,416
l know you can get this.
Okay?

1332
01:39:29,519 --> 01:39:34,582
Harry said he couldn't get past page 87
because he said it was too scary.

1333
01:39:34,858 --> 01:39:36,951
There's nothing on the pages.
Where's the rest?

1334
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,123
Read what's on page 87.

1335
01:39:40,463 --> 01:39:42,658
''According to calculations
of some naturalists...

1336
01:39:42,866 --> 01:39:47,326
...one of these animals, only 6 feet
long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.

1337
01:39:47,937 --> 01:39:50,030
That would make a formidable monster.''

1338
01:39:50,807 --> 01:39:52,468
What does Harry hate?

1339
01:39:52,942 --> 01:39:54,432
Squid.

1340
01:39:54,677 --> 01:39:56,770
And when he read that,
it scared him.

1341
01:39:57,614 --> 01:39:59,013
Getting the picture?

1342
01:39:59,449 --> 01:40:01,178
Remember all those...

1343
01:40:01,384 --> 01:40:03,181
...jellyfish that attacked?

1344
01:40:03,386 --> 01:40:05,183
What was Harry doing then?

1345
01:40:05,655 --> 01:40:06,644
Sleeping.

1346
01:40:06,856 --> 01:40:08,380
He was dreaming.

1347
01:40:09,793 --> 01:40:12,387
And this is the really wild part:

1348
01:40:12,996 --> 01:40:13,985
What he dreamed....

1349
01:40:14,197 --> 01:40:15,186
Happened?

1350
01:40:15,398 --> 01:40:16,956
lt happened.

1351
01:40:17,801 --> 01:40:20,133
You're telling me that...

1352
01:40:20,336 --> 01:40:24,739
...because Harry went inside the Sphere,
he now has the power to manifest...

1353
01:40:24,974 --> 01:40:27,841
...his dreams, his fantasies....

1354
01:40:28,044 --> 01:40:29,875
Manifest.
He manifested it.

1355
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,411
He made it happen.

1356
01:40:31,648 --> 01:40:33,047
We better not piss him off.

1357
01:40:33,249 --> 01:40:36,013
lt's not that different
from a child, right?

1358
01:40:36,219 --> 01:40:39,848
A child imagines that
what it's imagining happens.

1359
01:40:40,056 --> 01:40:41,216
But it doesn't.

1360
01:40:41,424 --> 01:40:43,221
But with Harry, it does.

1361
01:40:43,426 --> 01:40:47,055
ln fact, it's so real, it's not only
real to Harry, it's real to all of us.

1362
01:40:47,263 --> 01:40:50,255
And what l can't understand is that
ever since he went in the Sphere...

1363
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,127
...the Sphere has a power...

1364
01:40:52,335 --> 01:40:56,066
...that projects every subconscious
thought Harry has onto the computer.

1365
01:40:56,272 --> 01:40:58,740
lt prints it out
and we interact with it.

1366
01:40:58,942 --> 01:41:02,275
We thought it was Jerry.
lt's not Jerry. lt's Harry.

1367
01:41:02,512 --> 01:41:03,706
Harry's Jerry.

1368
01:41:03,913 --> 01:41:05,540
Does Harry know this?

1369
01:41:05,748 --> 01:41:08,546
But you went in the Sphere
and nothing happened.

1370
01:41:08,751 --> 01:41:10,912
Obviously, l didn't go in the Sphere.

1371
01:41:11,121 --> 01:41:15,524
You never went inside the Sphere?
You didn't go in there?

1372
01:41:16,593 --> 01:41:19,027
l was so angry at you.

1373
01:41:20,296 --> 01:41:22,457
l wanted you to be scared.

1374
01:41:23,399 --> 01:41:24,798
Maybe you had a right to be.

1375
01:41:25,468 --> 01:41:26,799
Thanks.

1376
01:41:28,071 --> 01:41:29,800
You sure you didn't go in there?

1377
01:41:32,408 --> 01:41:35,468
l don't know about you,
but l don't feel like dying down here.

1378
01:41:35,778 --> 01:41:38,110
What we're going to do
is find something to put Harry under.

1379
01:41:38,314 --> 01:41:41,442
We can put him in some
kind of deep unconscious sleep.

1380
01:41:41,651 --> 01:41:43,141
Dreamless sleep, l hope.

1381
01:41:43,386 --> 01:41:45,251
A dreamless sleep, yes.

1382
01:41:45,455 --> 01:41:46,945
How do we do that?

1383
01:41:47,223 --> 01:41:48,986
l got a bunch of drugs up there.

1384
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:51,020
Fancy that.

1385
01:41:51,227 --> 01:41:52,785
-''Diphenylpyraline.''
-Burns.

1386
01:41:52,996 --> 01:41:55,396
-''Ephedrine hydrochloride.''
-Motion sickness.

1387
01:41:55,598 --> 01:41:57,225
''Valdomet''?

1388
01:41:57,433 --> 01:42:00,061
-Ulcers. You might want to keep that.
-''Sintag.''

1389
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:03,728
Sintag is a synthetic opiate.
lt's a painkiller.

1390
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:05,407
l might want to keep that.

1391
01:42:05,608 --> 01:42:08,133
-What about ''parasolutrine''?
-Really?

1392
01:42:08,344 --> 01:42:11,245
l got paracin trichloride.
That's an anesthetic.

1393
01:42:11,447 --> 01:42:12,641
Do you combine it?

1394
01:42:12,849 --> 01:42:15,613
You give about 20 cc's of this one,
6 of this one.

1395
01:42:15,818 --> 01:42:16,807
You're in business.

1396
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,647
Here's some more paracin trichloride.

1397
01:42:18,855 --> 01:42:21,756
Good. We'll knock him out
for about 3 to 6 hours.

1398
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:36,167
l'm going to hold him.

1399
01:42:45,048 --> 01:42:46,037
What's going on?

1400
01:42:46,282 --> 01:42:47,510
Go back to sleep.

1401
01:42:53,056 --> 01:42:55,889
l didn't know
it would be that fast-acting.

1402
01:42:57,193 --> 01:42:58,751
We didn't kill him, did we?

1403
01:42:58,962 --> 01:43:00,520
l don't think so.

1404
01:43:03,366 --> 01:43:04,458
Okay.

1405
01:43:12,742 --> 01:43:14,676
Come on, come on.

1406
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:21,207
Here we go.

1407
01:43:25,922 --> 01:43:27,048
lt's a code.

1408
01:43:32,729 --> 01:43:34,663
How the hell are we supposed--

1409
01:43:34,864 --> 01:43:36,422
lt's decoding itself.

1410
01:43:38,434 --> 01:43:41,961
''Weather normal.
Surface support vessels return.''

1411
01:43:42,171 --> 01:43:44,935
6 hours and counting,
we're out of here.

1412
01:43:46,409 --> 01:43:47,740
lt's over.

1413
01:43:53,783 --> 01:43:55,444
lf you trust it.

1414
01:43:56,786 --> 01:43:59,050
You know me,
l believe everything.

1415
01:45:19,936 --> 01:45:21,028
Get out!

1416
01:45:21,437 --> 01:45:22,836
Get off!

1417
01:45:47,964 --> 01:45:49,659
They're Belcher sea snakes, Norman.

1418
01:45:49,866 --> 01:45:51,663
They're the most poisonous snakes
in the world.

1419
01:45:52,502 --> 01:45:55,027
But they're nocturnal.
They're only dangerous at night.

1420
01:46:06,916 --> 01:46:09,407
Norman, can you meet me
at the lab, please?

1421
01:46:09,652 --> 01:46:12,246
l have something
l need to show you.

1422
01:46:33,843 --> 01:46:35,174
What are you doing?
l'm here.

1423
01:46:36,846 --> 01:46:37,835
What are you doing?

1424
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:48,680
Why are you locking me in?

1425
01:47:00,703 --> 01:47:02,603
You manifested the snakes.

1426
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:05,334
Norman, up here.

1427
01:47:05,541 --> 01:47:08,840
You're the only one
who could be manifesting these snakes.

1428
01:47:09,045 --> 01:47:12,879
Turn around.
Turn around and look on the table.

1429
01:47:16,986 --> 01:47:18,044
See the hypodermic needle?

1430
01:47:19,288 --> 01:47:21,381
l want you to inject yourself.

1431
01:47:23,059 --> 01:47:24,219
lt's the same thing...

1432
01:47:24,427 --> 01:47:25,951
...that we used to inject Harry.

1433
01:47:26,162 --> 01:47:30,656
We gave Harry this stuff because
he was manifesting and we wanted to--

1434
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:33,391
You're manifesting your fears...

1435
01:47:33,836 --> 01:47:34,996
...the jellyfish...

1436
01:47:35,238 --> 01:47:36,796
...now the snakes.

1437
01:47:37,006 --> 01:47:39,497
The squid thing was Harry,
but he's asleep.

1438
01:47:39,775 --> 01:47:44,235
He's in a dreamless sleep. lt couldn't
be him. You are the only one left.

1439
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:48,516
What would the snakes have to do
with me? l didn't go in the Sphere.

1440
01:47:49,285 --> 01:47:50,616
See thejars?

1441
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:55,154
l put the snakes in there and they
disappeared in front of my eyes.

1442
01:47:55,358 --> 01:47:57,690
Who's manifesting them, Norman?

1443
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:59,149
You are.

1444
01:47:59,362 --> 01:48:00,954
I don't have anything
to do with snakes.

1445
01:48:01,163 --> 01:48:05,327
lf you don't use the hypodermic needle,
l'm going to have to defend myself.

1446
01:48:05,535 --> 01:48:07,400
I'd remember
if I went in the Sphere!

1447
01:48:07,603 --> 01:48:10,629
Don't make me do this.
l don't want to do this.

1448
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:12,000
I didn't manifest anything.

1449
01:48:12,208 --> 01:48:15,473
I didn't manifest the squid.
I didn't manifest the....

1450
01:48:15,678 --> 01:48:17,339
I shouldn't be talking
to you like this.

1451
01:48:19,382 --> 01:48:22,180
Why are you taking the gas out
of the room? That's my air.

1452
01:48:33,329 --> 01:48:35,354
What's with this water?!

1453
01:48:35,565 --> 01:48:39,194
Think it through. Whose childhood fears
were the jellyfish?

1454
01:48:39,402 --> 01:48:40,869
-Jellyfish?
-Remember, Norman?

1455
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:43,163
l'm not the only one
who's afraid of jellyfish.

1456
01:48:43,372 --> 01:48:44,999
This wasn't exactly a jellyfish.

1457
01:48:45,207 --> 01:48:46,674
Jellyfish like this are unheard of.

1458
01:48:46,876 --> 01:48:48,309
Anybody can be...

1459
01:48:49,512 --> 01:48:52,413
...afraid of jellyfish.
A lot of people are afraid of them.

1460
01:48:52,848 --> 01:48:56,409
lsn't it possible
that you went inside the Sphere...

1461
01:48:57,153 --> 01:48:58,882
...and you just don't remember?

1462
01:48:59,088 --> 01:49:02,251
l didn't go inside the Sphere!
You would've seen it on the video!

1463
01:49:03,426 --> 01:49:05,053
l didn't go inside the Sphere.

1464
01:49:05,261 --> 01:49:06,159
Yes, you did.

1465
01:49:06,362 --> 01:49:07,386
Is he alive?

1466
01:49:07,597 --> 01:49:08,689
You went inside the Sphere...

1467
01:49:08,898 --> 01:49:11,867
...and youjust don't remember.
That's the problem.

1468
01:49:16,072 --> 01:49:18,302
It's not me!
I'm not going to use it!

1469
01:49:18,507 --> 01:49:20,998
lnject yourself
with the hypodermic needle.

1470
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:29,077
lt's your snakes.
See?

1471
01:49:29,285 --> 01:49:30,946
lt's all a fear.
lt's just a fear.

1472
01:49:31,454 --> 01:49:34,582
You can make it go away.
Just use the hypodermic needle.

1473
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:37,953
And the ships will come
and we'll get out of here.

1474
01:49:39,428 --> 01:49:42,124
What are you doing?!
You're going to kill me!

1475
01:49:46,268 --> 01:49:47,462
You can stop it.

1476
01:49:49,438 --> 01:49:51,201
Try to pull yourself together.

1477
01:49:52,541 --> 01:49:54,600
Your fears are going to kill
all of us.

1478
01:50:08,924 --> 01:50:10,949
Please, don't open the hatch.

1479
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:13,560
You'll freeze to death in the water.

1480
01:50:17,967 --> 01:50:20,902
You'll kill yourself!
Don't open the hatch!

1481
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,831
I know enough
not to get killed down here.

1482
01:50:53,035 --> 01:50:55,230
Are you the most qualified
in your field?

1483
01:50:55,438 --> 01:50:56,632
What exactly are your qualifications?

1484
01:50:56,839 --> 01:50:57,897
Why are you here?

1485
01:50:58,107 --> 01:51:00,132
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

1486
01:51:02,878 --> 01:51:04,812
Are you the most qualified?

1487
01:51:05,014 --> 01:51:07,812
You almost got me killed.

1488
01:51:09,318 --> 01:51:10,683
You're a danger to all of us.

1489
01:51:11,987 --> 01:51:13,784
Come back to reality.

1490
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:39,990
What are you doing?

1491
01:54:08,063 --> 01:54:09,462
Are you real?

1492
01:54:15,371 --> 01:54:18,204
As real as the water
that almost drowned me.

1493
01:54:21,644 --> 01:54:23,373
You tried to kill me.

1494
01:54:27,716 --> 01:54:29,240
What are you doing there?

1495
01:54:33,589 --> 01:54:36,251
Beth, you went into the Sphere.

1496
01:54:39,995 --> 01:54:41,155
Didn't you?

1497
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,046
Answer me.

1498
01:55:06,255 --> 01:55:09,622
l don't know what to think.
l feel like l can't breathe.

1499
01:55:10,659 --> 01:55:12,752
l'm losing it, you know?

1500
01:55:13,562 --> 01:55:16,622
l'm trying to keep it together, but....

1501
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:19,131
What's going on?

1502
01:55:19,335 --> 01:55:20,893
Why'd you put me out?

1503
01:55:22,004 --> 01:55:24,097
What are you guys up to?

1504
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:26,301
You went in the Sphere, Harry.

1505
01:55:26,742 --> 01:55:28,004
So did Beth.

1506
01:55:28,477 --> 01:55:29,637
So did l.

1507
01:55:30,546 --> 01:55:31,376
l think.

1508
01:55:31,981 --> 01:55:33,812
And if so, what?

1509
01:55:34,249 --> 01:55:36,410
Everything that we feel or think...

1510
01:55:36,618 --> 01:55:37,607
...just...

1511
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:38,946
...happens.

1512
01:55:39,154 --> 01:55:41,384
That's what happened
to the astronauts.

1513
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:44,753
The astronaut in the chair,
what did you say about his head?

1514
01:55:45,327 --> 01:55:46,487
He had...

1515
01:55:46,996 --> 01:55:49,829
...blunt force trauma.
He got hit in the head.

1516
01:55:50,032 --> 01:55:51,897
They went into the Sphere one by one...

1517
01:55:52,101 --> 01:55:55,229
...became afraid of each other
till they killed each other off.

1518
01:55:55,437 --> 01:55:57,803
And we're doing the same thing.

1519
01:55:58,774 --> 01:56:00,469
l don't want to kill you.

1520
01:56:03,846 --> 01:56:05,575
Your attention, please.

1521
01:56:05,781 --> 01:56:09,273
All construction personnel
must exit the blast area...

1522
01:56:09,485 --> 01:56:10,509
...immediately.

1523
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:13,586
Panther explosives
are now activated.

1524
01:56:13,789 --> 01:56:16,485
Mark 13 minutes and counting.

1525
01:56:17,192 --> 01:56:18,989
Want to tell me who that voice is?

1526
01:56:19,795 --> 01:56:23,697
They had explosives down here
to blow up the coral.

1527
01:56:23,899 --> 01:56:28,836
So when l went out before, l set up a
defense perimeter around the spaceship.

1528
01:56:29,138 --> 01:56:30,628
Something must have triggered it.

1529
01:56:31,874 --> 01:56:33,705
Something from inside the Sphere.

1530
01:56:33,909 --> 01:56:37,868
-Nothing in the Sphere. You know that.
-Then what?

1531
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:39,176
l don't know.

1532
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:42,139
Then who?

1533
01:56:46,655 --> 01:56:47,986
lt's me.

1534
01:56:48,991 --> 01:56:50,481
Oh, God.

1535
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:53,961
l was just thinking
about the explosives.

1536
01:56:54,163 --> 01:56:57,564
lt just flashed inside my mind.
lt must've triggered them.

1537
01:57:03,739 --> 01:57:05,730
l was thinking about wanting to die.

1538
01:57:07,242 --> 01:57:09,437
You put explosives near the spacecraft?

1539
01:57:10,345 --> 01:57:11,744
Yeah, l did.

1540
01:57:13,248 --> 01:57:15,273
But they're about 1 00 yards away.

1541
01:57:15,918 --> 01:57:18,887
There's a lot of liquid hydrogen
left on that spacecraft.

1542
01:57:19,088 --> 01:57:21,386
lf it explodes,
it'll disintegrate everything.

1543
01:57:24,326 --> 01:57:26,260
Mini-sub, now!
Let's go!

1544
01:57:30,365 --> 01:57:32,526
l hope there's a ship up there.

1545
01:57:34,937 --> 01:57:36,199
Your attention, please.

1546
01:57:36,405 --> 01:57:41,342
All construction personnel must exit
the blast area immediately.

1547
01:57:41,543 --> 01:57:44,774
Panther explosives
are now activated.

1548
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:47,244
Mark 10 minutes and counting.

1549
01:57:59,294 --> 01:58:00,625
Let's go! Let's go!

1550
01:58:01,463 --> 01:58:02,555
Come on, come on!

1551
01:58:09,471 --> 01:58:10,904
Come on, move!

1552
01:58:11,106 --> 01:58:12,130
lKeep moving.

1553
01:58:12,975 --> 01:58:14,738
We're not going to make it!

1554
01:58:18,814 --> 01:58:21,112
There's not enough time.

1555
01:58:21,316 --> 01:58:22,647
Just keep moving.

1556
01:58:22,851 --> 01:58:26,082
We're not out of time. We're
not going to die here. lKeep moving.

1557
01:58:40,002 --> 01:58:41,697
Let's go, Norman.

1558
01:58:42,104 --> 01:58:44,265
lt's not like l drive subs, okay?

1559
01:58:44,473 --> 01:58:45,701
You're driving one now.

1560
01:58:49,678 --> 01:58:51,009
Oh, my God!

1561
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:53,011
What's going on?

1562
01:58:53,282 --> 01:58:54,271
l don't know.

1563
01:58:54,683 --> 01:58:56,173
Why are we inside the spaceship?

1564
01:58:56,385 --> 01:58:57,443
l don't know.

1565
01:58:58,787 --> 01:58:59,515
Let's go!

1566
01:59:00,022 --> 01:59:03,287
Now alert, alert.
5 minutes and counting.

1567
01:59:05,127 --> 01:59:07,789
We're not moving.
Anybody hit the button?

1568
01:59:09,364 --> 01:59:10,194
What the hell?

1569
01:59:12,034 --> 01:59:14,628
Wait a minute,
this was an elevator before, right?

1570
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:16,997
Which one of us is doing this?

1571
01:59:17,206 --> 01:59:18,138
Oh, God.

1572
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:21,268
Alert, alert.
Panther explosives armed.

1573
01:59:21,476 --> 01:59:23,376
Wait, wait.
We were here already!

1574
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,539
How much time we got?!
Come on!

1575
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:29,139
lt's a dead-end.

1576
01:59:29,384 --> 01:59:30,817
Where are we?

1577
01:59:31,220 --> 01:59:32,187
An illusion.

1578
01:59:32,387 --> 01:59:33,979
Doesn't look like it.

1579
01:59:34,556 --> 01:59:37,457
Beth, which way?
Harry, where do we go?

1580
01:59:37,659 --> 01:59:39,490
Where?
Where's where, Norman?

1581
01:59:39,695 --> 01:59:41,492
Around that corner?

1582
01:59:41,697 --> 01:59:42,959
And what's there?

1583
01:59:43,165 --> 01:59:46,794
Just another blind alley
in the maze of our minds. lllusion.

1584
01:59:47,002 --> 01:59:48,026
Maybe he's right.

1585
01:59:48,237 --> 01:59:50,228
We believe that,
we're dead.

1586
01:59:50,439 --> 01:59:52,304
Just go on. Leave me.

1587
01:59:52,507 --> 01:59:57,035
You're not going to die down here.
l'm not going to let you die. Come on.

1588
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:00,409
l'm not going to die.

1589
02:00:03,252 --> 02:00:04,913
You have to push the button.

1590
02:00:05,254 --> 02:00:06,380
l can't see a button.

1591
02:00:06,588 --> 02:00:07,714
l can't see the button.

1592
02:00:07,923 --> 02:00:09,185
l can't see the button.

1593
02:00:09,391 --> 02:00:10,915
lt's no use.

1594
02:00:11,193 --> 02:00:12,683
We die down here.

1595
02:00:13,862 --> 02:00:16,023
We're running out of time.
They all look the same.

1596
02:00:17,432 --> 02:00:19,366
l don't know where we are
or what we're stuck in.

1597
02:00:19,568 --> 02:00:22,765
Where we are is stuck in the illusion
that we can change the future.

1598
02:00:22,971 --> 02:00:24,268
lt's a dead-end.

1599
02:00:24,606 --> 02:00:26,870
Just like l said all along:

1600
02:00:27,442 --> 02:00:28,431
We die down here.

1601
02:00:28,644 --> 02:00:30,009
Maybe he's right.

1602
02:00:30,212 --> 02:00:31,509
Maybe he's right.

1603
02:00:31,713 --> 02:00:33,078
l'm not going to die.

1604
02:00:33,282 --> 02:00:34,374
Beth's not going to die.

1605
02:00:34,583 --> 02:00:36,073
And you're not going to die.

1606
02:00:36,285 --> 02:00:37,946
Look, just leave me.

1607
02:00:38,287 --> 02:00:42,246
We're not in the spacecraft!
We're in the mini-sub! This isn't real!

1608
02:00:42,457 --> 02:00:44,618
This is your manifestation!
Let it go!

1609
02:00:44,826 --> 02:00:45,520
lt's a dead-end.

1610
02:00:45,727 --> 02:00:47,285
We're not going to die here.

1611
02:00:47,496 --> 02:00:48,428
lt's not our time.

1612
02:01:06,481 --> 02:01:07,948
Thank God, we're out of here.

1613
02:01:08,150 --> 02:01:09,640
Don't start celebrating yet.

1614
02:01:09,851 --> 02:01:10,476
Why not?

1615
02:01:10,686 --> 02:01:12,415
l don't think
we're going fast enough.

1616
02:01:12,621 --> 02:01:13,610
For what?

1617
02:01:13,822 --> 02:01:16,950
An underwater blast creates a suction.
lt'll suck us into it.

1618
02:01:17,259 --> 02:01:19,318
That is, if the shock wave
doesn't kill us first.

1619
02:01:20,429 --> 02:01:23,830
Alert, alert.
Mark 20 seconds and counting.

1620
02:01:24,099 --> 02:01:26,431
Panther explosives are now activated.

1621
02:01:32,441 --> 02:01:34,136
640 feet.

1622
02:01:34,343 --> 02:01:35,105
630.

1623
02:01:35,844 --> 02:01:37,175
620.

1624
02:01:44,186 --> 02:01:46,313
61 0. You a religious man, Norman?

1625
02:01:46,521 --> 02:01:48,887
Atheist. But l'm flexible.

1626
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:20,688
Pull up, Norman! Pull up!

1627
02:02:24,726 --> 02:02:26,023
Come on, pull up!

1628
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:56,614
This is Escort 7.

1629
02:02:56,825 --> 02:03:00,261
We have sighted OSSA mini-sub,
bearing 105.

1630
02:03:00,462 --> 02:03:01,429
Repeat. Bearing 105.

1631
02:03:03,031 --> 02:03:05,761
Preparing to make contact
for decompression procedure.

1632
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:20,042
What's going on?

1633
02:03:20,282 --> 02:03:21,806
More of nothing.

1634
02:03:26,688 --> 02:03:29,555
l want to thank you for saving my life.

1635
02:03:30,892 --> 02:03:33,224
lnteresting life to save.

1636
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:39,267
You get some sleep.

1637
02:03:39,468 --> 02:03:42,631
l have no idea what to tell them
when they debrief us.

1638
02:03:54,082 --> 02:03:55,811
My back is killing me.

1639
02:03:56,318 --> 02:04:00,482
Next time l have to remember to stretch
before l jettison from a mini-sub.

1640
02:04:13,168 --> 02:04:15,830
We've been trapped in here
for about 3 days.

1641
02:04:16,104 --> 02:04:19,665
They want an explanation. We ought
to figure out what we want to tell them.

1642
02:04:20,175 --> 02:04:23,144
lKiller jellyfish, squid, sea snakes...

1643
02:04:23,345 --> 02:04:27,873
...and an alien being in the form
of a giant totemic golden ball? Please.

1644
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:33,514
We destroyed $ 1 00 million worth
of equipment down there and people died.

1645
02:04:34,356 --> 02:04:36,790
They want answers.
What do you guys want to tell them?

1646
02:04:38,527 --> 02:04:39,687
Why aren't we dead?

1647
02:04:40,028 --> 02:04:40,995
What?

1648
02:04:41,196 --> 02:04:42,128
You said:

1649
02:04:42,364 --> 02:04:44,195
''The future can't be changed.''

1650
02:04:45,033 --> 02:04:46,295
lt can't.

1651
02:04:46,635 --> 02:04:50,230
But in the spaceship they called it
an Unknown Entry Event.

1652
02:04:50,872 --> 02:04:54,569
Like we never got here alive
to tell them about it.

1653
02:04:55,143 --> 02:04:59,978
You said we wouldn't survive. lf you
can't change the future, we'd be dead.

1654
02:05:00,882 --> 02:05:02,645
We're alive.
We're not dead.

1655
02:05:04,753 --> 02:05:07,950
And in 2 minutes we'll be in a room
full of military guys.

1656
02:05:08,156 --> 02:05:09,953
They know about the Sphere.

1657
02:05:10,158 --> 02:05:14,288
We know Barnes got ahold of them
before we lost contact to the surface.

1658
02:05:14,496 --> 02:05:15,656
What do you want to tell them?

1659
02:05:16,398 --> 02:05:18,832
Why bother?
The Sphere's destroyed.

1660
02:05:19,034 --> 02:05:21,559
But we still have the power,
am l right?

1661
02:05:24,172 --> 02:05:27,369
l don't know if l trust them with it.
l don't know if l trust you.

1662
02:05:27,676 --> 02:05:31,874
l don't want to not be able to sleep,
afraid l'll wake up...

1663
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:34,310
...having manifested
some nightmare...

1664
02:05:34,516 --> 02:05:37,417
...and there's all kinds
of weird things in my apartment.

1665
02:05:37,752 --> 02:05:38,980
That's a frightening thought.

1666
02:05:39,187 --> 02:05:40,415
No kidding.

1667
02:05:41,590 --> 02:05:42,682
So...

1668
02:05:44,092 --> 02:05:45,855
...if we still have the power...

1669
02:05:47,195 --> 02:05:48,890
...what do you want to do with it?

1670
02:05:54,369 --> 02:05:56,098
God knows what they'll do with it.

1671
02:05:56,871 --> 02:06:00,864
Are you worried what will happen
if it falls into the wrong hands?

1672
02:06:01,076 --> 02:06:03,670
Yeah. Frankly, l don't know
what the wrong hands are.

1673
02:06:03,878 --> 02:06:06,506
Or what's worse:
the wrong hands or our hands.

1674
02:06:06,715 --> 02:06:08,512
We are the wrong hands.

1675
02:06:09,217 --> 02:06:10,616
We proved it.

1676
02:06:10,885 --> 02:06:15,515
You know, the 3 of us are enlightened
people, we're intelligent...

1677
02:06:15,724 --> 02:06:17,919
...we even recycle
our cans and bottles.

1678
02:06:18,226 --> 02:06:22,185
But when we got our shot,
we manifested every mean...

1679
02:06:22,397 --> 02:06:26,800
...distorting, vengeful,
paranoid thought you could think of.

1680
02:06:27,235 --> 02:06:28,429
We did.

1681
02:06:28,637 --> 02:06:29,296
Right?

1682
02:06:29,804 --> 02:06:31,635
You believe we still have the power.

1683
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:34,902
Of course we still have it.

1684
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:38,301
And that's the answer to the equation.

1685
02:06:38,913 --> 02:06:40,778
We can't change the future.

1686
02:06:40,982 --> 02:06:44,645
We're not dead.
But they don't know. Why?

1687
02:06:46,254 --> 02:06:47,346
l'm not following you.

1688
02:06:48,156 --> 02:06:50,989
Because we have the power...

1689
02:06:51,426 --> 02:06:52,916
...to forget.

1690
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:57,161
To forget.

1691
02:06:57,766 --> 02:06:59,734
You want us to agree to forget?

1692
02:06:59,934 --> 02:07:02,926
Wait a minute, are we sure
that we want to do this?

1693
02:07:03,138 --> 02:07:04,435
Yes.

1694
02:07:07,609 --> 02:07:10,134
This is the greatest discovery
in the history of mankind.

1695
02:07:10,345 --> 02:07:12,870
We're just going to white it out
like it's a typing error?

1696
02:07:14,349 --> 02:07:15,611
l'm sure.

1697
02:07:18,353 --> 02:07:19,786
What about you, Beth?

1698
02:07:20,622 --> 02:07:22,283
What's the matter, Norman?

1699
02:07:22,490 --> 02:07:24,583
lt's a little hard to let go of.

1700
02:07:24,793 --> 02:07:26,192
Something that could've been...

1701
02:07:27,162 --> 02:07:28,686
...this gift?

1702
02:07:29,130 --> 02:07:31,564
The power to make your dreams
come true.

1703
02:07:31,966 --> 02:07:34,958
We're given the greatest gift
in the history of mankind.

1704
02:07:35,370 --> 02:07:36,997
We're given this magic ball.

1705
02:07:37,205 --> 02:07:38,263
And it says:

1706
02:07:38,473 --> 02:07:42,876
''Imagine what you will
and you can have it. ''

1707
02:07:44,312 --> 02:07:47,713
That's an extraordinary gift,
but we're so primitive we....

1708
02:07:49,818 --> 02:07:53,015
We manifested the worst in us,
because what we have inside us...

1709
02:07:53,221 --> 02:07:57,681
...is what we have inside of us, instead
of the best of us. What does that say?

1710
02:08:00,228 --> 02:08:01,991
We weren't ready, Norman.

1711
02:08:03,164 --> 02:08:06,065
We have what's called an imagination.

1712
02:08:08,236 --> 02:08:11,467
l mean, look what we're capable of.

1713
02:08:11,673 --> 02:08:12,833
We can....

1714
02:08:18,913 --> 02:08:20,403
We're not ready.

1715
02:08:26,254 --> 02:08:27,915
A long time ago...

1716
02:08:29,257 --> 02:08:31,248
...l did something very...

1717
02:08:31,526 --> 02:08:34,518
...very inappropriate with you,
and l'm sorry.

1718
02:08:35,764 --> 02:08:36,731
Okay?

1719
02:08:36,931 --> 02:08:37,920
Okay.

1720
02:08:38,867 --> 02:08:43,065
l don't have any answers, Norman,
but these guys are coming so let's....

1721
02:08:43,538 --> 02:08:46,530
Okay, we're going to agree to forget...

1722
02:08:47,375 --> 02:08:48,535
...the Sphere...

1723
02:08:49,277 --> 02:08:50,437
...the power...

1724
02:08:51,212 --> 02:08:52,770
...all that ever was.

1725
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:02,587
l don't know how to get this going.
You're the mathematician.

1726
02:09:02,791 --> 02:09:04,383
How about we just count to 3?

1727
