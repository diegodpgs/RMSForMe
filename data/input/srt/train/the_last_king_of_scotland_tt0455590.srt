00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,600
<i>- Come on! Are youse ready?
- Aye! Aye!</i>

3
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,300
<i>On your marks!
Get set!</i>

4
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,800
Go!

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
Yeah!

6
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,500
Stew, Dr. Garrigan?

7
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,500
- And you, Dr. Garrigan?
- Hmm.

8
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
I, uh-

9
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,700
- I thought that-
- Mother.

10
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,900
<i>Seeing as we have something to celebrate,
we might have a wee drop.</i>

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,200
- Sherry.
- Right. Right.

12
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,000
Uh-huh. Your mother and I
are very proud of you, Nicholas.

13
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,100
- Very proud.
- Not quite as good a degree as mine...

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,300
but a fine one
nevertheless.

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,300
Being a family doctor-

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, let me tell you, Nicholas,
you've chosen a fine life.

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,000
If you'll both raise your glasses...

18
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,000
a toast.

19
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,000
To father and son.

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,300
A long future together.

21
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,000
<i>Nicholas, are you all right in there?</i>

22
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,100
I'm fine.

23
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm fine.

24
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,400
Okay. First place you land,
you go.

25
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,000
First place you land,
you go.

26
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Canada.

27
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>What are all the soldiers for?</i>

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,200
- Excuse me. Do you speak English?
- Yes.

29
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,600
What are all the soldiers for?

30
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,500
<i>The army's taking over.
There is a coup.</i>

31
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,500
<i>- A coup? What, are we safe?
- Don't worry.</i>

32
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,800
<i>These are General Amin's men.
He fights for the people.</i>

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
It's a very happy day
for us.

34
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,100
- Is that him?
- Yes.

35
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,100
<i>- What do you do in Scotland?
- Well, I'm a doctor.</i>

36
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,400
- A qualified doctor.
- Oh.

37
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah. I thought maybe
use my skills here, you know?

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,700
<i>Monkeys! Look! Look up there, Tolu. Look.</i>

39
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,000
Do you have monkeys
in Scotland?

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,500
No, we don't have monkeys in Scotland.

41
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,300
<i>No. If we had monkeys
in Scotland...</i>

42
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
<i>we'd probably
deep-fry them.</i>

43
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,300
I think
I'm gonna like it.

44
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,500
This is my stop.

45
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm a medical officer
overseas!

46
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,200
<i>Dr. Garrigan?</i>

47
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,200
- Uh, Dr. Merrit.
- No, I'm Sarah, David's wife.

48
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,100
- Welcome.
- Hello.

49
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,300
David was called out
on an emergency.

50
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,500
- I hope everything's okay.
- Yeah. Just normal business around here.

51
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Safe journey?

52
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,400
- Uh, well, you know, it was-
- Bloody awful.

53
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,300
Goat up your ass and your face
in someone's armpit.

54
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,100
Last time I did that trip,
I nearly asphyxiated.

55
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
Right. Hop in.

56
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,200
<i>Actually, I waited
for the bus yesterday too.</i>

57
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,300
- Oh, yeah?
- We were getting a little worried about you.

58
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,700
Thought you might have
got caught up in the coup.

59
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,500
It's official now, by the way.
Obote's out. Radio's full of it.

60
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,000
Who's Obote?

61
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,100
- Ex-president.
- Oh, right. And, uh, what's his name.

62
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,300
<i>Amin. He's taken over.
Yeah?</i>

63
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,800
<i>You've certainly come
at a busy time.</i>

64
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,600
Whatever I can do
to help.

65
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,500
<i>- Morning, Nicholas.
- Morning.</i>

66
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,300
- So, what do you think?
- Aye. Aye, fine.

67
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,100
Come on. Come through.

68
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,000
This is
the operating room.

69
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Simple procedures
for the most part.

70
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,900
- Ah, morning.
- Morning.

71
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,800
<i>If you don't mind me asking,
how many doctors are there here?</i>

72
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, there's me, and, uh-
and now there's you.

73
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,400
<i>- Good morning, Sister. Good morning.
- Morning.</i>

74
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,000
You know, the, uh,
interesting thing is...

75
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,100
80% of the locals still prefer
the witch doctor to us.

76
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,400
Sometimes I think we're just...
skimming the surface of an ocean.

77
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,200
- Ready?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,000
There we are.
Whoo.

79
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,200
- There we go. Okay.
- Over here. Okay.

80
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Yes, thank you.

81
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,100
And-

82
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,100
<i>Okay, and one more. Okay, who's next?</i>

83
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,100
That's a lovely name.
Can I just see your-

84
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Yeah?

85
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,400
Nicholas, are you ready?

86
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,400
Dr. Merrit.

87
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,100
What is it?

88
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,500
- Complications with the Magisha baby.
- I'll go.

89
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,900
No, no. I'd better go.
I know the mother.

90
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,100
Ah, sorry. I'll be back
in an hour or two.

91
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,400
<i>Bonny.</i>

92
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,400
<i>Jump in.</i>

93
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,400
- Hi, Bonny.
- Hi.

94
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Mmm.

95
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
- I hope you don't mind me saying this, but-
- Yeah?

96
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,300
You seem an unlikely candidate
for this kind of work.

97
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,600
Why? 'Cause I don't wear
socks and sandals?

98
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,600
Touchi.

99
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,900
I still want to make
a difference, you know.

100
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,300
- Really?
- Yes, really.

101
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Want to have fun, too, though.

102
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,800
Bit of adventure.
Something different.

103
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
That's a lot of things.

104
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,900
Is it?

105
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,900
Yeah!

106
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,400
It's a beautiful goal
for Scotland!

107
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,400
Yeah!

108
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
That's a good one.

109
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,900
Hey, Bonny, why are the women singing?

110
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
<i>You don't know?
The president is coming to the village.</i>

111
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,700
Where's Dr. Merrit?

112
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,600
- He has gone to town for stores.
- Right.

113
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,300
Come on. I thought you might be
slightly curious to see the new boss.

114
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,200
I don't work for Amin.

115
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,300
Right. Fine.

116
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,300
Just thought
it might be... fun.

117
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Okay.

118
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,800
Okay, okay.

119
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,700
Amin!

120
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,400
Amin! Amin!

121
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,000
Amin! Amin!

122
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,800
<i>Amin! Amin!</i>

123
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,300
And I want to promise you...

124
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,100
this will be a government
of action, not of words.

125
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,100
We will build new schools,
new roads!

126
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,200
And new houses!

127
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
<i>I may wear...</i>

128
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,600
the uniform...
of a general...

129
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,000
but, hey-

130
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,600
In my heart,
I am a simple man.

131
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,800
Like you.

132
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,300
I know who you are
and everything that you are.

133
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,000
I am you.

134
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,600
Ask my soldiers.
All my life...

135
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,400
I never eat food
until my soldiers have eaten first.

136
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,000
It will be like this
in Uganda now.

137
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,500
Together, we will
make this country better.

138
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
And stronger!

139
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,200
And free!

140
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,800
Whoo! Whoo!

141
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,100
<i>- Have you seen enough now?
- What?</i>

142
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Have you seen
enough now?

143
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,800
<i>Just- Just a couple
of minutes.</i>

144
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,100
Whoo!

145
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,300
Whoo.

146
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,200
<i>- Can we please go now?
- Okay.</i>

147
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,800
They sang just like that
for Obote...

148
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,500
until they realized that he turned
their economy into a personal bank account.

149
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,700
Oh, come on. Give the man a chance.

150
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,100
I'm serious.
You talk to me in a couple of years.

151
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,100
What's going on?

152
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Jesus.

153
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,100
What's the problem?

154
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,700
They're looking for a doctor.

155
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,700
The president's been hurt
in an accident.

156
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,800
We have to come. We'll follow you?

157
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,900
God. How terrifying.

158
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,900
My hand!

159
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,900
- Whoa. Whoa.
- My hand is broken!

160
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,700
Get that farmer out of my sight!

161
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,900
Hey. Hey.

162
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,300
Come. Come here.

163
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,400
My name's Dr. Garrigan.
I hear you have a problem with your hand.

164
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,200
I'd like to examine it. Hmm?

165
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,400
There you go.
Okay, now do a fork.

166
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,600
Raise your thumb like that.

167
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,900
<i>Okay. How's that?</i>

168
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,600
Sarah, I think we're gonna
need a splint here.

169
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,900
Please, can somebody do something
about that bloody cow?

170
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,400
I don't think you've broken it.
I think it's just sprained.

171
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,600
Please! It's in pain!

172
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,300
Can you just hold that now with your other hand?

173
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,300
Sarah, can you go and talk
to that farmer about his cow, please?

174
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Sarah, how's it goin'?

175
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,400
Will somebody please
put that animal out of its misery!

176
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,700
<i>I'm trying
to explain to them!</i>

177
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,300
For God's sake!

178
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry. I-

179
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,800
<i>- I couldn't hear myself think.
- You took my gun.</i>

180
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
- Yeah.
- Who are you?

181
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
<i>Nicholas-
I'm Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.</i>

182
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,700
I work at the medical compound in Mgambo.
I'm a doctor.

183
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
<i>You are British.</i>

184
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,300
Brit- Uh, well-
I'm Scottish.

185
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,500
I'm Scottish.

186
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,800
- Scottish?
- Yeah.

187
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,500
Why didn't you say so?
I fought with the Scots against the Mau Mau.

188
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,500
Great soldiers.
Very brave.

189
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,500
And good people.
Completely.

190
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,600
Let me tell you, if I could be anything
instead of a Ugandan...

191
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
- I would be a Scot, my friend.
- Right. Really?

192
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Except for the- the red hair...

193
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,200
which I'm sure is attractive
to your women...

194
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,500
but which we Africans-
We find this quite disgusting.

195
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,000
Thank you, Dr. Garrigan.
A very good job.

196
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,000
Hey, please.

197
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,100
Would you let me
have this T-shirt?

198
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,500
My son, Campbell,
he would love this T-shirt.

199
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,200
- You've got a son called Campbell?
- Yeah.

200
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,900
Maybe you would take my-
my shirt here in exchange.

201
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,400
Right. Of course.
Yeah.

202
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,800
- Ah.
- Thank you.

203
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,500
Aha. You see?
Now you are a general, like me.

204
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,900
- Salute, please.
- Oh.

205
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,700
Now I must leave.

206
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,700
<i>And I bet you
that's worth a few bob.</i>

207
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Yeah.

208
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Hmm.

209
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,600
I still can't believe
how you shot that cow.

210
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,700
You're mad.

211
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,900
Um, anyway,
I think I have to go.

212
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,600
- Do you fancy a wee drink on the porch?
- No, thank you.

213
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,500
<i>I'm okay. Really.
I- Nicholas.</i>

214
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400
I have to go. No.

215
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,400
Look, it's fine,
all right?

216
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,000
We're just havin' a drink.

217
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,100
Oh, God.

218
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,000
- I can't do this.
- What?

219
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,500
My husband
is a good man.

220
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,200
Oh, Christ.
I sound ridiculous.

221
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,000
I guess I-

222
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,400
I guess I just need you
to understand why I'm here.

223
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,700
- It's okay. I do understand.
- No, you don't.

224
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,000
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

225
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,700
It's just, sometimes...

226
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,700
when you're married
to such a very good man...

227
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,900
it's-

228
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
- It-It makes you feel-
- Like shit.

229
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,700
My father's the same.

230
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,700
And...

231
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
it's nice to be noticed.

232
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,700
- Mmm. No, I can't. I can't. I can't.
- Sarah.

233
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,000
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

234
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,600
- No, I don't-
- Sarah, it's fine.

235
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,600
Don't, please.
Please.

236
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,700
<i>Nicholas.</i>

237
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,300
Nicholas, there are some people here to see you.

238
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,000
Be, um,
right there, David.

239
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,000
Right. Right.

240
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,900
- Good morning, Dr. Garrigan.
- Morning.

241
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,300
My name is Jonah Wasswa,
Minister of Health here in Uganda.

242
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,600
<i>I've been sent by His Excellency,
President Amin.</i>

243
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,300
- There is something he would like
to ask you in person. - Wh-What?

244
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,800
<i>Sarah?</i>

245
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,800
Oh, hey. Listen.

246
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,600
Why don't you tell David
to rearrange the field trip for Friday?

247
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,900
All right? I'll be back
as soon as I can.

248
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,600
He probably just wants me to retie his bandages.
Okay, I'll see you later.

249
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,300
My name is Masanga.

250
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,900
Nice to meet you.
I'm Nicholas.

251
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,700
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Nicholas.

252
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,300
Welcome
to the president's car.

253
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,100
<i>- They think you are the president.
- Eh?</i>

254
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,300
They think you are the president.

255
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
The president's house.

256
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,000
Please sit down.

257
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,200
His Excellency
will be with you in a moment.

258
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,900
- And who's this?
- Oh. Dr. Junju, the previous incumbent.

259
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,200
<i>- Of what?
- Of the post...</i>

260
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,900
of personal physician to the president.

261
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,700
Hold on to your guns!

262
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,000
Everyone!
Hold on to your guns!

263
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,700
- Good to see you again, Dr. Garrigan.
- You too.

264
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,100
You see, Jonah? This is the sort of man
a president needs around him-

265
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,800
someone who is not afraid
to speak his mind.

266
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,800
So, what do you say,
Nicholas?

267
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,700
Will you take the job?

268
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,700
Wha- I'm sorry.
Um-

269
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,300
- You want me to be your physician?
- Mmm.

270
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,300
- Do you want to be of service to Uganda, Dr. Garrigan?
- Yes, I do.

271
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,500
Then what better way...

272
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,500
than to look after the health
of its president?

273
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,100
And let me tell you,
it will not be a difficult job.

274
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,400
Because me, myself,
I am a man...

275
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,400
in perfect physical condition.

276
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,000
Also, I know precisely
when I will die.

277
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,200
It came to me in a dream.

278
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,900
So, you do not have to worry
about making a mistake.

279
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,500
- I'm really sorry. I'm-I'm very honored, but-
- Nicholas.

280
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
I understand.

281
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,200
Me, myself, I did not
want to be president.

282
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
But the people,
they wanted it so.

283
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,900
Listen to me.
This is very important.

284
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,400
Here, in Kampala...

285
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
you will have a hand
in creating...

286
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,300
a new health service
for this country-

287
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,700
something that will help
millions of people.

288
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,900
I'm sorry. I really do have a commitment
to the mission in Mgambo.

289
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,600
I'd be lettin' them down
horribly. You see?

290
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,600
Ah.

291
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,500
It's the woman,
the one I saw you with.

292
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
You want to get back
to be with her.

293
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,500
Well, not entirely.

294
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,600
It's the woman.
It's the woman.

295
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,800
Why don't you tell her
to come and be here with us?

296
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,300
Uh, well, it's not
that simple.

297
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,500
- It's quite complicated actually.
- Why?

298
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,300
- Is she married?
- Yes, she is.

299
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,600
Ah, Doctor.

300
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,800
Doctor, you-
you are very naughty.

301
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,100
Me?

302
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,300
Ah, now you are
even more interesting.

303
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,300
Married women, they are always
the most passionate, huh?

304
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Yes.

305
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
- It's true.
- They are so grateful, huh?

306
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,200
Hmm. Yes.

307
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,600
I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry
for wasting your time.

308
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
No, no.

309
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,200
My car will take you back
first thing in the morning.

310
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,700
But, in the meantime-
Tonight, we are having a state dinner.

311
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Please, would you
join us there?

312
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
I'd very much like that.
Thank you.

313
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,200
You have a suit?
Dark suit?

314
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,900
- No. No, I don't.
- Hmm.

315
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,100
How much is this gonna
cost me, by the way?

316
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
It's okay.
It's the president's account.

317
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,100
<i>- Oh, can I just-
- Hey! Stop!</i>

318
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
<i>- What's goin' on?
- Obote's men.</i>

319
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,000
- They're everywhere.
- Really?

320
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,600
Yep. They're communists,
you know?

321
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Mind you, Amin's
more than a match for them.

322
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,600
He's ex-British army-
King's African Rifles.

323
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,700
- Uh, Jamshid.
- Yes, sir?

324
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,300
Pack those up and have them sent to the
High Commission in the morning, please. Thanks.

325
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,300
<i>Yes, he's a little
unpredictable...</i>

326
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,300
but he's got
a firm hand.

327
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,900
Only thing the African really understands.

328
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,900
<i>- Thanks, Jamshid.
- You're welcome.</i>

329
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, up yours too, pal.
Bloody English.

330
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Hello.

331
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,100
Hello.

332
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,100
Hello there.
How do you do?

333
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,600
- Ah! Nicholas.
- Oh!

334
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
- I'm so happy you came.
- So am I.

335
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,200
Please. Please, this way.
I want to introduce you to my wives.

336
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,000
Excuse me. Here.
This is Malyamu.

337
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,400
She is my first wife.
She has given me five children.

338
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,700
Hello.

339
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,600
<i>And this one- Nora.
She has given me three.</i>

340
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,800
Hello.

341
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,000
And that here
is Kay. Yes.

342
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,700
<i>- This is Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.
- Hello.</i>

343
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,900
- He saved my life.
- Oh, wel- Really, I just stitched his hand up.

344
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,200
<i>- It was-
- Don't be so modest.</i>

345
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,900
I believe it is you
I have to thank for the T-shirt.

346
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,200
Oh, right.
So you must be Campbell's mother.

347
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,200
- Yes.
- It's a pleasure meeting you.

348
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,000
Please come. I have to introduce you
to some people here.

349
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Excuse me.

350
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,700
- This is, uh, British High Commissioner, Mr. Perkins.
- How do you do?

351
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,200
Please, meet my good friend
Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.

352
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,200
<i>And his colleague
Mr. Stone.</i>

353
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,000
- How do you do?
- Fine. Yes, we've already met.

354
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,100
- Well, I will talk with you later.
- Oh, right.

355
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,400
So, uh, Dr. Garrigan, we've been hearing
all sorts of things about you.

356
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,100
Yes, I, uh- I gather the president
has clasped you to his bosom.

357
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,500
Uh, no, no.
Not exactly.

358
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
What do you
make of him?

359
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,600
Well, I think he's doing
rather a great job.

360
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,000
- Don't you?
- Yes. He has some issues to be sorted out.

361
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,200
But, no, he plays
a pretty straight bat.

362
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,200
- Yes, definitely one of us.
- Anyway...

363
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,200
it's very good to, uh,
have another Englishman around.

364
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,900
- Scot.
- What?

365
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,100
I'm a Scotsman.

366
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends.

367
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,300
<i>I am speaking with you now
because if I wait until later...</i>

368
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,800
you will be too drunk
to hear my voice.

369
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,000
<i>- Here is where civilization began.
- Yes.</i>

370
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Here in Africa.

371
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,000
<i>Here is where the Greeks
stole their philosophy...</i>

372
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,500
and the Arabs took
their medicine.

373
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,300
We Ugandans must be more proud
of this history.

374
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,300
<i>We are an independent
African nation...</i>

375
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,500
<i>living in peace
and economic power.</i>

376
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,300
- Black power.
- Yes.

377
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Just like all you people
thought would never be possible.

378
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,700
<i>And now we will go through
to dinner.</i>

379
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,300
The food tonight,
it is all local...

380
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,900
special food.

381
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,300
And none of it
is human flesh.

382
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,900
This is my last.

383
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,200
Dr. Garrigan. Please come quickly.
The president is very sick.

384
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,300
They have poisoned me.

385
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,100
They are trying
to assassinate me.

386
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,000
- Nicholas.
- Okay.

387
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,600
I just have to examine
your stomach.

388
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,000
<i>Obote's people are everywhere.
They want me dead, Nicholas.</i>

389
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,400
Okay, I'm just-
I need to do this. Okay?

390
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,900
One more. One more.

391
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,400
Okay. Okay.

392
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,100
Okay.

393
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,400
Okay. I think I know what this is.
Let me listen, just listen.

394
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,000
Okay. Yeah, okay.
I think I know what this is.

395
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,600
Bear with me. Uh-

396
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,000
There we go.

397
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,200
There we are.
Okay.

398
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,700
I'm gonna ask you
to sit on this pouf right here.

399
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,400
- Hey! What is this?
- It's okay. It's okay.

400
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,100
- What is this?
- It's okay. I'm just gonna hold it against your stomach.

401
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,400
<i>I'm gonna ask you to stand up...
in three.</i>

402
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,100
One, two, three. Go.

403
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,500
I feel better,
much better.

404
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,600
<i>Ah. Ah, yes.</i>

405
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,800
You are a good doctor.
Thank you.

406
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,600
In future, remember
not to mix beer with aspirin.

407
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,000
- That was the cause?
- I think so, yes.

408
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,200
I am ashamed
that you saw me like that.

409
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,500
- I was frightened.
- I'm a doctor.

410
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,300
Everything that passes between us
is confidential.

411
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,000
Okay? I've taken an oath.

412
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,300
But a man who shows fear,
he is weak...

413
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,100
and he is a slave.

414
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,100
Well, if you're afraid
of dying...

415
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
it shows you have
a life worth keeping.

416
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,300
Ah.

417
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,900
You see?

418
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You are a doctor...
and also a philosopher.

419
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,100
Yes.

420
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,200
I do have
a good life now.

421
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,700
Please.
Please, sit.

422
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,700
Sit here.
Sit here.

423
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,000
I come from...
a very poor family.

424
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,200
I think
you should know this.

425
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,300
My father, he left me
when I was a child.

426
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,800
The British army,
it became my home.

427
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,800
They took me as a...

428
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,100
cleaner in the kitchen,
cleaning pots.

429
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,200
They used to beat me.

430
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,200
"Build this wall, Amin. "

431
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,900
"Dig this latrine, Amin. "

432
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,200
And now here I am,
the president of Uganda.

433
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,000
And who put me here?
Huh?

434
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,200
It was the British.

435
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,400
What a story.

436
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,700
- Good night, Nicholas.
- Good night, sir.

437
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,900
<i>Uh, hello. Sarah, it's Nicholas.</i>

438
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,300
<i>- Nicholas, where are you?
- I'm still in Kampala actually.</i>

439
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,100
Thank you.

440
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,300
<i>Look, the president's
offered me a job here.</i>

441
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
<i>Normally, I wouldn't even
bother considering it.</i>

442
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,800
<i>- But, under the circumstances...
- Thank you.</i>

443
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,500
<i>I thought it might
be quite a good idea.</i>

444
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,900
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

445
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,300
David will be disappointed.

446
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,800
Oh, well, I'll write to David.
Of course I will.

447
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Of course.

448
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,000
I just hope you can do as much good there
as you could've done here.

449
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,400
Look, somebody's
callin' me.

450
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,700
I'd, uh, better go.

451
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,300
- Sure.
- All right. Well, listen. Bye, Sarah.

452
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,700
- I'll be in touch.
- Bye.

453
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,200
<i>When you're not treating
the president or his family...</i>

454
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,500
the hospital could use
your expertise here.

455
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,600
<i>This is one
of our new medical wards.</i>

456
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,900
Farther down the corridor
will be the operating theaters...

457
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,900
which the president
has paid for himself.

458
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,700
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Doctor.</i>

459
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,500
- Welcome to Mulago, Dr. -
- Garrigan. Hello.

460
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,900
I do hope you find the hospital
up to the standard you are used to.

461
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,900
Uh, excuse me.
Who was that?

462
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,300
Your predecessor-
Dr. Junju.

463
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,100
<i>- Never mind him.
- Excuse me, sir. Two men to see you.</i>

464
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,200
- Excuse me a moment.
- Of course.

465
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,900
- Hello. Jolly nice of you.
- It's very nice.

466
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,000
<i>Dr. Garrigan.</i>

467
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,100
Just topping up on quinine.

468
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,100
So, you've decided to stay.

469
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,300
- Uh, yes. Yes, I did.
- Excellent. Excellent.

470
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,400
Well, listen,
I just wanted to say...

471
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,500
that if there's anything
we can possibly help you with...

472
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,600
please don't, um,
hesitate.

473
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,400
What, you're my new best friend now?

474
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,000
Do just stay in touch.

475
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,400
Why?

476
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,800
Well, given
that we were so, uh...

477
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,200
<i>intimately involved
with the president coming to... power...</i>

478
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,200
the Foreign Office has asked me
to point out our awareness...

479
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,800
of your very unique personal relationship
with President Amin.

480
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,800
Mm-hmm?

481
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,500
Should you find the need to clarify your status...

482
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,200
regarding the details
of that relationship...

483
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,500
we would of course welcome
any clarification you might...

484
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,300
feel the need to share with us.

485
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,600
Is there some special school
where you people...

486
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,100
learn to talk
that bollocks?

487
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,100
Do, please, stay in touch.

488
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,400
You-You take care now.

489
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,200
This man is going to kill-
He's going to kill the president.

490
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,200
So Nicholas walks up to that cow,
and he shoots it in the head.

491
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,800
On your marks!

492
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,500
Get set!

493
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,700
Go!

494
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,200
Amin! Amin!

495
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,500
- Ho!
- I won.

496
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,400
Hit my hand. Yes.

497
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,400
- Okay. Nicholas.
- Oh, no, no, no.

498
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,900
Before I forget,
I need to ask a favor.

499
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,900
Anything.

500
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I will be in Libya
next week...

501
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,300
and I need you to attend
a meeting in my place.

502
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,500
- What kind of meeting?
- A simple matter of taste and common sense.

503
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,800
I cannot think of anyone
better than you.

504
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,700
Ah, gentlemen, please.
Don't get up.

505
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
<i>The president
sends his apologies.</i>

506
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,900
He's been called away-
on short notice.

507
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,500
He's asked me to step in.

508
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,500
- And you are?
- Nicholas Garrigan, his doctor.

509
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,400
<i>- His doctor?
- Yes.</i>

510
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,100
- And you are?
- I'm the Austrian foreign minister.

511
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,900
This is Dr. Ramml,
one of our leading architects...

512
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,600
and Dr. Brunner
from the Institute of Civil Engineering.

513
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,700
Together,
we are the first bid.

514
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,900
Bid, right.

515
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,400
For what precisely?

516
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,300
I love it.

517
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,300
Good choice.

518
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,300
Modern, elegant-
a symbol of Uganda's future.

519
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,900
<i>- Here is where we will have the
next Pan-African Congress. - Nice.</i>

520
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
My two closest advisors-

521
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,000
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

522
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,500
- Look what Nicholas has designed for me.
- Nice.

523
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,100
- I didn't design anything. It was more-
- That's nonsense.

524
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,900
You have a wonderful eye.

525
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,700
Jonah- he has...
no taste.

526
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,200
<i>Look at him.</i>

527
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,200
Even his suits,
they look silly.

528
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,600
Is that not right, Jonah?

529
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,700
What is it you want, Jonah?

530
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,500
I have some ministerial papers
for your signature.

531
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,800
Go.

532
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,100
I will sign them later.

533
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,500
I do not like the way
that man looks at me.

534
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,700
Do you think
he looks at me strangely?

535
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,500
No. No, I can't say
that I've noticed.

536
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,400
Okay. Enlargement
of the medial sternum...

537
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,300
and reticular nodular
lung patterns-

538
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,200
<i>all indicating
pulmonary T.B.</i>

539
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,300
Yeah, but it could be disseminated-

540
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,000
What was that?

541
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,400
Makindye Prison-
where Obote's people are being held.

542
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,700
Can you hear that?

543
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,300
<i>Dr. Garrigan! Dr. Garrigan!</i>

544
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
Please! Come quickly.

545
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,400
<i>The president's son
is sick.</i>

546
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,400
What's wrong with him? What's wrong with him?

547
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,800
<i>Can you hear me, child?
I'm begging you to stop it. Mackenzie!</i>

548
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,200
- Thank you. You can step away.
- Stop it, Mackenzie. Please.

549
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,400
- Thank you. Your son's epileptic?
- I don't know.

550
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,700
- What? Has he been like this before?
- Yes.

551
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,600
Right. Can you hold his knees
up against his chest?

552
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,400
- Yeah, yeah.
- If you can do that. Okay. The other hand back here.

553
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,900
<i>- This is Campbell?
- It's Mackenzie, Campbell's brother.</i>

554
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,500
- Mackenzie? Right.
- Come on, Mackenzie. Come on, baby.

555
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,800
Mackenzie,
I am Dr. Garrigan. Okay?

556
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,900
<i>We're gonna
sort you out.</i>

557
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
- We'll get you to hospital. It's gonna be fine.
- No, no, no.

558
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,200
- The president will not allow it.
- I really think the child-

559
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,000
- You must do what you can do from here.
- The child has to go to hospital.

560
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,900
Please! Please.

561
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,600
It's okay now, baby.
Mama's here.

562
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,000
Mama is here.
It's okay. Mama's here.

563
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,900
Okay. Okay.

564
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,900
<i>There you are. Okay.
Okay.</i>

565
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,900
- There we are.
- Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

566
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,200
<i>- I thought I was losing him.
- It's okay. He's gonna be fine.</i>

567
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,400
<i>Could you, uh- Could you move the toys
from that bed, please?</i>

568
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,700
Could you move the toys
from that bed, please?

569
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,400
Ah.

570
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,000
Big boy.
Big boy.

571
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,100
Here we go.

572
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,100
It's okay, baby.
I'm so sorry.

573
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,400
It's okay.
Don't say sorry.

574
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,800
<i>Don't say sorry.</i>

575
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,100
- This is where you live?
- Yes.

576
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Why not at State House
with the other wives?

577
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,300
Since I had Mackenzie, my husband prefers us
to be somewhere more private.

578
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,300
That's ridiculous.

579
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,100
<i>I think this child
has epilepsy.</i>

580
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,100
It's a perfectly treatable
condition.

581
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,500
- The president does visit you here?
- He visits the children, not me.

582
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,100
I am a bad omen.

583
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,400
Okay.

584
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,200
Okay, I'm gonna make an appointment
for Mackenzie at the hospital.

585
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,700
All right?

586
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,300
I will tell the president
how helpful you have been.

587
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,800
<i>Very nice.</i>

588
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,700
<i>Good morning, Nicholas.</i>

589
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,200
I could not go without thanking you
for helping my son-

590
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,900
Don't mention it.

591
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,200
and to bring you
a small gift.

592
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,700
No doctor should be
without his ambulance.

593
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,000
For me?

594
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,500
Yes. Come. Come.
This is yours here.

595
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,600
Oh.

596
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,000
<i>Uh-huh?
What do you think?</i>

597
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,800
Are you serious?
It-It's a fantastic gift.

598
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,500
Are you happy now? Eh?
Let's try it.

599
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,700
You can drive me to the airport.
I have to fly to Libya on business.

600
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,600
- Don't you think that I should get dressed?
- Quickly then. Quickly.

601
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,800
- Now? Right.
- Yes.

602
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,900
I'll just be a minute.

603
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,400
- Are you comfortable here?
- Yeah, very much. Thank you.

604
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,400
Ah.

605
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,800
So, uh, it- it was Obote's men
who attacked the prison, yeah?

606
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,900
- Yes.
- Right.

607
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,100
We heard the gunfire
all the way at the hospital.

608
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,200
- Yes, and my soldiers, they held them off.
- Oh, right.

609
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,400
<i>We thought we were going
to be inundated with casualties.</i>

610
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,300
Do you want to drive your car?
I want to see you drive your car.

611
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,300
- Okay.
- Please. Come.

612
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,300
- Come.
- Okay. Okay.

613
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,500
So, you do not like the way
I treat my son.

614
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,300
Uh, no.
No, I don't.

615
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,600
Hiding him away like that,
it's-it's ruining his life.

616
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,300
That boy
has everything he wants.

617
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,000
Except the treatment
that could save him.

618
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,900
He has comfort
and luxury in life.

619
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,500
- Money? Sir, it's no substitute for anything.
- Nicholas.

620
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,900
You have never been poor.

621
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,900
What about Kay?
Don't you think it's, uh-

622
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,100
Do not speak about things
you do not understand.

623
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,000
But the way
you are concerned...

624
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,500
it has touched me,
and I will consider.

625
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,200
You know, I like this type
of frank conversation.

626
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,300
Yes. I respect
your honesty...

627
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,300
<i>and your opinion
completely.</i>

628
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,000
- Nicholas!
- Stop!

629
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
- Shit! Shit!
- Drive! Drive.

630
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,300
<i>Drive past! Drive!</i>

631
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,900
Drive!

632
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,300
Obote's men!
I'm sure of it!

633
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,800
If I had not been
in your car-

634
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,200
But... it is in my dream.

635
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,100
They cannot kill me. It is in my dream.

636
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,900
<i>Somebody told his men
my travel plans.</i>

637
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,900
Somebody is betraying me.

638
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,600
<i>I cannot trust... anybody.</i>

639
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,300
I'm surrounded...
by traitors!

640
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,800
Masanga.

641
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,900
Nicholas.
Nicholas.

642
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,800
<i>You know Masanga?
He is one of my people.</i>

643
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,500
He will handle all
of my security matters from now on.

644
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,400
Yes, sir.

645
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,300
- You will take care of me and this country.
- Yes, sir.

646
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,800
Where is Jonah Wasswa?
Where is he?

647
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,800
I need my minister.

648
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,900
A minister should be
by his president's side.

649
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,700
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

650
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,700
And you call yourself
my closest advisor?

651
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,000
Huh?

652
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,500
You see?

653
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,000
You see?
These loyal soldiers...

654
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,500
already they have
captured the criminals.

655
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,600
Do not pity them,
Nicholas.

656
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,100
These men here,
they wanted you dead.

657
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,800
Why did you try to kill me?

658
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,500
<i>Huh?</i>

659
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,700
<i>I will not die...
until I say!</i>

660
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,300
Look at me!

661
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,700
<i>Obote!</i>

662
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,900
Huh?

663
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
<i>You work for him!</i>

664
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,600
Obote! Huh?

665
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,900
That-That...
drunk, silly man!

666
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,400
You want to kill me
for that drunk, silly man?

667
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,400
Huh?

668
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,500
Uganda loves me...

669
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,100
because I am loyal...

670
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,500
and I am fair.

671
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,700
I am your president.

672
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,800
Come, Nicholas.

673
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,600
<i>This is no place for us.</i>

674
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,800
<i>These I can read you later.</i>

675
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,900
And the rest-The rest
are just pro forma papers for you to sign.

676
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,200
Um, I left a small list
of medical equipment at the end...

677
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,800
<i>for my old surgery
in Mgambo.</i>

678
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,600
<i>Is there anything else,
Nicholas?</i>

679
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,400
Eh?

680
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,100
Nicholas?

681
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,300
It's probably nothing, sir.

682
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,000
What?

683
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,100
Nicholas, you are
my closest advisor.

684
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,100
<i>Please.</i>

685
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,100
<i>Tell me
what is on your mind.</i>

686
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,400
Last night, I went to the Holiday Inn
and had a drink.

687
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,900
I saw Jonah Wasswa there
speaking to some white guy in the bar.

688
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:06,000
<i>Something about it
just didn't seem right.</i>

689
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,700
It's- It's probably nothing...

690
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,500
but, uh, you might wanna
have a talk with him.

691
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,500
Just- Just a talk.

692
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,900
<i>Like I say,</i>

693
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Good night, sir.

694
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,500
- Ah. How are you?
- Very well. How are you?

695
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,000
Very well.
See you next week.

696
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,300
Would you care for a drink?

697
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,600
That's very good, Mackenzie.

698
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,600
<i>Very good.
Go show your brother.</i>

699
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,100
<i>Hiya.</i>

700
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,900
Hiya.

701
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,500
Uh, he's looking
much better.

702
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,500
Much better.

703
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,800
That other one is Campbell.

704
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,900
He is the one
who got your T-shirt.

705
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,300
You're a man of taste.

706
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,000
<i>Mummy! Mummy!</i>

707
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,100
Please, goodbye.

708
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,600
<i>- Mummy! He keeps pushing me! Mummy!
- Okay, stop it.</i>

709
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,900
<i>Stop it, Mackenzie.</i>

710
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,200
<i>Dr. Garrigan. Daydreaming?</i>

711
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,500
Well, looking at you, Stone,
I certainly hope so.

712
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,100
I wasn't expecting to find you here.

713
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,700
I thought you'd be with the president
on his trip to London.

714
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,700
No, I'm needed here.

715
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,000
- I do hope the man hasn't blown up again.
- Uh, what?

716
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
<i>I was reading this article in the Times.
I don't know if you've seen it.</i>

717
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:23,000
<i>It seems a high court judge who recently
ruled against Amin has gone missing.</i>

718
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:27,600
<i>- Hasn't been seen for five days.
- I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation.</i>

719
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,800
Well, the thing is,
we've been getting reports...

720
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,900
up and down the country
of the same thing.

721
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,300
People speaking out
against the regime...

722
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,500
just, uh, disappearing.

723
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,000
No. Look, if you're gonna accuse the president
of something, you just come out and say it.

724
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,300
- All right?
- I was just hoping you might be able...

725
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,900
to give us a little
clarification.

726
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,600
Oh, fuck your clarifications,
Stone! Fuck them.

727
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,200
You people amaze me.

728
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,800
You know, the first sign of an independent
African leader actually achieving something...

729
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,800
and what do you do?

730
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,300
You spit your dummy because you can't stand
the idea that he's done it without you.

731
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,000
I know he's maybe a little bit rough,
but what do you expect?

732
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:11,500
Do you think Obote's people
are sittin' around waitin' for clarifications?

733
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,600
Look at me.

734
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,400
This is Africa.
You meet violence with violence.

735
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,000
Anything else,
and you're dead.

736
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,000
Well, then perhaps
you'd be so kind...

737
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,800
as to explain to me the whereabouts
of Health Minister Wasswa.

738
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,000
What?

739
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,200
Well, he's, uh-
he's missing too.

740
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,700
But, as you say,
I'm sure there's some, uh...

741
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,800
perfectly normal
explanation.

742
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,600
I'm, uh, having drinks later...

743
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,800
with the man
who wrote the article.

744
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,500
Perhaps you'd like
to join us...

745
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,600
and shed some light
on the matter.

746
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,300
- Fine. I will.
- All right. Six o'clockish.

747
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,600
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm here to see the health minister.

748
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,000
I'm afraid she's busy.

749
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,700
<i>You were right.</i>

750
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,800
The health minister has gone missing.
Apparently, he's fled to Tanzania.

751
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,300
<i>What? Jonah Wasswa?</i>

752
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,300
<i>Mmm.</i>

753
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,000
<i>It appears he's embezzled several hundred
thousand pounds' worth of Ministry funds.</i>

754
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:41,000
And some people are suggesting
that he's joined up with Obote's exiles.

755
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,900
<i>- I find that very hard to believe.
- The man was on the verge...</i>

756
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,700
of sealing a major
pharmaceutical deal.

757
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,700
Life-saving penicillin for the masses.

758
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,800
<i>I should know. I set up the meeting
with his South African counterpart...</i>

759
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,000
at, um, the Holiday Inn.

760
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,000
<i>So, this embezzlement-
is it on the record?</i>

761
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,900
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- And I can quote you in the paper?

762
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,400
- I'm sorry? Quote me?
- Not directly, of course.

763
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,400
As a government spokesman.

764
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,400
Government spokesman?

765
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,800
Aye.

766
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,600
Mr. President.

767
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,400
I've come to say good-bye.

768
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,700
I'm going home.

769
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,900
<i>Mr. President?</i>

770
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,200
<i>Boo!</i>

771
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,900
I got you.
I got him.

772
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,500
Nicholas, meet my
body double, Wzenga.

773
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,500
Look at him.
Everything the same.

774
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,600
<i>Except-
What do you say, Nicholas?</i>

775
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,100
Is he as handsome as me?

776
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,000
- No. No, he's not.
- Aha! You see?

777
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,900
<i>You see? Nicholas agrees.
You are much more ugly than me, Wzenga.</i>

778
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,400
<i>Look, look, look, Nicholas.
I have others also.</i>

779
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,900
<i>All part of Captain Masanga's plan
for my security.</i>

780
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Clever, huh?

781
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,100
Yeah.

782
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,100
Nicholas.

783
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,100
My Nicholas.

784
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:33,100
What is all this
about your going home?

785
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,100
Hmm?

786
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,100
We-

787
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,400
<i>You once told me
that you respected me...</i>

788
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,500
'cause I wasn't afraid
to speak my mind.

789
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,600
Mmm. Speak.

790
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,300
It's this business with Wasswa.

791
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,400
I can't-

792
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,000
It fucking stinks. And I can't help coming
back to that moment...

793
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,700
when I asked you
to talk to him.

794
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,900
Look, this isn't me.

795
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,200
<i>I have to go home now.</i>

796
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,200
You cannot.

797
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,500
What?

798
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,100
<i>Your work is not
finished here yet.</i>

799
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,800
But I didn't come here
to finish anything.

800
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,800
You promised to me...

801
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,500
that you would help
to build a new Uganda.

802
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,500
<i>You swore an oath.</i>

803
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,500
The oath is, um-

804
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,500
It's- It's a doctor's oath of confidentiality.
We all take it.

805
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,600
- It's got nothing to do with Uganda.
- Huh?

806
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:40,500
Nothing?
Nothing comes from nothing.

807
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,100
You have a conscience.

808
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,300
I know you do.

809
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,900
<i>That is why you came here
in the first place.</i>

810
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,500
Or are you like
all the other British?

811
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:59,700
Just here to fuck
and to take away.

812
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,000
No.

813
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,600
- No.
- No.

814
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:08,500
Why else would I trust you
with my family?

815
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,400
You are like my own son.

816
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,000
I'm Nicholas Garrigan...

817
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,000
and I'm from Scotland.

818
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,200
That's my home.
I want to go-

819
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,800
Your home is here.

820
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,000
Please.

821
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,000
Just, please-

822
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,500
Do not be a silly boy.

823
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,500
If you go now, what will they think about you
and, uh, Jonah Wasswa?

824
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:43,100
What are you talkin' about?
I said- I said talk to him.

825
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,800
Do not pretend to yourself
that you did not know.

826
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,800
You are a stronger man
than that.

827
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,300
I didn't want him
to die though.

828
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,200
But you-you did it.

829
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,200
- Why? You want to know why?
- Mm-hmm.

830
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,100
You did it because...

831
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,600
you love me.

832
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,700
You have stepped deep
into the heart of my country.

833
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,900
Uganda.

834
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,200
Uganda embraces you.

835
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,000
Nicholas.

836
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,800
Nicholas.

837
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,100
What you need
is to have some fun.

838
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,800
<i>Hey, Nicholas.
Where have you been?</i>

839
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,900
- I want you to meet Betty.
- Betty.

840
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,700
And this here is her sister Joy.

841
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,700
- Joy.
- Hello.

842
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,100
- Hello.
- Joy is going to look after you this weekend.

843
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,600
Joy-

844
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,200
- All right.
- All right.

845
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,600
And now, let the games begin.

846
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,800
Yes.

847
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,900
Nicholas. You did not know we had
Ugandan cowboys, eh?

848
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:51,300
Finance Minister.

849
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,000
<i>Come here.</i>

850
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,800
All right.

851
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,200
Can I have another whiskey,
please?

852
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,200
<i>Well, let me tell you, Nicholas,
you've chosen a fine life.</i>

853
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,000
<i>You want to kill me for that drunk, silly man?</i>

854
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,800
<i>Nicholas. Nicholas.</i>

855
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,000
<i>Dr. Garrigan.</i>

856
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:24,000
Jesus fucking Christ,
you look so lovely.

857
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,600
You know something?
I shouldn't be here.

858
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,100
I should be in Scotland
with my dad.

859
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,600
I should be looking after little old ladies,
'cause- 'cause here I've fucked up.

860
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,300
Kay, I fucked up.
I fucked up.

861
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,800
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Not here.

862
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,600
- Walk with me.
- What?

863
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,600
Walk with me.

864
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,600
- I'm fucking doomed.
- Watch your head.

865
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,300
You know he's got
go-go dancers after me now?

866
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,100
Where are we going?

867
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,400
I don't know.

868
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,400
<i>Nicky?</i>

869
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,400
Oh, shit!
It's the go-go dancer.

870
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,400
- Oh, uh- uh-
- Nicky?

871
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,700
In here.
In here. Come on.

872
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,800
Just follow me.
Up here.

873
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,900
Shh! Shh!

874
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,700
You be quiet.
Shh!

875
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,000
Oh, fuck it.

876
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,600
He has always
been like this.

877
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,700
He just chose not
to show you until now.

878
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,400
Nicholas.

879
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,100
You have to find
a way to get out.

880
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,300
He still listens to me.

881
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,400
He cannot trust
anybody anymore.

882
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,300
I'll wait
till things get really bad.

883
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,600
They are... really bad.

884
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,900
Huh?

885
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
What?

886
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,200
- Nothing.
- What?

887
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,400
I just had this mad image
of me and you sittin'...

888
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,500
at my mother and father's
dinner table.

889
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,400
Oh.

890
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,100
"More stew, Mrs. Amin?"

891
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,800
Nicholas.

892
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,300
You've got to get out.

893
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,300
<i>To the lake!
Everybody to the lake! President's order!</i>

894
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,300
Everybody to the lake!
To the lake!

895
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,400
<i>- What is going on?
- President's order!</i>

896
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,700
- I don't know.
- What if somebody saw us?

897
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,100
Okay. You just wait two minutes
and then come out after me, all right?

898
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,200
Yeah.

899
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,000
Go, go, go, go.

900
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,300
Shit.

901
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,700
Dr. Garrigan.

902
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,100
It's 4:00
in the morning.

903
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,100
Can I have a word with you?

904
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,800
- Whiskey?
- Okay.

905
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,300
They've, uh-

906
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,500
They've taken my passport.

907
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,700
You were saying that
if there was ever anything you could do-

908
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,100
I need to get out of here
while I still can.

909
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,300
I was hoping you might
be able to help in that.

910
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,500
- Please.
- "Please. " It's a nice touch.

911
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,800
Mmm.

912
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:43,100
Have you any idea what's
going on in this country, Dr. Garrigan?

913
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,700
Some.

914
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,700
In the countryside, they're not even
bothering to dig graves anymore.

915
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,400
They're simply feeding them
to the crocodiles.

916
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,000
Right here in Kampala,
right under our noses...

917
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,000
he's wiped out the entire
political opposition.

918
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:06,300
<i>Thousands of Acholi...</i>

919
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,600
<i>and Langi tribesmen
from the army.</i>

920
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,000
He's hardly even bothering
to cover it up anymore.

921
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,900
<i>Even members of his own cabinet.</i>

922
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,600
Your friend
the health minister.

923
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,900
This man is actually
trying to help his country.

924
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,400
Idi always seems
to get it wrong, doesn't he?

925
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,700
Jesus fucking Christ.

926
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,400
Get me out of here.

927
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,100
<i>You earn
your passage first.</i>

928
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,100
Wha-What?

929
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,600
You know what
they're calling you?

930
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,700
His white monkey.

931
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,600
I'm his doctor.

932
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,000
It's not my job
to judge the man.

933
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,200
<i>"I'm his doctor. "
Is that your defense? How pathetic.</i>

934
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,300
Fuck off, Garrigan.

935
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,300
We don't just hand out passports
to chimps like you.

936
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:25,400
<i>Particularly not chimps
with blood on their hands.</i>

937
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,800
Look, you, I'm a citizen,
and I have rights.

938
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,300
Fuck your rights. You do as I say,
or you don't get out of here.

939
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:38,600
You're his doctor.
You have unprecedented access to him.

940
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,600
Obviously,
we'd help you with...

941
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,100
anything you needed.

942
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,200
You want me to kill him?

943
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,100
<i>Amidst persistent rumors...</i>

944
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,900
<i>of human rights violations
and economic mismanagement...</i>

945
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,800
<i>the situation in Uganda
has deteriorated badly in recent months.</i>

946
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,700
<i>The opening of
10 new hospitals has had to be deferred...</i>

947
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,000
<i>and all the rest of them-</i>

948
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,000
<i>But getting any definite
information on the country...</i>

949
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,400
<i>has become harder and harder.
President Amin has accused...</i>

950
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,700
<i>the British government of attempting
to assassinate him and undermining him-</i>

951
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,300
<i>And so his policies
are growing ever more unpredictable.</i>

952
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:05,400
The British government
has broken its promises to Uganda.

953
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,200
<i>Because of this,
I have decided to expel...</i>

954
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:13,100
all Asians from this country.

955
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,700
And these people,
they are leeches.

956
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,400
They milk the cow...

957
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,800
but they do not want
to feed the cow.

958
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:24,900
No longer.
They have 90 days to leave.

959
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,300
<i>They are too sick to leave.</i>

960
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,600
Take your hands off him!

961
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,600
This is a sick man. How dare you!

962
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,900
I don't care where
you get your orders from!

963
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,300
<i>You cannot come into a hospital
and start shoving people!</i>

964
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,300
They are forcing us
to leave!

965
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,500
Whoa!

966
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:06,600
This is a hospital!

967
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,800
You get your men
out of here now!

968
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:28,600
I'm complaining personally
to the president.

969
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,600
<i>You all right?</i>

970
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,400
I'll see to this.

971
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:40,700
You're trying to help your people.
I understand that.

972
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,900
But Uganda isn't ready, sir.

973
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,900
You expel the Asians now,
this economy will be on its knees.

974
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,800
Not to mention the damage you'll do
to your reputation abroad.

975
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:56,000
Is that what
you came here for?

976
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,500
To plead...

977
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,300
for your fucking
Asian tailor?

978
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,600
These things
do not concern you.

979
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,600
You are nothing
but a doctor.

980
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,600
You are a nobody.

981
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,100
Get out.

982
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,200
Get out!

983
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,500
Sarah!
Sarah!

984
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,600
- Hello?
- Oh, I can't believe-

985
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,700
What have we done?

986
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,700
Who?
Kay, is that you?

987
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,000
He is going to kill us,
Nicholas.

988
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,300
He's going to kill us.

989
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,500
I have to get it out of me.

990
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,700
He will kill me, Nicholas.

991
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,800
I have to get it out.

992
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,200
<i>- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.</i>

993
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,400
I want you to do it.

994
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:53,600
Please. You're a doctor.
I know you can do it.

995
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,500
- I know you can do it, Nicholas.
- No, we can't!

996
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,700
I can't do that!

997
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,300
This isn't some
simple procedure.

998
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,700
It has to be done under clinical conditions.

999
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:12,000
<i>I have to- If you don't do something now,
I'm going to have to find a place to go.</i>

1000
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:16,300
<i>I'm- I'm going to have to get it done
in one of the villages. Is that what you want?</i>

1001
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,500
No. No, you don't.

1002
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,700
Come here. Whatever you do,
you don't do that.

1003
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,700
All right?

1004
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,300
I'm gonna sort
something out. Just...

1005
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,600
promise me you'll
stay in the house.

1006
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,000
Please promise me
you'll stay in the house.

1007
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,100
P- Promise me this-

1008
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,400
Promise me this is
going to be all right.

1009
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,400
I promise.

1010
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,700
We'll do it first thing
in the morning.

1011
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:54,000
- Kay Amin?
- Mm-hmm.

1012
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,600
- The president's wife?
- Yes.

1013
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:00,700
No. No, no, no.

1014
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,500
- We couldn't do that here. Not at Mulago.
- Why not?

1015
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,000
It's the president's hospital!
He's bound to find out.

1016
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,700
- We could do this discretely, Tommy.
- No!

1017
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:15,000
He would kill her and us.
It's too much to risk.

1018
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,700
What other choice
does she have?

1019
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,000
Some-Some backstreet job
in a village somewhere?

1020
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:24,600
Come on, Thomas.
You know what that means.

1021
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:28,400
It's the only choice
you've left her.

1022
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:34,000
But I don't expect it crossed
your mind to wonder, huh?

1023
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,000
A white man
with a black woman.

1024
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:40,600
What does she need
with such things?

1025
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,600
Fine.

1026
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,800
I'll do it myself.

1027
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,100
The president
wants to see you now.

1028
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,900
My head is exploding!

1029
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,900
I- I can't think!
I can't sleep!

1030
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,200
Look at this!
Look at this!

1031
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,600
The British newspapers
say I am a madman.

1032
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:39,300
The American newspapers
say I am a cannibal.

1033
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,000
I am a cannibal, huh?
Huh?

1034
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,000
These are lies!

1035
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,000
I should throw them out
for good.

1036
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,100
Only Ugandan press
from now on.

1037
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,500
- Do you want something for the headache, sir?
- No.

1038
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,500
- Something to help you sleep perhaps?
- Later.

1039
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,300
I want you to tell me
what to do.

1040
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,800
You want me to tell you
what to do?

1041
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,800
Yes. You are my advisor.

1042
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:04,700
You are the only one
I can trust in here.

1043
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,000
You should have told me not to throw
the Asians out in the first place.

1044
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:10,000
I did.

1045
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,200
But you did not
persuade me, Nicholas.

1046
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,200
You did not persuade me.

1047
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,200
Huh?

1048
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,500
Tell me what to do here.

1049
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,300
Don't throw
the journalists out.

1050
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,300
They're only gonna write
more lies about you.

1051
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:39,100
Invite them to meet you
face-to-face.

1052
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,100
You charm them.

1053
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,500
You show them
what kind of a man you are.

1054
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,400
Hmm.

1055
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,700
You think this will work?

1056
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,100
<i>I think that's the Amin
they need to see.</i>

1057
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,400
Thank you.

1058
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,400
Thank you very much,
Nicholas.

1059
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,400
What would I do
without my Nicholas, huh?

1060
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,400
What would I do
without my Nicholas?

1061
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,100
Is there something
going on here?

1062
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,400
- Huh?
- No.

1063
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,400
No.

1064
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,100
- No.
- Is there?

1065
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,700
- No.
- Huh?

1066
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:39,200
- No.
- Are you sure, Nicholas?

1067
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,200
Yes.

1068
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,900
Yes.

1069
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,800
Give me a booster.

1070
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,800
Something to make me
feel strong again.

1071
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,500
- Sir.
- Where are you going, Nicholas?

1072
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:24,500
I have, uh, something
that I have to attend to.

1073
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,900
Uh-uh.
No.

1074
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,900
<i>You have to stay here.</i>

1075
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,800
<i>I need you for
the press conference.</i>

1076
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,600
This is all very well, Your Excellency,
but what about the reports of mass killings?

1077
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:51,600
Who have you been talking with?
The British?

1078
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:55,900
<i>Go. Look around Uganda
for missing people.</i>

1079
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
<i>Go anywhere you please.</i>

1080
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:00,300
<i>So why would the British spread these rumors?</i>

1081
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,900
<i>Yeah?</i>

1082
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,700
Because... they hate me...

1083
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,300
because I refuse
to recognize South Africa-

1084
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,300
a racist regime
that they support.

1085
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,800
Also, they are
jealous of me.

1086
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,800
<i>Why?</i>

1087
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:23,800
<i>Because while they are starving
with their strikes and with their protests...</i>

1088
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:27,500
the people of Uganda are eating
beef and driving big cars.

1089
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,400
I have-

1090
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:36,600
I have created
the Save Britain Fund.

1091
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:41,100
We Ugandans, we like to help our friends.
So, the Ugandans have got together...

1092
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:44,600
<i>and saved three tons
of food and vegetables...</i>

1093
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,900
<i>for their friends in England.</i>

1094
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,800
Because they are having economic difficulties,
let me assure you here.

1095
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:07,600
Kay?

1096
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:12,100
It's Nick.
Kay, it's okay. It's Nick.

1097
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,400
- What?
- She went to the village.

1098
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,700
We had to take her
to hospital.

1099
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,700
<i>It's been reported that you've
crowned yourself the last king of Scotland.</i>

1100
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:34,000
Yes. My good friends,
the Scottish people...

1101
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:37,200
have seen how I have
defeated the English here...

1102
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,600
and they want me to do
the same for them there.

1103
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,300
Yeah, her.
This woman here.

1104
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:55,700
<i>Did you "wrote" the queen of England,
offering yourself as a lover?</i>

1105
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:00,700
<i>You- You- You are- You are very cheeky.</i>

1106
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,900
And this is what happens
when you betray the president.

1107
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,700
This is what happens
when you betray him.

1108
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:02,800
<i>I'm not turned off to sex.</i>

1109
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,200
<i>I enjoy it.
I could spend the rest of my life getting laid.</i>

1110
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:20,000
<i>There should be more to it
than a lot of little tingles.</i>

1111
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:39,800
They say she has a clitoris
halfway down her throat.

1112
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:43,400
Is this possible...
medically?

1113
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,300
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1114
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,500
Almost all aberrations of nature
are possible.

1115
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,600
I made an example of her...

1116
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,200
<i>because she betrayed me.</i>

1117
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,100
I brought you those headache
pills that you asked for.

1118
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,200
Good.

1119
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,800
Is there anything else?

1120
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,800
No. No, that's all.

1121
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,900
Then go.

1122
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,400
We are busy here.

1123
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,100
<i>Uh-huh.
All?</i>

1124
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,800
Good morning.

1125
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:20,700
Come on.

1126
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,300
- Shit.
- Hello?

1127
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,900
- Yes?
- Come on.

1128
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,200
Yes, sir.

1129
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,700
Nicholas,
there you are!

1130
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,500
- Were you trying to run away from me?
- No. No.

1131
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,600
- Huh?
- No.

1132
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:44,200
I need you at the airport
right away...

1133
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:47,500
- to help me with the hostages.
- H-Hostages?

1134
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:52,800
Yes. An Air France aeroplane has been hijacked
by our Palestinian brothers.

1135
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:55,300
They have landed here
at Entebbe.

1136
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,800
The eyes of the world
are on Uganda today.

1137
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:02,500
Come, Nicholas.
To work.

1138
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:22,300
How many passengers?

1139
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,900
250?

1140
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,800
<i>And how many of them
are Zionist?</i>

1141
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,200
And, uh, television?

1142
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:34,600
<i>Plenty of
television cameras?</i>

1143
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:43,000
<i>Mmm. Yes. Tell them to take the hostages
to the terminal building.</i>

1144
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,900
<i>- Mr. President, the press is waiting for you, sir.
- All right.</i>

1145
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,700
<i>I wanted to assure you that the hostages
will get the best medical care.</i>

1146
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,300
<i>I have made
my own doctor available.</i>

1147
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,300
Doctor? Doctor,
what's the situation here?

1148
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,400
We've one woman
with a heart condition.

1149
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,700
She's already gone to hospital.
A few cases of shock.

1150
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,600
<i>And we're giving malaria pills
to everyone.</i>

1151
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:55,300
<i>- Okay, who's not been seen by a doctor yet?
- I haven't.</i>

1152
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,800
<i>- We haven't.
- How many of you are there?</i>

1153
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:00,400
<i>- I haven't, please.
- You neither?</i>

1154
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:04,600
<i>- You've not been seen yet?
- Malaria pills. How is everybody doing?</i>

1155
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:07,000
Thank you very much.

1156
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,800
Okay. Um, okay. Anybody else?

1157
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,500
<i>Okay. Take these three.</i>

1158
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,300
<i>The nurse is gonna
come round with water. Nurse?</i>

1159
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:24,700
Thomas? Thomas, can you
take these, please?

1160
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,700
- All right.
- Just be two minutes.

1161
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,700
Just take one.
Malaria pills. Thank you.

1162
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,400
<i>Stop! Don't!</i>

1163
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:55,000
Spit.

1164
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,900
Look at you.

1165
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,400
Is there one thing
you have done that is good?

1166
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,600
Did you think
this was all a game?

1167
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,400
"I will go to Africa...

1168
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:16,000
and I will play the white man
with the natives. "

1169
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:20,400
Is that what you thought?

1170
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:23,700
<i>We are not a game, Nicholas.</i>

1171
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,100
We are real.

1172
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:31,900
This room here-

1173
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,900
it is real.

1174
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:38,400
<i>I think your death...</i>

1175
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:41,100
will be the first
real thing...

1176
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,200
that has happened to you.

1177
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,000
Listen to me, Nicholas.

1178
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,400
Listen.
I know.

1179
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,400
Yes.

1180
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:57,500
I know about you and Kay.

1181
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,400
How could you do that to me?

1182
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:09,600
I am the father
of this nation, Nicholas.

1183
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,000
And you have most grossly...

1184
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:15,800
offended your father.

1185
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:22,700
You're a child.

1186
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,000
That's what makes you
so fucking scary.

1187
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:50,100
In my village...

1188
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:54,100
when you steal...

1189
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:57,200
the wife of an elder...

1190
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,300
they take you to a tree...

1191
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,800
and they hang you
by your skin.

1192
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,100
Each time you scream...

1193
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:11,900
the evil comes out of you.

1194
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,600
Sometimes it can take
three days...

1195
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:21,800
for your evil to be spent.

1196
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:29,600
Pull him up.

1197
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,000
Good evening.

1198
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:43,100
I have good news.

1199
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:48,000
The Israeli government
has agreed to negotiate.

1200
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:54,200
So, as a gesture
of good faith...

1201
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,500
all non-Israeli hostages
will be released.

1202
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,000
I have arranged,
personally...

1203
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,700
an aeroplane to come
and collect you.

1204
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,500
Yes, yes.

1205
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,800
He'll be here
when we come back.

1206
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:36,000
<i>This way, Israelis!</i>

1207
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,200
<i>Israelis stay here.</i>

1208
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:25,700
They have sent a plane.

1209
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:28,400
They are releasing
some of the hostages.

1210
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:32,200
If you go now, you will
reach them before they leave.

1211
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,300
Here. Put this on.

1212
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:38,300
Why-Why are you
doing this?

1213
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:41,300
Frankly...

1214
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,300
I don't know.

1215
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,800
You deserve to die.

1216
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,800
But dead,
you can do nothing.

1217
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:53,300
Alive...

1218
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:56,100
you might just be able
to redeem yourself.

1219
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:58,900
I don't understand.

1220
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:05,700
I am tired of hatred,
Dr. Garrigan.

1221
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:08,900
This country
is drowning in it.

1222
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
We deserve better.

1223
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:16,000
Go home. Tell the world
the truth about Amin.

1224
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:19,900
They will believe you.

1225
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,900
You are a white man.

1226
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,900
What about you?

1227
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,900
My fate is in God's hands.

1228
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,500
<i>Go. Now. Before they come back.</i>

1229
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,500
Thank you.

1230
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,600
Go. Go.

1231
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:35,100
<i>I said stop!</i>

1232
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,800
Where is the doctor?

1233
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,500
I don't know.

1234
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,000
Destination Paris.

1235
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,100
My wife-

1236
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:23,000
Because many of the people who,
uh, broke relations with Israel...

1237
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:25,500
<i>they are not only Muslims,
they are also Christians.</i>
