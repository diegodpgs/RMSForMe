197
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:42,999
No, we did that yesterday.
I don't want to do that.

Don't get me started

Every holo-date I have been on
has been a virtual disaster.

If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.

237

There are no good men out there.

Honestly, it's the one thing

<i>Well, good morning, everybody,</i>

EVE.

502
01:05:59,181 --> 01:06:00,773
EVE.

503
01:06:02,151 --> 01:06:03,118
Pathetic.

504
01:06:06,689 --> 01:06:07,713
EVE.

505
01:06:16,098 --> 01:06:17,588
EVE!

506
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:19,734
Oh!

507
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:35,750
Huh?

508
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,848
Foreign contaminant.

509
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,786
There you go, little guy.

510
01:06:48,897 --> 01:06:51,730
You came a long way
for a drink of water.

511
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:54,530
Just needed someone
to look after you, that's...

512
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:09,745
We have to go back.

513
01:07:11,887 --> 01:07:14,685
<i>- Auto, come down here.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

514
01:07:15,257 --> 01:07:16,224
WALL-E.

515
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,920
WALL-E.

516
01:07:21,764 --> 01:07:24,562
<i>Auto, EVE found the plant.
Fire up the holo-detector.</i>

517
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:27,397
Not necessary, Captain.
You may give it to me.

518
01:07:27,503 --> 01:07:30,939
- You know what? I should do it myself.
- Captain.

519
01:07:32,207 --> 01:07:35,404
Sir, I insist you give me the plant.

520
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:38,969
- Auto, get out of my way.
- We cannot go home.

521
01:07:39,081 --> 01:07:42,847
- What are you talking about? Why not?
- That is classified, Captain.

522
01:07:42,951 --> 01:07:45,249
- Give me the plant.
- What do you mean, "classified"?

523
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:46,821
You don't keep a secret
from the captain.

524
01:07:46,922 --> 01:07:48,014
Give me the plant.

525
01:07:48,123 --> 01:07:50,455
- Tell me what's classified.
- The plant.

526
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,390
Tell me, Auto! That's an order.

527
01:07:56,231 --> 01:07:57,698
Aye, aye, sir.

528
01:08:01,603 --> 01:08:06,973
<i>* Buy N Large is your superstore
We got all you need *</i>

529
01:08:07,076 --> 01:08:08,202
<i>Just cut it off, will you?</i>

530
01:08:09,578 --> 01:08:13,309
<i>Hey, there, autopilots.
Got some bad news.</i>

531
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:15,008
<i>Um...</i>

532
01:08:16,251 --> 01:08:17,809
<i>Operation Cleanup has,</i>

533
01:08:18,687 --> 01:08:20,154
<i>well, failed.</i>

534
01:08:21,023 --> 01:08:23,821
<i>Wouldn't you know,
rising toxicity levels have made life</i>

535
01:08:23,926 --> 01:08:25,655
<i>unsustainable on Earth.</i>

536
01:08:25,761 --> 01:08:27,729
"Unsustainable"? What?

537
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:31,856
<i>Darn it all, we're going to have
to cancel Operation Recolonize.</i>

538
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:32,991
<i>So,</i>

539
01:08:34,169 --> 01:08:35,466
<i>just stay the course.</i>

540
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:36,663
<i>Um...</i>

541
01:08:36,772 --> 01:08:38,763
<i>Rather than try and fix this problem,</i>

542
01:08:38,874 --> 01:08:42,173
<i>it'll just be easier
for everyone to remain in space.</i>

543
01:08:42,277 --> 01:08:43,437
"Easier"?

544
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:46,214
<i>- Huh?
- Sir, time to go.</i>

545
01:08:46,315 --> 01:08:50,809
<i>Okay. I'm giving
Override Directive A 113.</i>

546
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:53,444
<i>Go to full autopilot.</i>

547
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:56,990
<i>Take control of everything,
and do not return to Earth.</i>

548
01:08:57,092 --> 01:08:59,287
<i>Repeat, do not return to Earth.</i>

549
01:08:59,461 --> 01:09:00,928
<i>Let's get
the heck out of here.</i>

550
01:09:05,401 --> 01:09:07,665
Now, the plant.

551
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:09,738
No. Wait a minute.

552
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:12,204
<i>Computer, when was that message
sent out to the Axiom?</i>

553
01:09:12,307 --> 01:09:14,741
<i>Message received
in the year 2110.</i>

554
01:09:14,843 --> 01:09:18,244
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

555
01:09:18,347 --> 01:09:21,373
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

556
01:09:21,483 --> 01:09:24,145
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth. "

557
01:09:24,253 --> 01:09:29,190
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

558
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:32,624
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, Captain.

559
01:09:32,728 --> 01:09:36,721
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

560
01:09:36,832 --> 01:09:38,094
Home, Auto.

561
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,931
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

562
01:09:42,037 --> 01:09:43,334
That's all I've ever done.

563
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,738
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

564
01:09:46,842 --> 01:09:49,174
<i>On the Axiom you will survive.</i>

565
01:09:49,278 --> 01:09:53,977
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

566
01:10:12,067 --> 01:10:14,592
<i>I'm the captain of the Axiom.</i>

567

569
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:26,947
Hey! That's not...

570
01:10:27,049 --> 01:10:29,609
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

571
01:10:35,891 --> 01:10:39,725
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

572
01:10:40,429 --> 01:10:41,418
No!

573
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:52,731
Huh?

574
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:56,943
- EVE?
- WALL-E!

575
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:58,706

577
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:03,049

- Over here. Throw it.

578
01:11:03,151 --> 01:11:04,118
Ahhh!

579
01:11:04,486 --> 01:11:05,453
EVE!

580
01:11:06,655 --> 01:11:08,247

WALL-E!

582

01:18:45,974 --> 01:18:47,134
Let go.

652
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:50,101

- Too heavy for you? Huh?

653
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,647
Get off.

654
01:18:53,748 --> 01:18:55,409
You're not getting away
from me, one-eye.

- Get off.
- Is that all you got?

656
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:12,724
Halt.

657
01:19:16,538 --> 01:19:18,301
- That's it. A little closer.
- Cease and desist.

658
01:19:18,406 --> 01:19:20,340
- Not good.
- Got you.

659

01:20:33,915 --> 01:20:35,473
Hey. What? John?

667
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:37,350
Whoa!

668
01:20:54,902 --> 01:20:56,301
No! No, no, no!

669
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:03,672
I gotcha!

670
01:21:07,282 --> 01:21:09,682
John, get ready to have some kids!

671
01:21:23,931 --> 01:21:24,989
Look out!
- Ah!

672
01:21:35,443 --> 01:21:36,410
Oh!

673
01:21:44,352 --> 01:21:45,341
No.

674
01:21:51,092 --> 01:21:52,491
WALL-E!

675
01:22:02,603 --> 01:22:03,592
No!

676
01:22:05,206 --> 01:22:06,173
Uh-oh.

677
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:09,777
Oh, no!

678
01:22:34,702 --> 01:22:35,760
Auto?

679
01:22:40,775 --> 01:22:41,935
WALL-E!

680
01:22:51,652 --> 01:22:54,855
Auto, you are relieved of duty.

681
01:22:56,057 --> 01:22:58,184
No.

682
01:23:07,702 --> 01:23:10,637
Plant! Plant!

683
01:23:19,881 --> 01:23:20,973
Foreign contaminant.

684
01:23:22,383 --> 01:23:24,078
Plant!

Oh, no. WALL-E.

<i>...three, two, one, zero.</i>

693
01:24:12,233 --> 01:24:14,326
WALL-E!

694
01:25:39,887 --> 01:25:40,854
WALL-E.

695
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:44,316
EVE!

696
01:26:25,366 --> 01:26:26,697
Huh?

697
01:26:50,591 --> 01:26:51,751
WALL-E.

698
01:27:01,235 --> 01:27:02,702
EVE.

699
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,307
Ooh!

700
01:27:12,947 --> 01:27:14,107
WALL-E?

701
01:27:19,553 --> 01:27:20,520
Ooh!

702
01:27:22,957 --> 01:27:27,223
<i>* Put on your Sunday clothes

707
01:29:16,771 --> 01:29:17,795
EVE!

708

Whee!
- You're kidding!

711
01:29:34,522 --> 01:29:36,285
Go, go, go. Go, go.

712
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:40,557
<i>* And we'll recall
When time runs out *</i>

713
01:29:40,661 --> 01:29:42,629
This is called farming!

714
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:45,290
You kids are going to grow
all kinds of plants.

715
01:29:45,399 --> 01:29:47,663
Vegetable plants. Pizza plants!

716
01:29:48,903 --> 01:29:50,871
It's good to be home!

717

722
01:30:53,601 --> 01:30:58,163
<i>* By what gravity brings
to the ground? *</i>

723
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:05,442
<i>* Did you feel you were tricked

01:32:08,876 --> 01:32:11,401
<i>* Despite all you made of it *</i>

739
01:32:11,879 --> 01:32:16,077
<i>* You're always afraid
of the change *</i>

740
01:32:20,554 --> 01:32:23,489
<i>* You've got a lot on your chest *</i>

741
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:26,423
<i>* Well, you can come as my guest *</i>

742
