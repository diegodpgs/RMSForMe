1
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,554
{girl} Papa?

2
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,959
{man} Hmm?

3
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,430
- {girl} Tell me a story.
- {man} Alright. What about?

4
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,876
{girl} I don't know. About everything.

5
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,359
{man} Everything?

6
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,911
Very well, then.

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,715
In Tierra del Fuego, land of fire...

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,271
...a blighted and loveless country
on the Earth's furthest rim,

9
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,512
lives a community
of the dirtiest, most vulgar,

10
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,194
least civilised people
you can possibly imagine.

11
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,910
They appeared almost entirely naked

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,151
with their hair
all the way down to their bottoms.

13
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,630
They never washed their hands
or their faces, even before dinner.

14
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,077
One day, Captain Fitzroy
went ashore to meet them.

15
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,117
Thank you.

16
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,753
Not long now. I shall be with you
presently. Head to me, please.

17
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,469
Very good. Now, very still, please.
No fidgeting.

18
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,313
And above all, no smiling.

19
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,996
- Excuse me, sir?
- Hmm?

20
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,675
- Will this hurt?
- Oh, no, no, no.

21
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,399
It is only a beam of light.

22
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,599
- Papa?
- Hmm?

23
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,671
How can light make a picture?

24
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,355
Well, they take a copper plate
and they prepare it with chemicals,

25
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,273
and these chemicals are activated

26
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,954
by the light that reflects back
from your face,

27
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,077
and so the silver

28
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,870
sticks to the places where the light
is brightest. Understand?

29
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,473
- Yes.
- {clears throat}

30
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,518
- Sorry. So sorry.
- No, thank you.

31
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,309
- Go on. He went ashore to meet them.
- {Darwin} Yes, that's right.

32
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,029
So, arm, Captain Fitzroy went ashore
to interview the Feigns.

33
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,599
Now.

34
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,478
{Darwin} He offered them
some axe heads, some calico,

35
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,039
and very pretty buttons.

36
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,588
Total value, probably two shillings.

37
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,433
{Fitzroy} This is yours. You take it.

38
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,991
Look how it... Look how it glisters.
See?

39
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,714
{Darwin} And all he asked in return?

40
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,679
A few spare children.

41
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,797
You give me el Nina.

42
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,999
{Darwin} To the Feigns, children
were cheap and buttons were precious,

43
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,913
so it wasn't long
before the Feigns had their trinkets

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,878
and Captain Fitzroy
had his three children.

45
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,428
He named them Boat Memory...

46
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,354
...Jemmy Button and Foggia Basket.

47
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,751
{children scream}

48
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,589
{man}
Come here, you dirty little beggar!

49
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,671
{men shout}

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,038
{Jemmy yells}

51
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,829
{Darwin} The good captain
had them washed and dressed,

52
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,639
and he taught them
the proper table manners.

53
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,515
{food bounces}

54
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,350
Boat Memory died of smallpox,
but the two littlest ones,

55
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,513
they learned their prayers
and their times-tables so excellently

56
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,194
that they were invited
to meet the King and Queen.

57
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,317
Everyone agreed
that good Christian values

58
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
had tamed the most savage of hearts.

59
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,474
The King gave Jemmy
a genuine brass telescope

60
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,714
and the Queen gave Foggia one of her
Sunday best bonnets to keep forever.

61
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,359
Two years later,
Captain Fitzroy and I took them home,

62
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,672
accompanied by a young missionary,
in the belief that, by example,

63
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,911
they would bring their fellow savages
to God.

64
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,311
And what do you think happened?

65
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,994
It didn't work.

66
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,310
That's right. Of course it didn't work!

67
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,311
{children shout}

68
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,272
- Go after them, you fool! Get them now.
- Jemmy! Foggia!

69
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,796
- Put your clothes back on! Come back!
- {children shout}

70
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,111
{Darwin}
It was a complete and total failure.

71
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,634
- {chuckles}
- {photographer} No, no, no!

72
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,435
Quite still, didn't I say?
You shall have to do it all over again.

73
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,159
- {click}
- So sorry. So badly behaved. So sorry.

74
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,392
{chuckles}

75
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,591
{clock chimes}

76
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,269
- {woman} Mr Darwin, sir?
- {knock at door}

77
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,193
Come on, Mr Darwin,
or your dinner will be spoiling.

78
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,911
{children chatter}

79
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,629
Mr D will be in presently, ma'am.
I imagine.

80
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,312
- Thank you, Mrs Davies.
- Is Papa unwell again?

81
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,996
- He's always unwell these days.
- He is not, Frankie.

82
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,231
{Frankie} Maybe he caught something awful
from the Hottentots.

83
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,788
{boy} Nanny Broody said
God was angry with him.

84
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,792
- Broody said no such thing.
- Yes, she did!

85
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,475
- Good evening.
- {children} Good evening, Papa.

86
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,233
Sorry I'm so late.

87
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,990
Soup du jour, sir.

88
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,517
- {sniggers}
- {Darwin} Thank you, Par slow.

89
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,349
{Emma} Lord God, bless this family
and the food we eat.

90
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,513
- We ask in Thy name. Amen.
- {children} Amen.

91
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,950
I hear Mr Hooker is coming tomorrow.

92
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,237
Yes. Yes, that's right.

93
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,479
Did he say what it was about?

94
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,077
I'm not sure
that now's the time to discuss it.

95
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,835
Perhaps the time to discuss it
was before you invited him.

96
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,357
Well, quite possibly, but he...
He invited himself.

97
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,634
Sorry.

98
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,998
Tell Mrs Davies it was delicious,
but my...

99
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,200
My stomach's still not quite what it...
it should be. Forgive me.

100
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,194
{door closes}

101
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,159
- {boy} Can we go fishing?
- {girl} Can we pick gooseberries?

102
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,676
{Darwin} October 17th, 1858.

103
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,309
Passed a poor night.
Stomach still wretched.

104
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,516
Noticed a slight tremor in right hand.

105
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,712
Consider increasing laudanum
by ten per cent, perhaps.

106
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,271
{Darwin} We'll sacrifice the two
tumblers. I want to skeletonise them.

107
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,918
{Par slow} Yes, sir.

108
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,798
{Darwin} Selective breeding
is undoubtedly working.

109
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,997
Already seeing real changes
in wing structure.

110
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,631
I'm convinced that all fancy breeds,
pouter, carrier, tumbler et cetera,

111
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,915
derive from the common rock pigeon.

112
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,628
Nature selects for survival,
man for appearance.

113
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,513
Must improve skeletonising methods.
Consider aqua regain, quicklime, perhaps.

114
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,996
They'll need a few more hours,
those, sir.

115
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,072
{horses approach}

116
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,398
{children shout excitedly}

117
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,388
Master George! Master Frankie! Lady Jetty
and Master Lenny. How are you, sir?

118
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,591
- Sir?
- Thank you.

119
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,319
Anything else, sir?

120
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,234
No, no, no, you... carry on.
I'll clean myself up.

121
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,233
{boy} Is it true that he only let you go
if you married his fattest daughter?

122
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,154
Absolutely true, George,
but don't you dare tell my wife.

123
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,549
- Dear Joseph.
- Dearest Emma.

124
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,708
- {door closes}
- Ah. Yes. Forgive the short notice.

125
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,439
- You know Thomas Huxley?
- Only by reputation.

126
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,512
- He insisted on coming.
- It's a lie.

127
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,512
I have a question
for your esteemed, reclusive husband

128
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,034
and I didn't trust Hooker
to ask it for me.

129
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,999
I see. Children, tell Papa
his visitors are here.

130
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,469
- He already knows.
- He's hiding.

131
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,834
Do come in, please.

132
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,309
{boy}
Can we play Charge of the Light Brigade?

133
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,914
You must be exhausted.
Will you take tea?

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,074
Hooker! My dear fellow!
And Huxley. Do come in. Come in.

135
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,993
{Hooker} Lead the charge, boys.
And away we go.

136
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,594
{Huxley}
We're re-forming the Linnaean Society.

137
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,069
The committee will comprise of myself,

138
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,232
Lyell, Hooker, yourself, of course,
if you're game for it.

139
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,834
Now that Hooker
and I finally have a bit of clout,

140
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,480
we can start to reclaim science
as a profession.

141
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,836
Wrest it away from the country parsons
and beetle collectors.

142
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,230
- Some of whom are friends.
- Your book will be our rallying point.

143
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,878
No, it won't. There is no book.

144
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,191
There are fragments, and they're not
in any fit state to publish.

145
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,750
{Huxley} I've read your abstract
and the argument is hugely powerful.

146
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,037
Clear evidence of transformation
over millions of years

147
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,351
from a free-swimming prawn
to a shellfish stuck on a rock.

148
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,319
That's my point. You can't be sure of
that, and that's why I need more time.

149
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,994
- Mr Darwin, sir?
- Yes?

150
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,071
Either you are being disingenuous or you
do not fully understand your own theory.

151
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,188
Evidently, what is true of the barnacle
is true of all creatures, even humans.

152
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,512
The Almighty can no longer claim to have
authored every species in under a week.

153
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,397
You've killed God, sir.

154
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,671
You have killed God.

155
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,115
{Hooker} Or to put it another way...

156
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,476
{Huxley} And I say good riddance
to the vindictive old bugger!

157
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,348
- {Hooker} Charles? Charles?
- Oh, no, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

158
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,874
- Thomas, please.
- Yes, I quite understand.

159
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,394
It is time to write your book.

160
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,109
Strike hard and fast
with a blow that is utterly conclusive.

161
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,792
{Darwin} Really, sir, you...

162
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,393
You talk as if we're at war.

163
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,393
Yes. Science is at war with religion,
and when we win,

164
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,233
we'll finally be rid of
those damned archbishops

165
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,118
and their threats of eternal punishment.

166
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,555
No, Mr Huxley, we...

167
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,873
We live in a society and it is a society
bound together by the Church.

168
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,595
An improbable sort of barque,
I grant you, but at least it floats.

169
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,030
It floats. And you would what?

170
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,112
You would have us all rebuild,
plank by plank,

171
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,997
the very vessel in which we sail?

172
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,792
Oh, come, come, Charles! Did...
Did God's laws change your Feigns?

173
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,589
Was Jenny the ape any less personable
for not being a person?

174
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,196
Our behaviour, like our physical forms,
evolves according to our needs.

175
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,872
Your very own words, sir!

176
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,956
And thus, in time, we lose those parts
that are no longer required.

177
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,828
Like the appendix, the male nipple,
and finally, thank Christ,

178
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,037
our belief
in an utterly redundant Almighty!

179
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,912
Mr Hooker?

180
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,149
I... implore you,
please do not push him.

181
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,755
No one can push Charles.
You know how fixed he is.

182
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,718
- Bit of a barnacle himself, really.
- Yes.

183
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,519
And if you prise him from his rock,
he will die.

184
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,238
Come on, Hooker. It'll be dark soon.

185
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,270
{dogs bark}

186
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,198
- {door closes}
- So, what did she say to you?

187
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,756
She said it was killing him.

188
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,078
Yes. Mighty slow death considering the
length of time he's sat on this stuff.

189
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,229
{blows nose}

190
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,630
We shall all be dead and buried
ourselves if he takes much longer.

191
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,472
{Hooker} Yes, since his girl died,

192
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,758
one has to admit...
he's not the man he was.

193
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,951
{vomits}

194
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,790
{splutters}

195
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,271
{dog barks}

196
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,111
{spits}

197
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,437
When are you going to be done
with those stinky old barnacles?

198
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,670
{Darwin} Well, I've been chasing
this little crustacean

199
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,878
in all of its evolutionary forms
over 30 million years.

200
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,714
Now, eight years doesn't seem a very
long time to achieve that, does it?

201
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,914
What does "procrastinating" mean?

202
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,438
Oh, I think you know very well
what it means, Annie.

203
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,710
It means putting things off. Why?

204
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,199
{Annie} That's what Mr Hooker
thinks you're doing.

205
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,191
Does he indeed?

206
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,198
Is it because of Mama
or what's in that box?

207
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,391
Both.

208
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,951
- I should probably just burn the lot.
- You can't. I'm in it.

209
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,156
Don't be absurd! Of course you're not.

210
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,629
- What do you mean?
- When I was a baby, you said.

211
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,196
- Oh, that.
- The Natural History of Babies.

212
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,351
- Yes, that's right.
- {baby cries}

213
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,431
Look at my finger.

214
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,316
Oh, you're so strong! You're so strong!

215
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,998
{gentle piano music}

216
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,514
- Here. Annie.
- {bell jingles}

217
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,711
{blows raspberries}

218
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,028
I think that will not help her sleep.

219
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,476
I'm sure you're probably right.
{chuckles}

220
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,949
Who's that?

221
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,554
Who is that? Is that you?

222
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,437
{growls}

223
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,514
- {Annie cries}
- Oh, sweetheart. Oh, I'm so sorry.

224
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,673
- Oh, what a mean old papa you have.
- {cries}

225
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,830
Oh, sweetheart! {chuckles}

226
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,480
Oh, what a mean old papa you have!

227
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,599
What a mean old...

228
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,148
What a mean old man you have!

229
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,438
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

230
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,590
"Six weeks: gurgles."

231
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,797
"Tries to suck.
Holds tight to my finger."

232
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,553
"Perceives bosom
when three or four inches from it."

233
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,710
I should add that she's musical.

234
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,157
I hope you do not plan to treat all our
children as specimens of the ape genus

235
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,959
to be included in your experiments.

236
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,271
All of our children?
You mean you want more?

237
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,998
{Annie cries}

238
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,672
Oh, sorry. I assumed.

239
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,514
No, if the idea doesn't appeal,
then we won't have any more children.

240
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,275
Darling, I have plans to breed
an entire army of them.

241
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,353
Look at that. That's called the waltz.

242
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,589
{children laugh}

243
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,598
Careful, now! Not too far ahead.

244
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,036
- Make yourself useful, Hooker.
- Stay away from that water!

245
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,396
Fear not, Broody,
I have them in my sights. Children!

246
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,954
Now, which of the four of you

247
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,271
would be the first who would
like to learn how to hook a worm?

248
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,713
{children} Me! Me!

249
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,509
{Emma} "A little further on,
the leading Highlander snuffed the wind

250
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,511
like a setting Spaniel,

251
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,637
and then made a signal to his party
again to halt."

252
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,679
"He stooped down upon all fours,
wrapped up in his plaid..."

253
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,718
- Look what I found, Mama.
- Look at that.

254
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,712
- What shall I feed it?
- {Emma} Let's ask Reverend Innes.

255
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,791
Oh, arm...

256
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,237
A leaf, I should think.
Necrophorus humidor, isn't he, Charles?

257
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,075
- Rather a splendid specimen.
- Yes, he is. He's a... carnivore.

258
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,118
He eats carrion and insects.

259
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,760
Boys! We need carrion and insects!

260
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,991
{gasps}
Look, here's a worm, here's a worm.

261
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,311
- {girl} An earwig! Squish it!
- {Hooker} No, don't kill it.

262
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,755
I know that expression.

263
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,118
He's dreaming of his glory days when he
was unencumbered with wife and family.

264
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,953
Free to wander the planet.

265
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,636
Actually, I was...
I was remembering how the tropical seas

266
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,358
teemed with living particles

267
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,955
that seemed to surround the Beagle
with a luminous glow

268
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,918
and leave a glistening pathway
through the night.

269
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,431
{birds sing}

270
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,991
Puzzling.
So much beauty for so little purpose.

271
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,039
So little purpose? They were helping
to light the ship's way.

272
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,873
Well said. Exactly.

273
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,353
John, are you familiar
with the works of Thomas Malthus?

274
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,713
- He married his first cousin.
- So did I.

275
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,874
- Yes, but I wasn't suggesting that...
- Of course you weren't.

276
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,555
Anyway,
Thomas Malthus calculated that if,

277
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,518
well, if every trout, say,
had a hundred or so offspring

278
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,353
and so on and so forth
throughout the generations,

279
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,433
we'd be knee-deep in trout
in just a few decades.

280
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,078
How would you respond to that?

281
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,869
I'd respond by saying that
most of the eggs are destroyed or eaten

282
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,397
so that the numbers remain stable.
That's the beauty of God's plan.

283
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,835
It doesn't strike you
as a wasteful plan,

284
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,356
these myriad lives created
only to be immediately extinguished?

285
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,193
- They provide food for others.
- Cheese and cucumber?

286
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,431
Thousands die
so that only a few may live.

287
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,559
Is not the sum total of happiness
in some sort of massive deficit?

288
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,189
Charles, it is really not my duty
to speculate on the mind of God,

289
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,829
but it does seem to me
that nature is at peace.

290
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,399
{Hooker sighs}

291
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,393
There is another view.
That all of nature is a battlefield.

292
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,029
Remind me where I read that.

293
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,034
- {Innes} This is very good.
- {Emma} Good. Shall I continue?

294
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,111
Hmm, please do.

295
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,150

296

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,515
{squelching}

309
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,870
{clock ticks}

310
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,869
{Emma} "'Now,' thought Christian,
'What shall I do?"'

311
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,636
"And ever and anon the flame and smoke
would come out in such abundance

312
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,430
with sparks and hideous noises that
Christian was forced to put up his sword

313
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,911
and betake himself to another weapon
called All Prayer."

314
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,151
Let us stop there.

315
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,034
{Jetty} Is Papa not coming
to kiss us goodnight?

316
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,829
{Emma} He is a little unwell
from working. Maybe tomorrow.

317
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,229
{George} You said that last night.

318
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,956
I think when Annie died,
he stopped loving us.

319
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,917
No, Jetty.

320
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,118
He's just a little bit tired
and a little bit busy.

321
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,319
Goodnight, darling.

322
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,274
- What are you doing, Annie?
- I'm making you beautiful.

323
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,551
But I need to think.

324
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,950
What are you so scared of?

325
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,599
- It's only a theory.
- No, they're right.

326
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,029
It changes everything.

327
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,318
Suppose the whole world
stopped believing

328
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,472
that God had any sort of plan for us.

329
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,313
That nothing mattered.
Not love, not trust.

330
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,834
Not faith, not honour.

331
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,790
Only brute survival.

332
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,150
Apart from anything else,
it would break your mother's heart.

333
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,152
Hearts can't break, silly.
You told me that.

334
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,678
Breathe in, Papa. Breathe out.

335
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,150
- Tell me a story.
- Alright. What about?

336
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,389
About Jenny.

337
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,070
- It's late. I have no time.
- Please?

338
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,631
- Why Jenny? It's so sad.
- I like sad stories.

339
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,711
{wind whistles}

340
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,193
Once upon a time,

341
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,238
there was a family of orang-utans

342
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,039
living in the deepest jungles
of Borneo.

343
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,111
{birds sing}

344
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,278
Their eldest daughter
was the most loving, the most caring,

345
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,669
and the most trusting orange of all.

346
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,071
But she was also the most...

347
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,912
Intelligent.

348
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,956
Well, I was going to say inquisitive.

349
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,950
Did I neglect to mention
she was not always

350
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,270
the most obedient of creatures?

351
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,351
{birds squawk}

352
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,231
{rustling}

353
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,353
{chatters}

354
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,469
By the time she realised her danger,
it was too late.

355
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,913
{all shout}

356
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,315
They put her in a bag
and they carried her off...

357
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,391
Much to her loving parents' despair.

358
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,235
So sorry. Much to her loving parents'
despair, of course. And the Dayaks

359
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,791
bundled her into a cage
and set off to sell her down the river.

360
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,350
They sold her to a trader
for three pence, three farthings,

361
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,753
and he put her in a bigger cage and sold
her to London Zoo for 300 guineas.

362
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,351
{orang-utan squeaks}

363
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,437
She was the first orang-utan
that anyone had ever seen in England.

364
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,512
Everyone peered at Jenny,
and Jenny peered back,

365
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,910
and she marvelled
at what strange creatures they all were.

366
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,069
The curators of the zoo, they...
they cleaned her up...

367
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,032
...made her presentable
for polite society.

368
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,636
Which was when
I was first introduced to her.

369
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,791
{click}

370
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,595
- {bell jingles}
- What is that, Jenny?

371
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,875
{bell jingles}

372
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,828
{Darwin makes sucking noise}

373
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,629
{plays harmonica}

374
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,355
- Oh, come on.
- {plays harmonica}

375
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,238
{stops playing}

376
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,160
{plays harmonica tentatively}

377
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,231
{chuckles} Bravo!

378
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,798
When eventually
it came time to say goodbye,

379
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,634
she grew quite downcast
and refused to shake my hand.

380
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,633
Finally, she took it, but only after
I'd made her a promise

381
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,679
I was never able to keep:
that I would visit her again

382
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,591
very soon.

383
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,949
Go on. Tell me about the bit
where she gets sick and dies.

384
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,395
- Why do you want to hear that bit?
- I like it. It makes me cry.

385
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,191
{waves crash}

386
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,191
{door opens}

387
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,072
Huxley is of the opinion
that I should write and be done with it.

388
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,311
Says it's a question
of moral courage, or of...

389
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,709
Or rather my lack of it.

390
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,511
Did you tell him about your health?

391
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,878
His theory is that I'm making myself ill
by holding back,

392
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,919
and... that I should lance the boil,
so to speak.

393
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,468
Thank the Lord he's no longer a surgeon.

394
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,791
I have concluded that he's right.

395
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,039
You know, bite the gag.
Speed is everything.

396
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,030
It will all be over
in a matter of months.

397
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,070
It is not mere months...

398
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,677
...nor even years nor decades
that concern me, Charles.

399
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,478
{sighs}

400
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,952
Do you really care...

401
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,033
...so little for your immortal soul?

402
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,238
Charles... do you not care

403
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,993
that you may never pass
through the gates of heaven

404
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,833
and that you and I may be separated
for all eternity?

405
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,070
Well, of course I care. Of course I do.

406
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,469
What do you think has kept me in limbo
all these years?

407
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,152
I am a neuter bee.

408
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,119
I'm a scientist, and I dare not study

409
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,751
for the fear of seeing more clearly
what is already as plain as day to me.

410
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,075
Do you not think that's torture enough?

411
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,913
I think you are at war with God,
Charles.

412
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,518
We both know
it is a battle you cannot win.

413
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,236
{sighs}

414
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,151
{children chatter excitedly}

415
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,080
- {Darwin} Give me the ball!
- No, you cheated!

416
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,594
- Curse you, woman!
- You cheated!

417
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,272
{Emma} Jetty!

418
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,471
{Darwin} Jetty, Jetty, Jetty!

419
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,599
{Emma shrieks}

420
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,670
- Were you never married, Broody?
- Myself? No.

421
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,513
He went off to Australia.
I missed my chance.

422
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,070
I shall never marry.

423
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,116
I know how men give you babies.

424
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,556
I sincerely hope you do not,
Annie Darwin!

425
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,635
Everybody step back
and look at the rock.

426
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,349
If you look at it, really look at it,
it can take us back through time.

427
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,591
See these greyish, muddy layers?

428
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,355
They were brought here
by quiet, patient, gentle rivers,

429
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,671
whereas these dramatic
sandstone deposits

430
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,955
are telling us of huge storms,

431
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,077
storms that came through here
millions of years ago

432
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,469
when Aunt Sarah was just a little girl

433
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,109
and Down Village
was a swamp full of dinosaurs.

434
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,794
- What's a dinosaur?
- It's a lizard...

435
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,316
- Professor Owen invented them.
- He didn't exactly invent them.

436
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,550
- They weren't real!
- Yes, they were.

437
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,756
Put some clothes on! You're going blue.

438
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:12,233
Look what I found! Spiny starfish!
Don't tell me.

439
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,675
Marthasterias gavials, look!

440
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,990
Glacial is.

441
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,277
{Annie} Whoo! Whoo!

442
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,991
I am Fuegian!

443
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,234
{yells}

444
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,039
I'm making custard!

445
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,717
{yells}

446
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,511
{Annie} He did, he told me!

447
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,593
{Innes} It is not fair to the other
children, nor to Annie herself,

448
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,875
that her head be filled
with these ideas.

449
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,758
- But Daddy said!
- I will leave you to deal with this.

450
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,558
- He did, he told me!
- {Emma} Hush.

451
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,232
{Innes} Goodbye, Annie.

452
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,390
- {Annie sobs}
- What happened?

453
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,471
Nothing.

454
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,994
Your knees.
What happened to your knees?

455
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,640
Reverend Innes
had to have words with her.

456
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,312
What happened to her knees?

457
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,598
Reverend Innes sent me to the corner
and made me kneel on rock salt. {sobs}

458
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,953
- Why?
- I said there were dinosaurs,

459
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,873
and he said there weren't.
But you found them!

460
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,918
- Where's my coat?
- Take her to the kitchen, will you?

461
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,991
{Darwin} Where's my coat?

462
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,030
He told her to kneel until she repented,

463
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,396
so the marks are a result
of her own stubbornness.

464
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,632
- She contradicted him repeatedly.
- Listen to yourself. Emma!

465
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,110
How dare he torture our children
for expressing the truth?

466
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,998
- It is not the truth as he sees it.
- Damn how he sees it!

467
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,513
{Annie sobs}

468
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,550
Must our children be revolutionaries
at nine years of age?

469
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,110
He is teaching them to deny
the evidence of their own senses.

470
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,191
No more than I have told them
at bedtime.

471
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,033
It is the instruction
of our parents and grandparents.

472
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,680
It's what all of the village believe,
or try to.

473
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,718
Charles, Reverend Innes
is a dear friend and neighbour.

474
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,999
Please, do not set yourself against him.

475
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,151
I beg you.

476
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,519
For you.

477
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,472
Not for him.

478
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:39,399
¶ All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small

479
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,395
¶ All things wise and wonderful

480
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,271
¶ The Lord God made them all

481
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,632
Let us pray.

482
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,637
Lord God... we know the world
is governed by Thy plan...

483
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,999
...extending to the merest creatures
Thou hast made,

484
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,551
such that even a sparrow falls
not to the ground without Thy will.

485
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,752
Teach us that all misfortune,
all sickness and death,

486
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,958
all the trials and miseries
of which we daily complain...

487
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,316
...are intended for our good...

488
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,036
...being not the whims
of an uncaring universe...

489
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,639
...but the corrections of a wise...
and affectionate parent.

490
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,597
Teach us this in Thy name, O Lord.

491
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,633
- Amen.
- {all} Amen.

492
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,435
The lesson today is taken
from the Book of Genesis.

493
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,717
- Chapter one, verses 26 to 30.
- Sorry.

494
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,076
- {Darwin} Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
- And God said,

495
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,233
"Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness."

496
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,796
"And let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea,

497
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,032
and over the fowl of the air, and over
all the cattle and over all the Earth,

498
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,829
and over every creeping thing
that creped upon the Earth."

499
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,471
{Darwin} Dearest Emma, last night
you said I was at war with God,

500
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,632
but truly it is nothing so dramatic
as a war,

501
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,748
just a silent struggle with myself
extended over a thousand afternoons.

502
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,157
The loss of religious faith
is a slow and fragile process,

503
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,231
like the raising of continents.

504
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,635
What can I say to you except that
the process now seems complete?

505
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,711
{birds sing}

506
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,111
{birds sing}

507
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,278
{bird caws}

508
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,791
{bird chirps}

509
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,712
{bird caws}

510
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,991
{bird chirps}

511
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,071
{wings flap}

512
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,197
- {whispers} What are we looking at?
- See the rabbit?

513
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,036
Stay very still.

514
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,869
{rabbit squeals}

515
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,154
{Jetty} Make it stop.

516
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,038
Quickly, Daddy, make it stop.

517
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,554
- Quickly!
- Jetty. Jetty, darling.

518
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,393
- Daddy, make it stop.
- Ssh. Darling girl.

519
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,516
- {cries}
- Dear girl.

520
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,435
- Dear sweet girl.
- It's not fair! {sobs}

521
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,478
- It's not fair!
- I'm sorry.

522
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,993
- {Jetty} Not fair.
- {Darwin} It's not fair.

523
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,958
Jetty, it has to be that way.

524
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,710
The fox has to eat the rabbit,
otherwise the fox's babies will die.

525
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,751
It's the balance of things.

526
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,950
Come on, little duck. Give us a smile.

527
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,035
{laughs}

528
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,510
- {children laugh}
- {piano music}

529
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,119
{Darwin}
Dear Hooker, I am finally decided.

530
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,351
I think I owe it to my children

531
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,671
to at least have the courage
of my own convictions.

532
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,673
My title will be
"On the Origin of Species",

533
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,673
and I shall endeavour
to keep God out of it,

534
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,799
although no doubt
He will see it as a personal attack.

535
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,912
Nothing is easier
than to admit the truth

536
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,991
of the universal struggle for life,

537
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,550
or more difficult
than to constantly bear this in mind.

538
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,437
I shall devote my first chapter
to variations under domestication,

539
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,911
wherein we will see
how great is the power of man

540
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,195
in accumulating slight variations.

541
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,239
I will then pass on to see how natural
selection causes much extinction...

542
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,029
...of the less-improved forms of life.

543
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,390
- {Emma} Charles?
- Yes?

544
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,269
What is Lewis making?

545
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,070
He's making a water tower
like the one they have at Malvern.

546
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,591
The writing's not been going well, so I
thought I might try my own water cure.

547
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,836
You're still angry with me.

548
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,355
I can always tell by your playing.

549
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,474
Not angry. Sad.

550
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,671
{plays slow introduction}

551
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,071
{plays softly}

552
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,917
{plays loudly}

553
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,112
Pull.

554
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,711
{Darwin} The face of nature
may be compared to a yielding surface

555
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,758
with 10,000 sharp wedges
packed close together

556
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,149
and then driven inwards
by incessant blows.

557
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,630
Sometimes one wedge being struck
and then another with great force.

558
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,712
The mind cannot possibly grasp
the full meaning of the term

559
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,518
a hundred million years.

560
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,116
It cannot add up and perceive the full
effects of many slight variations.

561
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,751
We forget how largely these songsters
or their eggs or their nestlings

562
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,877
are destroyed
by birds and beasts of prey.

563
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,918
Thus, over tens of thousands
of generations,

564
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,673
tiny variations accumulate.

565
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,274
Organs change their very function.

566
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,477
The female sexual organ
becomes a cement gland.

567
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:22,714
Limbs become blind feelers
or fall away entirely.

568
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,712
What was once a free-swimming creature

569
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:31,591
finds itself glued by its head
to a rock, blindly flailing for food.

570
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,636
Papa!

571
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,711
{gasps}

572
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,631
{gasps}

573
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,751
{clock ticks}

574
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,834
Why is sweating
supposed to be good for you?

575
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,559
Because it gets rid of the poisons
in your blood.

576
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,910
- I thought you didn't believe in sin.
- I don't.

577
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,309
Not in the way Reverend Innes
understands it, anyway.

578
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,198
Then why are you afraid
of going to hell?

579
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,316
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

580
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,550
- You think you deserve it.
- No, I don't.

581
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,155
Of course I don't.
What could possibly make you think that?

582
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,198
Because you think
you should never have had me.

583
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,352
Oh, for God's sake, girl.

584
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,794
Oh, I don't have to listen
to this nonsense.

585
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,873
You're cruel. You're just being cruel.
The girl's gone mad.

586
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,475
That's why you won't talk to Mama
any more.

587
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,438
Enough of this. I talk to her.
Of course I talk to her.

588
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,875
Not about the important things.
Not about me!

589
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,635
- Why must everything be about you?
- That's what you won't talk about.

590
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,156
- What?
- How you think you're responsible.

591
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,751
Get out of here.

592
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,348
You get out of here. Get out of here.

593
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,398
You said honesty was
the most important thing in the world.

594
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,995
If you won't be honest, I won't
come again. It'll serve you right!

595
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,959
Get out! Please, get out! Get out!

596
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,435
You have not been well for months now.

597
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,590
I'll be fine. I'm fine.

598
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,549
- Will you talk to John Innes?
- What about?

599
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,315
- Whatever it is that ails you.
- What is he now, exactly? What is he?

600
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,791
- He's a physician, is he?
- Yes. A physician of souls, anyway.

601
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,393
{scoffs}

602
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,314
{Emma} Talk to him as a friend.
You used to be such friends.

603
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,830
I think he can help you.

604
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,231
{quiet chatter}

605
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,434
{wings flap}

606
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,511
{pigeons coo}

607
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,638
- {faint chatter}
- {man} Mr Darwin? Excuse me.

608
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,836
Little 'un coming through.
Ah, Mr Darwin.

609
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,435
I was just explaining to Mr Goodman
about your interest in breeding.

610
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,953
Oh, good. Excellent.

611
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,079
Mr Goodman is our foremost pigeon
fancier in all of southern England.

612
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,631
I swear, he can give you any beak
or plumage within four generations.

613
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,508
- {Darwin} What's your secret?
- {Goodman} I interbreed them.

614
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,989
Brother and sister, cousin with cousin.

615
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,196
It's the fastest way
to alter the strain.

616
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,990
There's a danger that you'll weaken it,
but a gentleman like yourself,

617
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,311
I'm sure you can afford
to lose a few chicks, eh?

618
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,391
{laughter}

619
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,279
{doctor}
Now, plenty of rest, young lady.

620
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,312
{Broody} Down you go.

621
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,233
Keep her warm.

622
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,550
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Goodbye, Annie.

623
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,758
- {Annie} Goodbye.
- {footsteps}

624
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,392
Unfortunately,
if we let them run wild on the beach,

625
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,029
we have to expect the consequences,
do we not, Mrs Darwin?

626
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,908
- So, increase the calomel to twice...
- I will not give her any more of it.

627
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,150
- Why not?
- She's been taking it for weeks.

628
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,118
- Can you not see she's not...
- It is chloride of mercury.

629
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,192
- I've prescribed it often in babies.
- Not to any of mine.

630
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,829
- If she would submit to being bled...
- Please, no.

631
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,712
- I will write to Dr Gully again.
- The hydro therapist?

632
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,109
I have found his treatments
very effective.

633
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,351
- No matter that they defy logic?
- Logic isn't everything.

634
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,431
Clearly not.

635
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,478
- I'll see myself out. Good day, madam.
- Good day.

636
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,109
{door closes}

637
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,714
I should take her to Malvern
to be treated as I was.

638
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,199
It is better she's here.

639
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,829
She needs her family.
She needs love and rest.

640
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,192
She'll get well.

641
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,711
One more week.

642
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,360
We'll watch her for one more week.
Alright?

643
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,519
Thank you.

644
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,868
{clock ticks}

645
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,391
{muffled cries}

646
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,150
Papa!

{children chatter}

653
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,470
Post for you, sir.

654
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,630
This one's from the Spice Islands.

655
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,512
{door closes}

656
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,271

657
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,031
{chuckles}

658
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,271
{birds sing}

659
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,271
{man} Charles.

660
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,353
Charles, my old friend, there you are.
May I join you?

661
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,751
Yes. Yes, of course.

662
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,955
Mrs Darwin has told me
about the book you are writing.

663
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,316
Oh, no, no, not any more.
Thank goodness.

664
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,277
{Innes} You mean you finished it?

665
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,271
It's been finished for me, actually.

666
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,831
A Mr Alfred Russell Wallace
has arrived independently

667
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,354
at exactly the same opinion.

668
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,231
Expressed in a... {chuckles}

669
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,755
In a mere 20 pages.

670
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,631
Now, there's brevity for you.

671
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,117
I had covered 250 so far
and come to a dead end,

672
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:24,878
so whilst having wasted 20 years
on the project, I am at least rid of it.

673
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,199
Well.

674
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,553
Well...

675
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,552
...the Lord moves in mysterious ways.

676
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,190
Hmm, yes, He does, doesn't He?

677
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,835
You know, I was remarking
only the other day

678
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,913
how He has endowed us
in all of His blessed generosity

679
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,390
with not one but 900 species
of intestinal worm,

680
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,950
each with its own unique method
of infiltrating the mucosa

681
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,793
and burrowing through
to the bloodstream.

682
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,953
And on the love that he shows
for butterflies

683
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,431
by inventing a wasp that lays its eggs
inside the living flesh of caterpillars.

684
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,752
I have said on many occasions, it is not
for us to speculate at His reason.

685
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,717
No, we can leave that to Mr Wallace.

686
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,679
Shall I advise him to stay abroad,
do you think?

687
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,519
With his opinions,
if he shows his face around here,

688
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,319
he may be required
to kneel on rock salt.

689
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,030
I always valued our friendship.

690
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,630
Until now, I regarded you
as one of those rare mortals

691
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,952
with whom one could disagree
and yet feel no shade of animosity.

692
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:01,437
Sadly, that feeling is...
no longer reciprocated.

693
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,549
What?

694
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,551
I'm forestalled by Wallace.

695
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,995
What have I done? What?

696
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:34,473
What possible... What possible reason
could you have to be angry at me?

697
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,839
Annie.

698
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,355
Annie! Annie! Come here! Come back!

699
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,273
Come back here now!

700
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,389
I am your father! You...
You come back here! What?

701
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,268
What did I do?
What did I do to you? What?

702
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,869
Annie! C-Come here! Come back!

703
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,595
What did I do to you?
Please! Annie, please!

704
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,150
Come here! Annie! Annie! Come here!

705
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,032
Get rid of them.

706
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,110
Get rid of all of them.

707
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,718
Come on. Get out!

708
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,791
Get out!

709
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,633
Go! Come on!

710
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,676
Get out! Go!

711
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,751
Go!

712
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,991
{grunts}

713
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,229
Mr Darwin. Mr... Mr Darwin.

714
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,470
- {Darwin grunts}
- Mr Darwin, sir!

715
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,438
- {grunts}
- Mr Darwin?

716
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,592
I'll have Lewis dismantle it, sir.

717
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,274
Now, Mr Darwin,
I'll send for Dr Holland.

718
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,831
God, no.

719
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,111
God damn it.

720
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,191
Damn it all to hell.

721
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,231
{Par slow} Mr Darwin?

722
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,600
Help me here! Help me here!

723
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,550
{Dr Holland} So, increase the calomel
to twice a day.

724
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,155
- {Emma} Yes, of course.
- Keep him warm, plenty of rest...

725
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,190
I think Papa's going to die, too.

726
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,434
{footsteps}

727
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:11,039
Oh. Hello, Hooker. Hello.

728
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,789
Still talking.

729
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,873
That's good. Word had reached London
you'd suffered an apoplectic stroke.

730
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,599
Your enemies are celebrating
at the Athenaeum.

731
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,432
I have no enemies.

732
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,710
- This is the Wallace letter?
- Yes.

733
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,792
Well, he has 20 pages.

734
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,155
You have a whole book,
or at least half of one.

735
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,959
I intend to extract the other
even if it kills us both.

736
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,156
Have you been talking to Huxley again?

737
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,994
No. Had I been, he'd be here himself
with a cat-o'-nine-tails. Up you come.

738
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,119
No, I cannot. I know not what ails me,
but it's more than I can endure.

739
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,034
Bosh! You have had this illness
as long as I have known you.

740
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,951
It's worse in times of overwork,

741
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,953
but it has nothing to do with your soul,
wherever that resides now.

742
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,315
- Go and get yourself treated.
- I cannot.

743
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,755
Believe me, you do have enemies.

744
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,718
I'll bet half the nation
would see you burnt at the stake

745
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,997
if they knew what you were writing,
but you have friends, too,

746
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,389
and all of us
are fighting the same battle.

747
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,392
And we can win this in our lifetimes.
We have to win this.

748
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,678
I implore you, go to Malvern,
take your blessed water cure,

749
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,876
come back and win it for us.

750
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,434
- She's nearly ready.
- Thank you. Move those quickly, please.

751
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,511
- I want to come with you.
- No.

752
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,990
- Malvern's not so far.
- Par slow! It's two days by coach.

753
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,992
- What if the baby comes early?
- They have doctors there.

754
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,629
- Your job is here with the children.
- They also need their father.

755
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,349
I can't care about the other children
now. I can only care about Annie!

756
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,151
{Broody} Mind her shawl,
make sure it's tucked in.

757
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,678
Alright, thank you. Thank you.
Alright, little frog.

758
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,070
- I made these. It's Annie's favourite.
- Thank you.

759
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,789
You will see your mama
when you're well again.

760
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,871
- Broody, get aboard.
- No! No!

761
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,669
- Say goodbye, now.
- No, I don't want to say goodbye!

762
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,753
- Say goodbye now.
- No, I'm going with you.

763
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,354
I'm going with you.
Wait there! Wait for me!

764
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,671
{Jetty sobs}

765
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,596
{carriage door closes}

766
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,638
{Darwin} Go! Go now.

767
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,358
{driver} Walk on.

768
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,711
{sobs}

769
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,231
{Emma cries}

770
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,271
{approaching footsteps}

771
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,916
Mr Darwin, old friend. Mr Darwin.

772
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,958
How long has it been?
I haven't clapped eyes on you since...

773
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:45,638
Well... So, what have we now?
What have we now?

774
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,349
Tongue? Hmm-hm.

775
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,715
Shirt up. Let me feel your liver.

776
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,074
Right. Up.

777
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,109
Pulse hectic, tongue furred,
liver tender and enlarged.

778
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,910
And obviously you've been exercising
your brain every hour that God gave you.

779
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,355
- I have been writing a book.
- Madness!

780
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,079
There are far too many of those already.

781
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,594
- Are you sleeping?
- Poorly.

782
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,514
And I suppose never taking
the 50c dilution of Chelidonium?

783
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:26,594
I had my carpenter build a water tower.
It no longer has any effect.

784
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,717
Of course not!
Your carpenter isn't a hydro therapist.

785
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,429
- What on Earth possessed you?
- I feared I was dying.

786
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,876
Oh, come, come, come.
We shall not have that talk here.

787
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,476
A sharp spinal scrub,
cold douche daily at 7:00am,

788
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,028
and sweating by the lamp.

789
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,998
No red meat, no reading,
no mental agitation of any kind.

790
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:54,279
We shall soon have you right, Mr Darwin.
We shall soon have you right.

791
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,631
{scrubbing}

792
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:42,553
Papa? I think I'm feeling better now.
Honestly.

793
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,472
Papa!

794
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,639
Sir, I kneel before You in all humility.

795
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:35,510
If it is in Your power, God,
to save her...

796
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,718
...then I will believe in You
for the rest of my days.

797
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,874
Take me, if You must take someone,
but not her. She...

798
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,313
She's such a good little girl, you see.
She...

799
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,910
I ask this in the name
of Your child and mine

800
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,275
and in the name of all children.

801
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,792
Thank you. Amen.

802
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,476
{doctor} With what do you most
associate these symptoms? Eating?

803
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,753
Strong emotion? Physical exertion?

804
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,751
Any particular action?

805
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,396
- Is... Is memory an action?
- Memory of what?

806
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,439
- My daughter.
- Of course.

807
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,675
You must accept
there was nothing more to be done.

808
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,997
Oh, dear fellow... she is in heaven.

809
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,950
Yes, that's what my wife believes.

810
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,914
It is a great consolation to her.

811
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,877
But not you?

812
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,680
She and I are divided on it.

813
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,672
- Were you always?
- No.

814
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,038
Only since Annie died.

815
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,111
{driver} Whoa, there.

816
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:34,876
Charles, I'm...
I'm so very sorry about Annie.

817
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,236
- Where is she?
- In the Lady Chapel.

818
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,311
Thank you. Thank you.

819
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,591
{Emma whispers}

820
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,393
{Darwin} Since that time, she has sought
refuge in religion, and I in science.

821
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:28,199
{doctor} Has this division...
affected your marital relations?

822
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,394
We have none any more... to speak of.

823
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,950
Perhaps that's for the best.

824
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,911
Meaning?

825
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,151
Our last baby...

826
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,958
Baby Ch... Baby Charlie.
He barely survived beyond infancy and...

827
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,471
{sobs}

828
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,195
Are you familiar
with the writings of de Quincy?

829
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,669
Yes, I... I've read him.

830
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,711
I have no time for the man.

831
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,634
He maintains that certain thoughts
can reside in our mind...

832
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,996
...without us being aware of them.

833
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,912
They then may manifest as boils

834
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,471
and fainting spells... and ghosts.

835
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,912
It's po... It's possible, yes.

836
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,709
Annie is buried here in Malvern,
is she not?

837
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,028
- Yes.
- And have you yet visited the grave?

838
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,399
- I really do not wish to discuss this.
- Of course...

839
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,517
- What possible bearing can it have?
- It has every bearing.

840
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,309
That is your opinion. Your treatments
have been effective. I feel cured.

841
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,550
- I think not, sir.
- {slams door}

842
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,596
I think you're not yet cured.

843
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,758
- Do you have faith, Mr Darwin?
- What?

844
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:20,631
You say you take no comfort
from religion, but do you have faith?

845
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:29,353
Until you do, all the waters in
the world will not be the cure of you.

846
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,191
{door closes}

847
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,271
{birds sing}

848
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,751
{mutters}

849
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,869
Annie?

850
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,119
Annie! Annie!

851
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,233
Annie!

852
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,315
Annie! {pants}

853
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,038
Annie!

854
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,474
- {door opens}
- {Darwin} Hello?

855
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,152
Hello?

856
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,273
Hello? Hello?

857
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,316
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

858
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,073
I'm Mr Darwin.
I lodged here some time ago.

859
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,549
Room number 12, wasn't it?

860
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,631
Yes, it was.

861
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,234
I would only be ten minutes or so.

862
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,397
First floor.

863
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,914
- Last room on the right.
- Yes, I remember.

864
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,871
Thank you.

865
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,832
I have the embrocating.

866
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,788
- Does she want for anything else?
- No, I'm sure that will do admirably.

867
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,713
Alright. Alright, little one.

868
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:35,273
Here we go. Now, then.

869
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,151
Just rub this on.

870
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,554
- How's that? Better?
- Yes.

871
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,991
{Darwin} Dearest Emma, I think it best
for you to know how each day passes.

872
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,431
Doctor Gully's treatments
are having some effect at last.

873
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,038
I will write again tomorrow,
but in the meantime...

874
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,112
The surgeon came today
to draw off Annie's water.

875
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,151
This did not hurt her,
and seemed to give much relief.

876
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,552
I asked if there was
any immediate threat to her life,

877
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,518
but he believes
she has turned the corner.

878
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:18,231
My Emma, Annie rallied yesterday.

879
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,277
For a moment, I was foolish
with delight, but now, suddenly,

880
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,033
our dear child
has taken a turn for the worse.

881
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,795
This last attack was first thought
to be of the smallest importance

882
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,589
but rapidly assumed the form
of a low and dreadful fever.

883
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,149
She talks a great deal,
but we can seldom make out anything.

884
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,515
Look, Mama, I'm a general!

885
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,110
Much of what she says
we cannot make out

886
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,316
from the roughness of her poor mouth.

887
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,238
- We sponged her with water and vinegar.
- There we are.

888
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,676
- Made her sweet with chloride of lime.
- Alright.

889
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,911
Gully thinks our poor, sweet child
is in imminent danger.

890
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,798
Is that better, my darling?
Is that better?

891
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,871
Beautifully good.

892
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,950
I'm making custard.

893
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,115
My darling Emma, I miss you, terribly.
More now than ever.

894
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,433
I often think of the precious looks
Annie gives you.

895
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,193
You were always
the tenders of human beings to her

896
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,953
and comfort her so on all occasions.

897
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:35,636
This dreadful alternation
of hope and no hope sickens the soul.

898
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,633
I feel we must prepare ourselves
for the worst.

899
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,635
{Annie breathes with difficulty}

900
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,196
Tell me about Jenny.

901
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,711
What about Jenny?

902
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,553
Ab... About how she dies.

903
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,068
Please, Papa. I like it.

904
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,519
Well...
what the keeper told me was this.

905
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:25,634
When she was very sick
with pneumonia, lying very still...

906
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,111
...he tried to feed her with a spoon.

907
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,153
But she shook her head
and she looked at him

908
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,593
as if to say...

909
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,037
..."That's very sweet of you. Really."

910
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,550
"We're beyond that now."

911
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:57,673
And the keeper was much moved
by the gentleness of the little ape.

912
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,756
And as he bent down to comfort her,

913
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,513
she brought her arms
up around his neck...

914
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,197
...and looked into his eyes
in the most human fashion.

915
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,789
And then she laid her head
against him...

916
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,351
...and died.

917
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,472
{Darwin sobs bitterly}

918
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:16,676
Oh, my darling girl, my darling girl!

919
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,518
{sobs bitterly}

920
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,320
{distant piano music}

921
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,031
{music gets louder}

922
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,554
- {stops playing}
- {Darwin} Sorry.

923
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:10,313
So sorry I startled you.

924
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,995
Goodness, Charles. Take off your coat.

925
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,799
- You're dripping wet.
- Emma, we need to talk.

926
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,071
I went back to Worcester Road.

927
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,637
I saw Annie.

928
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,111
{gasps} You're hurting my arm.

929
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,272
- I need to make you understand...
- I do not want to hear it.

930
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,477
- I am glad you're feeling better.
- You're not listening.

931
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,154
I need you to listen
or you will never understand.

932
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,391
I understand perfectly.
Do you think that I am deaf and blind?

933
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,955
You've lived with her and spoken
with her every day since she died.

934
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,076
She is more real to you than we are.

935
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,111
- She is dead, Charles.
- I know she's dead.

936
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,191
She is dead!

937
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,794
What in God's name is wrong with you?

938
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,111
Why can you not leave our poor girl
in her grave?

939
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,919
You're the one
who wants to keep her alive,

940
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,639
but on a cloud,
dancing with little fairies.

941
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,871
- I will not listen to this!
- In a night shift and snowy wings!

942
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,996
Is that how her death was for you, Emma?

943
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,197
- Something gutted of darkness?
- Get away from me.

944
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,475
Away from you?
There is a gulf between us!

945
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:20,916
We're like some, some survivors
of some shipwreck.

946
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,709
Yes! Yes, because of you!
You've torn everything apart!

947
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,076
- How? How? How?
- With your cruel theories!

948
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:31,038
With the truth, Emma!
Just with the truth!

949
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,237
Open the door! Open the...
Open the door!

950
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,754
Open this door! Open it!

951
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,148
What do you want from me?

952
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,231
I want us to be honest with each other.

953
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,389
About what?

954
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:49,109
About this... nagging belief
that you have nurtured.

955
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,630
- That what?
- That I killed her.

956
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,595
- I never said that.
- But you think it, so you must say it.

957
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,989
And say everything else that follows,

958
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,959
that I should have kept her warm
that day on the beach, that...

959
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,631
...I should never have taken her
to Malvern without you.

960
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,553
I should have waited for you.
I... I should have.

961
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,996
These are your thoughts, Charles.

962
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,431
They are not mine.

963
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,551
I was on the beach.

964
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,831
And I let you go.

965
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,029
I knew, when you left for Malvern...

966
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,439
...that I would never see her again.

967
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,431
And I hated you.

968
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:51,354
I hated you for taking her, Charles.

969
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,071
But I was her mother.

970
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:01,151
And what was I thinking?
I could have insisted.

971
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,158
I should have followed you up there.

972
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,991
I let her go.

973
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,431
That's the truth.

974
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,271
And more than anything...

975
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,071
...I have...

976
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:32,197
...hated... myself.

977
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,511
{sobs}

978
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,231
Perhaps...

979
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:53,352
- Perhaps we should never have married.
- {sobs}

980
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,351
Our blood was too close.

981
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,271
{sighs}

982
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:12,071
You see, Emma... I thought
that we were making the perfect child.

983
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,513
But perhaps instead we endowed her
with the weakness that killed her.

984
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:39,188
I just... wanted to be with you
so very much.

985
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,796
The fact... of it is...

986
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,276
...knowing everything I now know...

987
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,514
...I would marry you again tomorrow,
my love.

988
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,589
{Darwin sobs}

989
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,071
{birds sing}

990
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:58,356
{Darwin} The affinities of all beings
of the same class

991
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,750
have sometimes been represented
by a great tree.

992
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,150
The green and budding twigs
may represent existing species,

993
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,595
and those produced
during each former year

994
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,752
may represent the long succession
of extinct species.

995
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:14,355
So, I believe it has been
with the great Tree of Life,

996
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:19,036
which fills with its dead and broken
branches the crust of the Earth,

997
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,509
while covering the surface with its...

998
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,910
The frameworks of bones have been
the same in the hand of a man,

999
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,310
wing of a bat, fin of a porpoise
and leg of a horse

1000
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,836
at once explain themselves
on the theory of descent

1001
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,990
with slow and slight successive...

1002
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,152
It is interesting to contemplate
an entangled bank,

1003
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,390
clothed with many plants of many kinds,

1004
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,439
with birds singing on the bushes,
with various insects flitting about

1005
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,557
and with worms
crawling through the damp earth

1006
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,916
and to reflect that these
elaborately constructed forms,

1007
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,037
so different from each other
and dependent upon each other

1008
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:58,797
in so complex a manner, have all been
produced by laws acting around us.

1009
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,473
{Emma talks in the distance}

1010
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,235
"Advancing gently forward over
my breast, came almost up to my chin,

1011
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:13,393
and bending my eyes downwards
as much as I could, I quivered."

1012
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

1013
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:20,474
I was wondering
if I might, might take over.

1014
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:32,031
{grunts} Alright.

1015
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,318
- Where were you?
- {turns pages}

1016
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,870
"I perceived it to be a human creature
not six inches high."

1017
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:44,110
{Jetty} Not the book.

1018
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,589
Please, a true story.

1019
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,111
Like you did with Annie.

1020
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,152
{closes book}

1021
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,319
Alright. Let me think.

1022
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,748
Did I ever tell you
about my riding with gauchos?

1023
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,912
- Yes.
- {both} Yes.

1024
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,310
Or the time our ship was struck
by Saint Elmo's fire?

1025
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,868
- {all} Yes.
- My attempt to climb the Andes?

1026
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:23,951
- {all} Yes.
- Earthquakes?

1027
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,156
- {all} Yes.
- Tidal waves?

1028
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,915
- Really? I did?
- {all} Yes.

1029
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,470
Goodness gracious,
I think I've told you everything.

1030
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:37,911
And yet I fancy

1031
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,391
I have never told you
about the giant sloth of Punta Alta.

1032
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,468
{all} No.

1033
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,074
Alright, then.
Millions and millions of years ago,

1034
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:54,039
in a rich and verdant land
that we now call Argentina...

1035
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,475
...there lived a mammal.

1036
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,988
There lived a mammal
as large as an elephant,

1037
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:09,437
as gentle as a lemur and as slow
as an incredibly slow snail.

1038
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,034
- {kisses Jetty}
- And he lived a happy life

1039
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,635
watching the slow green march
of the passing seasons.

1040
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,151
{geese honk}

1041
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,078
{plays piano}

1042
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:41,114
Er... I've finished.

1043
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,475
- I've finished.
- {stops playing}

1044
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,953
- You decide.
- About what?

1045
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:54,078
Well, about what should be done with it.

1046
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:58,836
Someone needs to take God's side
in all of this.

1047
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,514
I'd much rather it was you than Innes.

1048
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,717
Supposing I think
it should be destroyed?

1049
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,999
Well... then you must do
what you think is right.

1050
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,271
Read it first.

1051
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,228
- Emma?
- {chickens cluck}

1052
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,635
Well, you said it was my decision.

1053
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,839
Emma, where... Where are you going?

1054
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,471
To John Murray publishers.

1055
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,911
Do I have it right?

1056
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,115
Yes.

1057
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:15,598
And so... you have finally
made an accomplice of me.

1058
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,431
May God forgive us both.

1059
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,949
- Good morning, Jim.
- Morning, Mr Darwin, sir.

1060
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:52,600
- That parcel for me?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1061
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,309
{Darwin} Thus, from the war of nature,
from famine and death,

1062
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,710
the most exalted object
we are capable of conceiving,

1063
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,793
namely the production of higher animals,
directly follows.

1064
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,959
There is grandeur in this view of life,

1065
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,554
that whilst this planet
has gone cycling on

1066
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:20,033
according to the fixed law of gravity,
from so simple a beginning,

1067
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:24,193
endless forms,
most beautiful and most wonderful,

1068
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:28,910
have been, and are being, evolved.

1069
