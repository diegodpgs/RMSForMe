00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,499

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,500
90...

26
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Burt. Shut that
bloody thing up.

27
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,099
Do you know what time
it is? Burt!

28
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,199
Burt! You stupid old bastard!

29
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,199
What do you think
you're doing?

30
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,199
Sorry George,
what did you say?

31
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,999
Do you know what time it is?

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,699
I'm sorry, I've got a heck
of a lot to get done today.

33
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,800
And you know what they say.
"The early bird catches the worm".

34
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Well, if you do this again,
one more time, I'm calling the cops.

35
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,599
And how about
mowing your lawns?

36
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Its a bloody disgrace
to the neighborhood.

37
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Oh, alright.

38
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Hi, kid.

39
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,999
Here we are, the...

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,699
perfect recipe...

41
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,499
two of Chevy...

42
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
one of Ford.

43
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I think those '36 Chevy pistons...

44
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,634
must have a touch of titanium
or something in them.

45
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:55,599
They come up real good,
you know.

46
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,399
Hey the kettle's boiling.

47
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Make yourself useful,
make some tea.

48
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,599
Can we have a biscuit too?

49
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,299
- What?
- Can I have a Gingernut?

50
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Yeah, you know where they are,
help yourself.

51
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Now you stay over there,
stay there.

52
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,599
- Right.
- What are you doing for Christmas, Burt?

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,699
Christmas? I don't know.
Why?

54
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,799
Are you angling
for a present or something?

55
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,199
- No, I wondered if you were going away.
- No...

56
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,099
no time for Christmas, lad.
Got a lot of work to do.

57
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,299
I only managed twenty seven
test runs this year.

58
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,599
You know, twenty four on the beach
and three on the road.

59
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,999
All illegal like.

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,699
I was going a bit over the speed limit,
I'll have to admit.

61
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,399
- How fast were you going?
- I don't know, I haven't a clue.

62
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,299
Thats why I have to get up
to Bonneville.

63
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Found out how fast she will go.

64
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,199
Now, there you go.

65
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,299
Got to get the piston out
of the mould...

66
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,399
and Bob's your uncle.

67
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,799
Right, this is...

68
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,399
the last part
of the operation now.

69
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,199
To chill the metal.

70
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,200
It heat treats it.
Right, watch yourself.

71
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,299
Thats where I got the water
for the kettle from.

72
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,100
Well, you know, it gives the tea
a nice tang of titanium, doesn't it?

73
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,299
Now this bloke,
he once asked me...

74
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,400
"How do you heat treat your pistons?"
And I said: "I don't, mate"...

75
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:58,500
I just, you know, bung them
in cold water and Bob's your uncle".

76
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,399
And he said:
"Well, thats the heat treatment"...

77
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,500
and he just laughed and
shook his head and walked away like.

78
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,399
Well, look this could be
the perfect piston.

79
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,399
It blooming well ought to be,
I've made hundreds of them.

80
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Look at them all up there,
all blown to smithereens.

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,799
- You made all those?
- Yeah, I did. Look perfect.

82
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,199
Beautiful, no inclusions see?

83
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,500
Now Tommy, does your mother have
a carving knife I could borrow?

84
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:29,099
Carving knife? Yeah?

85
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Yeah.
I need a good sharp knife.

86
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,999
Hang on.

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,899
- Thomas, what are you up to?
- Nothing, Mum.

88
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,099
Can I have some bread
and peanut butter?

89
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Ok, but make sure you put everything
away when you've finished.

90
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,100
Sorry about that.

91
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,299
Tom.

92
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,300
- Don't forget the wood.
- No, Mum.

93
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,399
Right.

94
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,599
I hope to get as much...

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,299
rubber off as possible.

96
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,299
It has to be perfectly bald,
like that, you see.

97
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,099
- Why's that?
- Well, at high speed...

98
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,699
the centrifugal force...

99
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,499
expands the tyre and...

100
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,500
it rubs against
the frame of the bike.

101
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Have to be careful not to cut
through the cords though.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,899
- Why do you pee on your lemon tree?
- What?

103
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Why do you pee on your
lemon tree?

104
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,799
- Who says I do that?
- Mum says she sees you...

105
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,499
every morning and
she goes on and on about it.

106
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,499
Does she?

107
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,800
Well, its good for it. You shouldn't
waste anything in this world, sonny.

108
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,399
- Well, I'd better be off home.
- Alright then.

109
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,899
Mum gets a bit cross if
I stay over here too long.

110
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,999
She does.

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,400
- Are you finished with the knife?
- Not yet, I'll drop it by later.

112
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,999
No, don't do that,
I'll pick it up after school tomorrow.

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,499
Alright.

114
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,500
- Bye.
- Cheerio.

115
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,199
- Burt Munro.
- Yeah.

116
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,799
I believe you have
my carving knife.

117
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,800
- Oh yes.
- And my sharpener.

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hang on, here we are.

119
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Well, thanks a lot, love.

120
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,299
G'day Frank. How are you?

121
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,099
Oh not bad, could be better,
could be worse.

122
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,399
I see your front tyre's going
a bit flat on you there, Burt.

123
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,099
Yeah, well, the good news is,
its only flat on the bottom.

124
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,034
I'll see you tomorrow night
for the fun and games.

125
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:12,299
I'll be a good one.

126
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,699
Hello, Fran.

127
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,700
- Give us the lot will you? The usual.
- One pension check. Coming up.

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,999
Fran...

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I want to ask you a question,
the answer to which is...

130
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,899
a definite yes.

131
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,699
- Alright, Fran?
- Alright.

132
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,799
Yes.

133
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,599
What is the question, Burt?

134
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Would you feel inclined to,
you know, accompany...

135
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,700
an impeccable young gentleman
to a local do tomorrow night?

136
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,699
You're asking me on a date,
Burt Munro?

137
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,499
Well, yeah, I suppose
I am actually, aren't I?

138
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
- Would you?
- You're on.

139
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,999
- Hello, son.
- Hey, Burt.

140
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,299
Thas disgusting.

141
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,499
It is, isn't it?

142
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,799
All dressed up
for the do tonight...

143
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,599
and I couldn't get
my best shoes on...

144
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,899
because my toe nails had grown
like oyster shells.

145
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,599
Alright...

146
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,599
this should do the trick.

147
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,199
There, look at that.

148
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Little twinkle toes.

149
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,500
- Thanks, Burt.
- Right on.

150
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,999
- Evening, Burt.
- Thank you...

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,499
- this is Fran.
- Hello, Fran.

152
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,099
Thank you very much.

153
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,799
- Hello, Duncan.
- Burt.

154
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Just going to say hello and be back
in a second, love, alright?

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,299
- How are you?
- Bike going well?

156
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,899
Yeah, not too bad.

157
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,399
- Happy birthday, Burt.
- Thanks a lot, mate.

158
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,199
This is a bit of
a surprise, isn't it?

159
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,699
Would you like to buy
a raffle ticket or two?

160
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,899
- Whats it for?
- Porky the Pig plus two dozen beers.

161
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,900
We're raising money to send
Burt to the USA. Our mate, Burt.

162
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,199
Hello. Come on and dance.

163
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,099
- Whas this? The twist?
- This is the twist. You know the twist?

164
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Come twist with me.

165
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,400
See you can twist.

166
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,399
- Thats it, thats it.
- This must be it, the atomic invasion.

167
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,599
Then the air clears
and the dust settles down.

168
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,899
You look outside,
have they leveled the town?

169
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,134
But there, in the yard...

170
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,199
so briskly alive...

171
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,799
stands Burt Munro's trusty...

172
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
old Indian Scout '45.

173
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,799
That was a wonderful
tribute to Burt.

174
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,899
Now come on Burt, we want you up
on stage, come on...

175
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,900
come on, up you come.

176
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,599
I hope all of you have bought
a raffle ticket tonight...

177
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,800
because we believe Burt will put
the Southland Motorcycle Club...

178
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:20,835
on the map.

179
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,799
Whats going on out there?

180
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,199
Get out of here.

181
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Oh, dear.

182
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,100
Well folks, it looks like
I've cracked it, I've um you know.

183
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,699
You Burt Munro?

184
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,099
- What did he say?
- I said, are you Burt Munro?

185
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,499
Are you looking for old Burt?

186
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,899
I don't know,
anyone seen Burt anywhere?

187
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,899
Anyone seen Burt?

188
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,399
- No, he's...
- You are, you're Burt Munro.

189
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,199
You're the old codger,
rides the Army Indian right?

190
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,199
That old joker.
Burt Munro. Yeah.

191
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,699
Yeah, thats me I think.

192
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,700
Now the, ah, young fella,
the army Indian is a real dog...

193
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,399
what I've got is the...

194
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,500
genuine article,
the 1920 V twin Scout.

195
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,800
- Thats the one with the pedals, right?
- Don't put up with that, Burt.

196
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,600
No, well. Well, I don't know what sort of
push bikes you monkeys came into town on...

197
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,500
but I know my old timer would trash
the backsides of whatever they are.

198
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,399
- I don't think so, granddad.
- No.

199
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Well, why don't you chaps
put your money where your mouth is?

200
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,400
You're on. You old coot.

201
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,334
- Looks like they've chickened out, Burt.
- What?

202
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:56,199
- Looks like they've chickened out.
- They're here.

203
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,200
They're here.

204
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Thats nice of them
to show up isn't it?

205
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,299
A hundred says
the Indian comes last.

206
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Right.

207
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,699
Come on, Burt.

208
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,499
Ready, steady...

209
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,500
go.

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,499
Come on, give me a push.

211
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,399
- Come on.
- Come on, Burt.

212
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Give me a push.
Come on, push hard.

213
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,099
Bugger it.

214
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Come on! Go!

215
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,899
Bugger!

216
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,999
Nice bike, granddad.

217
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Loser.

218
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,799
Thanks, fellas.

219
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,800
- Better luck next time.
- Better luck, Burt.

220
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,099
There you go.

221
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,100
- Well, thanks, love.
- Careful, its hot.

222
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,699
Well, at least I gave them
a good run for their money.

223
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,399
On the downward leg anyway.

224
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,934
Burt... Whats it going to cost
to get over to America?

225
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,399
Sorry, love.
What did you say?

226
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,199
How much is it gonna cost
to get over to America?

227
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,699
I don't know,
about two thousand I'm told.

228
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,199
And how much money
have you got now?

229
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,700
Apart from today's disaster
and the dough from last and you know...

230
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:59,099
the pension money
I've been saving...

231
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm about twelve hundred and 75 dollars,
United States dollars, I reckon.

232
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,999
Well, I could lend you some money.

233
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,900
Thats very kind of you Fran love, but no.
I couldn't do that love. No, thanks.

234
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,899
Well, there must be
something you can do.

235
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,899
Well, I haven't told anyone
else this, Fran, but...

236
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,600
I don't reckon I'll be gonna Bonneville.
I reckon not this year anyway and...

237
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,300
you know, seven hundred dollars
is a lot of money to find...

238
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,600
and the boat leaves in five days.

239
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,200
Except I would like to see
how fast she would really go...

240
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,500
before I fall off the perch as it were.
Before I ah, kicked the old bucket.

241
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,799
Hello, Lloyd.

242
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,299
Gidday, Burt.

243
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,599
Shame about the fall.

244
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,399
Well, I'm still
in one piece aren't I?

245
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,899
Good,
what are you having tonight?

246
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,499
Specialty of the house,
pea, pie and pud.

247
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,499
- Thats five bob.
- Alright.

248
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,199
Burt? Why don't you take out
a mortgage on your house?

249
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,099
- What house?
- Well, your property.

250
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,999
I mean its worth something.

251
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,199
Here you are.

252
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,599
Burt Munro,
look at the color of your hands.

253
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,234
- Whats the matter with them.
- You're gonna wash those mitts...

254
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:25,299
before you put them
anywhere near me.

255
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,300
There we are.

256
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,299
Wakee, wakee.

257
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,799
Time to rise...

258
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,799
and shine.

259
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,499
Burt, you're a sweetie.

260
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Got to get out of here before
the neighbors spot me.

261
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,799
Burt, this tastes a bit odd.

262
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,199
Its metallic.

263
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine

264
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,799
Oh, crikey!

265
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,299
What?

266
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,199
I've got a pain in my chest.

267
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
He's in the shed, hurry.

268
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Mum, Dad,
something's happened to Burt.

269
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,499
Burt, whats wrong with you?

270
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,399
I'll be alright Tommy,
don't worry about me.

271
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,400
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

272
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,900
What are you all staring at?
Dirty old men need love too.

273
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,799
- Mr. Munro.
- Hello.

274
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,599
So, whats the story, Doc?

275
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,700
- I'm sorry, its not good news.
- Oh, yeah. Well, fire away.

276
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,299
You've had an attack of angina.

277
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,899
You have arterial sclerosis.

278
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,499
And whats that?

279
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,299
Its a narrowing
of the arteries from the heart.

280
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,599
Oh, dear.

281
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,899
Yeah, I'm afraid there's not too much
we can do for you at your age...

282
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,199
other than suggesting you
take it easy.

283
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,599
Look if you have another attack,
pop one of these under your tongue...

284
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,899
let it dissolve
and then swallow the saliva.

285
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,599
The pain should be gone
in thirty seconds.

286
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,099
- Yeah, what do you call these things?
- Trinitrate pills.

287
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,399
Um better known as nitro glycerine.

288
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,834
- The stuff you blow things up with.
- Yes, but in much smaller quantities.

289
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:15,299
Alright.

290
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Will this have any affect on
me riding my bike?

291
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,499
Unfortunately, I think your
motorcycling days are over.

292
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Like hell they are.

293
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,200
It won't be much longer.

294
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,499
Springfield.

295
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,399
Springfield.
Thats where the Indians come from.

296
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,799
- Indians?
- Yeah, the Indians...

297
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,699
from Springfield,
Massachusetts.

298
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,399
The worlïs greatest
motorcycle.

299
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,499
- Is that so?
- Thats right.

300
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,799
- You can come through now.
- Alright, thank you.

301
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,699
Yeah, Springfield.

302
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,199
The plan is for me
to drive up to Timaru and...

303
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,100
then me and my bike...
will catch a boat to the US of A to...

304
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,799
Los Angeles,
and the boat leaves on Saturday.

305
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,499
And I'll buy a car
in Los Angeles...

306
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,299
and drive up to Utah,
to the Bonneville Salt Flats.

307
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,300
- Its really important you do this trip?
- Sure is mate, you know.

308
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,299
Ever since I was a lad I've been
interested in things that go fast...

309
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,599
you know things
that rolls and go and...

310
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,199
at Bonneville things go real fast.
Its...

311
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,699
this giant dried up lake bed...

312
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,399
and it goes for miles
and miles and its dead flat...

313
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,400
and you can drive a vehicle just
as fast as it will go and is.

314
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,699
So is one of the few places
on earth...

315
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,900
where you can find out just what
you're machine is capable of.

316
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,700
In fact here I'm on the, thats me on the
front of the New Zealand Motorcyclist.

317
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,399
Thats the Indian there.

318
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,899
- Very good!
- Yeah, a few years ago.

319
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,499
So I'd best be off soon...

320
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,134
because I don't know how much longer
I've got to live you see.

321
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:20,499
Yes, I don't think
I heard that last statement.

322
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,734
I said I don't know
how much longer I've got to live.

323
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:24,599
I heard you the first time.

324
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,499
So... tell me, Burt.

325
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,499
What are you offering
as collateral for this loan?

326
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,100
Well, my tools, my bits and pieces, my
trophies and a lot of things like this.

327
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:37,234
Well, I don't think they'd be
of much interest to the bank...

328
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:39,434
I think we'd be looking for
something more substantial.

329
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:43,435
Something like the deed
of title to your property.

330
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,400
- Did you get the money?
- Yep, I'm off on Thursday.

331
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,199
Thursday? That soon?
I wish I could come too.

332
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,799
Oh, maybe next time.

333
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,999
Thomas. Its dinner time.
Come home now.

334
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
- Nearly finished, Mrs. Jackson.
- Yeah, Mum, we're almost finished.

335
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,099
See you after dinner, Burt.

336
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,100
Alright, lad.

337
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,399
Hey, not so fast.

338
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,400
I'm the record breaker.

339
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,999
Where are you going?

340
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,199
And thats the...

341
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,200
before I put the...
you know, the streamliner on it.

342
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,399
Whats that one?

343
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,700
Thas a girlfriend of mine
when I first bought the bike.

344
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,800
It was a long time ago that was.

345
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,699
Aren't you scared you'll kill
yourself if you crash?

346
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,899
No...

347
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,799
you...

348
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,599
live more in five minutes
on a bike like this...

349
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,999
going flat out than some people
live in a lifetime.

350
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,699
And...

351
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,900
yeah, more in five minutes.
Thats my Dad there.

352
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,099
And my mum.

353
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,699
They're all gone.

354
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,599
God, its gone by so fast!

355
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,699
You know,
danger is the spice of life...

356
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,099
and you've got to take a risk every now
and again haven't you, son?

357
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,100
You know thats
what makes life worthwhile.

358
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,300
And you know,
having some nice ladies around...

359
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,199
will you pick out my bike?

360
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,200
- You really don't get scared?
- No, no.

361
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,499
You know...

362
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,499
when I was a boy
about your age...

363
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,699
I had a little twin brother
whose name was Ernie...

364
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,100
and one day our Dad was out
the back cutting down a tree...

365
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,699
and...

366
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,600
suddenly it got hung up, the tree
that is, it got stuck on something and...

367
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,399
Ernie went to go and help.
All of a sudden the tree...

368
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,400
slipped and fell on him
and killed him stone dead.

369
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,099
I always remember that.

370
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,000
Anyway, since then I've always tried
never to be scared of anything.

371
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,899
Although I must say before...

372
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,900
a big bike event I do
sometimes get nervous, you know...

373
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,400
if the butterflies
in my stomach were cows...

374
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,700
I'd be able to start
a dairy farm.

375
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,599
Thats funny.

376
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,700
When they took you off in the ambulance
to the hospital. What happened?

377
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,999
I don't know, just a touch
of indigestion I think.

378
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,599
Yeah, thats all it was. There's nothing
wrong with me, don't you worry about me.

379
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,599
And anyway at my age...

380
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,600
any day above ground
and vertical is a good day.

381
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,499
Listen, you take care
of this until I get back alright?

382
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,500
- What happens if you don't come back?
- We'll talk about that then shan't we.

383
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,499
- Hey, Burt?
- Yeah.

384
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,499
Don't forget
to mow your lawns will you?

385
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,799
- What?
- Don't forget to mow your lawns.

386
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,799
My Dad goes on and on about it.

387
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,099
He does, does he?

388
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,100
He says it lowers the property
values of the neighborhood.

389
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Well, oh dear,
we can't have that can we?

390
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,699
What are you doing?

391
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Hello, son.
I'm just getting rid of the grass.

392
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,899
Burt, what the hell
are you doing this time?

393
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,499
Oh, like you said George
I'm getting rid of the grass...

394
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,399
being a good neighbor
before I leave tomorrow.

395
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,599
Tom, Tom!
Get back inside now!

396
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,299
Now!

397
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,300
Honestly, Burt!

398
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,800
- What are they doing here?
- It might be the fire, Burt.

399
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,199
Right, the tyre goes in first.

400
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,199
Thats it.

401
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,199
Thats it, Jeff. You've got it.

402
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,499
This goes in here.

403
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,599
Pills...

404
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,999
license, passport.

405
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,399
Right, lets see,
I've got everything?

406
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,999
Spectacles, testicles,
watch and wallet.

407
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,799
What are you laughing at?

408
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,199
I'm on my way.

409
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,699
- Dad says to call us collect.
- What?

410
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,699
Dad says to call us collect.

411
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,499
- Thats nice of him.
- Tell us how you get on.

412
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,699
Thank you.

413
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,599
Thats our phone number.

414
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
- Do you think you'll break the record?
- Well, I hope so.

415
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Dad doesn't think
you can do it.

416
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,799
Is that what he said?

417
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,299
He said everyone thinks that.

418
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,899
Well...

419
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,900
Except me.

420
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,400
You're a good boy, Tom.

421
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,199
I'll tell you something, son.

422
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
If you don't follow through on your
dreams, you might as well be a vegetable.

423
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,999
What type of vegetable?

424
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,999
I don't know...

425
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,999
a cabbage.

426
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,399
Yeah...

427
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,599
a cabbage.

428
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,684
There you are.
Don't lose it, will you?

429
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:55,685
- I promise I'll look after it.
- Right.

430
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,399
So keep an eye on the place
for me won't you, Tom.

431
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,999
And...

432
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,999
don't forget
to feed the fowls.

433
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,699
- Thats my job.
- Yeah.

434
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,699
And...

435
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,199
you can give
the eggs to Mum and...

436
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,499
what else is there?

437
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,099
Oh, yes...

438
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,400
you can pee on my lemon tree
for me if you like, while I'm away.

439
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:21,399
And there's nothing wrong
with peeing on your lemon tree...

440
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,400
as Confucius used to say, its the best
natural fertilizer in the world.

441
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,599
- Who's Confucius?
- He's some bloke who lives up in Dunedin.

442
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,299
Thanks for you help, chaps.

443
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,999
- Good luck, Burt.
- Thanks, Jeff.

444
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,799
- You show them over there in the States.
- I will.

445
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,899
Take it easy, Burt.

446
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,599
Thats not one of the things
I'm planning on doing, George.

447
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,884
Cheerio, love.

448
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:41,199
Good luck.

449
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,899
Cheerio, my friend.

450
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,699
If you don't go when you wanna go
when you do go, you'll find you're gone.

451
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,699
- I'll see ya.
- See ya, Burt.

452
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,399
Bye, Burt.

453
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,499
- Good luck.
- Cheerio.

454
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,500
See ya, Burt.

455
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,900
Look at that!

456
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,100
Well, Fran,
I'm finally on my way.

457
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,599
I thought some more
of the blokes from the club...

458
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,499
would have dropped
by to see me off.

459
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,199
Well, they probably had
to work today.

460
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,799
Yeah. Yeah, thats right.

461
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,399
Yeah, young Tom tells me...

462
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,699
that no one thinks
I can do it.

463
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,399
- Do you think I can do it, Fran?
- I don't know, Burt.

464
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,400
I don't think it really matters
one way or the other.

465
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,499
You know, I read something once,
years ago.

466
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,699
I learnt it off by heart.

467
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,700
It was Theodore Roosevelt
said it...

468
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,965
its not
the critic that counts...

469
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,200
not the man who points out
how the strong man stumbles...

470
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,200
or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better.

471
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,600
The credit belongs to the man
who is actually in the arena.

472
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,099
Wind your window down!
Down.

473
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,899
What?

474
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,399
Some beer money.

475
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,499
- What?
- Some beer money.

476
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,899
I don't drink.

477
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,699
Good luck.

478
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,199
- You go well.
- Thanks, mate.

479
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,799
Show them Kiwi's can fly.

480
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,499
Yeah, I'll bring you back
the Statue of Liberty.

481
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Good on you mate,
thanks a lot.

482
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Hey, not so fast!

483
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,299
Crikey!

484
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,265
Take it easy, mate!

485
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,300
I thought it was a goner.

486
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,434
Better get going.

487
00:34:34,435 --> 00:34:36,299
Yeah, alright...

488
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,300
take care of the old jalopy,
won't you?

489
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,499
- You look after yourself.
- I will.

490
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,234
You've got your pills
and everything, right?

491
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:48,235
Yeah, yeah, right as rain.

492
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
- You come back in one piece.
- I will, cheerio.

493
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,599
Where's the Captain?

494
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,099
Down below.

495
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,099
- Down the gangway there.
- Thanks.

496
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,799
There we are.

497
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,199
I'm looking for the Captain.

498
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,599
Thats me.

499
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,600
My name's Burt Munro.

500
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,400
I'm supposed to do a job to work
my passage to Los Angeles.

501
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:29,400
- Yeah, well, I hope you can cook.
- Cook?

502
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
- I'll give it a go.
- There's the galley.

503
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,899
Crikey!

504
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,999
Who does the dishes, mate?

505
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You.

506
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,299
Smells good.

507
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,199
What do you have
for us today, Burt?

508
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Its good Kiwi tucker.

509
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,499
Don't let Burt see you
doing that.

510
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,699
Here, don't spoil it
with all that sauce.

511
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,700
- Sorry, Burt.
- Stone the crows!

512
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,199
Are you going to watch
the movie, Burt?

513
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,999
- Whats that?
- Are you going to watch the movie?

514
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,899
- Whats it called?
- Broken Barrier.

515
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,599
- Its supposed to be good.
- Is Jane Russell in it?

516
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,600
There's a spare seat
over here, Burt.

517
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,599
Smoke?

518
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,034
- No. Not for me, mate.
- You don't smoke Burt?

519
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:37,699
No, I don't
and thats why people say to me...

520
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,584
how do you keep going
at your age, Burt...

521
00:36:39,585 --> 00:36:41,399
and I say,
well because I don't smoke...

522
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,799
so I'm telling you young monkeys,
don't smoke.

523
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,799
You can laugh,
but my Dad said...

524
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,199
why contaminate your lungs
with tobacco smoke?

525
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,334
The only thing you accomplish with
smoking is destroying your lungs...

526
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:57,335
- and shortening your life.
- Kill the lights.

527
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,099
Is Jane Russell in this?

528
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,799
Go well, Burt.

529
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,800
- Thanks, mate.
- Not for this.

530
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,399
- Good luck to you, Burt.
- Thanks.

531
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,999
Remember what I said.
Don't smoke.

532
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,299
I'm trying.

533
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,299
Cheerio, mates. See ya.

534
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,699
Welcome to the United States.
Customs to the left.

535
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,799
Thank you, good to be here.

536
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,800
G'day.

537
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,599
G'day.

538
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,199
Please, stand behind the yellow line
until you are called, sir.

539
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,299
Whats that?

540
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,300
- Behind the yellow line.
- Yellow line?

541
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,099
G'day.

542
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,899
Passport and customs declaration,
please sir.

543
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,900
There you are.

544
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,999
How long do you intend
to stay in the United States?

545
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,200
However long it takes me to get
to Bonneville and back.

546
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,399
And the purpose of your visit?

547
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,400
To set a land speed record
on my Indian.

548
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,299
Indian?

549
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,599
Mr. Munro...

550
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,899
- So this is your first time to America?
- Yes, sir.

551
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,899
You gave some rather odd answers
to the Officer...

552
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,799
so we just have a few further
questions we'd like to ask you.

553
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,800
- Well, fire away.
- Well, lets go over again what you said.

554
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,899
Now what exactly do you intend to do
here in the United States?

555
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,799
Well, set a land speed record.

556
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,199
- And how do you intend to do that, sir?
- On my motorcycle.

557
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,699
Its in the hold of the ship
at the moment and...

558
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,400
they're going to unload it tomorrow.
Its an Indian, a 1920 Indian Scout...

559
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,799
modified somewhat.

560
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,299
You know what?

561
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,799
- I think I've read about your bike.
- Yeah?

562
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,099
Yeah, it was in Popular Mechanics,
a couple of years ago.

563
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,899
Thats right, thats me.

564
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,299
A Leslie Hobbs from Christchurch
sent that story.

565
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,299
What was it?
Fastest motorcycle in Australia?

566
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,300
Yeah, and in New Zealand.

567
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,899
Well, I guess you're legitimate,
Mr. Munro.

568
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,799
It sounds like we should be very
honored to have you here in America.

569
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,499
- Well, thank you.
- We're going to give you six months...

570
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,500
that should be time enough
to get the job done.

571
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,199
- Welcome to the USA.
- Thank you very much.

572
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,200
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.

573
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,899
- Gears in the trunk.
- What?

574
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,799
Bags in the back.

575
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,299
Bag, back!

576
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,799
Don't worry about me,
I'll do it myself.

577
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Strewth!

578
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,699
Sit in the back, in the back!

579
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,299
- What?
- You, in the back!

580
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,300
Tell you something, mate,
you don't want to get old around here.

581
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,899
Ta ra.

582
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,799
- Where to?
- What?

583
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,199
- Where to?
- Hollywood.

584
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,999
Yeah, I want to go to Hollywood,
I want to see the film stars.

585
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,599
Okay, we go to Hollywood.

586
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,899
Where in Hollywood?

587
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,900
A motel on Sunset Boulevard...

588
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,099
I hear thats a pretty great street.

589
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,399
I don't know who you talking to lately.
Which motel?

590
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,799
I don't know...

591
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,199
a recommended one.

592
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,899
Come on man, what do you think
I am, an encyclopedia?

593
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Drop me somewhere
and I'll sort it out myself.

594
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Must have a bit
electricity bill here.

595
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,599
Firestone...

596
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,599
Shell.

597
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Its all about cars, isn't it?
I've never seen so many cars.

598
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,699
- You say something, man?
- I said I've never seen so many cars.

599
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Got to get around somehow.

600
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Look, there's a bowling alley.
Do you bowl?

601
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Whats he honking his horn about?

602
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,999
Jesus!
Crikey, did you see that?

603
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,899
That blokes backing into that
geaser's car.

604
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,299
He's crazy, he's nuts.

605
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,199
He did it again.

606
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,899
Don't stare, there's a lot of
crazy people in this town.

607
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,900
I've never seen anything
like that before.

608
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,599
- This should do...
- Whats the damage?

609
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,399
US$28, plus bag...

610
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,699
- US$29.
- What?

611
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,599
Did you just say
what I thought you said?

612
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,899
- Are you deaf?
- What?

613
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,399
- Are you deaf?
- Yeah, I am a bit deaf, but I'm not stupid.

614
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,499
- How much did you say it was?
- US$29.

615
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,900
No, I don't want to buy the cab, mate.
I just want to pay the fare, thas all.

616
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:29,799
- Where you from?
- What?

617
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,099
- You a British?
- No, you must be joking...

618
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,599
I'm no Pommie,
I'm from New Zealand.

619
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,899
Well, this is America.

620
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,199
And the fare, right there on the meter,
US$29.

621
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,999
Open your wallet
and let the moths out.

622
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,999
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

623
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,799
There you go, US$29.

624
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,899
- No, don't forget the tip.
- What?

625
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,499
Yes, we tip in America.

626
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,399
Ten percent.

627
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,099
- How much?
- Ten percent.

628
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Oh yeah, there you go, ten cents.

629
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,999
Excuse me, sir.

630
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,299
- You look like a generous man, sir.
- What?

631
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,299
- You look like a generous man.
- Oh do I?

632
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,899
Yes you do. Would you like to buy
a flower to give to someone special?

633
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,199
Well,
sorry I don't have any cash.

634
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,599
Don't worry,
the money goes to a good cause.

635
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,499
Its for an organization
that helps needy people.

636
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,699
Oh alright, well, how much is it?

637
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,700
- Just give what you can afford.
- Alright, well.

638
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,999
They all look the same to me.
They're all green.

639
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,999
- Yes, thats why we call them green backs.
- That looks like a one.

640
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,499
- Look there's one.
- No, thats a ten.

641
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,499
- Thanks, you have a good day.
- No, thats a ten.

642
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,799
Hey come on miss, thats a ten.

643
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,299
I didn't want to pay that much.

644
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,300
Hey, come back.

645
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,299
- Hey baby.
- What do you want?

646
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,799
- You wanna go?
- Go where?

647
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,999
- Go inside.
- I'm going inside.

648
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,099
I'll take you around the world.

649
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,999
I've just come from halfway
around the world.

650
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,734
15 bucks, baby.

651
00:44:03,735 --> 00:44:05,199
15 bucks.

652
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,200
No, sorry, go away.

653
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Hello.

654
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,534
- I need a room.
- A room will cost you five bucks an hour.

655
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,699
I'm planning on staying
a wee bit longer than that.

656
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,499
- How long?
- I don't know, a couple of days I guess.

657
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,899
- Double occupancy?
- What?

658
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,499
Double occupancy?

659
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,699
No, just me, myself and I.

660
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,700
Will it cost a lot because
I can't afford a lot.

661
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,499
- You a member of Triple A?
- What?

662
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,199
- Are you a Triple A member?
- Never heard of them.

663
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,599
Never heard of Triple A?

664
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,600
No Miss Brittle Britches,
I have not heard of Triple A.

665
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,434
Okay, lets just say
you are a member doll.

666
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:56,699
- Alright.
- Thatll save you ten percent.

667
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,099
How does 22 bucks a night sound?

668
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,299
That much? Is that cheap?

669
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,300
Honey, thats cheaper than cheap.

670
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,099
- Whats your name?
- Tina Washington.

671
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,399
Well, Tina Washington,

672
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,299
I want you to have this,
it might cheer you up a bit.

673
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,899
Get some of that muck
off your pluck.

674
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,799
Well, thank you.

675
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,134
Thats the first nice thing
thats happened round here all week.

676
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,799
You're welcome.

677
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,899
My name's Burt Munro.
From New Zealand.

678
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,599
I'm from down under.

679
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,999
Well, hello, Burt Munro
from New Zealand down under.

680
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,799
I tell you,
I've had a heck of a night.

681
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,800
Welcome to Hollyweird.

682
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,999
Hello?

683
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,299
Anybody home?

684
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,599
- Hello, Tina.
- Good morning, Burt.

685
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,399
You still here?

686
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,499
Thats why you were
so crabby last night.

687
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,099
Don't you ever get any sleep?

688
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,799
I work a night shift.

689
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,499
I'm out of here as soon as James
turns up and he's late.

690
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,999
Yeah, could you phone
this number for me?

691
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,699
Yeah, its a shipping company
and they've got a big box of mine...

692
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,700
and I want to know how
to arrange to get it.

693
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,499
No, you talk to them,
they'll never get my accent.

694
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,099
Okay, what do you want me
to ask them? One moment please.

695
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,800
Ask them when a Burt Munro's box
containing the motorcycle...

696
00:47:08,835 --> 00:47:10,799
will be ready for pick up.

697
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,399
Hello, I'm calling
for Mr. Burt Munro.

698
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,234
Yes, he'd like to know when the box
containing his motorcycle...

699
00:47:16,235 --> 00:47:18,899
- will be available for pick up.
- What ship?

700
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,499
- What ship?
- Rangatira from New Zealand.

701
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,799
The Rangatira from New Zealand.

702
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,499
- Its arrived.
- So he can claim it?

703
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,199
Tomorrow from the Long Beach
customs holding area.

704
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,399
Okay, thank you, I'll tell him.
Bye-bye.

705
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,299
That was pretty fast.

706
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,999
You're late.

707
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I can't stand another minute in
this place. Let me buy you breakfast.

708
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,499
Well, this is great.

709
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,500
You know, I've never seen
a menu with photographs before.

710
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,299
- Are you ready to order, sir?
- What?

711
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,299
- Are you ready?
- Oh yes...

712
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,300
I think the Double Delight,
thats for me.

713
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,699
- How would you like your eggs?
- What?

714
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,099
How would you like your eggs?

715
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,199
Well, I'd like them cooked.

716
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,499
Sunny side up? Over easy?

717
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,500
- I don't know, whatever you recommend.
- Over easy's best.

718
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,399
Alright, eggs over easy.

719
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,899
Make that two.

720
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,799
Over easy.
I must remember that.

721
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,299
Yeah, I like this American
breakfast thing.

722
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,999
Its good.

723
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,400
So my girl, where's the best place
for me to get a used car?

724
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,399
The Valley.

725
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,499
After breakfast I could
take you there.

726
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,499
Oh Well, thank you.

727
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,299
And I'm not a girl.

728
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,300
I'm a boy.

729
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,834
I thought there was something
a little odd about you.

730
00:48:50,835 --> 00:48:54,835
But hey,
you're still a sweetheart.

731
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,600
Yep.

732
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,199
Thanks a million, Tina.

733
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,999
Hey,
there are stacks of cars here.

734
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,499
- I'll be back in the motel later on.
- Bye.

735
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,500
Bye.

736
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,499
How may I help you, sir?

737
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,434
Yeah, I want to buy a car,
a cheap car, a very cheap car.

738
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:34,999
Well, you've come
to the right place, amigo.

739
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,300
In fact, if you can find cars like this
any cheaper, they're probably stolen.

740
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,199
My name's Burt, Burt Munro
from New Zealand. Nice to meet you.

741
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,799
I'm Fernando from El Salvador,
nice to meet you, Mr. Munro.

742
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,999
- You can call me Burt.
- Alright, Mr. Burt.

743
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,234
So how much were you looking
to spend here Mr. Burt?

744
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:53,799
Not a lot Fernando...

745
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,699
I haven't got much left after
the cab ride I took yesterday.

746
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,499
You want US$399 for this?

747
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,399
It sounds a bit sick.

748
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,399
Well, what would you offer me?

749
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,099
Listen, I'll give you US$200
if you'll do me a favor.

750
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,199
Through in the use
of your workshop...

751
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,399
and some of that junk
I see lying around...

752
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,399
I've got to knock up
a trailer...

753
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,799
to drag my bike over
to Bonneville.

754
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,999
Thats not a favor,
US$325 is a favor.

755
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,199
No, US$225.

756
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,099
You're a tough customer, Mr. Burt,
but I like you...

757
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,499
I'm going to give it to you for US$250
and you can use the workshop...

758
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,934
but only at night
and keep the noise down.

759
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:34,999
What about tonight?

760
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,799
Yeah, yeah, tonights ok.

761
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Stop the car, lets get
this thing running properly.

762
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,499
There that sounds better.

763
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,799
- Let me drive.
- Okay, come on.

764
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,599
She's singing
like a bird now.

765
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,999
Oh, she's a good old girl,
isn't she?

766
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
There we are, alright.

767
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:18,300
- You make a left here, Mr. Burt.
- Alright.

768
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,699
The buggers are in the wrong lane.

769
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,399
Stop the car, stop the car.

770
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,299
Turn, turn, this way.

771
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,199
Stop, stop the car.

772
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,099
Keep your shirt on.

773
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,434
- Scoot over, you stupid old bastard.
- Thought I was back in New Zealand...

774
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:44,299
we drive on the other side
of the road over there.

775
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,199
Yeah? You're going to get
us all killed.

776
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,084
Well, you're not in New Zealand,
you're in America.

777
00:51:51,085 --> 00:51:55,085
- I know it.
- We drive on the right side of the road.

778
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Burt.
Let me give you some advice.

779
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,399
When you're driving,
not only here in America...

780
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,299
but anywhere's around the world...

781
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,999
the driver should always
be in the centre of the road.

782
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,684
In the centre.
If you're not in the centre...

783
00:52:19,685 --> 00:52:23,685
you're on the wrong side of the road.
Okay?

784
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,100
You want this right here?

785
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,799
Thats it.

786
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,399
Yeah, good.

787
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,999
Got it.

788
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,999
Its 3 am in the morning.

789
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,965
Yeah, time flies
when you're having fun, doesn't it?

790
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,034
You know, when I told you that
you could use the workshop at night...

791
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,599
I didn't mean all night.
My wife's gonna kill me.

792
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,334
You take yourself off home
and I'll have a snooze...

793
00:52:56,335 --> 00:52:59,099
in the back of the car
and you know, mate...

794
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,499
I'll lock up the place
before I go to sleep.

795
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Seems to me a whole lot of effort
to sell a lousy US$250 motorcar.

796
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,600
Okay, Mr. Burt, you pull the door down.
Have a good night.

797
00:53:09,635 --> 00:53:14,400
Fernando.
Where do I take a leak around here?

798
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,999
- Leak?
- Yeah, a pee...

799
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,299
trouble with the old prostrate,
you know.

800
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,099
Yeah, go straight through those doors,
there's a door there that says Caballero...

801
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,999
Alright.

802
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,099
Well, I'll see you in the morning,
early okay?

803
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,099
Good night.

804
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,100
Where were we?

805
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,999
Burt?

806
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Good morning, Mr. Burt.

807
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,599
- So did you get it all finished?
- Yeah.

808
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,700
All I need to do is find a couple
of wheels and I'll be ready to roll.

809
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,934
Well, you know, I have some wheels
in the back you can have...

810
00:53:51,935 --> 00:53:55,935
- if you just do me a favor.
- Say the word.

811
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,199
Crank her now, Fernando.

812
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,799
Good.

813
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,299
- Burt?
- Yeah?

814
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,599
You're a god damned genius.

815
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,699
Thank you.

816
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,999
Hey listen, why you gotta go?

817
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,999
Why don't you stick around here a while?
I'll pay you well.

818
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,499
Sorry, mate, I've got to get
to Bonneville by the 23rd...

819
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,500
thats when speed week starts and
you know, gotta hit the road.

820
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,899
- Well, you've always got a job here.
- Thanks mate, I'll see ya.

821
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,799
- Best of luck to you.
- Ta ra.

822
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,800
This guy is really good.

823
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,999
Hello, love.

824
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,099
I was worried about you.

825
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,399
Housekeeping said you didn't
sleep in your bed all night.

826
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,499
Do I get a discount for that?

827
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,499
I doubt it.

828
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,099
I need you to show me on a map
how to get to Long Beach...

829
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,099
- so I can pick up my bike today.
- I'm finished here in 15 minutes.

830
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,100
I'll come with you.

831
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,799
Not a bad set of wheels
for 250 bucks eh?

832
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,599
- You sure i'll make it to Utah?
- Yeah.

833
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,899
This old girl will get you
to New Zealand and back.

834
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,299
Here...

835
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:12,300
- hop in my fair, lady.
- Thank you.

836
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,299
The bloke who sold me this car,
he gave me a good tip...

837
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,799
he said always remember
that the driver, thats me...

838
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,399
should be on the centre
of the road.

839
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,199
- Look out, look out!
- Alright.

840
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,200
In New Zealand we always drive
on the other side of the street.

841
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,799
- You do?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

842
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,999
Do you want me to drive?

843
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
No, its alright,
I have to get used to it, haven't I?

844
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,334
This should be customs
right here.

845
00:55:40,335 --> 00:55:44,335
Right.

846
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,799
- Hello.
- May I help you, sir?

847
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,800
Yeah, my name's Burt Munro and
I've come to pick up my motorcycle...

848
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,699
I came into port two days ago
from New Zealand...

849
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,899
and on a freighter
called Rangatira...

850
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,699
and I was told to come here
to clear it through customs.

851
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,999
- Mr. Munro.
- Yeah, Munro...

852
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
M U N R O.

853
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,300
- Wait here a moment, sir.
- Thank you.

854
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Mr. Munro is here
for that damaged shipment.

855
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,099
- Mr. Moonro.
- Munro.

856
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,634
- Come with me please, to the storage area.
- Is there a problem?

857
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:29,299
Your consignment
has suffered some damage.

858
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,199
Oh, no.

859
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Why the heck did I bother to paint
these arrows on the side of it then?

860
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,934
Thats the way it was
delivered here unfortunately.

861
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:39,499
Well, what happened to it?

862
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,434
My information is that
ten tons of fertilizer...

863
00:56:41,435 --> 00:56:43,399
was inadvertently
loaded on top of your box...

864
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,999
while it was in the hold. If I was
you I'd sue the shipping company.

865
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,434
Sue? I haven't got time to waste
my bloomin' life suing anybody.

866
00:56:49,435 --> 00:56:51,599
Get some of your blokes to pull...

867
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,034
this right side up so
we can get into the motorcycle...

868
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:57,799
and see what damage
has been done.

869
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,800
Alright, fellows,
lets get it unwrapped.

870
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,700
The tail looks alright.

871
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,799
No damage so far.

872
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,699
Oh no damage at all.

873
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,899
Good.

874
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,900
- Lucky it was packed so well.
- Yes, its a blimmin' miracle.

875
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Well, the old Indian lives
to fight another day.

876
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,399
Well, thanks a million, Tina.

877
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,934
I don't know what I would have done
without you today...

878
00:57:36,935 --> 00:57:38,999
you're the real salt of the earth,
you know?

879
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,834
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to come home for dinner tonight?

880
00:57:41,835 --> 00:57:43,599
- I can't, love.
- I could cook you a meal.

881
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,799
I've got to get this show on the road,
get out of Dodge as they say.

882
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,199
Okay, my good friend
from Kiwi land.

883
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,699
- You stay in touch, won't you?
- I will.

884
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,499
Here's my phone number.

885
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,799
- Call me and tell me how you're doing.
- I will. Can I call collect?

886
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,800
You can try.

887
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,599
- Its a good job I think you're a woman.
- I am a woman.

888
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,600
Yeah, right. Ta ra love, see ya.

889
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:41,699
- Morning.
- Morning.

890
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,399
Fill her up, would you please?

891
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,899
Regular or Ethol?

892
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,099
Who's Ethol?

893
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,199
Alright...

894
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,200
I'll take Ethol.

895
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,699
- Hello, young fella.
- Hello.

896
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,399
- Is this a rocket ship?
- What?

897
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,599
Is this a rocket ship?

898
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,600
I hope so.

899
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,400
Oh Gosh.

900
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,300
Whats happened to you?

901
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,900
Oh well.

902
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,600
Lets have a look at ya.

903
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,399
Got ya!

904
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,400
Come on!

905
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,099
I thought we were going
to make it you and me...

906
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:46,100
and now look whats happened.

907
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,999
- Hello, mate.
- Got a problem?

908
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,199
Yeah. Am I glad to see you.

909
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,200
Yeah, I've lost a wheel, help me get
my rig back on the road, will you?

910
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,299
Okay, I'll see.

911
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,499
My name's Burt, Burt Munro.

912
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,799
Jake.

913
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,399
- You Indian?
- Yes.

914
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,599
Well, this here could be
the worlïs fastest Indian.

915
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,499
Well, at least until just now.

916
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,299
She's a bit heavy mind you.

917
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,300
So lets take it easy,
one, two, three.

918
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,600
Right.
You live around here, Jake?

919
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,699
What do you want to ride
that contraption for?

920
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,299
Thats a good question.

921
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,300
Well, I guess the reward
is in the doing of it.

922
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,299
Jake, I'm dying for a pee.
Where do I go?

923
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,299
There's a little building
right there.

924
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,099
I've got a touch of prostrate
trouble now.

925
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,399
I have similar problems.

926
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,399
I thought you blokes would have...

927
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,599
some magic cures
for that sort of thing.

928
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,499
Well, we have.

929
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,999
One old remedy is ground up
dog balls...

930
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
- but I prefer prostrate trouble.
- Yeah, I bet you do, mate.

931
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,899
I got you!

932
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,199
Jake, gotta get going,
gotta hit the road.

933
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,200
- Burt, I have something for you.
- Whats that then?

934
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,199
Whats this?

935
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,499
- For good luck.
- Oh yeah?

936
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:22,199
I've never worn jewellery before.
Thanks, mate.

937
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,200
I've got something for you too,
hang on about.

938
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,899
Right...

939
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,900
lets see.

940
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,399
I've got this, its a spare one,
I made it myself.

941
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,199
- What do I do with this?
- You got a hacksaw?

942
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,734
Just slice the top of it,
through where the gudgeon pin goes...

943
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,199
and i'll make a great ash tray.

944
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,199
Not that I approve of smoking,
mind you.

945
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,199
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks a lot, mate. So long.

946
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,099
- Sorry we couldn't fix your trailer.
- Thats alright, I'll get there somehow.

947
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,499
Burt?

948
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,099
What?

949
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,799
For the prostrate.

950
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,299
Use with water,
plenty of water.

951
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,299
It tastes bad. Really bad.

952
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,299
Dogs balls huh?

953
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,300
Well, thanks a lot mate.
See ya.

954
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:10,300
Hello.

955
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Anyone home?

956
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,699
Hello.

957
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,700
Hello, there.

958
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,800
I've got a spot of bother
with my trailer, lost a wheel.

959
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,699
- You're not from around these parts.
- No, I'm from down there.

960
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,499
- What?
- I'm from down under...

961
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,699
The other side of the world,
New Zealand.

962
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,899
Southern most city
in the British Empire.

963
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,499
Called Invercargill.

964
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,499
One of the most beautiful
cities on Earth.

965
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,199
Name's Burt Munro.

966
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,799
Burt? Ada.

967
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,699
- What?
- Ada.

968
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,700
There she is.

969
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,699
We got some problems here,
yes sirree.

970
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,699
I tell you what you need to do.

971
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:09,499
Cannibalize the stuffed axel
out of that old Ford right there.

972
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,399
Lucky for you
I've got some welding gear.

973
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,400
- We'll get a new wheel on there pronto.
- Good.

974
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,199
Thats got it.

975
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,699
When you are...

976
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,399
finished there...

977
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,199
I've got something that
I want to show you.

978
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,799
Yeah, whats that?

979
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,499
Never you mind.

980
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:42,500
You just get that wheel on
there right.

981
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,299
Why'd you bring me out here?

982
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,499
I want to show you this.

983
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,599
What?

984
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,600
Right here.

985
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:11,600
I laid my old boy to rest
twelve years ago next week.

986
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,599
I sure miss him.

987
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,699
I sure do miss the old boy.

988
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,599
He did his level best.

989
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,299
He did.

990
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,699
I always figured a man's
like a blade of grass...

991
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,499
he grows up in the spring,
strong and healthy and green...

992
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:31,100
and then he reaches middle age
and he ripens as it were and...

993
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,499
in the autumn they,
like a blade of grass...

994
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,399
he finishes just fades away
and he never comes back.

995
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,599
Just like a blade of grass.

996
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,899
I think when you're dead,
you're dead.

997
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,999
I've always thought that,
since I grew up.

998
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,399
Is that your philosophy?

999
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,999
Well, I don't know,
yeah, I suppose it is...

1000
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,800
when you get to my age these
thoughts cross your mind sometimes.

1001
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,299
Jump!

1002
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,399
Sideways, you fool,
sideways!

1003
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,399
My God, man, haven't you ever
seen a snake before?

1004
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,099
No, we don't get snakes
in New Zealand.

1005
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:13,099
Good God,
I ought to move there.

1006
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,399
- Where's he going?
- Damn rattlers!

1007
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,599
- Any more around here? Oh, God.
- Fancy this?

1008
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:23,100
You come all this way
to bite the dust up at Boot Hill?

1009
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,599
That would be a laugh,
wouldn't it?

1010
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,199
Be a laugh.

1011
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,899
There you go, there you go.

1012
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,900
Oh, my God!

1013
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,299
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

1014
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:47,300
I don't know, I've no idea.

1015
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I don't know.

1016
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:13,100
I had a strange dream
last night.

1017
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,599
I dreamt about my late...

1018
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,600
twin brother, Ernie.

1019
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I thought he was in the room here
looking down on us.

1020
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,234
I guess its all
that fun and games...

1021
01:09:30,235 --> 01:09:34,235
at the graveyard.

1022
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,799
I suppose.

1023
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,699
Oh, well.

1024
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:42,700
Getting old ain't for the faint
of heart I'll tell you that.

1025
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:46,700
Oh, God. What have you done
to my back, Ada?

1026
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,399
I am getting old.

1027
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,400
Come on old girl, make me a cup of tea,
I've got to hit the road.

1028
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,099
Ada, come on, you haven't died
in our sleep, have you, old girl?

1029
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:03,699
- Make me a cup of tea.
- Come here, lover boy.

1030
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,799
I'll make it myself.

1031
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,800
Thanks.

1032
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,399
Now Burt, you promise me you're going
to pop in on your way back...

1033
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,299
because I can always use
another little cuddle.

1034
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,999
Yeah, thats what I said, Ada,
thats what I intend to do.

1035
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,499
There's many good tune played on
an old Banjo as they say.

1036
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:27,500
- And what we don't use, we lose.
- Well, thats what they say.

1037
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,899
See ya. Ta ra, darling.

1038
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,900
And you have good luck
with your Indian.

1039
01:10:33,935 --> 01:10:37,399
You should say
break a leg.

1040
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,400
See ya.

1041
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,199
Gidday.

1042
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,599
Boy is it hot out there.

1043
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,399
I bet the birds fly backwards
around here...

1044
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,999
to keep the dust out
of their eyes.

1045
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,899
- What can I get you?
- I'd like a cup of tea, please.

1046
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,699
- Cup of tea?
- Yeah, best drink...

1047
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:16,999
for quenching the thirst
when the weather's hot.

1048
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,799
We haven't seen a cup of tea
in here ever.

1049
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,800
We got Coors, we got Schlitz
or Miller or Coke and whiskey.

1050
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,900
Well, I'll have coke then.

1051
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,799
You know smoking's bad for you,
don't you?

1052
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,899
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

1053
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,499
Personally I don't smoke
and I don't drink.

1054
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,899
I had the right education
from my dad on that one.

1055
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,900
He was like King James the first,
great anti-smoking man.

1056
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,399
Sounds like you're on a one
man crusade there grandpa.

1057
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,734
Yeah, well, you're born with one
pair of lungs so why destroy...

1058
01:11:53,735 --> 01:11:56,299
them with that muck?

1059
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,399
Where are you from?
Where's your home town?

1060
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,599
- You English?
- Heavens no...

1061
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,799
I'm no Pommie,
I'm from Invercargill in New Zealand.

1062
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,199
- Where?
- Invercargill.

1063
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:10,099
L- N-V-E-R-C-A-R-G-I-L-L.

1064
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:14,100
I spell it with one L
sometimes to save ink.

1065
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,300
- Got any of those critters over there?
- Oh yes, much bigger though...

1066
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,399
we breed them down there
on big farms...

1067
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,499
and we cut off their antlers and
send them over to Hong Kong and they...

1068
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,500
grind the antlers into dust
and they eat that stuff...

1069
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:35,899
must be some sort of aphrodisiac
or something.

1070
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,399
Puts lead in your pencil.

1071
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,400
You could do with some
of that, Leroy.

1072
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,199
Your girlfriend?

1073
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,899
Wife.

1074
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:52,900
Oh, dear!

1075
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,200
You alright?

1076
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,600
Did you decide to leave Jackie
a tip after all?

1077
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:42,034
Look sir, if you're not feeling well
you should drop in to the hospital...

1078
01:13:42,035 --> 01:13:44,199
in the next town.

1079
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:48,200
Alright.

1080
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,299
Roll down your window.

1081
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,300
What?

1082
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,499
Whats the problem?

1083
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,899
You're parked illegally.

1084
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:38,499
- You're a danger to the passing traffic.
- Am I?

1085
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,500
- Lets see your driver's license.
- Yeah, alright.

1086
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:47,700
Here you are.

1087
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,299
- Where are you from?
- From New Zealand.

1088
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,300
Thats the land of the
long white cloud. Aotearoa.

1089
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,499
Home of the kiwi bird.

1090
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,999
Well, I don't care if you're from Mars,
you cannot stop here.

1091
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,999
Alright.

1092
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,799
You cannot stop on the side of this road,
you're parked illegally.

1093
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,300
Okay, well, sorry, I was having
a bit of a heart attack and...

1094
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,999
well recovering
from one anyway.

1095
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,599
Yeah, well, next time,
how about we stop at a proper rest area.

1096
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,299
Yeah, alright, okay.

1097
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:24,300
Name's Burt Munro.
Sorry about that.

1098
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,499
Oil's OK.

1099
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,599
- Thank you.
- Thats alright, sir.

1100
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,999
Excuse me.

1101
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,399
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

1102
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,999
Listen, I was wondering
if I could catch a ride?

1103
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
My car, she just broke down and I'm
really trying to get to Salt Lake City.

1104
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,299
I'm only going as far as Wendover,
thas where I'm stopping.

1105
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,399
Well, anything would be
better than nothing.

1106
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,400
- Ain't that the truth? Hop in, mate.
- Hey, thank you.

1107
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,199
I'm going to go see
my girlfriend...

1108
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,399
she just moved from LA
to Salt Lake, so.

1109
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,899
I'm home on leave from 'Nam.

1110
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,499
- What?
- Vietnam?

1111
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,199
Oh, yeah.

1112
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,199
Hey, what is that you've
got strapped on back there?

1113
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:14,200
That, young fellow,
is an Indian.

1114
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,199
Motorcycle.

1115
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,099
So what are you doing
in Vietnam?

1116
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,299
I'm involved
in operation ranch hand.

1117
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,199
Oh, whats that?
Farming or something?

1118
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,399
No, not exactly,
we just started this program...

1119
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,299
we are spraying the jungle
from the air with herbicides...

1120
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,899
so the enemy, the Vietcong,
don't have any place to hide.

1121
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:39,100
Agent Orange we call this stuff,
it comes in these big old orange drums.

1122
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:44,099
How is it working out?

1123
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:48,200
Well, I'm home on two months leave
and I've got to get my arse back there.

1124
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,500
We should have this war done in 6 months
or so, thats what they keep telling us.

1125
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,399
Can't wait to get my arse out of there
to tell you the truth.

1126
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,199
Yeah, I remember
the Great War in 1914...

1127
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,500
I was about your age and
thats what they kept telling everyone.

1128
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,599
Soon be over.

1129
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,600
20 million dead and four years later
it was still going on.

1130
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,999
Not as bad
as the big flu epidemic though.

1131
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,899
Killed 21 million, that did.
Maybe more.

1132
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,899
Every day,
when I left to go to work...

1133
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:23,900
my mum would spray some formalin
on my shirt...

1134
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,499
and maybe thats why
I didn't catch it.

1135
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:31,500
Or maybe I was just lucky.
You never know.

1136
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,400
- Knock on wood.
- Yep.

1137
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,299
You know,
life's a funny thing...

1138
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:42,300
you never know
whats around the corner, do you?

1139
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,499
Your shaving brush.

1140
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,099
Has had its day.

1141
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,799
It won't achieve.

1142
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,299
The Modern way.

1143
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,899
Burma Shave.

1144
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:00,499
"She doesn't kiss ya
like she used to?

1145
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,500
Has she seen
some smoother rooster?

1146
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,599
Burma Shave.

1147
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:10,399
These signs we dedicate...

1148
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,799
to men...

1149
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,199
who've had no date of late.

1150
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,299
Burma Shave".

1151
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:21,300
Yeah, thats us.
Well, you anyway.

1152
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,699
Look at that.

1153
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:32,700
Thats a cowboy and a half.

1154
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,599
I was thinking I'd come out
to the Salt with you.

1155
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,634
I'd like to be there
the first time you see it...

1156
01:18:37,635 --> 01:18:39,434
its only a couple of miles
up the road so.

1157
01:18:39,435 --> 01:18:41,599
Yeah, alright then,
that sounds good.

1158
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,399
Looks like there's a lot of people
in town for speed week, huh?

1159
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:48,400
Yeah, looks like it.

1160
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,600
This is it, Burt.
We're gonna take a left right up here.

1161
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,199
Bonneville...

1162
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,999
I mean I can't believe it.

1163
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,699
I mean I'm here, I've made it.

1164
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:15,700
I've made it.

1165
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
You know, all my life
I wanted to do something big.

1166
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:49,000
Something better and bigger
than all the other jokers.

1167
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,099
This is it, Bonneville.

1168
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:56,100
This is the place
where big things happen.

1169
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:03,300
Do you realize, Rusty, the fastest
man has ever gone on land is here?

1170
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:08,300
Right here, where we are now.

1171
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,600
Malcolm Campbell did it here,
with a Bluebird.

1172
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:16,099
First guy to go
over 300 mile an hour...

1173
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:19,199
and then later his son, Donald Campbell
was here with Proteus.

1174
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,200
He crashed at 350 mile an hour
and lived to tell the tale.

1175
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,499
John Cobb was here.

1176
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:31,500
First guy
to go over 400 mile an hour.

1177
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,999
All the great attempts.

1178
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,299
George Easton with Thunderbolt and...

1179
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:41,300
Mickey Thompson
with Challenger.

1180
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,600
I'm telling you, Rusty,
this place is holy ground, mate.

1181
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,399
Holy ground.

1182
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,400
And I made it here.

1183
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,599
Well, Burt.

1184
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,999
Thanks a million.

1185
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,399
I'll be looking for you
in the record books.

1186
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,834
You take care out there in Vietnam,
won't you?

1187
01:21:28,835 --> 01:21:30,299
I'll be trying.

1188
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,899
- Okay, mate.
- Drive safe.

1189
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:35,900
- See ya
- See ya.

1190
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,300
God.

1191
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,500
Jesus.

1192
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:58,700
- Gidday.
- Hey, there.

1193
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,699
- Its going to be a great day.
- Yeah.

1194
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,899
Still... no wind.

1195
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,299
Lovely day for a run.

1196
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,084
Salts in good shape.

1197
01:24:10,085 --> 01:24:12,099
Yeah. Firm and dry.

1198
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,899
Dead flat. No soft patches.

1199
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,699
Not like the beach.

1200
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:20,199
I can do it here.

1201
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,899
Yep.

1202
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:25,900
This week.
Its what we're here for.

1203
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,099
Wow, is that yours?

1204
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,899
Yep.

1205
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,699
Gosh, she's a beauty.

1206
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,599
I bet she goes fast.

1207
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,699
- That yours?
- Yeah, thats an old Indian.

1208
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,699
My name's Munro, Burt Munro.

1209
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,799
- From down under, New Zealand.
- A long way from home.

1210
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,499
Jim Moffatt, San Jose,
California.

1211
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,499
- Nice to meet you, Burt.
- Good to meet you, Jim.

1212
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,599
Lets get to the start line.

1213
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:58,200
The race is about to start
and all the racers are excited.

1214
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,600
This car is driven by Jim Moffatt,
San Jose, California.

1215
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:06,900
The other pilots are...

1216
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,799
- Come on, guys, 15 minutes.
- Come on.

1217
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:23,800
Come on, lets go.

1218
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,299
- Morning.
- Hello, Burt Munro.

1219
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,699
- Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

1220
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:38,099
- Are you checked in?
- No, not yet.

1221
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:42,100
Well, you've got to remove the shell
before we do the tech inspection.

1222
01:25:42,135 --> 01:25:44,599
- Where do I check in?
- Its just over there.

1223
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,600
- Thanks, fellas.
- Okay.

1224
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,399
I gotta see this.

1225
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,299
Hello, I've come to check in.
Munro, Burt Munro.

1226
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,699
Registration number?

1227
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,099
What?

1228
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:01,199
Registration number.
I don't see your number here.

1229
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,299
No, its number 35.

1230
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:08,300
Its on the side of my motorcycle
over there, thats my lucky number.

1231
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,399
Have you registered?

1232
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,899
No, thats what
I've come over for.

1233
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:16,499
These two blokes sent me over here,
Mike and someone else.

1234
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,099
Sir, registration closed
last month.

1235
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:23,100
If you haven't registered,
I'm sorry, you just can't run.

1236
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,499
I can't run?

1237
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,734
Well, how was I supposed to know
I should have pre-registered?

1238
01:26:31,735 --> 01:26:33,951
I've come a heck of a long way
to ride my bike.

1239
01:26:33,952 --> 01:26:36,099
I'm not going anywhere
until I've done just that.

1240
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:39,399
I've come all the way from New Zealand,
you know. Its a long way.

1241
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,299
Look, mister,
we don't make the rules.

1242
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:44,734
An event like this doesn't just happen
in one day, rules are rules.

1243
01:26:44,735 --> 01:26:46,699
Entries closed July 31st.

1244
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:50,700
Well, crikey, I live in Invercargill,
its half way round the bloody earth.

1245
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,734
How was I supposed to know these things?
I didn't know all this stuff.

1246
01:26:53,735 --> 01:26:55,099
Sir, its not our problem.

1247
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,734
I thought I could just turn up here
and have my bike timed.

1248
01:26:57,735 --> 01:27:01,735
- You don't have to call me...
- Well, you thought wrong.

1249
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,599
Jim Moffatt!

1250
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,699
Its Burt, Burt Munro.
Can you come over here, mate?

1251
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,799
I'll be right back.

1252
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,699
I need a bit of help.

1253
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,599
Hey, Burt. Whats up?

1254
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,499
Well, I have these blokes telling
me I can't run my bike...

1255
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,799
because I'm not pre-registered.

1256
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,399
- You didn't register?
- No, I didn't know anything about it.

1257
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,199
You know how it is Jim,
rules are rules.

1258
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:37,200
- You should have registered months ago.
- I didn't know.

1259
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,499
I'll have a talk with these guys later,
see if I can change their minds.

1260
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:44,099
- Your blooïs worth bottling.
- I don't know about that.

1261
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,099
Look,
we can talk about this later.

1262
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,099
Maybe you can let him go
through tech inspection.

1263
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:52,100
Get that out of the way?
Just in case we can let him ride.

1264
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,399
You're asking a lot.

1265
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,400
Alright.

1266
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,299
- Okay.
- Alright.

1267
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:04,699
- Make me proud.
- Thanks a lot.

1268
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:08,700
You give me a bit
of a fright there.

1269
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,699
You know these don't look
like high speed tyres.

1270
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:17,099
Well, they are high speed tyres.

1271
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:20,799
Look at these hairline cracks,
these tyres have got to be 25 years old.

1272
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,699
- What happened to the tread?
- What?

1273
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,799
I said,
what happened to the tread?

1274
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,299
Well, I cut it off,
thats what happened to the tread...

1275
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,699
I cut it off with a carving knife...

1276
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,499
otherwise it wouldn't be
a high speed tyre, would it?

1277
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,899
What are you talking about?

1278
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:35,134
Well, you've got to keep the weight in
otherwise when you get to a high speed...

1279
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:37,799
the centrifugal force will
the tread right off, wouldn't it?

1280
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,800
I run them on 65 pounds of air and
that tyre's safe up to 300 miles an hour.

1281
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,499
I guarantee it. These are high
speed tyres and I made them.

1282
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,699
Well, you're going to have
to replace them.

1283
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,599
The suspension here is
a leaf spring...

1284
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,999
I mean can we pass that?

1285
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,299
Geez, last leaf spring on a motorcycle
must have been in the 1920s.

1286
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,899
Well, it is 42 years old.

1287
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:58,900
- These brakes look completely inadequate.
- Well, I'm planning on going, not stopping.

1288
01:28:58,935 --> 01:29:02,499
Well, the brakes were old
fashioned 40 years ago.

1289
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,499
Is this a hinge of a gate post?

1290
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:08,449
No, thats from an old kitchen door.

1291
01:29:08,484 --> 01:29:12,399
Let me just ask you what is this?

1292
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,599
Its a cork, what does it look like?
Its a cork from a brandy bottle.

1293
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,000
You know, the thing is its all about
weight. The less weight, the faster you go.

1294
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,399
And where's your chute?

1295
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,399
- What?
- Where's your parachute?

1296
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,399
I'm not planning on bailing out.

1297
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,834
No wait,
you've got to have a safety chute.

1298
01:29:27,835 --> 01:29:29,299
Well, I can't afford one.

1299
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,199
These forks, if they give out we've
got ourselves some real problems.

1300
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,199
I think I'd have a bit of
a problem that way, wouldn't I?

1301
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,999
- Where's your fire suit?
- What?

1302
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,399
Where's your fire suit?

1303
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,999
Good heavens, man,
I don't intend to burst into flames.

1304
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,184
Always wear me old suit pants
for good luck.

1305
01:29:43,185 --> 01:29:45,299
If they were good enough
to get married in...

1306
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,899
they're good enough to ride
this old girl in and no...

1307
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:50,199
I tuck the legs of my pants
into my socks like this...

1308
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:53,699
stop them getting caught
in the chain and Bob's your uncle.

1309
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,034
You've got your suit pants,
what are you gonna wear on top?

1310
01:29:56,035 --> 01:29:56,899
What?

1311
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:00,099
You've got your suit pants,
what do you intend to wear on top?

1312
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:04,500
Yes, a black woolen shirt, New Zealand
wool, water resistant, fire resistant...

1313
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,899
and me bash hat.

1314
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,099
Bash hat?

1315
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,099
Yeah, crash helmet.

1316
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,434
You're crazy, you've got to wear
at least a leather jacket on top.

1317
01:30:13,435 --> 01:30:16,734
You put the bike down on the salt,
its like coarse sand paper...

1318
01:30:16,735 --> 01:30:18,134
its going to rub
your head right off.

1319
01:30:18,135 --> 01:30:19,899
I couldn't get into the shell...

1320
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:23,199
with anything bulkier than the shirt on
my back. Its a very tight fit in there.

1321
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,399
Straight out of the ark.

1322
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,599
- What did you say?
- Straight out of the ark.

1323
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,099
Don't be so cheeky.
Whats your name, young man?

1324
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:33,199
McFarlane. Mike McFarlane.

1325
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,499
I knew a McFarlane, he used to sell
milking machines in Timaru.

1326
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:40,099
You must be related to him
because he was a total prick.

1327
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,399
Look here, you don't even have
a fire extinguisher installed.

1328
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:47,000
Mike McFarlane used to give me milking
machine parts to make my sprockets with.

1329
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,199
How old are you?

1330
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,099
I don't know,
he was about 35 when I knew him.

1331
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:51,299
No how old are you?

1332
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,999
His brother owned a general store
down in a place called Bulls...

1333
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,999
- thats a town in New Zealand.
- Sir, your machine is not safe.

1334
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,999
I've been doing this for 43 years
and I'm still here to tell the tale.

1335
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,399
Time's change, we started taking
airplanes instead of riding horseback.

1336
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,334
- Horse power?
- Horse back. Horse back.

1337
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,599
Horse back, yeah.
I got you, yeah.

1338
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,299
You're too old.

1339
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:13,234
Bollocks. I may have this saggy skin
on the outside...

1340
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:14,899
but on the inside
I'm still 18 years old...

1341
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:18,399
and I'll give you a run for your money,
young fella.

1342
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,299
You need some help?

1343
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:22,499
Hello.

1344
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,699
Rollie Free, Marty Dickerson,
we're a couple of bike fans.

1345
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:29,700
- Burt Munro from Kiwi land.
- Pleasure, Burt.

1346
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,999
You got me good there.

1347
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,699
Where are you staying?

1348
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,699
Thats my salubrious
accommodation...

1349
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,199
I usually sleep at night
in the back seat.

1350
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,999
Salubrious you say Munro, huh?

1351
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,999
We've been hearing a lot about you.

1352
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,399
Sounds like you're cutting
your finances mighty fine.

1353
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,099
Yeah, you could say that again.

1354
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,499
We'll we're up at the Western Ridge,
why don't you drop by...

1355
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,599
it looks as though you could
use a good shower...

1356
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,899
and everybody's staying there and
I bet that there's a spare bed there too.

1357
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,499
Thanks a lot, you yanks
are classic you know that?

1358
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:02,500
You don't catch me that easily.

1359
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,999
Hey, Burt.

1360
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,299
Hello.

1361
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,299
The front forks could
go at any time...

1362
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:15,799
the suspension is right out
of the 1920s.

1363
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,199
Got hairline cracks all
over his tyres...

1364
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,299
he's got no fire extinguisher,
no safety chute.

1365
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,899
I told you, if its a time problem, the
old guy's welcome to use some of my time.

1366
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:27,499
Its not a time problem,
its a bike problem.

1367
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,499
Well, I think we ought
to let him run.

1368
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,699
He came all the way from
New Zealand to do this.

1369
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:34,299
Jim, have you had a good look
at his machine?

1370
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,399
All I know is the man's
the genuine article.

1371
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,699
Yeah, but the bike is
the genuine dinosaur.

1372
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,599
Look, we carry the cans
for the decisions around here.

1373
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,634
And if he kills himself and there's
about a 100 to 1 that he will.

1374
01:32:44,635 --> 01:32:47,399
Are gonna have a hell
of a lot of trouble on our hands.

1375
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:52,100
Yeah, sounds like we're a bunch
of chicken shits if you want my opinion.

1376
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:56,200
His bike didn't even come close
to passing tech inspection, Jim.

1377
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,299
Burt.

1378
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,299
Hello, Jim. Come in.

1379
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,199
Rollie Free said
I could find you here.

1380
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,399
Rollie Free, he's the best,
he's a real gentleman.

1381
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:18,400
He set me up in this place
for nothing.

1382
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,899
What are you doing?

1383
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:25,499
Well, the soft shoe polish
fills in the cracks makes the tyres...

1384
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,899
look spick and span,
good as new.

1385
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,699
Cheaper than new ones anyway.

1386
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:33,599
I didn't see that.

1387
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,600
Well? Can I run?

1388
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:42,400
I'm sorry, Burt.

1389
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:49,799
Who the heck
do they think they are?

1390
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,399
Crikey Jim, you know, I'm not trying
to run a mile in four minutes...

1391
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:56,299
all I've got to do is sit there
and open up the throttle...

1392
01:33:56,300 --> 01:34:00,300
I mean, after all
its my ruddy life, isn't it?

1393
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,299
Can't you do anything?

1394
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:06,900
I mean, I just want to try and get her
to go over 200 just once thas all...

1395
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,899
once I've cracked 200
I'll be quite happy...

1396
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:12,099
to piss off back home to New Zealand
and Bob's your uncle.

1397
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:16,100
You're a well respected man around here,
can you talk to them?

1398
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,399
I tried.

1399
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,434
You've got as much chance
of writing yourself off as I have...

1400
01:34:21,435 --> 01:34:25,435
you know that.
Just talk to them again.

1401
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:29,500
I know they'll listen to you, mate.

1402
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:33,199
Okay Burt, I'll try.
See you tomorrow.

1403
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,200
Okay.

1404
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:41,400
I mean I'm half the age of some
of those characters out there.

1405
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,699
Whats that?

1406
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:52,700
Thats just indigestion.

1407
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:01,000
Everyone wants us old buggers
to curl up in some quiet corner and die.

1408
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:05,900
Well, Burt Munro's not ready to finish
yet, I'll tell you that, mate.

1409
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,499
I'll give it a shot
but I'm not promising anything.

1410
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:15,500
Thanks, mate.
Thanks a lot.

1411
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,800
The famous Challenger One...

1412
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:33,699
What is he doing?

1413
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:36,599
- Didn't Jim tell him?
- He says he did.

1414
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,434
- Well, then whats he doing here?
- Why won't you let him run?

1415
01:35:39,435 --> 01:35:42,199
Hey, he's too old
and his bike's too old.

1416
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,699
He's come half way round the world
to ride that cycle.

1417
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,199
Yeah, come on.

1418
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:50,200
- Wendy, if he was to kill himself.
- So? Its his life.

1419
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:52,899
Keep an eye out
for those officials.

1420
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:55,584
You sure you want to do this?
I'm not sure its a good idea.

1421
01:35:55,585 --> 01:35:58,299
Hurry up. If we're going to do
this thing you've got to hurry.

1422
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:02,300
Alright, lets go,
here's your helmet.

1423
01:36:02,335 --> 01:36:03,899
Here's your goggles.

1424
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,899
- Come on, Burt. We've got to go.
- Yeah, right.

1425
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:09,900
Come on, put them on.

1426
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:16,300
Go, go, come on.

1427
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,699
Okay, lets go, push.

1428
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:21,399
Push, go fast.

1429
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,199
Hey, you can't. Hey...

1430
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:26,899
- you can't do that.
- Come on, come on!

1431
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,900
Hang on!

1432
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:36,900
Hey, where are you going with that?

1433
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,699
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1434
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:46,199
What the hell are you doing, Burt?
What the hell are you doing?

1435
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,099
Just getting her warmed up, Bob.

1436
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,799
Didn't look like you were
getting her warmed up.

1437
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,134
Jesus, he was going to take
the thing for a freakin' run.

1438
01:36:52,135 --> 01:36:53,251
Bob.

1439
01:36:53,252 --> 01:36:56,399
Oh, boy.

1440
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,400
That is the most determined man
I have ever seen in my entire life.

1441
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:04,199
I kind of feel sorry
for the old cooty.

1442
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,199
Coming all this way.

1443
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,384
Isn't there some way
we can accommodate him?

1444
01:37:08,385 --> 01:37:10,599
I mean there can't be
much risk there...

1445
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,699
his bike will be
lucky if it does 70.

1446
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:17,700
What do you say? What if we bend
the rules this once, huh?

1447
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:23,500
Jesus!

1448
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,499
Bob and I had a little chat...

1449
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:29,500
and we're thinking we're gonna
organize a handling run for you.

1450
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:32,899
- You are? What?
- A handling run.

1451
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:35,234
All the officials,
we're gonna get into our vehicles and...

1452
01:37:35,235 --> 01:37:36,399
- You're joking, huh?
- No, I'm not.

1453
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,499
We're going to follow
along behind you...

1454
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,534
and we're going to see
if you're okay to ride this beast.

1455
01:37:40,535 --> 01:37:41,599
Of course I'm okay to ride it.

1456
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,600
First thing tomorrow morning, alright?
Bright and early.

1457
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,099
Well, thanks fellas.

1458
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:53,100
Hey. My luck's in then.

1459
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,899
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1460
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:59,900
Don't hurt yourself.

1461
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:12,599
Okay, everyone listen up.
This is what we're gonna do.

1462
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:15,099
Burt, you're gonna get rolling...

1463
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:18,934
ride slowly along. We'll all jump in
our vehicles, follow you down the track.

1464
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:21,599
- See if you can handle this thing.
- I'll handle her alright.

1465
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,499
Alright. Everybody got that?

1466
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:27,500
Okay, everybody,
lets get in the cars.

1467
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:53,800
Hope that old man doesn't make
a fool of himself.

1468
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,299
Here we go.

1469
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,499
I'm ready, lets go.

1470
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,899
Push it!

1471
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:06,499
Faster, boys.

1472
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,500
Go, Burt!

1473
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,899
Sixty.

1474
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:37,099
Sixty-five, seventy.

1475
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,499
That a boy, Burt.

1476
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,199
Seventy-five.

1477
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:44,200
There he goes up to eighty,
eighty, eighty five.

1478
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,600
Ninety.

1479
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:59,900
Ninety-five,
look at that thing go.

1480
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:12,299
- Holy smoke.
- He's leaving them behind!

1481
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,099
What the hell is
that old guy up to?

1482
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,099
Nobody told him
he could give it everything.

1483
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:18,699
I guess that solves the question
of whether or not he can handle it.

1484
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:21,099
We were doing ninety-five
and he left us in the dust.

1485
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:22,699
Look at him go!

1486
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:26,700
That a boy, go, Burt.

1487
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:06,799
Hold her firm.

1488
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,199
Got it? Don't let it go.

1489
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,699
That was a disaster!

1490
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:16,700
- Hey, Burt. How'd it go.
- Not good.

1491
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,999
So, whats the verdict?

1492
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,999
When you opened up there in top
gear you sure left us in the dust.

1493
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,899
I couldn't even get her out
of second gear, Earl.

1494
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:31,900
The plugs were oiling up, I had to feed
her more juice up the revs a little.

1495
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Well, I guess we'll see if you're
telling us the truth, Munro.

1496
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:40,199
Are you telling me I can officially run
on the track and have it timed?

1497
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:44,200
Thats what I'm saying, Burt.

1498
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,899
You'll never know what
this means to me, Otto.

1499
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:50,199
25 years I've lived for this day,
25 years.

1500
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:54,200
Sometimes you've got to bend the rules
a little, today's one of those days.

1501
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:58,400
- Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you.

1502
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,400
- What did they say?
- What happened?

1503
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,399
They said I could run.

1504
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,199
Thats great!

1505
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,699
- So why the long face then?
- Well, I don't know...

1506
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:18,299
its just starting to sink in
and I've got a problem a big problem.

1507
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:21,799
As soon as I go over a hundred and
ten it starts to wobble like heck...

1508
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,299
a bad speed wobble.

1509
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:27,300
Well, it did look like you were
about as stable as my last wife.

1510
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:31,199
I've got a theory
and I think I'm right.

1511
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:34,099
I need about twenty car batteries.

1512
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:35,899
Twenty?

1513
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,299
Is it ok to steel
these batteries, Burt?

1514
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,199
We're not steeling them Marty,
we're souveniring them.

1515
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,399
Careful of that acid there.

1516
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,199
What do we do
with them now?

1517
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:47,199
Well, we're going to talk someone
into lending us a painter's blow torch.

1518
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,999
A painter's blow torch?

1519
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,999
What are we going to do
with all this metal, Burt?

1520
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Well, when this cools down,
we'll have ourselves a lead brick.

1521
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:03,300
- What do you do with a lead brick?
- Place it in the front of the motorcycle.

1522
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:06,999
- And thats your plan?
- Yeah.

1523
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,500
Well, you must get the center
of pressure behind the center of gravity...

1524
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,634
and if you don't get it right
then she'll start to fish tail...

1525
01:43:14,635 --> 01:43:17,799
- when you get her wound up.
- What do you mean by fish tail?

1526
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,784
Well, like a fish's behind you know.
I'll start doing that.

1527
01:43:20,785 --> 01:43:23,899
And thats what happened today
when I had the handling run.

1528
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:27,900
And so in a panic I lifted my head up
from behind the screen...

1529
01:43:27,935 --> 01:43:31,865
and suddenly the bike started
to go straight and...

1530
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:36,200
I knew I'd solved the problem somehow
by sticking my head up into the wind.

1531
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,099
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

1532
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:42,399
Well, I'll show you.
Let me have that.

1533
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,299
What are you doing?

1534
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:47,999
Lmagine the cigar
is my streamliner.

1535
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,899
Don't poke holes in the cigar.

1536
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:53,900
Now if I hold it in the middle
and blow on it. Like so.

1537
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,799
See how unstable it is?

1538
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,399
Now if I...

1539
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,399
- shift the...
- Not again!

1540
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:05,400
Center of pressure here.
And blow on it.

1541
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,499
See its much more stable.

1542
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:14,700
Just the center of pressure
is behind the center of gravity...

1543
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,999
and thats what I'm trying to fix
with the lead brick you see.

1544
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,899
You're quite clever,
did you know that, Burt?

1545
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:23,599
Now all I need to do is to test
my theory before I run on the salt...

1546
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,499
and I was thinking of,
you know...

1547
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:28,299
crossing over the state line
from here in Utah to Nevada...

1548
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:32,400
where there's no speed limit and running
with a lead brick in the front of it.

1549
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:24,599
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1550
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,699
Do you know how fast you were
going back there?

1551
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:28,499
Yeah, about...

1552
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:32,500
150, 160 miles an hour.

1553
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:36,899
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1554
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:39,499
How's he going to talk
his way out of this one?

1555
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,899
He sure got his arse
in a sling this time, don't he?

1556
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:46,799
So whats the situation with this thing?
You don't have any license plates on it.

1557
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,199
- Its registered in New Zealand.
- New Zealand?

1558
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:54,200
Yeah, thats where I come from.

1559
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,499
Alright, you mean to tell me...

1560
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:01,299
that this contraption of yours
is registered for the road?

1561
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:04,999
- Yeah, in New Zealand.
- New Zealand, right.

1562
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,599
Well, how about taking it easy
here in Nevada?

1563
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,599
Just because we don't have
a speed limit don't mean...

1564
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:14,600
- we want people killing themselves.
- No, sounds fair enough to me.

1565
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,034
- Right, you have a good day then.
- I will, thank you.

1566
01:46:18,035 --> 01:46:20,999
Burt, everything OK?

1567
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,899
Well, fellows, we're going to have
to give the lead brick...

1568
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:27,199
the old Spanish archer.

1569
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:31,099
- Spanish archer?
- Yeah, the big elbow, you know.

1570
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:33,299
The lead brick has got to go.

1571
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,799
Who's stupid idea was that anyway?

1572
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:36,699
It was yours.

1573
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:41,500
Yeah. Well, I'm just going to have
to ride her, the way she is.

1574
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,499
What about that speed wobble?

1575
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:47,199
Well, I'll cross that bridge
when I get there.

1576
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:49,999
- I've got another problem too.
- Yeah, what now?

1577
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,699
Well, when I get her going...

1578
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:56,700
there's an enormous amount of heat
comes off the exhaust pipe...

1579
01:46:56,735 --> 01:47:00,700
and I hope
it doesn't cook my leg.

1580
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,000
Maybe you can wrap some asbestos cloth
around it, that should fix it right.

1581
01:47:05,035 --> 01:47:06,899
Thats a good idea.

1582
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,434
So you got any more problems
you want to tell us about?

1583
01:47:09,435 --> 01:47:12,299
Yes, yes, my old ticker.

1584
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:16,300
- You've got a bad heart?
- Yes, I have.

1585
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,299
I've got a little surprise
for you.

1586
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,299
- What?
- Close your eyes and give me your hand.

1587
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:27,099
- What?
- Just close your eyes. Come on.

1588
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:31,100
- What for?
- Because I said so, mister, come on.

1589
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,899
Keep walking.

1590
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:37,599
Wendy, you're not going to make
a fool of an old man I hope.

1591
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,399
I'd never do that, Burt.

1592
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:40,799
Never.

1593
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,499
Never. Okay. Okay.

1594
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:44,599
Now turn around.

1595
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:45,899
Alright.

1596
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,399
Now, hold your hands out.

1597
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,099
Put that in your pocket.

1598
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,399
Alright.

1599
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,799
There we go good.

1600
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,800
You can open them.

1601
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:13,999
What are you all staring at?

1602
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,199
- What is this?
- Burt...

1603
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:20,200
we've unanimously voted you here on
the Salt planes, sportsman of the year...

1604
01:48:20,235 --> 01:48:23,634
because we figured nobody has
ever traveled as far as you have...

1605
01:48:23,635 --> 01:48:24,999
to be here for speed week...

1606
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,467
so normally we would present
a trophy or something like that...

1607
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:31,934
but considering your case
we thought a few extra dollars...

1608
01:48:31,935 --> 01:48:35,935
would be more appreciated
so we past the hat around.

1609
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,600
My goodness!

1610
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:46,900
There are no words.

1611
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:00,699
Well, thank you all.

1612
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:04,499
Thank you all very much.

1613
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,465
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

1614
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:11,699
Oh dear, its quite
overwhelming you know...

1615
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:15,700
its 25 years dream
to come here.

1616
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:22,100
I should try
to justify you, your respect and...

1617
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:28,100
you know the original speed
of my old bike was 54 miles an hour.

1618
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:35,400
And today I'm hoping to,
you know, improve it a little.

1619
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,199
The cars are at the start line now.
The next one is the 86...

1620
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:53,200
On the bucket seat
the pilot is ready to be pushed out.

1621
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:04,799
Next competitor is Burt Munro.

1622
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,800
All the way from Invercargill,
New Zealand.

1623
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Burt Munro's entry
was approved just yesterday.

1624
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:22,399
Burt, where'd you get this stuff?

1625
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,799
- What?
- I say, where'd you get this stuff?

1626
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:28,800
I tore an old electric blanket apart
and got the asbestos cloth out of it.

1627
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,199
You got those heart pills?

1628
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:33,799
- Are you okay?
- Better take one, yeah.

1629
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,384
They're almost ready.

1630
01:50:35,385 --> 01:50:37,999
Guys, come on, lets go.

1631
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,434
You know the bottle says
that they may cause drowsiness...

1632
01:50:40,435 --> 01:50:43,399
- do not operate machinery.
- I know that.

1633
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,499
Well, you're not supposed
to take two of them anyway.

1634
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,899
One for me
and one for the old girl.

1635
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:49,599
Nitroglycerine.

1636
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,699
Should make it go faster.

1637
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:55,700
Have some of this, love.

1638
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:01,200
There you go.

1639
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:08,199
- Yeah, we're almost there.
- Alright, here we go.

1640
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,699
- Hold her still.
- Your goggles.

1641
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:10,699
- What?
- Goggles.

1642
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:14,700
- Put your goggles on.
- I know, calm down.

1643
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:21,500
I can't get my leg in because
of the asbestos cloth on it.

1644
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,199
Let me take it off.

1645
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:35,200
- What about your leg in that heat?
- Screw it, I've got a spare one.

1646
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:38,699
Right, Burt.

1647
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:41,199
Get those goggles.

1648
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,899
- Ready?
- Alright, you know the way.

1649
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:44,999
Make sure you come back.

1650
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,499
Come on, lets go!

1651
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,699
Right, push!

1652
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:52,599
Come on, fellas. Push faster!

1653
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:56,600
Keep running.

1654
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,799
Keep it straight, buddy.

1655
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,399
Bring it in, Burt. Come on.
Go, go, go...

1656
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:07,400
Lets go, Burt!

1657
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,999
Come on, Burt!

1658
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,899
You can do it, Burt.

1659
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:17,900
He's got no parachute,
he's got no brakes.

1660
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,999
158.647.

1661
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,599
Mile one,
158.647 miles per hour.

1662
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,199
Go, Burt!

1663
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,499
- Go on!
- Go, Burt!

1664
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:49,500
- Make us proud, honey!
- Burt!

1665
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,799
167.921.

1666
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:08,599
Mile two,
167.921 miles per hour.

1667
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:11,299
Break it, Burt.
Come on! Go, go, go!

1668
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:15,300
Come on, Burt.

1669
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,400
Mile three,
171.371 miles per hour.

1670
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:30,500
Come on, come on, come on!

1671
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:43,600
Mile four,
172.485 miles per hour.

1672
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:44,899
Yeah!

1673
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:47,399
Come on!

1674
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:51,400
Mile five,
183.694 miles per hour.

1675
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,499
193.728.

1676
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:16,399
Mile six,
193.728 miles per hour.

1677
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:20,400
Come on, come on!

1678
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:25,899
Come on, Burt.
You can do it!

1679
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:27,499
Come on, Burt!

1680
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:31,500
Mile seven,
194.211 miles per hour.

1681
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:35,600
- Go, Burt!
- Burt, go!

1682
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:20,699
What is it?

1683
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:23,099
201.851.

1684
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:27,700
Mile eight,
201.851 miles per hour.

1685
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:38,199
Ladies and gentlemen,
thats a new record...

1686
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:42,300
201.851 miles per hour.

1687
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,299
Burt, I hope you're going
to stop soon.

1688
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:50,399
- He's gone back!
- Back where?

1689
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,400
Back to whatever planet he came from
because he sure ain't from this one.

1690
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:52,500
I really did toast my leg.

1691
01:56:56,100 --> 01:57:02,100
I did it.

1692
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:33,300
Tom, can you get that,
my hands are wet.

1693
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:38,599
Hello?

1694
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:42,499
This is the United States calling I have
a collect call from Mr. Burt Munro...

1695
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:43,899
will you accept the charge?

1696
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:48,200
- Mum, its Burt calling collect.
- It is? Accept the call, accept the call!

1697
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:49,899
My mum said we can accept the call.

1698
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:52,899
- Go ahead, sir.
- Hello Tom, is that you?

1699
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:55,199
- Yes.

He set a new record.

1705
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:26,199
How is it going?

1706
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:27,699
Hello, mate!

01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,134

1708
01:58:29,135 --> 01:58:30,699
Hello, Frank.

1709
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:32,799

1710
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:36,399
My goodness, you've made
this place look spiffing, mate.

1711
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:37,599
You did us proud.

1712
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:41,199
- You put Invercargill on the map.

1714
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,899
if I'm to get back to Bonneville
next year, you know.

1715
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:49,199
So, more early mornings then?

1716
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:51,299
Yeah, more early mornings.

1717
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:52,499
Hello, love.

1718
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:55,999

1719
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,199

1720
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:00,199

1721
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:01,799
Good to see ya.

1722
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,999
You're growing up a bit, huh?

1723
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,099
I looked after your lemon tree
just like you told me.

1724
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:07,599
You did, yeah.

1725
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,399
Its doing well isn't it?

1726
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,899
Yeah, its beautiful.

1727
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:14,099
- I fed the chickens.
- You did?

1728
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:16,299
- And mum cooked all the eggs.
- Oh, yeah...

1729
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:18,499

- Yep.

1730
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,434
- Yeah, good. Have you got my key?
- Here it is.

1731
01:59:20,435 --> 01:59:22,199
- Right thanks.
- I took good care of it.

1732
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:24,899
- I knew you would.
- How fast did you go?

1733
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:28,499
Mighty fast. In one of my runs
I did over 200 miles an hour.

1734
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:31,699
What would happen if you opened
your mouth at that speed?

1735
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:35,700
Well, you'd blow the backside
out of your pants I reckon.

1736
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:39,999
Right, lets see.

1737
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Its nice to be home.
Back in my shed.
