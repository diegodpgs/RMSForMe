1
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,056
My darling,

2
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,992
My heart belongs to you.

3
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:06,988
No matter what you've done,
I still love you.

4
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,002
I love you.

5
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:15,997
While you're locked in there
all those years,

6
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:22,003
I'll be locked up out here,
waiting for you.

7
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:31,012
I want to send a letter
to a guy who cheated me.

8
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:37,018
Mr Zé Amaro,
thank you for what you did to me.

9
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:42,023
I trusted you
and you cheated me.

10
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:47,028
You even took the keys
to my apartment.

11
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,042
Dear Jesus,

12
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,047
You're the worst thing
to happen to me.

13
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,984
I'm only writing because
your son Josué asked me to.

14
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,991
I told him you're worthless,

15
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:10,985
and yet,
he still wants to meet you.

16
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,993
-Address?
-Jesus de Paiva.

17
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,006
Sitio Volta da Pedra.

18
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,000
Bom Jesus do Norte,
Pernambuco.

19
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,025
Dalva,

20
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,029
-My hot pussy...
-Pussy?

21
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:50,024
Your body against mine,
rolling around in the motel bed,

22
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,028
our sweat boiling,
me, I still...

23
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,041
-I still feel...
-Infatuated.

24
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,977
-That's it, infatuated!
-I don't know the exact address.

25
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,982
-I need it.
-Okay, then write:.

26
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,975
Third house after the bakery,
Mimoso, Pernambuco.

27
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,989
Cansanção, Bahia.

28
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,991
Carangola, Minas Gerais.

29
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,994
Town of Relutaba, Ceará.

30
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,996
Muzambinho, Minas Gerais.

31
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,005
Hello, Mrs Dora.

32
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,007
-How are you, Mr Pedrão?
-Okay.

33
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:36,004
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

34
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,996
CENTRAL STATION

35
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,999
Irene!

36
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,014
-What?
-Come on up! Now!

37
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,017
-Coming...
-This piece of crap...

38
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,019
is as old as I am, isn't it?

39
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,957
Sit down here.

40
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,964
Not again, Dora.

41
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:11,959
I want you to know that
I disapprove of this, okay?

42
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,963
Here, give me a hand.
Read this one.

43
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,974
I saw your ad
in the personals column

44
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,988
and your description was
the only one that interested me.

45
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:34,982
This jerk wrote the same thing
to ten different women.

46
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,995
I'm tall.

47
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,991
I have brown eyes, straight hair,
and an education.

48
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,995
-They say I'm good-looking.
-He's as ugly as a worm.

49
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,999
Education? He can't even write.

50
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,011
Trash?

51
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,951
Dear Jesus, you're the
worst thing to happen to me.

52
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,955
At least
try and show up for your son,

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,960
-he still wants to meet you.
-She says the boy wants

54
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,964
to meet his father, a drunkard. In
fact, she just wants the guy back.

55
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,968
Don't tear this one up!
The kid wants to...

56
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,982
-meet his dad and reunite the family.
-So what?

57
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:34,976
-You'll ruin it for them.
-He's a drunkard and used to beat her.

58
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,981
-So the boy's to grow up fatherless?
-Better than living with a drunk

59
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:44,986
-who'll beat him. It's decided: trash.
-But isn't it her first letter?

60
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,999
It'll be an exception!

61
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,002
I've had enough of this,
I'm leaving.

62
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:54,996
-He'll smash her face in...
-So? It's not up to you! It's her face.

63
00:07:55,041 --> 00:08:00,946
-Okay, I'll put it in the drawer.
-No, you'll send it tomorrow.

64
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,940
The trash or the drawer... I'll
send it next week if we decide...

65
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,944
Liar! Those letters stay
in that purgatory for years.

66
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:18,953
I'll send it next week.
Sit down. Let's get back to work.

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,960
-You can be a pain in the ass sometimes.
-They say many people often lose...

68
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,965
control during Carnival. I'm one
of them. We both had a good time,

69
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,969
-but let's forget it now."
-Oh, I like this one.

70
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,983
You do?

71
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,987
Really? Really? Really?

72
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:09,937
I haven't heard from home for a while.
I don't think they get my letters.

73
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:15,943
Our postal service sucks, you can't
trust them. Or maybe they've moved.

74
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,958
-You think so?
-One buck, Mr Sergio.

75
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,961
See you, Mrs Dora.

76
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,957
The other day I sent a letter
through you. Remember?

77
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,961
Did you send it?

78
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:38,966
-No, I'm sending it today.
-Good! I want to tear that one up...

79
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:43,971
and send another.
I think I was too hard on him.

80
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:44,983
Go ahead.

81
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,988
Dear Jesus,

82
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,981
Your son Josué wants to meet you.

83
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,986
He wants to visit you
since he don't know you.

84
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,999
Doesn't know...

85
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,992
He doesn't know you
and wants to visit.

86
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:09,997
I'm on vacation next month
and can come with him.

87
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:14,001
Then I can see Moisés and Isaías.

88
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:20,007
You know what... I'm dying to
see that bastard again!

89
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:27,015
-You're experienced, what do I say now?
-How should I know?

90
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:32,019
-Help me, please.
-You think about it and come back.

91
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,033
The truth is,
I still like him a lot.

92
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:44,032
Jesus, I miss you so much. It's awful
to wake up without you next to me.

93
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:51,039
If I had one strand of black hair
left on my head, I'd leave it...

94
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:55,042
-for you to tear out.
-That's great!

95
00:10:56,088 --> 00:11:01,993
Wait for me, I'm coming back.
Love... What's your name?

96
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:02,995
Ana.

97
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,996
-Put this in the letter.
-There, it's in the letter.

98
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,000
-Shall I send it or not?
-Send it. How much?

99
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:24,005
Two bucks...
Minus one for the unsent letter.

100
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:30,011
How do you know she'll send it? She
hasn't even put it in an envelope.

101
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,024
Don't be rude.

102
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,027
-She's helping me.
-Next!

103
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,041
Give me your hand.

104
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,984
Hey, my top!

105
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,990
Come on, Josué!

106
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,010
-What happened?
-A woman got run over by a bus.

107
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,012
Is she dead?

108
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,005
She's gone to meet her Maker.

109
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,025
Mom!

110
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,029
Thank you, ma'am.

111
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,972
I want to send a letter to my father.

112
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,978
Start writing!

113
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:13,974
Dad, come to Rio
because mom's been hurt.

114
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,989
-Got any money?
-Yes.

115
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:18,990
Show me.

116
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,994
Show me.

117
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,988
-Who do you know in Rio?
-My mother.

118
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,992
-Who else?
-Go on, write the letter like I said!

119
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:36,997
-Only if you show me your money.
-Then give me my mother's letter.

120
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,001
I've already sent it.
Now go away.

121
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,005
-Give me the letter!
-I said, scram!

122
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,018
Get out of here.
Move it, kid. Scram!

123
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,978
Come on, beat it!

124
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,947
Get out! Beat it!

125
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:36,977
Hey, kid. Wake up.
Want a sandwich?

126
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:41,982
-Not hungry?
-I've eaten, thanks.

127
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:52,993
Special offer! Today only!
All beauty products one buck!

128
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,997
-Combs half-price!
-Everything's good. I have...

129
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:01,945
so many customers, I can hardly
handle them all. I'm saving up...

130
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,940
to go back to school.

131
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:11,945
Thief! Nab him!
Mr Pedrão!

132
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:16,961
Go get him!

133
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,975
Don't move!

134
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:35,969
Don't move! Don't move.
Shut up! Don't move.

135
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,983
Wait...

136
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,987
don't shoot! I'll return it...

137
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,941
-Good evening, Mrs Dora.
-Evening.

138
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,943
Leaving already?

139
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,951
-Hey, son.
-I'm Josué.

140
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:18,946
Josué, is it? Let me see me your top.
Oh, I see... Your mother told you...

141
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,950
not to talk to strangers.
She's right.

142
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,954
-But you needn't be afraid of me.
-I'm not.

143
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,958
It's all right, Mr. Pedrão.
I know the boy.

144
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,963
Then I'd like to talk to you.

145
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,995
Hey, there...

146
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,991
Josué Fontenele de Paiva. Paiva from
my father, Fontenele from my mother.

147
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,996
How admirable! That's very good.
Mine is Isadora Teixera.

148
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:17,004
Would you like to come home with me,
Josué de Paiva?

149
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:22,009
-I told you, I'm waiting for my mother.
-She won't be coming.

150
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:30,017
-You're lying!
-She won't be coming, son. She's dead.

151
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:37,024
Do you have any relatives
here in Rio?

152
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,037
An aunt?

153
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,042
Answer me.

154
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,040
Look...
Take this.

155
00:20:53,085 --> 00:21:00,992
If you change your mind, you just
follow me. Okay? I mean it.

156
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:35,893
Come in.

157
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,906
Where's your husband?

158
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,908
I don't have one.

159
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,906
-And your children?
-No children, no husband,

160
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,853
-no family, no dog.
-Then I can use the bathroom?

161
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,857
-Go ahead.
-Where is it?

162
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,859
Over there.

163
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:22,863
It's hot as hell today!
I'll go freshen up in the bathroom.

164
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,877
I have a guest this evening.

165
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,888
This is Josué.

166
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,896
Was it good?

167
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:52,893
-See what a demanding guest he is?
-His mother's cooking was better.

168
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,907
No, she was a lousy cook, too.

169
00:22:55,941 --> 00:23:00,844
Hey, you should be a little
more grateful... you brat.

170
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:10,844
-Irene, what kind of work do you do?
-Guess.

171
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:16,850
You seem like a teacher, like Dora.
Except that she's a letter writer.

172
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,865
You're right,
we used to be teachers.

173
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,860
-You've no husband either?
-Neither of us.

174
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:31,865
-So who takes care of you?
-We look after ourselves.

175
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,869
Your mother lived on her own.
Who took care of her?

176
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,882
Me, of course!

177
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,886
And your father
never showed his face?

178
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,882
He works too much.
He's a carpenter.

179
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:54,888
He works with wood. He makes
tables, chairs, doors, tops...

180
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,892
-houses... all by himself.
-Wasn't his father a...

181
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:04,842
-Well, what do you want to do?
-I'm going to be a truck driver.

182
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:09,836
Our fathers used to drive big trains.

183
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:13,840
Yeah, and they were drunkards, too.
It sucked.

184
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,857
You okay, Josué?

185
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:26,847
What are you doing?
You sneaky rat!

186
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:33,854
Can you read? You think
I won't mail your mother's letter?

187
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,858
Well, you're wrong, kid.
It's been so hectic...

188
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:42,863
-I haven't had the time yet.
-Give it, I'll take it to my father.

189
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:48,869
Are you crazy? Do you know where he
lives? Far away, on another planet!

190
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:53,874
-I'll get there!
-You'll never get there. Never.

191
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,880
I think the best thing is if I mail it
tomorrow. I promise I will.

192
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,835
Do you swear you promise?

193
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:22,836
-I swear I promise.
-You're not going to lie again?

194
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:26,851
No.

195
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:53,868
-Where are we going?
-You're going to a great place.

196
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,821
-Hello, Mr Pedrão.
-Hello, Mrs Dora. Hi there, son.

197
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,834
We're late.

198
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,839
Hello, Pedrão. Please come in.

199
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:38,845
-Yolanda, this is Mrs Dora.
-Nice to meet you.

200
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,849
Now, I'm not sure what he's told you,
but as you can see...

201
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,853
we treat our children
as if we were one big family.

202
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:50,857
They'll all be going to wealthy
families in Europe, the States...

203
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:55,862
Once you're loaded with dollars,
you won't forget us, right?

204
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,876
Let aunty see your tongue now.

205
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,812
-Go on.
-It's okay to be rude.

206
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,816
-That's it, great!
-I'd like more information.

207
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,809
We'll talk about it.
What's your name again?

208
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,825
Tell me, Josué...

209
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:19,819
Are you into video games?
And would you like an ice cream?

210
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,823
-No, thanks.
-Then let's go play with Shirlene.

211
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,830
This is for you.
Pedrão told you how much...

212
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,843
$2000.

213
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,846
-$1 000 for you.
-$1 000.

214
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,854
It's all there.

215
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,858
Bye, Josué.

216
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:14,808
Oh, my goodness!
Blessed Virgin, mother of God!

217
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,822
We made it to the remote control age!

218
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,815
-Is it in stereo?
-But this stupid thing doesn't work.

219
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,829
Maybe the batteries are dead.

220
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,832
How'd it go with Josué
at the Juvenile Division?

221
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:31,825
Very well. He'll be in one
of the best children's institutions.

222
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,839
-I talked to the judge.
-Which institution?

223
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:39,833
The Padre Jesuino Vidal Foundation in
Pelotas, state of Rio Grande do Sul.

224
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,837
But I thought he'd be nearby
so we could see him.

225
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,841
It'll give you a chance to
visit Pelotas, you love to travel.

226
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:51,845
-This thing doesn't work.
-No, Dora. Like this.

227
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,862
Can I go see him
in the Juvenile Division?

228
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,855
No, I think he must've already
left for Pelotas.

229
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,864
Where did you get the money
to buy that TV?

230
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,880
-I sold a gold ring a while back.
-You're lying...

231
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,873
Otherwise,
you wouldn't bother to explain.

232
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:25,879
Right, I'm lying! You know everything
about my life! Now let's watch TV.

233
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:30,884
Where did you get the money?
Tell me the truth. Please...

234
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:37,891
A friend at the station knows people
who find families to adopt children.

235
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,897
-I can't believe you did that!
-He'll be better off.

236
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,910
Better than in an institution here.

237
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:52,907
Don't you read the papers? They aren't
adopted. Their organs are sold.

238
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,919
It's not that at all, I went there!

239
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,922
He's too old to be adopted, Dora.

240
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:02,859
Damn it, Irene! I've had enough of
you! Let's just leave it, all right?

241
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,865
There's a limit to everything, Dora.

242
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,876
-Hi.
-Hi...

243
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,878
-I was here yesterday.
-Yes...

244
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:33,873
It occurred to me afterwards that you
might be interested in other children.

245
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,887
We don't need any more right now.

246
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,890
They're lovely children,
have a look. Look at this one...

247
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,893
Yolanda! Who is it?

248
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:03,846
Hold on,
I'll have a word with my partner.

249
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,866
Let me sleep, damn it...

250
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,859
But look how many...
This one's so cute.

251
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,873
She's on to something.

252
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:34,867
What kind of work is this?
We're not a 24-hour pharmacy here!

253
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:40,873
-I never said we were...
- Yesterday I went to bed at dawn.

254
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:45,878
-After you got me into that big mess.
- You're always complaining.

255
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,882
You're a born complainer. If you're
not happy, you can get out!

256
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:57,890
-Quick! Josué, wake up! Hurry!
-What are you doing here? Go away!

257
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,903
-Let's go.
-No!

258
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,838
-Come with me.
-Liar! Go away.

259
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,843
-Come on.
-No, you're no good!

260
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,846
-Hush!
-I'll call Yolanda.

261
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,848
You'll call no one

262
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,843
What's going on? The bitch!
You old cow, I'll get you!

263
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,855
-You'll die, you fucking bitch!
-Old bag! Sleaze!

264
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:35,863
I'll get you! I'm going to kill you!
You goddam bitch! You're already dead!

265
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,876
Esperanto Street, in Cascadura.

266
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,893
I'm sorry, I've changed my mind.

267
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,896
Hello?

268
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,830
-Who is this?
-Guess.

269
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:04,824
-I'm glad you called.
-Irene, listen carefully.

270
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:09,829
If a big guy with a mustache
comes around asking for me, you scram!

271
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:14,834
And don't you invite him
in for coffee, okay?

272
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,848
-Well, actually...
-I don 't believe it.

273
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,851
Yes...

274
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,854
He's there?

275
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,848
If he is, say something crazy.

276
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:35,855
Milton, I can't see you, I've made
plans to go dancing with a friend.

277
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,870
Say no more.

278
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,874
Where are you, Milton?
At the barracks?

279
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,876
I'm at the bus station.

280
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,878
And I'm in deep shit!

281
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:55,875
Is that cute little friend of yours
on duty with you?

282
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,889
Josué's with me.
I've taken him away.

283
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,824
I always knew
you were a good soldier.

284
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:07,820
Irene, do me a favor. Lock up my
apartment. Got that? Lock it up.

285
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,834
And watch out for yourself.

286
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,837
-One last favor.
-What is it?

287
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:18,831
Could you lend me 200 bucks? Send to
Bank of Brazil in Bom Jesus do Norte.

288
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,855
Here's your ticket.
We'll be off soon.

289
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,858
Take it, kid.

290
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,861
I'm trying to help.

291
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:41,854
-I'll go by myself.
-I'm going with you.

292
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,868
-I don't want you along.
-Why not?

293
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:49,862
-Because I don't like you.
-Why not?

294
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,876
Like I said, you're no good.

295
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,883
How will you get there, then?

296
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,819
Give me some money for food.

297
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:07,813
When I get there,
my dad'll pay you back.

298
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,817
-Stupid idiot...
-Give me my mother's letter.

299
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:52,863
What's the shirt for?
Getting married?

300
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,866
It's for when I meet my father.

301
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,799
What are you looking at? Go back
to the bus, I've something to buy.

302
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,820
-Is it far still?
-What?

303
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:21,814
-My father's house.
-Watch for the road signs...

304
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,827
they'll tell you.

305
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:34,827
-How do they measure a kilometer?
-A kilometer is a kilometer.

306
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,831
-1 000 meters.
-I know. But how can they be sure?

307
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,835
-How do they count them?
-They make it up.

308
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,877
Do you think that man is a father?

309
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,870
-What?
-That man there.

310
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,884
Do you think that man there
has children?

311
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,892
He doesn't look like a father.

312
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,896
But this one does.

313
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,899
I know the type.

314
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,901
Just like my father.

315
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,904
A saint in the house
and a real prick outside.

316
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,897
Someone once said:
"Are you Dildo's daughter?"

317
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:49,902
That was what they called him:
"Dildo".

318
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,918
Prick! Prick!

319
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:02,858
I don't like riding the bus,
I prefer taxis.

320
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:07,853
You shouldn't. You should always
take the bus, not a taxi.

321
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:11,857
The bus has a defined route
with definite stops,

322
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,871
while a taxi can take
any route and then gets lost.

323
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,873
Why?

324
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:21,867
That was in a letter my dad wrote to
my mom saying he was tired...

325
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:25,871
of riding the same bus everyday,
meaning my mother,

326
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:29,875
and he'd decided to take a taxi,
meaning another woman.

327
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:35,881
But my mother took a taxi, too,
a space taxi...

328
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:40,886
She died when I was your age.

329
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:49,889
-Get back to your seat.
-I'm Josué Fontenele de Paiva. Paiva...

330
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,903
-from father, Fontenele from mother.
-Look at that, folks!

331
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,906
The kid's fucking drunk!

332
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,899
-Prick!
-You drunkard!

333
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,844
The old bag's drunk!

334
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:05,838
Fucking hell! If I were your mother,
I'd let you have it!

335
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:09,842
-You're not, you're not related to me!
-You'll end up a drunk like your father.

336
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,856
Just like you!
Why'd you come with me anyway?

337
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,858
I wanted to help.

338
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,860
Hear that?

339
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,862
I wanted to help you!

340
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,888
Benemerência!
Ten minutes.

341
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:24,850
Excuse me, please. I'm with my nephew
who's meeting his father...

342
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:28,854
in Bom Jesus do Norte.
This is as far as I go, however.

343
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:33,859
Could you make sure
the boy gets to this address?

344
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:38,864
I don't know, it's complicated.
What if something happens to him?

345
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,877
Wait a minute...

346
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:45,871
This is for you.
Go on. Please take it.

347
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:59,885
-A ticket for Rio.
-Sixty bucks.

348
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,868
You should have
stayed on that bus.

349
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,882
You were right,
you're better off without me.

350
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,888
I'd arranged everything for you.

351
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,824
Why don't you want to
leave me now?

352
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:10,823
If you want to talk,
I'll be over here.

353
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,845
Where's your backpack?

354
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,848
Where is it, kid?

355
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:29,842
Don't tell me
you left it on the bus!

356
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:15,821
I've decided not to go to Rio.
Can I get a refund for my ticket?

357
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,835
I can't refund
your money now, ma'am.

358
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:22,828
The bus to Rio just left.

359
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,850
-Want some?
-No, thanks.

360
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:34,851
Yes... Thank you.

361
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:40,846
Here, help me out.
I can't eat all of this.

362
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,862
You don't look well.

363
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:50,856
It's my heart,
it's suddenly sped up.

364
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,860
With your little finger,
press in time to your heartbeat.

365
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:56,873
Like this?

366
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,814
STRENGTH IS lN EVERYTHlNG,
BUT ONLY GOD IS POWER

367
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,814
Going to Bom Jesus
to fulfil a vow regarding the boy?

368
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,827
Yeah, talk about a vow!

369
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,831
Where do you live?

370
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,834
Here.

371
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,839
And your wife?

372
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:34,833
Here we go again!
Why do you always ask that?

373
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,839
I'm married to the road.
I have no family.

374
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,854
So you're like her.

375
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:06,798
Please excuse me, I've got to unload.
I'll be about 20 minutes.

376
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,812
Give the man a hand, Josué.

377
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:20,812
Nice to see you, Mr Bené! Long time
no see! How long has it been now?

378
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:31,823
I'll get the other one.
You can stay here.

379
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:54,846
The boys and girls of today
are being converted at young age.

380
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:59,851
It's wonderful. They're a generation
raised in the values of Christ.

381
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:05,857
I always see them in church now
wherever I go things have changed.

382
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:10,862
They'll be living
in a different world,

383
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:14,866
more in keeping with God's will.
There's a Reverend...

384
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,870
who's been inspiring them.

385
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:33,885
-What've you got?
-Let's go eat in the truck.

386
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:39,891
For Christ's sake, kid...
Put it in my bag! Right now!

387
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:42,905
-I'll take it back.
-Why?

388
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:47,899
Go on. If your father knew,
he'd thrash you! Want to go to jail?

389
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:51,903
Put that in here and
go wait for me in the truck!

390
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:57,909
I'll try my best to bring
that Reverend here in two weeks.

391
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:02,857
We'll see what he can do
for the youngsters in our parish.

392
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,862
Ma'am! May I see
what's in your bag?

393
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,865
You heard me,
let me see what's in your bag.

394
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:14,860
-She's a friend, Mr Bené.
-Show the bag. The matter's settled.

395
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:19,865
Bené, even though we're friends
and we're brothers in faith...

396
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:25,871
I won't let you humiliate
a woman I know, my friend... Joana.

397
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,877
Okay, it's all right.

398
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,890
I must've been mistaken.

399
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,883
-Thank you.
-Don't you want to get anything?

400
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,887
There's nothing worth
buying here.

401
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,904
Don't you ever do that again.

402
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:52,898
All you had to do was ask. Look what
I got with the money I had left.

403
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:56,902
I even had enough to buy this.

404
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,916
You didn't have any money left.

405
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,851
I did, too.
Here, eat this.

406
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,854
-Liar!
-What?

407
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:08,847
You didn't buy anything,
you stole even more.

408
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:14,853
-Show some respect, I'd be your mother.
-My mother wouldn't steal...

409
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:19,858
-or drink like you.
-Yeah, your father's the one who drank.

410
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:24,863
No! He built the house and
he can make anything out of wood.

411
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:28,867
Your father was a drunkard, boy.
Know what that is, a drunkard?

412
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:32,871
You're a liar and so ugly
no one will marry you!

413
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:37,876
You look like a man, don't even paint
your face. You're not like Irene.

414
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:42,881
Even with tons of paint
on her face, she didn't marry.

415
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,890
-You should always steal sausage.
-I hate sausage.

416
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,844
-Would you like some?
-No, thanks.

417
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:07,839
I'm sorry about what happened
back in the store, Mrs...

418
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:11,843
Dora. But I liked "Joana".

419
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,856
Have some.

420
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:18,850
Mr Bené is a good guy,
but he tends to be suspicious.

421
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,868
WITH GOD I FOLLOW MY DESTINY

422
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:32,864
The boy wants to be a trucker
when he grows up.

423
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,878
Then you'll have to carry
a lot of flour...

424
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:39,871
To buy a truck like this,
you think it's cheap?

425
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,875
This is a small one, I want
a huge one with a turbo engine.

426
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:50,882
Could you let the kid
get behind the wheel?

427
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:59,892
Sit over here. Careful now,
don't hit the accelerator.

428
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,872
It can get cold here in the Sertão.

429
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,875
Coming!

430
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:46,871
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Vitória da Conquista.

431
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:51,876
But I left there a long time ago.
Since I've been on the road,

432
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:56,881
I feel like I've changed my life
ten times over.

433
00:54:56,926 --> 00:55:01,829
You meet many people and then you
never see them again. You two...

434
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:06,825
for example. We'll probably
never see each other again.

435
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:12,831
We don't have to lose contact.

436
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,848
I'm cold!

437
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:21,851
I'm coming!

438
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,857
Excuse me...

439
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,829
In Rio, I had two girlfriends.

440
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:25,837
Did you know that in Rio
all women have sex before marriage?

441
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,851
All of them.

442
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,857
-What'll you have?
-We're just keeping him company.

443
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:50,862
Not at all. I insist on treating you.
Make that three portions.

444
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,866
-And I'll have water... What about you?
-A beer.

445
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,880
And your son?

446
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,819
A Coke.

447
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:12,817
-What do you do, Dora?
-I was an elementary school teacher.

448
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:16,821
No, she's a letter writer. She makes
money writing letters for people.

449
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:21,826
After I retired,

450
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:26,831
I started doing that
to help make ends meet.

451
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,847
Don't you like table football?
Go and play.

452
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,853
Go play, kid!

453
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:55,860
No, I can't have any.

454
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,875
I'm an Evangelist.

455
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:08,807
I'm sure He's not watching you
up there.

456
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,838
I want to tell you something.

457
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:35,834
I'm really glad I missed that bus.
Really glad.

458
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,797
Listen, I'll be back
in just a second.

459
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,840
-Could I borrow your lipstick?
-It's almost finished, keep it.

460
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:49,852
Thank you.

461
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,918
Why did César leave?

462
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:01,856
Don't you have an answer
to that, like you usually do?

463
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:08,853
He got scared. He's one
of those queer men, isn't he?

464
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,869
No... He isn't.

465
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:16,872
Can I tell you something?

466
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:21,866
You look a lot prettier
with lipstick on.

467
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,887
-Good afternoon.
-Afternoon.

468
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:37,882
-You wouldn't be going to Bom Jesus?
-I am, but it's far, it'll cost you...

469
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,895
ten bucks per person.

470
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,879
My mother taught me that.

471
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,889
Want some?

472
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,892
-No, thank you.
-Yes, thanks.

473
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:47,885
Sure, you're a growing boy.
How many under the belt?

474
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,889
-I'm nine.
-At that age, I could've ate a cow.

475
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,894
-Have some, it's good.
-No, got too many under the belt!

476
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,908
Too bad...

477
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:35,867
Mom always said dad would show me
the Sertão one day.

478
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,885
I wonder where she is now?

479
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:51,883
Do you think
they gave her a decent funeral?

480
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,899
Come on, come with me.

481
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,861
Put your mother's
handkerchief there.

482
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:23,841
-Are we going to my father's house?
-Yes. Are you happy?

483
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:30,859
What's the matter?

484
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:34,863
Don't tell me
you've changed your mind now.

485
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:39,857
I don't want him to see me
all dirty, like a beggar.

486
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:44,862
Your father will like you, Josué.
Don't worry.

487
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:47,876
The problem is...

488
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,878
-will you like him?
-I do like him.

489
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:55,873
Listen... Your father's not
the person you think he is.

490
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:59,877
You don't know him,
he built our house...

491
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:04,825
I know! I know all that by heart.
You'll soon be with your father...

492
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:09,820
If you like, I can ask if you can
stay with us for a few days.

493
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,838
Do you know where this is?

494
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:31,853
Go on, Josué.

495
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,814
Ma! There's a boy here.

496
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,830
-Anybody there?
-Yes?

497
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:22,827
-Does Jesus live here?
-Yes. Would you like to see him?

498
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:30,836
-Yes, is he home?
-He's gone out. You can wait. Come in.

499
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,848
-Thank you.
-Afternoon.

500
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,851
She's here to see your husband.

501
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:42,847
-Did you offer her coffee?
-No, thanks.

502
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:57,862
Could I know
why you want to see my husband?

503
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:01,809
I'm sorry...
I can only tell him.

504
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:44,842
Your friends have been waiting...
to see you.

505
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:48,846
I've come from Rio.

506
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:53,851
I must talk to you in private.

507
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:57,855
Okay. Maria, mother,
please excuse us.

508
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:04,795
Go on, boy! Get out!

509
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:09,800
-Tell me.
-I've brought this boy to you.

510
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,814
His mother died.

511
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:17,808
He's got no one else but you now.

512
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:22,813
-What's your relation to him?
-We're not related.

513
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:28,830
Why did you bring him here, then?

514
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:32,823
Let's just say
we're friends.

515
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,837
Is he a good boy?

516
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,842
Yes...

517
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,845
He's a good boy.

518
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:50,852
This letter is for you.

519
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:58,849
That's not me. I'm Jessé.
The letter's for Jesus...

520
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:03,854
who used to live here.
Wait a second.

521
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:15,866
Here, this is his new address
in the new settlements.

522
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:20,871
He won a house in a lottery
and so he sold this one. But...

523
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:25,876
Let me tell you...
He drank it away, house and all.

524
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:04,858
-Dora! Everything okay?
-Did you send the money like I asked?

525
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:08,852
Yes, the money's already there
in Bom Jesus da Lapa.

526
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,866
Bom Jesus where?

527
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,869
Isn't it "da Lapa"?

528
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:32,876
I found no truck to get away
from this godawful pilgrimage.

529
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:36,880
-Where are we going?
-To hitch a ride on the road.

530
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,893
-We're walking?
-Yeah, walking!

531
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:44,888
Hell! What did I ever do to God to
deserve this? You're my punishment.

532
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:50,894
-I'm hungry.
-You think you're the only one?

533
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:53,908
We've no money, no food,
nothing left!

534
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:58,902
-Understand? Nothing!
-What's us going to do?

535
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:05,853
I don't know. I don't know. Your
parents should never have had you.

536
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:10,848
Now it's me who has to put up with
you. You're a curse, you're a curse!

537
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:14,852
Oh, hell!

538
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,860
Where are you going!
Come back!

539
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:28,877
Come back here!

540
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:01,842
Thank you!

541
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:05,836
Thank you, Jesus.

542
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:10,841
Here I am, Lord. I beg of you,
I'm praying with...

543
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:15,846
all my heart,
with all my soul, Jesus.

544
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:21,852
I'm a Franciscan from the bottom
of my heart. Oh, Jesus...

545
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:26,857
-Bless my people! Bless my pilgrims.
-I'm a sinner, Jesus!

546
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:31,862
For the blood of Christ! Look at the hardships...

547
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:36,867
I must bear! I suffer
in my flesh, my bone...

548
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:42,873
my blood, in my body,
like our Lord, Jesus Christ!

549
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:50,881
Protect me, mother! Bless me, mother
for the blood of the Holy Ghost.

550
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:37,861
Burn, Lord! Burn...
Flood the darkness with light, Lord!

551
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:54,878
Let us keep away evil...
and let the light come through!

552
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:05,834
Josué!

553
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:25,836
This commerce, this madman's fair, is
the fair of the devil and the...

554
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:32,844
merchants of the temple, this is the
carnival of Satan! He's down below...

555
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:37,848
jumping for joy! The evil beast
roars with laughter at...

556
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,866
the sight of such shamelessness!

557
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:09,813
For a few coins,
I'll tell your fortune.

558
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:12,827
-I've no more money.
-You pay me what I deserve.

559
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:16,820
-I've no more money.
-You pay if I deserve it. What a pest!

560
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,843
Where are you going, Josué?

561
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:36,840
Sir, how much is a photo
with the saint?

562
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,854
It's three bucks.

563
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:40,855
That much?

564
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:44,848
-That's the price...
-Does it include message to the saint?

565
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:48,852
No, only the photo of you
and the saint.

566
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,865
Don't want it?

567
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,868
Josué, what are you doing
at this stall?

568
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:57,861
Miss! She's a writer.
She'll send the saint a message.

569
01:17:57,906 --> 01:17:59,874
Can you?

570
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,810
Only one buck.

571
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:07,804
Letters! Send a letter home,
a message to a saint!

572
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:13,810
Letters! Only one buck!

573
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,827
How much to send a message?

574
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:22,830
-One buck.
-One buck?

575
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:26,823
Two, if you want us to post it.

576
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:30,827
-Holy shit!
-lf it's okay, wait in line.

577
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:39,847
Is that right? Shall I start?

578
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:44,841
Criseldinha,
I've come here from Itabaiana.

579
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:49,846
I walked all the way,
along the road.

580
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:53,850
I'm fulfilling the vow I made
to come here...

581
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,864
if Benício agreed to marry me.

582
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,800
Thank you, Jesus,
for answering my prayers.

583
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,804
My husband has stopped drinking.

584
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:09,811
Leontina Emerentina,

585
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:17,808
I am now the happiest man
in the world.

586
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:28,819
-How long has he been away?
-Four years.

587
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:30,832
-You've had no news at all?
-No.

588
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:33,835
Love to mother,
Maria Adalgiza Bezerra.

589
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:37,828
Josefa Maria da Silva
in São Bento do Una.

590
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,832
To my fiancé, João Pedro da Silva,
in São Paulo.

591
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,846
To our father,
José Alves da Silva...

592
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,840
Thank you, baby Jesus, for answering
our prayers. Thank you for bringing...

593
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:56,848
us rain. I came to Bom Jesus and set
off ten colored rockets in your honor.

594
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:01,852
Sebastiano. Here you are.

595
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:06,868
Your letter.

596
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:09,871
We're rich.

597
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,873
We can even eat.

598
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,886
Let's shake.
I'll shake you up!

599
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:32,894
Come on, let's go!

600
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:38,889
I'll get you this dress
as a present.

601
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,902
-For me?
-Yes, for you.

602
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:43,905
-How much is it?
-Five bucks.

603
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:50,901
You'll look much nicer
in that dress.

604
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:57,919
I'm beat.

605
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:30,875
-No, don't do that.
-Should we tear them up first?

606
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,888
Give them to me.

607
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:37,892
I'll do something with them later.

608
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:52,896
Will we look for my dad tomorrow?

609
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:57,901
Yes, there's a bus that leaves at
lunchtime. Come, you can sleep here.

610
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:02,849
-Good night, Josué.
-Night, Dora.

611
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:08,845
-Do you always go to bed like that?
-You don't expect me to sleep naked?

612
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:13,850
-Sleeping naked is much nicer.
-Well, take off your clothes if...

613
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:17,854
you like. I don't mind.
What? Are you embarrassed?

614
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:21,858
I bet you've never seen
a woman naked.

615
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:25,862
-I've seen loads.
-Sure, your mother.

616
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:29,866
Not true! I've seen other women.

617
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:35,872
-You might've seen, but only that.
-I had sex with them.

618
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:40,877
-Oh, you did? How did you do it?
-It's not something to...

619
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:45,882
-discuss with women.
-So I've got a real man...

620
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:47,895
in my bed!

621
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:58,895
How long will it take to get there?
How long?

622
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:08,838
Stay here, I'll be right back.

623
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:28,858
Dora! The bus!

624
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:44,885
It's packed.

625
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,852
Could you tell me where F Street is?

626
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:28,853
-Hey you! Where's F Street?
-That's the new street...

627
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:32,856
the paved one.
It's that way.

628
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:42,866
-They're all the same.
-Yeah, you're right.

629
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,882
-Did your mom have your dad's photo?
-Yes.

630
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:53,877
-Can you remember his face?
-Sometimes I can remember...

631
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,891
but then it gets blurry.

632
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,829
I forget my father's face, too.

633
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:10,827
Damn photos shouldn't be there to
remind us. We should be able to forget.

634
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:19,836
I left home at sixteen, and never saw
my father again... Except for once...

635
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:25,842
years later, I saw him in the street.
I froze, then found the courage...

636
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:33,851
to go up to him. "Remember me?" I
said. "Do you recognize me?"

637
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:38,855
I could see he hadn't recognized me.
He didn't recognize...

638
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,869
his own daughter.
He said:

639
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:45,862
"How could I have forgotten
such a lovely girl like you?"

640
01:25:45,907 --> 01:25:51,868
I told the rat
I'd made a mistake and left.

641
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:58,875
I heard he died soon afterwards.
You understand?

642
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,822
-What did I do?
-You'll soon forget me, too.

643
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:08,818
-I don't want to forget you.
-Even so... you will.

644
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:21,842
Mr Jesus!

645
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:30,840
Jesus doesn't live here anymore.

646
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:38,848
-Do you know where he lives?
-No. Vanished into the wilderness...

647
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:41,862
no one's heard from him since.

648
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:47,868
Thank you.

649
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:04,817
So he'll never come back?

650
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:09,812
-I don't think so.
-I'll wait for him.

651
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:15,818
It's no use, Josué.
He's not coming back.

652
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:25,828
Why don't you come with me?

653
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:30,833
I'd really like that, kid.
You know that.

654
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:33,847
I really would.

655
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:40,854
Let's go.

656
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:58,861
-The father's vanished.
-What are you going to do?

657
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:03,809
-I can't leave the boy here on his own.
-Of course not.

658
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:06,814
You know him,
he's really a good kid.

659
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:10,807
Are you coming home with him?

660
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:13,821
-I'm not sure what to do.
-What do you mean?

661
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:18,815
I've made so many mistakes in Rio,
you know that, Irene.

662
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:25,823
-So what are you going to do?
-I want you to sell my fridge and...

663
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:29,826
-my sofa... What else have I got?
-The TV?

664
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:31,839
Yeah, sell the goddam TV.

665
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:33,841
What are you going to do?

666
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:37,834
When I'm settled somewhere,
I'll call you.

667
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:42,850
Two tickets back to Bom Jesus,
please.

668
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,853
Not till tomorrow morning.

669
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,855
What about to somewhere else?

670
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:52,849
Nothing till tomorrow.
This is the end of the world here.

671
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:56,853
-How do I get out of here?
-Tomorrow.

672
01:28:57,899 --> 01:28:59,867
Not till tomorrow.

673
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:08,798
Okay... Two tickets for
the first bus tomorrow morning.

674
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:22,812
Are you looking for my father?

675
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:25,826
-Your father?
-Yes, Jesus. I was told...

676
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:29,819
-some strangers were looking for him.
-That's right.

677
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:35,825
-Do you know him?
-I'm a friend of his.

678
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:41,831
-What a coincidence, meeting his son.
-Not really...

679
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:47,837
given the size of this place.
Nice to meet you. I'm Isaías.

680
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:53,843
-Nice to meet you, Isaías.
-Are you visiting?

681
01:29:54,889 --> 01:30:00,850
I was in the area and I remembered
an old friend who lived here.

682
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:04,854
Then you must come to the house
for a bite.

683
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:08,858
People don't often come to visit dad.
I insist...

684
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:12,862
You're not going to refuse me.
And who's this?

685
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:16,866
-What's your name?
-Geraldo.

686
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:19,880
Geraldo, Mrs Dora, please.

687
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:22,883
I insist. Come...

688
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:38,888
Come here, Geraldo.
Know what a tongue twister is?

689
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,902
"Peter Piper picked

690
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:44,905
a peck of pickled peppers."
Now you say it.

691
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:47,908
"Peter pecked a pick of paper..."

692
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:49,910
What a dope!

693
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:52,913
This is where me and
my brother moved...

694
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:57,907
after father left. Moisés!
Guests from far away!

695
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:14,857
Moisés, this is Mrs Dora,
a friend of father's. Imagine!

696
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:18,861
-Hello...
-Hello.

697
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:22,876
Mrs Dora, how
long is it to get here?

698
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,878
It depends on the way you come.

699
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:28,871
Moisés is dying to see Rio. They
say it's nice...

700
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:33,876
-but full of crooks.
-You find crooks everywhere.

701
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:37,880
We took this land and are squatting it,
Mrs Dora. All of it. We took this...

702
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:42,885
house after dad lost the other, and
put in this carpentry workshop.

703
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:45,899
Moisés grinds away here
all day long.

704
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:48,902
He's even better than father now.

705
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:56,900
He can make tables, chairs, everything.
We even sell things to the capital.

706
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:10,858
Go on, Geraldo.
You can get closer.

707
01:32:43,925 --> 01:32:45,893
Hey, the kid plays pretty well!

708
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:49,886
No praise,
his head's already big enough!

709
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:53,890
I play okay,
it's just that they're lousy!

710
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:15,845
Give it to her...
She can read it for us.

711
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:19,860
What's she got to do with it?

712
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:24,854
She's dad's friend. We can trust her.
Show it to her, please.

713
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:36,877
Then I'll get it.

714
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:41,882
All right, get that damned letter.

715
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:56,886
This came six months ago, from dad to
Ana Fontenele. She was the woman...

716
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:59,900
he was with after mother died.

717
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:02,835
Nine years ago, Ana Fontenele took
off to Rio. She was expecting...

718
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:06,829
-our little brother.
-Dad waited two years for her...

719
01:34:06,874 --> 01:34:12,835
to come back. He stopped working
and started drinking all the time.

720
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,839
He sold the house to pay his debts.

721
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:21,844
One day, I woke up to find dad gone
and a half-empty bottle...

722
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:26,849
on the table. That worried me. For dad
to leave a bottle half empty...

723
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:32,855
something serious must have happened.
He vanished, but it was better for us.

724
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:36,859
We saved money...
Our lives improved.

725
01:34:36,904 --> 01:34:40,863
-Don't say that, Moisés.
-I will say it!

726
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:44,867
You know father...
He's an okay guy.

727
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:48,871
Okay?
I'm going to ask her to read it.

728
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:51,885
Yes, ask her.

729
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:58,881
It's a letter to Ana, not to us.
Dad never cared about us.

730
01:34:58,926 --> 01:35:02,828
But Ana never came back,
so we can open it.

731
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:07,834
You don't mind reading it to us,
do you?

732
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:09,836
Not at all.

733
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:35,862
So? It says where he is?

734
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:37,864
Go on, read it.

735
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,868
"Ana,

736
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:51,868
my misfortune. It was hard to find
a letter writer to tell you...

737
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:55,871
that I finally understood
that you went back...

738
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,885
and found our new little house,

739
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,819
while I'm here in Rio

740
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:03,824
Looking for you.

741
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:10,820
I hope I get back before this letter,
but if it arrives before me,

742
01:36:10,865 --> 01:36:13,834
do as I say:

743
01:36:13,868 --> 01:36:17,827
wait for me.
I'll be coming home, too."

744
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:20,841
The letter arrived
six months ago.

745
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:23,844
He's been held up.

746
01:36:23,878 --> 01:36:27,837
"I left Moisés and Isaías
to look after things."

747
01:36:27,882 --> 01:36:31,841
To look after things?
That's a joke!

748
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:37,847
"Ana, I may work in the mines for
a month before coming home,

749
01:36:37,892 --> 01:36:40,861
but I'll be back. Please wait.

750
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:44,865
Then we'll all be together:

751
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:46,867
me, you,

752
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:48,869
Isaías,

753
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:51,872
Moisés,

754
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:58,879
and Josué...

755
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,818
...and Josué,

756
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:06,820
who I can't wait to meet.

757
01:37:10,858 --> 01:37:15,818
You're a bad-tempered mule,
but I'd give all I have to...

758
01:37:15,863 --> 01:37:18,832
see you again.

759
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:21,835
Forgive me.

760
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:25,839
It's you and me, for life.

761
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,843
Jesus."

762
01:37:34,882 --> 01:37:36,850
He'll be back.

763
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:39,853
No, he won't.

764
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:42,856
Yes, he will, one day.

765
01:37:57,905 --> 01:38:03,810
Did my father really say
he wanted to meet me?

766
01:38:04,845 --> 01:38:10,806
-Of course he did.
-I know he didn't.

767
01:38:13,854 --> 01:38:18,814
Hey, folks. Come inside. I fixed up
dad's bedroom for you, Mrs Dora.

768
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:21,828
Thank you.

769
01:38:21,862 --> 01:38:24,831
-Tongue twister, boy.
-Again?

770
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:29,825
Say five times very quickly:
"How now brown cow." Now say it.

771
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:33,829
"Say five times very quickly..."

772
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:36,843
You dope!

773
01:42:57,938 --> 01:43:02,841
Josué, I haven't sent a letter
to anyone for a while,

774
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:05,845
but I'm sending you this one now.

775
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,839
You were right. Your father will
come back, and he surely is...

776
01:43:10,884 --> 01:43:14,843
all you say he is.

777
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:21,850
I remember riding with
my father in his train.

778
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:26,855
I was just a little girl, but he let
me blow the whistle the whole time.

779
01:43:28,902 --> 01:43:32,861
When you're driving down the road
in your big truck,

780
01:43:32,906 --> 01:43:38,867
remember that I was the first person
to have you put your hand on the wheel.

781
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:46,875
It will be better for you
to stay with your brothers.

782
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:50,879
You deserve much more
than I can give you.

783
01:43:52,926 --> 01:43:56,885
If you miss me one day,
look at the picture...

784
01:43:56,930 --> 01:43:59,899
we took together.

785
01:43:59,933 --> 01:44:05,838
I'm telling you this because
I'm afraid you too may forget me.

786
01:44:05,872 --> 01:44:10,832
I long for my father.
I long for everything.

787
01:44:11,878 --> 01:44:12,845
Dora.
