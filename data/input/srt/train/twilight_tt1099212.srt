1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,747
<i>I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.</i>

2
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:37,797
<i>But dying in the place of someone I love
seems like a good way to go.</i>

3
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:14,560
<i>So I can't bring myself
to regret the decision to leave home.</i>

4
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:18,202
<i>I would miss Phoenix.</i>

5
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,338
<i>I'd miss the heat.</i>

6
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:28,481
<i>I would miss my loving, erratic,
harebrained mother.</i>

7
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,779
Okay.

8
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,711
<i>And her new husband.</i>

9
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:35,552
Guys, come on. I love you both.
We got a plane to catch.

10
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:40,220
<i>But they want to go on the road,
so I'm gonna spend some time with my dad,</i>

11
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:42,927
<i>and this will be a good thing.</i>

12
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:45,800
<i>I think.</i>

13
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:49,604
<i>When the thorn bush turns white</i>

14
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:55,872
<i>That's when I'll come home</i>

15
00:01:55,945 --> 00:02:02,908
<i>I am going out to see what I can sow</i>

16
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:09,616
<i>And I don't know where I'll go</i>

17
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:12,991
<i>And I don't know what I'll see</i>

18
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,461
<i>In the state of Washington,</i>

19
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,499
<i>under a near constant cover
of clouds and rain,</i>

20
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:19,966
<i>there's a small town named Forks.</i>

21
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:24,199
<i>Population, 3,120 people.</i>

22
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:27,699
<i>This is where I'm moving.</i>

23
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:31,574
<i>My dad's Charlie.</i>

24
00:02:32,314 --> 00:02:34,509
<i>He's the chief of police.</i>

25
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:39,082
<i>Curse the powers that be</i>

26
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:43,923
<i>Cause all I want is...</i>

27
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:45,790
Your hair's longer.

28
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:51,197
I cut it since the last time I saw you.

29
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:55,768
Guess it grew out again.

30
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,807
<i>I used to spend two weeks here
almost every summer,</i>

31
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:10,384
<i>but it's been years.</i>

32
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:27,299
I've cleared some shelves off
in the bathroom.

33
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:29,597
Right. One bathroom.

34
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:38,076
It's a pretty good work lamp.

35
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:41,949
The sales lady picked out the bed stuff.

36
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:44,542
You like purple, right?

37
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,212
Purple's cool.

38
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,354
Thanks.

39
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:55,959
Okay.

40
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:04,029
<i>One of the best things about Charlie,</i>

41
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:06,006
<i>he doesn't hover.</i>

42
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:15,347
Heard you guys coming
all the way down the road.

43
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,009
Good to see you.

44
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:21,654
Bella, you remember Billy Black.

45
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:25,023
- Wow, you're looking good.
- Well, I'm still dancing.

46
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:26,955
I'm glad you're finally here.

47
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:29,327
Charlie here hasn't shut up about it
since you told him you were coming.

48
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:33,400
All right, keep exaggerating.
I'll roll you into the mud.

49
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:35,300
After I ram you in the ankles.

50
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:36,963
You want to go?

51
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,267
Bring it.

52
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,275
- Hi, I'm Jacob.
- Hey.

53
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,107
We used to make mud pies
when we were little.

54
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:46,010
Right. No, I remember.

55
00:04:47,182 --> 00:04:49,241
Are they always like this?

56
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:52,719
- It's getting worse with old age.
- Good.

57
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:54,517
So, what do you think?

58
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,686
Of what?

59
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,660
- Your homecoming present.
- This?

60
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:03,029
- Just bought it off Billy here.
- Yep.

61
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:06,124
- I totally rebuilt the engine for you.
- Come on.

62
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,964
Oh, my gosh!

63
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:10,405
This is perfect. Are you joking me?

64
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,206
Sorry.

65
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:16,143
I told you she'd love it.

66
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:18,111
I'm down with the kids.

67
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,671
Oh, yeah, dude. You're the bomb.

68
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:22,080
Okay.

69
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,845
Listen, you gotta double-pump
the clutch when you shift,

70
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,081
but besides that, you should be good.

71
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:29,386
- That's this one?
- Yeah, right there.

72
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,982
All right.

73
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:33,785
Do you want a ride to school or something?

74
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:35,887
I go to school on the reservation.

75
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:38,325
Right, right.

76
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,563
That's too bad.
It would've been nice to know one person.

77
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:50,034
<i>My first day at a new school.</i>

78
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:52,444
<i>It's March, middle of the semester.</i>

79
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:54,910
<i>Great.</i>

80
00:06:01,724 --> 00:06:04,284
- Nice ride.
- Thanks.

81
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:07,158
Good one.

82
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:15,927
You're Isabella Swan, the new girl.

83
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,372
Hi, I'm Eric, the eyes and ears of this place.

84
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,277
Anything you need, tour guide,
lunch date, shoulder to cry on?

85
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,786
I'm really kind of the more
suffer-in-silence type.

86
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:33,779
Good headline for your feature.

87
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:36,518
I'm on the paper,
and you're news, baby, front page.

88
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:38,025
No, I'm not.

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,194
You...
Please don't have any sort of...

90
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:44,459
Chillax. No feature.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,399
- Okay, thanks.
- Cool?

92
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,469
All right. Okay.

93
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,268
Get it! Get it! Get it!

94
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,203
To you!

95
00:06:58,781 --> 00:06:59,839
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:02,179
I told them not to let me play.

97
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:04,950
No way. No, no, no.
That's... That's... Don't...

98
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,454
You're Isabella, right?

99
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:08,990
Just Bella.

100
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:11,219
Hey, I'm Mike Newton.

101
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:13,654
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, yeah.

102
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,993
- She's got a great spike, huh?
- Yeah, it's...

103
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:17,794
I'm Jessica, by the way.

104
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,800
Hey, you're from Arizona, right?

105
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,001
Aren't people from Arizona
supposed to be, like, really tan?

106
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,802
Maybe that's why they kicked me out.

107
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:33,781
You're good.

108
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:36,712
That's so funny.

109
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:42,149
- Back in, Jess.
- Down here.

110
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:44,253
Like a masterpiece, you know,

111
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:46,590
we'll have, like,
this crazy pyramid fall from the sky,

112
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:48,596
- and then you guys can...
- It's my pleasure, Madame.

113
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:50,791
- You guys can give each other high fives.
- Burrito, my friend?

114
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,494
- Hey, Mikey! You met my home girl, Bella?
- Hey.

115
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:54,896
Your home girl?

116
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:57,869
- That's...
- My girl.

117
00:07:58,273 --> 00:07:59,740
Sorry I had to mess up your game, Mike!

118
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:00,797
Tyler.

119
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:03,205
Yes!

120
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,269
Oh, my God.

121
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:09,408
It's like first grade all over again.
You're the shiny new toy.

122
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,082
Smile.

123
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:12,715
- Okay.
- Sorry.

124
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:14,187
I needed a candid for the feature.

125
00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:15,655
The feature's dead, Angela.

126
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:17,783
Don't bring it up again.

127
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,185
It's okay, I just...

128
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:21,525
I got your back, baby.

129
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:24,794
Guess we'll just run another editorial
on teen drinking.

130
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:29,031
You know,
you can always go for eating disorders.

131
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:32,506
Speedo padding on the swim team.

132
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,132
Actually, that's a good one.

133
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,303
Kirk. Right? That's exactly what I thought.

134
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:39,540
We're talking Olympic-size.

135
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:41,708
There's no way. He's so skinny.
It doesn't make sense.

136
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:43,445
Totally.

137
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,478
Who are they?

138
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,648
The Cullens.

139
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,251
They're Dr. and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids.

140
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,856
They moved down here from Alaska,
like, a few years ago.

141
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,060
They kind of keep to themselves.

142
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,069
Yeah, 'cause they're all together.

143
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,162
Like, together, together.

144
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:09,402
The blonde girl, that's Rosalie,

145
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:13,073
and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett,
they're, like, a thing.

146
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:14,615
I'm not even sure that's legal.

147
00:09:14,683 --> 00:09:17,049
Jess, they're not actually related.

148
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,781
Yeah, but they live together. It's weird.

149
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:23,484
And, okay, the little dark-haired girl's Alice.

150
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,459
She's really weird,

151
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:29,691
and she's with Jasper, the blond one
who looks like he's in pain.

152
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,468
Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad/matchmaker.

153
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,531
Maybe he'll adopt me.

154
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:43,144
Who's he?

155
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:51,215
That's Edward Cullen.

156
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:54,084
He's totally gorgeous, obviously,

157
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:57,489
but apparently nobody here's
good enough for him.

158
00:09:58,427 --> 00:10:00,793
Like I care, you know?

159
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:02,728
So, yeah.

160
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,233
Seriously, like,
don't waste your time.

161
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,430
I wasn't planning on it.

162
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:22,450
- Mr. Molina.
- Hey, Mike.

163
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,883
Oh, yes. Miss Swan.

164
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,801
Hi. Can I have the pass? Thank you.

165
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:45,203
Welcome to the class.
Here. Here's your stuff, okay?

166
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,936
And I got a seat for you right here,
so come over.

167
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,342
The last one.
Just follow along till you catch up.

168
00:10:50,412 --> 00:10:54,508
All right, guys, today we are gonna be
observing the behavior of planaria,

169
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,642
aka flatworms.

170
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:59,647
So what we're gonna do...

171
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:05,383
...regenerate.

172
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:07,451
Zombie worms.

173
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:12,026
No cell phones. Guys, let's get to it.

174
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,864
Gentle, gentle, certain areas.

175
00:11:14,937 --> 00:11:18,703
Please just don't cut here.
We don't cut here.

176
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:20,742
You won't believe this.

177
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:24,838
Let's try to focus
while we check those out, huh, guys?

178
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,122
There must be something open.

179
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:40,127
- Physics? Biochem?
- No, every class is full.

180
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,554
Just a minute, dear.

181
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in biology.

182
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:50,171
Fine. Just... I'll just have to endure it.

183
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:10,021
I just can't get over how grown up you are.
And so gorgeous.

184
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:12,617
Hey, Bella.

185
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:14,355
You remember me?

186
00:12:15,564 --> 00:12:17,691
I played Santa one year.

187
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:20,929
Yeah, Waylon, she hasn't had
a Christmas here since she was four.

188
00:12:21,003 --> 00:12:23,130
I bet I made an impression, though, didn't I?

189
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,730
- You always do.
- Butt-crack Santa?

190
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:28,299
Hey, kids love those little bottles, though.

191
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:31,608
All right,
let the girl eat her garden burger, Waylon.

192
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,114
As soon as you're done,
I will bring you your favorite.

193
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:36,013
Berry cobbler, remember?

194
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:39,019
Your dad still has it. Every Thursday.

195
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,214
Thank you. That'd be great.

196
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:47,259
Here.

197
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:48,957
Thanks.

198
00:12:57,906 --> 00:13:00,670
<i>Hey, baby. So, listen,
if spring training goes well,</i>

199
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:01,902
<i>we could be moving to Florida.</i>

200
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:05,071
<i>Please insert $1.25
for an additional three minutes.</i>

201
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:06,341
Mom, where's your cell?

202
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,882
Okay, don't laugh.

203
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:10,440
I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away.

204
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,851
Screaming. I literally repel technology now.

205
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:19,015
- I miss you.
- Oh, baby, I miss you, too.

206
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:21,392
But tell me more about your school.
Now, what are the kids like?

207
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,522
<i>Are there any cute guys?</i>

208
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,429
<i>Are they being nice to you?</i>

209
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:27,930
Well,

210
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:31,432
they're all very welcoming.

211
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:33,674
Tell me all about it.

212
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:35,437
It doesn't even matter.

213
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,704
<i>Yes, it does, honey.</i>

214
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:39,906
I have homework to do. I'll talk to you later.

215
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:42,348
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

216
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,009
Love you, too.

217
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:57,460
<i>I planned to confront him
and demand to know what his problem was.</i>

218
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:08,340
<i>But he never showed.</i>

219
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:15,878
Bella!

220
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:33,034
<i>And the next day, another no-show.</i>

221
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:39,803
<i>More days passed.</i>

222
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,006
<i>Things were getting a little strange.</i>

223
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,319
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

224
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:37,229
Ice doesn't really help the uncoordinated.

225
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:40,962
That's why I had
some new tires put on the truck.

226
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:43,800
Old ones were getting pretty bald.

227
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:46,864
Well, probably be late for dinner.
I gotta head down to Mason County.

228
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:51,208
Security guard at the Grisham Mill
got killed by some kind of animal.

229
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:53,380
An animal?

230
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:57,277
You're not in Phoenix anymore, Bells.

231
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:59,445
Anyway, I figured I'd lend a hand.

232
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,785
- Be careful.
- Always am.

233
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,782
And thanks for the tires.

234
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:23,910
Prom Committee is a chick thing,

235
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:25,879
but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway,

236
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:27,710
and they need a guy
to help choose the music,

237
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:28,806
so I need your play list.

238
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:33,411
Hey, listen, I was wondering,
did you have a date to...

239
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:35,217
What's up, Arizona? Huh?

240
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,224
How you liking the rain, girl?

241
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,384
Better get used to it, girl.

242
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,223
Yeah, Mike, hey, you're real cute, man.

243
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:43,458
- Oh, I know...
- That was really awesome.

244
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:45,829
Why you shooting down my game?
Let a playa play.

245
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,630
Yeah, okay.
What you playing at, T-Ball?

246
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,742
Hello.

247
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:04,509
I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance
to introduce myself last week.

248
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:06,520
I'm Edward Cullen.

249
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:08,078
You're Bella?

250
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,282
Yes.

251
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:12,087
Onion root tip cells,

252
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,889
that's what's on your slides right now.

253
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:18,160
Okay? So, separate and label them
into the phases of mitosis,

254
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:23,193
and the first partners that get it right
are gonna win the Golden Onion.

255
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,902
All right, good.

256
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:30,601
Ladies first.

257
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,141
You were gone.

258
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:41,678
I was out of town for a couple of days.

259
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:43,553
Personal reasons.

260
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:46,084
Prophase.

261
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:49,230
Do you mind if I look?

262
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:55,961
It's prophase.

263
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:58,361
Like I said.

264
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:06,276
So are you enjoying the rain?

265
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:10,414
What?

266
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:12,783
You're asking me about the weather?

267
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:14,219
Yeah, I...

268
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:16,380
I guess I am.

269
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,695
Well, I don't really like the rain.

270
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:27,089
Any cold, wet thing, I don't really...

271
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:33,866
- What?
- Nothing.

272
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,644
It's anaphase.

273
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:43,447
- You mind if I check?
- Sure.

274
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,322
Anaphase.

275
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:55,487
Like I said.

276
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,398
If you hate the cold and the rain so much,

277
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:05,565
why'd you move to the wettest place
in the continental US?

278
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,076
It's complicated.

279
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:15,706
I'm sure I can keep up.

280
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:22,382
My mom remarried, and...

281
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:26,623
So you don't like the guy, or...

282
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:28,891
No, that's not...

283
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:33,363
Phil's really nice.

284
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:49,145
It's metaphase. You want to check it?

285
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:52,144
I believe you.

286
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:56,115
Why didn't you move
with your mother and Phil?

287
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:01,928
Well, Phil's a minor league baseball player,

288
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:04,897
and he travels a lot,

289
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:08,367
and my mom stayed home with me,
but I knew it made her unhappy,

290
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:12,930
so I figured I'd stay with my dad for a while.

291
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,036
And now you're unhappy.

292
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,840
- No.
- I'm sorry, I'm just...

293
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:23,646
I'm just trying to figure you out.

294
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:26,152
You're very difficult for me to read.

295
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,451
Hey, did you get contacts?

296
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:29,854
No.

297
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:33,156
Your eyes were black
the last time I saw you,

298
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:37,187
and now they're, like, golden brown.

299
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:39,426
Yeah, I know, it's the...

300
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,859
It's the fluorescents.

301
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:38,885
- Bella!
- Bella!

302
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:41,083
Dial 911!

303
00:21:41,162 --> 00:21:43,130
I already called.
They're gonna send somebody over soon.

304
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:45,722
Bella, I'm so sorry. I panicked.

305
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,632
Bella, I've got 911 on the phone now.

306
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:57,708
Bella. You okay?

307
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:00,045
You and I are gonna talk. You all right?

308
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:01,911
I'm fine, Dad. Calm down.

309
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:04,417
I'm sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.

310
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:05,543
I know. It's okay.

311
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,054
No. It sure as hell is not okay.

312
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:09,549
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

313
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,683
You could've been killed.
You understand that?

314
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,920
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

315
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:17,692
You can kiss your license goodbye.

316
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:20,393
- I heard the chief's daughter was here.
- Dr. Cullen.

317
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:21,833
Charlie.

318
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:24,296
I've got this one, Jackie.

319
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:26,703
Isabella.

320
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:28,497
Bella.

321
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,845
Well, Bella, looks like you took quite a spill.
How do you feel?

322
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:33,073
Good.

323
00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:35,213
Look here.

324
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:40,244
You might experience some
post-traumatic stress or disorientation,

325
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:42,221
but your vitals look good.

326
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,383
No signs of any head trauma.

327
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:45,983
I think you'll be just fine.

328
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,528
I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really...

329
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:52,891
You know,
it would've been a whole lot worse

330
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:55,834
if Edward wasn't there.
He knocked me out of the way.

331
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:57,996
Edward? Your boy?

332
00:22:58,606 --> 00:22:59,971
Yeah, it was amazing.

333
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,805
I mean, he got to me so fast.
He was nowhere near me.

334
00:23:02,877 --> 00:23:04,970
Sounds like you were very lucky.

335
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:06,343
Charlie.

336
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:13,581
I gotta go sign some paperwork.
You should...

337
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:16,722
You should probably call your mom.

338
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,418
Did you tell her?

339
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:23,162
She's probably just

340
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:25,959
freaking out.

341
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:28,600
fifteen kids that saw
what happened.

342
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,230
What was I supposed to do, then?
Let her die?

343
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:34,001
This isn't just about you. It's about all of us.

344
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:36,873
I think we should
take this in my office.

345
00:23:38,913 --> 00:23:41,882
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Rosalie.

346
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,354
What?

347
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:55,093
How did you get over to me so fast?

348
00:23:55,163 --> 00:23:57,631
I was standing right next to you, Bella.

349
00:23:57,699 --> 00:24:01,499
No. You were next to your car,
across the lot.

350
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:03,695
No, I wasn't.

351
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,869
Yes, you were.

352
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,777
Bella, you're... You hit your head.

353
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:14,610
I think you're confused.

354
00:24:14,682 --> 00:24:16,115
I know what I saw.

355
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:18,311
And what exactly was that?

356
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:20,518
You...

357
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:24,190
You stopped the van.

358
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,455
You pushed it away with your hand.

359
00:24:28,396 --> 00:24:31,126
Well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...

360
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,595
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

361
00:24:35,303 --> 00:24:37,703
I just need to know the truth.

362
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,538
Can't you just thank me and get over it?

363
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:43,467
Thank you.

364
00:24:44,912 --> 00:24:47,642
- You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- No.

365
00:24:47,715 --> 00:24:50,684
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.

366
00:25:25,286 --> 00:25:28,778
<i>And that was the first night
I dreamt of Edward Cullen.</i>

367
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:32,852
I need everybody's permission slips, okay?

368
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:34,656
Sammy, please collect them.

369
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:36,458
Guys, let's go.

370
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:39,466
Come on, get in. In. Let's go!

371
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,309
Look at you, huh? You're alive.

372
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,942
I know, yeah. False alarm, I guess.

373
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:01,786
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,

374
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,551
it's like a month away, but...

375
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:08,689
Do you wanna go to prom with me?

376
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:13,826
So, what do you think?

377
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:16,836
- About what?
- Do you want to go?

378
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,273
To prom?

379
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:22,002
With me?

380
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:24,942
I...

381
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,776
Prom.

382
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:29,014
Dancing.

383
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,779
Not such a good idea for me.

384
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:35,853
I have something that weekend anyway.

385
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:37,857
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.

386
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:39,893
You can't go another weekend?

387
00:26:39,961 --> 00:26:41,861
Non-refundable ticket.

388
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:44,722
You should ask Jessica.

389
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,767
I know she wants to go with you.

390
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,597
All right. All right.

391
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:52,238
Yo, yo, yo. Hey, guys, come on.

392
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:55,434
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Green is what? Good.

393
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:57,875
Let's go. Guys, come on.

394
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:01,108
Other bus, other bus. Let's go.

395
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:02,740
<i>Egg shells, carrot tops.</i>

396
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:05,445
Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that in there, Eric.

397
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,009
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Very good, very good.

398
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:12,458
Now, I am gonna make a steaming cup
of compost tea.

399
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:13,885
- Okay.
- Give me that.

400
00:27:13,961 --> 00:27:17,863
This is recycling
in its most basic form, guys.

401
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:20,560
Don't drink it! It's for the plants.

402
00:27:21,235 --> 00:27:23,362
What's in Jacksonville?

403
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,434
How did you know about that?

404
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,772
You didn't answer my question.

405
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:33,776
You don't answer any of mine, so...

406
00:27:33,848 --> 00:27:36,476
I mean, you don't even say hi to me.

407
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:38,112
Hi.

408
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:42,381
Are you gonna tell me
how you stopped the van?

409
00:27:42,456 --> 00:27:45,357
I had an adrenaline rush.

410
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:48,487
It's very common. You can Google it.

411
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:54,128
Floridians.

412
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:56,499
That's what's in Jacksonville.

413
00:27:57,071 --> 00:27:59,835
Can you at least watch where you walk?

414
00:28:02,843 --> 00:28:06,609
Look, I'm sorry I'm being rude all the time.
I just think it's the best way.

415
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:09,445
Bella! Guess who just asked me to prom.

416
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:11,213
Who?

417
00:28:11,752 --> 00:28:16,746
Yeah, I actually totally thought
that Mike was gonna ask you.

418
00:28:16,824 --> 00:28:19,987
- It's not gonna be weird, though, right?
- No. Zero weirdness.

419
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:21,926
- You guys are great together.
- I know, right?

420
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:24,964
- Tyler...
- Gross.

421
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:27,125
Bella, look. It's a worm.

422
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:28,691
It's a worm.

423
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:35,107
Bella, we shouldn't be friends.

424
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:41,407
You really should've figured
that out a little earlier.

425
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:43,541
I mean, why didn't you just
let the van crush me

426
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:46,085
and save yourself all this regret?

427
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:50,020
What, you think I regret saving you?

428
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:53,549
I can see that you do.
I just... I don't know why.

429
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:56,655
You don't know anything.

430
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:58,562
Hi.

431
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,093
Are you gonna be riding with us?

432
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,998
No, our bus is full.

433
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,170
Your mom called. Again.

434
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,139
Well, that's your fault.

435
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:19,846
You shouldn't have told her
about the "almost" accident. You finished?

436
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:25,916
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
She always did know how to worry.

437
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:29,193
She seems different.

438
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:31,724
She seems happy.

439
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:37,593
Phil sounds like an all right guy.

440
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:40,663
Yeah, he is.

441
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:48,447
All right.

442
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:51,277
No, you need the mitts.
You need them.

443
00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:54,252
No, why do you keep arguing with me?
You just need them.

444
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:57,415
- You're gonna get frostbite!
- I don't even know.

445
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:02,219
Hey!

446
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:05,060
- La Push, baby. You in?
- Should I know what that means?

447
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:07,657
La Push Beach down at the Quileute Rez.
We're all going tomorrow.

448
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:10,932
- Yeah, there's a big swell coming in.
- And I don't just surf the Internet.

449
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:13,269
Eric, you stood up once,
and it was a foam board.

450
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,706
But there's whale watching, too.
Come with us.

451
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:18,836
La Push, baby. It's La Push.

452
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:21,304
Okay, I'll go if you stop saying that, okay?

453
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:22,940
Seriously, dude. It's creepy, man.

454
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:24,279
- What? That's what it's called.
- So...

455
00:30:24,485 --> 00:30:25,952
Edible art?

456
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:30,553
Bella.

457
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:33,090
Thanks.

458
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,960
You know, your mood swings
are kind of giving me whiplash.

459
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:40,124
I only said it'd be better
if we weren't friends,

460
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:41,634
not that I didn't wanna be.

461
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:43,533
What does that mean?

462
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:47,472
It means if you were smart,
you'd stay away from me.

463
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:51,639
Okay, well, let's say for argument's sake
that I'm not smart.

464
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:54,909
- Would you tell me the truth?
- No, probably not.

465
00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:58,382
I'd rather hear your theories.

466
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,611
I have considered

467
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:05,690
radioactive spiders and Kryptonite.

468
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:09,827
That's all superhero stuff, right?

469
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:13,298
What if I'm not the hero?
What if I'm the bad guy?

470
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:15,558
You're not.

471
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:18,371
I can see what you're trying to put off,

472
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:20,737
but I can see that it's just
to keep people away from you.

473
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:22,366
It's a mask.

474
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,077
Why don't we just hang out?

475
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,016
Everybody's going to the beach.

476
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:35,487
Come.

477
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,148
I mean, have fun.

478
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:45,022
- Which beach?
- La Push.

479
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,664
I don't know.

480
00:31:47,735 --> 00:31:49,066
I just...

481
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:52,438
Is there something wrong with that beach?

482
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,068
It's just a little crowded.

483
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:05,511
- Hey, it's freezing.
- I'm paddling out, Coates.

484
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:08,413
- I don't know if it's worth it anymore.
- We drove all the way out here.

485
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:10,320
I'm at least paddling out.

486
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:11,915
- She's right.
- You guys are babies.

487
00:32:11,992 --> 00:32:15,587
So, I keep thinking that Eric's
gonna ask me to the prom,

488
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:18,154
and then he just doesn't.

489
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:22,769
You should ask him.

490
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,968
Take control.
You're a strong, independent woman.

491
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:29,370
- I am?
- Yes.

492
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:33,109
Hey, will you do me up?

493
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:36,943
- Bella!
- Hi, Jacob.

494
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:38,609
- Guys, this is Jacob.
- Hey, guys. How you doing?

495
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,085
- Hi.
- Hi.

496
00:32:41,956 --> 00:32:43,981
What are you, like, stalking me?

497
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,151
You're on my rez, remember?

498
00:32:47,027 --> 00:32:48,619
Are you surfing?

499
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:50,894
- Definitely not.
- Thanks.

500
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:53,866
You guys should keep Bella company.
Her date bailed.

501
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:54,992
What date?

502
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:56,900
She invited Edward.

503
00:32:56,971 --> 00:32:59,496
- To be polite, that's it.
- I think it's nice she invited him.

504
00:32:59,573 --> 00:33:02,098
- Nobody ever does.
- Yeah, 'cause Cullen's a freak.

505
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:04,076
You got that right.

506
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:06,239
You guys know him?

507
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:08,577
The Cullens don't come here.

508
00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:21,423
What did your friends mean about,
you know, "The Cullens don't come here?"

509
00:33:21,495 --> 00:33:23,520
You caught that, huh?

510
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:28,097
I'm not really supposed
to say anything about it.

511
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:30,995
Hey, I can keep a secret.

512
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,009
Really, it's just like an old scary story.

513
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:40,504
Well, I want to know.

514
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,650
Okay, did you know Quileutes
are supposedly descended from wolves?

515
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:50,955
What? Like, wolves?

516
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,993
Like, real wolves?

517
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,427
<i>Well, that's the legend of our tribe.</i>

518
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,654
<i>Okay.</i>

519
00:33:57,731 --> 00:34:00,495
So what's the story about the Cullens?

520
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:06,498
Well, they're supposedly descended
from this, like, enemy clan.

521
00:34:09,777 --> 00:34:13,804
<i>My great grandfather, the chief,
found them hunting on our land.</i>

522
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,806
But they claimed to be something different,

523
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:19,148
<i>so we made a treaty with them.</i>

524
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:22,247
If they promised to stay off Quileute lands,

525
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:26,453
then we wouldn't expose
what they really were to the palefaces.

526
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:30,352
I thought they just moved here.

527
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:32,832
Or just moved back.

528
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,862
Right.

529
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:38,232
It touched my hand.
A snake! Stop!

530
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:42,573
Well, what are they really?

531
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:44,736
It's just a story, Bella.

532
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:47,610
Come on, let's go.

533
00:34:50,884 --> 00:34:53,409
A snake! A snake!

534
00:34:57,524 --> 00:35:03,622
<i>My mama said I didn't know
how to make a kitty meow</i>

535
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:12,135
Hello?

536
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:20,341
Gerald?

537
00:35:21,615 --> 00:35:22,877
Gerald?

538
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:43,597
Hello.

539
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:45,995
Nice jacket.

540
00:35:49,076 --> 00:35:50,202
Who are you?

541
00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:53,178
It's always the same inane questions.

542
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:54,441
"Who are you?"

543
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:56,278
"What do you want?"

544
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:58,876
"Why are you doing this?"

545
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:02,615
James, let's not play with our food.

546
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,631
He's not here.

547
00:36:55,843 --> 00:36:59,108
Whenever the weather's nice,
the Cullens disappear.

548
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,375
What, do they just ditch?

549
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:06,147
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank them out
for, like, hiking and camping and stuff.

550
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,415
I tried that out on my parents.
Not even close.

551
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:11,287
Guys, I'm going to the prom with Eric.

552
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,055
- I just asked him. I took control.
- I told you that would happen.

553
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:17,596
Are you sure you have to go out of town?

554
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:20,224
Oh, yeah, it's a little family thing.

555
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,665
Okay, we should go shopping
in Port Angeles

556
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:24,670
before all the good dresses get cleaned out.

557
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:30,375
Port Angeles? You mind if I come?

558
00:37:30,444 --> 00:37:32,776
Yeah, I need your opinion.

559
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:36,040
- I like this one.
- That's cool.

560
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:38,448
But, like, I don't know about
the one-shoulder thing.

561
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,986
- I like this one.
- Yeah, I like the beading,

562
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:42,351
- and you wouldn't need jewelry.
- Jess, what do you think? Lavender?

563
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:44,322
- Is that good? Is that my color?
- I like it.

564
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:46,382
I liked that dusty rose one, too.

565
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,429
Okay, I like this one.
It makes my boobs look good.

566
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:50,656
- Hey.
- Right?

567
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:51,925
Nice.

568
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:55,262
- Oh, God.
- That is uncomfortable.

569
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:57,298
That's disgusting.

570
00:37:57,538 --> 00:37:59,369
Bella, what do you think?

571
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:00,667
Yes?

572
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:02,871
That looks great.

573
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:05,912
You said that about, like,
the last five dresses, though.

574
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:08,209
I thought they were all pretty good.

575
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:10,807
You're not really into this, are you?

576
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:14,183
I actually really just want
to go to this bookstore.

577
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:16,045
I'll meet you guys at the restaurant?

578
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:18,853
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll see you in a minute.

579
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,484
- Okay.
- Okay.

580
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:24,188
She's right, though. This looks awesome.

581
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:29,128
There you go.

582
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:32,901
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

583
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:08,771
- Saw you in the dress store.
- Hey, where you running to?

584
00:39:08,842 --> 00:39:10,002
There she is.

585
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:11,942
- What's up?
- It's my girl.

586
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:13,673
- How you guys doing?
- Look who we just found.

587
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:16,614
What's up, girl? Hey... Where you going?

588
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:18,742
- Where are you going?
- Come get a drink with us.

589
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:20,150
- Yeah, you should hang out with us.
- Come on.

590
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,551
It's fun.

591
00:39:21,622 --> 00:39:23,021
- What's the problem?
- She doesn't like that, man.

592
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,489
- You're pretty.
- Don't touch me.

593
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:26,458
- Cute.
- Really, no. Seriously, you should.

594
00:39:26,526 --> 00:39:28,084
Don't touch me.

595
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:37,595
Get in the car.

596
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,901
That was a very dangerous maneuver.

597
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:11,329
I should go back there
and rip those guys' heads off.

598
00:40:11,405 --> 00:40:12,429
No, you shouldn't.

599
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:15,373
You don't know the vile, repulsive things
they were thinking.

600
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:16,875
And you do?

601
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:19,636
It's not hard to guess.

602
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:25,183
Can you talk about something else?
Distract me so I won't turn around.

603
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:28,785
You should put your seatbelt on.

604
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:32,523
You should put your seatbelt on.

605
00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:40,124
- I thought the salad was pretty good.
- Hey, you guys, I'm sorry. I just...

606
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,724
Where were you? We left you messages.

607
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:45,238
Yeah, we waited, but we were, like,
starving, so we...

608
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,773
I'm sorry I kept Bella from dinner.

609
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:52,175
We just sort of ran into each other
and got talking.

610
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:54,841
No.

611
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:58,646
No, we totally understand.
I mean, that happens, right?

612
00:40:59,553 --> 00:41:00,611
Yeah, we were...

613
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:03,554
- We were, yeah, we were just leaving. So...
- Let's get this...

614
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:05,557
Bella, if you wanna...

615
00:41:05,926 --> 00:41:09,020
I think I should make sure
Bella gets something to eat.

616
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:10,620
If you'd like.

617
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,292
I'll drive you home myself.

618
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:16,733
That's so thoughtful.

619
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:19,271
It's really thoughtful.

620
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:22,067
I should eat something.

621
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:26,802
- Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, yeah.

622
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,711
- See ya.
- Okay.

623
00:41:39,593 --> 00:41:41,993
All right, one mushroom ravioli.

624
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:45,229
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

625
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,464
So are you sure there isn't anything
I can get for you?

626
00:41:48,535 --> 00:41:50,435
No. No, thank you.

627
00:41:51,238 --> 00:41:52,899
Let me know.

628
00:41:58,812 --> 00:42:00,973
You're really not gonna eat?

629
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,778
No, I'm on a special diet.

630
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,420
You gotta give me some answers.

631
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:13,058
Yes, no.

632
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:16,227
To get to the other side.

633
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,764
1.77245...

634
00:42:18,832 --> 00:42:21,164
I don't want to know
what the square root of pi is.

635
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:22,929
You knew that?

636
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:25,130
How did you know where I was?

637
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:26,467
I didn't.

638
00:42:26,873 --> 00:42:29,569
- All right.
- What?

639
00:42:29,643 --> 00:42:31,304
Don't leave. I...

640
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:37,275
Did you follow me?

641
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:40,249
I...

642
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,757
I feel very protective of you.

643
00:42:47,627 --> 00:42:48,958
So you followed me.

644
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:52,021
I was trying to keep a distance
unless you needed my help,

645
00:42:52,098 --> 00:42:56,330
and then I heard what those low-lifes
were thinking.

646
00:42:56,403 --> 00:42:57,734
Wait.

647
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:01,306
You say you heard what they were thinking?

648
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:06,040
So what, you...

649
00:43:07,147 --> 00:43:08,910
You read minds?

650
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:15,448
I can read every mind in this room.

651
00:43:16,556 --> 00:43:18,387
Apart from yours.

652
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:23,956
There's money, sex,

653
00:43:25,432 --> 00:43:26,899
money,

654
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:29,091
sex,

655
00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:30,431
cat.

656
00:43:33,406 --> 00:43:36,239
And then you, nothing.

657
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,204
It's very frustrating.

658
00:43:42,682 --> 00:43:45,082
Is there something wrong with me?

659
00:43:46,486 --> 00:43:48,681
See, I tell you I can read minds,

660
00:43:48,755 --> 00:43:51,815
and you think there's
something wrong with you.

661
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:00,958
What is it?

662
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:08,304
I don't have the strength
to stay away from you anymore.

663
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,277
Then don't.

664
00:44:32,065 --> 00:44:34,659
Okay, I think I'm warm enough now.

665
00:44:41,107 --> 00:44:43,132
Your hand is so cold.

666
00:44:55,155 --> 00:44:57,020
What is going on?

667
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:00,526
My dad's still here.

668
00:45:00,593 --> 00:45:02,584
Can you pull in?

669
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:07,433
That's my father's car on the end.

670
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:09,892
What is he doing here?

671
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,800
Carlisle, what's going on?

672
00:45:16,376 --> 00:45:19,777
Waylon Forge was found in a boat
out near his place.

673
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,208
- I just examined the body.
- He died?

674
00:45:24,718 --> 00:45:27,016
- How?
- Animal attack.

675
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:32,619
Was it the same one that
got that security guard down in Mason?

676
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:33,954
Most likely.

677
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:37,861
- Well, it's getting closer to town, then.
- Bella, you should go inside.

678
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:40,422
Waylon was your father's friend.

679
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,694
Okay.

680
00:45:45,372 --> 00:45:47,237
I'll see you later.

681
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:01,150
- Hey.
- Hey.

682
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:06,925
Dad, I'm really sorry.

683
00:46:11,498 --> 00:46:14,058
I've known him going on 30 years.

684
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:31,982
Don't worry, we're gonna find this thing.

685
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:34,652
Meantime,

686
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:38,356
I want you to carry this with you.

687
00:46:40,794 --> 00:46:44,958
- I don't know if you...
- It'll give your old man some peace of mind.

688
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:46,293
Okay.

689
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:51,230
Let's go home.

690
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,215
Cold One.

691
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:48,243
You're impossibly fast and strong.

692
00:49:49,582 --> 00:49:52,483
Your skin is pale white and ice-cold.

693
00:49:53,453 --> 00:49:55,387
Your eyes change color.

694
00:49:56,322 --> 00:50:00,622
And sometimes you speak
like you're from a different time.

695
00:50:02,262 --> 00:50:06,392
You never eat or drink anything.
You don't go out in the sunlight.

696
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:11,264
How old are you?

697
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,129
Seventeen.

698
00:50:16,376 --> 00:50:18,503
How long have you been 17?

699
00:50:21,981 --> 00:50:23,380
A while.

700
00:50:36,429 --> 00:50:38,294
I know what you are.

701
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,200
Say it.

702
00:50:45,705 --> 00:50:47,104
Out loud.

703
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:51,340
Say it.

704
00:50:57,283 --> 00:50:58,580
Vampire.

705
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:03,613
Are you afraid?

706
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:12,889
No.

707
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:18,470
Then ask me the most basic question.

708
00:51:18,538 --> 00:51:20,233
What do we eat?

709
00:51:23,176 --> 00:51:24,973
You won't hurt me.

710
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:31,747
Where are we going?

711
00:51:32,952 --> 00:51:34,112
Up the mountain.

712
00:51:34,187 --> 00:51:36,155
Out of the cloud bank.

713
00:51:36,222 --> 00:51:39,385
You need to see what
I look like in the sunlight.

714
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:01,071
This is why we don't show
ourselves in sunlight.

715
00:52:01,147 --> 00:52:03,615
People would know we're different.

716
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:15,556
This is what I am.

717
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,934
It's like diamonds.

718
00:52:31,511 --> 00:52:33,206
You're beautiful.

719
00:52:36,382 --> 00:52:37,940
Beautiful?

720
00:52:38,017 --> 00:52:40,645
This is the skin of a killer, Bella.

721
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,684
I'm a killer.

722
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:52,697
I don't believe that.

723
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:55,960
That's because you believe the lie.

724
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:58,196
It's camouflage.

725
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:03,373
I'm the world's most dangerous predator.

726
00:53:04,177 --> 00:53:07,340
Everything about me invites you in,

727
00:53:07,914 --> 00:53:11,247
my voice, my face, even my smell.

728
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:14,843
As if I would need any of that.

729
00:53:17,557 --> 00:53:19,718
As if you could outrun me!

730
00:53:25,465 --> 00:53:27,729
As if you could fight me off.

731
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,070
I'm designed to kill.

732
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:37,669
I don't care.

733
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:40,638
I've killed people before.

734
00:53:42,415 --> 00:53:44,212
It does not matter.

735
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:50,753
I wanted to kill you.

736
00:53:54,227 --> 00:53:58,664
I've never wanted a human's blood
so much in my life.

737
00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:01,456
I trust you.

738
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,267
Don't.

739
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:08,540
I'm here. I trust you.

740
00:54:13,112 --> 00:54:16,343
My family,
we're different from others of our kind.

741
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:18,178
We only hunt animals.

742
00:54:18,251 --> 00:54:20,879
We've learned to control our thirst.

743
00:54:21,587 --> 00:54:24,317
But it's you, your scent,

744
00:54:26,826 --> 00:54:29,056
it's like a drug to me.

745
00:54:30,463 --> 00:54:34,297
You're like
my own personal brand of heroin.

746
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,503
Why did you hate me
so much when we met?

747
00:54:44,577 --> 00:54:46,044
I did.

748
00:54:46,345 --> 00:54:49,075
Only for making me want you so badly.

749
00:54:49,682 --> 00:54:52,651
I still don't know if I can control myself.

750
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,281
I know you can.

751
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:06,756
I can't read your mind.

752
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:10,402
You have to tell me what you're thinking.

753
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:14,567
Now I'm afraid.

754
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:20,910
Good.

755
00:55:22,048 --> 00:55:23,982
I'm not afraid of you.

756
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,816
I'm only afraid of losing you.
I feel like you're gonna disappear.

757
00:55:38,931 --> 00:55:41,923
You don't know how long
I've waited for you.

758
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:52,975
So the lion fell in love with the lamb.

759
00:55:56,582 --> 00:55:58,413
What a stupid lamb.

760
00:55:58,484 --> 00:56:01,078
What a sick, masochistic lion.

761
00:57:26,672 --> 00:57:29,766
<i>About three things
I was absolutely positive.</i>

762
00:57:31,143 --> 00:57:32,303
<i>First,</i>

763
00:57:33,612 --> 00:57:35,443
<i>Edward was a vampire.</i>

764
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:41,281
<i>Second,</i>

765
00:57:42,088 --> 00:57:44,022
<i>there was a part of him,</i>

766
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,217
<i>and I didn't know
how dominant that part might be,</i>

767
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:49,922
<i>that thirsted for my blood.</i>

768
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:55,356
<i>And third,</i>

769
00:57:56,435 --> 00:58:00,235
<i>I was unconditionally and irrevocably
in love with him.</i>

770
00:58:05,878 --> 00:58:08,972
Monte Carlo?
That's our prom theme?

771
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:13,747
Gambling, tuxedos, and Bond, James Bond.

772
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,658
Oh, my God.

773
00:58:31,904 --> 00:58:34,236
You know, everybody's staring.

774
00:58:38,177 --> 00:58:41,544
Not that guy. No, he just looked.

775
00:58:43,983 --> 00:58:46,781
I'm breaking all the rules now anyway.

776
00:58:46,852 --> 00:58:48,979
Since I'm going to hell.

777
00:58:53,392 --> 00:58:56,190
So, does a person have to be dying

778
00:58:58,764 --> 00:59:00,664
to become like you?

779
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:04,202
No, that's just Carlisle.

780
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:09,229
He'd never do this to someone
who had another choice.

781
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,506
So, how long have you been like this?

782
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:16,004
Since 1918.

783
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:20,580
<i>That's when Carlisle found me
dying of Spanish influenza.</i>

784
00:59:22,721 --> 00:59:23,881
<i>What was it like?</i>

785
00:59:25,057 --> 00:59:27,423
<i>The venom was excruciating.</i>

786
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,288
<i>But what Carlisle did was much harder.</i>

787
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:32,830
<i>Not many of us have the restraint to do that.</i>

788
00:59:32,898 --> 00:59:35,560
But didn't he just have to bite?

789
00:59:37,803 --> 00:59:39,270
Not exactly.

790
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,602
When we taste

791
00:59:43,742 --> 00:59:47,178
human blood, a sort of frenzy begins,

792
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:51,172
and it's almost impossible to stop.

793
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:55,114
<i>But Carlisle did.</i>

794
00:59:55,187 --> 00:59:58,020
<i>First with me
and then with his wife, Esme.</i>

795
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:02,618
So is Carlisle the real reason
that you don't kill people?

796
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:08,562
No, he's not the only reason.

797
01:00:11,103 --> 01:00:13,799
I don't want to be a monster.

798
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:19,571
My family,
we think of ourselves as vegetarians, right,

799
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:22,978
'cause we only survive
on the blood of animals.

800
01:00:23,048 --> 01:00:24,515
But it's...

801
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:28,047
It's like a human only living on tofu.

802
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:32,648
It keeps you strong,
but you're never fully satisfied.

803
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:39,197
It wouldn't be like drinking your blood,
for instance.

804
01:00:44,603 --> 01:00:47,663
Was it other vampires that killed Waylon?

805
01:00:49,074 --> 01:00:53,340
There are others out there,
and we run into them from time to time.

806
01:00:55,314 --> 01:00:59,250
Can the rest of your family
read people's minds like you can?

807
01:01:02,321 --> 01:01:04,186
No. That's just me.

808
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:07,790
But Alice can see the future.

809
01:01:08,827 --> 01:01:10,818
I bet she saw me coming.

810
01:01:12,164 --> 01:01:14,598
Alice's visions are subjective.

811
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:17,832
I mean, the future can always change.

812
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,010
Could you act human?
I mean, I've got neighbors.

813
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,950
I'm gonna take you to my place tomorrow.

814
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:36,820
Thanks.

815
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:40,224
Wait, like, with your family?

816
01:01:41,527 --> 01:01:43,688
What if they don't like me?

817
01:01:44,563 --> 01:01:48,158
So, you're worried not because
you'll be in a house full of vampires,

818
01:01:48,233 --> 01:01:51,361
but because you think
they won't approve of you?

819
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,570
I'm glad I amuse you.

820
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,698
What is it?

821
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,602
Complication.

822
01:02:01,647 --> 01:02:03,740
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

823
01:02:29,475 --> 01:02:32,410
Hey. Come to visit your truck?

824
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:36,013
Looks good. Got that dent out.

825
01:02:36,081 --> 01:02:38,709
Actually, we came to visit your flat-screen.

826
01:02:38,784 --> 01:02:41,014
First Mariners game of the season.

827
01:02:41,086 --> 01:02:44,817
Plus Jacob here keeps bugging me about
seeing you again.

828
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,824
Great, Dad. Thanks.

829
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:49,087
Just keeping it real, son.

830
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:52,225
Vitamin R.

831
01:02:52,297 --> 01:02:54,026
Well done, Chief.

832
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:56,499
Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.

833
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:58,058
Good man.

834
01:03:00,439 --> 01:03:02,236
Any luck with that Waylon case?

835
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:05,105
Well, I don't think it was an animal
that killed him.

836
01:03:05,177 --> 01:03:07,236
Never thought it was.

837
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:10,476
So spread the word out at the rez, huh?

838
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:12,107
Keep the kids out of the woods.

839
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:13,481
Will do.

840
01:03:14,286 --> 01:03:17,255
Don't want no one else getting hurt, do we?

841
01:03:51,256 --> 01:03:53,019
This is incredible.

842
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:58,790
It's so light and open, you know?

843
01:04:00,432 --> 01:04:04,425
What did you expect,
coffins and dungeons and moats?

844
01:04:04,937 --> 01:04:07,337
No, not the moats.

845
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,967
Not the moats.

846
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:19,651
This is the one place we don't have to hide.

847
01:04:22,187 --> 01:04:24,018
I told them not to do this.

848
01:04:24,089 --> 01:04:27,752
<i>You add a little bit of olive oil
to a non-stick saut pan,</i>

849
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:31,227
<i>and you want to cook
with the olive oil in medium-high heat.</i>

850
01:04:31,296 --> 01:04:35,062
<i>What I do, I cut this in strips,
and then we gonna cut this...</i>

851
01:04:35,134 --> 01:04:38,262
- Is she even Italian?
- Her name is Bella.

852
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:41,306
I'm sure she'll love it, no matter what.

853
01:04:41,373 --> 01:04:43,170
Get a whiff of that.

854
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:45,869
Here comes the human.

855
01:04:49,748 --> 01:04:52,376
Bella, we're making Italiano for you.

856
01:04:53,552 --> 01:04:57,989
Bella, this is Esme.
My mother for all intents and purposes.

857
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:02,990
You've given us an excuse
to use the kitchen for the first time.

858
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:04,221
I hope you're hungry.

859
01:05:04,296 --> 01:05:06,924
- Yeah, absolutely.
- She already ate.

860
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:14,669
Perfect.

861
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,233
Yeah, it's just because
I know that you guys don't eat...

862
01:05:19,311 --> 01:05:21,802
Of course. It's very considerate of you.

863
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,440
Just ignore Rosalie. I do.

864
01:05:24,516 --> 01:05:27,679
Let's just keep pretending
like this isn't dangerous for all of us.

865
01:05:27,753 --> 01:05:31,314
I would never tell anybody anything.

866
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,753
She knows that.

867
01:05:33,825 --> 01:05:36,919
Yeah, well, the problem is,
you two have gone public now, so...

868
01:05:36,995 --> 01:05:37,984
Emmett.

869
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,758
No, she should know.

870
01:05:39,831 --> 01:05:43,528
The entire family
will be implicated if this ends badly.

871
01:05:44,036 --> 01:05:45,731
Badly, as in...

872
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:49,705
I would become the meal.

873
01:05:57,082 --> 01:05:58,481
Hi, Bella.

874
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:03,777
I'm Alice.

875
01:06:04,723 --> 01:06:06,020
- Hi.
- Hi.

876
01:06:07,893 --> 01:06:09,793
You do smell good.

877
01:06:09,861 --> 01:06:11,021
Alice, what are you...

878
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:14,554
It's okay.
Bella and I are gonna be great friends.

879
01:06:17,903 --> 01:06:20,371
Sorry,
Jasper's our newest vegetarian.

880
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:22,532
It's a little difficult for him.

881
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:24,508
It's a pleasure to meet you.

882
01:06:24,576 --> 01:06:27,374
It's okay, Jasper. You won't hurt her.

883
01:06:28,847 --> 01:06:32,476
All right, I'm gonna take you
on a tour of the rest of the house.

884
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:34,849
- Okay.
- Well, I'll see you soon.

885
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,148
Okay.

886
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:39,681
- Cute!
- I know.

887
01:06:40,259 --> 01:06:41,487
I think that went well.

888
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,960
Clean this up. Now.

889
01:06:44,029 --> 01:06:47,157
Was that as weird for you as it was for me?

890
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:49,029
I don't know.

891
01:06:54,706 --> 01:06:56,367
Graduation caps?

892
01:06:57,542 --> 01:07:00,375
It's a private joke.

893
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,214
We matriculate a lot.

894
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,650
That's kind of miserable.

895
01:07:06,718 --> 01:07:09,585
I mean, repeating high school
over and over.

896
01:07:09,655 --> 01:07:11,748
True, but the younger we start out
in a new place,

897
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:13,950
the longer we can stay there.

898
01:07:14,026 --> 01:07:15,550
Come on.

899
01:07:25,804 --> 01:07:27,704
Yeah, this is my room.

900
01:07:40,552 --> 01:07:41,917
No bed?

901
01:07:42,487 --> 01:07:44,045
No, I don't...

902
01:07:44,823 --> 01:07:46,381
I don't sleep.

903
01:07:47,225 --> 01:07:49,557
- Ever?
- No, not at all.

904
01:07:52,764 --> 01:07:54,061
Okay.

905
01:08:02,474 --> 01:08:04,772
Boy, you have so much music.

906
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:07,739
What are you listening to?

907
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:12,740
It's Debussy.

908
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,120
I don't know...

909
01:08:20,926 --> 01:08:23,224
Claire De Lune is great.

910
01:08:57,863 --> 01:09:00,559
- What?
- I can't dance.

911
01:09:09,941 --> 01:09:12,171
Well, I could always make you.

912
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,447
I'm not scared of you.

913
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:22,786
Well, you really shouldn't have said that.

914
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:30,026
You better hold on tight, spider monkey.

915
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:36,862
Do you trust me?

916
01:09:37,402 --> 01:09:38,960
In theory.

917
01:09:39,571 --> 01:09:41,505
Then close your eyes.

918
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:07,293
What?

919
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:10,294
This isn't real.

920
01:10:10,936 --> 01:10:13,530
This kind of stuff just doesn't exist.

921
01:10:13,605 --> 01:10:15,368
It does in my world.

922
01:11:45,297 --> 01:11:46,787
Hold up.

923
01:11:52,037 --> 01:11:53,527
It's human.

924
01:11:57,576 --> 01:12:00,477
Arizona. Yo, what's happening?

925
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:03,037
So you and Cullen, huh?

926
01:12:03,114 --> 01:12:05,582
That's... I don't like it.

927
01:12:06,384 --> 01:12:08,045
I mean, I don't know,

928
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:11,384
he just looks at you
like you're something to eat.

929
01:12:13,992 --> 01:12:16,517
Here's your veggie plate, Stephenie.

930
01:12:17,028 --> 01:12:19,622
Hey, sorry I'm late. Biology project.

931
01:12:20,765 --> 01:12:23,632
I ordered you the spinach salad.
I hope that's okay.

932
01:12:23,702 --> 01:12:25,727
You should order one for yourself next time.

933
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:27,829
Cut back on the steak.

934
01:12:28,173 --> 01:12:30,471
Hey, I'm as healthy as a horse.

935
01:12:31,443 --> 01:12:33,968
Say, Chief, boys want to know,

936
01:12:35,347 --> 01:12:38,748
did you find anything
down by Queets River today?

937
01:12:41,419 --> 01:12:43,887
Yeah, we found a bare human footprint,

938
01:12:43,955 --> 01:12:46,321
but it looks like whoever that is,
is headed east,

939
01:12:46,391 --> 01:12:49,155
so Kitsap County sheriff is gonna take
over from here.

940
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:50,888
- Okay.
- Okay?

941
01:12:50,962 --> 01:12:53,328
I just hope they catch him fast.

942
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:05,474
Looks like your friends are flagging you.

943
01:13:07,278 --> 01:13:09,007
It's okay if you wanna go join them.

944
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,742
I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.

945
01:13:11,816 --> 01:13:13,181
Me, too.

946
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:15,742
Bella, it's Friday night. Go out.

947
01:13:16,755 --> 01:13:19,223
Looks like the Newton boy's
got a big smile for you.

948
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,349
Yeah, he's a good buddy.

949
01:13:22,227 --> 01:13:24,525
What about any of these
other yahoos in town?

950
01:13:24,596 --> 01:13:26,621
Anybody interest you?

951
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:30,397
Dad, we gonna talk about boys?

952
01:13:31,736 --> 01:13:33,397
Yeah, I guess not.

953
01:13:34,139 --> 01:13:37,575
I just feel like I leave you alone too much.

954
01:13:37,842 --> 01:13:40,037
You should be around people.

955
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:43,645
I don't really mind being alone.

956
01:13:44,249 --> 01:13:47,309
I guess I'm kind of like my dad in that way.

957
01:13:51,756 --> 01:13:54,452
So, how's all the baseball stuff going?

958
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:57,091
Phil's working so hard.

959
01:13:57,162 --> 01:13:59,630
You know, spring training.

960
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:02,667
We're looking for a house to rent
in case things become more permanent.

961
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:04,065
<i>You'd like Jacksonville, baby.</i>

962
01:14:05,704 --> 01:14:07,672
I'm really liking Forks.

963
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:08,933
What?

964
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:12,506
Forks is growing on me.

965
01:14:12,577 --> 01:14:15,444
Could a guy have anything to do with that?

966
01:14:15,513 --> 01:14:17,640
Well, yeah.

967
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:21,750
I knew it. Tell me everything.
What is he? Jock? Indie?

968
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:24,118
<i>I bet he's smart. Is he smart?</i>

969
01:14:26,191 --> 01:14:28,489
Mom, can I talk to you later?

970
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,688
Come on, we gotta talk boys.
Are you being safe?

971
01:14:37,001 --> 01:14:39,265
How did you get in here?

972
01:14:39,337 --> 01:14:40,861
The window.

973
01:14:41,339 --> 01:14:43,204
Do you do that a lot?

974
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:46,871
Well, just the past couple of months.

975
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,943
I like watching you sleep.

976
01:14:55,553 --> 01:14:58,078
It's kind of fascinating to me.

977
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,958
I always want to try one thing.

978
01:15:06,231 --> 01:15:08,062
Just stay very still.

979
01:15:15,173 --> 01:15:16,663
Don't move.

980
01:16:00,618 --> 01:16:02,279
Stop it!

981
01:16:04,656 --> 01:16:06,146
I'm sorry.

982
01:16:08,993 --> 01:16:11,154
I'm stronger than I thought.

983
01:16:11,763 --> 01:16:14,254
I wish I could say the same.

984
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:21,630
I can't ever lose control with you.

985
01:16:27,946 --> 01:16:29,607
Hey, don't go.

986
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:19,956
- Hey, got you another one.
- Thanks.

987
01:17:20,031 --> 01:17:22,499
I have a date with Edward Cullen.

988
01:17:24,736 --> 01:17:27,261
He's a little old for you, isn't he?

989
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:28,831
No.

990
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,670
He's a junior. I'm a junior.

991
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:34,776
I thought you liked the Cullens.

992
01:17:35,113 --> 01:17:37,775
I thought you didn't like
any of the boys in town.

993
01:17:37,849 --> 01:17:40,079
Edward doesn't live in town.

994
01:17:40,752 --> 01:17:42,242
Technically.

995
01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:46,786
He's right outside.

996
01:17:47,191 --> 01:17:48,624
He is?

997
01:17:48,693 --> 01:17:51,662
Yeah, he wanted to meet you, officially.

998
01:17:53,932 --> 01:17:56,196
All right. Bring him in.

999
01:17:58,236 --> 01:17:59,931
Could you be nice?

1000
01:18:01,072 --> 01:18:02,733
He's important.

1001
01:18:14,285 --> 01:18:15,843
Chief Swan.

1002
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,287
I want to formally introduce myself.
I'm Edward Cullen.

1003
01:18:19,357 --> 01:18:20,824
Hi, Edward.

1004
01:18:21,693 --> 01:18:22,955
Bella won't be out too late tonight.

1005
01:18:23,027 --> 01:18:25,393
She's just gonna play baseball
with my family.

1006
01:18:25,463 --> 01:18:26,452
Baseball?

1007
01:18:26,531 --> 01:18:28,431
Yes, sir, that's the plan.

1008
01:18:28,499 --> 01:18:30,694
Bella's gonna play baseball.

1009
01:18:31,836 --> 01:18:33,531
Well, good luck with that.

1010
01:18:33,604 --> 01:18:36,402
I'll take good care of her. I promise.

1011
01:18:39,444 --> 01:18:40,775
Hey.

1012
01:18:41,779 --> 01:18:43,713
Still got that pepper spray?

1013
01:18:43,781 --> 01:18:45,214
Yeah, Dad.

1014
01:18:50,455 --> 01:18:53,185
And since when do vampires like baseball?

1015
01:18:53,257 --> 01:18:55,987
Well, it's the American pastime,

1016
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,620
and there's a thunderstorm coming.

1017
01:18:58,696 --> 01:19:01,290
It's the only time we can play.
You'll see why.

1018
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:15,703
Hey.

1019
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,771
Glad you're here. We need an umpire.

1020
01:19:17,849 --> 01:19:19,373
She thinks we cheat.

1021
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,111
I know you cheat.

1022
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,855
- Call them as you see them, Bella.
- Okay.

1023
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,924
It's time.

1024
01:19:45,143 --> 01:19:48,112
Okay, now I see why you need the thunder.

1025
01:19:52,617 --> 01:19:55,313
That's gotta be a home run, right?

1026
01:19:55,386 --> 01:19:57,251
Edward's very fast.

1027
01:19:58,056 --> 01:20:01,992
<i>Ooh, baby,
don't you know I suffer?</i>

1028
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:05,496
<i>Ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you</i>

1029
01:20:05,563 --> 01:20:07,360
Come home, Rosalie!

1030
01:20:10,334 --> 01:20:12,131
- You're out.
- Out!

1031
01:20:13,304 --> 01:20:15,670
Babe, come on. It's just a game.

1032
01:20:21,512 --> 01:20:22,979
Nice kitty.

1033
01:20:43,634 --> 01:20:45,795
What are you doing?

1034
01:21:03,321 --> 01:21:04,948
My monkey man.

1035
01:21:19,504 --> 01:21:20,835
Stop!

1036
01:21:37,121 --> 01:21:39,851
They were leaving. Then they heard us.

1037
01:21:39,924 --> 01:21:42,017
- Let's go.
- It's too late.

1038
01:21:43,427 --> 01:21:45,224
Get your hair down.

1039
01:21:46,464 --> 01:21:50,059
Like that'll help.
I can smell her from across the field.

1040
01:21:56,107 --> 01:21:58,075
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm so sorry.

1041
01:21:58,142 --> 01:22:01,908
- What? What are you...
- Just be quiet and stand behind me.

1042
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:25,658
I believe this belongs to you.

1043
01:22:28,673 --> 01:22:29,731
Thank you.

1044
01:22:29,807 --> 01:22:31,399
I am Laurent.

1045
01:22:31,742 --> 01:22:33,801
And this is Victoria

1046
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:36,873
and James.

1047
01:22:37,715 --> 01:22:40,206
I'm Carlisle. This is my family.

1048
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:43,315
Hello.

1049
01:22:43,387 --> 01:22:47,221
I'm afraid your hunting activities
have caused something of a mess for us.

1050
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:49,122
Our apologies.

1051
01:22:49,193 --> 01:22:51,889
We didn't realize the territory
had been claimed.

1052
01:22:51,963 --> 01:22:55,455
Yes, well, we maintain
a permanent residence nearby.

1053
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:58,496
Really?

1054
01:23:00,504 --> 01:23:03,598
Well, we won't be a problem anymore.

1055
01:23:04,542 --> 01:23:06,476
We were just passing through.

1056
01:23:06,544 --> 01:23:09,377
The humans were tracking us,
but we led them east.

1057
01:23:09,447 --> 01:23:11,244
You should be safe.

1058
01:23:11,782 --> 01:23:13,409
Excellent.

1059
01:23:14,118 --> 01:23:15,312
So,

1060
01:23:15,786 --> 01:23:18,254
could you use three more players?

1061
01:23:20,024 --> 01:23:22,254
Come on. Just one game.

1062
01:23:23,194 --> 01:23:25,094
Sure. Why not?

1063
01:23:25,162 --> 01:23:27,630
A few of us were leaving.
You could take their place.

1064
01:23:27,698 --> 01:23:29,359
We'll bat first.

1065
01:23:30,301 --> 01:23:32,599
I'm the one with the wicked curveball.

1066
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:35,104
Well, I think we can handle that.

1067
01:23:36,574 --> 01:23:38,064
We shall see.

1068
01:23:58,296 --> 01:24:00,264
You brought a snack.

1069
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:04,064
A human?

1070
01:24:07,438 --> 01:24:09,269
The girl is with us.

1071
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,672
I think it best if you leave.

1072
01:24:15,313 --> 01:24:17,304
I can see the game is over.

1073
01:24:17,381 --> 01:24:18,905
We'll go now.

1074
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:23,552
James.

1075
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,827
Get Bella out of here.

1076
01:24:37,902 --> 01:24:39,164
Go.

1077
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,440
Okay, I've got it! I've got it! I'm all right!

1078
01:24:54,085 --> 01:24:56,553
What, now he's coming after me?

1079
01:25:06,397 --> 01:25:09,230
Listen to me. James is a tracker.
The hunt is his obsession.

1080
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:12,201
I read his mind.
My reaction on the field set him off.

1081
01:25:12,269 --> 01:25:15,602
I just made this his most exciting game ever.

1082
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:17,231
- He's never gonna stop.
- What should we do?

1083
01:25:17,308 --> 01:25:21,074
We have to kill him.
Rip him apart and burn the pieces.

1084
01:25:21,145 --> 01:25:22,840
- Where we going?
- Away from Forks.

1085
01:25:22,913 --> 01:25:25,814
- We'll get a ferry to Vancouver.
- I have to go home. Now.

1086
01:25:25,883 --> 01:25:29,284
- You have to take me home.
- You can't go home.

1087
01:25:29,353 --> 01:25:32,288
He's just gonna trace your scent there.
It's the first place he's gonna look.

1088
01:25:32,356 --> 01:25:34,415
- But my dad is there. We...
- It doesn't matter!

1089
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:37,757
Yes, it does!
He could get killed because of us!

1090
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:40,594
Just let me get you out of here first,
all right?

1091
01:25:40,664 --> 01:25:43,394
It's my dad! We have to go back!

1092
01:25:43,467 --> 01:25:45,230
We'll figure a way
to lead the tracker away somehow.

1093
01:25:45,302 --> 01:25:48,169
I don't know. But we have to do something.

1094
01:25:53,177 --> 01:25:55,839
- Edward, I said leave me alone.
- Bella, don't do this, please.

1095
01:25:55,913 --> 01:25:57,471
It's over! Get out!

1096
01:25:57,548 --> 01:25:59,072
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1097
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:01,209
Bella? What's going on?

1098
01:26:01,919 --> 01:26:05,013
I just gotta get out of here. I'm leaving now.

1099
01:26:06,957 --> 01:26:08,151
Hey.

1100
01:26:11,162 --> 01:26:12,493
Bella?

1101
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:15,421
What am I gonna say to him?

1102
01:26:15,499 --> 01:26:17,194
I can't hurt him.

1103
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:20,502
- Bella, what's going on?
- You just have to.

1104
01:26:21,172 --> 01:26:23,197
I'll be down at the truck.

1105
01:26:28,512 --> 01:26:30,275
Did he hurt you?

1106
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:32,179
No.

1107
01:26:34,351 --> 01:26:36,615
Break up with you or something?

1108
01:26:36,687 --> 01:26:38,746
No, I broke up with him.

1109
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:43,285
I thought you liked him.

1110
01:26:45,696 --> 01:26:47,596
Yeah, that's why I have to leave.

1111
01:26:47,665 --> 01:26:50,361
I don't want this. I have to go home.

1112
01:26:52,169 --> 01:26:53,602
Home? Your...

1113
01:26:53,671 --> 01:26:56,105
Your mom's not even in Phoenix.

1114
01:26:56,173 --> 01:26:57,834
She'll come home.
I'll call her from the road.

1115
01:26:57,908 --> 01:27:00,206
You're not gonna drive home right now.

1116
01:27:00,277 --> 01:27:03,576
You can sleep on it.
If you still feel like going in the morning,

1117
01:27:03,647 --> 01:27:06,275
- I'll take you to the airport.
- No. I want to drive.

1118
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:08,215
It'll give me more time to think.

1119
01:27:08,285 --> 01:27:11,118
I mean, if I get really tired,
I'll pull into a motel. I promise.

1120
01:27:11,188 --> 01:27:14,157
Look, Bella, I know I'm not
that much fun to be around,

1121
01:27:14,225 --> 01:27:18,525
but I can change that.
We can do more stuff together.

1122
01:27:21,799 --> 01:27:23,130
Like what?

1123
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,930
Like watch baseball on the flat-screen?

1124
01:27:26,003 --> 01:27:28,767
Eat at the diner every night?
Steak and cobbler?

1125
01:27:28,839 --> 01:27:31,239
Dad, that's you. That's not me.

1126
01:27:34,678 --> 01:27:36,407
Bella, come on, I just...

1127
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,778
I just got you back.

1128
01:27:41,452 --> 01:27:43,613
Yeah, and, you know, if I don't get out now,

1129
01:27:43,687 --> 01:27:46,781
then I'm just gonna be stuck here like Mom.

1130
01:28:11,081 --> 01:28:13,447
Your father's gonna forgive you.

1131
01:28:14,818 --> 01:28:17,150
Why don't you let me drive?

1132
01:28:22,826 --> 01:28:24,259
He won't.

1133
01:28:25,362 --> 01:28:27,523
You should've seen his face.

1134
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:31,096
I told him the same thing
that my mom told him

1135
01:28:31,168 --> 01:28:32,795
when she was leaving him.

1136
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:35,464
It's the only way he'd let you go.

1137
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:42,577
Just don't worry about him now.
He's safe. The tracker's following us.

1138
01:28:45,349 --> 01:28:47,544
- Oh, God.
- It's just Emmett.

1139
01:28:49,687 --> 01:28:52,019
Alice is in the car behind us.

1140
01:29:13,677 --> 01:29:14,905
Wait.

1141
01:29:15,913 --> 01:29:18,381
He came to warn us about James.

1142
01:29:18,749 --> 01:29:22,742
This isn't my fight,
and I've grown tired of his games,

1143
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:25,755
but he's got unparalleled senses,
absolutely lethal.

1144
01:29:25,823 --> 01:29:28,815
I've never seen anything like him
in my 300 years.

1145
01:29:28,892 --> 01:29:32,760
And the woman, Victoria,
don't underestimate her.

1146
01:29:37,735 --> 01:29:38,929
I've had to fight our kind before.

1147
01:29:39,003 --> 01:29:42,029
- They're not easy to kill.
- But not impossible.

1148
01:29:42,439 --> 01:29:44,532
We'll tear them apart and burn the pieces.

1149
01:29:44,608 --> 01:29:46,508
I don't relish the thought
of killing another creature,

1150
01:29:46,577 --> 01:29:49,102
even a sadistic one like James.

1151
01:29:49,179 --> 01:29:52,478
- What if he kills one of us first?
- I'm gonna run Bella south.

1152
01:29:52,549 --> 01:29:53,709
Can you lead the tracker away from here?

1153
01:29:53,784 --> 01:29:55,718
No, Edward.
James knows you would never leave Bella.

1154
01:29:55,786 --> 01:29:57,811
- He'll follow you.
- I'll go with Bella.

1155
01:29:57,888 --> 01:29:59,981
Jasper and I will drive her south.

1156
01:30:00,057 --> 01:30:01,388
I'll keep her safe, Edward.

1157
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:04,586
- Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
- Yes.

1158
01:30:08,365 --> 01:30:10,299
Rosalie, Esme,

1159
01:30:11,335 --> 01:30:15,396
could you put these on
so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent?

1160
01:30:17,675 --> 01:30:20,041
Why? What is she to me?

1161
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:22,977
Rosalie, Bella is with Edward.

1162
01:30:23,047 --> 01:30:25,413
She's part of this family now,

1163
01:30:26,784 --> 01:30:29,082
and we protect our family.

1164
01:30:46,437 --> 01:30:48,564
Oh, God. If anything...

1165
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:49,867
What if...

1166
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:51,737
If anything happens, I swear to God...

1167
01:30:51,809 --> 01:30:53,777
Nothing's gonna happen.

1168
01:30:53,844 --> 01:30:56,540
There's seven of us,
and there's two of them,

1169
01:30:56,613 --> 01:31:00,276
and when everything's done,
I'm gonna come back and get you.

1170
01:31:02,252 --> 01:31:04,379
Bella, you are my life now.

1171
01:31:22,039 --> 01:31:23,836
Hey, Mom. It's me again.

1172
01:31:23,907 --> 01:31:25,841
You must have let your phone die
or something.

1173
01:31:25,909 --> 01:31:30,073
I'm not in Forks, but everything's okay,
and I'll explain it later.

1174
01:31:37,387 --> 01:31:39,378
Rosalie, mark the tree.

1175
01:31:41,558 --> 01:31:43,355
That's good.

1176
01:32:30,107 --> 01:32:32,268
What is it? What do you see?

1177
01:32:44,354 --> 01:32:45,912
He's figured it out.

1178
01:32:45,989 --> 01:32:48,787
The tracker, he just changed course.

1179
01:32:50,594 --> 01:32:52,255
- Where will it take him, Alice?
- Mirrors.

1180
01:32:52,329 --> 01:32:54,320
A room full of mirrors.

1181
01:32:58,602 --> 01:33:01,696
Edward said the visions
weren't always certain.

1182
01:33:01,772 --> 01:33:04,070
She sees the course people
are on while they're on it.

1183
01:33:04,141 --> 01:33:06,234
If they change their minds,
the vision changes.

1184
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:08,540
Okay, so the course that
the tracker's on now

1185
01:33:08,612 --> 01:33:11,206
is gonna lead him to a ballet studio?

1186
01:33:12,015 --> 01:33:15,007
- You've been here?
- I took lessons as a kid.

1187
01:33:15,819 --> 01:33:17,684
The school I went to
had an arch just like that.

1188
01:33:17,754 --> 01:33:18,982
Was your school here in Phoenix?

1189
01:33:22,059 --> 01:33:23,959
- Edward, are you okay?
- We've lost the tracker.

1190
01:33:24,027 --> 01:33:25,585
The woman's still in the area.

1191
01:33:25,662 --> 01:33:28,256
Rosalie and Esme are going back
to Forks to protect your father.

1192
01:33:28,332 --> 01:33:34,293
I'm coming to get you. Then you and I
are gonna go somewhere alone.

1193
01:33:34,371 --> 01:33:36,032
<i>And the others will keep hunting.</i>

1194
01:33:36,106 --> 01:33:39,303
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you safe again.

1195
01:33:51,121 --> 01:33:53,385
Hey, Mom, I'm glad you got my message.

1196
01:33:53,457 --> 01:33:54,651
What are you doing home?

1197
01:33:54,725 --> 01:33:57,353
<i>Bella? Bella? Bella, where are you?</i>

1198
01:33:58,328 --> 01:34:01,297
Calm down, everything's fine.

1199
01:34:01,365 --> 01:34:03,799
I'll explain everything later.

1200
01:34:03,901 --> 01:34:04,925
Mom, are you there?

1201
01:34:05,002 --> 01:34:09,063
<i>Forks High School doesn't protect
its students' privacy very well.</i>

1202
01:34:09,139 --> 01:34:13,439
It was just too easy for Victoria
to find your previous address.

1203
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:15,944
<i>It's a nice house you have here.</i>

1204
01:34:16,013 --> 01:34:18,277
<i>I was prepared to wait for you,</i>

1205
01:34:18,348 --> 01:34:22,978
<i>but then Mom came home after she received
a very worried call from your dad,</i>

1206
01:34:23,687 --> 01:34:26,121
<i>and it all worked out quite well.</i>

1207
01:34:26,823 --> 01:34:27,949
<i>Wait, wait...</i>

1208
01:34:28,025 --> 01:34:29,322
Don't touch her! Don't...

1209
01:34:29,393 --> 01:34:31,725
You can still save her.

1210
01:34:31,795 --> 01:34:33,990
<i>But you're gonna have to get away
from your friends.</i>

1211
01:34:34,064 --> 01:34:37,192
- Can you handle that?
- Where should I meet you?

1212
01:34:39,202 --> 01:34:41,693
How about your old ballet studio?

1213
01:34:42,339 --> 01:34:45,240
<i>And I'll know if you bring anyone along.</i>

1214
01:34:47,177 --> 01:34:50,476
<i>Poor Mommy would
pay the price for that mistake.</i>

1215
01:35:07,397 --> 01:35:10,696
<i>I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.</i>

1216
01:35:11,268 --> 01:35:15,671
<i>But dying in the place of someone I love
seems like a good way to go.</i>

1217
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:28,344
<i>I can't bring myself to regret the decisions
that brought me face-to-face with death.</i>

1218
01:35:28,418 --> 01:35:30,784
<i>They also brought me to Edward.</i>

1219
01:35:59,683 --> 01:36:02,914
Bella? Bella? Bella, where are you?

1220
01:36:02,986 --> 01:36:04,248
- Mom?
- Bella?

1221
01:36:04,321 --> 01:36:05,845
- Mom?
- There you are.

1222
01:36:05,922 --> 01:36:07,389
<i>What are you doing in here?</i>

1223
01:36:07,457 --> 01:36:09,516
<i>Everyone makes fun of me.</i>

1224
01:36:10,193 --> 01:36:12,787
<i>Come on, you're a wonderful dancer.</i>

1225
01:36:12,863 --> 01:36:14,922
<i>Mom, I suck.</i>

1226
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:18,028
<i>You do not suck.</i>

1227
01:36:28,045 --> 01:36:30,138
That's my favorite part.

1228
01:36:31,048 --> 01:36:33,846
You were a stubborn child, weren't you?

1229
01:36:35,786 --> 01:36:37,947
- She's not even here.
- No.

1230
01:36:40,223 --> 01:36:41,588
Sorry.

1231
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:45,085
You know, but you really made it too easy.

1232
01:36:45,162 --> 01:36:48,461
So to make things more entertaining,

1233
01:36:49,066 --> 01:36:52,297
I'm gonna make a little film
of our time together.

1234
01:36:53,904 --> 01:36:57,305
I borrowed this from your house.
I hope you don't mind.

1235
01:36:57,374 --> 01:36:58,534
Good.

1236
01:36:58,608 --> 01:36:59,939
And

1237
01:37:01,111 --> 01:37:02,442
action.

1238
01:37:04,848 --> 01:37:06,577
That'll break Edward's little heart.

1239
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:09,016
You have...
Edward has nothing to do with this!

1240
01:37:09,086 --> 01:37:10,747
But he does.

1241
01:37:11,788 --> 01:37:14,450
His rage will make for more interesting sport

1242
01:37:14,524 --> 01:37:17,982
than his feeble attempt to protect you.

1243
01:37:19,296 --> 01:37:21,127
And let's continue.

1244
01:37:36,279 --> 01:37:39,578
Beautiful. Very visually dynamic.

1245
01:37:42,586 --> 01:37:44,645
I chose my stage well.

1246
01:37:49,826 --> 01:37:53,318
It's too bad he didn't have
the strength to turn you.

1247
01:37:53,663 --> 01:37:56,393
Instead, he kept you
this fragile little human.

1248
01:37:56,466 --> 01:37:58,400
It's cruel, really.

1249
01:38:03,106 --> 01:38:05,438
Tell Edward how much it hurts.

1250
01:38:05,509 --> 01:38:07,101
Tell him to avenge you. Tell him!

1251
01:38:07,177 --> 01:38:09,975
- No, Edward, don't!
- Tell him! Tell him!

1252
01:38:22,726 --> 01:38:26,184
You're alone
'cause you're faster than the others.

1253
01:38:28,498 --> 01:38:30,159
But not stronger.

1254
01:38:31,701 --> 01:38:34,169
I'm strong enough to kill you.

1255
01:38:40,944 --> 01:38:42,502
I'm sorry.

1256
01:39:46,443 --> 01:39:47,501
Bella, Bella, it's okay.

1257
01:39:47,577 --> 01:39:50,011
Son. Enough.

1258
01:39:50,814 --> 01:39:52,748
Remember who you are.

1259
01:39:57,621 --> 01:39:58,849
Bella, you're okay.

1260
01:39:58,922 --> 01:40:00,583
Bella needs you.

1261
01:40:00,991 --> 01:40:02,686
It's okay.

1262
01:40:02,759 --> 01:40:04,124
Oh, God.

1263
01:40:07,897 --> 01:40:09,797
Carlisle? Her blood.

1264
01:40:09,866 --> 01:40:11,458
- Your brothers will take care of him.
- I got him.

1265
01:40:11,534 --> 01:40:12,796
- Carlisle!
- Start the fire.

1266
01:40:12,869 --> 01:40:15,599
Get the floorboards.

1267
01:40:15,805 --> 01:40:17,898
- Alice!
- Alice, go.

1268
01:40:27,884 --> 01:40:29,909
Her femoral artery's been severed.
She's losing too much blood.

1269
01:40:29,986 --> 01:40:32,216
No, no, my head is burning!

1270
01:40:33,723 --> 01:40:35,452
It's the venom.

1271
01:40:36,326 --> 01:40:40,092
You have to make a choice.
You could let the change happen.

1272
01:40:40,163 --> 01:40:41,460
No.

1273
01:40:42,165 --> 01:40:43,359
No.

1274
01:40:44,701 --> 01:40:48,432
- It's gonna happen, Edward. I've seen it.
- It doesn't have to be that way.

1275
01:40:48,505 --> 01:40:51,474
She's still hemorrhaging.
Alice, make me a tourniquet. Your belt.

1276
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:53,839
Carlisle, what's my other option?

1277
01:40:55,111 --> 01:40:57,238
Tie it above my hands.

1278
01:40:57,314 --> 01:40:58,713
Carlisle!

1279
01:41:00,617 --> 01:41:01,914
Go.

1280
01:41:06,456 --> 01:41:09,289
- We could try to suck the venom out.
- You know I won't be able to stop.

1281
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:11,554
Then find the will to stop.

1282
01:41:12,495 --> 01:41:13,928
But choose.

1283
01:41:13,997 --> 01:41:16,192
She only has minutes left.

1284
01:41:18,368 --> 01:41:20,893
I'm gonna make it go away, Bella.

1285
01:41:23,239 --> 01:41:25,264
I'm gonna make it go away.

1286
01:41:43,626 --> 01:41:47,084
Edward, stop.
Her blood is clean. You're killing her.

1287
01:41:47,831 --> 01:41:49,162
Edward.

1288
01:41:49,666 --> 01:41:50,792
Stop.

1289
01:41:52,001 --> 01:41:53,161
Stop.

1290
01:41:54,738 --> 01:41:56,296
Find the will.

1291
01:42:20,864 --> 01:42:24,061
<i>Death is peaceful, easy.</i>

1292
01:42:31,474 --> 01:42:33,203
<i>Life is harder.</i>

1293
01:42:38,681 --> 01:42:40,012
Bella?

1294
01:42:41,985 --> 01:42:43,179
Baby?

1295
01:42:44,821 --> 01:42:46,049
Bella.

1296
01:42:47,891 --> 01:42:49,324
- Mom?
- Hey.

1297
01:42:50,059 --> 01:42:51,583
Where is he?

1298
01:42:51,661 --> 01:42:53,128
Where's...

1299
01:42:53,596 --> 01:42:55,086
Where's Edward?

1300
01:42:55,165 --> 01:42:56,689
He's asleep.

1301
01:42:57,867 --> 01:42:59,129
He never leaves.

1302
01:42:59,202 --> 01:43:02,228
And your dad, he's down at the cafeteria.

1303
01:43:02,739 --> 01:43:04,366
What happened?

1304
01:43:04,941 --> 01:43:07,808
Well, when you fell, you broke your leg,

1305
01:43:08,812 --> 01:43:11,337
and you lost a lot of blood.

1306
01:43:11,414 --> 01:43:14,178
You don't remember any of this, do you?

1307
01:43:15,752 --> 01:43:17,447
Edward came down with his dad

1308
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,954
to try to convince you
to come back to Forks.

1309
01:43:20,023 --> 01:43:23,390
So you went over to their hotel,
then you tripped,

1310
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:26,224
and you fell down two flights of stairs.

1311
01:43:26,896 --> 01:43:28,864
Went through a window.

1312
01:43:35,004 --> 01:43:36,869
Yeah, that sounds like me.

1313
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:39,067
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1314
01:43:43,012 --> 01:43:44,502
It's Phil.

1315
01:43:45,014 --> 01:43:47,073
He's so worried about you.

1316
01:43:48,485 --> 01:43:49,884
You're texting.

1317
01:43:49,953 --> 01:43:51,784
Finally, yeah.

1318
01:43:53,590 --> 01:43:55,683
I told him to stay down in Florida.

1319
01:43:55,758 --> 01:43:59,819
Honey, you are gonna love Jacksonville.
It's sunny every day,

1320
01:43:59,896 --> 01:44:02,694
and we found the cutest little house,
and you've got your own bathroom.

1321
01:44:02,765 --> 01:44:05,359
Mom, I still want to live in Forks.

1322
01:44:05,969 --> 01:44:07,163
What?

1323
01:44:07,604 --> 01:44:09,595
I want to live in Forks.

1324
01:44:09,973 --> 01:44:12,601
Well, okay, but we'll talk about it.

1325
01:44:14,077 --> 01:44:16,068
Do you mind getting Dad?

1326
01:44:16,779 --> 01:44:19,771
I have to talk to him. Apologize.

1327
01:44:20,383 --> 01:44:22,613
Okay, baby. I'll go get him.

1328
01:44:23,553 --> 01:44:26,386
- And I'll go get a nurse, okay?
- Okay.

1329
01:44:38,201 --> 01:44:40,135
So what happened?

1330
01:44:40,203 --> 01:44:41,795
Where's James?

1331
01:44:42,939 --> 01:44:44,907
We took care of it.

1332
01:44:51,414 --> 01:44:54,042
And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.

1333
01:44:54,584 --> 01:44:56,552
I'm alive because of you.

1334
01:44:56,619 --> 01:44:59,087
No, you're in here because of me.

1335
01:45:00,757 --> 01:45:03,521
The worst part of it was that

1336
01:45:04,627 --> 01:45:07,357
I thought I wasn't gonna be able to stop.

1337
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:08,988
You did stop.

1338
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:14,932
Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville
so I can't hurt you anymore.

1339
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:17,833
What?

1340
01:45:20,977 --> 01:45:23,070
Are you... No!

1341
01:45:23,146 --> 01:45:24,272
No!

1342
01:45:26,215 --> 01:45:27,944
I don't even know what you're... How...

1343
01:45:28,017 --> 01:45:30,850
What are you talking about?
You want me to go away? I can't...

1344
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:33,445
No, I can't... I can't just leave you...

1345
01:45:33,523 --> 01:45:34,854
I know.

1346
01:45:36,759 --> 01:45:38,386
We can't be apart.

1347
01:45:38,461 --> 01:45:40,326
You can't leave me.

1348
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:42,229
I'm here.

1349
01:45:45,702 --> 01:45:47,533
Okay, just don't...

1350
01:45:47,604 --> 01:45:50,835
You just can't say stuff like that to me. Ever.

1351
01:45:55,345 --> 01:45:57,836
Where else am I gonna go?

1352
01:46:47,597 --> 01:46:50,259
Alice lent me the dress.

1353
01:46:50,333 --> 01:46:51,960
The cast is...

1354
01:46:52,902 --> 01:46:54,597
You're perfect.

1355
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:59,538
I'll take care of her, Chief Swan.

1356
01:47:00,443 --> 01:47:02,377
I've heard that before.

1357
01:47:06,549 --> 01:47:08,210
All right, Bells.

1358
01:47:10,453 --> 01:47:13,081
I put a new can of pepper spray in your bag.

1359
01:47:13,156 --> 01:47:14,350
Dad.

1360
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:16,053
And...

1361
01:47:18,094 --> 01:47:20,528
Well, you look beautiful.

1362
01:47:22,665 --> 01:47:23,962
Thanks.

1363
01:47:25,668 --> 01:47:26,999
See you.

1364
01:47:34,043 --> 01:47:37,035
Hey. I'll be right back.

1365
01:47:39,549 --> 01:47:41,244
- Bella.
- Jacob.

1366
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:43,413
Hey.

1367
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:46,415
- Nice.
- You, too.

1368
01:47:47,156 --> 01:47:50,751
Are you crashing the prom or something?
Did you come with a date?

1369
01:47:50,827 --> 01:47:52,089
No.

1370
01:47:55,932 --> 01:47:58,526
My dad paid me to come talk to you.

1371
01:47:59,135 --> 01:48:00,796
Twenty bucks.

1372
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:02,565
Let's hear it.

1373
01:48:03,372 --> 01:48:05,397
Just don't get mad, okay?

1374
01:48:06,976 --> 01:48:09,968
He wants you to break up
with your boyfriend.

1375
01:48:10,313 --> 01:48:13,976
It's just, he said, quote,

1376
01:48:14,817 --> 01:48:16,808
"We'll be watching you."

1377
01:48:18,387 --> 01:48:21,049
- Okay, well, tell him, "Thanks."
- Okay.

1378
01:48:21,524 --> 01:48:24,618
- And to pay up.
- Okay. Let me help you.

1379
01:48:24,694 --> 01:48:25,922
Jacob.

1380
01:48:26,596 --> 01:48:28,587
I'll take it from here.

1381
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:34,158
Guess I'll see you around, Bella.

1382
01:48:35,905 --> 01:48:37,236
All right.

1383
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:47,943
I leave you alone for two minutes,
and the wolves descend.

1384
01:48:54,957 --> 01:48:57,755
- I can't believe you're making me do this.
- Just smile.

1385
01:49:18,447 --> 01:49:21,439
You are really trying to kill me.

1386
01:49:21,517 --> 01:49:26,045
The prom is an important rite of passage.
I didn't want you to miss anything.

1387
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:55,740
Bella, hey!

1388
01:49:58,788 --> 01:50:00,756
Do you want to go?

1389
01:50:00,957 --> 01:50:03,255
All right, slowing it down.

1390
01:50:09,232 --> 01:50:10,756
Shall we?

1391
01:50:11,901 --> 01:50:13,493
You're serious?

1392
01:50:14,637 --> 01:50:16,264
Why not.

1393
01:50:31,621 --> 01:50:33,418
See, you're dancing.

1394
01:50:34,924 --> 01:50:36,323
At prom.

1395
01:50:57,313 --> 01:50:59,747
Edward, why did you save me?

1396
01:50:59,815 --> 01:51:02,283
If you just let the venom spread,

1397
01:51:02,852 --> 01:51:05,047
I could be like you by now.

1398
01:51:06,856 --> 01:51:09,381
You don't know what you're saying.

1399
01:51:10,259 --> 01:51:12,659
- You don't want this.
- I want you.

1400
01:51:12,728 --> 01:51:14,093
Always.

1401
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:22,263
I'm not gonna end your life for you.

1402
01:51:22,338 --> 01:51:24,829
I'm dying already.

1403
01:51:26,742 --> 01:51:28,972
Every second, I get closer.

1404
01:51:29,612 --> 01:51:30,943
Older.

1405
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:33,971
That's the way it's supposed to be.

1406
01:51:34,884 --> 01:51:37,375
Alice said that she saw me like you.

1407
01:51:37,453 --> 01:51:39,785
- I heard her.
- Her visions change.

1408
01:51:39,855 --> 01:51:42,346
Yeah, based on what people decide.

1409
01:51:43,092 --> 01:51:44,684
I've decided.

1410
01:51:48,064 --> 01:51:50,555
So that's what you dream about.

1411
01:51:50,633 --> 01:51:52,430
Becoming a monster.

1412
01:51:55,972 --> 01:51:58,873
I dream about being with you forever.

1413
01:51:58,941 --> 01:52:00,272
Forever?

1414
01:52:05,414 --> 01:52:07,541
And you're ready right now?

1415
01:52:09,585 --> 01:52:10,779
Yes.

1416
01:52:27,837 --> 01:52:32,331
Is it not enough
just to have a long and happy life with me?

1417
01:52:42,651 --> 01:52:44,016
For now.

1418
01:53:12,548 --> 01:53:14,914
<i>No one will surrender tonight,</i>

1419
01:53:16,018 --> 01:53:17,883
<i>but I won't give in.</i>

1420
01:53:19,188 --> 01:53:21,088
<i>I know what I want.</i>
