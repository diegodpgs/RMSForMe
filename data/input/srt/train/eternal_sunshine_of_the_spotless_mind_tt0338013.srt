Hi, Cindy. It's Joel.

13
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:27,550
Listen, I don't feel
very well today.

14
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,469
No, food poisoning,
I think.

I'm sorry?
I just said hi.

Hi, hello.

33
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,422
Okay if I sit closer?

34
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:13,759
How far are you going?

35
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:15,949
Rockville Center.

36
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:17,597
Get out. Me, too.

37
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:19,105
Really?

38
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,141
What are the odds?

39
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:24,812
Listen, do I know you?

40
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:30,067
Do you ever shop
at Barnes and Noble?

41
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:31,284
Sure.

42
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,924
That's it!
Yeah?

43
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,531
I've seen you, man.

44
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:38,869
Book slave there
for five years now.

45
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:40,544
Jesus!

46
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,664
I would have thought
I would remember you.

47
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,583
It might be the hair.

48
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:45,632
What might?

49
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,502
It changes a lot,
the color.

50
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:50,005
That's why you might
not recognize me.

51
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:52,236
It's called Blue Ruin.
Right.

52
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:54,301
The color.
Snappy name, huh?

53
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:55,510
I like it.

54
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:02,476
This company makes
a whole line of colors
with equally snappy names.

55
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,063
You've got Red Menace,
Yellow Fever,
Green Revolution.

56
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:09,837
That would be a job,
coming up with those names.

57
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:13,056
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

58
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:16,240
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be? 15 maybe?

59
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,617
Someone's got that job.

60
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:22,246
Agent Orange.
I came up with that one.

61
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:25,832
I apply my personality
in a paste.

62
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,126
I doubt that very much.

63
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:33,298
Well, you don't know me,
so you don't know, do you?

64
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:40,472
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be nice.

65
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:43,976
Yeah. I got it.

66
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:05,582
My name's Clementine,
by the way.

67
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:06,749
I'm Joel.

68
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,501
Hi, Joel.

69
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,636
No jokes about my name.

70
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,923
Oh, no.
You wouldn't do that.

71
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,633
You're trying to be nice.

72
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,761
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

73
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,430
Huckleberry Hound.

74
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:23,940
I don't know
what that means.

75
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:26,644
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

76
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,563
It's been suggested.

77
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:32,275
O£, my darling, o£, my darling
O£, my darling Clementine

78
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:37,113
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

79
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:38,705
No?

80
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,116
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,119
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.

82
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:47,081
It means merciful, right?
Clemency?

83
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,591
Although it hardly fits.

84
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:52,003
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

85
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,095
I wouldn't think that
about you.

86
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,341
Why wouldn't you think that
about me?

87
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,426
I don't know.

88
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:04,016
You seem nice.

89
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,060
Now I'm nice?

90
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:09,479
Oh, God, don't you know
any other adjectives?

91
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:12,274
I don't need nice.
I don't need myself to be it

92
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,235
and I don't need anybody
to be it at me.

93
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,361
Okay.

94
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,868
It's Joel, right?

95
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:25,246
Yes.

96
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,582
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

97
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,710
I'm a little
out of sorts today.

98
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,270
My embarrassing admission

99
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,849
is I really like
that you're nice right now.

100
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:51,480
I can't tell
from one moment to the next
what I'm going to like,

101
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:54,984
but right now
I'm glad you are.

102
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:06,662
I have some stuff
that I probably should...

103
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:12,001
I'm writing...
I'm sorry. Okay.

104
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:13,669
No.
Sure. That's okay.

105
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:18,717
Take care, then.

106
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:19,801
Jesus.

107
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,278
I could give you a ride
if you need.

108
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,363
It's cold.

109
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,283
Yeah! Okay. It is frosty.

110
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:46,001
You're not a stalker
or anything, right?

111
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:48,914
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one
that talked to me, remember?

112
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:51,208
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

113
00:09:51,243 --> 00:09:53,668
Really?
There's a stalker book?

114
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,298
I've got to read that one.

115
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:06,181
Look, I'm sorry
if I came off sort of nutso.

116
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:08,106
I'm not really.

117
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,311
That's okay.
I didn't think you were.

118
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,861
Do you want
to have a drink?

119
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:22,531
I have lots of drinks,
and I could...

120
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,745
Never mind.
Sorry, that was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.

121
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,372
Good night, Joel.

122
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:51,894
Two Blue Ruins.

123
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,238
Thank you.

124
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:56,566
Drink up, young man.

125
00:10:57,608 --> 00:11:00,570
It'll make
the whole seduction part
less repugnant.

126
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:06,659
I'm just kidding!
Come on.

127
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,793
You're kind of close-mouthed,
aren't you?

128
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:16,919
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:21,507
You know, my life isn't
that interesting.

130
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,386
I go to work, I come home.

131
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:28,639
I don't know what to say.

132
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:31,475
You should read my journal.

133
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:35,313
I mean, it's just blank.

134
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:39,073
Really? Does that
make you sad or anxious?

135
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:42,653
I'm always anxious,
thinking I'm not living
my life to the fullest.

136
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:44,620
Taking advantage
of every possibility

137
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:48,452
and making sure
I'm not wasting one second
of the little time I have.

138
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,704
I think about that.
Yeah?

139
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:57,252
You're really nice.

140
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:00,464
God, I have to stop
saying that.

141
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:05,219
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.

142
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,139
Okay.

143
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:18,148
Joel, you should
come up to the Charles
with me sometime.

144
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,609
It gets frozen
this time of year.

145
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:22,611
That sounds scary.
Exactly.

146
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:26,532
I'll pack a picnic,
a night picnic.

147
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,034
Night picnics are different.

148
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:32,454
That sounds good.

149
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,624
But I should go now.

150
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,397
You should stay.

151
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:39,753
No, I really have...

152
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:42,589
I have to get up
so early and...

153
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:44,754
I would like you
to call me.

154
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:46,885
Would you do that?
I'd like it.

155
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,886
Yes.

156
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:55,435
Wish me
a happy Valentine's Day
when you call.

157
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,187
That'd be nice.

158
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:40,231
What took you so long?

159
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:41,816
I just walked in.

160
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:44,736
You miss me?

161
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:47,614
Oddly enough, I do.

162
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:51,826
You said "I do."
I guess that means
we're married.

163
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:53,411
I guess so.

164
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:56,539
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?

165
00:13:56,915 --> 00:13:59,083
It's really solid
this time of year.

166
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:02,670
I don't know.
Come on.

167
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,347
It's so beautiful.

168
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,017
Isn't it?

169
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:20,773
Don't go too far.

170
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,902
Are you okay?

171
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:30,658
Oh, my ass!

172
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:35,663
I think I should go back.
Come on!

173
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:37,213
But what if it breaks?

174
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:39,625
"What if?"
Do you really care
right now?

175
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:42,127
Come here, please.

176
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,388
Slidey-slidey.

177
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:54,473
This looks good.

178
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:56,517
Let me show you
this one thing.

179
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:58,352
What are you doing?

180
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,147
Come on.

181
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,530
Think I heard a crack.

182
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,200
It's not going to crack.
Or break.

183
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:14,660
It's so thick.

184
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:19,957
Show me
which constellations
you know.

185
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,587
I don't know any.

186
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,549
Show me which ones
you know.

187
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:29,551
Okay.

188
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,267
There's Osidius.

189
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,560
Where?

190
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,146
Right there. See?

191
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:43,732
A sort of a swoop
and a cross.

192
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,234
Osidius the Emphatic.

193
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:50,029
You're full of shit, right?

194
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,865
No. Osidius, right there.

195
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:54,159
Swoop and a cross.

196
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,911
Shut the fuck up!

197
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,177
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

198
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:19,809
Sorry to wake you,
but we're here.

199
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:31,780
Can I come over
to your house,

200
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:36,117
to sleep? I'm so tired.

201
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:40,455
Okay. Yeah, sure.

202
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,958
Let me get my toothbrush.

203
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:06,857
Yes?

204
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:09,151
Can I help you?

205
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:11,320
What do you mean?

206
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:14,407
Can I help you
with something?

207
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:16,450
No.

208
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:19,335
What are you doing here?

209
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,081
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

210
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,294
Thanks.

211
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,538
We're looking for 150.

212
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,872
What number is that?

213
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,332
I don't know
what number that is.

214
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,911
Jesus Christ.
You'd think they'd
light the number

215
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,329
or at least put
a number on...

216
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:24,747
Is that him?
I think so.

217
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:26,374
Yeah, that's him.

218
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,251
That's him.

219
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,101
Hey, Joel.
Frank.

220
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,148
Shit.

221
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,694
Jesus. The only
Valentine's Day cards I get
are from my mother.

222
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:56,654
How pathetic is that?

223
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,283
You're lucky
you have Clementine.
She is way cool.

224
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,286
You got any
big Valentine's Day plans
with her?

225
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,423
No.

226
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,669
It's only a day away.
Better make some
reservations or something.

227
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:13,963
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's, right?

228
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:15,298
McRomance!

229
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,030
You want some fries
with that shake?

230
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:20,595
I have to go to sleep now,
Frank.

231
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,597
It's 8:30.

232
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,003
Patrick, stop it.

233
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,566
Okay.

234
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:22,491
Showtime at the Apollo.

235
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:35,921
Quiet.

236
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:47,058
Get it off your head.

237
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:51,563
Hey, Joel.
What's up?

238
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:54,357
Hi, Frank.

239
00:21:59,946 --> 00:22:04,242
I only get Valentine's Day
cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?

240
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,288
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

241
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,958
You got any
big Valentine's Day plans
with her?

242
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:14,294
No.

243
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:18,256
It's only a day away.
Better make
a reservation somewhere.

244
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:21,218
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's.

245
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,977
Oh, no.
Yes.

246
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:27,474
Valentine's Day
is three days away.
I want it resolved.

247
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:29,774
I'm willing to be the one
to resolve it.

248
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:32,812
So I call her,
and she's changed
her number.

249
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:36,448
So I walked over
to Antic Attic
to get her something.

250
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:40,111
I thought I'd go over to work,
give her an early Valentine.

251
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:43,949
And you won't believe it.

252
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:47,661
She's there with this guy,

253
00:22:48,328 --> 00:22:50,205
this really young guy.

254
00:22:50,664 --> 00:22:54,125
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know
who I am.

255
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:55,836
Excuse me?

256
00:22:56,837 --> 00:22:58,422
Can I help you
find something, sir?

257
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:03,970
Hey, Clem-ato.

258
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:07,848
Patrick! Baby boy!

259
00:23:11,227 --> 00:23:12,728
What are you doing here,
baby?

260
00:23:12,763 --> 00:23:14,153
Just came to surprise you.

261
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:16,691
Let me know
if you need something, sir.

262
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:19,819
How are you?

263
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:22,321
Pretty good, pretty bored,
pretty tired.

264
00:23:23,322 --> 00:23:25,700
I so want
what's in your suit.
Good.

265
00:23:40,673 --> 00:23:42,884
Why would she
do that to me?

266
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:48,681
Does anybody want a joint?

267
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:51,726
God, Rob, give it a rest.

268
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:54,312
God, she's punishing me.
I know.

269
00:23:54,347 --> 00:23:56,696
For being honest.
It's horrible.

270
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:58,795
I should just go
to her house.
No.

271
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,179
You don't want to go there,
man.

272
00:24:01,214 --> 00:24:03,529
Get off me. It's too...
Right.

273
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:06,372
Yeah.
I don't want to
seem desperate.

274
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:08,951
Joel, why don't you
just see this as a sign?

275
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:11,330
Make a clean break. Right?

276
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:17,885
All right, Joel.

277
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,797
Look, man, seriously,
here's the deal.

278
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:23,634
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?

279
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,851
What's your
fucking suggestion?

280
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:27,658
What's your brilliant,
reasoned solution?

281
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:29,431
You're making this
about our shit now?

282
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:30,772
This isn't about us.
I agree.

283
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:33,894
It's not about us.
It's about Joel,
who's an adult, okay?

284
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:35,771
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

285
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:40,234
Why don't you go
do your laundry?

286
00:24:41,777 --> 00:24:43,820
That's great.
That's good.

287
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,292
Okay.

288
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:05,641
What is it?
I don't know.

289
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:08,262
It's some place
that does a thing.

290
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:22,818
Good morning. Lacuna.

291
00:25:23,777 --> 00:25:27,156
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired
after the New Year.

292
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:32,120
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

293
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:33,788
How about on the 5th?

294
00:25:34,956 --> 00:25:36,548
That's a Wednesday.

295
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:39,294
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

296
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:42,338
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

297
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:46,217
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

298
00:25:46,843 --> 00:25:48,303
May I help you?

299
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:50,722
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?

300
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:53,690
I'm Joel Barish.

301
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:55,608
I have an appointment
with Doctor...

302
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:59,063
Mierzwiak.
Here, can you please
fill this out?

303
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:00,321
I just want to talk to him.

304
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:02,191
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.

305
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:03,902
All right.
Thank you.

306
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:07,954
I don't have a pen.

307
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:09,657
There's a pen right there.

308
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,785
Good morning. Lacuna.

309
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:15,017
Yeah, that offer,
that's done now.

310
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:16,998
That expired
after the New Year.

311
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:18,625
Mr. Barish?

312
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:23,178
How are we today?

313
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:24,505
Not too good, actually.

314
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:27,342
Oh, my God! Stan!

315
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:29,135
Sorry, I was just...

316
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,303
I'm working.

317
00:26:33,598 --> 00:26:35,642
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

318
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:39,730
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.

319
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:47,238
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem's...

320
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,073
I assure you, no.
No.

321
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:58,707
There's no such thing as this.

322
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:03,254
Look, our files are
confidential, Mr. Barish,

323
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,214
so I can't show you evidence.

324
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:06,889
Suffice it to say

325
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:10,594
that Miss Kruczynski
was not happy

326
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:13,138
and she wanted to move on.

327
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,065
We provide that possibility.

328
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,395
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy
and wanted to move on.

329
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:22,106
"We provide that possibility."

330
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,567
What the hell is that?

331
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:27,486
I'm the nicest guy
she ever went out with.

332
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,571
Fuck!

333
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:32,248
Rob, give it a rest!

334
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,582
It's okay.
It's all right.

335
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:35,828
Carrie,
I am making a birdhouse.

336
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:42,126
What can I say? You know,
Clementine's just like that.

337
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,919
She's impulsive.

338
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:47,298
She decided to
erase you almost as a lark.

339
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:52,720
A lark?

340
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,600
Why did you do that?

341
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,736
Don't. Wait.

342
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:04,357
I'm sorry, Doctor,
he just barged right in here.

343
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,907
Okay. I want it done.

344
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:08,486
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time...

345
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,579
That's okay, Mary.

346
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:11,913
But there are
people waiting.

347
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:14,499
Mr. Barish,
if you'd like to come inside.

348
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:16,828
If you'd
take care of Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.

349
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,246
Goodbye, Mrs. Woo.

350
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,048
The first thing we need
you to do, Mr. Barish,

351
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,027
is to go home and collect
everything you own

352
00:28:32,062 --> 00:28:34,971
that has some association
with Clementine.

353
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:37,432
Anything.

354
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:41,610
We'll use these items

355
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:45,357
to create a map of Clementine
in your brain, okay?

356
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:49,569
We'll need photos,

357
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,782
clothing, gifts,
books she may have bought you,

358
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:57,911
CDs you may have bought
together, journal entries.

359
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,039
We want to empty your home,

360
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,334
we want to empty your life
of Clementine.

361
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,676
And after the mapping is done,

362
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,049
our technicians
will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

363
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:13,094
That way,
when you awake in the morning,

364
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:15,972
you'll find yourself
in your own bed

365
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,142
as if nothing had happened,
a new life awaiting you.

366
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,232
Wake up, buddy!

367
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:34,031
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

368
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:37,994
You can't have the procedure
done three times in one month.

369
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,329
It's just not
our policy here.

370
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,248
How are you today,
Mr. Barish?

371
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:44,917
Hello, I'm right here.

372
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:48,421
I know it's an emergency.
We'll do everything we can.

373
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:50,054
We can fit you in
on March 1.

374
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,884
Maybe you could
talk to the doctor and...

375
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,844
All right,
so let's make
an appointment.

376
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:58,448
What day would you like
to come in this week?

377
00:29:58,483 --> 00:30:01,017
Mr. Barish.
He's really busy
this afternoon.

378
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,478
Maybe tomorrow
would be better,
around 12:15.

379
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:05,605
Can you do that?

380
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,650
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

381
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:20,953
This is Stan Fink, one
of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

382
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:25,167
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

383
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:27,252
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.

384
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:30,053
My name is Joel Barish,

385
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:33,675
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

386
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:38,931
Very good.
Now tell me about Clementine.

387
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:45,854
I was living with this woman,
Naomi,

388
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:48,982
a couple years ago.

389
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,158
And my friends,
Rob and Carrie,

390
00:30:51,193 --> 00:30:53,028
invited us
to this party at the beach.

391
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:54,279
I don't like parties.

392
00:30:54,404 --> 00:30:57,241
Naomi couldn't go,
but I went

393
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:00,619
and I met Clementine.

394
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:04,129
I'm sorry.

395
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:07,250
We'll start with
your most recent memories

396
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:10,337
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

397
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:14,007
There's an emotional core
to each of our memories,

398
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:15,968
and when you eradicate
that core,

399
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:18,637
it starts
its degradation process.

400
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:20,896
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

401
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:25,018
all the memories
we've targeted will have
withered and disappeared.

402
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:27,104
As in a dream upon waking.

403
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:30,148
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

404
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:35,091
Technically speaking,
the procedure is brain damage.

405
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,491
But it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

406
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,201
Nothing you'll miss.

407
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:43,538
Comfortable?

408
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:46,047
What we're doing here,
Mr. Barish,

409
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:48,397
is actually creating a map
of your brain.

410
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:50,677
Okay, let's get started.

411
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:53,089
If we want to
get this procedure
underway tonight,

412
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:54,514
we have some work to do.

413
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:58,011
I want you to react
to these objects, Mr. Barish,
if you will.

414
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:03,356
There's a good story
behind that...

415
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:07,082
Actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get
a much better emotional
read-out

416
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:10,773
if you refrain from
any sort of verbal description
of the items.

417
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,775
Just please try to
focus on the memories.

418
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,110
I'm sorry.

419
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,158
Healthy activity
up there again.
Healthy read-outs.

420
00:32:20,193 --> 00:32:21,534
Very good.

421
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:23,369
Here's another object.

422
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:25,371
Next item.

423
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,751
Potato head.

424
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,253
Next item.

425
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,799
Just focus
on the memories.

426
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:39,177
Patrick, do me a favor.

427
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,729
Patrick,
do me a favor, will you?

428
00:32:42,764 --> 00:32:46,768
Can you check
the voltage regulator?
What have we got there?

429
00:32:46,803 --> 00:32:49,027
Voltage looks fine.
Really?

430
00:32:49,062 --> 00:32:51,774
I'm not wiping
as clean as I like here.

431
00:32:56,946 --> 00:33:00,414
Technically,
the procedure is brain damage.

432
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:03,118
But it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

433
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:05,412
Check the connections, please.

434
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:09,124
There you are.

435
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:16,549
What am I...

436
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:19,385
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

437
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,304
Why am I standing here...

438
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:23,931
Oh, my God, deja vu.

439
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:29,318
This is so...
We should get started.

440
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:31,730
If we want to
get the procedure
underway tonight,

441
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:33,239
we have some work to do.

442
00:33:33,274 --> 00:33:35,734
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

443
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:37,069
I suppose so.

444
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:39,780
This is about right.

445
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,116
This is
what it would look like.

446
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:45,953
Very good.

447
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:49,248
We'll dispose
of these mementos
when we're done here.

448
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:50,798
That way you won't
be confused later

449
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,711
by their
unexplainable presence
in your home.

450
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:55,838
There we go. Patrick?

451
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,133
Patrick?

452
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,343
Patrick?

453
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:04,144
Why are there
so many wires?

454
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:06,308
Because we have
a lot of equipment.

455
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:07,816
Does that help?

456
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:10,562
Are you sure you set
that thing up properly?

457
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:12,779
How's that?
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

458
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:15,191
There we are, Mr. Barish.
All right,
that's better.

459
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:16,898
I don't know if I like this.

460
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:18,502
I think I might
try this then.

461
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:20,036
We're almost done now.

462
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:22,490
Yourjournal.
That'll be invaluable.

463
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:27,370
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.

464
00:34:27,405 --> 00:34:29,873
"Her name is Clementine
and she's amazing."

465
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,007
Jesus!

466
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:34,878
What?
Come on, careful!
Step back!

467
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:37,255
Just take it easy.

468
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:39,556
It's fine.

469
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:41,051
Let's not roach the guy.

470
00:34:45,388 --> 00:34:46,980
All right.
We got that one.

471
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:49,184
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?

472
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,977
It's an apartment, Patrick.

473
00:34:53,063 --> 00:34:55,523
Well,
not a dump then,
but sort of plain.

474
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:56,816
Uninspired.

475
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,861
And there's sort
of a stale smell.

476
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:04,011
Can we just please
get through this?

477
00:35:04,046 --> 00:35:06,368
We've got
a long night ahead of us.

478
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,377
This is the last time
I saw you.

479
00:35:31,227 --> 00:35:32,520
It's 3:00.

480
00:35:32,937 --> 00:35:37,149
I kind of,
sort of wrecked your car.

481
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:40,736
Driving drunk.
It's pathetic.

482
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:44,198
I was a little tipsy.

483
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:46,033
Don't call me pathetic!

484
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:47,243
It is pathetic.

485
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:49,293
It's fucking irresponsible.

486
00:35:49,328 --> 00:35:51,003
You could have
killed somebody.

487
00:35:51,038 --> 00:35:54,423
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news
and see?

488
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:58,004
Should I check the grille
to see if there's
children or small animals?

489
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,132
It's just a fucking dent.
You're like an old lady
or something.

490
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,717
What are you like?

491
00:36:04,218 --> 00:36:06,929
A wino?
A "wino"? Jesus.

492
00:36:07,138 --> 00:36:10,433
Are you from the '50s
or something? A "wino"?

493
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,442
Face it, Joely.

494
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:17,315
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you.

495
00:36:17,982 --> 00:36:20,276
And in your little,
wormy brain,

496
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:22,320
you're trying to figure out,

497
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:25,031
"Did she fuck
someone tonight?"

498
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:29,827
Now, see, Clem, I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

499
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,706
Isn't that how
you get people
to like you?

500
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,428
I'm sorry, okay?

501
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:49,181
Clem, I didn't mean it,
all right?

502
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,023
Your keys.
I won't need them anymore.

503
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:03,862
I was just angry or annoyed
or something. I don't know.

504
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:15,666
Got it.

505
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:19,002
Mary's coming over tonight.

506
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:21,672
Just thought
you'd want to know.

507
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,347
I like Mary.

508
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:26,176
I like when she comes
to visit. I don't think
she likes me.

509
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,636
She likes you okay.

510
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:31,306
So maybe I should invite
my girlfriend over.

511
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:32,745
I have a girlfriend now.

512
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,170
Do whatever you want.

513
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:35,561
Did I tell you...

514
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:43,527
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

515
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,737
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.

516
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,871
The thing is,

517
00:37:47,906 --> 00:37:51,202
my situation is
a little weird.

518
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,454
My girlfriend situation.

519
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,164
I'm sure it is.

520
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:57,667
You've got to be...

521
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:25,569
Clem, let me drive you home.

522
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,363
Get out of my face, faggot!

523
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:31,910
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

524
00:38:32,785 --> 00:38:34,579
I'm erasing you,
and I'm happy!

525
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:36,956
You did it to me first!

526
00:38:37,457 --> 00:38:40,752
I can't believe
you did this to me!
God damn it!

527
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:43,504
Did you hear me?

528
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,424
By morning you'll be gone!

529
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:50,136
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

530
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:58,686
Is there
something wrong with a girl
being attracted to me?

531
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:01,564
Is that a problem?
No, I think it's funny.

532
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:05,152
Who do you think's
better-looking,
me or this guy?

533
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:06,987
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.

534
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:09,990
Remember that girl
we did last week?

535
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:12,534
The one with the potatoes?

536
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:16,295
That girl?

537
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,915
Yeah, that's this guy's girl.

538
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:20,584
Right, was.

539
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:23,629
We took care of that.

540
00:39:26,423 --> 00:39:28,842
I kind of fell in love
with her that night.

541
00:39:28,877 --> 00:39:31,512
What? You little fuck.

542
00:39:31,547 --> 00:39:32,603
What?

543
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:34,640
She was unconscious, man.

544
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:36,934
She was beautiful.

545
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:41,188
I stole a pair of her panties,
as well.

546
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,407
Jesus!

547
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:48,049
What? It's not like...
I mean, they were
clean and all.

548
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:50,725
Don't tell me this.
I don't want to hear
this shit.

549
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,398
They were clean.
What? Don't. Stop.

550
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,036
Okay, all right.
We've got work to do.

551
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,038
Hold my papers.

552
00:40:14,763 --> 00:40:16,223
There's more.

553
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,773
After we did her,
I kind of asked her out.

554
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,444
What?

555
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:28,653
Jesus.

556
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:36,293
...how unethical...

557
00:40:36,328 --> 00:40:39,080
It's not really that bad.

558
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:42,542
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

559
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:45,170
Patrick,
you stole a girl's panties.

560
00:40:57,432 --> 00:40:59,226
There's someone here.

561
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:02,646
He stole your underwear.

562
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,940
I don't see anyone.

563
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:26,294
Joel, where are my boots?

564
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:28,964
Now, why are you
showing me poisons?

565
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,236
Can't you understand English?

566
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:33,344
Potions, I said. Potions.

567
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:42,360
£ove potion, please.

568
00:41:42,395 --> 00:41:45,815
I'm fucking
crawling out of my skin!

569
00:41:48,526 --> 00:41:51,237
I should have left you
at the flea market.

570
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,835
Want to go?

571
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:08,713
I want to have a baby.

572
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:12,487
Let's talk about it later.

573
00:42:12,522 --> 00:42:14,802
No. I want to have a baby.

574
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:18,472
I don't think we're ready.

575
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,100
You're not ready.

576
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,396
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

577
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:27,398
What?

578
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:30,651
I don't want to
talk about it here.

579
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:31,826
I can't hear you.

580
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:34,196
I can
never the fuck understand
what you're saying.

581
00:42:34,231 --> 00:42:36,073
I said I don't want to
talk about this!

582
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:38,332
We're fucking gonna
talk about it!

583
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:41,829
You can't just say that
and say you don't wanna
talk about it.

584
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:44,040
I'm sorry.
I'd make
a fucking good mother.

585
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:45,506
I love children.

586
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:49,087
I'm creative,
I'm smart, and I'd make
a fucking great mother!

587
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:50,429
It's you, Joel.

588
00:42:50,464 --> 00:42:51,924
It's you who can't
commit to anything.

589
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:53,098
It's going.

590
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,184
You've no idea
how lucky you are
I'm interested in you.

591
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:58,889
I don't even know why I am.
Maybe I should
end it right here!

592
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:02,514
Leave you at the flea market
with the stupid
costume jewelry!

593
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:06,104
Maybe you can find a nice
antique rocking chair
to die in!

594
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:17,261
Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary, how's it going?

595
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:19,284
Hey, you.
It's freezing outside.

596
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:20,577
Did you find us okay?

597
00:43:20,612 --> 00:43:21,536
Yeah.

598
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,626
Hot.

599
00:43:29,503 --> 00:43:30,712
Poor guy.

600
00:43:33,757 --> 00:43:35,926
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

601
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:38,470
We haven't checked yet.

602
00:43:40,931 --> 00:43:42,641
Let me do the honors.

603
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:46,061
Mary hates me.

604
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,960
Never really had
much luck with the ladies.

605
00:43:48,995 --> 00:43:51,400
Maybe if you stopped
stealing their panties.

606
00:43:53,986 --> 00:43:55,529
There's more.
No.

607
00:43:55,564 --> 00:43:56,780
Yes.
No.

608
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,788
You didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

609
00:44:03,823 --> 00:44:05,915
No, I don't know.
That's okay.

610
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:08,716
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful,

611
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:11,671
"for they get the better
even of their blunders."

612
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:23,850
That's Nietzsche.

613
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:26,853
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.

614
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:29,772
What's your Bartlett's?

615
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:31,733
It's a quote book, Patrick.

616
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:33,992
It's a book of quotations.

617
00:44:34,027 --> 00:44:36,654
I think Howard will be
in Bartlett's one day.

618
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:38,489
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

619
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:44,252
Can you wake him up?

620
00:44:44,287 --> 00:44:45,663
You can't wake him up.

621
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:56,799
You don't tell me things,
Joel.

622
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:00,303
I'm an open book.

623
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:03,306
I tell you everything.

624
00:45:03,598 --> 00:45:06,517
Every damn embarrassing thing.

625
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:11,356
You don't trust me.

626
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:15,151
Constantly talking isn't
necessarily communicating.

627
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:19,490
I don't do that.

628
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:24,161
I want to know you.

629
00:45:27,164 --> 00:45:30,125
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus.

630
00:45:32,253 --> 00:45:34,838
People have to share things,
Joel.

631
00:45:36,382 --> 00:45:38,342
That's what intimacy is.

632
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:41,762
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

633
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:43,097
I'm sorry.

634
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,725
My life just isn't
that interesting.

635
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,543
I wanna read
some of those journals you're
constantly scribbling in.

636
00:45:51,578 --> 00:45:55,526
What do you write
if you don't have any thoughts
or passions or love?

637
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:06,870
"November 19, 2003.

638
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:09,999
"Dinner at Kang's again.

639
00:46:12,543 --> 00:46:14,962
"Are we like
those poor couples

640
00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:18,507
"you feel sorry for
in restaurants?

641
00:46:18,757 --> 00:46:20,759
"Are we the dining dead?"

642
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:25,639
I can't stand the idea
of us being a couple
people think that about.

643
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:31,396
I like that.

644
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:36,151
How's the chicken?

645
00:46:36,818 --> 00:46:37,903
Good.

646
00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:42,073
More?
No, thank you.

647
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:47,787
She's going to be drunk
and stupid now.

648
00:46:48,413 --> 00:46:52,042
Would you do me a favor
and clean the goddamn hair
off the soap

649
00:46:52,077 --> 00:46:53,668
when you're done
in the shower?

650
00:46:53,703 --> 00:46:55,378
It's really...
Yeah.

651
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,422
It's gross.
Gross.

652
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:02,302
I think it's just...
Repulsive.

653
00:47:02,337 --> 00:47:03,929
It's repulsive.

654
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,103
Patrick,
can we get through this?

655
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,898
Hey, Tangerine.

656
00:47:16,524 --> 00:47:18,151
Patrick, it's you.

657
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:21,529
I'm so miserable right now.

658
00:47:22,322 --> 00:47:23,788
Why? What's wrong?

659
00:47:23,823 --> 00:47:27,077
I don't know. I'm just
confused about everything.

660
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:29,287
Confused?

661
00:47:29,537 --> 00:47:32,499
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.

662
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,092
Do you love me?

663
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:43,350
Of course I do.

664
00:47:43,385 --> 00:47:45,221
Where's
the self-help section?

665
00:47:46,222 --> 00:47:47,890
Do you think I'm ugly?

666
00:47:47,925 --> 00:47:49,559
No. You're beautiful.

667
00:47:50,184 --> 00:47:53,521
Maybe I should come over.
No. I don't know.

668
00:47:53,813 --> 00:47:55,648
I'm a mess, Patrick.

669
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:59,443
Just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.

670
00:47:59,478 --> 00:48:00,570
Okay.

671
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,864
Can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

672
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:07,326
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

673
00:48:07,368 --> 00:48:09,787
Let him go, Stan.
I'll help.

674
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:13,047
See?
How hard can it be?

675
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:14,792
She hates me.
She wants me to go.

676
00:48:14,827 --> 00:48:15,960
Go.

677
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,630
All right.
I'll be right over,
Tangerine.

678
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:21,048
You like?

679
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:27,221
I matched
my sweatshirt exactly.

680
00:48:27,256 --> 00:48:28,521
I like it.
You do?

681
00:48:28,556 --> 00:48:30,308
You look like a tangerine.

682
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:33,561
Clementine the tangerine.

683
00:48:34,103 --> 00:48:35,855
Juicy and seedless.

684
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:36,939
I like that.

685
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:40,985
I like tangerines.

686
00:48:41,903 --> 00:48:43,154
Can you see me
doing ducks?

687
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:44,280
Tangerine.

688
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,909
How does he know
to call you that?

689
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:49,368
How did who know?

690
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:51,537
Oh, my God. Clem?
This is pretty cool.

691
00:48:51,572 --> 00:48:53,953
That's what
they called themselves.

692
00:48:53,988 --> 00:48:56,299
The Clash,
the only band that mattered.

693
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,586
And they called themselves
that for a reason.

694
00:48:58,621 --> 00:49:00,839
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice.

695
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:02,796
Yeah,
it's totally incredible.

696
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:04,718
What Howard
gives to the world.

697
00:49:06,428 --> 00:49:07,512
Yeah.

698
00:49:08,263 --> 00:49:10,265
To let people begin again.

699
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:13,775
It's beautiful.

700
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:17,272
You look at a baby,
and it's so pure and so free

701
00:49:17,307 --> 00:49:19,566
and so clean.

702
00:49:20,067 --> 00:49:22,861
Adults are this
mess of sadness

703
00:49:24,738 --> 00:49:26,281
and phobias.

704
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:28,575
And Howard
just makes it all go away.

705
00:49:42,464 --> 00:49:43,799
Baby, what's going on?

706
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:45,592
I don't know.

707
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:49,304
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.

708
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:52,307
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!

709
00:49:52,342 --> 00:49:53,642
Nothing makes
any sense to me!

710
00:49:53,677 --> 00:49:55,953
You're not getting old.

711
00:49:55,988 --> 00:49:58,230
Nothing makes any sense.

712
00:49:58,355 --> 00:49:59,731
Tangerine.

713
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,444
It's okay.

714
00:50:05,195 --> 00:50:07,364
Let's go out dancing.

715
00:50:07,864 --> 00:50:09,866
You want to go out
to Montauk with me?

716
00:50:09,901 --> 00:50:11,166
Montauk?

717
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:13,119
No, come up
to Boston with me.

718
00:50:13,154 --> 00:50:15,911
Sure. We can go next weekend.

719
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,633
No, now. I have to go now.

720
00:50:18,668 --> 00:50:20,670
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

721
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:26,217
Hi, it's Joel.

722
00:50:28,177 --> 00:50:32,599
£eave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.

723
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,269
Pick up.

724
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:43,943
Hello? What's up?

725
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,911
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

726
00:50:46,946 --> 00:50:49,949
Can you handle things tonight
alone? I'm really sorry.

727
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:52,869
Don't worry about it.
I've got it under control.

728
00:50:52,904 --> 00:50:55,038
He's pretty much
on auto-pilot now, anyway.

729
00:50:55,073 --> 00:50:56,706
Thanks.
I owe you big-time.

730
00:50:56,741 --> 00:50:58,124
Dude, I got to go.

731
00:51:12,096 --> 00:51:14,772
"Look. You and me
on the Charles River.

732
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:17,769
"I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.

733
00:51:18,228 --> 00:51:21,481
"I've never felt that before.
I'm exactly where I want..."

734
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:24,379
I'm so excited.

735
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,027
I'm excited, too.

736
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:27,195
Cool.

737
00:51:30,574 --> 00:51:33,911
I got you this thing.

738
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:38,499
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Thank you.

739
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:43,712
What is it?

740
00:51:43,754 --> 00:51:45,172
I don't know. Open it up.

741
00:51:52,972 --> 00:51:54,605
It's gorgeous.

742
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,226
You like it?
It's just my taste, really.

743
00:51:57,768 --> 00:52:01,647
God, I've never gone out
with a guy who bought
me jewelry I liked.

744
00:52:02,773 --> 00:52:04,066
Thank you.

745
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:13,325
Let's go.
Okay.

746
00:52:13,617 --> 00:52:16,620
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?

747
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:19,582
Am I ugly?

748
00:52:22,293 --> 00:52:24,420
When I was a kid,
I thought I was.

749
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,549
Can't believe
I'm crying already.

750
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:30,850
Sometimes I think

751
00:52:30,885 --> 00:52:34,054
people don't understand
how lonely it is to be a kid.

752
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:37,057
Like you don't matter.

753
00:52:39,435 --> 00:52:40,901
So, I'm eight,

754
00:52:40,936 --> 00:52:44,316
and I have these toys,
these dolls.

755
00:52:45,275 --> 00:52:49,487
My favorite
is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

756
00:52:50,447 --> 00:52:52,324
And I keep yelling at her,

757
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:55,243
"You can't be ugly.
Be pretty."

758
00:52:56,536 --> 00:52:59,831
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,

759
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,960
I would magically
change, too.

760
00:53:09,507 --> 00:53:10,967
You're pretty.

761
00:53:12,844 --> 00:53:14,241
Don't ever leave me.

762
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:15,639
You're pretty.

763
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:22,229
Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.

764
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:23,480
Just this one.

765
00:53:24,522 --> 00:53:26,942
I don't want
to hold your hand. Come on.

766
00:53:30,862 --> 00:53:32,072
Stop it!

767
00:53:34,616 --> 00:53:36,534
I could die right now.

768
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:43,041
I'm just so happy.

769
00:53:46,545 --> 00:53:48,672
I've never felt
that before.

770
00:53:52,008 --> 00:53:53,718
I'm just exactly

771
00:53:56,806 --> 00:53:58,474
where I want to be.

772
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:11,529
I want to call it off.
I'll give you a sign.

773
00:54:17,326 --> 00:54:19,203
I want to call it off.

774
00:54:20,997 --> 00:54:25,293
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I want to call it off!

775
00:54:32,425 --> 00:54:34,927
Is anybody there?

776
00:54:52,278 --> 00:54:54,412
What?
We've got to go.

777
00:54:54,447 --> 00:54:57,575
Where?
I have an idea
of how to stop this.

778
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:58,826
Stop what?

779
00:55:04,624 --> 00:55:06,591
Don't tickle me. No.

780
00:55:06,626 --> 00:55:08,461
Smell my pits!

781
00:55:09,462 --> 00:55:11,131
Concentrate, Clem.

782
00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:14,864
We have to get back
to the office.
Halloween.

783
00:55:14,899 --> 00:55:17,429
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.

784
00:55:20,515 --> 00:55:22,226
Back here. Come on.

785
00:55:22,935 --> 00:55:25,938
Look at me.
I want to go there.

786
00:55:25,979 --> 00:55:30,400
Our files are confidential,
so I can't show you evidence.

787
00:55:30,984 --> 00:55:34,571
Suffice it to say
that Miss Kruczynski

788
00:55:34,606 --> 00:55:38,158
was not happy
and she wanted to move on.

789
00:55:39,618 --> 00:55:41,001
Tell me about...

790
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:44,206
Tell me
everything you remember.
That's what he said.

791
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:46,215
What did we
see that day?

792
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:50,045
We're going to see
my grandma.
Shit!

793
00:55:50,462 --> 00:55:52,714
Joel, why...
No. We're not
going on a train.

794
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,967
Joel, please.
Don't make me run anymore.

795
00:55:55,002 --> 00:55:56,301
Come on.

796
00:55:56,343 --> 00:55:57,302
Mierzwiak!

797
00:55:58,595 --> 00:56:00,722
Do we always have to run?

798
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:12,484
Please?

799
00:56:13,694 --> 00:56:18,407
Why don't we begin by
you telling me everything
you can remember...

800
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:21,201
Mierzwiak,
wake me up!

801
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,292
I'm sorry, Mr. Barish,
I thought you understood
what was going on.

802
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:31,963
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her.

803
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:40,847
You got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

804
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,273
I'm in my brain.

805
00:56:43,308 --> 00:56:46,498
I'm part of
your imagination, too.

806
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:49,654
How can I help
you from there?

807
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:52,525
I'm inside your head, too.
I'm you.

808
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:56,863
Sorry.

809
00:56:56,905 --> 00:56:58,448
Look, who's that?

810
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:02,326
He works for us.

811
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:05,705
That's Patrick,

812
00:57:05,997 --> 00:57:07,874
baby boy.

813
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:12,045
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.

814
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,091
He's seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

815
00:57:17,126 --> 00:57:19,010
He stole her underwear.

816
00:57:19,802 --> 00:57:22,388
Jesus Christ.
He stole her underwear.

817
00:57:23,723 --> 00:57:25,391
I could die right now, Clem.

818
00:57:25,934 --> 00:57:26,935
I'm just happy.

819
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:30,230
I've never felt that before.

820
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,357
I'm exactly
where I want to be.

821
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:36,486
I want to go home.

822
00:57:38,613 --> 00:57:39,697
What?

823
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:47,081
Wait, Clem.

824
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:52,127
Clem, they're erasing you.

825
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:54,838
Over here!

826
00:57:55,548 --> 00:57:57,049
Clem, focus.

827
00:57:57,216 --> 00:58:00,094
I hired them, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.

828
00:58:00,135 --> 00:58:03,138
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

829
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:06,809
I need it to stop
before I wake up
and don't know you anymore.

830
00:58:10,145 --> 00:58:12,106
Just tell them
to cancel it then.

831
00:58:12,773 --> 00:58:14,358
What the hell are you
talking about?

832
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:16,110
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.

833
00:58:16,986 --> 00:58:18,452
Wake yourself up!

834
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:20,621
Okay, you want me to wake up?
All right.

835
00:58:20,656 --> 00:58:23,117
Okay, here we go.
Will it make you happy
if I try?

836
00:58:23,152 --> 00:58:24,792
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.

837
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:27,288
Here we go.
That was a great idea.

838
00:58:29,999 --> 00:58:32,209
That's working
like gangbusters.

839
00:58:33,002 --> 00:58:35,337
Don't!
That tickles me!

840
00:58:36,922 --> 00:58:39,425
What the hell is that?
It's a birthmark!

841
00:58:42,678 --> 00:58:44,680
It did work, for a second.

842
00:58:46,015 --> 00:58:47,641
But I couldn't...
See?

843
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:49,226
I couldn't move.

844
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:53,522
Isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling
prophecies?

845
00:58:53,557 --> 00:58:56,151
It's more important
to prove me wrong
than to actually...

846
00:58:56,186 --> 00:58:59,154
I don't want to discuss this
right now, okay?

847
00:58:59,189 --> 00:59:00,280
Fine.

848
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:05,660
Then what? I'm listening.

849
00:59:05,702 --> 00:59:07,836
I don't know.
You erased me.

850
00:59:07,871 --> 00:59:10,457
That's why I'm here
and doing this.

851
00:59:10,582 --> 00:59:14,336
I'm sorry.
You know me, I'm impulsive.

852
00:59:18,673 --> 00:59:20,842
That's what I love about you.

853
00:59:27,015 --> 00:59:29,517
I have another idea
for this problem.

854
00:59:29,726 --> 00:59:31,519
This is a memory of me.

855
00:59:31,561 --> 00:59:34,022
The way you wanted
to have sex on the couch

856
00:59:34,064 --> 00:59:36,441
after you look down
at my crotch.

857
00:59:37,817 --> 00:59:39,945
The eraser guys are coming,

858
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,447
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

859
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:44,157
somewhere where
I don't belong,

860
00:59:44,574 --> 00:59:46,034
and we hide there
till morning?

861
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:55,335
I can't remember anything
without you.

862
00:59:56,544 --> 00:59:59,256
That's very sweet,
but try, okay?
Okay.

863
01:00:07,889 --> 01:00:11,894
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

864
01:00:12,895 --> 01:00:16,524
Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

865
01:00:25,283 --> 01:00:28,578
It's working.
I'm a genius.

866
01:00:56,689 --> 01:00:58,316
Where did you go?

867
01:00:58,941 --> 01:01:00,950
I'm supposed to come, too!

868
01:01:00,985 --> 01:01:02,577
I'm just gonna go
get a salad bowl.

869
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:04,405
Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?

870
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,111
He likes to be near me.

871
01:01:06,146 --> 01:01:07,783
Absolutely.

872
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:11,913
It worked.
My God, look at this.

873
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,707
It worked!

874
01:01:15,374 --> 01:01:16,918
Look at this dress, man.

875
01:01:18,669 --> 01:01:19,879
I wish I could
take it with me.

876
01:01:22,423 --> 01:01:24,551
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.

877
01:01:24,676 --> 01:01:25,851
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

878
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:28,555
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

879
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:32,267
Found the salad bowl.
I'm serving salad
and string beans.

880
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:35,187
Is he okay under there?
Honey, are you all right?

881
01:01:35,222 --> 01:01:37,446
I feel like
I could clean up all day.

882
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:40,400
Would you hate me
if I asked you to clean
some string beans?

883
01:01:40,435 --> 01:01:43,528
No, not at all.
God, I love this kitchen.

884
01:01:43,862 --> 01:01:45,530
Thank you so much.

885
01:01:45,948 --> 01:01:48,450
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.

886
01:01:50,494 --> 01:01:53,705
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

887
01:01:53,956 --> 01:01:55,457
Oh, baby Joel.

888
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,794
Is every little peanut
under there okay?

889
01:01:58,829 --> 01:02:00,135
He's fine.

890
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:01,929
Do you have
something to drink?

891
01:02:01,964 --> 01:02:04,508
How about a cocktail?
I know it's not 5:00...

892
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,682
I would die for a vodka.

893
01:02:05,717 --> 01:02:07,267
Let me check
if I have that.

894
01:02:07,302 --> 01:02:09,137
Okay, I'm just going
to wait right here.

895
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:12,189
No, sweetie. Joely?

896
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:15,477
Your mother
wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.

897
01:02:15,512 --> 01:02:16,568
Ice cream.

898
01:02:16,603 --> 01:02:20,399
No, not until
after you've had your dinner.

899
01:02:20,434 --> 01:02:23,986
Come on! Grow up.

900
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:25,702
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God.

901
01:02:25,737 --> 01:02:28,240
No, I'm right here.
This is sort of warped.

902
01:02:28,275 --> 01:02:31,177
I'm scared.
I want my mommy.

903
01:02:31,212 --> 01:02:34,079
Don't cry, baby Joel.
It's okay.

904
01:02:36,456 --> 01:02:40,295
Joel, stop it!
I think it's working.
We're hidden, Joel. Look!

905
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:42,046
Honey, look.

906
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:44,299
Wait there.

907
01:02:48,303 --> 01:02:51,681
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

908
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:52,932
Yuck.

909
01:02:57,395 --> 01:02:59,647
It stopped.
What?

910
01:03:00,773 --> 01:03:02,483
It stopped erasing.

911
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:06,571
Oh, shit!
This is terrible.

912
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,457
He's off the map.

913
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:14,913
Where?
I don't know where.

914
01:03:15,246 --> 01:03:19,042
This is very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

915
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,054
Crap! What did we do?
What do I do?

916
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:27,592
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.

917
01:03:27,634 --> 01:03:30,929
What shall we do?
I just said, I don't know.

918
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:32,597
I'm sorry.
What shall we do?

919
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:35,899
I don't know. Mellow out.
You're freaking me out.

920
01:03:35,934 --> 01:03:40,125
We have to do something.
He could wake up
all half-baked.

921
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,317
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
All gooey and half-baked.

922
01:03:45,276 --> 01:03:48,008
That sounds so good.
I'm hungry.

923
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:50,740
Oh, shit. What?

924
01:03:52,284 --> 01:03:53,918
We should call Howard.

925
01:03:53,953 --> 01:03:57,831
No way. No sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.

926
01:03:57,866 --> 01:03:59,708
You can't call Howard.

927
01:04:01,252 --> 01:04:03,135
There's no time
to fuck around.

928
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:05,506
I've got this under control.
What are you talking about?

929
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,712
Stop fucking around.

930
01:04:06,747 --> 01:04:07,883
Okay. I'll call Howard.

931
01:04:16,016 --> 01:04:17,107
Hello?

932
01:04:17,142 --> 01:04:21,564
Howard, it's Stan.
I'm working on this guy
down here.

933
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,190
We've lost him
for a moment,

934
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:26,485
and I can't
bring him back up.

935
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:30,120
Okay, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

936
01:04:30,155 --> 01:04:33,492
I wasn't sure
because I was away
from the monitor for a minute,

937
01:04:33,534 --> 01:04:37,413
and I had it on auto-pilot
because I had to pee.

938
01:04:37,448 --> 01:04:39,164
Where was Patrick?

939
01:04:39,206 --> 01:04:41,750
He had to go home sick.

940
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:45,838
What's the address?

941
01:04:45,879 --> 01:04:47,068
I know,
I'm so sorry.

942
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,222
That's okay. Come on.

943
01:04:48,257 --> 01:04:50,426
We're at 159 South Village.

944
01:04:50,759 --> 01:04:53,512
Apartment 1-E.
Rockville Center.

945
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:55,848
Mary, he's coming right now.

946
01:04:56,056 --> 01:04:57,057
I'm staying.

947
01:04:58,225 --> 01:05:00,185
Get your stuff, Mary.

948
01:05:00,728 --> 01:05:02,021
I think you should go.

949
01:05:02,396 --> 01:05:03,439
No.

950
01:05:07,068 --> 01:05:08,695
I am so stoned.

951
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:11,872
Please, Mary,
you have to go.

952
01:05:11,907 --> 01:05:15,285
Stop being stoned.
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

953
01:05:16,244 --> 01:05:20,332
You have no idea
how much trouble I'll get into
if Howard comes...

954
01:05:20,624 --> 01:05:23,501
Joel, stop. Look.

955
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:34,012
I want her to pick me up.
Weird how strong
that desire is.

956
01:05:34,047 --> 01:05:37,224
Joel, look at me.
You'll remember me
in the morning,

957
01:05:37,265 --> 01:05:41,102
you'll come to me,
you'll tell me about us,
and we'll start over.

958
01:05:42,562 --> 01:05:45,732
Pat? I thought we could
have a little cocktail.

959
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:48,526
That Patrick guy,
he's copying me.

960
01:05:48,561 --> 01:05:49,986
What Patrick guy?

961
01:05:50,153 --> 01:05:51,905
That guy.
What?

962
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:54,039
He's here, in my apartment.

963
01:05:54,074 --> 01:05:57,702
One of the eraser guys.
He fell for you
when they were doing you,

964
01:05:57,737 --> 01:06:01,331
and now
he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

965
01:06:01,706 --> 01:06:03,917
and you guys are dating.
Really?

966
01:06:04,918 --> 01:06:06,044
Is he cute?

967
01:06:08,546 --> 01:06:10,722
There's nothing wrong
with you.

968
01:06:10,757 --> 01:06:13,802
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

969
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:17,973
You're kind, beautiful,

970
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:23,396
smart, funny, and nice.

971
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,565
What?

972
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,818
Okay, all right.

973
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,075
Move. Come on,
let's go.
Careful.

974
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,787
I'm still stoned.

975
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,958
Those eye drops
you gave me didn't do shit.

976
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:49,922
Be cool.

977
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,561
Hello, Mary,
what are you doing here?

978
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:58,354
Hi, Howard.
She was just here
to help out.

979
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:01,642
I wanted to understand
as much about the procedure
as possible.

980
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:06,147
I think it's important
for my job to understand
the inner workings

981
01:07:06,182 --> 01:07:07,822
of the work that we do.

982
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:11,235
Not that I do,
but the work that is done

983
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,154
by people where I also work.

984
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,739
The work of my colleagues.

985
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:19,744
Let's see if we can
get to the bottom of this,
shall we?

986
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,465
That's odd.

987
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,050
I already tried that.

988
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,337
You tried going through
the C-gate?

989
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,172
Of course.

990
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,466
I mean, yes.

991
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,514
All right.

992
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:44,228
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.

993
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:50,087
I ran the utility programs,
and I had nothing there,

994
01:07:50,122 --> 01:07:53,820
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

995
01:07:53,855 --> 01:07:57,074
Here, Howard,
I got you a chair.
Thank you.

996
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:59,201
There you go.
You're welcome.

997
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:01,793
All right.
I've got it.

998
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,581
I'll go through
the entire memory,

999
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:05,874
see if something
comes up.

1000
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:15,342
I love being bathed
in the sink.

1001
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:17,469
Such a feeling of security.

1002
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:20,889
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.

1003
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,225
There it is.

1004
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:26,853
I don't understand
why it's off the map
like that.

1005
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:30,399
What the heck
was he doing there?

1006
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,034
His eyes are open.

1007
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,331
Has this happened before
with him?
No.

1008
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:49,793
This is not good.

1009
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:55,675
I'm going to have
to give him this.

1010
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,368
Can't you see
I love you, Antoine?

1011
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:24,996
Okay, we're back in.

1012
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:32,128
That was beautiful to watch,
Howard, like a surgeon
or a concert pianist.

1013
01:09:34,547 --> 01:09:36,132
Thank you, Mary.

1014
01:09:36,925 --> 01:09:40,261
Howard, you should
get some sleep.
I think I'll be fine now.

1015
01:09:40,296 --> 01:09:43,890
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1016
01:09:45,433 --> 01:09:48,144
Lucky me. Lay one on me.

1017
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:56,075
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.

1018
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:59,656
Yes, I know, but how can
a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?

1019
01:10:00,782 --> 01:10:02,242
What was that?

1020
01:10:02,367 --> 01:10:04,995
My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.

1021
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,288
There is?

1022
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:09,792
Got it.

1023
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:14,088
Tangerine! Come on.
We've got to go.

1024
01:10:14,123 --> 01:10:16,298
Go on. Please go.

1025
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:21,512
You can run,
but you can't hide.

1026
01:10:22,096 --> 01:10:23,472
Clem, come on!

1027
01:10:24,473 --> 01:10:25,474
There I am.

1028
01:10:27,434 --> 01:10:29,415
That truck.

1029
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,397
Doc? Please!

1030
01:10:33,023 --> 01:10:37,778
Let's begin by
you telling me everything
you remember...

1031
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:41,991
That's strange.
He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1032
01:10:43,659 --> 01:10:46,996
At least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

1033
01:10:47,329 --> 01:10:48,546
Come on, Clem.

1034
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:51,375
He's developed
some sort of resistance
to the procedure.

1035
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:53,210
I don't want to run anymore.

1036
01:10:53,752 --> 01:10:54,753
Shit.

1037
01:10:56,338 --> 01:10:57,596
Come on.

1038
01:10:57,631 --> 01:11:00,050
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1039
01:11:00,085 --> 01:11:02,720
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.

1040
01:11:03,846 --> 01:11:04,937
Humiliation.

1041
01:11:04,972 --> 01:11:06,849
Come on, you big baby.

1042
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:16,442
No!

1043
01:11:17,776 --> 01:11:19,988
Bye, Howard.
Wait.

1044
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:22,908
He's disappeared again.

1045
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:24,534
Oh, dear.

1046
01:11:26,202 --> 01:11:27,704
I'm so sorry, Howard.

1047
01:11:28,246 --> 01:11:29,664
Humiliation.

1048
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:40,050
I don't like it, either.
I'm trying to find
horrible secret places to...

1049
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:42,052
Honey, I have a surprise.

1050
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:46,014
You know what?
I'll just ask you
in the morning.

1051
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:48,058
Good night.

1052
01:11:52,145 --> 01:11:54,314
I'm sorry.
Shut up.

1053
01:11:55,857 --> 01:11:57,067
Look.

1054
01:11:59,277 --> 01:12:02,280
Joel, look where we are.

1055
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:07,792
This isn't good.

1056
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:11,456
Then hide me somewhere
really buried.

1057
01:12:12,582 --> 01:12:14,674
Hit it, Joel!

1058
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:18,964
I can't,
I've got to go home.
I'll do it later!

1059
01:12:38,693 --> 01:12:40,493
He has a girlfriend.

1060
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:44,490
Wait, what am I doing?
Freddy, you don't
scare me anymore.

1061
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:49,996
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.

1062
01:12:50,031 --> 01:12:52,123
They're not worth it, Joel.

1063
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,251
He's not listening!
Come on.

1064
01:12:55,286 --> 01:12:56,669
Stupid!

1065
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:05,017
I'm so ashamed.

1066
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:09,640
It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Come on.

1067
01:13:09,849 --> 01:13:11,726
That's where I live, lived.

1068
01:13:11,976 --> 01:13:13,901
I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.

1069
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:16,397
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.

1070
01:13:16,432 --> 01:13:18,858
You can really kill me
this time. It's my turn. Go.

1071
01:13:18,893 --> 01:13:21,485
You're really going to die,
though, okay?

1072
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,837
One, two, three.

1073
01:13:22,872 --> 01:13:24,155
You're dead.

1074
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:27,116
My mom.

1075
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:30,536
It's okay, we're playing.
It's not real.

1076
01:13:30,571 --> 01:13:31,794
He's killing me.

1077
01:13:31,829 --> 01:13:34,832
Are you dead yet?
You're dead!

1078
01:13:36,334 --> 01:13:39,253
I think
I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it,

1079
01:13:39,288 --> 01:13:41,255
but I'm finding him
quickly enough.

1080
01:14:19,086 --> 01:14:20,545
Are you okay?

1081
01:14:24,633 --> 01:14:28,804
Oh, my God, that was terrible.
Almost three seconds.

1082
01:14:29,263 --> 01:14:30,562
Let's do it one more time.

1083
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:32,140
One more
and then I get to go.

1084
01:14:46,738 --> 01:14:48,031
This is so cool!

1085
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:49,866
Look out!

1086
01:14:53,954 --> 01:14:55,289
It's fluff.

1087
01:14:56,665 --> 01:14:58,083
Our house.

1088
01:15:03,339 --> 01:15:05,300
Wait, we've got to go.

1089
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,053
Come on.

1090
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:19,355
This is a really bad time
for this.

1091
01:15:21,524 --> 01:15:23,449
I don't even know
where we're going.

1092
01:15:23,484 --> 01:15:25,987
It's going to be fun.
It's the best place.

1093
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,823
No, this way.
This way. Come on.

1094
01:15:29,657 --> 01:15:31,534
You're no help at all.

1095
01:15:33,494 --> 01:15:34,704
Come on.

1096
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,165
Let go of me, Joel.

1097
01:15:50,553 --> 01:15:52,639
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1098
01:15:57,101 --> 01:16:01,356
I guess I'll go out
for some air,

1099
01:16:01,814 --> 01:16:03,233
if nobody minds.

1100
01:16:03,608 --> 01:16:06,986
It looks like
you have everything
under control here.

1101
01:16:07,278 --> 01:16:10,031
Yeah, that's fine.

1102
01:16:21,335 --> 01:16:23,462
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1103
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:26,798
What do you mean?

1104
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,550
Like famous quotes.

1105
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:31,852
I find reading them
inspirational,

1106
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:36,725
and in my reading,
I've come across some
I thought you might like, too.

1107
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:39,443
I'd love to hear some.

1108
01:16:39,478 --> 01:16:42,523
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful,

1109
01:16:42,558 --> 01:16:45,568
"for they get the better
even of their blunders."

1110
01:16:45,603 --> 01:16:47,409
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.

1111
01:16:47,444 --> 01:16:50,614
I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.

1112
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:53,784
No, it's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1113
01:16:55,578 --> 01:16:57,211
There's this
other one I like.

1114
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:58,956
It's by Pope Alexander
and it goes...

1115
01:16:59,707 --> 01:17:01,479
Alexander Pope?

1116
01:17:01,514 --> 01:17:03,252
Oh, yeah. Shit.

1117
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:07,047
It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander"

1118
01:17:07,082 --> 01:17:10,175
and sound like a dope,
and then I go ahead
and say it.

1119
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:13,095
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.

1120
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:19,226
The quote goes, "How happy
is the blameless vestal's lot!

1121
01:17:20,728 --> 01:17:23,522
"The world forgetting
by the world forgot

1122
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,067
"Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind!

1123
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:32,261
"Each pray'r accepted
and each wish resign'd"

1124
01:17:32,296 --> 01:17:36,411
I want to be a great,
big, huge elephant.

1125
01:17:37,412 --> 01:17:39,623
With a huge trunk like that.

1126
01:17:44,002 --> 01:17:46,588
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1127
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:49,633
I just thought
it would be appropriate,
maybe.

1128
01:17:54,638 --> 01:17:56,973
I really admire
the work you do.

1129
01:17:58,433 --> 01:18:00,602
I don't mean to be
so familiar...

1130
01:18:00,637 --> 01:18:02,771
It's fine.
I'm happy to hear...

1131
01:18:09,194 --> 01:18:10,570
I'm sorry.

1132
01:18:14,532 --> 01:18:17,077
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1133
01:18:19,871 --> 01:18:22,248
I shouldn't have said that.

1134
01:18:22,283 --> 01:18:24,626
Mary, you're
a wonderful girl.

1135
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:29,839
But, you know,
I have a wife and kids.

1136
01:18:35,595 --> 01:18:38,139
Mary, we can't do this.

1137
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,951
Good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1138
01:19:06,544 --> 01:19:08,629
What? Who is it?
Oh, my God.

1139
01:19:22,435 --> 01:19:24,520
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1140
01:19:29,942 --> 01:19:31,986
Hollis!

1141
01:19:35,448 --> 01:19:36,532
Wait.

1142
01:19:38,492 --> 01:19:40,001
I knew it, Howard.

1143
01:19:40,036 --> 01:19:42,496
It didn't start out like this.
I came here to work.

1144
01:19:42,531 --> 01:19:44,755
This is a one-time mistake.

1145
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:47,021
I'm a stupid girl
with a crush.

1146
01:19:47,056 --> 01:19:49,253
I basically
forced him into it.

1147
01:19:50,671 --> 01:19:53,090
Don't be a monster.
Tell the girl.

1148
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:57,720
Tell me what?

1149
01:19:58,304 --> 01:19:59,932
Oh, you poor kid.

1150
01:20:01,808 --> 01:20:04,895
You can have him.
You did.

1151
01:20:15,906 --> 01:20:16,990
What?

1152
01:20:27,292 --> 01:20:28,961
We have a history.

1153
01:20:31,004 --> 01:20:34,091
I'm sorry.
You wanted the procedure.

1154
01:20:36,093 --> 01:20:40,681
You wanted it done
so you could get past...

1155
01:20:48,355 --> 01:20:52,818
I have to
finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.

1156
01:20:54,987 --> 01:20:58,448
We'll talk later, okay?

1157
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:19,137
Let me give you a lift home.

1158
01:21:34,694 --> 01:21:38,156
Didn't figure you'd show
your face around me again.

1159
01:21:39,073 --> 01:21:42,035
I thought you were humiliated.

1160
01:21:42,243 --> 01:21:43,995
You did run away,
after all.

1161
01:21:44,662 --> 01:21:46,581
I just needed to see you.

1162
01:21:46,616 --> 01:21:47,665
Yeah?

1163
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:50,960
I'd like to

1164
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:53,838
take you out or something.

1165
01:21:55,214 --> 01:21:56,758
You're married.

1166
01:21:57,508 --> 01:21:59,719
Not yet. Not married.

1167
01:22:00,678 --> 01:22:02,388
No, I'm not married.

1168
01:22:02,555 --> 01:22:06,184
Look, I'm telling you
right off the bat,
I'm high maintenance,

1169
01:22:06,219 --> 01:22:09,246
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage

1170
01:22:09,281 --> 01:22:12,174
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1171
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:15,068
If you want to be with me,
you're with me.

1172
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:16,694
Okay.

1173
01:22:17,403 --> 01:22:20,907
Too many guys think
I'm a concept,
or I complete them

1174
01:22:20,942 --> 01:22:23,243
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1175
01:22:23,826 --> 01:22:27,455
I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

1176
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:28,881
Don't assign me yours.

1177
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:31,210
I remember that speech
really well.

1178
01:22:32,253 --> 01:22:33,844
I had you pegged,
didn't I?

1179
01:22:33,879 --> 01:22:35,839
Had the whole human race
pegged.

1180
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:37,841
Probably.

1181
01:22:39,843 --> 01:22:41,971
I still thought
you were going
to save my life.

1182
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,305
Even after that.

1183
01:22:45,558 --> 01:22:46,767
I know.

1184
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,689
It would be different,

1185
01:22:53,107 --> 01:22:55,734
if we could just
give it another go-round.

1186
01:22:59,405 --> 01:23:02,908
Remember me.
Try your best.

1187
01:23:06,453 --> 01:23:07,955
Maybe we can.

1188
01:23:39,778 --> 01:23:42,009
Just tell me
what you remember,

1189
01:23:42,044 --> 01:23:44,242
and we'll take it
from there.

1190
01:23:47,495 --> 01:23:49,581
I liked you immediately.

1191
01:23:50,457 --> 01:23:53,960
You didn't come on to me
at all. I liked that.

1192
01:23:56,463 --> 01:23:59,049
I was so tongue-tied
around you at first,

1193
01:23:59,084 --> 01:24:01,635
but I wanted you to think
I was smart.

1194
01:24:03,136 --> 01:24:05,312
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

1195
01:24:05,347 --> 01:24:09,851
I had these fantasies
of us being married
and having kids...

1196
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:14,356
Howie, I can't do this.

1197
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:17,359
We agreed
it's for the best, Mary.

1198
01:24:17,394 --> 01:24:18,652
Yeah, I know.

1199
01:24:20,612 --> 01:24:21,905
O£, God!

1200
01:24:22,364 --> 01:24:24,574
I'll take the bottom
and you...

1201
01:24:24,609 --> 01:24:26,785
No, Joel,
help me with that.

1202
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:27,959
Will you get the cooler?

1203
01:24:27,994 --> 01:24:29,746
Honey, the cooler's pretty...

1204
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:31,039
She can get it.

1205
01:24:31,873 --> 01:24:33,792
Let me get that.
No, no, no.

1206
01:24:33,827 --> 01:24:34,977
Don't take anything.

1207
01:24:35,012 --> 01:24:36,737
I can take the plane.

1208
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:38,463
Put the gate back up.

1209
01:24:41,716 --> 01:24:43,635
This is the day we met.

1210
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:47,389
You were by the surf.
I could just make you out
in the distance.

1211
01:24:47,424 --> 01:24:50,100
I remember being drawn to you,
even then.

1212
01:24:50,135 --> 01:24:52,244
I thought,
"Wow, how odd!

1213
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:54,354
"I'm drawn to someone's back."

1214
01:24:54,563 --> 01:24:56,738
You were
in that orange sweatshirt

1215
01:24:56,773 --> 01:25:00,361
that I would
come to know so well,
and even hate, eventually.

1216
01:25:00,903 --> 01:25:05,116
But at the time I thought,
"How cool,
an orange sweatshirt."

1217
01:25:05,151 --> 01:25:06,450
Hi, there.

1218
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:09,877
Hi.

1219
01:25:09,912 --> 01:25:13,624
I saw you sitting over here
by yourself,

1220
01:25:14,917 --> 01:25:17,587
and I thought,
"Thank God,

1221
01:25:17,753 --> 01:25:21,382
"someone normal who
doesn't know how to interact
at these things."

1222
01:25:22,925 --> 01:25:25,553
I don't ever know
what to say.

1223
01:25:26,178 --> 01:25:27,722
I'm Clementine.

1224
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,767
Can I borrow
a piece of your chicken?

1225
01:25:32,643 --> 01:25:35,855
And then you just took it,
without waiting for an answer.

1226
01:25:40,484 --> 01:25:44,238
It was so intimate,
like we were already lovers.

1227
01:25:46,866 --> 01:25:48,117
I'm Joel.

1228
01:25:49,201 --> 01:25:52,955
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.

1229
01:25:54,665 --> 01:25:55,715
You mean, like

1230
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,419
"Oh, my darlin', Clementine?"

1231
01:25:59,003 --> 01:26:01,547
Huckleberry Hound?
That sort of thing?

1232
01:26:01,582 --> 01:26:03,483
Yeah, like that.

1233
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:05,384
No, no jokes.

1234
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,929
One of my favorite things
when I was a kid

1235
01:26:07,964 --> 01:26:10,139
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1236
01:26:13,644 --> 01:26:15,812
I think your name is magical.

1237
01:26:18,815 --> 01:26:22,319
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.

1238
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,448
I know.

1239
01:26:27,866 --> 01:26:29,326
What do we do?

1240
01:26:32,329 --> 01:26:33,580
Enjoy it.

1241
01:26:51,223 --> 01:26:53,058
You married?
No.

1242
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:55,609
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1243
01:26:55,644 --> 01:26:58,146
I do sort of live
with someone, though.

1244
01:26:58,689 --> 01:27:00,691
Male or female?

1245
01:27:00,726 --> 01:27:02,693
What? Female.

1246
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:09,324
At least I'm not barking up
the wrong tree.

1247
01:27:12,536 --> 01:27:14,308
Do you know these people?

1248
01:27:14,343 --> 01:27:16,081
No, of course not.
Come on.

1249
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,043
They might have a dog.

1250
01:27:20,078 --> 01:27:21,378
There's no dog.

1251
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:25,131
What are you doing?

1252
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:26,884
It's freezing out.

1253
01:27:27,885 --> 01:27:29,679
I don't believe this.

1254
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,277
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1255
01:27:45,737 --> 01:27:48,448
Nobody's coming here tonight,
believe me.

1256
01:27:52,952 --> 01:27:56,623
So, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1257
01:27:57,790 --> 01:28:00,168
Naomi,
but we're not really...

1258
01:28:01,419 --> 01:28:04,304
Whatever.
So this is great.

1259
01:28:04,339 --> 01:28:09,218
Now I can look
for candles, matches,
and the liquor cabinet.

1260
01:28:09,427 --> 01:28:10,637
Oh, God.

1261
01:28:17,644 --> 01:28:19,124
I think we should go.

1262
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:20,605
There's no phone line.

1263
01:28:21,064 --> 01:28:22,906
What?
I think we should go.

1264
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:26,736
Why? It's our house.
Just for tonight.

1265
01:28:26,771 --> 01:28:29,864
We are
David and Ruth Laskin.

1266
01:28:31,282 --> 01:28:33,076
Which one do you want to be?

1267
01:28:33,284 --> 01:28:36,371
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1268
01:28:38,706 --> 01:28:40,124
What do you need?

1269
01:28:41,961 --> 01:28:43,087
Alcohol.

1270
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:46,715
So, are you okay with wine?

1271
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:47,890
I don't know.

1272
01:28:47,925 --> 01:28:49,600
Well, you choose the wine.

1273
01:28:49,635 --> 01:28:53,597
I'll go find the bedroom
and slip into
something more Ruth.

1274
01:28:57,101 --> 01:29:00,020
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
We really should go.

1275
01:29:02,314 --> 01:29:04,358
I've got to catch my ride.

1276
01:29:06,527 --> 01:29:07,987
So go.

1277
01:29:09,071 --> 01:29:12,992
I did. I thought
maybe you were a nut.

1278
01:29:14,368 --> 01:29:16,078
But you were exciting.

1279
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:20,130
I wish you'd stayed.

1280
01:29:20,165 --> 01:29:23,168
I wish I'd stayed, too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1281
01:29:23,203 --> 01:29:25,504
I wish I'd done
a lot of things.

1282
01:29:32,595 --> 01:29:35,347
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1283
01:29:35,514 --> 01:29:38,100
I came back downstairs
and you were gone.

1284
01:29:38,135 --> 01:29:40,901
I walked out the door.
Why?

1285
01:29:40,936 --> 01:29:44,023
I don't know. I felt
like a scared little kid.

1286
01:29:44,648 --> 01:29:46,400
It was above my head.

1287
01:29:47,192 --> 01:29:49,153
You were scared?
Yeah.

1288
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:53,866
I thought
you knew that about me.

1289
01:29:54,491 --> 01:29:58,121
I ran back
to the bonfire, trying
to outrun my humiliation.

1290
01:29:59,205 --> 01:30:01,875
Was it something I said?
Yeah.

1291
01:30:04,753 --> 01:30:08,548
You said "So go"
with such disdain.

1292
01:30:09,883 --> 01:30:11,280
I'm sorry.

1293
01:30:11,315 --> 01:30:12,677
It's okay.

1294
01:30:20,894 --> 01:30:23,104
What if you stayed this time?

1295
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:27,067
I walked out the door.

1296
01:30:28,735 --> 01:30:29,694
There's no memory left.

1297
01:30:30,278 --> 01:30:32,364
Come back
and make up a goodbye.

1298
01:30:33,573 --> 01:30:34,950
Let's pretend
we had one.

1299
01:30:46,544 --> 01:30:47,879
Bye, Joel.

1300
01:30:49,381 --> 01:30:50,757
I love you.

1301
01:30:51,341 --> 01:30:54,594
Meet me in Montauk.

1302
01:30:59,349 --> 01:31:02,269
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.

1303
01:31:03,812 --> 01:31:07,816
You were operating
the plane with the remote
control, and it crashed.

1304
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:09,898
It was fucking windy.
Come on.

1305
01:31:09,934 --> 01:31:11,911
You're stoned
and you're driving.

1306
01:31:11,946 --> 01:31:15,449
The pot balances it out
and brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.

1307
01:31:15,484 --> 01:31:18,251
If I'm going to be drinking,
then I'll smoke it.

1308
01:31:18,286 --> 01:31:23,249
It does. A medical test
was done. It's proven
on the Science Network.

1309
01:31:23,284 --> 01:31:25,001
Honey, just watch the road.

1310
01:31:25,036 --> 01:31:26,335
I can't see shit.

1311
01:31:28,296 --> 01:31:31,215
I saw you talking
to a pretty girl.

1312
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,348
She was nice.

1313
01:31:32,383 --> 01:31:34,260
Yeah, man, who was it?

1314
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:39,557
She was just a girl.

1315
01:31:47,481 --> 01:31:48,566
Okay.

1316
01:32:25,687 --> 01:32:28,106
So I've got to
drop the van off.

1317
01:32:28,357 --> 01:32:31,318
Thanks, Stan. We'll talk.

1318
01:33:58,239 --> 01:33:59,574
You've got all your stuff,
I see.

1319
01:33:59,609 --> 01:34:00,665
That's right.

1320
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,577
I take it
you're not coming back.

1321
01:34:02,994 --> 01:34:05,142
I wouldn't come back
if I was you.

1322
01:34:05,177 --> 01:34:07,290
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.

1323
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:10,293
So you didn't do
the erasing?

1324
01:34:10,328 --> 01:34:12,010
Of course not. God, no.

1325
01:34:12,045 --> 01:34:14,672
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1326
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:16,758
Once, maybe.

1327
01:34:18,801 --> 01:34:22,013
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car,

1328
01:34:22,221 --> 01:34:24,265
and I saw you two talking.

1329
01:34:24,807 --> 01:34:27,268
So I waved to you,
and you giggled.

1330
01:34:28,019 --> 01:34:29,562
How did I look?

1331
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:33,483
You looked happy.

1332
01:34:33,983 --> 01:34:36,527
Happy with a secret.

1333
01:34:37,946 --> 01:34:39,454
And after that?

1334
01:34:39,489 --> 01:34:42,471
I never saw you two together
again like that,

1335
01:34:42,506 --> 01:34:45,453
so I just figured
I was imagining things.

1336
01:35:11,689 --> 01:35:15,985
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?

1337
01:35:27,538 --> 01:35:28,747
Thanks.

1338
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:05,701
Let me get my toothbrush.

1339
01:36:20,592 --> 01:36:23,560
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.

1340
01:36:23,595 --> 01:36:27,098
I feel like you're mad at me
and I don't know what I did.

1341
01:36:28,308 --> 01:36:29,900
What did I do?

1342
01:36:29,935 --> 01:36:33,897
I love you so much.
I'll do anything
to make you happy.

1343
01:36:34,606 --> 01:36:37,901
Just tell me what you want
me to do, and I'll do it.

1344
01:36:38,151 --> 01:36:41,947
I'm going to stop by
this morning,
just to make sure you're okay.

1345
01:36:54,376 --> 01:36:56,002
Let's go, mister.

1346
01:36:57,504 --> 01:37:00,048
I had a really nice time
last night.

1347
01:37:01,216 --> 01:37:02,300
Nice?

1348
01:37:02,509 --> 01:37:07,097
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life
last night.

1349
01:37:07,472 --> 01:37:08,974
That's better.

1350
01:37:13,186 --> 01:37:14,528
This is weird.

1351
01:37:14,563 --> 01:37:17,107
"To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.

1352
01:37:17,142 --> 01:37:18,490
"My name is Mary Svevo.

1353
01:37:18,525 --> 01:37:20,659
"We've met,
but you don't remember me.

1354
01:37:20,694 --> 01:37:25,408
"I worked for a company
you hired to have
part of your memory erased.

1355
01:37:25,443 --> 01:37:28,292
"I've since decided
that this is a horrible...

1356
01:37:28,327 --> 01:37:32,081
"To correct this, I'm sending
everyone's file back to them."

1357
01:37:33,874 --> 01:37:36,252
My name
is Clementine Kruczynski.

1358
01:37:36,544 --> 01:37:39,171
I'm here to erase
Joel Barish.

1359
01:37:39,714 --> 01:37:42,008
What is this?
I don't know.

1360
01:37:42,043 --> 01:37:43,182
He's boring.

1361
01:37:43,217 --> 01:37:46,012
Is that enough reason
to erase someone?

1362
01:37:46,387 --> 01:37:50,850
I've been thinking how I was
before and how I am now,
and he changed me.

1363
01:37:50,885 --> 01:37:52,775
I feel like
I'm always pissy now.

1364
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:56,063
I don't like myself
when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.

1365
01:37:56,098 --> 01:37:57,989
I can't stand
to even look at him.

1366
01:37:58,024 --> 01:38:00,693
That pathetic, wimpy,
apologetic smile.

1367
01:38:00,728 --> 01:38:02,702
That sort of
wounded puppy shit.

1368
01:38:02,737 --> 01:38:04,829
What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.

1369
01:38:04,864 --> 01:38:07,074
The bloom is certainly
off the rose at this point.

1370
01:38:07,109 --> 01:38:09,368
Are you screwing with me?
No!

1371
01:38:09,535 --> 01:38:12,204
You are screwing with me.
Joel, I'm not!

1372
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:13,789
You clearly are!

1373
01:38:14,123 --> 01:38:16,667
Let's just take a minute
and...

1374
01:38:45,614 --> 01:38:48,784
Patrick,
get the fuck away from me!

1375
01:38:49,785 --> 01:38:52,537
Can we talk about it?
No, get the fuck away!

1376
01:39:27,281 --> 01:39:31,034
Hey, Clementine.
Nice to see you.

1377
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:41,962
I mean,
she's smart, I think,
but not educated.

1378
01:39:42,504 --> 01:39:45,007
I couldn't talk to her
about books.

1379
01:39:45,132 --> 01:39:47,759
She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.

1380
01:39:48,468 --> 01:39:51,514
Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.

1381
01:39:51,973 --> 01:39:54,566
The truth is,
I was embarrassed in public,

1382
01:39:54,601 --> 01:39:58,229
Hi.
Because she would pronounce
"library," "li-berry."

1383
01:40:03,526 --> 01:40:04,909
Look what I found.

1384
01:40:04,944 --> 01:40:08,823
I think if there's
a truly seductive quality
about Clementine,

1385
01:40:08,858 --> 01:40:12,702
it's that her personality
promises to take you
out of the mundane.

1386
01:40:14,495 --> 01:40:16,713
Made me look skinny.

1387
01:40:16,748 --> 01:40:20,585
An amazing, burning meteorite
will carry you
to another world

1388
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:22,503
where things are exciting.

1389
01:40:24,881 --> 01:40:29,093
But what you quickly learn
is that it's really
an elaborate ruse.

1390
01:40:29,719 --> 01:40:31,763
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1391
01:40:33,056 --> 01:40:34,390
It's okay.

1392
01:40:39,354 --> 01:40:42,690
I really like you.
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1393
01:40:42,725 --> 01:40:44,734
Let me turn this off, okay?

1394
01:40:45,568 --> 01:40:47,320
That's only fair.

1395
01:40:50,698 --> 01:40:54,035
The whole thing
with the hair,
it's all bullshit.

1396
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,412
I really like your hair.

1397
01:40:56,447 --> 01:40:57,622
Thank you.

1398
01:40:58,081 --> 01:40:59,290
I do.

1399
01:41:02,669 --> 01:41:04,587
You want a drink or something?

1400
01:41:04,622 --> 01:41:06,215
Do you have any whiskey?

1401
01:41:07,841 --> 01:41:12,554
I didn't think
her sex was motivated.

1402
01:41:12,888 --> 01:41:16,892
I saw it clearly
the last night we were
together. It wasn't sexy.

1403
01:41:16,927 --> 01:41:19,353
It was just sad.

1404
01:41:20,563 --> 01:41:22,690
Sorry,
I thought there was more.

1405
01:41:22,815 --> 01:41:26,193
The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her

1406
01:41:26,228 --> 01:41:27,861
is to fuck them.

1407
01:41:29,071 --> 01:41:33,075
Or at least dangle
the possibility of getting
fucked in front of them.

1408
01:41:33,110 --> 01:41:36,537
I think she's
so desperate and insecure

1409
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:40,874
that she'll sooner or later
go around fucking everybody.

1410
01:41:40,909 --> 01:41:42,049
I don't do that.

1411
01:41:42,084 --> 01:41:44,503
I wouldn't
think that about you.

1412
01:41:44,712 --> 01:41:46,714
Because I don't.
I know.

1413
01:41:46,964 --> 01:41:49,925
It hurts me
that you said that,
because I don't do that.

1414
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,758
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.

1415
01:41:52,793 --> 01:41:55,551
I'm going to go.
I'm a little confused.

1416
01:41:55,586 --> 01:41:58,309
I don't really think
I can be here.

1417
01:42:05,274 --> 01:42:06,233
Bye.

1418
01:42:06,942 --> 01:42:09,048
I really thought
I knew her so well.

1419
01:42:09,083 --> 01:42:11,155
It was nice meeting you
and all.

1420
01:42:13,991 --> 01:42:17,411
What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,

1421
01:42:17,446 --> 01:42:20,040
only to find out
that she's a stranger.

1422
01:42:24,961 --> 01:42:26,046
Wait.

1423
01:42:29,007 --> 01:42:31,266
What?
I don't know. Just wait.

1424
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:36,056
What do you want, Joel?
I want you to wait
for a while.

1425
01:42:50,654 --> 01:42:52,614
Okay.
Really?

1426
01:42:53,448 --> 01:42:57,452
I'm not a concept,
just a fucked-up girl
looking for my peace of mind.

1427
01:42:57,487 --> 01:42:59,002
I'm not perfect.

1428
01:42:59,037 --> 01:43:01,581
I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

1429
01:43:01,616 --> 01:43:03,959
But you will.
Right now I can't.

1430
01:43:04,417 --> 01:43:06,134
You will think of things.

1431
01:43:06,169 --> 01:43:08,129
And I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped,

1432
01:43:08,164 --> 01:43:10,507
because that's what happens
with me.

1433
01:43:12,008 --> 01:43:13,093
Okay.

1434
01:43:17,597 --> 01:43:18,682
Okay.

1435
01:43:23,395 --> 01:43:24,521
Okay.
