1
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,757
My job takes me to a lot of places.

2
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,294
It's got its down sides.

3
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,495
I sleep alone. I eat alone.

4
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,007
I'm used to it,
though.

5
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,137
I'd like to meet someone.

6
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,339
But it's tough when you live
out of a suitcase.

7
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:26,150
I go where I'm told...
do what I'm told.

8
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,922
I shouldn't complain.
The work is steady.

9
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:34,292
The money's good,
but it's not for everyone.

10
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,048
My name's Joe.

11
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,591
This is what I do.

12
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,744
You're late.

13
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,676
Sorry, Mr. London.
They closed Chechov bridge.

14
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,218
You're leaving?

15
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,522
I need the phone.

16
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,576
I can help with the bags.

17
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,441
No, I can handle it.

18
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,581
If you ever come back,
I can, I can use the money.

19
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,024
Thank you.

20
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,885
Goodbye.

21
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,442
I was taught four rules...

22
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,618
One, "Don't ask questions".

23
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,078
There is no such thing
as right and wrong.

24
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,792
Two, " don't take an interest in people
outside of work".

25
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,360
There is no such thing as trust.

26
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,827
Three, "Erase every trace".

27
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,231
Come anonymous
and leave nothing behind.

28
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,500
Four, "Know when to get out".

29
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,603
Just thinking about it.
Means it's time

30
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:57,013
before you lose your edge,
before you become a target.

31
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,093
So you look for the right opportunity.

32
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,328
Nothing too risky.

33
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,671
Get the money
and disappear forever.

34
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,073
This is it.

35
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,571
Four hits, one location.

36
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,115
The lastjob.

37
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,745
Purpose of your visit to Bangkok,
Mr. Vincent?

38
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:37,981
Holiday.

39
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,160
Bangkok.

40
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,727
It's corrupt,
dirty and dense.

41
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,165
All my clients have one thing
in common.

42
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,504
They feed off the people.

43
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,565
There's big money in misery.

44
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,302
Where there's money,
there's competition.

45
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,209
and the guy paying me
usually wins.

46
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,981
How will we know when he's arrived?

47
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,020
We'll know when he arranges the pick-up.

48
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,627
You're sure he's reliable?

49
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,955
The Russians swear by him.

50
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,534
How do you swear by...

51
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,165
a man you've never met?

52
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,845
We don't know him. He doesn't know us.

53
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,046
It's better for us that way.

54
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,679
It always starts the same way.

55
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,017
Just like I was taught.

56
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,589
Secure a safe location.

57
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,796
Somewhere off the beaten path
where you have privacy.

58
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:30,265
But you stay invisible too long, the human race
starts to look like another species,

59
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,733
so you venture out, you observe,

60
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,506
and then you return to
your invisible world,

61
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,842
like a ghost.

62
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,424
Hey, Larry Check out the pussy here.

63
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,899
- Check out these girls.
- Hey, girls, what's up?

64
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,400
Hello, gentlemen, ah.
How are you?

65
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,766
- First time in Bangkok?
- Yeah.

66
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,034
Rolex? Good one if you want. Yeah, yeah,
Look. Good. Rolex.

67
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,598
Watch out, Larry. How much you want
to bet it's counterfeit.

68
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,538
Two thousand Baht only. Two thousand.
It looks good. Good.

69
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,580
- No. thanks. No, thanks.
- No, no. No Rolex?

70
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,512
Never mind. Never mind.
You want girls?

71
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,311
- I can get you girls.
- No.

72
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,851
No girls?
How about boys?

73
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,146
- You like boys?
- Nooo!

74
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,483
- You don't like boys, no?
- No. Hey,

75
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,490
Hey, how about you,
huh, cowboy?

76
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,389
Five thousand Baht, new car
smell satisfaction money back.

77
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,554
Super-rubber-pussy-guarantee, huh?

78
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,030
Whatever happens in Bangkok
stays in Bangkok.

79
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,828
You wanna find garbage?
Go to a garbage dump.

80
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,062
I look for three qualifications.

81
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,405
They have to speak a little English,
they have to want to make money,

82
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,970
and, above all they have
to be disposable.

83
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,449
Do you wanna make some money?

84
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,876
I have work in town.
I need some help.

85
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,521
What work?

86
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,050
Pick things up,
drop things off.

87
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,693
Maybe some translation.

88
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,724
About a month's work.
Two thousand a day.

89
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,304
- Dollars.
- Baht.

90
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,170
Bullshit. Huh.

91
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,214
Five thousand, huh?
Forty five hundred.

92
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,044
Four thousand.

93
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,123
Two thousand, nine hundred
and fifty-two fifty, heh?

94
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,784
What you, what you say?
Come on!

95
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,991
We'll round up.
Three thousand.

96
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,991
You get paid at the end of the week.

97
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,388
No deal.

98
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:40,933
Ah, oh, okay, okay.

99
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:44,232
How about half, half now,
half at end of the week.

100
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,401
What's your name?

101
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,765
Kong.

102
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,402
Kong?

103
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,508
You can keep that in the wallet
you stole.

104
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,285
You come alone,
or you don't get paid.

105
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,026
Yes boss.

106
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,026
- Take off the shades.
- Huh?

107
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,466
Glasses. Off.

108
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,204
Keep that with you at all times.

109
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,314
- I have good phone.
- Now you have two.

110
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,714
You answer whenever it rings.

111
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,084
If I call and you don't answer,
you don't get paid.

112
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,326
Time is very important.

113
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,425
If I tell you to be somewhere

114
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,999
and you are a minute late...

115
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,831
you don't get paid.

116
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,904
Do you understand?

117
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,273
Birdshit foreigner

118
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,471
- In English.
- I understand!

119
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,405
You know the Caribbean club?

120
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,118
High class ass.

121
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,679
Ask for a dancer named Aom.
You give her this.

122
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,347
You make sure the X is
facing up like this.

123
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,289
She's gonna give you a package.

124
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,489
Don't open it.

125
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,560
What's in it?

126
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,424
It doesn't concern you.

127
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,359
Then you go pick it up.

128
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,702
I'll find someone else.

129
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,136
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
I, I do it. I do it. I do it.

130
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,935
You come straight back here.

131
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,068
You don't stop for anything.

132
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,835
What if I have to piss?

133
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,043
If you ask me one more question...

134
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,985
Then I won't get paid.
I know that.

135
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,989
- Okay, I go now, ah?
- Hey!

136
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,694
Take the cell phone.

137
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,098
Duck fucker.

138
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,175
Excuse me.
Which dancer is Aom?

139
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,102
That one right there.

140
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:17,909
Thank you very much.

141
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,885
What do you want?

142
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,659
Fuck a Duck!

143
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,586
- You late, huh?
- Gimme the case.

144
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,129
You don't get paid for today.

145
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,289
- Why not?
- You ran from the police.

146
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,858
You told me not to stop.
I, I do what you said.

147
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,130
Don't stop, no stop for nothing,
not even for piss!

148
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,139
From now on,
I don't want anymore police.

149
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,339
You understand?

150
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:04,008
The human face can mislead
in a thousand different ways.

151
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,582
But the eyes never change.

152
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,088
I was taught to start with the eyes.

153
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,290
I'm Kong.

154
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,707
Heroin?

155
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,381
Give him what he needs.

156
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,828
No, wait, wait, wait.

157
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,306
The elephant.

158
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,240
The ah, the nose, you see?

159
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,646
Pointing down... bad luck.
No good.

160
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,948
Bad luck for you.

161
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,517
Goodnight.

162
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,163
Yeah, I'm checking on
a wire transfer.

163
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:30,201
Account code
six-five-one, four-three, four-six.

164
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,780
Thank you.

165
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,310
Hello...

166
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,014
Uh... I have a a cut...

167
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,918

168
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,057
disinfectant...

169
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,229
Do you speak English?

170
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,535
How many?

171
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,609
Eh, one.

172
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,681
In, oh, in the morning?
In the morning.

173
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,253
One...

174
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,929
Bef? before bed.

175
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,439
Two hundred and fifty Bath, sir.

176
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,919
Thank you.

177
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,428
Oh, I have it.

178
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,984
Excuse me.

179
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,258
How much are these?

180
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,455
Those are 20,000 Bath.

181
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,732
20,000?

182
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,411
I really love it

183
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,702
Where's my money damn it?

184
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:56,725
You're late.

185
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,161
I'm sorry, boss.

186
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,396
Don't be sorry.
Be on time.

187
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,038
What happened to your face?

188
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,844
Some ass holes tried,
tried to mug me.

189
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,080
Like twenty of them.

190
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,380
But I kicked their asses.

191
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,220
I'm so sorry, boss.

192
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,017
So sorry.

193
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,753
They... they take...

194
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,831
It's been opened.

195
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,560
Not me. It's them.
They broke it.

196
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,934
But I wouldn't let them have it.
I got it back for you.

197
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,637
I don't let them have it.

198
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,512
There's a beer in the refrigerator.

199
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,140
It'll take down the swelling.

200
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,178
Yes, boss.

201
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,687
He's a bad man.

202
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,284
Who?

203
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,324
The man in the case.

204
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,029
You're going to kill him?

205
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,305
Can you teach me?

206
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,535
- Teach you what?
- Everything.

207
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,173
I could help you.

208
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,351
Please?

209
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,894
Show, show me.

210
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,470
Again.

211
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:17,737
Again.

212
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,142
Again.

213
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,610
Again.

214
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,147
Again.

215
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:35,925
Again.

216
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,597
Good.

217
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,948
That was your first lesson.

218
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,983
Why didn't I kill him?

219
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,827
Maybe it's because,

220
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,859
and this is strange,

221
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,766
somehow,
when I looked into his eyes,

222
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,297
I saw myself,

223
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,307
so I became his teacher.

224
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:29,275
The best way to defend yourself is to know
when something's about to happen.

225
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,773
So, you have to learn
to read your surroundings.

226
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,981
See that man in the red jacket?

227
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,414
What man?

228
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,431
You're living in a city of mirrors.

229
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:55,404
Store windows, glass office buildings,
polished steel,

230
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,802
eyes in the back of your head.

231
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,079
Aaah!

232
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,985
Eyes in the back of my head, huh,
boss, huh?

233
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,141
I got you now, boss.

234
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,686
I'm not your boss.
I'm your teacher.

235
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,482
So I call you

236
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,367
How is he bad?

237
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,041
This man?

238
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,271
He hurts many country girls.

239
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,911
From the north
He buys them from their parents?

240
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,282
Same thing like devil,
ah, this guy.

241
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,019
SHERATON HOTEL
ACCIDENTAL DEATH

242
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:04,284
leader Pramod Juntasa was found dead
in his pool last night.

243
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,990
Mother fucker,
he got what he deserved.

244
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,703
How many people have you killed?

245
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,547
I don't think about that.

246
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,919
Do the police know who you are?

247
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:43,216
No one knows who I am.
No one knows where I am.

248
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,687
I know.

249
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,234
- How many jobs in Bangkok?
- Four.

250
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,809
Four. Two left.

251
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,958
Um, I...

252
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,663
Can you, can you help me?

253
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,829
Could you tell her that I wanna
take her to dinner?

254
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,760
Oh! Right.

255
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,181
It's ah... hot.

256
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,936
Tom Yam Kung

257
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,172
That's just...

258
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,317
Just eat it?

259
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,328
It's cooling it down.

260
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,610
It's hot again.
It's really hot.

261
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,325
Ha, the whole thing.

262
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,563
Yeah, that's better.

263
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,124
Oooh!

264
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:05,617
Now, you don't pull the trigger.
You squeeze it.

265
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,292
- It's yours.
- Oh!

266
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,702
Congratulations.

267
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,179
It's best if he doesn't know us.

268
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,960
But we should know more about him.

269
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,921
Where? Where?

270
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:02,624
Okay...

271
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,897
- Boss?
- Yeah.

272
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:41,262
I just left the club.
I think somebody's following me.

273
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,532
Be at the Chao Praya ferry station
in twenty minutes.

274
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,608
Okay, boss.

275
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,770
- Wait for my call.
- Done, boss.

276
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,709
Okay, listen carefully.

277
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,653
Open the case.
Sixty-five, thirty-two, fifteen.

278
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,156
You put the cell phone in the case,
and leave it.

279
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,055
Got it.

280
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,773
I found it first. Let go.

281
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,976
- Give it to me.
- Let go. I found it first.

282
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,922
I found it first.

283
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,132
The case has returned.

284
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:13,959
Yes.

285
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,459
Put your boss on.

286
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,039
Yes.

287
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,679
We had an arrangement.

288
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:33,479
If I see your people again,
I'll kill your wife.

289
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:43,685
We'll try again.

290
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,799
Thank you.

291
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,308
Ah, you, what, what is your work?

292
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:36,435
Oh... Ah... Ah, Banking.

293
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,317
Bank. Banker?

294
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,779
- Bank, banker, yes.
- Banker?

295
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,188
He said he's a banker

296
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:54,821
Rain.

297
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:01,891
Rain.

298
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:08,229
Is you?
Your, your name means rain?

299
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,866
This is your name.

300
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,832
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

301
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,274
Floating Market?

302
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,069
Where's Damnoen Saduak?

303
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:00,273
Ratchaburi Province.
Hour and a half by car.

304
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:07,850
Get some sleep.

305
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,587
We leave early.

306
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,015
Dock the boat up on the right.

307
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,877
Hey, Mr... You buy something?

308
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,690
Get us out of here!

309
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,021
Get us out!

310
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,203
Dock the boat on the left.

311
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,040
Come on. Faster. Hurry up!

312
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,722
Get me over there!

313
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,566
Fuck!

314
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,808
Take it to the club.

315
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:41,979
He's same like you, you know?

316
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,909
- Who?
- This guy, in TV.

317
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,958
He fight bad guys and helps the poor.

318
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,125
Thai people love him.

319
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,489
He's a very good man.

320
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,870
Samle like you.

321
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,046
FIFTY COINS - FIFTY WISHES

322
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:46,326
I am happy together with you.

323
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:35,904
Four Know when it's time to get out.

324
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:47,976
Three. Erase every trace.

325
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:52,984
Boss?

326
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:59,723
Two... Don't take an interest
in people outside of work.

327
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,208
One... Don't ask questions.

328
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,476
He's a very good man.

329
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:24,610
Same like you...

330
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,938
Political assassination wasn't in the contract.

331
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,207
So, there are two ways to go.

332
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,540
Refuse the job and walk away now,

333
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,949
or, do the job and walk away rich.

334
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,819
The truth is almost anyone one can take out a politician.

335
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,954
That's not the hard part.

336
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:43,159
The hard part is getting away with it.

337
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:56,377
He wants more money.

338
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:05,912
It's a big job. There's risk.

339
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,517
Yes. He knows who we are.

340
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,120
If he were caught,

341
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,123
it could lead back to us.

342
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:22,126
What about the messenger?

343
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:25,664
We should erase every link.

344
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:27,743
The girl too.

345
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,143
Just to be safe.

346
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,346
I'll take care of it.

347
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,553
- I'd better go.
- He can wait.

348
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,691
He's counting on me.

349
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:24,733
Kong!

350
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,265
Be here tomorrow at six P.M.

351
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,341
Last job?

352
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:37,143
Yeah.

353
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:39,677
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

354
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,411
See you tomorrow, boss.

355
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,715
Call him. Or we do to your sister...

356
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:21,853
what we did to you.

357
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,460
Call.

358
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:48,813
Aom!

359
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,029
Kong!

360
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:16,838
Where is he staying?

361
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,386
Aom!

362
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:37,725
Tell me where he is staying.

363
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,993
Or I'll cut her tits off.

364
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,759
He fight bad guys and help the poor.

365
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:28,897
Thai people love him

366
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:41,960
When the nightmare becomes real,
you don't hesitate.

367
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:44,692
You don't think
You just run.

368
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,160
Anyone in the way goes down.

369
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:50,138
It's pretty simple.
You are the target now.

370
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:52,698
Leave the country,
or you are going to die.

371
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:33,138
Where is Kong?

372
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:35,737
Where is Kong?

373
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:37,871
Why the fuck you care?

374
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:40,808
He's my student.

375
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:46,949
Where is Kong?

376
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,952
Surat.

377
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,621
He's with Surat.

378
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:59,290
...exactly which direction everybody's running
doesn't seem to be running away

379
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:04,433
Still no answer.

380
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,835
Maybe he killed them.

381
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,975
He's only one man.

382
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:49,810
This is taking too long. When will he show up.

383
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:18,833
There he is!

384
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:21,439
Let's go.

385
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:36,849
What's that noise?

386
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:48,869
Where is he? Do you see him?
I can't see anything.

387
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:11,857
Kong, where is he?

388
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:51,495
I had to tell them.

389
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:01,307
Take her to the street.

390
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:03,366
I cleared the way.

391
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,378
I got one more job.

392
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:06,971
Surat?

393
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,307
He's very bad.

394
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:24,994
Don't wait. Just go.

395
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:32,391
Shoot him.

396
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:34,660
Shoot him.

397
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:52,818
Get off!
Go and fight!

398
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:54,011
Shoot him!

399
01:35:54,012 --> 01:35:55,012
