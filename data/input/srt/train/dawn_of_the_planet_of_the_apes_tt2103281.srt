1
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,430
It is a sign of what was done to the
city.

2
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,060
CDC provides the mortality reached
between 5,000,000.

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,600
Could reach up to 250 m within 6
months ahead.

4
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,660
Any person showing signs of
contagion.

5
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,030
Receive special treatment right here
in quarantine.

6
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,140
Many new ones are children without
parents.

7
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,910
Quarantine raises riots.

8
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,160
Families are torn.

9
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,280
We are not ready for mass
evacuations.

10
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,940
Survival is now 1 in 500.

11
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,680
Violent incidents in the city center
tonight.

12
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,290
20 people including U.
S.

13
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,360
We lost energy sources.

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,770
An influenza virus of simian origin.

15
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,720
All government services ceased until
further notice.

16
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,010
Those who did not die of the virus.

17
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,150
Probably die fighting.

18
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,940
Maybe this is the end.

19
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,940
Soon.

20
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,290
There will be no one.

21
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:35,270
Planet of the Apes: confrontation.

22
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,210
Caesar.

23
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,120
They arrive.

24
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,440
Koba!

25
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,850
Now, father?

26
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,880
Wait, son.

27
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,730
Thank you, Koba.

28
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,850
Think before acting, son.

29
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,120
Do not worry, eyes-blue.

30
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,070
Your scars make you strong.

31
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,440
Come see your little brother.

32
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,750
Another son.

33
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,460
I realize that we have experienced
so much.

34
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,250
It seems so far.

35
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,240
You still think back to them?

36
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,950
Men?

37
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,240
Sometimes.

38
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,010
I have not known you as.

39
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,760
I have not seen the worst.

40
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,010
Good or bad, it is finished.

41
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,910
They were killing.

42
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,850
Primates also fight.

43
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,980
But we are a family.

44
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,210
They are all gone, you think?

45
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,260
It's 10 winters.

46
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,960
The last 2, no trace of them.

47
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,780
They are gone, then.

48
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,490
Not you have me eyes-blue.
I'm fast.

49
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,980
Shut up, ash!

50
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,210
Nothing to fear.

51
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Primate!
Help!

52
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,110
Help!

53
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,990
Fast!

54
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,280
Primate!

55
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,040
Here!

56
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,490
I touched it!
I touched it!

57
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,880
He shot my son, ash!

58
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,260
Rocket, wait!

59
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,410
We do not want to hurt you.

60
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,720
You really think he understand.

61
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,310
Yet it looks like.

62
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,290
I beg.
- It's good.

63
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,550
Let down your arms.

64
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,030
You laugh!
I need regular.
- Do.

65
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,950
Go!

66
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,660
Oh, shit!

67
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,570
Understood?
- Ok.

68
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,930
Ok, we're going?

69
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,110
Go!

70
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,600
Koba!

71
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,180
Follow them!

72
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,200
You found?

73
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,520
Need to talk.

74
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,190
What?
What up?

75
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,190
The.

76
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,490
The dam is good, you can restart in
a week.

77
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,990
But there's a problem, gabe.

78
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,920
We were frightened, not knowing what
to do.

79
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,050
My god, how y '?

80
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,650
Many, perhaps 80.
- Much more.

81
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,500
You do not understand what he says?

82
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,320
They spoke!
- Not.

83
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
I swear it was amazing.

84
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,060
Amazing?
Primates speaking with enormous
spears

85
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,010
You believed see or hear something,
I understand.

86
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,010
But calm down now.

87
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,300
And the virus?

88
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,960
There are risks of contagion?
- The survivors are immune I think.

89
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,540
She worked for the CDC, she knows.
- What do we do?

90
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,540
I do not know.

91
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,230
One needs electricity.
- It would have killed us.

92
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,790
Maybe he has spared us for us to
follow.

93
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,140
He spots us and kill us all!

94
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,680
That it?
- It tells me that there was a
leader, be a singular.

95
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,310
A remarkable person!
- Really?

96
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,790
That's what you saw?
- Yes, we all saw.

97
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,720
Not breathe a word to anyone until
we have a plane.

98
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,540
This is a joke.
- It is very serious.

99
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,200
Is not answered panic.

100
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,380
Then you okay?
- I'm fine.

101
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,470
I dropped my bag.
- I know.

102
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,650
Your sketches were in?
- All lost.

103
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,980
We can not talk to anyone about what
happened up there.

104
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,720
They will soon enough.

105
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,470
Tackle them quickly!

106
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,470
Before they attack us!
.

107
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,160
We do not know that there are many.

108
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,930
How they have guns?

109
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,490
Why they come here?

110
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,110
They shot your son, rocket!

111
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,180
You gonna fight?

112
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
I will follow Caesar.

113
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,690
Koba's right!

114
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,800
They nearly kill you, ash.

115
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,530
I do not!

116
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,540
If it goes to war.

117
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,080
We risk losing everything we have
built.

118
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,310
Our country.

119
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,510
Our family.

120
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,640
Our future.

121
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,380
I decide tomorrow morning.

122
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,770
Caesar.

123
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,950
I was locked up for years in labs.

124
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,230
They cut me, tortured.

125
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,290
You freed me.

126
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,480
I am entirely devoted to you.

127
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,810
We must show our strength!

128
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,380
It's okay Koba.

129
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,950
This is more than 80.

130
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,490
Malcolm!

131
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,940
Primates.

132
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,040
Do. Want. Not. War!

133
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:32,270
But we will fight.

134
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,540
If necessary.

135
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,990
Primates.

136
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,990
Have their homeland.

137
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,600
Humans.

138
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,400
Have their homeland.

139
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,960
Do not return more!

140
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,510
Silence!

141
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,420
Listen to me!

142
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,330
Listen to me, everyone!

143
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,510
They do not want to hurt us.
- How they found us?

144
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,660
Yeah?

145
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,530
It is we who have found.

146
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,240
And if they return?

147
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,800
If they dared, would soundly defeat.

148
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:51,300
Was perhaps not the arms of the
past, but we have the weapons.

149
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,910
Stocks of weapons we have left the
armed.

150
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,980
Everything is available.

151
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,700
I know.

152
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,130
I know why you're afraid.

153
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,280
And I also fear, know it.

154
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,640
But you just put your trust in me.

155
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,460
We went through hell together!

156
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,170
You all know.

157
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,720
Our current problems.

158
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,080
We almost ran out of fuel.

159
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,850
It means more power.

160
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,170
It means the risk.

161
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,020
To plunge in the prior state.

162
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,130
Dam up there was the answer.

163
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,950
We did not know either that they
were up there too.

164
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,660
What now?
- Yeah!

165
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,600
There is another source of energy.

166
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,050
This energy is not.

167
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,250
That to keep our way of life.

168
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,730
But to empower.

169
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:04,550
To reconnect with the world, who
else survived.

170
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,920
So we can start rebuilding.

171
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,020
And return.

172
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,950
The world we have lost.

173
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,790
Nice speech.

174
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:29,010
There is no other source of energy.

175
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,090
This dam is our only chance.

176
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,590
While they fight for him.

177
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,480
In 2
- maximum three weeks there
will be more fuel.
- I know.

178
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,410
And once this is.

179
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,490
We can no longer open to the world,
we call everyone now.

180
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,270
Electricity allows us to operate the
radio.

181
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,770
This is an opportunity to contact
the outside world.

182
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,110
We must find other survivors.
- Indeed.

183
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,820
Unless it is the last.

184
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,030
There are no more victims wants.

185
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,680
We founded this city.
You and me.

186
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,440
Driven by the ambition to restore
your lifestyle.

187
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,030
We must remain united, otherwise we
will not survive.

188
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,730
We lost everything.

189
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,210
The prospect of losing the little
that a.

190
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,750
I want to return up there.

191
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,720
Listen, give me three days.

192
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,460
I talk to him and if it does not
work we follow your plan.

193
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:50,610
And if it induced, we do not even
know if you will understand.

194
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,610
It is more than just a primate.

195
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:04,320
I will put pressure on the council
to argue your position.

196
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,380
If it works I try to get you three
days.

197
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,470
In three days you're back or you
climb exterminate.

198
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,810
Carl, prepare vehicles.

199
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,100
Is combined with a small team
carver.

200
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,450
We will take carver?
He wounded one of them? !

201
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,910
We have no choice, it was a
lumberjack, he knows the forest.

202
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,440
Malcolm.

203
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,470
What you will do up there?
Tell them what?

204
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,200
The truth!

205
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,000
I hope they take good.

206
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,830
You think it's crazy?

207
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,250
I'm afraid.

208
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,940
And me too.

209
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,670
I have thought about it.

210
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:25,050
It takes at least I try, otherwise
the war.

211
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,530
Let me come, I will be helpful if
there is a wounded.

212
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,570
I love you.

213
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,590
I need you here.

214
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,280
You will not be alone, look around
you.

215
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,000
Son, it is not safe.

216
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,870
I feel safer with you here, I'm
going.

217
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,580
Please?

218
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,570
What you gonna tell them?

219
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,570
Do not know.

220
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,560
If I'm not back in two hours, you
can leave the city.

221
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,790
Everything will be alright.

222
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,610
Do not kill me, please.

223
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,830
I have something to tell you.

224
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,490
I know.

225
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,080
Do not come back.

226
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,450
I would not be here if it was not.

227
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,820
Ok!

228
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,150
Ok!

229
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,060
I have to show you something.

230
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,330
Near here.

231
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,400
Men lie.

232
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,380
I swear.

233
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,700
If I show you, you will understand.

234
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,490
I beg you.
.

235
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,780
Show.
Me.

236
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,510
What a hydropower plant.

237
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,250
For supplying the northern region
energy.

238
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,380
Lines going to our city.

239
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:55,440
First we used the nuclear and diesel
generators and natural gas.

240
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,070
If we can raise the dam we will base
our energy.

241
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,090
You understand what I'm saying?

242
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,100
The.
Lights.

243
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,590
Yes I am.

244
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,460
Lights.

245
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,660
This is your country.

246
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,340
Nobody wants you to possess, but.

247
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,150
If we have your permission to work
here.

248
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,680
Where are the others?

249
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,850
There is a small group.

250
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,090
I'm not a threat.

251
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:46,230
If I am, then kill me.

252
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,730
We give them our weapons.

253
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,760
It is their only condition.

254
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,930
Does that mean?
- You can stay.

255
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,910
They will increasingly threatening.

256
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,730
Why help them?

257
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,750
They seem desperate.

258
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,990
If they are expelled, they will
attack.

259
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:12,060
They are removed as they are weak.

260
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,190
How primates die?

261
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,090
This is an opportunity for peace.

262
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,340
Do their work and then they leave
men.

263
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,080
Work.
Men?

264
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,490
Work.
Men!

265
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,360
Work.
Men!

266
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,670
Work.
Men!

267
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,040
Koba said.

268
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,330
He must hate men?

269
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,670
Enough!

270
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,410
Koba knows hatred because men.

271
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,170
But nothing else.

272
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,590
Hey!

273
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,580
You have to eat.

274
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,930
I want a little.
- You were brave today.

275
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,900
I know they have everything about
you.

276
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,350
It's all the same to me.

277
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,640
He is important to me.

278
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,600
Child, he saw horrors, it will not
extend into barbarism.

279
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,600
I know.

280
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,360
I try to be closer to him.

281
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,780
Thou shalt.

282
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,120
What scares me in them.

283
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,450
They do not require energy.
Light.

284
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,800
Heat, nothing.

285
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,000
This is their advantage.

286
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,760
What makes them so strong.

287
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,470
We should do a tour of duty.

288
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,490
With what?
They have our guns.

289
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,860
A weapon is not the solution.
- They are dangerous.

290
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,850
They have already killed most of the
men.
- What?

291
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,980
You'll not blame them.
- Who else then?

292
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,810
It was the monkey flu.
- A virus designed by our
scientists.

293
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,560
They were testing on primates.
- Always the same salads epidemic.

294
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,320
That you did not horrified all those
people that you wanted to save?

295
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,530
You had a good girl?

296
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,220
She died.
- Enough.

297
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,630
You your wife is dead.

298
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,070
Shut up or I'll shut up!

299
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,670
Ok.

300
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,790
It is surely kidding me that.

301
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,830
It's okay?

302
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,700
You're sick?
It's okay?

303
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,440
A little tired.

304
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:37,330
Men you worry.

305
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,190
Where Koba?

306
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,540
He's angry.

307
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,880
They're out hunting.

308
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,340
Look, men down.

309
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,360
What are we doing here?

310
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,800
Caesar trusted them.

311
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,150
Koba was not confident.

312
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,200
Most of the arsenal working.

313
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,750
Tests were done behind.

314
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,250
Do not move!
You understand?

315
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,590
Ted, come here, quick!

316
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,880
Whore!

317
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,770
What do we do?
- Do not know.

318
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,160
How he got?

319
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:47,080
He is alone?
- I do not know.

320
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:52,940
My bastard nature has not spoiled
me.

321
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,640
I think he's hungry.

322
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,880
He lost the group.

323
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,850
You're lost?
You know back?

324
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:29,100
Go outside, turns, silly baboon!

325
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,520
Go!

326
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,940
They have enough guns to kill us
all.

327
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,090
Must prevent Caesar.

328
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,820
Men something wrong.

329
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,470
We must close this loophole.

330
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,550
I did not know you'd had a girl.

331
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,780
Yes I am.

332
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,530
Her name?

333
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,640
Sarah.

334
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,530
I understand your sadness.

335
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:53,490
Now I have you, you and your father.

336
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,020
Like this.

337
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,760
Yes I am.

338
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,840
It worked?

339
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,720
Slowly, we only have one.

340
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,440
What.

341
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:27,990
2. 1.

342
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,720
Malcolm!

343
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,220
Malcolm!

344
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,310
Yes I do!

345
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:13,450
It hurts.
- Do not touch.

346
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,490
Break!

347
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,950
Thank you.

348
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,740
You saved us.

349
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,140
It will take more time to clear.

350
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,790
Hi friend.

351
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,490
What do you do?

352
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,780
Have you finished?

353
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,860
There's what?

354
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,050
What you doing?
- I'll kill you!

355
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,400
Caesar, do not do that!

356
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,890
I do not!

357
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:30,360
I was told.
Not. Weapons!

358
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:35,100
No, please.

359
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,320
I did not know.

360
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,570
You need to.
Get away. Right now!

361
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,990
Malcolm.

362
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,930
Malcolm, where are you going?

363
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,160
Let me just talk to him.

364
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,950
I'm sorry.

365
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,830
Sorry, it's my fault.

366
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,890
You me.

367
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:40,390
You should not be here.
- I understand.

368
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:53,230
He is sick.
- Long time no see?

369
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,150
I drugs, antibiotics.

370
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,650
Maybe it can help.

371
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:16,720
Do. You. Not meddle.

372
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,420
I understand your reaction.

373
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:26,300
Believe me, we're not all like it.
- I beg you.

374
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,390
Let us help you.

375
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:06,590
One day.
I leave you again someday.

376
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,860
No, father!

377
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,600
A little more.
- One day.

378
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,720
Primates help.

379
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,990
I do not want help!

380
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,030
It is anything!
- Calm down.

381
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,480
Ok!

382
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,220
Tomorrow asshole!

383
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,230
In their city.
Men are very dangerous.

384
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,610
Where's Caesar?

385
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,810
The relay is blown, should replace.

386
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,180
Caesar?

387
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,540
No, no!

388
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,860
Where's Caesar?

389
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:29,280
Where Caesar.
Caesar!

390
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:48,930
Men attacking your son.
.

391
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:54,840
And you.
Their. Let. Stay.

392
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,920
You put the endangered primates.

393
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:07,130
Caesar loves men more than primates.

394
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:13,260
More than his son.

395
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:07,420
Primates.
Do not kill. Primates.

396
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,680
Forgive me.

397
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,620
You are my son.

398
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:20,920
You have to listen.

399
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:36,630
You have not talked to Caesar guns!

400
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,980
Does not mention.

401
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,710
Your father is suspicious of me.

402
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,850
You gotta protect.

403
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,400
His feelings for men.

404
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,330
Blindness.

405
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,840
I know.

406
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:15,270
As they are here.

407
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,930
I fear for the life of Caesar.

408
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:13,700
That's yesterday.

409
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,420
A beautiful afternoon.

410
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:58,860
We stood outside.

411
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,340
In the pool.

412
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,350
We stood.

413
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:09,670
Stand.

414
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:27,270
That's good.

415
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:42,450
What's wrong with you, we told you
to leave!

416
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:47,780
I do not!
Will it!

417
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:52,870
He immediately understood.

418
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:55,800
Hey, hey!

419
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,880
It looks like he likes me!

420
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:16,120
You want a drink?

421
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,150
You could drink alcohol.

422
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:23,010
He wants to try at home ish.

423
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,470
Gently!

424
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:31,900
Oh, oh!

425
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,380
Fuck!

426
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,250
This is good, eh?
I need regular.

427
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,840
This is good.

428
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:50,070
Quiet, quiet!

429
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:44,500
Malcolm!
Malcolm!

430
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,740
What happens?

431
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:41,920
- (The weight
- the band) when I
came to Nazareth.

432
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,180
We managed.

433
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:22,910
Our work is done we can start from
the city.

434
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,810
Goodbye!

435
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:58,930
A match.

436
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:02,580
We will take revenge!

437
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,800
[. ].

438
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,310
Lights.

439
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:24,090
You feel better?

440
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,660
Mother!

441
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:18,460
Guns of men!

442
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:42,190
Men killed Caesar!

443
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,100
[. ].

444
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,010
Catch them!

445
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:07,240
Primates should dispose men.

446
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:10,220
We must take revenge.

447
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:14,450
Fight for Caesar.

448
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:20,330
Females and young remain.

449
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:21,010
We go to the city.

450
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:33,530
We will avenge the death of your
father!

451
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:50,560
Ellie, there!

452
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,060
Attempt to communicate
san-francisco.

453
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,320
Please log in, if you get us.

454
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,850
Your location.
Over.

455
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,190
If you receive give us your
situation.
Over.

456
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:25,920
I repeat, attempted communication.

457
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:31,570
If you receive us, please give.

458
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:35,090
Primates attacking armory.

459
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:40,610
Sound the alarm!

460
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:19,670
Keep the doors closed!

461
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:32,300
It's okay.
- Yes I am.

462
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:35,110
[. ].

463
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:38,860
We are survivors!

464
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:43,700
They managed to grab some guns, it
does not make them men.

465
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:48,140
They are animals that will push.

466
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:54,410
Return.
They do not pass these doors!

467
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:36,010
On the streets of California!

468
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:46,220
Come help we attacked.

469
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:48,540
Allo?

470
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:19,200
Capture the men, they escape.

471
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,780
It should not be far.

472
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,090
It is here.

473
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,910
Dad!

474
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:17,110
Malcolm!

475
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:41,810
These are not the men who have hurt
me.

476
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:47,910
[. ].

477
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:54,610
I do not know.

478
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:07,650
Do not talk, you must rest.

479
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:18,350
Hold fast.

480
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:33,130
He lost so much blood.
- It will come out?

481
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:35,920
I do not understand.

482
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,540
Koba would take guns.

483
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:41,710
Why would he do that?

484
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:55,270
Is primates who did this!

485
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,900
Riding in the truck.

486
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:25,490
We followed them here, they lurk
everywhere.

487
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,490
Catch them all!

488
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:50,110
Kill him.
- No, no!

489
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,810
C'mon, ash!

490
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:00,890
Men get paid!

491
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,970
Caesar would not it.

492
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:50,840
Caesar died.

493
01:27:55,680 --> 01:28:01,360
Koba follow you now.

494
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:25,850
I need regular.
He must find a safe place to operate
caesar).

495
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,430
I need regular.
: We will find.

496
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:29,100
Calm, Caesar!

497
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,960
I need regular.
: Faster it loses a lot of blood.

498
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,890
I need regular.
: It is here.

499
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:46,700
Malcolm, fast!

500
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,110
I need regular.
: Here.

501
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:57,330
I need regular.
: This place is safe?

502
01:28:57,330 --> 01:29:02,140
I need regular.
: This is where I lived before
events.

503
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:08,710
I need regular.
: Make us the place, alex.

504
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:14,920
Here.

505
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,850
Ok.

506
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,610
Look!

507
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,430
Look!
.

508
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:34,180
I have to make but I have nothing.

509
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:39,480
I have material to the city but.
- I go.

510
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:43,280
It's dangerous.
- It is the only one who can stop
all.

511
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:52,030
Men!
You.
Prisoners. Primates. Right now.

512
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:56,920
You.
Live. Cage.

513
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:02,680
There are still other men go
looking.

514
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,250
Maurice!

515
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:27,210
Koba said.

516
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,610
It is too devoted to your father.

517
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:36,220
Protect yourself!

518
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,150
I do not!

519
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:15,270
Expect.
Your father.

520
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:20,390
He is alive!

521
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,870
I have what it takes as he goes?

522
01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:04,490
Your.
Mother?

523
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:10,050
Your mother?
Okay?

524
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:14,130
For the time being.

525
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:25,870
I do not!

526
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,100
Not men!

527
01:34:34,570 --> 01:34:37,020
Is Koba!

528
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:50,250
Caesar must now operate.

529
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:56,610
My son!

530
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,260
How it goes?

531
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:38,040
We'll see.

532
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:41,130
It is very strong.

533
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,380
It's okay.

534
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:29,270
I'm sorry.

535
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:31,760
For all.

536
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:34,620
I do not.

537
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:42,480
This is my fault.

538
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:47,010
Koba betrayed you.

539
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:52,900
I wanted to trust him.

540
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:57,820
Because it is primate.

541
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:05,450
I always thought that primates were
better than men.

542
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:09,900
Now I see.

543
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:16,180
How much we resemble their.

544
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:24,280
Koba is where now?

545
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:27,660
The tower of men.

546
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,970
He is surrounded by his followers.

547
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:34,880
Those who do not follow?

548
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,880
Prisoners.

549
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:39,920
Maurice.

550
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:42,230
Rocket.

551
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:48,260
Koba killed ash.

552
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:57,040
Fear makes them loyal.

553
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:01,580
But when they make you alive.

554
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:05,480
They turn away from Koba.

555
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,810
They are weak.

556
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:15,900
Primates always looking for a strong
leader.

557
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:23,310
We must do something to stop.

558
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,510
Father.

559
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:41,140
Let me help you.

560
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:03,890
An apple.
An apple.

561
01:42:04,430 --> 01:42:05,910
Okay.

562
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:08,720
House.

563
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,720
House.

564
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:14,930
House.

565
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:17,930
Yes I am.

566
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,640
Is your home.

567
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:23,100
It is home.

568
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:27,730
Here, though.

569
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:30,000
Very well.

570
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:57,090
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

571
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:04,440
It's been three days.

572
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:13,800
Your son is not back yet.

573
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,950
Is that.

574
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,750
The video?

575
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:29,160
A good man.

576
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:34,140
Like you.

577
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:10,010
Take him to the tower discreetly by
metro.

578
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:16,380
Koba fetched females and young.

579
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:18,910
They arrive.

580
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,790
Mother too.

581
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:24,050
We go right away.

582
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,580
It goes well?

583
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,710
Who goes there?

584
01:44:49,710 --> 01:44:52,570
Do you human?

585
01:44:52,570 --> 01:44:56,840
It's me, malcolm, do not shoot.

586
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:02,850
Take the stairs we find ourselves in
the street, go!

587
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:10,000
I trust you.

588
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:22,510
I do, do not shoot.

589
01:45:39,150 --> 01:45:42,610
Finally you are!

590
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:45,360
I was wondering if you were alive.

591
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:49,610
Do not worry, we will encircle.

592
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:50,890
What?

593
01:45:50,890 --> 01:45:54,900
Primates took refuge in the tower,
they lost the city.

594
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:58,910
Look what we have here.

595
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:03,450
C4, explosives, plastic.
[Here, san-francisco, do you read
me?
].

596
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:09,010
We just put it down, all the while
going to jump.

597
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:16,210
It makes them all jump.
We need you.

598
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:57,690
Here, san-francisco.

599
01:46:57,690 --> 01:47:00,920
If you get me, please.

600
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:08,360
Go!

601
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:25,390
Here, san-francisco.

602
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:32,850
It's okay?
- It's okay? .

603
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:49,940
Dreyfus!

604
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,720
Werner!

605
01:47:58,510 --> 01:48:01,830
Sorry, I can not let you do.

606
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:05,950
Must leave them a chance.

607
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:08,550
It takes time.

608
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:11,800
It's up there right now.

609
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:15,120
What you doing?

610
01:48:51,470 --> 01:48:53,530
Caesar.

611
01:48:53,530 --> 01:48:59,920
Has nothing to do here.

612
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:05,770
Primates following Koba now.

613
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:13,400
Koba after the war.

614
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:21,050
Primates can fight together they are
strong.

615
01:49:25,950 --> 01:49:30,130
Caesar is weak.

616
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:36,920
Koba is lower.

617
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:58,500
Primates.

618
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,930
You're crazy!

619
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:34,720
I know what they are capable.

620
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:39,910
All they want is to survive.
- They are animals.

621
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:44,010
Because they believed that the first
attack.

622
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:46,650
Sitting finney!

623
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:48,550
Sitting!

624
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:14,660
I considered him a brother you.

625
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:20,160
Caesar is the brother of men.

626
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:26,160
Koba fights for free primates.

627
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:31,320
Koba Koba fights for.

628
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:45,210
Koba is no longer cage.

629
01:52:33,530 --> 01:52:40,360
I know you do not understand.
- You do not realize you.

630
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:48,980
You're just delaying things, they
come.

631
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:52,490
It is in contact with a military
base north.

632
01:52:52,490 --> 01:52:55,380
They are numerous, they come.

633
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:57,380
He's right.

634
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:06,120
Dreyfus, what are you doing?

635
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:17,610
I save the human race.
- I do not.

636
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:47,310
Primates do not kill primates.

637
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:16,870
You, you're not.

638
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:19,870
A primate.

639
01:57:40,230 --> 01:57:42,790
Free-lez.

640
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:02,700
It is not safe here.

641
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,190
They called the army.

642
01:58:06,190 --> 01:58:09,060
Leaving all now.

643
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:11,600
Caesar, if you do not go.

644
01:58:11,690 --> 01:58:13,430
It will be total war.

645
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:17,480
The war has already.

646
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,480
Started.

647
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:25,670
They started the war.

648
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:29,800
Men.

649
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:33,570
Men.

650
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:36,460
Never forgive.

651
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:41,500
You have to leave.

652
01:58:42,210 --> 01:58:46,980
Before the fights begin.

653
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:50,250
Sorry.

654
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:54,960
My friend.

655
01:58:59,630 --> 01:59:02,020
They gave you your chance.

656
01:59:05,730 --> 01:59:09,270
I too have given you.
