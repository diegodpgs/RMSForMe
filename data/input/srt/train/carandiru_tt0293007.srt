The following film is
based on real-life events.

1
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,564
Hey, Ebony!

2
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,926
You bastard! I'll knife you in the back!

3
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,560
-Get this guy out of here!
-There's no more room.

4
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:35,359
We've got to use this cell!
Cool it or there'll be trouble!

5
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,445
Get off me!

6
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,760
I wanna see that. Come on!

7
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,602
You've betrayed me!

8
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:47,767
Dagger! I'll kill you, you hear?
Stick you like a pig.

9
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:52,959
Ebony, Lula's freaked out...

10
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,848
...says it's his right to kill Dagger.

11
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,000
Lula needs to be taught a lesson!

12
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,920
Whatever's happened...

13
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,364
...it's not for you to decide,
you little shit!

14
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:08,080
-Dagger!
-Dagger's gonna die!

15
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,725
-Gonna die!
-Calm down!

16
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,644
You think you're gonna decide this?
Come on, then, I'm ready.

17
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,768
-What's this?
-Gonna die! Gonna die!

18
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,761
Like I said, I've got no one
waiting for me on the outside.

19
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:28,005
I'm in no hurry to get out.

20
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,966
Anyone wants a fight,
let's get on with it.

21
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:32,279
I'll crush all of you.

22
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:38,684
What the fuck's wrong with you guys?!
Let's cool it here!

23
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,600
What's going on, Dagger?

24
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,125
-Lula attacked me from behind, Ebony.
-He's a badass!

25
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:47,678
He went for Dagger from behind!

26
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,482
Right out of line, man!

27
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,608
Gonna die!

28
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,567
Gonna die!

29
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,964
-You locking me in there, Ebony?
-First get in there, then speak!

30
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:09,202
-Don't throw Dagger in here, Ebony.
-We don't want trouble.

31
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:10,882
Step away, damn it!

32
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,728
So? I'm all ears.

33
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,006
How come he's so mad at you?

34
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,761
You heard.

35
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:22,046
Lula came out of nowhere with a knife
and tried to kill me.

36
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,528
I dodged.

37
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:27,045
We scuffled till they broke us up.

38
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,078
The rest you know.

39
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:47,157
Good morning, Mr. Pires.

40
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:51,445
I do apologize for this
disgusting behavior...

41
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,808
...which has invaded our household
today.

42
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:03,280
Only this idiot Lula,
a young, inexperienced con...

43
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,967
...suddenly got this attitude,
without even asking permission!

44
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:10,802
Dagger killed my father!
He killed my father!

45
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,880
I sure did, kid.

46
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,803
And not only him,
I've killed plenty more besides.

47
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:20,723
Ebony! Mr. Pires!
Dagger killed my father...

48
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:24,325
...in front of my mother.
He's been telling everyone!

49
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:28,323
You gonna deny that, asshole?!
Are you gonna deny it? Are you?

50
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:31,003
-Ebony, please.
-What?

51
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,444
Tell the kid he doesn't know
half the story.

52
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:36,760
-lf he did....
-Son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

53
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:41,686
Tell him to ask his mother if she
was really as upset as all that.

54
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:45,683
Or was it a relief when I came
and grabbed his belt from him?

55
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,362
Lies! That's a lie!

56
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:51,238
Like hell it is! I saw it for myself.

57
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:55,644
He'd have thrashed her to death.

58
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:04,239
I thought you'd have heard
by now, kid!

59
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:10,640
Your mother paid me
to kill your father.

60
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:13,565
Get it now?

61
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,641
It was your mother who wiped him out!

62
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,163
Hear that?

63
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:47,718
He's calmed down!

64
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,008
He's calmed down!

65
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,078
I want them both out here
in their underwear.

66
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:34,765
Lula, as far as I'm concerned,
we're quits.

67
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:41,122
Let's forget it, shall we?

68
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:51,125
You've put me to shame, and on
the day of the doctor's first visit.

69
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:01,606
So, Lula, what brought
you back in here?

70
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,327
I left here...

71
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,561
...went home and found
my wife in bed with someone else.

72
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:09,243
The son of a bitch had the nerve
to tell me, "That's life."

73
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,764
I shot him three times just
to prove the contrary.

74
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:16,207
You should know that whatever
goes on outside gets settled outside.

75
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:21,682
In here, anyone who behaves
knows we'll do what we can...

76
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:26,764
...to show him the front door,
where his family is waiting.

77
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:31,408
But anyone who's proud of being
a criminal, with blood in his eye...

78
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:35,839
...we'll do everything to
prolong his life in here.

79
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,687
We usually forget people
like that in here.

80
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,519
Doctor, this is Ebony.

81
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:55,160
Yes, doctor,
Ebony's got a problem.

82
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,882
My kitchen knife is still missing.

83
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:02,609
Whoever took it,
I'll give you one chance.

84
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:07,647
Return it or there'll be
one prisoner dead every day!

85
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:12,041
I'd like to ask our visitors
to turn their backs...

86
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:15,528
...since there's an ashamed
crook present.

87
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:20,045
But when I turn around...

88
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,037
...I sure would like to see that knife.

89
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,085
I'll count to three.

90
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,008
One...

91
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:30,882
...two....

92
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,121
I'm turning.

93
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,443
Three.

94
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:48,078
-From your kitchen?
-Yes, sir.

95
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:54,001
This is the yellow wing, doctor,
because they're afraid.

96
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,319
It's like a jail within the jail.

97
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:59,367
They're locked up here for their
own safety. They're scared.

98
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:03,408
Career killers, rapists,
stool pigeons, bad payers.

99
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,799
In here, you know,
prisoners never forgive.

100
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:09,279
Mr. Pires, don't these people
ever get sun? It's so musty!

101
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,006
Anyone want to go outside?

102
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:19,048
Take a walk in the yard?
Get some fresh air?

103
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,447
-What do these people do all day?
-They come and go all day long...

104
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,601
...think they're busy,
but it gets them nowhere.

105
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:43,847
Doctor, 7000 men in jail!

106
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,284
There are 1800
in this pavilion alone.

107
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:50,637
If they knew how AIDS is spread,
that would already help.

108
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:55,405
They catch the disease and have sex,
so there's no stopping the epidemic.

109
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:59,084
The only ones who'll listen to your
advice are the really smart ones...

110
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:02,639
...who only want to get out alive
in order to keep robbing.

111
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:03,958
That's their whole life.

112
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:07,838
Maybe. But they're living
at the center of the disease.

113
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:11,239
-They're the prisoners here.
-Prisoners?

114
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,568
They own this cell. This place doesn't
explode because they don't want it to.

115
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:18,000
God bless you, child.

116
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,085
I didn't know you had a family.

117
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:26,921
I thought I'd lost it.

118
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,926
My whole life in jail...

119
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:31,045
...but even so I raised 18 kids...

120
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,848
...and not one of them has even been
near a police station.

121
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:36,763
That girl, my youngest...

122
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,199
...she said she doesn't remember
my face...

123
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:41,280
...so she's decided to come and visit.

124
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,686
I'd like you to authorize me to see her.

125
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:50,886
I don't want my daughter
around all the scum.

126
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:53,485
That's going to be tricky.

127
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,209
What if the 7000 others
ask me the same thing?

128
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,608
Excuse me.

129
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:06,524
Good morning.

130
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,647
Hey, what's up?

131
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:28,920
Need anything, doctor?
Coffee, sugar, chocolate, toothpaste?

132
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,962
Joints are only two packs
of Marlboros each. Want one?

133
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,562
I don't smoke.

134
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:37,563
Too bad! Commerce, doctor!
Makes the world go round!

135
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:43,564
Let's go.

136
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,847
Easy, now. That's it.

137
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,242
Slow.

138
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:56,841
He can't spit there.

139
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,121
Tuberculosis. Anyone steps
on that, spreads the disease.

140
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:04,642
If he had the strength,
he'd go to the sink.

141
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:07,248
It's not easy.

142
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:09,887
He must be isolated.

143
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,122
But where, doctor?

144
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,164
Name?

145
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:23,559
Everyone calls me the Beard.

146
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:27,128
Why are you here?

147
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:29,164
Well...

148
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:31,526
...my brother was killed.

149
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:36,720
Two days later, the murderer
had a little meeting with death...

150
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,849
...so suspicions fell upon my
good self.

151
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:45,802
Some said I did it and others came
along and said they saw it wasn't me.

152
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:49,963
With some saying it was me
and others saying not...

153
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:54,919
...here I am, five years now,
waiting for the judge to decide.

154
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:59,762
Do you have sex here in jail?

155
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:04,325
-Anyone who denies that is a liar.
-Use condoms?

156
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,641
If I've got one, I do.

157
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:09,437
-IV drugs?
-How dare you, doctor?

158
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:12,919
I wonder, Beard!
What's that mark on your arm?

159
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,841
Beard is next!

160
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,168
My name's Alipio.

161
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,287
Do you use drugs?

162
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,842
Needles?

163
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:48,639
No way, doctor. I got AIDS from
all the ass I've had in jail.

164
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:51,123
Plenty of ass.

165
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,280
Is it still worth taking the test?

166
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,569
I listen, give advice...

167
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:05,243
...a little tenderness,
hold them tight...

168
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,966
...and then they always give us
something nice in return.

169
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,520
A pack of cigarettes, some candy,
a slice of cheese.

170
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,079
So many men shut up
in here, doctor...

171
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:20,127
...without our feminine support.

172
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:22,757
Yeah, I've got AIDS,
but I didn't get it in here.

173
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,648
I brought it in off the streets,
and I can't complain.

174
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:31,008
You come in here sick and they
treat you with respect, dignity...

175
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,967
...and that's the greatest thing
in a crook's life.

176
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,881
I'm a junkie and a dealer.

177
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:40,520
In my business, if a guy doesn't
pay up, I can't take back...

178
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:43,965
...what I sold him. The bastard's
already smoked it, snorted it.

179
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:46,525
I take whatever he's got.

180
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,449
If he's got nothing, I kill him.

181
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,245
The other day I tried to get
an extra banana from the guy...

182
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:57,606
...who delivers lunch. The bastard
said only if I kissed his banana.

183
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,158
So what the hell,
I'm just crazy about bananas.

184
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:03,401
Doctor, everyone in my cell's
got this itch.

185
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,843
It's unbearable.

186
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:08,122
Scabies. I'll give you some medicine.

187
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,839
So how are you getting along?

188
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,959
Doctor, after shooting cocaine
in the dark with a blunt needle...

189
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:19,689
...drawing blood with this rig...

190
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:22,079
...is hardly fair play.

191
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,288
Too bad!

192
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,847
See what you did?

193
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,047
See what you did?

194
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,727
-Who are you?
-I'm the doctor.

195
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,164
I was taking blood samples.

196
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,240
-Just ask--
-Watch out!

197
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,923
Like you have
to tell me who to ask.

198
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:08,162
I'm calling the duty officer.
Wait here.

199
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:11,127
If no one can identify you,
you're staying right where you are.

200
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,043
Don't take it personally.
It's their job to escape...

201
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:40,961
...and mine not to let them.

202
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,678
Doctor!

203
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,002
You coming back?

204
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:15,838
I knew many of those men hadn't
shown their victims any mercy...

205
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,318
...but society has its judges.

206
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,480
And I wasn't one of them.

207
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:23,921
At the same time,
what did I have to do with all that?

208
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:25,966
I had two choices.:

209
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,643
Forget or go back.

210
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,447
Take a deep breath.

211
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:36,484
Smoker?

212
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:37,798
Just cigarettes.

213
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:40,560
-No crack?
-Never.

214
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,722
Sleep well?

215
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:45,477
Hardly, doctor.
The mind never stops...

216
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:49,608
...what with one guy trying to settle
a score outside, collecting a debt...

217
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,284
...another trying to dig a tunnel.
And there goes another day.

218
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:57,442
-You still got much time to do?
-A few more years.

219
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,088
And why did you come here?

220
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:02,719
-Legitimate self-defense, doctor.
-That lands you in jail nowadays?

221
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:04,004
It did in my case.

222
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,844
Here's what happened.
It was Christmas...

223
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:11,043
...the bells ringing,
snow in the windows.

224
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:16,927
Me, Bristles and Fatso arranged
to do a jewelry store job.

225
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,762
Neat work, doctor.
Never even fired a shot.

226
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,567
The problem was later.

227
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,485
How are we going to split it up?

228
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:08,157
Fatso and I will make three
piles and you choose first.

229
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,884
Son, not now.
Get out! Go on!

230
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:16,597
Go on, son!

231
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:39,199
You fucking moron!

232
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:42,727
We're splitting the loot and you
come at me with your hand covered?

233
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,606
It's his own fault he died.

234
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:53,808
What the fuck's going on?

235
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,360
So you shot him in the heat of
the moment...

236
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:02,524
...but we had agreed for me
to shoot you...

237
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,766
...so we could take your share.

238
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,362
So shoot!

239
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,687
Go on, fire away!

240
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:17,202
I can't, damn it.

241
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:19,168
Give me your rod.

242
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,641
Oh, my God!

243
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:36,478
Being betrayed by your buddy for
nothing, doctor...

244
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:41,837
...like Judas, the guy who
spat in the face of Jesus.

245
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:43,886
So how does the story end?

246
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:47,167
It ends with me in here,
before your eyes, doctor.

247
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:49,604
Fatso was arrested in
under two months.

248
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:54,087
Doctor, ever seen a fat man
being beaten? They talk too much.

249
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:21,008
A man was killed here.
Did you see anything?

250
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:22,483
No.

251
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:32,045
Jesus, Fatso. You turned me in
for Bristles' murder!

252
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:35,038
You could have just squealed
about the robbery.

253
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:39,244
I fingered you for murder because
Bristles' brother would kill me.

254
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:43,081
We left his place together
for the jewelry store...

255
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:46,400
...then I came back alive
and he got back dead.

256
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,242
I'm very upset.

257
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:55,447
I could turn you in as an accomplice...

258
00:23:56,249 --> 00:23:58,524
...but I won't. I'll back your story up.

259
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:02,839
I killed him and I threw him
in the river all by myself.

260
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:09,121
Thanks, Ebony!
I knew I could count on you.

261
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:14,238
I'll forgive you,
but you owe me one.

262
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,967
And did Fatso ever pay his debt?

263
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:21,122
No way! Fatso died trying to escape.

264
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:24,804
They spent two years
digging a tunnel.

265
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:35,637
Wait!

266
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:41,486
Let's go, come on!

267
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:49,118
I'm stuck!

268
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:55,398
Go on, Fatso!
Hurry up, you big pile of shit!

269
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,843
Go on, damn it!

270
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:59,081
Give me a hand!

271
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:02,407
-I'm stuck.
-Breathe in, man.

272
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:05,118
-Suck yourself in.
-What do you mean?

273
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:08,520
-I can't!
-Go back, then.

274
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:11,602
-Go on!
-Give me a break, Cadao.

275
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:15,882
-Pull, go on, pull!
-Shit, Fatso, I told you!

276
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:19,837
-Eating everyone else's leftovers.
-Pull, go on!

277
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:27,365
Fatso's frustrated brothers knifed him.

278
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:31,320
Hell of a way to die, eh, doctor?

279
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:35,124
Right under the Virgin Mary
and not even she could protect him.

280
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:36,888
Too bad.

281
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:40,077
What about this pain?

282
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:44,801
Your problem, Ebony, is stress.
What bigshot executives get.

283
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:48,480
Take one of these before bed.
They'll help you sleep.

284
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:51,959
-lf you don't get better, come back.
-God protect you, doctor.

285
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:59,200
Doctor, come and see...

286
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,599
...Chico's balloon, quick!

287
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:12,086
It's the old man's obsession,
doctor.

288
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:24,168
Oh, too bad!

289
00:26:24,689 --> 00:26:26,008
May I?

290
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:29,565
Hi, I'm Lady.

291
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:34,678
-Lady Di. I've come to take the test.
-Please, take a seat.

292
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:47,038
First I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

293
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:50,846
I've seen this movie before,
doctor.

294
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:56,321
I've never needed a blood transfusion
and I never pierce my veins.

295
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:01,804
The only drug I use is
a joint now and then...

296
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:05,679
...when I watch TV
or for a little romance.

297
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:08,443
And partners? How many?

298
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,248
Oh, about 2000.

299
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,727
The silicone you used
isn't meant for that.

300
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,764
As if I had the money
for something better, doctor.

301
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,567
Ever taken hormones?

302
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:42,802
No way! Hormones are dreadful!
You take them and nothing happens.

303
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:46,962
And what our clients like, maybe
you know, is to play the girl.

304
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:52,766
Well, Lady, I think the time's come
for you to find out if you're sick.

305
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,046
I'll do it, doctor.

306
00:27:58,129 --> 00:27:59,323
Will it hurt?

307
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:00,842
Just a little.

308
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,488
Get out, man!

309
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:42,603
Hallowed be thy name,
Thy kingdom come

310
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:47,445
Thy will be done,
On Earth as it is in heaven

311
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:50,886
Give us this day
Our daily bread

312
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:15,037
Any room in there?

313
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:21,278
Sure.

314
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:30,287
Only it'll cost you 200.

315
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,368
Pay for a bed? I'm in jail, man!

316
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:38,279
So? Did you live for free
on the outside?

317
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,885
If you want to stay, sleep on the floor.

318
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:49,164
Deusdete ain't sleeping on no floor.

319
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,965
He already has a place.

320
00:29:58,489 --> 00:29:59,763
Deusdete.

321
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:02,400
Just like I said, right, brother?

322
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,760
You ended up doing something
you shouldn't.

323
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:11,679
Men with cell phones...

324
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:17,003
...were patrolling the neighborhood.

325
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:28,161
It was 4 p.m., the day before
yesterday. It was 4 p.m....

326
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,517
And the rat?

327
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:02,802
I smashed it against the wall
about 10 times!

328
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:09,127
Damn thing wouldn't let go!

329
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:10,278
It died?

330
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:16,966
Like hell it did! So I grabbed it
and stuck my teeth into its brain.

331
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:19,643
Then I just brushed my teeth
and that was that.

332
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:25,123
Easy, man! You've been beaten with
iron bars and never made a sound.

333
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:26,927
Sweet Mama, pray for me!

334
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:38,039
Cut your finger, Highness?

335
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:43,998
Jesus, Lula, smoking crack?
You can't operate like that!

336
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:47,206
Sorry, doctor, only I operate
better when I smoke.

337
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:49,969
What?! You can't keep
a steady hand on crack!

338
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:54,202
That's where you're wrong. I see the
veins all shining and fluorescent.

339
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:56,758
Looks like that casino
in Las Vegas!

340
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,167
Take it easy, man!

341
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:02,599
See, doctor, isn't that great?

342
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:05,488
Steady as a rock and hardly
a millimeter between stitches.

343
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,482
God protect you, Lula.
God bless you, God bless you all.

344
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:11,959
That's enough of God, Highness,
you're not kidding anyone.

345
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:14,040
What, you married twice?

346
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:17,321
Well, doctor, to me life's
a merry-go-round...

347
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:19,605
...and just the one horse isn't enough.

348
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:22,721
That one there. That's Dalva's.

349
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:24,807
My princess.

350
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:43,244
Honey, score a goal for me?

351
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:45,843
Score a goal for me, please?

352
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:50,168
Like it?

353
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:51,478
Yeah, I bet you do.

354
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:06,720
-You believe in love at first sight?
-What?

355
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:11,366
Come with me. I'm going to ask
your parents for your hand.

356
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:15,044
-You don't even know me!
-You're wrong!

357
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,799
-Wrong? You don't know me.
-Sure I do.

358
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:22,240
-I know you just love spicy....
-Sausage.

359
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:27,278
And I know you look gorgeous
in that pretty dress.

360
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:30,409
And I know you deserve better
than that klutz over there.

361
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:31,604
My fiance!

362
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:33,521
-Fiance?!
-Fiance.

363
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:36,721
You're wasting your time.

364
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,208
Look...

365
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:44,366
...what a great blend!
We'll have one kid of each color.

366
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,401
I'll be waiting in the car.

367
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:01,887
Were you serious?

368
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,801
Never been more.

369
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:08,527
What the hell is going on, Dalva?

370
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:10,088
What are you doing there?

371
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:15,284
Go on, go away, will you?

372
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:18,084
What?!
Honey, who is this?

373
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:20,160
-I'm her husband.
-Husband?

374
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,001
Sure. We're marrying.

375
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:24,399
-Come on, Dalva.
-Don't grab me like that!

376
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:27,205
-Stop it!
-Get out of here, go on!

377
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:29,041
-Stop it!
-What's this?

378
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:35,363
See? See that?

379
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:38,885
If he were in love with you,
he wouldn't have run off!

380
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:46,724
Jesus! Letting some guy steal his girl!

381
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,726
Tomorrow at 8:00,
get your family together...

382
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,686
...and I'll ask for your hand.

383
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,197
Best thing that could
have happened to me, doctor.

384
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:03,201
Dalva gave me a family.

385
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:04,688
So you stopped stealing.

386
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,967
Of course not, doctor.
With her by my side, I went upmarket.

387
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:11,359
Took imported cars and
drove them to Paraguay.

388
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:14,885
With cash in my pocket,
I returned to the peace of home life.

389
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:18,604
-Any kids?
-Three with Dalva.

390
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:20,608
And one with Rosirene.

391
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:24,245
You know how it is: the devil
only tempts those close to God.

392
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,364
That ever happened to you?
Uncontrollable passion?

393
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:22,678
What's with the babe over there?

394
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:33,127
What do you think?

395
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:34,888
She's over there.

396
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:42,966
Don't you dance samba, miss?

397
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:49,001
What am I, a monkey jumping
around for nothing?

398
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:55,798
Looking for something to jump to?

399
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,808
Seems like you're the one wanting
to jump. Jump shit.

400
00:37:03,129 --> 00:37:06,724
Look, I'll take my wife home.
Get your bikini...

401
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:10,245
...and I'll come and fetch you.
We'll spend the weekend at the beach.

402
00:37:11,249 --> 00:37:14,924
-Does she know you belong to me?
-Ease up! I was going to the john.

403
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:18,240
Like hell you were. And that?
Why is that so hard, then?

404
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:21,282
Doesn't look like it's being
properly cared for.

405
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:26,601
-Watch your mouth, you black bitch!
-Wait!

406
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:29,158
Get away from my man
or you'll be sorry!

407
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:30,523
You'll be sorry!

408
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:33,604
Hey, handsome!

409
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,604
So I guess the beach is off, then?

410
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:44,801
So, what happened
to the black girl?

411
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:48,402
Now, that's where I had to do
a bit of juggling, doctor.

412
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:52,198
From Monday to Thursday, Dalva.
And the rest, Rosirene.

413
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:55,202
I rented a little room for us
near the old bus station.

414
00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:57,883
We had this great
love affair going, doctor.

415
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:02,802
Morning!

416
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:12,318
-Give me that!
-It's mine!

417
00:38:16,649 --> 00:38:18,879
Stop, you're messing me up!

418
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,038
Stop!

419
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,279
Don't let go of me, Highness.

420
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:37,323
Don't let go!

421
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:58,959
You just can't quit this life,
can you?

422
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:01,040
I told you I'd take care of you.

423
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:03,880
I've always earned my own money.

424
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:07,725
And that guy you were with,
know who he is?

425
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,683
What are you doing here?
I thought it was Snow White's day.

426
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,841
Don't change the subject.
You know who he is?

427
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:17,160
Sure. So what?

428
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:19,524
So what?

429
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:22,889
So I told you,
do your thing if you have to...

430
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:26,280
...but don't screw friends of mine
or I'll break your neck.

431
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,804
Powder's your friend?

432
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:33,287
Highness, you're a nobody.

433
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:39,405
He said that when he leaves his wife
we'll move to Miami.

434
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,521
I'm off!

435
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:44,644
Where to?

436
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:49,120
To Miami, honey!

437
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:53,079
-Miami!
-You're taking a souvenir of mine.

438
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,760
No! Get off me!

439
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:59,045
Highness, get off me!

440
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:00,608
Get off!

441
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:07,002
That was rough, screwing a friend
of mine and the two making plans.

442
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:10,479
That night, I went back to the room.
And what do I see?

443
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:17,283
Jesus. Get out of here.

444
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:19,763
No way.

445
00:40:20,729 --> 00:40:22,560
Get out of here right now.

446
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:25,838
I won't go.

447
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:28,523
Get out, damn it!

448
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:32,318
No way, I'm staying.

449
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:35,846
Come on, Highness, bite me.

450
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:37,718
Come on...

451
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,843
...bite me...

452
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:42,800
...bite me the way I like it.

453
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:47,728
Bite!

454
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:49,641
Bite, go on, bite!

455
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:51,845
Bite harder...

456
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:53,761
...harder!

457
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,643
Harder!

458
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:58,765
Bite harder!

459
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:27,403
It's over!

460
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:31,524
Damn it!

461
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,283
There, that's so you learn
not to take what's not yours.

462
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:36,246
You arsonist bitch!

463
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:37,603
Slut!

464
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:41,284
Well, you might as well know that
this slut is expecting his child.

465
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:42,677
No!

466
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:46,844
Son of a bitch whore!

467
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:48,283
I'll kill you!

468
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,842
You son of a bitch whore!

469
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,125
You haven't heard
the last of this, Highness!

470
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:55,723
-You haven't heard the last of this!
-Son of a bitch!

471
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:01,641
Come here! Come here!

472
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:03,242
Get your hands off my son!

473
00:42:03,409 --> 00:42:07,004
To keep Dalva out of trouble,
I took the blame for the fire.

474
00:42:07,649 --> 00:42:10,083
Only, the law was already
on my back for other stuff...

475
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:13,608
...so I got 16 years for the fire...

476
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:15,686
...reduced to 10.

477
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:20,286
-And was it worth it?
-The black chick put a spell on me.

478
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:22,848
I'm out of here!

479
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:27,638
Therefore, perfectly calmly,
we shall overcome the niggling...

480
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:32,803
...irresponsible and lying attempts
to inv olve the government....

481
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:47,844
So, what's up?

482
00:42:57,769 --> 00:42:59,043
Letter from Franci?

483
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:07,721
Your sister mention me at all?

484
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:10,438
Of course she does, right?

485
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:20,447
Hey, Deusdete! What does
your sister say about me?

486
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,441
She asks if you're okay.

487
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:26,878
That's all?

488
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,162
What do you think?

489
00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:34,405
If she knew what you've been up to,
she wouldn't even be asking that.

490
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:37,881
I think she would...

491
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,960
...but you think you know better.

492
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:45,446
Wasn't it you who used to say,
" If you sell it, don't use it"?

493
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:46,804
Wasn't it you?

494
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:50,758
May I?

495
00:43:51,049 --> 00:43:52,198
So, what's up?

496
00:43:54,129 --> 00:43:55,881
Come to settle your debt?

497
00:43:56,209 --> 00:43:59,679
Hey, man, right now Ezequiel's
in a tight spot.

498
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:02,762
So he thinks to himself,
"Zico's a reasonable guy.

499
00:44:03,049 --> 00:44:05,722
He'll take the surfboard
as collateral for the debt."

500
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:10,086
Then Ezequiel can have another
little rock of crack, right, man?

501
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,648
Wrong.

502
00:44:19,729 --> 00:44:21,924
Pay what you owe!

503
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:29,000
Don't drink that, it's blood!

504
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:33,078
Shit!

505
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:36,167
I thought it was water.

506
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:40,242
Doctor, this guy was
sweating all night long.

507
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:43,082
I've put him on antibiotics,
but if you ask me, it's no use.

508
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:44,318
It's AIDS.

509
00:44:47,409 --> 00:44:48,728
Doctor!

510
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:52,326
Who took away his oxygen?

511
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:56,727
I don't want to die.

512
00:44:57,529 --> 00:45:01,078
Get me out of here, please!

513
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:06,642
That's hardly likely.
He's 213. Rape.

514
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:09,245
To us he's a patient.

515
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:15,848
I can't....

516
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:17,761
I need...

517
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:19,840
...to get somewhere safe.

518
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:23,082
-I don't want to die!
-I'm sorry, doctor.

519
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:27,720
I'm against the death penalty,
but not for rape.

520
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:30,005
If you ask me, it's just too bad.

521
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:37,918
So that's it, doctor.

522
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:18,443
Come on, old man. It's past lockdown.

523
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:40,962
Get a move on!

524
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:50,525
What is it? What are you looking at?

525
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:54,522
You think your kids
will jump over the wall?

526
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:18,205
You were asking for it this time,
weren't you?

527
00:47:23,929 --> 00:47:25,885
See you in 30 days.

528
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:37,759
Doctor, we're here to make
our relationship official.

529
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:39,920
With all due respect.

530
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:44,287
You understand, doctor.
So we can be more open.

531
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:46,804
It's not the same with a rubber.

532
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:50,759
There's not much sense,
her taking the test and not you.

533
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:54,559
See? I told him, doctor,
but he's scared.

534
00:47:55,049 --> 00:47:56,277
Scared of what?

535
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:59,848
-Scared of injections.
-Too Bad!

536
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:02,967
-It's not that.
-So you're scared of getting married!

537
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:03,569
Doctor, you're needed, urgently!

538
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,799
Doctor, you're needed, urgently!

539
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:06,924
Come on!

540
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:08,886
Down you go, come on!

541
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:11,088
It's all right now, doctor.

542
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:14,968
I blacked out, doctor.

543
00:48:16,729 --> 00:48:18,447
Giving us all a fright, Zico?

544
00:48:19,849 --> 00:48:23,046
It's just as well, doctor.
Maybe he'll learn what drugs do.

545
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:24,444
Tell him!

546
00:48:24,649 --> 00:48:27,083
What's there to tell? Drugs kill.

547
00:48:28,169 --> 00:48:30,239
-And you, who are you?
-That's Deusdete.

548
00:48:31,249 --> 00:48:33,160
We grew up together.

549
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:36,482
You know, doctor...

550
00:48:37,089 --> 00:48:39,239
...one day my mother
didn't come home.

551
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:41,088
I was left alone.

552
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:42,598
I waited...

553
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:44,683
...and waited...

554
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:51,563
...until he and his sister, Franci,
came and took me to live with them.

555
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:02,848
We grew up together.

556
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:08,329
Wait!

557
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:30,643
Come on, Zico!

558
00:49:45,169 --> 00:49:47,000
Wait, Zico!

559
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:14,362
Zico!

560
00:50:17,729 --> 00:50:18,798
Help!

561
00:50:51,129 --> 00:50:52,801
Zico saved me, doctor.

562
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:58,122
That's right. I've always
looked after him, from early on.

563
00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:02,288
Then you went the wrong way.

564
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:11,322
What's wrong with buying some dope
and selling it to folks who like it?

565
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:15,207
It wasn't even that much!
Another two years and I'm free.

566
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:18,043
But I've never killed anyone.

567
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:20,961
Unlike Deusdete here.

568
00:51:21,889 --> 00:51:23,527
What was your crime?

569
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:25,641
Answer him, Deusdete!

570
00:51:30,809 --> 00:51:34,438
To tell you the truth,
he's not even a real criminal.

571
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:38,445
So, what are you in here for?

572
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:43,360
One night, I was at home...

573
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:46,245
...when my sister arrived,
acting strange.

574
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:48,517
Franci!

575
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:51,722
What's wrong, Franci?
What happened?

576
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:53,282
Franci!

577
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:02,719
Franci, what happened?

578
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:05,683
Open up, come on.

579
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:08,126
What happened?

580
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:17,082
What happened, Franci?

581
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:22,885
What happened? Tell me.

582
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,919
What happened?

583
00:52:28,769 --> 00:52:29,918
Tell me!

584
00:52:30,929 --> 00:52:32,647
There were two of them...

585
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:36,242
...they grabbed me...

586
00:52:38,249 --> 00:52:40,001
...lifted my skirt.

587
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:44,880
One said he wanted to suck me.

588
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,806
-I told him to go suck his mother!
-What did they do to you?

589
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:50,641
-They beat me.
-What else?

590
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:53,524
What else?

591
00:52:53,689 --> 00:52:55,407
-That's all, Deusdete.
-Who was it?

592
00:52:55,569 --> 00:52:56,524
Who was it?

593
00:52:56,689 --> 00:52:59,362
-I just ran off!
-Did you know them?

594
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:08,958
Hey, Zico!

595
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:13,648
Deusdete?

596
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,965
What are you doing here, man?

597
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:17,928
I need to talk.

598
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:34,602
Is Mother all right?

599
00:53:34,889 --> 00:53:36,686
It's not her.

600
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:39,081
Some guys messed with Franci.

601
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:51,888
What did they do to her?

602
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:56,364
Nothing much, she says.
But I reported it to the cops anyway.

603
00:53:56,649 --> 00:54:00,324
The cops?! You think the cops
will do anything?!

604
00:54:00,489 --> 00:54:03,526
The problem is, the guys found out
and now they're after me.

605
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:11,237
-Leave it to me. I'll sort them out.
-No, Zico. Not your way.

606
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:12,958
I want--

607
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:19,403
I just want a gun, to defend myself.

608
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:30,842
Take your pick.

609
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:47,241
Even with a gun, doctor, I never
thought anything would happen.

610
00:54:49,609 --> 00:54:55,206
But it was my destiny,
and theirs, when they found me.

611
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:04,324
So!

612
00:55:05,289 --> 00:55:08,201
-Where's the stool pigeon off to?
-I'm not looking for a fight.

613
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:11,122
-Let me go home.
-Sure thing...

614
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:13,837
...but first we're going to caress you...

615
00:55:14,009 --> 00:55:16,204
...just like we did your little sister.

616
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:51,558
Hey, man!

617
00:57:24,169 --> 00:57:25,761
Give me a Coke.

618
00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:33,837
You know how old I'll be
when I get out of here, doctor?

619
00:57:36,969 --> 00:57:38,402
Forty-eight.

620
00:57:40,129 --> 00:57:41,642
There!

621
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:48,403
One...

622
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:50,808
...two...

623
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:53,404
...three...

624
00:57:54,649 --> 00:57:55,843
...four...

625
00:57:57,009 --> 00:57:58,442
...five...

626
00:57:59,169 --> 00:58:00,397
...six...

627
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:02,723
...seven...

628
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,202
...eight.

629
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:15,482
Found it.

630
00:58:29,129 --> 00:58:30,642
So it's Visitors Day, is it?

631
00:58:32,169 --> 00:58:33,443
If you like...

632
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:35,168
...you can go now.

633
00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:50,363
I've got a problem, I need to talk.

634
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:53,281
This problem got a name?

635
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:55,037
Ezequiel.

636
00:58:55,489 --> 00:58:58,401
He still owes me and now he's
trying to get more on account.

637
00:58:59,489 --> 00:59:02,799
He comes to my cell, raises his voice.
What's he playing at?

638
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,200
-And you?
-Me?

639
00:59:05,929 --> 00:59:08,523
If I don't get paid,
I can't pay Highness.

640
00:59:09,609 --> 00:59:12,043
I want your permission
to kill the bastard.

641
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:15,679
This goes on much longer,
I'll start losing respect around here.

642
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:17,282
Cool it.

643
00:59:18,649 --> 00:59:22,005
I'll tell Ezequiel to get
the money from his family.

644
00:59:22,569 --> 00:59:26,357
If he doesn't pay,
you can go ahead.

645
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:38,484
This man has already lost a lung...

646
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:42,608
-...and the other's in pretty bad shape.
-Take the medicine, man, go on.

647
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:46,564
See, doctor? He won't take it.

648
00:59:47,769 --> 00:59:49,646
What are you, a kid?
You won't get better...

649
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:53,085
-...if you don't take it.
-Come on, that's right.

650
00:59:54,649 --> 00:59:55,638
That's it.

651
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:01,764
Come on.

652
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:04,358
Right.

653
01:00:08,649 --> 01:00:11,721
-Good.
-And on the outside? What did he do?

654
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:14,159
We used to rob armored trucks.

655
01:00:14,329 --> 01:00:18,368
Just the two of us.
We planned everything. Remember?

656
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:21,601
Doctor, we'd spend six months
just gathering information.

657
01:00:21,769 --> 01:00:24,044
We'd even make friends
with the guards' families.

658
01:00:24,209 --> 01:00:25,608
And that paid off?

659
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:29,763
Sure, plenty. Although
we'd only use half the money.

660
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:34,087
The rest we'd put aside
for a rainy day...

661
01:00:34,289 --> 01:00:36,325
...or to bribe the cops.

662
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:50,564
It's coming.

663
01:01:20,529 --> 01:01:21,928
Stop!

664
01:01:24,249 --> 01:01:27,241
You going to sit there
on top of other people's money?

665
01:01:27,409 --> 01:01:29,923
If you don't come out it'll be
too bad for your widows.

666
01:01:30,089 --> 01:01:31,761
Open that door,
for Christ's sake!

667
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:35,528
Come on, get out!

668
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:38,078
So we paid off the others...

669
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:41,127
...and each went his own way
back to the family.

670
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:45,598
So anyway, Antonio,
what's on your mind?

671
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:50,003
Miro...

672
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:53,480
...your wife's cheating on you.

673
01:01:54,809 --> 01:01:56,208
With a cop.

674
01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:02,487
-Says who?
-Says no one. I saw her.

675
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:05,841
They were making out in a squad car.

676
01:02:06,929 --> 01:02:08,806
Near the old bakery.

677
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:20,081
Dina doesn't buy bread there.

678
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:23,480
Miro, I saw her.
And it wasn't bread she was after.

679
01:02:31,249 --> 01:02:32,477
Celia...

680
01:02:33,969 --> 01:02:35,960
...is Antonio Carlos gay?

681
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:39,086
What a question, Dina!

682
01:02:41,769 --> 01:02:46,445
He made up this story and told Miro
I've been going out with a cop.

683
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:50,682
Like hell I made it up.
I saw you crawling all over him.

684
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:55,365
-You nibbled his ear, damn it!
-Then it's me he's really after.

685
01:02:56,089 --> 01:02:58,683
You forgot the best part...

686
01:02:58,929 --> 01:03:02,080
...how you asked me to run away
with you...

687
01:03:02,249 --> 01:03:03,762
...and that I turned you down...

688
01:03:03,929 --> 01:03:05,681
...because I love my husband...

689
01:03:06,009 --> 01:03:07,761
...and your wife's my friend.

690
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:10,208
Liar!

691
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:12,041
Evil slut!

692
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:24,161
Miro, you don't believe that bitch,
do you?

693
01:03:26,249 --> 01:03:29,844
Man, how many jobs have we
pulled off together?

694
01:03:31,169 --> 01:03:33,444
And our agreement!

695
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,919
Celia, see if you can keep your man
around the house.

696
01:03:37,089 --> 01:03:39,683
I don't want him pestering me
in the street anymore.

697
01:03:43,049 --> 01:03:44,277
Miro!

698
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:51,518
-Miro!
-Bastard! You dirty bastard!

699
01:03:51,849 --> 01:03:53,123
You've never fooled me.

700
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:55,757
I always knew you had a crush on her.

701
01:03:55,929 --> 01:03:59,001
You can't even respect your
best friend's wife, you dog!

702
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,966
-Calm down.
-Dog!

703
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,526
Miro, I'm telling you the truth!

704
01:04:16,089 --> 01:04:17,920
I lost my friend and partner.

705
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:21,440
The first robbery without him,
there were so many cops...

706
01:04:21,609 --> 01:04:23,839
...it looked more like a military parade.

707
01:04:24,169 --> 01:04:27,241
-What about him?
-I only found out when he got here.

708
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:30,123
I thought I'd gone to hell, doctor.

709
01:04:30,289 --> 01:04:31,847
But him? I'll tell you.

710
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:33,722
Come here, come on.

711
01:04:34,049 --> 01:04:35,448
Come on.

712
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,444
Miro.

713
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:56,599
Miro, don't you think it's time you quit?

714
01:04:59,209 --> 01:05:02,406
Take what you've got and start
a decent life someplace else?

715
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:03,968
In a new city?

716
01:05:04,289 --> 01:05:07,838
Give the kid a better chance?

717
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,128
Stop! Police!

718
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:38,561
Party's over, Miro.

719
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:41,167
I'll cut you in.

720
01:05:41,529 --> 01:05:45,647
It's cheaper for me to cut you guys in
than give it to a lawyer.

721
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:47,003
You don't get it.

722
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:49,478
We're taking the lot. Everything.

723
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:51,446
Hand it over, the dough.
Come on, quick.

724
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:07,922
Too bad, a smart guy like you
trusting his own wife.

725
01:06:08,569 --> 01:06:11,003
Some guys are born
to be cheated on.

726
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:28,163
Are you all right?

727
01:06:49,609 --> 01:06:50,883
Doctor...

728
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:58,884
...do infants remember
everything we do?

729
01:07:00,529 --> 01:07:03,441
No, not a thing.

730
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:08,362
Doctor, let him go.

731
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:38,927
And with you now...

732
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:42,320
...our untamed diva of dance...

733
01:07:42,569 --> 01:07:45,686
...the woman who lives in all
thieves' hearts...

734
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:50,604
...here at the detention center...

735
01:07:50,769 --> 01:07:55,923
...the one and only Rita Cadillac!

736
01:07:58,289 --> 01:08:00,644
-Rita!
-Rita!

737
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:47,564
Hello!

738
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:50,684
I know you all...

739
01:08:51,209 --> 01:08:54,758
...fool around a lot, right?

740
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:56,482
Yes!

741
01:08:57,449 --> 01:08:59,917
But do you take care
of yourselves?

742
01:09:00,289 --> 01:09:01,563
Yes!

743
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:06,241
Our friend, the doctor,
came here today...

744
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:09,685
...and he's taught me enough
to teach you too, right?

745
01:09:09,849 --> 01:09:11,077
That's right!

746
01:09:11,369 --> 01:09:15,521
Okay, so some of you are
careful and some forget...

747
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:19,045
...so I'm going to teach you what to do.

748
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:32,399
This one's orange!

749
01:10:41,729 --> 01:10:45,119
-Dona Graca, Ebony sent you this.
-Thanks.

750
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:51,647
-Oh, look. My man. Want some?
-No, thank you.

751
01:10:52,049 --> 01:10:54,768
See, Franci?
That's the sort of man I want.

752
01:10:55,089 --> 01:10:58,718
-You think Deusdete will like me?
-That's up to the two of you.

753
01:10:58,889 --> 01:11:02,040
It's easier for him if he has a
sweetheart waiting on the outside.

754
01:11:02,209 --> 01:11:03,244
You're right.

755
01:11:03,409 --> 01:11:06,401
You need a heart full of love
to put up with this life.

756
01:11:06,569 --> 01:11:10,164
Take my boy. He's always
asking about his father.

757
01:11:10,769 --> 01:11:13,283
What did he say when
you told him I was coming?

758
01:11:13,449 --> 01:11:15,804
That you could come,
if you felt like it.

759
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:31,363
Good work, man.

760
01:12:31,169 --> 01:12:36,641
Agenor Barbosa, inmate 15027.
Your brothers Pedro...

761
01:12:36,809 --> 01:12:40,643
...Luiz and Felicio are waiting
for you at the barbershop.

762
01:12:40,809 --> 01:12:44,119
-Deusdete, this is Catarina.
-Hello.

763
01:12:44,289 --> 01:12:45,608
This is me.

764
01:12:47,009 --> 01:12:48,965
Franci's told me a lot about you.

765
01:12:49,649 --> 01:12:50,843
Nothing bad, I hope.

766
01:12:51,089 --> 01:12:52,602
Only the best.

767
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:56,557
She was even a bit jealous when
I said I wanted to meet you, right?

768
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:03,564
Zico.

769
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:06,438
Hi, Franci.

770
01:13:10,769 --> 01:13:12,805
You're so thin.

771
01:13:13,249 --> 01:13:15,922
-Been eating too much junk?
-Sure thing.

772
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:18,763
But that's the least of it, right, Zico?

773
01:13:21,409 --> 01:13:23,877
Son, have you been taking
good care of your brother?

774
01:13:25,929 --> 01:13:27,328
You bet, Godmother.

775
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:29,488
The game's starting...

776
01:13:29,649 --> 01:13:32,607
...the referee blows the whistle
and they're off!

777
01:13:32,769 --> 01:13:35,363
There goes Neto, and he's through...

778
01:13:35,529 --> 01:13:38,327
...to the penalty area, playing
beautifully, passing one player...

779
01:13:38,489 --> 01:13:41,128
...slowly, beautifully,
there he goes...

780
01:13:41,289 --> 01:13:44,759
...dribbling that ball.
And Highness takes a shot!

781
01:13:44,929 --> 01:13:50,242
Inmate Josue "Highness" dos Santos,
section 9302...

782
01:13:50,409 --> 01:13:53,481
...come immediately to the entrance
of Pavilion 9.

783
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:04,478
Darling...

784
01:14:06,289 --> 01:14:08,359
...l'll be right back.

785
01:14:32,449 --> 01:14:33,802
Hi, honey!

786
01:14:38,089 --> 01:14:39,807
Kiss me on the mouth!

787
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:45,638
Come on.

788
01:14:45,809 --> 01:14:50,439
Oh, honey, today is not a good day.

789
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:55,319
You haven't worked a day in your life,
now you tell me you've changed?

790
01:14:55,489 --> 01:14:58,845
-You have to understand--
-You've got that white trash in there.

791
01:14:59,009 --> 01:15:02,365
-No way, I swear!
-Really? So let's go and take a look.

792
01:15:02,529 --> 01:15:05,202
Because I think that white slut
is in there with you!

793
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:07,837
-Cut it out, honey.
-I'll show you!

794
01:15:17,049 --> 01:15:21,247
Do you think I'm stupid, an idiot?
I know she's in there!

795
01:15:21,409 --> 01:15:23,525
What are you looking at?

796
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:28,358
There!

797
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:31,407
I just knew you were with that whore.

798
01:15:31,809 --> 01:15:33,606
Oh, so now I'm the whore, am I?

799
01:15:33,769 --> 01:15:36,158
-Listen!
-Stop, stop!

800
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:38,922
Let's all sit down.

801
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:40,643
Sit down, Dalva.

802
01:15:41,049 --> 01:15:42,562
Sit down, please.

803
01:15:43,849 --> 01:15:45,840
Rosirene, sit down.

804
01:15:46,529 --> 01:15:48,838
Rosirene, sit down.

805
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:58,759
Right, now you're here,
there's no turning back.

806
01:15:59,129 --> 01:16:01,962
The three of us are going
to come to an agreement.

807
01:16:02,289 --> 01:16:05,406
Rosirene, Dalva's no whore, all right?

808
01:16:05,569 --> 01:16:09,323
She works at the textile factory
and raises our kids.

809
01:16:09,489 --> 01:16:11,525
They're my kids, damn it!

810
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:20,567
And you too. You said Rosirene's
worthless, and that's not true either.

811
01:16:20,729 --> 01:16:24,927
If it weren't for her bringing me
some decent stuff to sell in here...

812
01:16:25,089 --> 01:16:28,559
...we'd all be going hungry.

813
01:16:31,089 --> 01:16:32,966
If you like both of us...

814
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:35,878
-...that's your problem.
-Oh, Jesus!

815
01:16:36,289 --> 01:16:42,000
Yeah, Highness. You're going to have
to choose between us right now.

816
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:45,601
Damn right.

817
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:56,158
Shit. You're breaking my heart
in two, damn it!

818
01:17:04,969 --> 01:17:06,402
Two women, doctor!

819
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:09,483
What do these crooks have
that we haven't?

820
01:17:10,169 --> 01:17:14,401
-Have you kissed your wife today?
-No, why?

821
01:17:15,849 --> 01:17:17,282
I rest my case.

822
01:17:29,769 --> 01:17:31,487
Can I join you?

823
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:45,128
So. Nothing to tell?

824
01:17:46,489 --> 01:17:49,287
You're the one who never told us
what happened that day.

825
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:51,567
That's ancient history, Zico.

826
01:17:53,609 --> 01:17:55,998
You never told me
what they did to you.

827
01:18:12,649 --> 01:18:16,562
When you get out of here,
promise me you'll let your hair grow?

828
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:23,040
You believe in promises?

829
01:18:28,169 --> 01:18:30,558
Deusdete was right...

830
01:18:31,049 --> 01:18:33,438
...you're not the Zico we used to know.

831
01:19:02,329 --> 01:19:03,523
Anyone home?

832
01:19:05,289 --> 01:19:07,678
What's up, Dagger?

833
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:12,919
I've got a message for a friend.

834
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:14,404
I know.

835
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:08,326
What's that look on your face?

836
01:20:09,609 --> 01:20:12,965
I pretended I had AIDS
so they'd leave me alone...

837
01:20:13,289 --> 01:20:15,041
...but it was no use.

838
01:20:15,529 --> 01:20:18,362
The bastard who did me is infected.

839
01:20:18,649 --> 01:20:22,403
Forget it, kid. He told me
to tell you he lied too.

840
01:20:22,729 --> 01:20:24,640
He hasn't got AIDS either.

841
01:20:31,049 --> 01:20:32,004
What is it?

842
01:20:32,489 --> 01:20:34,207
Ezequiel wants to pay.

843
01:20:34,609 --> 01:20:36,361
You don't owe me anything, man.

844
01:20:37,849 --> 01:20:40,647
Ezequiel spoke to her
and she said yes.

845
01:20:44,409 --> 01:20:45,683
I don't get it.

846
01:20:46,089 --> 01:20:48,319
Ezequiel wants to pay with her.

847
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:50,645
Ezequiel's sister sleeps
with some of the guys...

848
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:52,845
...raises some cash
and pays the debt with Zico.

849
01:20:55,329 --> 01:20:57,604
Ezequiel has no other possessions.

850
01:21:02,849 --> 01:21:05,079
Do whatever you think is best.

851
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:14,802
I was blind.

852
01:21:15,289 --> 01:21:17,359
I was blind, I believed her.

853
01:21:19,489 --> 01:21:20,888
Will you ever...

854
01:21:22,089 --> 01:21:24,080
...be able to trust me again?

855
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:27,961
I never stopped trusting you.

856
01:21:35,969 --> 01:21:38,085
He's our family now.

857
01:21:44,409 --> 01:21:46,604
-Let's sing " Happy Birthday" !
-Shall we?

858
01:21:46,849 --> 01:21:48,328
Here, sit on my lap.

859
01:21:48,489 --> 01:21:50,878
One, two, three.

860
01:21:51,049 --> 01:21:55,486
Happy birthday to you

861
01:21:55,649 --> 01:22:00,325
Happy birthday to you

862
01:22:01,329 --> 01:22:04,048
Sir, we're in love.

863
01:22:04,609 --> 01:22:07,601
Lady and I would like your blessing.

864
01:22:08,009 --> 01:22:09,362
It's Dirceu.

865
01:22:09,609 --> 01:22:11,520
His name is Dirceu.

866
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:18,005
Son, do you believe in him?

867
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:23,366
Mother, I've never met anyone
like Matias.

868
01:22:25,009 --> 01:22:27,239
I don't get this kid.

869
01:22:33,809 --> 01:22:36,960
We're too old to know what's right,
Antonio.

870
01:22:37,769 --> 01:22:41,318
If it's what Dirceu wants,
what's the harm?

871
01:22:42,369 --> 01:22:45,839
In here they can get up to all
the disgusting things they live.

872
01:22:52,249 --> 01:22:53,602
Son.

873
01:22:57,169 --> 01:22:58,363
Goodbye.

874
01:23:00,569 --> 01:23:04,164
Your attention, please.
Visitors Day is almost over...

875
01:23:04,569 --> 01:23:07,845
...so will family members please
go to the exit.

876
01:23:08,009 --> 01:23:10,728
The gates will close in 10 minutes.

877
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:15,042
Excuse me, doctor.

878
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:16,802
This is my boy.

879
01:23:17,289 --> 01:23:21,043
I know he's done wrong,
but when I think of him...

880
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:24,007
...I can't believe he took
someone's life.

881
01:23:24,169 --> 01:23:26,842
I wanted to ask you to keep
an eye on Davilson for me.

882
01:23:27,009 --> 01:23:29,477
I can't look after him in here.

883
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:33,047
-Come and see me at the infirmary.
-Yes, sir.

884
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:35,165
Thank you, doctor.

885
01:24:08,169 --> 01:24:10,922
So can I come back next time?

886
01:24:12,409 --> 01:24:14,286
If you think it's worth it.

887
01:24:15,089 --> 01:24:17,239
It'll be so long before I get out.

888
01:24:23,849 --> 01:24:25,646
I'm in no hurry.

889
01:24:38,529 --> 01:24:42,238
Mr. Pires, his body was already
hanging here when we woke up.

890
01:24:50,609 --> 01:24:53,123
This one won't be raping anyone else.

891
01:25:09,769 --> 01:25:12,363
The doctor said it
should read positive.

892
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:15,680
No! Positive means you've
got it in your blood.

893
01:25:16,409 --> 01:25:18,047
It has to be negative.

894
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:21,881
HIV-negative.

895
01:25:26,729 --> 01:25:28,128
I'll go first.

896
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,642
My case is more desperate.

897
01:25:41,889 --> 01:25:43,208
I'm clean!

898
01:25:46,249 --> 01:25:47,568
I'm clean!

899
01:25:58,409 --> 01:26:02,084
Well, you've had your fun.

900
01:26:02,249 --> 01:26:05,082
You've had over 2000 men
and you're clean.

901
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:09,198
And me, as square as they come?
It's just too bad.

902
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:18,245
I'm clean too, Lady.

903
01:26:29,249 --> 01:26:30,568
What's wrong?

904
01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:44,358
They're letting me out, Lady.

905
01:26:52,089 --> 01:26:53,602
So why aren't you happy?

906
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:56,608
And leave you here?

907
01:26:57,209 --> 01:26:58,244
All alone?

908
01:27:00,689 --> 01:27:01,883
I'm not alone.

909
01:27:13,569 --> 01:27:15,287
I have you.

910
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:33,281
No one works for me
who can't be trusted.

911
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:35,838
You ask permission to kill,
then change your mind?

912
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:39,445
But Ebony, I'll be out in two years.

913
01:27:39,609 --> 01:27:43,522
Better keep quiet and settle the score
on the outside, right?

914
01:27:43,769 --> 01:27:45,202
Ezequiel...

915
01:27:46,249 --> 01:27:48,001
...you owed and didn't pay.

916
01:27:49,129 --> 01:27:51,518
You're alive, but you can't stay here.

917
01:27:52,169 --> 01:27:54,842
Get your things and go
to the yellow wing.

918
01:27:57,449 --> 01:28:01,158
As for you, Zico, you're no criminal.

919
01:28:01,689 --> 01:28:03,327
You're a clown.

920
01:28:45,889 --> 01:28:47,447
It's all right, doctor.

921
01:28:48,009 --> 01:28:49,442
So many years locked up...

922
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:53,404
...the mind learns to control the body.

923
01:29:12,449 --> 01:29:14,440
Chico, how come you're in here?

924
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:17,279
Oh, doctor, you want to hear
yet another lie?

925
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:21,125
No one in here is really guilty,
haven't you noticed?

926
01:29:22,569 --> 01:29:26,642
-Much longer to go?
-I should have been out long ago.

927
01:29:26,809 --> 01:29:30,768
It's in the hands of the judge.
Oh, doctor, I can't wait.

928
01:29:30,929 --> 01:29:33,489
Best thing about jail is getting out.

929
01:29:33,649 --> 01:29:35,162
And leave behind all your friends?

930
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:37,797
Friends?
I don't want inmates for friends.

931
01:29:37,969 --> 01:29:41,518
I finish talking to you,
close the door and that's that.

932
01:29:41,689 --> 01:29:44,362
In here you have to walk alone...

933
01:29:44,529 --> 01:29:47,521
...or maybe with God.

934
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:51,439
What about your daughter?

935
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,447
What are you thinking, Chico?

936
01:30:00,489 --> 01:30:04,482
I was imagining these two...

937
01:30:05,129 --> 01:30:08,485
...flying up...

938
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:10,560
...higher into the sky.

939
01:30:26,009 --> 01:30:27,237
It's weird.

940
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:31,321
This is weird!

941
01:30:36,289 --> 01:30:37,483
Weird.

942
01:30:43,369 --> 01:30:44,927
Come out, you son of a bitch.

943
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:48,245
Come out!

944
01:30:53,809 --> 01:30:55,242
What can you see?

945
01:30:55,649 --> 01:30:57,321
It's trying to stab me in the eye!

946
01:31:04,049 --> 01:31:06,483
Want to stab me?

947
01:31:06,929 --> 01:31:08,282
Son of a bitch!

948
01:31:12,929 --> 01:31:14,044
There's no one there, man.

949
01:31:14,209 --> 01:31:17,087
There's no one there.
What's wrong, man? It's me!

950
01:31:17,249 --> 01:31:21,037
Jesus, brother, you're too crazy, Zico.
It's me, man!

951
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:23,165
Give me the knife.

952
01:31:23,409 --> 01:31:24,922
Give me the knife.

953
01:31:26,769 --> 01:31:28,327
Give me the knife.

954
01:31:28,489 --> 01:31:30,241
Get a grip, Zico.

955
01:31:30,409 --> 01:31:32,001
You're trying to get yourself killed?

956
01:31:41,169 --> 01:31:42,682
Stop smoking, Zico.

957
01:31:44,649 --> 01:31:46,241
Stop smoking, man.

958
01:31:47,049 --> 01:31:49,688
I don't want that shit in here anymore!

959
01:32:04,289 --> 01:32:07,008
So, Mr. Pires, shall I go
and fetch the old man?

960
01:32:07,249 --> 01:32:09,240
No, let him be.

961
01:33:11,409 --> 01:33:16,403
When I went to visit Zico, Deusdete
didn't let us do crack in there.

962
01:33:16,569 --> 01:33:19,925
-That's no reason to kill!
-I was scared shitless.

963
01:33:20,089 --> 01:33:24,526
-Went to bed and woke up burned.
-How dare he kill without asking us?

964
01:33:24,689 --> 01:33:27,362
Mind your own business.

965
01:33:27,529 --> 01:33:29,326
He was a childhood friend.

966
01:33:29,489 --> 01:33:32,959
If you had a friend to advise you,
would you have done the same thing?

967
01:33:33,449 --> 01:33:34,848
That's their problem.

968
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:36,882
You're wrong.

969
01:33:37,249 --> 01:33:39,319
Now it's our problem.

970
01:33:41,049 --> 01:33:42,198
Here she comes!

971
01:34:27,489 --> 01:34:29,445
Too Bad, honey...

972
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:32,922
...do you take Lady as your true wife?

973
01:34:33,769 --> 01:34:34,758
Yes.

974
01:34:38,569 --> 01:34:39,968
And do you, Lady...

975
01:34:40,569 --> 01:34:43,208
...take Too Bad as your husband?

976
01:34:45,569 --> 01:34:46,558
I do.

977
01:34:51,609 --> 01:34:54,567
Then, as the presiding queen,
I hereby declare you...

978
01:34:54,849 --> 01:34:57,522
...man and wife!

979
01:35:17,929 --> 01:35:18,918
Kiss!

980
01:35:19,089 --> 01:35:20,238
Kiss!

981
01:35:20,649 --> 01:35:23,288
-Kiss!
-First, I want to propose a toast.

982
01:35:23,529 --> 01:35:24,757
To the doctor!

983
01:35:27,929 --> 01:35:31,205
Because thanks to all the
medicine this gentleman...

984
01:35:31,369 --> 01:35:34,361
...has taught me, I'm going out
to open my own clinic.

985
01:35:37,769 --> 01:35:40,237
While I wait for you, my beauty...

986
01:35:41,289 --> 01:35:43,928
...so we can start our own family.

987
01:35:47,489 --> 01:35:49,445
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

988
01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:51,679
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

989
01:36:15,769 --> 01:36:16,918
Highness...

990
01:36:18,249 --> 01:36:20,126
...can't I have some on account?

991
01:36:21,409 --> 01:36:22,603
What the fuck?!

992
01:36:24,849 --> 01:36:25,918
Son of a bitch!

993
01:37:09,769 --> 01:37:11,043
Jesus, he chickened out.

994
01:37:15,929 --> 01:37:17,044
Ezequiel.

995
01:37:18,369 --> 01:37:19,848
Come here.

996
01:37:21,689 --> 01:37:23,042
Come here, Ezequiel!

997
01:37:44,649 --> 01:37:48,927
Hey, Ezequiel, you think
that bastard Zico...

998
01:37:49,089 --> 01:37:51,762
...is to blame for all your misery, right?

999
01:37:52,929 --> 01:37:53,918
Sure...

1000
01:37:55,049 --> 01:37:58,803
...but Ezequiel's life has
always been miserable.

1001
01:38:00,009 --> 01:38:02,523
And wasn't it Zico
who made Ezequiel...

1002
01:38:02,689 --> 01:38:05,761
...offer his sister for the drugs?

1003
01:38:05,929 --> 01:38:09,001
Sure, what was I supposed to do?

1004
01:38:10,809 --> 01:38:12,561
So forget it.

1005
01:38:13,129 --> 01:38:14,721
You did it.

1006
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,005
Ezequiel stabbed Zico...

1007
01:38:17,169 --> 01:38:19,046
...over 30 times.

1008
01:38:21,009 --> 01:38:22,488
But Highness...

1009
01:38:24,329 --> 01:38:27,082
...Ezequiel will be out
in just two years.

1010
01:38:28,169 --> 01:38:32,162
-lf I do that, I'll get another 20!
-Two years, 20 years...

1011
01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:35,719
...what's the difference to Ezequiel?
Ezequiel has AIDS.

1012
01:38:36,609 --> 01:38:40,488
At least you'll get a cell to yourself...

1013
01:38:40,649 --> 01:38:42,401
...laundry...

1014
01:38:42,569 --> 01:38:45,208
...and, of course, crack to smoke.

1015
01:39:20,089 --> 01:39:21,761
I was the one who wiped out Zico.

1016
01:39:23,849 --> 01:39:26,158
Now I don't owe anyone a thing.

1017
01:39:52,809 --> 01:39:54,003
Bye, Chico!

1018
01:39:57,009 --> 01:39:58,203
Have faith!

1019
01:40:00,249 --> 01:40:01,398
Go in peace!

1020
01:40:06,249 --> 01:40:07,648
See you.

1021
01:40:10,169 --> 01:40:11,602
Good luck, Chico!

1022
01:40:32,369 --> 01:40:33,404
Old man?

1023
01:40:35,329 --> 01:40:36,648
Go in peace.

1024
01:40:38,609 --> 01:40:40,361
Keep it.

1025
01:40:40,609 --> 01:40:43,442
You need all the peace
you can get in there.

1026
01:41:04,609 --> 01:41:06,406
Why didn't you knife me?

1027
01:41:09,969 --> 01:41:12,358
I couldn't. What about him?

1028
01:41:13,489 --> 01:41:14,683
He won't leave me alone.

1029
01:41:16,129 --> 01:41:17,687
Follows me everywhere.

1030
01:41:18,049 --> 01:41:21,359
So, Zico, up in heaven,
did you meet anyone?

1031
01:41:21,529 --> 01:41:24,407
No one you know, just him.

1032
01:41:26,169 --> 01:41:29,366
No, Zico, what about God?

1033
01:41:33,689 --> 01:41:37,398
Not God in person.
I haven't seen him yet.

1034
01:42:24,729 --> 01:42:25,718
What's wrong?

1035
01:42:26,889 --> 01:42:31,599
Doctor, how can you tell whether
you're going mad?

1036
01:42:33,089 --> 01:42:38,209
Zico came back to haunt me
because I couldn't kill him.

1037
01:42:38,449 --> 01:42:41,839
You been seeing ghosts, Dagger?

1038
01:42:42,009 --> 01:42:44,125
A guy like me...

1039
01:42:45,169 --> 01:42:47,478
...unable to kill?

1040
01:42:48,129 --> 01:42:50,802
Never happened before!

1041
01:42:51,609 --> 01:42:53,884
Isn't that a good thing?

1042
01:42:54,049 --> 01:42:55,926
I only know how to kill.

1043
01:42:57,569 --> 01:42:58,922
That's how I grew up.

1044
01:43:00,209 --> 01:43:02,040
We change, Dagger.

1045
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:03,244
Doctor...

1046
01:43:04,249 --> 01:43:07,002
...I have to know what's
happening to me.

1047
01:43:07,809 --> 01:43:09,765
Am I no longer myself?

1048
01:43:11,289 --> 01:43:14,361
Maybe it's your guilt over having
killed so many.

1049
01:43:18,489 --> 01:43:19,763
Doctor...

1050
01:43:22,649 --> 01:43:25,038
...is there a cure for guilt?

1051
01:43:29,689 --> 01:43:32,681
If there were,
everyone would want some.

1052
01:44:23,929 --> 01:44:24,998
Father.

1053
01:45:11,929 --> 01:45:13,521
Enter, brother.

1054
01:45:16,089 --> 01:45:17,522
Come!

1055
01:45:19,889 --> 01:45:20,878
Come!

1056
01:45:21,409 --> 01:45:24,287
Did you know the Lord
has a plan for you?

1057
01:45:25,849 --> 01:45:26,998
Enter!

1058
01:45:27,169 --> 01:45:28,966
This is your home.

1059
01:45:33,049 --> 01:45:34,482
You're lost, brother.

1060
01:45:34,849 --> 01:45:38,125
You don't know it,
but it was he who brought you here.

1061
01:45:40,569 --> 01:45:43,129
-Who, Father?
-Jesus!

1062
01:45:43,969 --> 01:45:47,405
He knows you can't sleep
if you haven't harmed someone...

1063
01:45:47,569 --> 01:45:51,926
...that you have sleepless nights
unless you've thrown a man down.

1064
01:45:52,089 --> 01:45:56,844
Isn't that what it's like every day,
brother? Come on, isn't it?

1065
01:45:57,009 --> 01:45:58,158
Yes, Father!

1066
01:45:59,729 --> 01:46:01,048
Yes, it is!

1067
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:04,762
There is so much blood on me,
Father!

1068
01:46:04,929 --> 01:46:07,124
So, brother, kneel down.

1069
01:46:07,289 --> 01:46:09,280
Come on, kneel down!

1070
01:46:09,449 --> 01:46:11,485
Will you accept Jesus?

1071
01:46:11,649 --> 01:46:15,039
Will you accept Jesus? Will you?

1072
01:46:15,209 --> 01:46:18,007
Well, brother, will you accept Jesus?!

1073
01:46:21,369 --> 01:46:23,678
Which of you has accepted Jesus?

1074
01:46:23,849 --> 01:46:25,680
-I have!
-I have!

1075
01:46:25,849 --> 01:46:26,964
Hallelujah!

1076
01:46:27,129 --> 01:46:28,323
Hallelujah!

1077
01:46:32,889 --> 01:46:36,643
Criminals of Brazil,
the big day is here:

1078
01:46:36,929 --> 01:46:40,285
The Pavilion 9 finals!

1079
01:46:40,449 --> 01:46:45,045
Marsh going for the trophy
with Valiant, Samuel, Dada, Saint...

1080
01:46:45,209 --> 01:46:48,246
...Indian Boa Ventura,
Minimum Wage, Valdir...

1081
01:46:48,409 --> 01:46:51,401
...AR15, Hildo, Ribeiro and Gerere!

1082
01:46:53,969 --> 01:46:59,327
Tornado 2000 is here with Little Eye,
Sleeve, White Feather, Gringo...

1083
01:46:59,489 --> 01:47:03,402
...Salomao Ayala, Eddie Murphy,
Greenhouse Joe, Zelao...

1084
01:47:03,569 --> 01:47:06,879
...Flavinho, Ebony 10 and Tafarel!

1085
01:49:00,409 --> 01:49:05,529
To kick off this glorious sporting
event, none other than our healer...

1086
01:49:05,689 --> 01:49:10,809
...the wizard of medical alchemy
and official trainer of the criminals!

1087
01:49:24,889 --> 01:49:26,481
And they're off!

1088
01:49:26,649 --> 01:49:28,719
Saint passes to AR15,
Dada covering him.

1089
01:49:28,889 --> 01:49:33,360
Marsh on the attack!
Forcing the ball back...

1090
01:49:33,529 --> 01:49:36,248
...into the hands of Tafarel!

1091
01:49:36,529 --> 01:49:40,886
Up goes the ball! And it's out.

1092
01:49:42,809 --> 01:49:44,367
This is one fast kick.

1093
01:49:45,009 --> 01:49:46,965
Eddie Murphy gets the ball...

1094
01:49:47,129 --> 01:49:49,927
...and they go on the attack.

1095
01:49:50,529 --> 01:49:54,158
They go onto the opposite field.
Capote blocks.

1096
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:57,044
Hello.

1097
01:49:58,289 --> 01:50:01,008
-So, Beard, you all right?
-Couldn't be better.

1098
01:50:01,169 --> 01:50:02,761
Have a good weekend.

1099
01:50:04,089 --> 01:50:08,401
Unfortunately, the Beard was wrong.
He needed some of Chico's wisdom...

1100
01:50:08,569 --> 01:50:13,006
...who once said to me.:
"A quiet, obedient jail?

1101
01:50:13,169 --> 01:50:15,524
Sure sign of trouble. "

1102
01:50:16,209 --> 01:50:19,121
Two weeks later,
when I got back...

1103
01:50:19,289 --> 01:50:22,918
... there were nothing but bullet holes
covering the walls.

1104
01:50:28,009 --> 01:50:29,920
Hey, you!

1105
01:50:30,089 --> 01:50:32,557
-Go find your own line.
-I'll use this one.

1106
01:50:36,409 --> 01:50:37,524
Go away!

1107
01:50:42,929 --> 01:50:45,363
-Are you crazy, man?!
-Let me dry my clothes!

1108
01:50:45,529 --> 01:50:48,680
-You've got some nerve, man!
-What's it got to do with you?

1109
01:50:48,889 --> 01:50:50,607
Stop!

1110
01:50:51,049 --> 01:50:53,085
Stop or I'll shoot!

1111
01:50:54,449 --> 01:50:57,486
Some say it started because of
a debt for five packs of cigarettes.

1112
01:50:57,849 --> 01:51:00,921
Others say that it was a fight
over the soccer game.

1113
01:51:01,569 --> 01:51:04,800
One or two say it was about
a pair of underpants.

1114
01:51:04,969 --> 01:51:07,324
Like they say:

1115
01:51:07,489 --> 01:51:09,480
"Jail's no home for the truth."

1116
01:51:13,369 --> 01:51:15,280
And Dada's down, it's a penalty!

1117
01:51:22,649 --> 01:51:25,083
Dada's taking the penalty himself.

1118
01:51:25,249 --> 01:51:27,888
Getting ready...

1119
01:51:29,049 --> 01:51:30,277
...concentrating.
Go on, Dada!

1120
01:51:33,449 --> 01:51:36,088
Goal!

1121
01:51:36,249 --> 01:51:41,118
Mangue wins!
Dada's touched.

1122
01:51:45,689 --> 01:51:46,838
Jesus Christ!

1123
01:51:47,609 --> 01:51:50,601
-Let your head--
-Watch out, Rabbit's gang is coming.

1124
01:51:54,009 --> 01:51:57,046
-Just look what you did to him.
-Greedy bastard!

1125
01:51:57,209 --> 01:52:01,122
-You could have used your hand, man!
-Just over a pair of underpants!

1126
01:52:01,289 --> 01:52:02,324
What's wrong with you?

1127
01:52:02,489 --> 01:52:03,808
-Wait!
-Let me go!

1128
01:52:03,969 --> 01:52:07,279
-Why couldn't you have waited?
-What's it got to do with you?

1129
01:52:07,449 --> 01:52:09,201
-Stop it!
-Wait!

1130
01:52:09,569 --> 01:52:12,003
-What is it, man?
-Go fuck yourself, damn it!

1131
01:52:17,169 --> 01:52:18,807
We're the champions!

1132
01:52:19,289 --> 01:52:21,598
We're the champions!

1133
01:52:22,409 --> 01:52:24,969
We're the champions!

1134
01:52:30,489 --> 01:52:31,604
Yeah, yeah!

1135
01:52:35,169 --> 01:52:36,761
I was scared, doctor.

1136
01:52:37,529 --> 01:52:39,440
All hell broke loose...

1137
01:52:39,769 --> 01:52:43,079
...and when the blood boils,
criminals lose all control.

1138
01:52:43,649 --> 01:52:48,200
With the confusion, I could
easily have gotten hurt badly.

1139
01:52:56,289 --> 01:52:58,041
Riot in 9!

1140
01:52:58,289 --> 01:53:00,883
The place is ours!

1141
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:05,204
Forget it, let them die if they
want. Let's get to our cell!

1142
01:53:16,089 --> 01:53:17,363
The war's started!

1143
01:53:18,009 --> 01:53:19,328
The war's started!

1144
01:53:19,489 --> 01:53:20,842
The war's started!

1145
01:53:39,569 --> 01:53:41,127
War! Let's torch the place!

1146
01:54:01,049 --> 01:54:05,281
Another explosion in the
overcrowded Detention Center...

1147
01:54:05,449 --> 01:54:07,758
...which is the biggest
in Latin America...

1148
01:54:07,929 --> 01:54:10,159
... with a total capacity
of 4000 inmates.

1149
01:54:10,329 --> 01:54:14,163
Only, nowadays it's more crowded
than ever...

1150
01:54:14,329 --> 01:54:16,479
...with 7500 prisoners!

1151
01:54:17,209 --> 01:54:21,566
The riot squad has been called
and is storming the jail...

1152
01:54:21,729 --> 01:54:25,802
... with over 300 men with rev olvers,
machine guns and tear gas.

1153
01:54:26,009 --> 01:54:28,603
By then, no one could
hear a damn thing.

1154
01:54:28,769 --> 01:54:34,082
Through the bars we could see
a bunch of masked cops.

1155
01:54:34,249 --> 01:54:38,401
All you could see was their eyes,
the dogs, machine guns...

1156
01:54:38,569 --> 01:54:41,367
...and a helicopter flying real low,
pointing a machine gun at us.

1157
01:55:39,489 --> 01:55:41,207
Certainly, sir, right away!

1158
01:55:41,689 --> 01:55:43,805
Orders from the governor.

1159
01:55:44,089 --> 01:55:48,241
-You're in charge now, colonel.
-The troops will do what's necessary.

1160
01:55:48,409 --> 01:55:49,888
You're an experienced man.

1161
01:55:50,049 --> 01:55:54,201
-lf you need to move in, go ahead.
-No, he can't! This is my jail!

1162
01:55:58,329 --> 01:56:00,081
Squad, attention!

1163
01:56:00,729 --> 01:56:03,846
Pay attention, men!
Return to your cells!

1164
01:56:04,449 --> 01:56:07,202
Back to your cells,
otherwise the cops are coming in!

1165
01:56:07,369 --> 01:56:09,519
If they come in here, they'll all die!

1166
01:56:09,689 --> 01:56:14,046
Mr. Pires, plenty of men should
have been released by now!

1167
01:56:14,369 --> 01:56:18,601
We want better conditions!

1168
01:56:18,769 --> 01:56:21,044
Mr. Pires, send the riot squad away!

1169
01:56:21,209 --> 01:56:23,279
Go back to your cells!

1170
01:56:23,449 --> 01:56:26,282
Everyone back to his cell
or you'll regret it!

1171
01:56:26,449 --> 01:56:28,440
No regrets in here!

1172
01:56:28,609 --> 01:56:30,327
How many hostages do you have?

1173
01:56:30,649 --> 01:56:32,799
Are there hostages in there?

1174
01:56:32,969 --> 01:56:35,085
We're no hostages, Mr. Pires!

1175
01:56:35,289 --> 01:56:37,439
This is our fight, Mr. Pires!

1176
01:56:38,169 --> 01:56:39,363
See, colonel?

1177
01:56:39,529 --> 01:56:43,568
They've no hostages, no water,
no electricity. They'll give in soon.

1178
01:56:43,729 --> 01:56:46,323
Save us, Mr. Pires!
Don't let them come in here.

1179
01:56:46,489 --> 01:56:48,081
Send the riot squad away!

1180
01:56:48,249 --> 01:56:50,479
I'm having a tough time
holding them back!

1181
01:56:50,649 --> 01:56:52,401
Let's keep calm!

1182
01:56:52,569 --> 01:56:54,446
Let's keep calm!

1183
01:56:54,609 --> 01:56:56,406
Now, hand over your weapons!

1184
01:56:56,569 --> 01:56:58,560
Surrender your weapons!

1185
01:57:38,409 --> 01:57:42,721
See, colonel? Everything's calm.
You can send them away.

1186
01:57:44,129 --> 01:57:48,042
Pay attention!
Everyone back to your cells!

1187
01:57:48,289 --> 01:57:50,962
Return to your cells!

1188
01:57:51,929 --> 01:57:53,726
Let's stay calm!

1189
01:57:54,489 --> 01:57:57,287
Back to your cells!

1190
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:06,243
With an election coming up, the
governor wouldn't let the jail explode.

1191
01:58:12,569 --> 01:58:13,684
Go on, get in!

1192
01:58:54,249 --> 01:58:55,238
You!

1193
01:58:56,049 --> 01:58:58,199
Show us the way, let's go!

1194
01:59:06,969 --> 01:59:11,247
We may be a bunch of ignorant
thieves and murderers...

1195
01:59:11,409 --> 01:59:13,206
...but we're not stupid.

1196
01:59:13,889 --> 01:59:15,481
No one wants to die.

1197
01:59:16,009 --> 01:59:19,126
As they came in,
we ran to our cells.

1198
01:59:19,289 --> 01:59:22,326
We couldn't put up a fight
with knives and sticks.

1199
01:59:35,769 --> 01:59:39,159
Go back, I'm warning you!
We've got AIDS! You're gonna die!

1200
01:59:44,169 --> 01:59:48,560
They came in to kill us, doctor,
shouting we all had AIDS...

1201
01:59:48,929 --> 01:59:51,363
...that they'd catch it
if they touched us.

1202
02:00:21,369 --> 02:00:22,643
Turn right!

1203
02:00:22,969 --> 02:00:24,402
And left!

1204
02:00:29,409 --> 02:00:30,637
Hey, get out!

1205
02:00:30,809 --> 02:00:32,720
I want to stay with you!

1206
02:02:01,809 --> 02:02:04,846
Sergeant, let's play
cops and robbers.

1207
02:02:43,889 --> 02:02:46,642
You're going to live
to tell the tale.

1208
02:02:58,529 --> 02:02:59,678
I changed my mind.

1209
02:03:25,489 --> 02:03:28,799
Like hell he changed his mind!
It was pure spite.

1210
02:03:28,969 --> 02:03:32,723
He fed Ezequiel a glimmer of hope
so he could come back and kill him.

1211
02:03:36,329 --> 02:03:38,001
You two been causing trouble?

1212
02:03:38,169 --> 02:03:41,764
No way, we're sports fans.

1213
02:03:50,849 --> 02:03:54,080
So, you thief, how do you like
some of your own medicine?

1214
02:03:54,249 --> 02:03:55,921
You got lucky this time.

1215
02:04:43,449 --> 02:04:44,723
Who knows?

1216
02:04:45,329 --> 02:04:47,923
I guess he didn't have the courage
to shoot a woman.

1217
02:04:48,169 --> 02:04:50,160
It was our love that saved us.

1218
02:05:01,049 --> 02:05:04,166
It was the cop's son
who saved my life.

1219
02:05:04,769 --> 02:05:06,919
God bless the cop's son.

1220
02:05:07,089 --> 02:05:09,683
God bless that cop's son!

1221
02:05:09,889 --> 02:05:12,084
I'm unarmed!

1222
02:05:12,249 --> 02:05:13,682
Out of your cell!

1223
02:05:14,969 --> 02:05:16,402
Put your hands on the wall!

1224
02:05:16,729 --> 02:05:20,119
-I know you killed a cop!
-I never killed anyone, sir!

1225
02:05:20,289 --> 02:05:23,326
I'm only in for three years.
Spare me! Spare me!

1226
02:05:23,689 --> 02:05:26,965
Listen here. The only reason
this is your lucky day...

1227
02:05:27,129 --> 02:05:29,597
...is because you look like my son.

1228
02:07:10,489 --> 02:07:12,878
Anyone alive, undress
and come out naked!

1229
02:07:13,129 --> 02:07:15,484
Anyone alive, undress
and come out naked!

1230
02:07:16,249 --> 02:07:18,638
Anyone alive, undress
and come out naked!

1231
02:07:29,409 --> 02:07:32,162
I want to hear you say:
" Long live the riot squad!"

1232
02:07:32,329 --> 02:07:35,287
Go on! " Long live the riot squad!"

1233
02:07:35,929 --> 02:07:37,726
Louder, you murderer!

1234
02:07:38,009 --> 02:07:39,408
Long live the riot squad!

1235
02:07:39,769 --> 02:07:41,043
Long live the riot squad!

1236
02:07:41,529 --> 02:07:44,123
Everyone, now!
Long live the riot squad!

1237
02:07:44,289 --> 02:07:45,608
Long live the riot squad!

1238
02:07:45,769 --> 02:07:46,997
Long live the riot squad!

1239
02:07:47,169 --> 02:07:48,522
Long live the riot squad!

1240
02:07:54,969 --> 02:07:55,924
Go on!

1241
02:07:59,729 --> 02:08:00,878
Move it, come on!

1242
02:08:02,329 --> 02:08:05,287
-There's no one alive inside!
-Let's go, then!

1243
02:08:10,449 --> 02:08:11,723
Undress, everything! Come on!

1244
02:08:12,409 --> 02:08:13,922
Undress, everything!

1245
02:08:14,289 --> 02:08:16,439
-Undress!
-Heads down!

1246
02:11:00,049 --> 02:11:02,040
" Davilson, dearest son...

1247
02:11:03,289 --> 02:11:07,077
...your mother weeps when she thinks
of you when you were little...

1248
02:11:08,129 --> 02:11:10,643
...laughing deep into my eyes.

1249
02:11:12,129 --> 02:11:14,882
I know you never
believed in my God...

1250
02:11:15,369 --> 02:11:18,122
...but today, as I read the Bible...

1251
02:11:18,289 --> 02:11:21,486
...it was as if you were here
in my lap again.

1252
02:11:22,329 --> 02:11:26,527
My heart trembled as
I read Psalm 91.

1253
02:11:27,729 --> 02:11:30,118
What beautiful words.

1254
02:11:32,529 --> 02:11:37,045
A thousand may fall
at your right hand...

1255
02:11:37,929 --> 02:11:40,397
...but no evil will come near you...

1256
02:11:41,769 --> 02:11:44,124
...no scourge come near your tent."

1257
02:12:27,929 --> 02:12:33,003
In the late '80s, AIDS
prevention work in jails...

1258
02:12:33,169 --> 02:12:36,878
... took me to the Sao Paulo
Detention Center. Carandiru.

1259
02:12:37,409 --> 02:12:41,038
There I heard stories, made
real friends, learned medicine...

1260
02:12:41,209 --> 02:12:45,646
...and penetrated a few
of the mysteries of life in jail...

1261
02:12:45,809 --> 02:12:49,597
... which would have remained
inaccessible were I not a doctor.

1262
02:13:00,249 --> 02:13:02,160
-Morning, doctor.
-Good morning.

1263
02:13:04,889 --> 02:13:08,120
Even today, whenever I hear
the iron gates close behind me...

1264
02:13:08,289 --> 02:13:12,441
...I feel that shudder,
just like all those matinees...

1265
02:13:12,609 --> 02:13:17,046
... where I'd sit glued to my chair as
I watched all those jail films in B&W.

1266
02:13:19,929 --> 02:13:24,207
On October 2, 1992, 111 men died
at the Sao Paulo Detention Center.

1267
02:13:24,369 --> 02:13:26,963
There were no police deaths.

1268

02:13:31,089 --> 02:13:33,762
...the police and the inmates.
I only heard the latter.

02:13:36,249 --> 02:13:40,242
On September 15, 2002,
the last inmates were transferred.

02:13:40,409 --> 02:13:42,684
Once empty, Carandiru
closed its doors.

02:14:03,369 --> 02:14:08,682
On December 9, Carandiru
was finally demolished.
