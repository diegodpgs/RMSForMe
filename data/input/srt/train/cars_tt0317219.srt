Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

10
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,969
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

34
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:31,786
We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.

35
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:33,872
Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof

36
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:37,542
If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

37
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,668
Right, Darrell.

38
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,379
[Bob] Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,

39
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:43,548
heading into the final race
of the season.

40
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:48,386
And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.

41
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:50,138
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

42
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:52,640
have one more victory in him
before retirement?

43
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:55,310
[Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!

44
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,562
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

45
00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:01,024
[Bob] And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

46
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:03,610
He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.

47
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:05,820
[Darrell] Chick thought
this was his year.

48
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:08,656
His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.

49
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,827
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!

50
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:15,496
[Bob] You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.

51
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,208
The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.

52
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,792
But everyone knows him now.

53
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:23,922
[Darrell] Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

54
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:26,591
[Bob] The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!

[Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

73
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:41,749
[Darrell] There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

74
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,042
Not in one piece, that is.

00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:05,773
[Darrell] Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

79
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:08,318
[Bob] A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

80
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:10,486
Yeah! Ka-chow!

Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]

[Bob] While everyone
heads into the pits,

84
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,997
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

85
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,083
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

[Air wrench whirring]

[Chuckling] What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

88
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,301
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?

89
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:34,427
He's not pitting!

90
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,639
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

91
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,474
McQueen's not going into the pits!

92
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:43,102
[Darrell] The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

93
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,480
- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

94
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,774
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

95
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:51,236
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

96
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,696
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

Come on, come on, come on!

We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

100
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:26,938
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- [Male] What?

101
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:29,148
You need tires, you idiot!

102
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,443
[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

103
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:33,945
[Bob] Right. No tires again.

104
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:36,698
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

105
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:40,451
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

106

[Cars whizzing]

107
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:52,797
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

108
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:55,758
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

109
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,094
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

113

[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

114
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:11,691
[Bob] And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

Come on. [grunting]

I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

[Darrell] Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

128
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,949
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

Lightning!

130
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:05,662
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

131
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:09,207
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

139
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:32,438
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.

140
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:33,481
Tell me about it!

141
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:36,234
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?

142
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:39,737
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.

143
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:43,700
I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?

144
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,702
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

145
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,912
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

146
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:50,164
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.

What? Oh, yeah, right.

148
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,793
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.

- Yo, Chuck.

00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:00,008
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:02,093
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

153
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:05,763
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

154
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:09,893
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

155
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,686
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

156
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:15,523
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,308
I want his hood on a platter!

470
00:30:17,392 --> 00:30:20,061
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

471
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:23,898
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

472
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,610
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

473
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:29,195
I'm...

474
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:33,116
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

475
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:36,578
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

476
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:38,288
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

477
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:40,623
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

478
00:30:40,707 --> 00:30:42,166
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

479
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:47,213
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

480
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:49,757
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

481
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:52,260
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

482
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:54,262
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

483
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:57,473
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

484
00:30:57,557 --> 00:31:01,102
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

485
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,146
- What the? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

486
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,274
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

487
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:09,944
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

488
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:11,696
- [Rewing]
- Agh! Ow!

489
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:14,157
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

490
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,242
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

491
00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:20,121
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

492
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:22,790
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

493
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:26,544
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

494
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:28,630
Ka-ching!

495
00:31:28,671 --> 00:31:29,797
Ah!

496
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:31,841
I'll keep that in mind.

497
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:34,427
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

498
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:37,096
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

499
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:38,806
You know her?

500
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,851
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

501
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:42,936
What?

502
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:47,106
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

503
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,985
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

504
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:52,737
What do you want, Sally?

505
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,157
[Sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

506
00:31:56,241 --> 00:31:59,410
No. I know his type. Racecar.

507
00:31:59,494 --> 00:32:01,538
That's the last thing this town needs.

508
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:06,125
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

509
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:10,129
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

510
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:11,631
Here she goes again.

511
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:14,384
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

512
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:18,096
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

513
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,975
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

514
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:25,019
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

515
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:26,271
Ignore him.

516
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:29,691
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

517
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:32,110
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

518
00:32:32,193 --> 00:32:34,988
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

519
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:36,531
And if no one can get to you?

520
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:40,952
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

521
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:43,872
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

522
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:47,333
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

523
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:50,920
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

524
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:54,507
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

525
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:57,719
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

526
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,346
- [All] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

527
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,224
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

528
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:06,561
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

529
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:08,855
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

530
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:10,940
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

531
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:12,025
Oh, he can do it.

532
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:14,903
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

533
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:16,446
[All] Fix the road!

534
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:20,074
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

535
00:33:20,116 --> 00:33:21,409
[All cheer]

536
00:33:21,451 --> 00:33:24,662
[Honking] Order in the court!

537
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:28,208
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

538
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:30,251
- [All] Yeah!
- No!

539
00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:31,669
[VW van] Nice ruling.

540
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,882
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

541
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:39,844
[Chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

542
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:41,763
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

543
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:44,432
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

544
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:47,185
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

545
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:48,937
[Gurgling]

546
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:53,358
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

547
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:56,486
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

548
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:59,280
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

549
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:01,699
What? This place is crazy!

550
00:34:01,783 --> 00:34:03,952
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

551
00:34:03,993 --> 00:34:06,996
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

552
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,081
What?

553
00:34:08,164 --> 00:34:11,709
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

554
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:13,378
You gotta be kidding me.

555
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:16,130
You start there where the road begins.

556
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:19,467
You finish down there
where the road ends.

557
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,721
[Mater] Holy shoot!

558
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:26,641
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

559
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:30,311
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

560
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:31,521
Five days?

561
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:34,524
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

562
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:37,569
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

563
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:40,113
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

564
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,325
[Grunting]

565
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,871
[Tires squealing, engine rewing]

566
00:34:48,204 --> 00:34:50,456
[Lightning] Freedom!

567
00:34:55,753 --> 00:34:59,299
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

568
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:03,344
...and then...
then took the boot off.

569
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:07,223
Whoo-hoo!

570
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:11,978
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

571
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:15,899
California, here I come! Yeah!

572
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:20,278
Oh, feel that wind.

573
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:22,322
Yes!

574
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:23,406
[Sputtering]

575
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,491
No. No, no, no.

576
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:28,119
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

577
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:30,163
How can I be outta gas?

578
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:34,209
[Chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

579
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:36,628
[Stuttering] But how did,
how did... you?

580
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:39,047
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

581
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:42,008
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

582
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:52,810
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

583
00:35:52,894 --> 00:35:53,978
Hey, Sheriff.

584
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:56,314
- Why here?
- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.

585
00:35:56,397 --> 00:35:58,858
- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.

586
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:00,818
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

587
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:03,738
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

588
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,616
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

589
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:09,410
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

590
00:36:09,494 --> 00:36:12,413
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

591
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,833
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

592
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:18,127
That's why we made him the judge.

593
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:22,465
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

594
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:23,925
Now, I'm not one to brag

595
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:27,262
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

596
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:28,763
Oh!

597
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:31,683
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

598
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:33,560
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

599
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:35,895
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

600
00:36:35,979 --> 00:36:40,650
- [Snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!

601
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:43,069
That won't be necessary.

602
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:47,448
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

603
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,118
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

604
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:53,580
Where's he goin'?

605
00:36:53,663 --> 00:36:57,083
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

606
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,668
I shouldn't put up with this.

607
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:01,629
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

608
00:37:01,671 --> 00:37:04,716
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

609
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:08,177
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

610
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:10,889
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

611
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:14,934
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

612
00:37:15,018 --> 00:37:17,312
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

613
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:19,480
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

614
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:21,566
I must scream it to the world!

615
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:25,862
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

616
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:28,448
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

617
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:31,492
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

618
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:35,205
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

619
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:42,629
Is that what I think it is?

620
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:45,465
[Sally] Customers.

621
00:37:45,548 --> 00:37:48,968
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

622
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:50,428
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?

623
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:53,348
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

624
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:55,975
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

625
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:59,562
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

626
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:02,315
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

627
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:06,778
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

628
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:09,530
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.

629
00:38:09,572 --> 00:38:12,575
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

630
00:38:12,617 --> 00:38:14,869
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

631
00:38:14,953 --> 00:38:15,995
How can we help you?

632
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,124
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

633
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,419
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

634
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:25,922
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

635
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:28,841
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

636
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:31,970
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

637
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:36,099
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

638
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:37,892
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

639
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:41,145
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

640
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:44,566
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

641
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:46,943
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

642
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:49,362
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

643
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:52,574
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

644
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:56,411
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

645
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:59,914
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

646
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:03,918
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

647
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:05,169
No we just topped off.

648
00:39:05,253 --> 00:39:09,090
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

649
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:11,634
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

650
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:15,054
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

651
00:39:15,138 --> 00:39:18,266
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

652
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:20,643
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

653
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:22,061
Maybe ghost flames!

654
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:24,689
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

655
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:28,651
- [Both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

656
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:31,738
[Chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

657
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:33,323
Ow!

658
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:36,618
[Laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

659
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:38,953
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

660
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:42,498
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

661
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,169
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

662
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:48,504
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

663
00:39:48,588 --> 00:39:51,674
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

664
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:53,927
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

665
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,638
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:39:56,721 --> 00:39:58,181
No, not really. But listen.

667
00:39:58,264 --> 00:40:01,893
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

668
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:04,479
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

669
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:08,399
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

670
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,653
- [locks beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

671
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:15,573
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

672
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:18,826
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

673
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:20,995
I'm becoming one of them!

674
00:40:21,037 --> 00:40:22,789
- [Lightning echoes]
- [Sighing]

675
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:24,999
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

676
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,834
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

677
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:29,754
[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...

678
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:32,549
- That's good.
- ... after a Piston Cup update.

679
00:40:32,632 --> 00:40:36,511
[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California

680
00:40:36,594 --> 00:40:40,056
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.

681
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:43,309
[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

682
00:40:43,393 --> 00:40:47,146
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.

683
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,690
[Electronic music]

684
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:50,525
[Laughing]

685
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,360
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

686
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:58,449
Ha-ha!

687
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:03,288
Yeah!

688
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:06,666
[Crowd shouting and cheering]

689
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:14,841
[Girls chattering and giggling]

690
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:17,218
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

691
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:19,554
[Gasping] Oh!

692
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:20,972
Let me get this straight.

693
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:23,975
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

694
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:27,770
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

695
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:28,938
I got a road to finish.

696
00:41:30,273 --> 00:41:32,650
[Grunting and rewing]

697
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:43,203
- He's done!
- Done?

698
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:45,622
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

699
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:50,919
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

700
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,838
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

701
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:58,092
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

702
00:41:58,676 --> 00:42:00,261
Oh!

703
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:04,307
[Vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

704
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:08,019
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

705
00:42:08,144 --> 00:42:11,606
- Oh!
- [Blubbering]

706
00:42:11,981 --> 00:42:13,983
Red.

707
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:17,946
Who do you think you are?

708
00:42:17,987 --> 00:42:21,282
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

709
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:24,827
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

710
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:27,330
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

711
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:31,042
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

712
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,585
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

713
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:36,923
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

714
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:40,802
- What?
- [Chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

715
00:42:40,843 --> 00:42:43,221
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

716
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:45,974
If I win, you do the road my way.

717
00:42:46,057 --> 00:42:47,600
Doc, what're you doin'?

718
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:49,811
I don't mean to be rude here,

719
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:53,606
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

720
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,192
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

721
00:42:56,276 --> 00:43:00,947
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

722
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:05,201
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

723
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:09,789
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

724
00:43:09,873 --> 00:43:12,792
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

725
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:15,378
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

726
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:20,592
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

727
00:43:20,675 --> 00:43:22,427
and no lollygaggin'.

728
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,053
Speed. I'm speed.

729
00:43:24,137 --> 00:43:26,681
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

730
00:43:26,764 --> 00:43:27,807
[Luigi laughs]

731
00:43:27,932 --> 00:43:32,729
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

732
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:35,315
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

733
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:38,276
The race is only one lap, guys.

734
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:40,820
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

735
00:43:40,904 --> 00:43:44,741
- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.

736
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:49,913
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

737
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:51,998
Gentlemen...

738
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:55,501
...start your engines!

739
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:59,297
[Engine sputters]

740
00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:02,217
[Rewing furiously]

741
00:44:02,258 --> 00:44:04,636
- !Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.

742
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:07,805
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

743
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:09,474
Luigi?

744
00:44:09,557 --> 00:44:12,727
[Chuckling] On your mark, get set...

745
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,063
Uno for the money,
due for the show,

746
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:20,818
tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!

747
00:44:22,153 --> 00:44:23,238
[Giggling]

748
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:26,741
[Cheering]

749
00:44:29,285 --> 00:44:30,620
Huh?

750
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:33,790
Doc... the flag means go.

751
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:37,210
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

752
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:40,004
Doc, what are you doing, man?

753
00:44:40,088 --> 00:44:43,633
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

754
00:44:43,716 --> 00:44:46,844
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

755
00:44:46,928 --> 00:44:49,681
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

756
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:52,809
You got your tow cable?

757
00:44:52,892 --> 00:44:55,103
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

758
00:44:55,144 --> 00:44:57,438
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

759
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:08,199
[Yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

760
00:45:08,283 --> 00:45:09,993
No, no, no, no, no!

761
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:12,537
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

762
00:45:13,288 --> 00:45:15,582
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

763
00:45:15,665 --> 00:45:17,083
[Rewing]

764
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:24,757
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

765
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:27,176
- I'm confused.
- [Chuckling]

766
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,345
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

767
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:32,640
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

768
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:38,271
[Gasps] Ah!

769
00:45:39,022 --> 00:45:41,983
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

770
00:45:42,025 --> 00:45:45,153
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

771
00:45:48,281 --> 00:45:50,199
I can make a little turn on dirt.

772
00:45:50,283 --> 00:45:51,701
You think?

773
00:45:51,784 --> 00:45:56,247
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

774
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:58,791
<i>Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!</i>

775
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,836
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

776
00:46:01,878 --> 00:46:04,255
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.

777
00:46:04,339 --> 00:46:08,801
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

778
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:10,470
Nah, not me, Flo.

779
00:46:10,553 --> 00:46:13,014
I'm on one of them there special diets.

780
00:46:13,056 --> 00:46:17,685
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

781
00:46:18,228 --> 00:46:20,521
"You race like you fix roads."

782
00:46:20,563 --> 00:46:25,360
[Grunting] I'll show him.
[Grunting] I will show him!

783
00:46:33,701 --> 00:46:38,039
- [Tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!

784
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:41,709
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [Chuckles] Music. Sweet music.

785
00:46:42,919 --> 00:46:45,505
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

786
00:46:45,588 --> 00:46:48,299
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

787
00:46:48,383 --> 00:46:51,386
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

788
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,725
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

789
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,864
Wow.

790
00:47:12,198 --> 00:47:13,908
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!

791
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:19,163
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

792
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,249
Yes! Uh, amazing!

793
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:25,378
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]

794
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:29,632
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

795
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:32,260
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

796
00:47:32,343 --> 00:47:36,472
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

797
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:38,766
[Italian] É bellissima! It's beautiful!

798
00:47:38,808 --> 00:47:42,562
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

799
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:44,772
Boy, I tell you what.

800
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:47,692
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

801
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:49,444
Doc, look at this!

802
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:52,447
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

803
00:47:52,488 --> 00:47:55,992
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

804
00:47:56,075 --> 00:47:59,037
Guido, look at Luigi!

805
00:47:59,662 --> 00:48:01,372
This is fantastico!

806
00:48:01,456 --> 00:48:04,918
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

807
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:09,297
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

808
00:48:09,964 --> 00:48:12,634
That crazy old devil woman.

809
00:48:13,134 --> 00:48:16,512
[Sighs] Oh!

810
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:18,431
She's right!

811
00:48:18,514 --> 00:48:20,058
- Ah!
- Guido!

812
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:23,895
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

813
00:48:25,188 --> 00:48:28,983
Well, now... where the heck is he?

814
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:38,034
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

815
00:48:38,117 --> 00:48:41,496
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

816
00:48:41,538 --> 00:48:43,915
and asked me if he could
come down here.

817
00:48:43,998 --> 00:48:46,376
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

818
00:48:46,459 --> 00:48:49,295
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

819
00:48:49,754 --> 00:48:52,298
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

820
00:48:54,509 --> 00:48:58,471
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

821
00:48:58,555 --> 00:48:59,931
I'll keep an eye on him.

822
00:49:00,014 --> 00:49:03,893
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

823
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:08,356
[Engine rewing]

824
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:13,736
[Screaming]

825
00:49:15,363 --> 00:49:17,532
[Spitting]

826
00:49:18,283 --> 00:49:20,743
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

827
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:23,538
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

828
00:49:23,621 --> 00:49:26,958
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

829
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:30,503
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

830
00:49:30,587 --> 00:49:33,673
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

831
00:49:33,756 --> 00:49:36,843
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

832
00:49:36,926 --> 00:49:38,553
I'll put it simple.

833
00:49:38,636 --> 00:49:42,807
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

834
00:49:43,892 --> 00:49:49,272
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

835
00:49:49,355 --> 00:49:51,149
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

836
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:54,819
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

837
00:49:57,614 --> 00:50:01,034
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

838
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:04,078
[Groans]

839
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:10,585
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

840
00:50:11,878 --> 00:50:13,880
Hmm...

841
00:50:13,963 --> 00:50:15,006
Whoa!

842
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:18,801
- Oh!
- [Car crashing]

843
00:50:19,302 --> 00:50:23,223
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

844
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:28,186
[Screaming] Ow!

845
00:50:29,646 --> 00:50:32,899
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

846
00:50:32,982 --> 00:50:36,069
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

847
00:50:36,152 --> 00:50:39,530
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

848
00:50:39,614 --> 00:50:43,535
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

849
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:53,962
- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?

850
00:50:54,045 --> 00:50:58,424
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

851
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:00,927
[Grunts, passes gas]

852
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,012
Oh, Lord.

853
00:51:03,096 --> 00:51:04,722
- [Chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

854
00:51:04,806 --> 00:51:06,975
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

855
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:10,311
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

856
00:51:10,395 --> 00:51:13,231
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

857
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:15,775
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

858
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:18,528
[Groaning] Oh...

859
00:51:18,611 --> 00:51:21,281
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

860
00:51:21,364 --> 00:51:23,908
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

861
00:51:23,992 --> 00:51:27,245
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

862
00:51:27,328 --> 00:51:29,622
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

863
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:31,708
You make-a such a nice new road.

864
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:34,460
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

865
00:51:34,544 --> 00:51:36,129
Even though you not a Ferrari.

866
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:40,300
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

867
00:51:40,383 --> 00:51:44,220
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

868
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:47,807
[Chuckling] I like your style, eh?

869
00:51:47,891 --> 00:51:51,477
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

870
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:54,981
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

871
00:51:55,064 --> 00:51:56,733
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

872
00:51:56,816 --> 00:51:58,943
Ramone, Ramone!

873
00:51:59,027 --> 00:52:01,112
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

874
00:52:01,195 --> 00:52:04,157
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

875
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,869
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

876
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:12,665
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

877
00:52:12,749 --> 00:52:15,585
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

878
00:52:15,668 --> 00:52:16,920
[Exhales deeply]

879
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,171
Ah!

880
00:52:18,254 --> 00:52:20,381
Stop! Let me...

881
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:24,594
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

882
00:52:24,677 --> 00:52:26,679
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

883
00:52:26,763 --> 00:52:30,099
Stop, stop! That's cold!

884
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:32,685
Help! Please! Stop!

885
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:36,105
- [Coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

886
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:38,608
What was that for?

887
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:40,818
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

888
00:52:40,902 --> 00:52:42,362
If you do, you gotta be clean.

889
00:52:42,445 --> 00:52:44,989
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

890
00:52:45,073 --> 00:52:46,783
What, I? I don't get it.

891
00:52:46,866 --> 00:52:49,452
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

892
00:52:49,536 --> 00:52:52,747
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

893
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,460
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

894
00:52:57,544 --> 00:53:01,422
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

895
00:53:01,464 --> 00:53:03,883
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

896
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:07,220
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

897
00:53:07,303 --> 00:53:10,473
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

898
00:53:10,557 --> 00:53:14,018
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

899
00:53:14,102 --> 00:53:18,231
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

900
00:53:18,314 --> 00:53:21,651
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

901
00:53:23,152 --> 00:53:25,405
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

902
00:53:26,364 --> 00:53:28,825
Cone number one, if you want.

903
00:53:29,951 --> 00:53:32,287
Oh...

904
00:53:33,454 --> 00:53:37,166
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

905
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,336
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

906
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,589
[Both chuckle]

907
00:53:42,922 --> 00:53:46,259
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

908
00:53:46,342 --> 00:53:48,970
Gonna... Yeah.

909
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:56,311
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [Gasps]

910
00:53:56,352 --> 00:53:57,854
Good-lookin' girl.

911
00:53:57,937 --> 00:54:01,232
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

912
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:04,777
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

913
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:08,364
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

914
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:12,577
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

915
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,831
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

916
00:54:16,873 --> 00:54:20,460
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

917
00:54:20,543 --> 00:54:22,837
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

918
00:54:22,879 --> 00:54:24,672
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

919
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:27,717
You know who you're talkin' to?

01:03:48,444 --> 01:03:51,114
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

1075
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:53,700
[Sheriff] Hope you enjoyed the show!

1076

[Groaning]

1077
01:04:07,297 --> 01:04:09,090
Whoa, Doc.

1078
01:04:09,132 --> 01:04:12,886
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

1079
01:04:28,735 --> 01:04:30,570
What?

1080
01:04:31,654 --> 01:04:34,449
He has a Piston Cup?

1081
01:04:41,539 --> 01:04:43,291
Oh, my gosh.

1082
01:04:44,667 --> 01:04:46,711
Three Piston Cups?

1083
01:04:59,015 --> 01:05:01,017
- [Doc] Sign says stay out.
- [Gasps]

1084
01:05:01,851 --> 01:05:04,479
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

1085
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,649
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

1086
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:10,735
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

1087
01:05:10,818 --> 01:05:13,321
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

1088
01:05:13,404 --> 01:05:15,156
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

1089
01:05:15,198 --> 01:05:18,868
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

1090
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:21,663
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.

1091
01:05:21,746 --> 01:05:24,499
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

1092
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:28,002
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

1093
01:05:30,713 --> 01:05:32,215
[Country music]

[Country music]

1095
01:05:33,216 --> 01:05:38,513
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

1096
01:05:38,596 --> 01:05:40,390
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

1097
01:05:40,473 --> 01:05:43,685
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!

1098
01:05:43,768 --> 01:05:47,522
- [Ramone] Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!

1099
01:05:47,564 --> 01:05:48,648
There he is.

1100
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:51,693
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

1101
01:05:54,946 --> 01:05:57,699
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

1102
01:05:57,782 --> 01:06:00,368
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

1103
01:06:00,451 --> 01:06:02,704
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

1104
01:06:02,787 --> 01:06:06,082
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

1105
01:06:06,165 --> 01:06:08,209
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

1106
01:06:08,293 --> 01:06:11,880
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

1107
01:06:11,963 --> 01:06:15,842
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

1108
01:06:15,925 --> 01:06:18,219
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

1109
01:06:18,303 --> 01:06:20,430
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

1110
01:06:20,513 --> 01:06:22,891
[Ramone] I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

1111
01:06:22,974 --> 01:06:25,727
- [Mater] Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.

1112
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,562
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

1113
01:06:28,813 --> 01:06:29,814
[Gas bell rings]

1114
01:06:29,898 --> 01:06:33,401
- [Sheriff] Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's OK. You can trust me, right?

1115
01:06:33,484 --> 01:06:36,195
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

1116
01:06:37,113 --> 01:06:39,449
Hmm... I trust him.

1117
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,744
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

1118
01:06:42,785 --> 01:06:44,078
Yeah, a drive.

1119
01:06:44,162 --> 01:06:47,290
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

1120
01:06:47,373 --> 01:06:50,084
Ah... No. No, we don't.

1121

[Gas pump stops]

1122
01:07:12,565 --> 01:07:16,402
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

1123
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,409
[Flo] Mm-hm!

1124
01:07:23,493 --> 01:07:26,913
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

1125
01:07:26,996 --> 01:07:29,457
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

1126
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,460
That's so too much!

1127
01:07:34,504 --> 01:07:36,965
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

1128
01:07:37,006 --> 01:07:39,008
I don't know.

1129
01:07:43,888 --> 01:07:45,890

[Chuckles] Oh!

[Spitting]

1138
01:09:34,332 --> 01:09:38,086
[Lightning] Wow. What is this place?

1139
01:09:38,795 --> 01:09:40,129
Wheel Well.

1140
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:43,466
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

1141
01:09:48,137 --> 01:09:49,847
This place?

[Horns beeping]

1143
01:09:53,476 --> 01:09:55,520
[Sally sighing] Yeah, imagine.

1144
01:09:57,188 --> 01:09:59,941
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

1145
01:10:02,277 --> 01:10:03,820
You know, I don't get you.

1146
01:10:03,903 --> 01:10:07,115
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

1147
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:09,409
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

1148
01:10:09,492 --> 01:10:13,621
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

1149
01:10:13,705 --> 01:10:17,292
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

1150
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:20,753
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

1151
01:10:21,504 --> 01:10:24,132
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

1152
01:10:24,215 --> 01:10:25,967
And you know what?

1153
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:29,679
It never felt... happy.

1154
01:10:31,347 --> 01:10:34,434
Yeah. I mean... really?

1155
01:10:34,517 --> 01:10:36,227
Yeah. So I left California.

1156
01:10:36,311 --> 01:10:39,606
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1157
01:10:40,356 --> 01:10:43,151
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1158
01:10:43,192 --> 01:10:46,195
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1159
01:10:47,488 --> 01:10:49,157
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1160
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,076
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

1161
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,872
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

1162
01:10:56,873 --> 01:11:00,293
[Inhaling heavily] I fell in love.

1163
01:11:00,376 --> 01:11:04,047
- Oh.
- Yep.

- Corvette?
- No.

1165
01:11:13,223 --> 01:11:16,017
I fell in love with this.

1166
01:11:28,029 --> 01:11:31,741
Whoa. Look at that.

1167
01:11:32,617 --> 01:11:34,953
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1168
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:37,205
They don't even know
what they're missing!

1169
01:11:38,248 --> 01:11:40,542
[Sally] Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

1170
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:43,378
Oh, yeah?

1171
01:11:43,419 --> 01:11:47,340
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1172
01:11:48,466 --> 01:11:49,467
Really?

1173
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:52,220
[Sally] Yeah. Back then,

1174
01:11:52,303 --> 01:11:55,181
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

1175
01:11:56,432 --> 01:11:57,767
How do you mean?

1176
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:01,229
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

1177
01:12:01,312 --> 01:12:05,525
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

1178
01:12:07,026 --> 01:12:09,028
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

1179
01:12:10,947 --> 01:12:13,741
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

1180
01:12:13,783 --> 01:12:16,369
They drove on it to have a great time.

1181

[# James Taylor: Our Town]

1182
01:12:50,361 --> 01:12:52,780
Well, what happened?

1183
01:12:52,822 --> 01:12:56,284
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

1184
01:14:22,453 --> 01:14:26,040
[Lightning] How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

1185
01:14:26,124 --> 01:14:28,918
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

1186
01:14:29,002 --> 01:14:32,672
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1379
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,915
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1380
01:28:18,998 --> 01:28:21,584
[Harv] Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?

1381
01:28:21,668 --> 01:28:24,170
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1382
01:28:25,797 --> 01:28:28,716
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1383
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,053
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1384
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:34,389
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1385
01:28:35,348 --> 01:28:36,349
- Harv?
- Come on!

1386
01:28:36,391 --> 01:28:39,102
- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?

1387
01:28:39,185 --> 01:28:41,854
My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!

1388
01:28:41,938 --> 01:28:44,107
- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.

1389
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:48,570
I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!

1390
01:28:48,653 --> 01:28:51,698
You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?

1391
01:28:51,781 --> 01:28:54,242
That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.

1392
01:28:54,325 --> 01:28:56,619
Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.

1393
01:28:56,703 --> 01:28:59,205
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1394
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:02,500
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.

1395
01:29:02,584 --> 01:29:03,751
Playtime is over, pal.

1396
01:29:03,835 --> 01:29:07,672
While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

1397
01:29:07,755 --> 01:29:09,424
- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!

1398
01:29:09,507 --> 01:29:13,136
Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.

1399
01:29:13,219 --> 01:29:15,388
- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?

1400
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:19,100
You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

1401
01:29:19,142 --> 01:29:22,437
<i>- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1402
01:29:22,478 --> 01:29:26,482
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1403
01:29:26,566 --> 01:29:28,276
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1404
01:29:28,443 --> 01:29:30,153
No, wait. Where are you goin'?

1405
01:29:30,236 --> 01:29:33,489
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?

1406
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:40,455
Sally, I... I want you to...

1407
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:44,167
Look, I wish... [sighs]

1408
01:29:45,627 --> 01:29:48,504
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1409
01:29:48,588 --> 01:29:50,590
[Groans, chuckles]

1410
01:29:50,673 --> 01:29:55,887
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1411
01:29:59,015 --> 01:30:02,227
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1412
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:05,521
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1413
01:30:05,605 --> 01:30:08,316
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1414
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:10,652
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1415
01:30:13,029 --> 01:30:16,032
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1416
01:30:16,115 --> 01:30:18,201
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1417
01:30:18,284 --> 01:30:21,496
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1418
01:30:21,579 --> 01:30:23,665
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1419
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,298
- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?

1420
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:34,717
- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!

1421
01:30:34,801 --> 01:30:37,512
You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.

1422
01:30:37,554 --> 01:30:39,847
You don't belong there, anyway.

1423
01:30:39,931 --> 01:30:42,934
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1424
01:30:43,393 --> 01:30:45,687
[Engine starts]

1425
01:30:45,728 --> 01:30:47,981
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1426
01:30:55,113 --> 01:30:57,490
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1427
01:30:57,532 --> 01:30:59,951
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1428
01:31:08,418 --> 01:31:12,171
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1429
01:31:12,797 --> 01:31:15,925
Best for everyone or best for you?

1430
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,236
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1431
01:32:20,823 --> 01:32:23,117
[Light buzzing]

1432
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:38,132
[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1433
01:32:38,174 --> 01:32:40,468
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1434
01:32:40,552 --> 01:32:42,804
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1435
01:32:42,845 --> 01:32:45,306
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1436
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:47,934
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1437
01:32:48,017 --> 01:32:52,355
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1438
01:32:52,438 --> 01:32:54,983
[Bob] The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1439
01:32:55,066 --> 01:32:58,403
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1440
01:32:58,486 --> 01:33:01,698
[Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1441
01:33:01,781 --> 01:33:05,785
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1442
01:33:05,827 --> 01:33:08,162
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1443
01:33:08,246 --> 01:33:12,333
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1444
01:33:12,417 --> 01:33:15,044
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1445
01:33:15,128 --> 01:33:19,215
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1446
01:33:19,299 --> 01:33:22,385
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1447
01:33:22,468 --> 01:33:23,469
[Mia] He's hot!

1448
01:33:23,511 --> 01:33:26,180
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1449
01:33:26,264 --> 01:33:29,350
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1450
01:33:29,434 --> 01:33:31,978
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1451
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:34,981
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1452
01:33:35,023 --> 01:33:37,817
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1453
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:40,987
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1454
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:46,034
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1455
01:33:46,117 --> 01:33:50,038
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1456
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:51,372
[Guard] Sorry, pal.

1457
01:33:51,414 --> 01:33:55,710
[Lightning] OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1458
01:33:56,461 --> 01:33:59,255
I am speed.

1459
01:33:59,339 --> 01:34:00,924
[Cars whizzing]

1460
01:34:01,007 --> 01:34:02,217
Victory.

1461
01:34:02,258 --> 01:34:04,385
One winner, two losers.

1462
01:34:04,469 --> 01:34:06,429
[Engine rewing]

1463
01:34:06,512 --> 01:34:12,018
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1464
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:14,687
[birds singing]

1465
01:34:16,147 --> 01:34:17,148
[Knock on door]

1466
01:34:17,232 --> 01:34:18,816
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?

1467
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:21,569
[Gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1468
01:34:24,864 --> 01:34:27,867
[Indistinct chatter]

1469
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:37,752
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1470
01:34:37,835 --> 01:34:40,421
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1471
01:34:40,505 --> 01:34:42,924
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1472
01:34:42,966 --> 01:34:45,343
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1473
01:34:50,723 --> 01:34:52,725
[All shouting]

1474
01:34:52,767 --> 01:34:54,519
[Gulping]

1475
01:35:02,610 --> 01:35:04,028
Uh-oh

1476
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,660
- [cheering, laughing]
- [Giggling]

1477
01:35:14,914 --> 01:35:17,876
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1478
01:35:18,042 --> 01:35:20,295
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1479
01:35:20,336 --> 01:35:23,464
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1480
01:35:23,548 --> 01:35:25,967
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1481
01:35:26,009 --> 01:35:29,095
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1482
01:35:30,221 --> 01:35:33,349
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1483
01:35:33,433 --> 01:35:34,601
[Chuckling]

1484
01:35:34,642 --> 01:35:36,978
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1485
01:35:37,061 --> 01:35:39,981
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1486
01:35:40,023 --> 01:35:43,026
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1487
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:46,279
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1488
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,163
Agh! Shoot!

1489
01:35:55,246 --> 01:35:58,374
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1490
01:36:02,003 --> 01:36:04,547
[Crowd cheering]

1491
01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:06,216
Come on, you can do it!

1492
01:36:06,299 --> 01:36:08,301
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1493
01:36:09,552 --> 01:36:12,722
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1494
01:36:12,805 --> 01:36:16,017
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1495
01:36:18,186 --> 01:36:20,355
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1496
01:36:20,438 --> 01:36:22,857
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1497
01:36:22,899 --> 01:36:24,651
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

1498
01:36:24,692 --> 01:36:27,028
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1499
01:36:30,907 --> 01:36:33,910
- [Soft music]
- [Birds singing]

1500

[Breaks squealing]

1501
01:36:36,412 --> 01:36:38,498
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

1502
01:36:38,581 --> 01:36:39,582
[All gasp]

1503
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:45,046
[Chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1504
01:36:45,129 --> 01:36:48,675
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [All laugh]

1505
01:36:48,716 --> 01:36:49,759
[Groans]

1506
01:36:49,842 --> 01:36:53,888
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1507
01:36:53,972 --> 01:36:55,390
I don't think I...

1508
01:36:55,473 --> 01:36:58,226
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1509
01:36:58,434 --> 01:36:59,978
Doc?

1510
01:37:02,647 --> 01:37:05,275
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1511
01:37:05,358 --> 01:37:09,112
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1512
01:37:09,195 --> 01:37:11,072
You said you'd never come back.

1513
01:37:11,155 --> 01:37:14,742
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1514
01:37:14,826 --> 01:37:17,745
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1515
01:37:17,787 --> 01:37:19,664
[Chuckles]

1516
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:25,211
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1517
01:37:25,253 --> 01:37:28,548
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1518
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:30,592
Now, get back out there!

1519
01:37:32,844 --> 01:37:35,805
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1520
01:37:35,889 --> 01:37:38,182
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1521
01:37:38,266 --> 01:37:41,436
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1522
01:37:41,477 --> 01:37:43,187
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1523
01:37:43,271 --> 01:37:46,649
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1524
01:37:55,909 --> 01:37:58,286
[Murmuring]

1525
01:37:58,369 --> 01:38:00,288
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1526
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:04,125
Is that? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1527
01:38:04,167 --> 01:38:06,794
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1528
01:38:06,878 --> 01:38:09,297
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1529
01:38:09,339 --> 01:38:12,050
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1530
01:38:12,133 --> 01:38:15,470
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1531
01:38:17,931 --> 01:38:20,016
[Crowd cheering]

1532
01:38:20,099 --> 01:38:22,101
[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.

1533
01:38:22,185 --> 01:38:25,104
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!

1534
01:38:25,146 --> 01:38:26,564
Hey, Doc!

1535
01:38:26,648 --> 01:38:30,818
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1536
01:38:35,698 --> 01:38:39,494
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

1537
01:38:39,577 --> 01:38:42,497
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1538
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:45,458
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1539
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,126
Vai! Vai, vai!

1540
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:50,088
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1541
01:38:50,171 --> 01:38:53,591
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1542
01:38:53,675 --> 01:38:54,676
[All laugh]

1543
01:38:54,759 --> 01:38:57,345
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?

1544
01:38:57,428 --> 01:39:00,598
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1545
01:39:15,029 --> 01:39:17,865
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1546
01:39:19,409 --> 01:39:20,702
What do you think of this?

1547
01:39:20,743 --> 01:39:22,912
- [Tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

1548
01:39:26,207 --> 01:39:27,542
What?

1549
01:39:27,584 --> 01:39:29,377
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1550
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:35,425
- [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1551
01:39:35,508 --> 01:39:38,469
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1552
01:39:38,553 --> 01:39:40,388
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1553
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:43,600
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1554
01:39:47,228 --> 01:39:50,440
[Chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

1555
01:39:56,154 --> 01:39:58,448
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

1556
01:39:59,407 --> 01:40:00,950
No, you don't.

1557
01:40:02,076 --> 01:40:03,953
[Tire blows]

1558
01:40:04,037 --> 01:40:06,039
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1559
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:09,542
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1560
01:40:09,584 --> 01:40:12,921
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1561
01:40:14,839 --> 01:40:16,966
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

1562
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:19,969
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1563
01:40:20,053 --> 01:40:22,222
Guido! It's time.

1564
01:40:26,476 --> 01:40:29,562
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1565
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:34,692
[Air wrench whirring]

1566
01:40:38,696 --> 01:40:40,114
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

1567
01:40:40,198 --> 01:40:41,908
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1568
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:44,536
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1569
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:46,287
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

1570
01:40:47,956 --> 01:40:50,458
- Yeah, baby!
- [All hollering]

1571
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,876
[Darrell] He's back in!

1572
01:40:53,211 --> 01:40:54,212
Peet stop.

1573
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,590
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1574
01:41:12,855 --> 01:41:15,942
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1575
01:41:15,984 --> 01:41:18,361
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1576
01:41:18,444 --> 01:41:21,948
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1577
01:41:22,031 --> 01:41:23,324
This is it, kiddo.

1578
01:41:23,366 --> 01:41:25,869
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1579
01:41:25,952 --> 01:41:28,371
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1580
01:41:28,454 --> 01:41:29,831
- Go!
- [Rewing]

1581
01:41:32,542 --> 01:41:33,668
We'll see about that!

1582
01:41:35,169 --> 01:41:36,754
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!

1583
01:41:39,716 --> 01:41:42,760
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!

1584
01:41:53,438 --> 01:41:55,899
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!

1585
01:41:56,316 --> 01:41:58,985
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1586
01:42:00,028 --> 01:42:03,656
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]

1587
01:42:05,241 --> 01:42:08,244
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1588
01:42:08,328 --> 01:42:10,413
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1589
01:42:11,915 --> 01:42:15,710
[Grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1590
01:42:26,054 --> 01:42:27,972
- Oh, no!
- [Crowd gasps]

1591
01:42:37,232 --> 01:42:39,400
[Breaks screeching]

1592
01:42:41,861 --> 01:42:43,154
[Engine idling]

1593
01:42:46,491 --> 01:42:48,701
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1594
01:42:48,743 --> 01:42:52,497
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1595
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:55,917
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?

1596
01:43:04,259 --> 01:43:06,219
[Grunting, moaning]

1597
01:43:06,302 --> 01:43:07,679
What are you doin', kid?

1598
01:43:07,762 --> 01:43:10,974
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1599
01:43:14,143 --> 01:43:17,146
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1600
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:20,817
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1601
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,944
It's just an empty cup.

1602
01:43:25,071 --> 01:43:27,615
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1603
01:43:27,699 --> 01:43:31,369
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1604
01:43:31,452 --> 01:43:33,746
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1605
01:43:33,788 --> 01:43:36,499
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1606
01:43:36,583 --> 01:43:38,835
- That's what I call racin'.
- [Sobbing]

1607
01:43:38,918 --> 01:43:40,378
[Laughing]

1608
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:45,383
[Crowd cheers wildly]

1609
01:43:54,809 --> 01:43:57,854
- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!

1610
01:43:57,937 --> 01:44:00,523
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1611
01:44:00,607 --> 01:44:05,111
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1612
01:44:07,155 --> 01:44:10,617
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1613
01:44:10,658 --> 01:44:12,076
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1614
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:15,121
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1615
01:44:15,163 --> 01:44:18,291
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1616
01:44:18,374 --> 01:44:20,627
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1617
01:44:20,668 --> 01:44:24,297
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1618
01:44:24,339 --> 01:44:27,675
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1619
01:44:27,717 --> 01:44:29,177
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1620
01:44:29,344 --> 01:44:30,887
- Boo!
- Boo!

1621
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:34,057
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1622
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:36,226
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1623
01:44:42,148 --> 01:44:44,651
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1624
01:44:47,028 --> 01:44:49,489
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1625
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:51,532
You're The King! Yeah!

1626
01:44:52,033 --> 01:44:54,327
[Crowd cheers]

1627
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:01,876
[Laughing and cheering]

1628
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:05,421
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1629
01:45:08,633 --> 01:45:11,261
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1630
01:45:11,469 --> 01:45:13,137
Thanks, Doc.

1631
01:45:14,264 --> 01:45:15,598
Hey, Lightnin'.

1632
01:45:15,682 --> 01:45:18,351
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1633
01:45:19,227 --> 01:45:22,272
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1634
01:45:22,355 --> 01:45:25,108
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1635
01:45:29,821 --> 01:45:31,281
But I didn't win.

1636
01:45:31,364 --> 01:45:35,034
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1637
01:45:35,076 --> 01:45:37,787
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1638
01:45:37,871 --> 01:45:42,041
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [All laugh]

1639
01:45:42,083 --> 01:45:43,835
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1640
01:45:43,918 --> 01:45:47,630
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1641
01:45:49,173 --> 01:45:50,925
I'm gonna stick with them.

1642
01:45:50,967 --> 01:45:54,053
Well, I sure can respect that.

1643
01:45:54,095 --> 01:45:55,263
Still, you know,

1644
01:45:55,346 --> 01:45:59,225
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1645
01:45:59,267 --> 01:46:01,811
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1646
01:46:03,271 --> 01:46:06,274
Actually, there is one thing.

1647
01:46:06,983 --> 01:46:07,984
Whoo-hoo!

1648
01:46:07,984 --> 01:46:09,235
Whoo-hoo!

1649
01:46:09,277 --> 01:46:13,156
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1650
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:20,663
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1651
01:46:24,292 --> 01:46:26,628
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1652
01:46:29,756 --> 01:46:33,176
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1653
01:46:33,259 --> 01:46:34,260
to get tires.

1654
01:46:34,302 --> 01:46:38,514
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1655
01:46:38,598 --> 01:46:43,811
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1656
01:46:43,853 --> 01:46:46,147
A real Ferrari!

1657
01:46:46,231 --> 01:46:48,358
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1658
01:46:48,441 --> 01:46:51,903
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1659
01:46:53,196 --> 01:46:56,783
Wow. [Italian]
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.

1660
01:46:56,824 --> 01:46:59,160
Mi dicono che siete fantastici.

1661
01:47:08,545 --> 01:47:12,840
- [Sighing]
- [Engine rewing]

1662
01:47:13,174 --> 01:47:15,385
[Both chuckle]

1663
01:47:15,468 --> 01:47:16,970
Just passin' through?

1664
01:47:17,053 --> 01:47:19,347
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1665
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:22,684
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1666
01:47:22,767 --> 01:47:26,521
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1667
01:47:26,604 --> 01:47:29,065
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1668
01:47:29,148 --> 01:47:31,985
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1669
01:47:32,026 --> 01:47:34,529
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1670
01:47:34,612 --> 01:47:38,741
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1671
01:47:38,825 --> 01:47:40,994
- blah, blah, blah.
- [Lightning chuckles]

1672
01:47:41,369 --> 01:47:44,372
McQueen and Sally

So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

Why don't we just take a drive?

Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?
