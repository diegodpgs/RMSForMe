1
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:17,287
<i>- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!</i>

2
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:27,501
<i>I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.</i>

3
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:38,210
<i>Go back to the Shadow.</i>

4
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:42,916
<i>The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!</i>

5
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,284
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:20,117
No! No!

7
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:22,294
Gandalf!

8
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:31,631
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:34,136
No!

10
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:38,167
Gandalf!

11
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:48,680
Gandalf!

12
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,916
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:55,586
Nothing.

14
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,925
Just a dream.

15
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:19,309
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:23,712
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,693
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:41,773
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:46,105
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:54,508
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:57,917
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:03,086
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:05,522
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:08,930
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:11,699
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:13,567
You never know.

27
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,975
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:22,615
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:25,875
It is special.

30
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:31,656
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:37,396
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:41,356
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:46,037
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:48,675
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:51,978
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:54,114
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,118
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:23,769
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:23,946 --> 00:06:26,141
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,645
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,055
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:38,156
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:43,095
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,434
...but they did.

45
00:06:58,549 --> 00:06:59,481
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:04,820
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:08,391
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,769
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:26,568
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:29,509
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,214
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,932
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,125
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,462
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,578
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,649
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,746
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:45,485
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:48,093
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,459
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,567
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:56,833
I can smell it.

63
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:02,510
We're not alone.

64
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,255
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,389
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:27,229
Where is it?

67
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:30,101
Where is it?

68
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:34,005
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:38,410
My precious.

70
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:42,548
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,816
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,713
This is Sting.

73
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:45,408
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:48,087
...haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,651
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,443
It burns!

77
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:15,946
It burns us!

78
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,886
It freezes!

79
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,954
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,787
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:33,464
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:36,230
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:39,997
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:42,872
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,606
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,455
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:55,926 --> 00:12:00,761
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:03,762
Take it off us.

89
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,807
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,909
We swears.

91
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:15,645
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:20,078
We swears...

93
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,084
...to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:29,056
We will swear on...

95
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:31,196
...on the precious.

96
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:33,558
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:37,862
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,035
Yes...

99
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:43,097
...on the precious.

100
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:47,911
On the precious.

101
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,571
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:56,077
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:58,018
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:01,183
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:17,134
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,810
You've been there before?

107
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:24,409
Yes.

108
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:37,958
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,409
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,380
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,783
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:03,425
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:09,587
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,633
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:17,933
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,711
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,347
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,750
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,446
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:36,216
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,518
Follow me!

122
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:53,776
Merry!

123
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:56,236
Merry!

124
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:05,519
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:07,521
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:12,990
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:17,093
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:20,466
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,044
Merry!

130
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:30,545
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,885
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:38,985
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,695
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:48,594
Stop it!

135
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:53,433
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,670
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:01,579
You want some?

138
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:05,683
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,115
Merry.

140
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:13,516
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:17,798
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:20,457
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:24,003
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,437
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:32,737
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:35,012
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:39,519
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:40,623 --> 00:16:41,749
Aragorn.

149
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,290
Let's move!

150
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:11,377
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:14,357
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,288
Hurry!

153
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:21,693
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:27,835
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,975
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:35,135
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:09,743
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

158
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,450
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:16,916
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:22,017
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:26,495
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:30,300
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,779
Rohan.

164
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:46,749
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,515
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:53,662
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:56,798
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:04,871
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,600
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:10,605
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,742
Saruman.

172
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:24,354
<i>The world is changing.</i>

173
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:30,124
<i>Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...</i>

174
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,564
<i>...and Mordor?</i>

175
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:40,904
<i>To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...</i>

176
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:44,707
<i>...and the union of the two towers?</i>

177
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:54,191
<i>Together, my Lord Sauron...</i>

178
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,885
<i>...we shall rule this Middle-earth.</i>

179
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,245
<i>The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.</i>

180
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,082
<i>The forests will fall.</i>

181
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,857
<i>A new order will rise.</i>

182
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:32,830
<i>We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...</i>

183
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:36,958
<i>...and the iron fists of the Orc.</i>

184
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:52,714
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

185
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,513
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,714
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,951
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,961
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:09,599
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,371
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:16,406
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,546
Swear it.

193
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:33,825
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,921
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:41,627
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:43,237
Murderers!

197
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:46,266
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:48,238
Burn every village!

199
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,612
<i>We have only to remove those
who oppose us.</i>

200
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:59,612
<i>It will begin in Rohan.</i>

201
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:03,884
<i>Too long have these peasants
stood against you.</i>

202
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,857
<i>But no more.</i>

203
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:08,293
Éothain! Éothain!

204
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:13,129
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:16,166
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,001
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:21,178
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:23,870
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:27,082
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:30,982
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:37,588
Quickly!

212
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:45,560
Go, child.

213
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,350
<i>Rohan, my lord...</i>

214
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,550
<i>...is ready to fall.</i>

215
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,325
Théodred.

216
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:18,163
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:40,652
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:44,395
My Lord Éomer, over here!

219
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,005
He's alive.

220
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:27,901
Théodred.

221
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:44,317
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:44,728 --> 00:24:47,219
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:52,394
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:55,261
That is a lie.

225
00:24:57,475 --> 00:25:02,276
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:05,939
Gríma.

227
00:25:07,385 --> 00:25:09,319
Gríma.

228
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:13,346
Gríma.

229
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:17,219
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:21,224
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,801
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:38,413
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:41,086
Can you not see?

234
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:46,282
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

235
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:49,018
...your warmongering.

236
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:53,199
Warmongering?

237
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:55,527
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,735
What was the promised price, Gríma?

239
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:02,568
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:17,683
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:19,860
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:32,270
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

243
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,600
Too much.

244
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:40,745
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:45,717
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:48,521
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,159
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:55,528
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,859
It comes from the king.

250
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,061
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:35,333
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:37,268
Breathe.

253
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:45,213
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,392
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,560
...until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:06,105 --> 00:28:08,073
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:12,144 --> 00:28:13,702
Merry!

258
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,410
Merry!

259
00:28:17,117 --> 00:28:22,316
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:33,993
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:37,035
It's the trees.

262
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,830
What?

263
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:43,007
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:47,671
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:49,372
...and come alive.

266
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:51,312
Alive?

267
00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:53,881
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:57,357
...talk to each other...

269
00:28:57,525 --> 00:28:59,322
...even move.

270
00:29:00,963 --> 00:29:03,193
I'm starving.

271
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:07,426
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:29:07,803 --> 00:29:09,065
Yeah!

273
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:12,536
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,105
What about them?

275
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,179
They're fresh.

276
00:29:19,848 --> 00:29:23,615
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:31,560
What about their legs?

278
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:34,059
They don't need those.

279
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:38,728
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:45,439
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:47,743
Alive?

282
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:54,980
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:29:57,388 --> 00:30:00,755
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,950
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:08,730
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,334
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:15,172
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,534
...a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:26,909
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:34,788
Pippin.

291
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,655
Let's go.

292
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:46,594
Go on.

293
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:48,273
Call for help.

294
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:50,767
Squeal.

295
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:54,140
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:03,323 --> 00:31:04,722
Pippin!

297
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:31,507
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:34,954
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,987
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:10,858
...what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:43,025
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:43,827 --> 00:32:45,089
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:50,094
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,769
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,580
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,676
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,295
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:22,829
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:26,233
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

310
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:31,741
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:34,174
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,653
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

313
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:42,755
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:47,717
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:49,657
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:55,032
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:58,103
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:00,240
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:02,176 --> 00:34:05,942
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:08,344
We are no spies.

321
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:11,451
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:14,085
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,358
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:20,689
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:23,832
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:29,160
We left none alive.

327
00:34:29,805 --> 00:34:32,774
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:39,476
Dead?

329
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:44,180
I am sorry.

330
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:52,057
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:53,863 --> 00:34:58,527
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:34:59,736 --> 00:35:01,328
Farewell.

333
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:08,774
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:09,246 --> 00:35:11,476
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:15,744
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:15,953 --> 00:35:17,944
We ride north!

337
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,373
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:26,216
We failed them.

339
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,436
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:45,972
And the other.

341
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,384
They crawled.

342
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:04,591
Their hands were bound.

343
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:18,577
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:37:34,064 --> 00:37:36,191
They ran over here.

345
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:41,031
They were followed.

346
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:45,971
The belt!

347
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,007
Run!

348
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:56,083
Tracks lead away from the battle...

349
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:02,986
...into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:38:03,896 --> 00:38:05,329
Fangorn?

351
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:08,125
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:28,877
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:39,031
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:46,260
Come here!

355
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:54,339
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:05,386
He's gone.

357
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:19,804
Merry!

358
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,690
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,356
Run, Merry!

360
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:58,478
Little Orcs.

361
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:00,981
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,051
Tree?

363
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,212
I am no tree!

364
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:08,617
I am an Ent.

365
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:11,319
A tree-herder.

366
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:13,863
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:15,396
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:17,367
Don't encourage it!

369
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:21,800
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:23,941
And whose side are you on?

371
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:26,169
Side?

372
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:29,244
I am on nobody's side...

373
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:34,950
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:40:35,753 --> 00:40:40,384
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:40:40,793 --> 00:40:43,193
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:40:43,362 --> 00:40:45,660
Hobbits?

377
00:40:46,899 --> 00:40:51,768
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:57,465
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:40:57,643 --> 00:40:59,770
They come with fire.

380
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:02,539
They come with axes.

381
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:07,550
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:41:07,754 --> 00:41:11,554
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

383
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:14,624
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:41:14,828 --> 00:41:16,625
Halflings!

385
00:41:16,796 --> 00:41:17,888
Shire-folk!

386
00:41:18,098 --> 00:41:20,430
Maybe you are...

387
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:24,363
...and maybe you aren't.

388
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:29,375
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,111
The White Wizard?

390
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:35,137
Saruman.

391
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:49,390
See? See?

392
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:52,031
We've led you out.

393
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,691
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,274
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:42:06,948 --> 00:42:08,677
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:14,852
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:17,652
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:42:18,427 --> 00:42:23,126
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:28,904
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:34,804
I found it. I did.

401
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:37,674
The way through the marshes.

402
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:41,373
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:42:41,585 --> 00:42:45,646
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:47,289
Come quickly.

405
00:42:47,491 --> 00:42:51,552
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:56,063
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:58,498
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,037
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:43:02,273 --> 00:43:06,505
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:43:07,111 --> 00:43:09,978
We are famished! Yes!

411
00:43:10,148 --> 00:43:14,448
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:30,925
Here.

413
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:34,128
What does it eats?

414
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,308
Is it tasty?

415
00:43:41,615 --> 00:43:44,209
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:43:44,484 --> 00:43:48,147
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:43:49,856 --> 00:43:53,883
We must starve!

418
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,426
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:59,392
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,433
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,403
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:10,875
Not like master.

423
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:14,339
Master cares.

424
00:44:15,516 --> 00:44:17,381
Master knows.

425
00:44:19,854 --> 00:44:21,822
Yes.

426
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:24,617
Precious.

427
00:44:28,196 --> 00:44:31,825
Once it takes hold of us...

428
00:44:33,702 --> 00:44:37,866
...it never lets go.

429
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:39,733
Don't touch me!

430
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,074
There are dead things!

431
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,007
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,810
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:29,088
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,923
A great battle long ago.

435
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,461
Dead Marshes.

436
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,397
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:41,834
This way.

438
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,804
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:50,412
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

440
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:54,711
...and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:46:20,914 --> 00:46:22,381
Frodo!

442
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:11,526
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

443
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,565
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

444
00:47:13,735 --> 00:47:15,600
Are you all right?

445
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:47,470
So bright.

446
00:47:47,671 --> 00:47:51,471
So beautiful.

447
00:47:51,642 --> 00:47:55,510
Our precious.

448
00:47:56,981 --> 00:47:58,471
What did you say?

449
00:47:58,682 --> 00:48:00,843
Master should be resting.

450
00:48:01,018 --> 00:48:05,079
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:48:07,057 --> 00:48:10,323
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,985
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:13,961
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:18,228
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home</i>

455
00:48:18,403 --> 00:48:19,961
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:48:20,172 --> 00:48:24,700
<i>They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead</i>

457
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:27,868
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,808
Were you?

459
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,281
Sméagol.

460
00:48:38,991 --> 00:48:41,516
What did you call me?

461
00:48:42,862 --> 00:48:45,626
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:48,565
A long time ago.

463
00:48:49,402 --> 00:48:51,563
My name.

464
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,128
My name.

465
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:03,482
Sméagol.

466
00:49:07,621 --> 00:49:09,248
Black Riders!

467
00:49:09,423 --> 00:49:10,754
Hide! Hide!

468
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,634
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:49:23,805 --> 00:49:27,434
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:30,871
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

471
00:49:31,045 --> 00:49:34,014
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:50:01,176 --> 00:50:02,268
Wraiths!

473
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:04,674
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:14,714
They are calling for it.

475
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:18,485
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,757
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:24,194
I'm here.

478
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:41,741
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,256
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:50:53,131 --> 00:50:54,996
Orc blood.

481
00:51:04,943 --> 00:51:06,706
These are strange tracks.

482
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:10,004
The air is so close in here.

483
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,584
This forest is old.

484
00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:16,378
Very old.

485
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:20,455
Full of memory...

486
00:51:23,062 --> 00:51:25,394
...and anger.

487
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:34,473
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:36,131
Gimli!

489
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,244
Lower your ax.

490
00:51:41,048 --> 00:51:43,812
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,342
The Elves began it.

492
00:51:46,553 --> 00:51:51,286
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:54,158
Talking trees.

494
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:57,822
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:01,162
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:52:15,116 --> 00:52:17,550
The White Wizard approaches.

497
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:28,059
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

498
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,904
We must be quick.

499
00:52:55,492 --> 00:52:59,121
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

500
00:52:59,696 --> 00:53:01,095
Where are they?

501
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:04,826
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

502
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:09,268
They met someone they did not expect.

503
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,567
Does that comfort you?

504
00:53:11,742 --> 00:53:13,710
Who are you?

505
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:17,147
Show yourself!

506
00:53:26,058 --> 00:53:28,049
It cannot be.

507
00:53:31,029 --> 00:53:31,996
Forgive me.

508
00:53:33,665 --> 00:53:35,599
I mistook you for Saruman.

509
00:53:36,368 --> 00:53:39,132
I am Saruman.

510
00:53:40,672 --> 00:53:44,540
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

511
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:47,001
You fell.

512
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:51,006
Through fire...

513
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:52,481
...and water.

514
00:53:53,953 --> 00:53:56,478
<i>From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...</i>

515
00:53:56,656 --> 00:54:00,353
<i>...I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.</i>

516
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,940
<i>Until at last I threw down
my enemy...</i>

517
00:54:19,113 --> 00:54:23,573
<i>...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.</i>

518
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,150
<i>Darkness took me...</i>

519
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:36,989
<i>...and I strayed out of thought
and time.</i>

520
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:40,826
<i>Stars wheeled overhead...</i>

521
00:54:41,102 --> 00:54:45,596
<i>...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.</i>

522
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,869
<i>But it was not the end.</i>

523
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,944
<i>I felt life in me again.</i>

524
00:54:54,883 --> 00:54:57,409
<i>I've been sent back...</i>

525
00:54:57,587 --> 00:54:59,145
...until my task is done.

526
00:54:59,522 --> 00:55:01,422
Gandalf.

527
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:04,082
Gandalf?

528
00:55:04,493 --> 00:55:06,290
Yes.

529
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:10,895
That was what they used to call me.

530
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:16,033
Gandalf the Grey.

531
00:55:17,373 --> 00:55:19,137
That was my name.

532
00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:20,742
Gandalf.

533
00:55:22,713 --> 00:55:24,772
I am Gandalf the White.

534
00:55:27,818 --> 00:55:30,878
And I come back to you now...

535
00:55:31,054 --> 00:55:33,545
...at the turn of the tide.

536
00:55:34,658 --> 00:55:37,627
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

537
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:41,559
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

538
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,525
That is no short distance!

539
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:48,033
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

540
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:50,299
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

541
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:53,911
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

542
00:55:54,078 --> 00:55:56,069
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

543
00:55:56,247 --> 00:56:00,411
...in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?

544
00:56:03,021 --> 00:56:06,185
I mean, charming...

545
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:09,088
...quite charming forest.

546
00:56:09,628 --> 00:56:13,291
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

547
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:17,868
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

548
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:21,473
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

549
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,973
...that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

550
00:56:25,144 --> 00:56:28,137
I n one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

551
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:31,909
You still speak in riddles.

552
00:56:34,754 --> 00:56:41,159
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

553
00:56:41,327 --> 00:56:44,956
The Ents are going to wake up...

554
00:56:45,498 --> 00:56:49,993
...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

555
00:56:50,805 --> 00:56:51,931
Oh, that's good.

556
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:54,835
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

557
00:56:55,943 --> 00:56:58,173
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

558
00:56:58,345 --> 00:57:01,940
I n fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

559
00:57:02,116 --> 00:57:05,847
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

560
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:29,576
That is one of the Mearas...

561
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:32,543
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

562
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:52,430
Shadowfax.

563
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:57,633
He is the lord of all horses...

564
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:03,144
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

565
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:20,990
<i>O rowan mine</i>

566
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:24,966
<i>I saw you shine</i>

567
00:58:25,136 --> 00:58:28,663
<i>Upon a summer's day</i>

568
00:58:29,774 --> 00:58:34,234
<i>Upon your head
How golden-red</i>

569
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:39,178
<i>The crown you bore aloft</i>

570
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,751
Such a beautiful verse.

571
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:46,824
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

572
00:58:46,992 --> 00:58:50,257
You might call it far, perhaps.

573
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:54,963
My home lies deep in the forest...

574
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:59,069
...near the roots of the mountain.

575
00:59:00,339 --> 00:59:04,003
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

576
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:08,203
And safe is where I'll keep you.

577
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:12,850
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

578
00:59:13,253 --> 00:59:16,245
It's one of my own compositions.

579
00:59:16,423 --> 00:59:17,617
Right.

580
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:23,923
<i>Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves</i>

581
00:59:24,097 --> 00:59:28,967
<i>And the dreams of trees unfold</i>

582
00:59:29,136 --> 00:59:35,598
<i>When woodland halls are green and cool</i>

583
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:39,871
<i>And the wind is in the West</i>

584
00:59:40,348 --> 00:59:43,010
<i>Come back to me</i>

585
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:48,011
<i>Come back to me</i>

586
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:54,618
<i>And say my land is best</i>

587
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:05,733
Sleep, little Shirelings.

588
01:00:05,908 --> 01:00:09,503
Heed no nightly noise.

589
01:00:09,711 --> 01:00:13,614
Sleep till morning light.

590
01:00:15,251 --> 01:00:19,415
I have business in the forest.

591
01:00:19,589 --> 01:00:25,118
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

592
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:31,026
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

593
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:37,037
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

594
01:00:46,483 --> 01:00:50,749
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

595
01:00:51,555 --> 01:00:54,149
Sauron will suffer no rival.

596
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:58,858
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

597
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,397
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

598
01:01:03,435 --> 01:01:05,403
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

599
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:08,130
The rumor has reached him.

600
01:01:08,306 --> 01:01:11,275
The heir of Númenor still lives.

601
01:01:12,243 --> 01:01:15,076
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

602
01:01:16,414 --> 01:01:18,575
He fears what you may become.

603
01:01:19,852 --> 01:01:23,288
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

604
01:01:23,456 --> 01:01:27,085
He will use his puppet Saruman
to destroy Rohan.

605
01:01:27,259 --> 01:01:28,749
War is coming.

606
01:01:28,928 --> 01:01:32,489
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

607
01:01:32,665 --> 01:01:35,099
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

608
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:38,964
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

609
01:01:39,138 --> 01:01:42,233
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

610
01:01:42,409 --> 01:01:47,108
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

611
01:01:47,948 --> 01:01:50,075
But for all their cunning...

612
01:01:50,283 --> 01:01:52,808
...we have one advantage.

613
01:01:54,988 --> 01:01:57,548
The Ring remains hidden.

614
01:01:58,592 --> 01:02:00,492
And that we should seek to destroy it...

615
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,629
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

616
01:02:04,232 --> 01:02:07,531
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

617
01:02:07,702 --> 01:02:09,192
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

618
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:13,466
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

619
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:16,269
We must trust now in Frodo.

620
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:18,275
Everything depends upon speed...

621
01:02:18,446 --> 01:02:21,438
...and the secrecy of his quest.

622
01:02:23,418 --> 01:02:26,752
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

623
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:30,387
Frodo must finish this task alone.

624
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,458
He's not alone.

625
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:35,324
Sam went with him.

626
01:02:35,998 --> 01:02:37,192
Did he?

627
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:41,996
Did he, indeed? Good.

628
01:02:42,604 --> 01:02:45,038
Yes, very good.

629
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:57,952
The Black Gate of Mordor.

630
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,158
Oh, save us.

631
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:12,197
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

632
01:03:14,438 --> 01:03:18,898
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

633
01:03:19,076 --> 01:03:22,512
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

634
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,908
I did.

635
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:34,682
That's it, then.

636
01:03:36,261 --> 01:03:37,558
We can't get past that.

637
01:04:22,743 --> 01:04:24,074
Look!

638
01:04:24,244 --> 01:04:25,711
The gate.

639
01:04:25,879 --> 01:04:27,073
It's opening!

640
01:04:34,521 --> 01:04:36,489
I can see a way down.

641
01:04:37,224 --> 01:04:39,317
Sam, no!

642
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:42,894
Master!

643
01:06:06,684 --> 01:06:10,211
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

644
01:06:10,988 --> 01:06:14,152
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

645
01:06:14,593 --> 01:06:16,458
- Now!
- No!

646
01:06:17,029 --> 01:06:18,997
No! No, master!

647
01:06:19,197 --> 01:06:22,166
They catch you! They catch you!

648
01:06:23,468 --> 01:06:26,028
Don't take it to him.

649
01:06:28,974 --> 01:06:31,704
He wants the precious.

650
01:06:31,877 --> 01:06:34,904
Always he is looking for it.

651
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:38,983
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

652
01:06:39,218 --> 01:06:43,120
But we mustn't let him have it.

653
01:06:49,529 --> 01:06:51,622
No! There's another way.

654
01:06:51,831 --> 01:06:54,493
More secret. A dark way.

655
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:58,465
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

656
01:06:58,939 --> 01:06:59,963
He's up to something.

657
01:07:00,574 --> 01:07:03,168
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

658
01:07:03,344 --> 01:07:06,074
Yes. There's a path...

659
01:07:06,246 --> 01:07:08,737
...and some stairs.

660
01:07:08,949 --> 01:07:10,610
And then...

661
01:07:10,784 --> 01:07:14,117
...a tunnel.

662
01:07:28,136 --> 01:07:29,933
He's led us this far, Sam.

663
01:07:30,105 --> 01:07:31,504
Mr. Frodo, no.

664
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,107
He's been true to his word.

665
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,174
No.

666
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:43,945
Lead the way, Sméagol.

667
01:07:44,553 --> 01:07:48,489
Good Sméagol always helps.

668
01:08:22,459 --> 01:08:23,448
Hello?

669
01:08:25,862 --> 01:08:27,922
Treebeard?

670
01:08:28,633 --> 01:08:29,964
Where has he gone?

671
01:08:30,168 --> 01:08:32,602
I had the loveliest dream last night.

672
01:08:33,237 --> 01:08:35,933
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

673
01:08:36,107 --> 01:08:38,598
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

674
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:41,044
...you were sick.

675
01:08:42,647 --> 01:08:45,480
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

676
01:08:48,986 --> 01:08:50,921
Did you hear that?

677
01:08:57,996 --> 01:08:59,395
There it is again.

678
01:09:00,332 --> 01:09:04,928
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

679
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,675
You just said something... Treeish.

680
01:09:11,844 --> 01:09:15,838
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

681
01:09:23,389 --> 01:09:25,254
You're taller.

682
01:09:25,792 --> 01:09:27,282
- Who?
- You!

683
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,087
- Than what?
- Than me!

684
01:09:29,596 --> 01:09:31,723
I've always been taller than you.

685
01:09:31,898 --> 01:09:36,529
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

686
01:09:37,404 --> 01:09:38,894
Please, Merry.

687
01:09:39,106 --> 01:09:42,940
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

688
01:09:43,511 --> 01:09:46,344
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

689
01:09:48,482 --> 01:09:50,746
3'8"!

690
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:54,517
Three-foot-eight.

691
01:09:57,592 --> 01:09:59,492
You did something.

692
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,892
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

693
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,303
Merry!

694
01:10:09,504 --> 01:10:11,836
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

695
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:15,909
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

696
01:10:16,077 --> 01:10:18,238
Give me it back. Merry!

697
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:21,447
What's happening?!

698
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,785
It's got my leg!

699
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,610
Merry!

700
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:46,600
Help!

701
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:55,248
Away with you.

702
01:10:55,419 --> 01:10:57,216
You should not be waking.

703
01:10:57,721 --> 01:11:02,590
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

704
01:11:03,193 --> 01:11:05,754
Go to sleep.

705
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:07,962
Away with you.

706
01:11:08,132 --> 01:11:11,431
Come, the forest is waking up.

707
01:11:12,003 --> 01:11:13,937
It isn't safe.

708
01:11:16,608 --> 01:11:20,544
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

709
01:11:20,712 --> 01:11:23,704
Anger festers in their hearts.

710
01:11:24,582 --> 01:11:26,209
Black are their thoughts.

711
01:11:26,384 --> 01:11:28,910
Strong is their hate.

712
01:11:29,088 --> 01:11:31,852
They will harm you if they can.

713
01:11:32,024 --> 01:11:35,585
There are too few of us now.

714
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:39,754
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

715
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:43,027
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

716
01:11:43,202 --> 01:11:46,399
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

717
01:11:46,572 --> 01:11:52,205
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

718
01:11:52,412 --> 01:11:57,645
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

719
01:11:57,917 --> 01:11:59,316
Oh, I'm sorry.

720
01:11:59,419 --> 01:12:03,355
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

721
01:12:03,523 --> 01:12:06,754
We lost them.

722
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:11,989
And now we cannot find them.

723
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:18,401
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

724
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:21,190
Can't say that I have.

725
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:23,690
You, Pip?

726
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,590
What do they look like?

727
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:34,690
I don't remember now.

728
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:54,991
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

729
01:12:55,791 --> 01:12:58,392
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

730
01:12:59,092 --> 01:13:01,992
<i>...whose mind is overthrown.</i>

731
01:13:02,192 --> 01:13:06,392
<i>Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.</i>

732
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:10,192
My lord, your son...

733
01:13:10,392 --> 01:13:12,592
...he is dead.

734
01:13:14,092 --> 01:13:15,892
My lord?

735
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:18,393
Uncle?

736
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:27,393
Will you not go to him?

737
01:13:30,593 --> 01:13:32,993
Will you do nothing?

738
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:35,093
Be careful what you say.

739
01:13:35,293 --> 01:13:37,494
Do not look for welcome here.

740
01:14:01,495 --> 01:14:05,695
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

741
01:14:05,895 --> 01:14:07,995
What a tragedy for the king...

742
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:11,195
...to lose his only son and heir.

743
01:14:12,295 --> 01:14:16,796
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

744
01:14:16,996 --> 01:14:21,896
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

745
01:14:22,096 --> 01:14:23,596
Leave me alone, snake!

746
01:14:24,996 --> 01:14:26,696
Oh, but you are alone.

747
01:14:28,296 --> 01:14:33,096
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

748
01:14:33,196 --> 01:14:36,697
...in the bitter watches of the night...

749
01:14:36,897 --> 01:14:40,497
...when all your life seems to shrink.

750
01:14:40,697 --> 01:14:44,897
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

751
01:14:45,097 --> 01:14:49,697
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

752
01:14:51,897 --> 01:14:53,798
So fair.

753
01:14:55,098 --> 01:14:56,498
So cold.

754
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:00,398
Like a morning of pale spring...

755
01:15:00,598 --> 01:15:03,998
...still clinging to winter's chill.

756
01:15:17,799 --> 01:15:20,299
Your words are poison.

757
01:16:52,904 --> 01:16:55,304
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

758
01:17:09,705 --> 01:17:13,505
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

759
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:17,605
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

760
01:17:34,906 --> 01:17:36,706
Your staff.

761
01:17:40,106 --> 01:17:43,606
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

762
01:18:02,407 --> 01:18:05,207
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

763
01:18:13,608 --> 01:18:15,108
He's a herald of woe.

764
01:18:15,308 --> 01:18:19,708
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

765
01:18:20,808 --> 01:18:22,308
...Théoden King.

766
01:18:23,008 --> 01:18:25,508
He's not welcome.

767
01:18:26,409 --> 01:18:31,809
Why should I welcome you...

768
01:18:32,309 --> 01:18:35,909
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

769
01:18:36,109 --> 01:18:39,409
A just question, my liege.

770
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:42,509
Late is the hour...

771
01:18:42,609 --> 01:18:46,610
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

772
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:49,510
Láthspell I name him.

773
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:52,510
Ill news is an ill guest.

774
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:57,310
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

775
01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:59,410
I have not passed
through fire and death...

776
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:02,710
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

777
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:05,811
His staff.

778
01:19:06,011 --> 01:19:10,111
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

779
01:19:13,511 --> 01:19:15,411
Théoden...

780
01:19:16,011 --> 01:19:18,511
...son of Thengel...

781
01:19:20,311 --> 01:19:22,711
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

782
01:19:25,712 --> 01:19:28,912
I would stay still if I were you.

783
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:31,212
Hearken to me!

784
01:19:36,712 --> 01:19:38,812
I release you...

785
01:19:39,012 --> 01:19:41,012
...from the spell.

786
01:19:52,613 --> 01:19:55,613
You have no power here...

787
01:19:55,813 --> 01:19:59,413
...Gandalf the Grey.

788
01:20:04,814 --> 01:20:09,914
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

789
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,814
Wait.

790
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:26,115
If I go, Théoden dies.

791
01:20:26,815 --> 01:20:29,015
You did not kill me...

792
01:20:29,215 --> 01:20:31,415
...you will not kill him.

793
01:20:35,315 --> 01:20:37,015
Rohan is mine.

794
01:20:38,515 --> 01:20:39,815
Be gone.

795
01:21:24,318 --> 01:21:26,418
I know your face.

796
01:21:31,018 --> 01:21:32,318
Éowyn.

797
01:21:34,618 --> 01:21:35,918
Éowyn.

798
01:21:44,119 --> 01:21:45,319
Gandalf?

799
01:21:45,919 --> 01:21:48,719
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

800
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,720
Dark have been my dreams of late.

801
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:12,620
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

802
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:15,720
...if they grasped your sword.

803
01:23:00,823 --> 01:23:02,823
I've only...

804
01:23:03,023 --> 01:23:06,123
...ever served you, my lord.

805
01:23:06,323 --> 01:23:11,223
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

806
01:23:12,323 --> 01:23:14,223
Send me not from your sight.

807
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:19,224
No, my lord! No, my lord.

808
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,624
Let him go.

809
01:23:21,324 --> 01:23:24,624
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

810
01:23:33,724 --> 01:23:36,025
Get out of my way!

811
01:23:38,325 --> 01:23:41,425
Hail, Théoden King!

812
01:24:06,026 --> 01:24:08,526
Where is Théodred?

813
01:24:11,626 --> 01:24:14,127
Where is my son?

814
01:25:41,331 --> 01:25:43,131
Simbelmynë.

815
01:25:48,231 --> 01:25:51,832
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forbearers.

816
01:25:55,732 --> 01:25:58,732
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

817
01:26:00,732 --> 01:26:04,632
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

818
01:26:05,432 --> 01:26:09,833
The young perish and the old linger.

819
01:26:10,433 --> 01:26:12,533
That I should live...

820
01:26:12,633 --> 01:26:16,033
...to see the last days of my house.

821
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:21,133
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

822
01:26:24,233 --> 01:26:27,633
No parent should have to bury
their child.

823
01:26:44,334 --> 01:26:46,234
He was strong in life.

824
01:26:47,334 --> 01:26:50,835
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

825
01:27:35,537 --> 01:27:37,437
They had no warning.

826
01:27:37,537 --> 01:27:39,937
They were unarmed.

827
01:27:40,437 --> 01:27:44,437
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

828
01:27:45,437 --> 01:27:47,338
Rick, cot and tree.

829
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:49,938
Where is Mama?

830
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:54,938
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

831
01:27:55,138 --> 01:27:59,438
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

832
01:28:01,038 --> 01:28:04,038
Ride out and meet him head on.

833
01:28:04,838 --> 01:28:08,239
Draw him away from your women
and children.

834
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,239
You must fight.

835
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:14,239
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

836
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:16,039
Éomer is loyal to you.

837
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:18,939
His men will return
and fight for their king.

838
01:28:19,139 --> 01:28:23,039
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

839
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,940
Éomer cannot help us.

840
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:31,340
I know what it is you want of me...

841
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:34,740
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

842
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,140
I will not risk open war.

843
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:43,740
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

844
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:49,641
When last I looked...

845
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:53,741
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

846
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:02,741
Then what is the king's decision?

847
01:29:08,342 --> 01:29:09,742
<i>By order of the king...</i>

848
01:29:09,842 --> 01:29:11,342
...the city must empty.

849
01:29:12,542 --> 01:29:15,442
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

850
01:29:15,742 --> 01:29:19,642
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

851
01:29:19,842 --> 01:29:21,242
Helm's Deep.

852
01:29:21,442 --> 01:29:25,043
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

853
01:29:25,143 --> 01:29:27,143
Who will defend them if not their king?

854
01:29:27,343 --> 01:29:29,743
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

855
01:29:29,943 --> 01:29:31,743
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

856
01:29:31,943 --> 01:29:35,843
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

857
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:38,143
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

858
01:29:38,343 --> 01:29:40,543
What they will get is a massacre.

859
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,544
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

860
01:29:45,444 --> 01:29:48,844
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

861
01:29:49,244 --> 01:29:52,144
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

862
01:29:52,644 --> 01:29:55,444
The people of Rohan will need you.

863
01:29:55,744 --> 01:29:58,244
The defenses have to hold.

864
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,444
They will hold.

865
01:30:05,445 --> 01:30:07,745
The Grey Pilgrim.

866
01:30:07,845 --> 01:30:10,545
That's what they used to call me.

867
01:30:10,745 --> 01:30:15,745
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

868
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:19,645
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

869
01:30:20,145 --> 01:30:23,446
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

870
01:30:24,346 --> 01:30:27,046
At dawn, look to the east.

871
01:30:27,246 --> 01:30:28,746
Go.

872
01:30:56,147 --> 01:30:59,447
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

873
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:40,550
His name is Brego.

874
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:43,950
He was my cousin's horse.

875
01:31:44,150 --> 01:31:45,950
Brego.

876
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:03,151
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

877
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:06,551
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

878
01:32:07,651 --> 01:32:10,051
You speak as one of their own.

879
01:32:11,851 --> 01:32:14,251
I was raised in Rivendell...

880
01:32:14,551 --> 01:32:16,051
...for a time.

881
01:32:19,352 --> 01:32:21,452
Turn this fellow free.

882
01:32:22,052 --> 01:32:24,552
He's seen enough of war.

883
01:32:36,353 --> 01:32:39,253
Gandalf the White.

884
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:41,753
Gandalf the Fool!

885
01:32:43,053 --> 01:32:47,053
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

886
01:32:48,353 --> 01:32:52,253
There were three
who followed the wizard.

887
01:32:52,653 --> 01:32:58,054
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

888
01:32:58,354 --> 01:33:01,154
You stink of horse.

889
01:33:06,454 --> 01:33:08,254
The Man...

890
01:33:10,354 --> 01:33:14,554
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

891
01:33:14,654 --> 01:33:18,455
One of the Dúnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

892
01:33:18,655 --> 01:33:20,455
His cloth was poor.

893
01:33:21,355 --> 01:33:26,455
And yet he bore a strange ring.

894
01:33:27,555 --> 01:33:31,155
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

895
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:37,156
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

896
01:33:37,356 --> 01:33:39,256
The Ring of Barahir.

897
01:33:40,256 --> 01:33:43,756
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

898
01:33:43,956 --> 01:33:47,356
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

899
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:50,256
The line was broken years ago.

900
01:33:51,556 --> 01:33:53,156
It matters not.

901
01:33:53,256 --> 01:33:55,857
The world of Men shall fall.

902
01:33:55,957 --> 01:33:57,857
It will begin at Edoras.

903
01:34:07,057 --> 01:34:08,957
I am ready, Gamling.

904
01:34:09,157 --> 01:34:11,557
Bring my horse.

905
01:34:14,758 --> 01:34:16,158
This is not a defeat.

906
01:34:18,558 --> 01:34:19,758
We will return.

907
01:34:25,258 --> 01:34:27,658
We will return.

908
01:34:51,059 --> 01:34:52,960
You have some skill with a blade.

909
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:03,560
Women of this country learned long ago:

910
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:06,360
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

911
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,360
I fear neither death nor pain.

912
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,661
What do you fear, my lady?

913
01:35:15,061 --> 01:35:16,961
A cage.

914
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:22,061
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

915
01:35:22,261 --> 01:35:26,161
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

916
01:35:29,561 --> 01:35:31,662
You're a daughter of kings...

917
01:35:32,862 --> 01:35:36,162
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

918
01:35:41,462 --> 01:35:43,962
I do not think that would be your fate.

919
01:36:17,064 --> 01:36:20,064
<i>Théoden will not stay at Edoras.</i>

920
01:36:20,264 --> 01:36:22,364
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

921
01:36:22,564 --> 01:36:25,464
He will expect an attack on the city.

922
01:36:26,764 --> 01:36:29,965
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

923
01:36:30,165 --> 01:36:32,565
...the great fortress of Rohan.

924
01:36:33,765 --> 01:36:38,165
<i>It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.</i>

925
01:36:39,565 --> 01:36:41,265
<i>They will be slow.</i>

926
01:36:41,665 --> 01:36:46,065
They will have women and children
with them.

927
01:36:49,966 --> 01:36:52,266
Send out your Warg-riders.

928
01:37:07,067 --> 01:37:09,967
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

929
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:12,867
- Why do you do that?
- What?

930
01:37:12,967 --> 01:37:15,567
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

931
01:37:15,967 --> 01:37:17,967
Because.

932
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:21,667
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

933
01:37:21,867 --> 01:37:24,067
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

934
01:37:24,467 --> 01:37:27,268
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

935
01:37:27,468 --> 01:37:29,668
You have no idea what it did to him...

936
01:37:29,868 --> 01:37:32,368
...what it's still doing to him.

937
01:37:34,568 --> 01:37:36,668
I want to help him, Sam.

938
01:37:36,868 --> 01:37:38,168
Why?

939
01:37:43,468 --> 01:37:46,569
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

940
01:37:50,769 --> 01:37:52,769
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

941
01:37:52,869 --> 01:37:55,669
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

942
01:38:02,569 --> 01:38:06,770
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

943
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:08,670
I do.

944
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:12,670
It's the Ring.

945
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:14,770
You can't take your eyes off it.

946
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:17,470
I've seen you.

947
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:21,770
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

948
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:25,771
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

949
01:38:25,971 --> 01:38:28,671
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

950
01:38:28,871 --> 01:38:31,771
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

951
01:38:31,971 --> 01:38:33,671
Mine! My own!

952
01:38:34,471 --> 01:38:36,571
Can't you hear yourself?

953
01:38:36,771 --> 01:38:38,471
Don't you know who you sound like?

954
01:38:48,772 --> 01:38:50,872
We wants it.

955
01:38:51,072 --> 01:38:53,772
We needs it.

956
01:38:53,972 --> 01:38:58,772
Must have the precious.

957
01:38:58,872 --> 01:39:02,272
They stole it from us.

958
01:39:02,472 --> 01:39:05,873
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

959
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:09,873
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

960
01:39:10,073 --> 01:39:13,373
No. Not master.

961
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:17,373
Yes, precious. False.

962
01:39:17,573 --> 01:39:21,973
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

963
01:39:23,174 --> 01:39:25,674
Master's my friend.

964
01:39:25,774 --> 01:39:30,874
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

965
01:39:32,174 --> 01:39:34,674
Not listening. I'm not listening.

966
01:39:34,774 --> 01:39:38,774
You're a liar and a thief.

967
01:39:39,474 --> 01:39:40,974
No.

968
01:39:41,975 --> 01:39:44,875
Murderer.

969
01:39:47,375 --> 01:39:48,375
Go away.

970
01:39:48,575 --> 01:39:50,875
Go away?

971
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:55,675
I hate you.

972
01:39:55,875 --> 01:39:58,275
I hate you.

973
01:39:58,575 --> 01:40:01,876
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

974
01:40:02,076 --> 01:40:03,876
I saved us.

975
01:40:04,076 --> 01:40:08,576
It was me. We survived because of me.

976
01:40:09,776 --> 01:40:13,376
Not anymore.

977
01:40:14,776 --> 01:40:16,276
What did you say?

978
01:40:18,376 --> 01:40:22,277
Master looks after us now.

979
01:40:22,377 --> 01:40:25,877
We don't need you.

980
01:40:26,577 --> 01:40:28,177
What?

981
01:40:28,377 --> 01:40:30,077
Leave now...

982
01:40:30,277 --> 01:40:34,077
...and never come back.

983
01:40:34,277 --> 01:40:35,277
No.

984
01:40:35,777 --> 01:40:39,978
Leave now and never come back.

985
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:48,478
Leave now and never come back!

986
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:03,179
We told him to go away.

987
01:41:03,279 --> 01:41:06,279
And away he goes, precious.

988
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:08,479
Gone! Gone! Gone!

989
01:41:08,579 --> 01:41:10,479
Sméagol is free!

990
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:16,779
Look.

991
01:41:16,979 --> 01:41:21,480
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

992
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,480
They are young.

993
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,180
They are tender. They are nice.

994
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:38,881
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

995
01:41:41,581 --> 01:41:43,181
You'll make him sick, you will...

996
01:41:44,381 --> 01:41:46,581
...behaving like that.

997
01:41:48,981 --> 01:41:51,781
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

998
01:41:55,981 --> 01:41:57,482
What's it doing?

999
01:41:58,282 --> 01:42:00,882
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1000
01:42:01,082 --> 01:42:03,182
It ruins it.

1001
01:42:03,382 --> 01:42:07,082
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1002
01:42:11,182 --> 01:42:13,782
What we need is a few good taters.

1003
01:42:14,582 --> 01:42:17,683
What's taters, precious?

1004
01:42:17,883 --> 01:42:19,583
What's taters? Eh?

1005
01:42:19,783 --> 01:42:21,483
Po-ta-toes.

1006
01:42:21,783 --> 01:42:25,083
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1007
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:32,083
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1008
01:42:33,383 --> 01:42:35,283
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1009
01:42:35,684 --> 01:42:37,784
Oh, yes, we could.

1010
01:42:37,984 --> 01:42:41,484
Spoil a nice fish.

1011
01:42:42,784 --> 01:42:45,384
Give it to us raw...

1012
01:42:45,584 --> 01:42:48,584
...and wriggling.

1013
01:42:48,784 --> 01:42:51,884
You keep nasty chips.

1014
01:42:52,884 --> 01:42:54,885
You're hopeless.

1015
01:43:07,385 --> 01:43:08,885
Mr. Frodo?

1016
01:43:26,786 --> 01:43:29,486
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1017
01:43:29,686 --> 01:43:32,086
Servants of Sauron.

1018
01:43:32,886 --> 01:43:35,087
They are called to Mordor.

1019
01:43:35,287 --> 01:43:38,287
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1020
01:43:38,487 --> 01:43:41,687
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1021
01:43:43,287 --> 01:43:46,887
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1022
01:43:47,087 --> 01:43:52,287
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1023
01:43:52,487 --> 01:43:55,588
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1024
01:43:55,788 --> 01:43:56,988
Mr. Frodo.

1025
01:43:57,488 --> 01:43:59,088
Look.

1026
01:44:02,688 --> 01:44:04,988
It's an oliphaunt.

1027
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:16,189
No one at home will believe this.

1028
01:44:27,389 --> 01:44:29,289
Sméagol?

1029
01:45:09,591 --> 01:45:12,092
We've lingered here too long.

1030
01:45:15,092 --> 01:45:16,392
Come on, Sam.

1031
01:45:29,893 --> 01:45:32,593
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1032
01:45:34,293 --> 01:45:39,393
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1033
01:45:39,593 --> 01:45:42,493
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1034
01:45:43,893 --> 01:45:47,293
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1035
01:45:47,393 --> 01:45:49,494
The enemy?

1036
01:45:51,594 --> 01:45:55,094
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1037
01:45:57,494 --> 01:45:59,594
You wonder what his name is...

1038
01:46:01,094 --> 01:46:03,394
...where he came from.

1039
01:46:05,294 --> 01:46:07,794
And if he was really evil at heart.

1040
01:46:09,395 --> 01:46:12,895
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1041
01:46:14,495 --> 01:46:16,995
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1042
01:46:19,195 --> 01:46:20,695
...in peace.

1043
01:46:24,295 --> 01:46:27,295
War will make corpses of us all.

1044
01:46:27,496 --> 01:46:29,496
Bind their hands.

1045
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:39,059
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1046
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:42,958
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1047
01:46:43,159 --> 01:46:46,258
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1048
01:46:46,659 --> 01:46:48,558
It's the beards.

1049
01:46:48,758 --> 01:46:50,958
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1050
01:46:51,058 --> 01:46:53,957
...that there are no Dwarf women...

1051
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:58,358
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1052
01:47:00,058 --> 01:47:01,957
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

1053
01:47:08,057 --> 01:47:10,257
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1054
01:47:10,756 --> 01:47:12,757
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1055
01:47:14,756 --> 01:47:18,555
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1056
01:47:18,856 --> 01:47:21,556
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1057
01:47:21,755 --> 01:47:24,055
Cut down by Orcs.

1058
01:47:24,255 --> 01:47:27,255
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1059
01:47:27,855 --> 01:47:32,455
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1060
01:47:32,654 --> 01:47:37,154
Doomed to wait upon an old man
who should have loved her as a father.

1061
01:47:47,253 --> 01:47:49,553
Gimli.

1062
01:47:49,753 --> 01:47:51,853
No, I couldn't

1063
01:47:51,953 --> 01:47:53,853
I really couldn't.

1064
01:47:58,353 --> 01:47:59,952
I made some stew.

1065
01:48:00,153 --> 01:48:03,352
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1066
01:48:11,152 --> 01:48:13,251
Thank you.

1067
01:48:33,749 --> 01:48:36,249
- It's good.
- Really?

1068
01:48:40,249 --> 01:48:43,648
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1069
01:48:44,949 --> 01:48:48,948
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1070
01:48:49,448 --> 01:48:51,948
But he must be mistaken.

1071
01:48:52,148 --> 01:48:56,547
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1072
01:48:57,748 --> 01:49:00,948
Then you must be at least 60.

1073
01:49:03,047 --> 01:49:04,547
Seventy?

1074
01:49:05,046 --> 01:49:06,646
But you cannot be 80!

1075
01:49:10,046 --> 01:49:11,346
Eighty-seven.

1076
01:49:14,446 --> 01:49:16,546
You are one of the Dúnedain.

1077
01:49:17,645 --> 01:49:20,745
A descendant of Númenor,
blessed with long life.

1078
01:49:22,046 --> 01:49:24,646
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1079
01:49:25,346 --> 01:49:27,045
There are few of us left.

1080
01:49:27,245 --> 01:49:30,045
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1081
01:49:30,745 --> 01:49:34,144
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1082
01:49:48,843 --> 01:49:52,943
<i>The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.</i>

1083
01:49:53,743 --> 01:49:57,242
<i>It is mine to give to whom I will.</i>

1084
01:49:59,042 --> 01:50:01,442
<i>Like my heart.</i>

1085
01:50:02,842 --> 01:50:05,542
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

1086
01:50:05,741 --> 01:50:08,241
I am asleep.

1087
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,641
This is a dream.

1088
01:50:18,841 --> 01:50:22,041
Then it is a good dream.

1089
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:36,139
Sleep.

1090
01:51:39,134 --> 01:51:41,034
Arwen...

1091
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:32,330
Where is she?

1092
01:52:33,429 --> 01:52:35,929
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1093
01:52:39,229 --> 01:52:41,928
<i>Our time here is ending.</i>

1094
01:52:42,728 --> 01:52:45,228
Arwen's time is ending.

1095
01:52:46,028 --> 01:52:47,228
Let her go.

1096
01:52:47,428 --> 01:52:49,428
Let her take the ship into the west.

1097
01:52:49,628 --> 01:52:52,728
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1098
01:52:52,828 --> 01:52:54,627
There it will be ever green.

1099
01:52:56,127 --> 01:52:58,527
But never more than memory.

1100
01:52:59,827 --> 01:53:02,827
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1101
01:53:03,027 --> 01:53:06,626
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1102
01:53:06,827 --> 01:53:09,126
She belongs with her people.

1103
01:53:57,423 --> 01:53:59,223
Why are you saying this?

1104
01:54:00,822 --> 01:54:04,021
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1105
01:54:05,422 --> 01:54:08,121
It was a dream, Arwen.

1106
01:54:08,522 --> 01:54:09,921
Nothing more.

1107
01:54:11,321 --> 01:54:14,521
I don't believe you.

1108
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,420
This belongs to you.

1109
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:29,720
It was a gift.

1110
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,820
Keep it.

1111
01:54:36,319 --> 01:54:37,519
My lord?

1112
01:54:40,318 --> 01:54:44,919
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1113
01:55:08,417 --> 01:55:09,916
What is it?

1114
01:55:11,416 --> 01:55:13,415
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

1115
01:55:30,014 --> 01:55:32,015
Wargs!

1116
01:55:44,513 --> 01:55:46,213
A scout!

1117
01:55:52,513 --> 01:55:55,113
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1118
01:55:56,412 --> 01:55:58,612
Get them out of here!

1119
01:56:03,412 --> 01:56:05,412
All riders to the head of the column.

1120
01:56:06,112 --> 01:56:08,111
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1121
01:56:08,311 --> 01:56:10,011
Come on!

1122
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:24,310
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1123
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:25,910
- I can fight.
- No!

1124
01:56:28,609 --> 01:56:30,710
You must do this, for me.

1125
01:56:32,709 --> 01:56:34,309
Follow me!

1126
01:56:37,909 --> 01:56:42,209
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1127
01:56:42,409 --> 01:56:45,008
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1128
01:57:57,202 --> 01:57:59,502
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1129
01:58:02,301 --> 01:58:03,901
That one counts as mine!

1130
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,300
Stinking creature.

1131
01:59:49,393 --> 01:59:51,292
Aragorn!

1132
01:59:56,092 --> 01:59:57,592
Aragorn?

1133
02:00:11,491 --> 02:00:14,491
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1134
02:00:14,591 --> 02:00:16,091
He's...

1135
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:18,190
...dead.

1136
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:21,790
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1137
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:26,689
You lie.

1138
02:01:00,586 --> 02:01:02,186
Get the wounded on horses.

1139
02:01:03,487 --> 02:01:06,587
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1140
02:01:07,086 --> 02:01:09,187
Leave the dead.

1141
02:01:16,585 --> 02:01:18,085
Come.

1142
02:01:28,284 --> 02:01:29,784
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1143
02:01:29,984 --> 02:01:32,885
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1144
02:01:35,484 --> 02:01:37,284
We're safe!

1145
02:01:38,784 --> 02:01:41,683
We're safe, my lady.

1146
02:01:41,883 --> 02:01:43,084
Thank you.

1147
02:02:27,379 --> 02:02:28,780
- Mama!
- Éothain!

1148
02:02:28,979 --> 02:02:30,480
Freda!

1149
02:02:36,179 --> 02:02:39,079
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1150
02:02:42,979 --> 02:02:44,278
Take it to the caves.

1151
02:02:44,478 --> 02:02:47,278
Make way for the king.

1152
02:02:48,278 --> 02:02:52,077
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

1153
02:02:59,977 --> 02:03:03,776
So few. So few of you have returned.

1154
02:03:06,476 --> 02:03:08,776
Our people are safe.

1155
02:03:10,076 --> 02:03:12,676
We have paid for it with many lives.

1156
02:03:13,576 --> 02:03:15,076
My lady.

1157
02:03:18,775 --> 02:03:21,075
Lord Aragorn...

1158
02:03:21,275 --> 02:03:22,475
...where is he?

1159
02:03:24,475 --> 02:03:25,974
He fell.

1160
02:03:48,672 --> 02:03:51,673
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1161
02:03:51,772 --> 02:03:54,773
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1162
02:03:54,972 --> 02:03:58,072
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

1163
02:03:58,272 --> 02:04:00,872
Get them into the caves.

1164
02:04:01,672 --> 02:04:06,572
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1165
02:04:08,571 --> 02:04:11,971
<i>Helm's Deep has one weakness.</i>

1166
02:04:12,171 --> 02:04:14,471
<i>Its outer wall is solid rock...</i>

1167
02:04:14,670 --> 02:04:17,771
<i>...but for a small culvert
at its base...</i>

1168
02:04:17,970 --> 02:04:20,670
<i>...which is little more than a drain.</i>

1169
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:27,770
How? How can fire undo stone?

1170
02:04:27,970 --> 02:04:32,469
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1171
02:04:36,068 --> 02:04:40,068
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1172
02:04:40,168 --> 02:04:43,769
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1173
02:04:43,868 --> 02:04:46,468
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

1174
02:04:46,668 --> 02:04:48,068
Tens of thousands.

1175
02:04:48,268 --> 02:04:52,268
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1176
02:05:04,267 --> 02:05:07,367
A new power is rising.

1177
02:05:07,566 --> 02:05:10,566
Its victory is at hand.

1178
02:05:16,166 --> 02:05:18,265
This night...

1179
02:05:18,665 --> 02:05:23,065
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1180
02:05:23,165 --> 02:05:26,564
March to Helm's Deep!

1181
02:05:26,764 --> 02:05:30,164
Leave none alive!

1182
02:05:32,664 --> 02:05:35,163
To war!

1183
02:05:39,064 --> 02:05:43,563
There will be no dawn for Men.

1184
02:06:00,762 --> 02:06:02,761
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1185
02:06:03,061 --> 02:06:06,161
There is always smoke rising...

1186
02:06:06,361 --> 02:06:10,261
...from Isengard these days.

1187
02:06:10,461 --> 02:06:12,061
Isengard?

1188
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:14,161
There was a time...

1189
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:17,960
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1190
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:21,560
But now he has a mind of metal...

1191
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:24,660
...and wheels.

1192
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:29,859
He no longer cares for growing things.

1193
02:06:30,059 --> 02:06:31,860
What is it?

1194
02:06:36,858 --> 02:06:39,058
It's Saruman's army.

1195
02:06:39,258 --> 02:06:40,758
The war has started.

1196
02:07:19,155 --> 02:07:23,555
<i>May the grace of the Valar
protect you.</i>

1197
02:07:55,852 --> 02:07:57,652
Brego.

1198
02:08:23,850 --> 02:08:25,049
Arwen.

1199
02:08:34,749 --> 02:08:36,549
I have made my choice.

1200
02:08:43,048 --> 02:08:45,848
He is not coming back.

1201
02:08:47,348 --> 02:08:50,648
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1202
02:08:51,647 --> 02:08:54,547
There is still hope.

1203
02:08:58,746 --> 02:09:02,547
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1204
02:09:05,946 --> 02:09:08,846
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

1205
02:09:09,046 --> 02:09:11,546
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

1206
02:09:11,746 --> 02:09:16,445
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1207
02:09:16,646 --> 02:09:19,645
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1208
02:09:19,845 --> 02:09:22,845
...Aragorn will die.

1209
02:09:25,644 --> 02:09:28,144
<i>And there will be no comfort
for you...</i>

1210
02:09:28,445 --> 02:09:32,544
<i>...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.</i>

1211
02:09:35,344 --> 02:09:38,143
<i>He will come to death...</i>

1212
02:09:38,243 --> 02:09:40,843
<i>...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...</i>

1213
02:09:41,043 --> 02:09:45,743
<i>...in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.</i>

1214
02:09:54,842 --> 02:09:58,741
<i>But you, my daughter...</i>

1215
02:09:59,641 --> 02:10:04,641
<i>...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...</i>

1216
02:10:04,842 --> 02:10:08,841
<i>...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.</i>

1217
02:10:11,241 --> 02:10:13,641
<i>Here you will dwell...</i>

1218
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:18,740
<i>...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...</i>

1219
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:22,439
<i>...until all the world is changed...</i>

1220
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:27,139
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1221
02:10:35,639 --> 02:10:36,838
Arwen.

1222
02:10:43,438 --> 02:10:45,738
There is nothing for you here...

1223
02:10:46,438 --> 02:10:48,537
...only death.

1224
02:12:21,930 --> 02:12:25,629
<i>The power of the enemy is growing.</i>

1225
02:12:25,729 --> 02:12:28,430
<i>Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...</i>

1226
02:12:28,530 --> 02:12:31,929
<i>...to destroy the people of Rohan.</i>

1227
02:12:34,029 --> 02:12:37,628
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.</i>

1228
02:12:42,028 --> 02:12:45,328
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...</i>

1229
02:12:46,528 --> 02:12:49,427
<i>...the last free kingdom of Men.</i>

1230
02:12:49,628 --> 02:12:54,027
<i>His war on this country
will come swiftly.</i>

1231
02:12:57,727 --> 02:13:00,827
<i>He senses the Ring is close.</i>

1232
02:13:01,026 --> 02:13:04,526
<i>The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.</i>

1233
02:13:04,626 --> 02:13:08,726
<i>In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...</i>

1234
02:13:10,226 --> 02:13:14,126
...the quest will claim his life.

1235
02:13:14,326 --> 02:13:16,425
You know this.

1236
02:13:17,125 --> 02:13:19,925
<i>You have foreseen it.</i>

1237
02:13:22,025 --> 02:13:25,524
<i>It is the risk we all took.</i>

1238
02:13:29,824 --> 02:13:34,024
<i>In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.</i>

1239
02:13:35,224 --> 02:13:39,623
<i>It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.</i>

1240
02:13:39,823 --> 02:13:45,222
<i>Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.</i>

1241
02:13:45,423 --> 02:13:49,023
<i>The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...</i>

1242
02:13:49,222 --> 02:13:53,322
<i>...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.</i>

1243
02:13:55,722 --> 02:13:57,622
<i>It is close now.</i>

1244
02:13:57,722 --> 02:14:02,021
<i>So close to achieving its goal.</i>

1245
02:14:05,121 --> 02:14:08,721
<i>For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...</i>

1246
02:14:08,921 --> 02:14:13,020
<i>...even unto to the ending
of the world.</i>

1247
02:14:14,921 --> 02:14:16,720
<i>The time of the Elves...</i>

1248
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:18,820
<i>...is over.</i>

1249
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:23,320
<i>Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?</i>

1250
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:28,519
<i>Do we let them stand alone?</i>

1251
02:14:33,119 --> 02:14:34,419
What news?

1252
02:14:34,619 --> 02:14:37,418
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1253
02:14:37,618 --> 02:14:40,418
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1254
02:14:40,618 --> 02:14:44,618
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1255
02:14:44,818 --> 02:14:47,218
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1256
02:14:47,517 --> 02:14:49,718
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1257
02:14:49,817 --> 02:14:53,217
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1258
02:14:54,417 --> 02:14:57,916
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1259
02:14:58,117 --> 02:15:01,116
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1260
02:15:03,316 --> 02:15:05,516
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1261
02:15:05,716 --> 02:15:08,416
Sauron from Mordor.

1262
02:15:09,715 --> 02:15:12,915
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1263
02:15:13,115 --> 02:15:14,815
Gondor is weak.

1264
02:15:14,916 --> 02:15:18,115
Sauron will strike us soon.

1265
02:15:18,815 --> 02:15:20,714
And he will strike hard.

1266
02:15:21,115 --> 02:15:25,215
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1267
02:15:39,113 --> 02:15:41,313
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1268
02:15:41,513 --> 02:15:44,213
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1269
02:15:44,413 --> 02:15:46,712
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1270
02:15:53,512 --> 02:15:55,311
Speak.

1271
02:15:56,412 --> 02:15:59,012
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1272
02:15:59,311 --> 02:16:02,312
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1273
02:16:02,811 --> 02:16:04,311
Your bodyguard?

1274
02:16:04,511 --> 02:16:06,311
His gardener.

1275
02:16:06,911 --> 02:16:08,911
And where is your skulking friend?

1276
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:12,710
That gangrel creature.

1277
02:16:13,010 --> 02:16:15,011
He had an ill-favored look.

1278
02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:18,610
There was no other.

1279
02:16:22,710 --> 02:16:25,110
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1280
02:16:28,410 --> 02:16:31,509
One we lost in Moria...

1281
02:16:32,508 --> 02:16:34,108
...two were my kin...

1282
02:16:34,309 --> 02:16:38,008
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1283
02:16:38,208 --> 02:16:42,108
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1284
02:16:47,108 --> 02:16:48,908
You're a friend of Boromir?

1285
02:16:51,308 --> 02:16:52,807
Yes.

1286
02:16:53,907 --> 02:16:55,007
For my part.

1287
02:17:01,507 --> 02:17:04,406
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1288
02:17:06,406 --> 02:17:07,905
Dead?

1289
02:17:08,106 --> 02:17:10,106
How? When?

1290
02:17:10,405 --> 02:17:13,005
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1291
02:17:13,405 --> 02:17:17,205
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1292
02:17:20,005 --> 02:17:26,404
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1293
02:17:26,604 --> 02:17:29,704
It was cloven in two.

1294
02:17:31,304 --> 02:17:34,703
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1295
02:17:36,804 --> 02:17:38,604
He was my brother.

1296
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:30,499
Boromir!

1297
02:18:30,999 --> 02:18:32,899
Boromir!

1298
02:18:37,098 --> 02:18:40,898
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1299
02:18:41,098 --> 02:18:44,698
A place of light and beauty and music.

1300
02:18:44,898 --> 02:18:47,198
And so it shall be once more!

1301
02:18:49,797 --> 02:18:52,397
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1302
02:18:52,697 --> 02:18:56,996
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1303
02:19:00,796 --> 02:19:06,496
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1304
02:19:06,896 --> 02:19:08,795
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1305
02:19:08,996 --> 02:19:11,795
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1306
02:19:20,594 --> 02:19:23,295
Good speech. Nice and short.

1307
02:19:23,495 --> 02:19:26,394
Leaves more time for drinking!

1308
02:19:26,695 --> 02:19:30,894
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1309
02:19:34,394 --> 02:19:36,493
Remember today, little brother.

1310
02:19:36,693 --> 02:19:39,693
Today, life is good.

1311
02:19:43,893 --> 02:19:45,493
What?

1312
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:47,292
He's here.

1313
02:19:50,492 --> 02:19:52,292
One moment of peace,
can he not give us that?

1314
02:19:52,492 --> 02:19:53,492
Where is he?

1315
02:19:53,692 --> 02:19:57,192
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1316
02:19:57,791 --> 02:19:59,391
Father!

1317
02:20:04,291 --> 02:20:06,691
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1318
02:20:06,891 --> 02:20:10,290
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1319
02:20:11,691 --> 02:20:14,590
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1320
02:20:15,390 --> 02:20:17,690
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1321
02:20:17,890 --> 02:20:19,890
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1322
02:20:20,090 --> 02:20:21,790
Oh, too few.

1323
02:20:22,289 --> 02:20:24,689
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1324
02:20:26,889 --> 02:20:29,888
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1325
02:20:30,089 --> 02:20:32,388
That is not my intent.

1326
02:20:32,589 --> 02:20:36,288
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1327
02:20:39,688 --> 02:20:42,587
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1328
02:20:42,788 --> 02:20:45,488
...I know his uses, and they are few.

1329
02:20:45,687 --> 02:20:49,287
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1330
02:20:50,487 --> 02:20:52,887
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1331
02:20:53,087 --> 02:20:55,887
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1332
02:20:56,086 --> 02:20:59,886
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1333
02:21:02,187 --> 02:21:04,386
The One Ring.

1334
02:21:07,186 --> 02:21:11,885
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1335
02:21:11,985 --> 02:21:15,685
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1336
02:21:15,785 --> 02:21:19,985
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1337
02:21:21,785 --> 02:21:24,384
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1338
02:21:24,584 --> 02:21:28,284
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1339
02:21:28,484 --> 02:21:32,383
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1340
02:21:32,484 --> 02:21:37,883
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1341
02:21:38,083 --> 02:21:43,083
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1342
02:21:43,282 --> 02:21:44,783
He will return.

1343
02:21:44,982 --> 02:21:48,683
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1344
02:21:48,882 --> 02:21:51,382
You must go.

1345
02:21:52,582 --> 02:21:54,682
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1346
02:21:55,482 --> 02:22:00,981
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1347
02:22:01,181 --> 02:22:04,881
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1348
02:22:05,081 --> 02:22:08,081
...send me in his stead.
- You?

1349
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:11,180
Oh, I see.

1350
02:22:11,381 --> 02:22:15,581
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1351
02:22:15,980 --> 02:22:17,979
I think not.

1352
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:20,980
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1353
02:22:21,179 --> 02:22:24,080
The one who will not fail me.

1354
02:22:41,178 --> 02:22:44,277
Remember today, little brother.

1355
02:23:02,676 --> 02:23:04,676
Captain Faramir!

1356
02:23:05,976 --> 02:23:08,076
We found the third one.

1357
02:23:19,674 --> 02:23:21,575
You must come with me. Now.

1358
02:23:32,774 --> 02:23:33,873
Down there.

1359
02:23:48,872 --> 02:23:51,772
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1360
02:24:02,371 --> 02:24:03,871
They wait for my command.

1361
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:10,370
Shall I shoot?

1362
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:14,670
<i>The rock and pool
Is nice and cool</i>

1363
02:24:14,870 --> 02:24:16,670
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1364
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:20,269
<i>Our only wish
To catch a fish</i>

1365
02:24:20,469 --> 02:24:23,170
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1366
02:24:30,169 --> 02:24:31,568
Wait.

1367
02:24:33,068 --> 02:24:35,869
This creature is bound to me.

1368
02:24:36,468 --> 02:24:38,369
And I to him.

1369
02:24:41,667 --> 02:24:42,968
He is our guide.

1370
02:24:47,668 --> 02:24:49,067
Please...

1371
02:24:49,267 --> 02:24:51,167
...let me go down to him.

1372
02:25:02,466 --> 02:25:04,166
Sméagol.

1373
02:25:05,166 --> 02:25:07,366
Master is here.

1374
02:25:08,565 --> 02:25:09,666
Come, Sméagol.

1375
02:25:12,565 --> 02:25:15,165
Trust master. Come.

1376
02:25:18,365 --> 02:25:22,164
We must go now?

1377
02:25:22,565 --> 02:25:25,964
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1378
02:25:26,164 --> 02:25:27,564
Follow me. Come on.

1379
02:25:28,864 --> 02:25:30,264
Come.

1380
02:25:32,863 --> 02:25:33,963
Come, Sméagol.

1381
02:25:34,563 --> 02:25:36,563
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1382
02:25:37,163 --> 02:25:38,663
Come on.

1383
02:25:43,063 --> 02:25:44,762
Don't hurt him!

1384
02:25:44,862 --> 02:25:47,663
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1385
02:25:47,763 --> 02:25:49,062
Master!

1386
02:26:14,661 --> 02:26:16,259
That's enough.

1387
02:26:33,807 --> 02:26:38,607
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1388
02:26:39,807 --> 02:26:42,407
Cruel Men hurts us.

1389
02:26:42,607 --> 02:26:45,607
Master tricksed us.

1390
02:26:45,807 --> 02:26:49,407
Of course he did.

1391
02:26:49,807 --> 02:26:53,507
I told you he was tricksy.

1392
02:26:53,607 --> 02:26:56,707
I told you he was false.

1393
02:26:56,807 --> 02:26:59,507
Master is our friend.

1394
02:26:59,707 --> 02:27:02,107
Our friend.

1395
02:27:02,207 --> 02:27:04,407
Master betrayed us.

1396
02:27:04,607 --> 02:27:07,607
No. Not its business.

1397
02:27:08,607 --> 02:27:11,107
Leave us alone!

1398
02:27:11,307 --> 02:27:13,707
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1399
02:27:13,807 --> 02:27:16,107
They stole it from us!

1400
02:27:16,307 --> 02:27:17,708
No. No.

1401
02:27:18,308 --> 02:27:19,908
What did they steal?

1402
02:27:22,108 --> 02:27:27,408
My precious!

1403
02:27:31,108 --> 02:27:32,708
We have to get out of here.

1404
02:27:33,308 --> 02:27:35,308
You go. Go, now.

1405
02:27:37,908 --> 02:27:39,708
You can do it.

1406
02:27:41,208 --> 02:27:42,608
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1407
02:27:42,808 --> 02:27:44,608
Just this once.

1408
02:27:44,808 --> 02:27:46,508
Put it on.

1409
02:27:47,008 --> 02:27:49,008
Disappear.

1410
02:27:50,108 --> 02:27:51,108
I can't.

1411
02:27:54,308 --> 02:27:56,508
You were right, Sam.

1412
02:27:57,908 --> 02:28:00,408
You tried to tell me but...

1413
02:28:05,109 --> 02:28:07,309
I'm sorry.

1414
02:28:11,809 --> 02:28:14,709
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1415
02:28:16,109 --> 02:28:17,809
If I put it on...

1416
02:28:18,009 --> 02:28:20,309
...he'll find me.

1417
02:28:22,009 --> 02:28:23,909
He'll see.

1418
02:28:25,209 --> 02:28:27,209
Mr. Frodo...

1419
02:28:32,009 --> 02:28:36,309
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1420
02:28:38,509 --> 02:28:41,509
Here in the Wild I have you...

1421
02:28:41,709 --> 02:28:43,609
...two Halflings...

1422
02:28:43,709 --> 02:28:46,910
...and a host of men at my call.

1423
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:53,710
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1424
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:07,210
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1425
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:11,810
...to show his quality.

1426
02:29:32,911 --> 02:29:34,511
No!

1427
02:29:37,711 --> 02:29:39,011
Stop it!

1428
02:29:39,211 --> 02:29:40,211
Leave him alone.

1429
02:29:41,611 --> 02:29:44,111
Don't you understand?

1430
02:29:45,411 --> 02:29:47,311
He's got to destroy it!

1431
02:29:47,411 --> 02:29:50,711
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1432
02:29:50,811 --> 02:29:52,511
To the Mountain of Fire!

1433
02:29:53,611 --> 02:29:56,711
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1434
02:29:56,911 --> 02:29:59,811
Please. It's such a burden.

1435
02:30:02,011 --> 02:30:04,111
Will you not help him?

1436
02:30:05,511 --> 02:30:07,411
Captain?

1437
02:30:08,111 --> 02:30:10,311
Prepare to leave.

1438
02:30:15,212 --> 02:30:17,712
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1439
02:31:30,613 --> 02:31:33,213
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1440
02:31:33,413 --> 02:31:36,513
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1441
02:31:36,713 --> 02:31:40,414
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1442
02:31:40,614 --> 02:31:44,614
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1443
02:31:45,314 --> 02:31:46,814
Bless you, laddie.

1444
02:31:47,414 --> 02:31:49,114
Gimli, where is the king?

1445
02:32:02,914 --> 02:32:04,214
You look terrible.

1446
02:32:46,015 --> 02:32:48,015
A great host, you say?

1447
02:32:48,215 --> 02:32:50,915
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1448
02:32:51,615 --> 02:32:54,515
Ten thousand strong at least.

1449
02:32:56,115 --> 02:32:57,515
Ten thousand?

1450
02:32:58,015 --> 02:33:00,415
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1451
02:33:03,115 --> 02:33:05,315
To destroy the world of Men.

1452
02:33:07,816 --> 02:33:09,816
They will be here by nightfall.

1453
02:33:15,616 --> 02:33:16,916
Let them come!

1454
02:33:18,416 --> 02:33:21,216
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1455
02:33:21,416 --> 02:33:24,516
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1456
02:33:32,716 --> 02:33:35,616
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1457
02:33:35,816 --> 02:33:38,216
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1458
02:33:38,416 --> 02:33:41,116
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1459
02:33:41,316 --> 02:33:43,716
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1460
02:33:44,316 --> 02:33:46,516
These are Uruk-hai.

1461
02:33:46,716 --> 02:33:50,116
Their armor is thick
and their shields broad.

1462
02:33:51,817 --> 02:33:55,417
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1463
02:33:55,617 --> 02:33:59,217
I know how to defend my own keep.

1464
02:34:05,817 --> 02:34:09,217
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1465
02:34:09,417 --> 02:34:14,617
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1466
02:34:14,817 --> 02:34:17,517
Crops can be resown...

1467
02:34:17,717 --> 02:34:20,717
...homes rebuilt.

1468
02:34:21,317 --> 02:34:23,817
Within these walls...

1469
02:34:24,217 --> 02:34:25,717
...we will outlast them.

1470
02:34:25,917 --> 02:34:28,317
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1471
02:34:28,517 --> 02:34:30,017
They come to destroy its people...

1472
02:34:30,117 --> 02:34:32,617
...down to the last child.

1473
02:34:33,517 --> 02:34:35,818
What would you have me do?

1474
02:34:36,018 --> 02:34:37,718
Look at my men.

1475
02:34:37,918 --> 02:34:39,618
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1476
02:34:41,818 --> 02:34:46,218
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1477
02:34:46,418 --> 02:34:49,418
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1478
02:34:53,018 --> 02:34:54,918
Send out riders, my lord.

1479
02:34:55,218 --> 02:34:58,118
You must call for aid.

1480
02:35:01,418 --> 02:35:03,718
And who will come?

1481
02:35:04,118 --> 02:35:05,718
Elves?

1482
02:35:05,918 --> 02:35:07,918
Dwarves?

1483
02:35:08,718 --> 02:35:11,618
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1484
02:35:12,418 --> 02:35:14,718
The old alliances are dead.

1485
02:35:15,118 --> 02:35:17,918
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1486
02:35:18,119 --> 02:35:20,319
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1487
02:35:21,219 --> 02:35:24,519
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1488
02:35:24,619 --> 02:35:26,619
Where was Gon...?

1489
02:35:29,219 --> 02:35:31,119
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1490
02:35:32,719 --> 02:35:35,219
...we are alone.

1491
02:35:42,119 --> 02:35:43,819
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1492
02:35:44,019 --> 02:35:45,319
We need more time
to lay provisions...

1493
02:35:45,419 --> 02:35:48,919
There is no time. War is upon us.

1494
02:35:49,219 --> 02:35:50,919
Secure the gate.

1495
02:35:56,119 --> 02:35:58,219
We Ents have not troubled...

1496
02:35:58,419 --> 02:36:01,820
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1497
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:05,520
...for a very long time.

1498
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:11,620
But now, something
is about to happen...

1499
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:14,120
...that has not happened...

1500
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:16,820
...for an age.

1501
02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:20,220
Entmoot.

1502
02:36:20,720 --> 02:36:21,620
What's that?

1503
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:24,920
'Tis a gathering.

1504
02:36:26,120 --> 02:36:28,720
A gathering of what?

1505
02:36:46,621 --> 02:36:49,021
Beech. Oak.

1506
02:36:49,221 --> 02:36:51,121
Chestnut. Ash.

1507
02:36:51,321 --> 02:36:53,321
Good. Good. Good.

1508
02:36:53,521 --> 02:36:55,821
Many have come.

1509
02:37:03,421 --> 02:37:06,121
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1510
02:37:06,321 --> 02:37:08,921
...will go to war.

1511
02:37:17,821 --> 02:37:20,921
Move back! Move to the caves!

1512
02:37:23,421 --> 02:37:25,421
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1513
02:37:25,921 --> 02:37:28,221
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1514
02:37:28,321 --> 02:37:30,622
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1515
02:37:30,722 --> 02:37:33,922
Aragorn, you must rest.

1516
02:37:34,022 --> 02:37:36,422
You're no use to us half alive.

1517
02:37:36,922 --> 02:37:38,122
Aragorn!

1518
02:37:41,522 --> 02:37:44,522
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1519
02:37:44,722 --> 02:37:46,422
That is an honorable charge.

1520
02:37:46,622 --> 02:37:49,422
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1521
02:37:49,622 --> 02:37:51,322
What renown is there in that?

1522
02:37:51,522 --> 02:37:55,222
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1523
02:37:55,522 --> 02:37:58,322
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1524
02:37:58,422 --> 02:38:03,422
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1525
02:38:03,722 --> 02:38:06,522
You do not command
the others to stay!

1526
02:38:06,722 --> 02:38:10,522
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1527
02:38:11,622 --> 02:38:13,823
Because they love you.

1528
02:38:21,023 --> 02:38:22,523
I'm sorry.

1529
02:39:28,424 --> 02:39:31,624
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1530
02:39:32,724 --> 02:39:34,524
These are no soldiers.

1531
02:39:36,824 --> 02:39:40,224
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1532
02:39:44,225 --> 02:39:47,125
Look at them. They're frightened.

1533
02:39:47,325 --> 02:39:48,725
I can see it in their eyes.

1534
02:40:09,725 --> 02:40:11,925
Then I shall die as one of them!

1535
02:40:18,425 --> 02:40:20,225
Let him go, lad.

1536
02:40:20,825 --> 02:40:22,725
Let him be.

1537
02:40:24,226 --> 02:40:29,726
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armory.

1538
02:40:33,926 --> 02:40:35,826
My lord?

1539
02:40:37,926 --> 02:40:40,426
Who am I, Gamling?

1540
02:40:43,826 --> 02:40:47,726
You are our king, sire.

1541
02:40:50,726 --> 02:40:54,026
And do you trust your king?

1542
02:40:55,526 --> 02:40:58,726
Your men, my lord...

1543
02:40:58,926 --> 02:41:01,726
...will follow you to whatever end.

1544
02:41:08,627 --> 02:41:10,527
To whatever end.

1545
02:41:20,327 --> 02:41:23,927
Where is the horse and the rider?

1546
02:41:24,127 --> 02:41:27,127
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1547
02:41:28,627 --> 02:41:33,027
<i>They have passed like rain
on the mountains.</i>

1548
02:41:34,027 --> 02:41:37,227
<i>Like wind in the meadow.</i>

1549
02:41:40,927 --> 02:41:44,727
The days have gone down in the West...

1550
02:41:45,427 --> 02:41:48,027
<i>...behind the hills...</i>

1551
02:41:50,027 --> 02:41:51,628
<i>...into Shadow.</i>

1552
02:42:00,028 --> 02:42:03,528
How did it come to this?

1553
02:42:24,828 --> 02:42:26,728
It's been going for hours.

1554
02:42:27,828 --> 02:42:30,228
They must have decided something
by now.

1555
02:42:30,328 --> 02:42:34,428
Decided? No.

1556
02:42:34,628 --> 02:42:39,729
We only just finished saying...

1557
02:42:40,929 --> 02:42:42,829
...good morning.

1558
02:42:44,229 --> 02:42:47,329
But it's nighttime already.

1559
02:42:47,529 --> 02:42:49,329
You can't take forever.

1560
02:42:50,329 --> 02:42:52,429
Don't be hasty.

1561
02:42:52,929 --> 02:42:55,329
We're running out of time!

1562
02:42:58,329 --> 02:43:01,229
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1563
02:43:18,830 --> 02:43:20,130
Give me your sword.

1564
02:43:29,630 --> 02:43:30,730
What is your name?

1565
02:43:31,330 --> 02:43:33,730
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1566
02:43:35,830 --> 02:43:38,430
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1567
02:43:40,430 --> 02:43:42,430
They say that it is hopeless.

1568
02:44:00,230 --> 02:44:01,830
This is a good sword.

1569
02:44:03,931 --> 02:44:06,231
Haleth, son of Háma...

1570
02:44:10,631 --> 02:44:12,731
...there is always hope.

1571
02:44:35,731 --> 02:44:39,031
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1572
02:44:39,231 --> 02:44:40,731
Forgive me.

1573
02:44:40,931 --> 02:44:42,431
I was wrong to despair.

1574
02:44:51,632 --> 02:44:54,432
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1575
02:44:57,832 --> 02:44:59,932
It's a little tight across the chest.

1576
02:45:06,132 --> 02:45:08,132
That is no Orc horn.

1577
02:45:13,732 --> 02:45:15,632
Send for the king.

1578
02:45:15,732 --> 02:45:19,332
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1579
02:45:51,033 --> 02:45:52,633
How is this possible?

1580
02:45:53,633 --> 02:45:57,333
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1581
02:45:57,433 --> 02:46:00,733
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1582
02:46:01,433 --> 02:46:05,633
Long ago we fought and died together.

1583
02:46:07,933 --> 02:46:10,833
We come to honor that allegiance.

1584
02:46:19,334 --> 02:46:21,234
You are most welcome.

1585
02:46:26,634 --> 02:46:30,534
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1586
02:47:04,235 --> 02:47:07,535
You could have picked a better spot.

1587
02:47:12,435 --> 02:47:16,535
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1588
02:47:22,735 --> 02:47:24,535
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1589
02:47:25,235 --> 02:47:27,635
Let's hope they last the night.

1590
02:49:09,138 --> 02:49:11,938
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1591
02:49:13,138 --> 02:49:14,938
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1592
02:50:18,139 --> 02:50:19,939
So it begins.

1593
02:50:46,840 --> 02:50:48,140
Did they hit anything?

1594
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:50,840
Give them a volley.

1595
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:53,140
- Fire!
- Fire!

1596
02:51:08,840 --> 02:51:10,540
Send them to me! Come on!

1597
02:51:31,241 --> 02:51:32,341
Good!

1598
02:51:39,141 --> 02:51:42,141
Swords! Swords!

1599
02:52:20,242 --> 02:52:22,342
Legolas! Two already!

1600
02:52:22,542 --> 02:52:24,642
I'm on 17!

1601
02:52:24,842 --> 02:52:27,442
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1602
02:52:34,142 --> 02:52:35,942
Nineteen!

1603
02:53:01,943 --> 02:53:03,343
Merry.

1604
02:53:07,743 --> 02:53:11,543
We have just agreed.

1605
02:53:21,543 --> 02:53:23,043
Yes?

1606
02:53:24,543 --> 02:53:28,743
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1607
02:53:29,843 --> 02:53:33,044
...and we have agreed...

1608
02:53:33,544 --> 02:53:37,544
...you are not Orcs.

1609
02:53:39,244 --> 02:53:41,444
Well, that's good news.

1610
02:53:41,544 --> 02:53:45,744
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1611
02:53:46,344 --> 02:53:50,144
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1612
02:53:50,344 --> 02:53:51,844
Hasty?

1613
02:53:52,644 --> 02:53:54,544
Our friends are out there.

1614
02:53:54,744 --> 02:53:58,844
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1615
02:53:59,244 --> 02:54:01,444
War? Yes.

1616
02:54:01,644 --> 02:54:03,544
It affects us all.

1617
02:54:03,744 --> 02:54:06,744
Tree, root and twig.

1618
02:54:07,644 --> 02:54:11,644
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1619
02:54:11,844 --> 02:54:13,744
...it takes a long time...

1620
02:54:13,944 --> 02:54:18,845
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1621
02:54:19,045 --> 02:54:23,245
...and we never say anything...

1622
02:54:23,445 --> 02:54:27,345
...unless it is worth taking...

1623
02:54:27,545 --> 02:54:31,445
...a long time to say.

1624
02:54:32,245 --> 02:54:35,545
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1625
02:54:35,745 --> 02:54:36,845
Nineteen!

1626
02:54:37,445 --> 02:54:39,245
Twenty!

1627
02:54:39,445 --> 02:54:41,145
Twenty-one!

1628
02:54:51,145 --> 02:54:53,145
Causeway!

1629
02:55:00,946 --> 02:55:03,346
Is this it?

1630
02:55:03,546 --> 02:55:06,446
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1631
02:56:32,448 --> 02:56:33,848
Brace the gate!

1632
02:56:52,148 --> 02:56:54,448
Hold them! Stand firm!

1633
02:57:02,348 --> 02:57:03,648
Aragorn!

1634
02:57:08,248 --> 02:57:09,449
Gimli!

1635
02:57:58,250 --> 02:58:02,150
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1636
02:58:02,950 --> 02:58:06,950
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1637
02:58:07,750 --> 02:58:09,850
How can that be your decision?!

1638
02:58:10,550 --> 02:58:14,150
This is not our war.

1639
02:58:14,450 --> 02:58:16,650
But you're part of this world!

1640
02:58:20,850 --> 02:58:22,650
Aren't you?!

1641
02:58:26,750 --> 02:58:29,150
You must help. Please.

1642
02:58:30,350 --> 02:58:33,150
You must do something.

1643
02:58:33,450 --> 02:58:37,751
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1644
02:58:38,951 --> 02:58:42,651
But your part in this tale is over.

1645
02:58:42,851 --> 02:58:45,051
Go back to your home.

1646
02:58:55,051 --> 02:58:57,351
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1647
02:58:57,551 --> 02:58:59,351
We don't belong here, Merry.

1648
02:58:59,551 --> 02:59:01,851
It's too big for us.

1649
02:59:02,051 --> 02:59:04,651
What can we do in the end?

1650
02:59:06,951 --> 02:59:09,651
We've got the Shire.

1651
02:59:10,151 --> 02:59:12,651
Maybe we should go home.

1652
02:59:14,551 --> 02:59:17,751
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1653
02:59:17,951 --> 02:59:22,852
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1654
02:59:22,952 --> 02:59:24,552
And...

1655
02:59:26,452 --> 02:59:29,452
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1656
02:59:32,952 --> 02:59:35,952
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1657
02:59:55,452 --> 02:59:56,652
Aragorn!

1658
02:59:56,852 --> 02:59:59,152
Fall back to the Keep!

1659
02:59:59,352 --> 03:00:02,452
Get your men out of there!

1660
03:00:12,153 --> 03:00:13,753
Haldir!

1661
03:00:17,953 --> 03:00:21,153
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1662
03:00:40,353 --> 03:00:41,553
Haldir!

1663
03:01:24,354 --> 03:01:25,854
Brace the gate!

1664
03:01:28,054 --> 03:01:29,354
Hold them!

1665
03:01:31,155 --> 03:01:34,455
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1666
03:02:02,655 --> 03:02:04,555
Make way!

1667
03:02:07,455 --> 03:02:09,255
We cannot hold much longer!

1668
03:02:15,256 --> 03:02:18,756
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1669
03:02:18,956 --> 03:02:21,556
As long as you can give me.

1670
03:02:21,756 --> 03:02:23,356
Gimli!

1671
03:02:24,856 --> 03:02:26,256
Timbers!

1672
03:02:26,356 --> 03:02:28,356
Brace the gate!

1673
03:02:43,056 --> 03:02:44,756
Come on. We can take them.

1674
03:02:45,656 --> 03:02:47,256
It's a long way.

1675
03:02:52,456 --> 03:02:54,256
Toss me.

1676
03:02:55,456 --> 03:02:57,256
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1677
03:02:57,456 --> 03:02:58,957
You'll have to toss me!

1678
03:03:04,657 --> 03:03:05,857
Don't tell the Elf.

1679
03:03:06,457 --> 03:03:08,157
Not a word.

1680
03:03:23,457 --> 03:03:24,857
Shore up the door!

1681
03:03:25,057 --> 03:03:27,157
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1682
03:03:27,357 --> 03:03:28,357
Watch our backs!

1683
03:03:32,457 --> 03:03:34,757
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1684
03:04:24,658 --> 03:04:26,059
Hold fast the gate!

1685
03:04:30,259 --> 03:04:33,259
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1686
03:04:37,959 --> 03:04:39,559
Aragorn!

1687
03:05:13,060 --> 03:05:15,460
Pull everybody back.

1688
03:05:15,860 --> 03:05:17,660
Pull them back.

1689
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:19,660
Fall back!

1690
03:05:19,860 --> 03:05:22,360
Fall back!

1691
03:05:23,460 --> 03:05:25,160
They have broken through!

1692
03:05:25,360 --> 03:05:27,660
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1693
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:30,060
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1694
03:05:30,160 --> 03:05:32,760
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1695
03:05:32,960 --> 03:05:35,160
Into the Keep!

1696
03:05:46,660 --> 03:05:51,560
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1697
03:05:51,760 --> 03:05:56,461
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1698
03:06:02,261 --> 03:06:03,461
Wait! Stop!

1699
03:06:04,361 --> 03:06:05,861
Stop!

1700
03:06:09,061 --> 03:06:10,761
Turn around.

1701
03:06:11,661 --> 03:06:14,361
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1702
03:06:14,561 --> 03:06:19,561
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1703
03:06:19,861 --> 03:06:22,561
Yes. Exactly.

1704
03:06:22,761 --> 03:06:25,961
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1705
03:06:26,161 --> 03:06:28,861
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1706
03:06:28,961 --> 03:06:30,961
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1707
03:06:33,561 --> 03:06:36,661
That doesn't make sense to me.

1708
03:06:36,761 --> 03:06:37,962
But then...

1709
03:06:38,162 --> 03:06:40,862
...you are very small.

1710
03:06:41,362 --> 03:06:43,062
Perhaps you're right.

1711
03:06:45,762 --> 03:06:47,262
South it is, then.

1712
03:06:48,762 --> 03:06:52,162
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1713
03:06:54,162 --> 03:06:56,962
I always like going south.

1714
03:06:57,062 --> 03:07:01,362
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1715
03:07:01,962 --> 03:07:04,462
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1716
03:07:04,662 --> 03:07:06,562
No, we won't.

1717
03:07:07,262 --> 03:07:09,562
Not this time.

1718
03:07:16,262 --> 03:07:17,262
Look!

1719
03:07:18,862 --> 03:07:21,363
Osgiliath burns!

1720
03:07:21,563 --> 03:07:22,963
Mordor has come.

1721
03:07:24,063 --> 03:07:26,463
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1722
03:07:27,863 --> 03:07:30,063
It has only the power to destroy.

1723
03:07:30,863 --> 03:07:32,263
Please...

1724
03:07:32,463 --> 03:07:34,063
...let me go.

1725
03:07:35,163 --> 03:07:36,763
Hurry.

1726
03:07:40,163 --> 03:07:41,563
Faramir!

1727
03:07:41,763 --> 03:07:44,263
You must let me go!

1728
03:07:44,663 --> 03:07:48,163
And those little family of field mice...

1729
03:07:48,363 --> 03:07:51,163
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1730
03:07:51,863 --> 03:07:55,163
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1731
03:08:06,364 --> 03:08:09,364
Many of these trees were my friends.

1732
03:08:10,064 --> 03:08:14,664
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1733
03:08:15,864 --> 03:08:17,064
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1734
03:08:17,164 --> 03:08:19,964
They had voices of their own.

1735
03:08:22,264 --> 03:08:24,764
Saruman.

1736
03:08:25,164 --> 03:08:28,164
A wizard should know better!

1737
03:08:42,464 --> 03:08:46,064
There is no curse in Elvish...

1738
03:08:46,264 --> 03:08:48,965
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1739
03:08:49,065 --> 03:08:51,465
...for this treachery.

1740
03:08:52,865 --> 03:08:55,665
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1741
03:09:00,465 --> 03:09:01,565
Where are they going?

1742
03:09:02,165 --> 03:09:05,365
They have business with the Orcs.

1743
03:09:05,865 --> 03:09:10,165
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1744
03:09:10,265 --> 03:09:12,965
...with rock and stone.

1745
03:09:36,866 --> 03:09:37,966
Yes.

1746
03:09:39,066 --> 03:09:40,466
Come, my friends.

1747
03:09:41,866 --> 03:09:46,066
The Ents are going to war.

1748
03:09:46,166 --> 03:09:47,966
It is likely...

1749
03:09:48,166 --> 03:09:51,666
...that we go to our doom.

1750
03:09:53,066 --> 03:09:55,566
Last march...

1751
03:09:56,066 --> 03:09:58,066
...of the Ents.

1752
03:10:46,267 --> 03:10:49,967
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1753
03:10:50,167 --> 03:10:52,167
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1754
03:10:54,967 --> 03:10:56,467
Mr. Frodo?

1755
03:10:56,767 --> 03:11:00,868
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1756
03:11:00,968 --> 03:11:03,468
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1757
03:11:17,868 --> 03:11:19,268
Take them to my father.

1758
03:11:20,868 --> 03:11:23,768
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1759
03:11:26,268 --> 03:11:29,268
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1760
03:11:30,368 --> 03:11:33,068
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1761
03:11:33,668 --> 03:11:36,468
You want to know
why your brother died?

1762
03:11:36,968 --> 03:11:40,668
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1763
03:11:40,868 --> 03:11:42,769
He tried to kill him!

1764
03:11:42,969 --> 03:11:45,269
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1765
03:11:46,069 --> 03:11:47,969
Watch out!

1766
03:11:58,869 --> 03:11:59,969
Mr. Frodo?

1767
03:12:02,669 --> 03:12:04,469
They're here.

1768
03:12:07,569 --> 03:12:10,069
They've come.

1769
03:12:12,669 --> 03:12:14,569
Nazgûl!

1770
03:12:36,570 --> 03:12:38,770
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1771
03:12:40,570 --> 03:12:42,770
Take cover!

1772
03:13:00,170 --> 03:13:01,670
The fortress is taken.

1773
03:13:02,470 --> 03:13:03,670
It is over.

1774
03:13:03,870 --> 03:13:07,770
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1775
03:13:07,970 --> 03:13:10,871
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1776
03:13:13,671 --> 03:13:15,071
They're breaking in!

1777
03:13:17,671 --> 03:13:20,171
They're past the door!

1778
03:13:23,571 --> 03:13:27,671
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1779
03:13:30,271 --> 03:13:32,271
Is there no other way?

1780
03:13:33,771 --> 03:13:36,871
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1781
03:13:37,571 --> 03:13:39,771
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1782
03:13:44,571 --> 03:13:46,971
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1783
03:13:47,171 --> 03:13:50,071
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1784
03:13:52,271 --> 03:13:55,672
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1785
03:14:00,272 --> 03:14:01,772
Ride out with me.

1786
03:14:05,872 --> 03:14:07,472
Ride out and meet them.

1787
03:14:08,272 --> 03:14:10,472
For death and glory.

1788
03:14:10,572 --> 03:14:11,972
For Rohan.

1789
03:14:13,472 --> 03:14:14,972
For your people.

1790
03:14:15,672 --> 03:14:17,672
The sun is rising.

1791
03:14:22,172 --> 03:14:25,172
<i>Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.</i>

1792
03:14:25,272 --> 03:14:26,672
<i>At dawn...</i>

1793
03:14:26,872 --> 03:14:28,572
<i>...look to the east.</i>

1794
03:14:32,772 --> 03:14:34,372
Yes.

1795
03:14:36,872 --> 03:14:38,473
Yes.

1796
03:14:39,873 --> 03:14:42,273
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1797
03:14:42,473 --> 03:14:45,273
...shall sound in the Deep...

1798
03:14:45,673 --> 03:14:47,673
...one last time.

1799
03:14:47,873 --> 03:14:49,373
Yes!

1800
03:14:52,373 --> 03:14:56,173
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1801
03:15:03,973 --> 03:15:05,273
Fell deeds, awake.

1802
03:15:06,473 --> 03:15:07,573
Now for wrath...

1803
03:15:07,773 --> 03:15:11,173
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1804
03:15:18,273 --> 03:15:20,473
Forth Eorlingas!

1805
03:16:08,275 --> 03:16:09,475
Gandalf.

1806
03:16:16,775 --> 03:16:20,475
Théoden King stands alone.

1807
03:16:21,075 --> 03:16:23,275
Not alone.

1808
03:16:23,675 --> 03:16:24,775
Rohirrim!

1809
03:16:30,675 --> 03:16:31,875
Éomer.

1810
03:16:31,975 --> 03:16:34,575
To the king!

1811
03:17:52,177 --> 03:17:53,977
Yes!

1812
03:18:03,077 --> 03:18:06,577
A hit. A fine hit.

1813
03:18:31,078 --> 03:18:33,578
Break the dam!

1814
03:18:33,678 --> 03:18:37,178
Release the river!

1815
03:19:04,479 --> 03:19:07,279
Pippin! Hold on!

1816
03:19:12,479 --> 03:19:15,479
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1817
03:19:56,780 --> 03:19:58,780
What are you doing?

1818
03:20:07,380 --> 03:20:08,880
Where are you going?

1819
03:21:07,081 --> 03:21:08,381
It's me.

1820
03:21:10,982 --> 03:21:13,182
It's your Sam.

1821
03:21:17,482 --> 03:21:20,082
Don't you know your Sam?

1822
03:21:37,782 --> 03:21:41,182
I can't do this, Sam.

1823
03:21:42,082 --> 03:21:44,082
I know.

1824
03:21:45,082 --> 03:21:47,482
It's all wrong.

1825
03:21:48,182 --> 03:21:50,182
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1826
03:21:57,683 --> 03:21:59,783
But we are.

1827
03:22:06,183 --> 03:22:09,183
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1828
03:22:09,383 --> 03:22:11,783
The ones that really mattered.

1829
03:22:12,783 --> 03:22:15,783
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1830
03:22:15,983 --> 03:22:18,983
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1831
03:22:19,083 --> 03:22:22,083
...because how could the end be happy?

1832
03:22:24,683 --> 03:22:26,783
<i>How could the world go back
to the way it was...</i>

1833
03:22:26,983 --> 03:22:30,483
<i>...when so much bad had happened?</i>

1834
03:22:31,283 --> 03:22:33,183
Victory!

1835
03:22:33,383 --> 03:22:34,883
We have victory!

1836
03:22:35,083 --> 03:22:38,984
<i>But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...</i>

1837
03:22:39,184 --> 03:22:40,484
<i>...this shadow.</i>

1838
03:22:40,684 --> 03:22:43,084
<i>Even darkness must pass.</i>

1839
03:22:43,284 --> 03:22:45,984
<i>A new day will come.</i>

1840
03:22:46,184 --> 03:22:50,084
<i>And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.</i>

1841
03:22:51,984 --> 03:22:54,384
<i>Those were the stories
that stayed with you...</i>

1842
03:22:54,584 --> 03:22:56,284
<i>...that meant something.</i>

1843
03:22:56,484 --> 03:22:59,084
<i>Even if you were too small
to understand why.</i>

1844
03:23:00,484 --> 03:23:04,284
<i>But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.</i>

1845
03:23:04,484 --> 03:23:06,084
<i>I know now.</i>

1846
03:23:06,884 --> 03:23:09,084
Folk in those stories...

1847
03:23:09,284 --> 03:23:13,384
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1848
03:23:13,584 --> 03:23:15,784
They kept going...

1849
03:23:16,484 --> 03:23:19,684
...because they were holding
on to something.

1850
03:23:21,384 --> 03:23:23,685
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1851
03:23:35,585 --> 03:23:39,485
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1852
03:23:39,785 --> 03:23:42,385
And it's worth fighting for.

1853
03:24:09,286 --> 03:24:13,586
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1854
03:24:14,386 --> 03:24:18,286
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1855
03:24:18,486 --> 03:24:20,686
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1856
03:24:25,086 --> 03:24:26,486
Then it is forfeit.

1857
03:24:29,186 --> 03:24:30,886
Release them.

1858
03:24:42,986 --> 03:24:45,086
Stay out of the forest!

1859
03:24:45,286 --> 03:24:47,086
Keep away from the trees!

1860
03:25:37,888 --> 03:25:39,688
Final count...

1861
03:25:39,788 --> 03:25:42,688
...42.
- Forty-two?

1862
03:25:44,188 --> 03:25:48,988
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1863
03:25:49,788 --> 03:25:53,488
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1864
03:25:57,588 --> 03:26:00,888
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

1865
03:26:01,588 --> 03:26:04,088
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1866
03:26:04,288 --> 03:26:08,988
...because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1867
03:26:11,188 --> 03:26:15,888
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1868
03:26:16,188 --> 03:26:19,689
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1869
03:26:19,889 --> 03:26:22,889
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1870
03:26:23,089 --> 03:26:25,889
I hear the staff are very good.

1871
03:26:31,589 --> 03:26:33,889
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1872
03:26:34,089 --> 03:26:38,389
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1873
03:26:38,489 --> 03:26:39,789
I'm starving.

1874
03:26:39,989 --> 03:26:42,989
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1875
03:26:43,189 --> 03:26:46,289
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1876
03:27:10,290 --> 03:27:12,690
Saruman's storeroom!

1877
03:27:14,990 --> 03:27:17,690
I don't believe it.

1878
03:27:17,890 --> 03:27:19,990
It can't be.

1879
03:27:20,590 --> 03:27:23,490
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1880
03:27:24,790 --> 03:27:27,090
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1881
03:27:27,490 --> 03:27:30,490
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1882
03:27:30,690 --> 03:27:31,790
Wait.

1883
03:27:32,590 --> 03:27:33,790
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1884
03:27:33,990 --> 03:27:35,490
Share it?

1885
03:27:37,290 --> 03:27:39,690
No. No.

1886
03:27:41,190 --> 03:27:42,590
Dead plant and all that.

1887
03:27:42,990 --> 03:27:45,191
Don't think he'd understand.

1888
03:27:46,491 --> 03:27:48,591
Could be a distant relative.

1889
03:27:49,391 --> 03:27:51,891
I get it.

1890
03:27:52,091 --> 03:27:54,891
Don't be hasty.

1891
03:27:56,091 --> 03:27:57,791
Exactly.

1892
03:27:58,891 --> 03:28:01,191
Bar-hrum.

1893
03:28:26,791 --> 03:28:28,092
This is the old sewer.

1894
03:28:28,292 --> 03:28:31,292
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1895
03:28:31,492 --> 03:28:33,192
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1896
03:28:34,292 --> 03:28:36,792
Captain Faramir...

1897
03:28:37,392 --> 03:28:39,292
...you have shown your quality, sir.

1898
03:28:41,792 --> 03:28:43,092
The very highest.

1899
03:28:43,592 --> 03:28:46,192
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

1900
03:28:46,392 --> 03:28:49,292
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

1901
03:28:50,492 --> 03:28:52,492
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1902
03:28:53,092 --> 03:28:54,592
Gollum says there's a path...

1903
03:28:54,792 --> 03:28:58,792
...near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1904
03:28:59,192 --> 03:29:00,992
Cirith Ungol?

1905
03:29:04,492 --> 03:29:07,092
- Is that its name?
- No.

1906
03:29:07,292 --> 03:29:08,892
No!

1907
03:29:09,792 --> 03:29:12,793
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1908
03:29:13,093 --> 03:29:16,693
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1909
03:29:17,593 --> 03:29:20,093
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1910
03:29:20,393 --> 03:29:26,693
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1911
03:29:28,193 --> 03:29:29,993
I must.

1912
03:29:33,493 --> 03:29:37,093
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1913
03:29:37,293 --> 03:29:39,293
Thank you.

1914
03:29:51,093 --> 03:29:55,294
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1915
03:30:07,694 --> 03:30:09,294
Come on, keep up.

1916
03:30:12,794 --> 03:30:15,594
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1917
03:30:16,194 --> 03:30:17,994
You know that, don't you?

1918
03:30:18,794 --> 03:30:20,394
He was trying to save you, see?

1919
03:30:20,894 --> 03:30:22,394
Save me?

1920
03:30:22,794 --> 03:30:24,894
So there's no hard feelings.

1921
03:30:25,094 --> 03:30:30,194
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1922
03:30:30,294 --> 03:30:32,994
Gollum, Gollum.

1923
03:30:33,994 --> 03:30:35,794
Yes, master.

1924
03:30:36,894 --> 03:30:39,695
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

1925
03:30:39,895 --> 03:30:42,195
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1926
03:30:47,695 --> 03:30:52,895
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1927
03:30:59,995 --> 03:31:02,995
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1928
03:31:03,695 --> 03:31:07,195
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1929
03:31:12,395 --> 03:31:15,895
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1930
03:31:16,795 --> 03:31:19,995
<i>...somewhere in the wilderness.</i>

1931
03:31:23,396 --> 03:31:26,796
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1932
03:31:26,896 --> 03:31:28,296
What?

1933
03:31:28,496 --> 03:31:32,396
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1934
03:31:32,496 --> 03:31:35,796
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1935
03:31:35,996 --> 03:31:38,896
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1936
03:31:39,096 --> 03:31:40,696
"Yes, my boy.

1937
03:31:40,896 --> 03:31:44,696
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1938
03:31:44,896 --> 03:31:47,396
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1939
03:31:47,596 --> 03:31:49,496
"Samwise the Brave."

1940
03:31:49,696 --> 03:31:52,396
I want to hear more about Sam.

1941
03:31:56,696 --> 03:31:59,696
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1942
03:32:01,096 --> 03:32:05,096
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1943
03:32:06,197 --> 03:32:07,597
So was I.

1944
03:32:16,497 --> 03:32:19,097
"Samwise the Brave."

1945
03:32:23,497 --> 03:32:24,797
Sméagol?

1946
03:32:24,997 --> 03:32:27,897
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1947
03:32:27,997 --> 03:32:29,997
Master.

1948
03:32:30,097 --> 03:32:32,997
Master looks after us.

1949
03:32:33,797 --> 03:32:36,597
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1950
03:32:36,797 --> 03:32:39,197
Master broke his promise.

1951
03:32:39,397 --> 03:32:41,597
Don't ask Sméagol.

1952
03:32:41,697 --> 03:32:44,897
Poor, poor Sméagol.

1953
03:32:45,097 --> 03:32:47,897
Master betrayed us.

1954
03:32:48,097 --> 03:32:51,198
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1955
03:32:51,398 --> 03:32:55,298
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1956
03:32:55,498 --> 03:32:58,198
Kill him! Kill him!

1957
03:32:58,398 --> 03:32:59,898
Kill them both!

1958
03:33:00,098 --> 03:33:03,698
And then we take the precious...

1959
03:33:03,898 --> 03:33:07,398
...and we be the master!

1960
03:33:08,098 --> 03:33:10,698
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1961
03:33:10,898 --> 03:33:13,598
Eyes always watching.

1962
03:33:13,698 --> 03:33:17,298
Then we stabs them out.

1963
03:33:17,498 --> 03:33:21,998
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1964
03:33:22,198 --> 03:33:25,598
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1965
03:33:25,798 --> 03:33:28,498
Kill them both.

1966
03:33:28,698 --> 03:33:31,098
Yes. No! No!

1967
03:33:31,298 --> 03:33:34,999
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1968
03:33:35,699 --> 03:33:38,299
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1969
03:33:38,499 --> 03:33:41,099
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

1970
03:33:41,199 --> 03:33:46,599
We could let her do it.

1971
03:33:47,599 --> 03:33:51,699
Yes. She could do it.

1972
03:33:51,899 --> 03:33:56,499
Yes, precious, she could.

1973
03:33:56,699 --> 03:34:02,699
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1974
03:34:03,699 --> 03:34:06,499
Once they're dead.

1975
03:34:10,899 --> 03:34:14,599
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1976
03:34:14,799 --> 03:34:16,799
Sméagol will show you the way.

1977
03:34:17,000 --> 03:34:19,200
Follow me.
