1
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,323
- Good morning, Bastian.
- Morning, Dad.

2
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,595
I had another dream, Dad.

3
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,680
About Mom.

4
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,311
I understand, son.

5
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,899
But we have to get on with things.

6
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,539
We each have responsibilities.

7
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,501
We can't let Mom's death...

8
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,464
...be an excuse for not
getting the job done, right?

9
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,549
Yeah.

10
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,318
I think it's time we had a talk.

11
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,200
I got a call from
your math teacher yesterday.

12
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:11,166
She says that you were drawing
horses in your math book.

13
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,337
- Unicorns. They were unicorns.
- What?

14
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,674
Nothing.

15
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:23,220
She also says you haven't been
doing your homework on time.

16
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:30,310
I'm disappointed you didn't
try out for the swim team.

17
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,315
As to those riding lessons
you wanted...

18
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:40,112
...you say you love horses but
you're afraid to get on a real one.

19
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:46,618
You're old enough to get your head
down out of the clouds...

20
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,955
...and keep both feet
on the ground, right?

21
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,333
Okay.

22
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,971
Stop daydreaming.
Start facing your problems. Okay?

23
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,890
- Okay.
- Okay.

24
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,980
There, I think we've had a nice talk.

25
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,024
We should have more.

26
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,819
Have a good day.
Don't be late for school again.

27
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,697
But yesterday I wasn't.

28
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,621
Hey, it's the weirdo.

29
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,792
Weirdo, you got any cash for us today?

30
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,466
Let's get him!

31
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,930
You're dead, weirdo!

32
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,812
- You can't get away, jerk.
- You're dead, chicken!

33
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,106
We're gonna get you!

34
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,569
- Where's your money?
- I don't have any!

35
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,822
No money? Mama's boy is holding out.

36
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,785
If you ain't got money,
you go in the garbage.

37
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,625
Yeah, all right!
Way to go!

38
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,629
Maybe the chicken can lay
an egg in there.

39
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,597
Who said you could get
out of the garbage?

40
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,226
- Get back in there.
- No, not again.

41
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,938
- Not again!
- Where are you going, wimp?

42
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,990
He went that way.
Which way?

43
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,541
Get out of here! I don't like kids.

44
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,684
Are you still here?
Didn't you hear me?

45
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,311
- You're hiding, aren't you?
- No...

46
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,106
The arcade is down the street.

47
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:25,610
Here, we just sell small
rectangular objects called books.

48
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,574
They require effort and make no beeps.
On your way, please.

49
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,244
I know books.
I have 186 of them at home.

50
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,497
- Comic books.
- I have Treasure Island...

51
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,792
...The Last of the Mohicans,
Lord of the Rings...

52
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,296
...20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,
Tarzan...

53
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,510
Who are you running away from?

54
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,477
- Just some kids from school.
- Why?

55
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,483
- They threw me in the garbage.
- Why not punch them in the nose?

56
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,862
I don't know.

57
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,411
What's that book about?

58
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,791
Oh, this is something special.

59
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,716
Well, what is it?

60
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,095
Look...

61
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,641
...your books are safe.

62
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,060
While you're reading...

63
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,731
...you get to become Tarzan
or Robinson Crusoe.

64
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,400
That's what I like about them.

65
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,571
But afterwards you get to be
a little boy again.

66
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,992
- Well, what do you mean?
- Listen.

67
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,163
Have you ever been...

68
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:05,418
...Captain Nemo trapped
inside your submarine...

69
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,130
...while the giant squid
is attacking you?

70
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,844
Weren't you afraid
you couldn't escape?

71
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:19,766
- But it's only a story.
- That's what I'm talking about.

72
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,728
The ones you read are safe.

73
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,733
And that one isn't?

74
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:35,198
- Don't worry about it.
- But you just said it was...

75
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,833
Forget about it.

76
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,876
This book is not for you.

77
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,806
Koreander's.

78
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,560
What can I do for you?

79
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,023
I don't have it but I could find it.

80
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,404
Well, they run maybe 300, 375...

81
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,906
It'd take me a few weeks.

82
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,700
Goodbye.

83
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,046
Math test. Oh, no!

84
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,779
"It was midnight
in the Howling Forest.

85
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,117
The wind whistled through
the tops of the ancient trees.

86
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,703
Suddenly, something enormous...

87
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,915
...crashed and rumbled
through the eerie woods."

88
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,567
What's that?

89
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,855
Excuse me.

90
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,860
Would it be all right
if I joined you this evening?

91
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:47,450
You see, I've been traveling all day.

92
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,515
Aha!

93
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,938
Now I see why you picked this camp.

94
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:32,161
A delicious-Iooking limestone rock!

95
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,000
Nice bouquet.

96
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:41,212
Must be a real vintage year.

97
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,133
Yes, you're right.

98
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:49,053
Those delicious rocks
are why we've camped here.

99
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,057
- Is he a nut case?
- He's a Rockbiter.

100
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,101
A Rock... A Rockbiter!

101
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,119
Sorry.
- Poor baby.

102
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,334
Pardon me.

103
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:25,423
That was limestone,
with a dash of quartz.

104
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,135
Very tasty.

105
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,804
Where I come from in the North...

106
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,767
...we used to have
exquisite gourmet rocks.

107
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,520
Only now...

108
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,397
Now...

109
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,442
They're all gone.

110
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,445
I know how it happened.

111
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,115
I swear it wasn't me.

112
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,786
No, I think I know what it was.
Tell us more.

113
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:59,749
Near my home,
there used to be a beautiful lake...

114
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,417
...but then...

115
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,004
Then it was gone.

116
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:09,926
- Did the lake dry up?
- No. It just wasn't there anymore.

117
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:15,932
Nothing was there anymore.
Not even a dried-up lake.

118
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,977
- A hole?
- A hole would be something.

119
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,146
No, it was Nothing.

120
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,651
And it got bigger and bigger.

121
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,696
First, there was no lake anymore.

122
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:34,367
And then, finally, no rocks.

123
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:44,293
If he keeps stuffing his face,
there won't be any rocks left here.

124
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,339
Night Hob, this could be serious!

125
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,760
What you said is also happening
where I live in the West.

126
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,055
A strange Nothing
is destroying everything.

127
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,727
Yes. We Night Hobs live in the South
and it's there too.

128
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,146
So it's...

129
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:07,567
It's not just in our part of Fantasia?

130
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:12,739
Maybe it's already everywhere.

131
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:23,791
Maybe our whole land is in danger.
What can we do?

132
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,796
My people sent me to the Ivory Tower,
to the Empress, for help.

133
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,299
We are on the same...

134
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:36,387
We are on the same mission.
If the Empress can't save us...

135
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,764
...who could?

136
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,600
Why are we all just sitting here...

137
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,103
...instead of taking off
for the Ivory Tower?

138
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,274
- What are we waiting for?
- Yes. Let's go now.

139
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,525
Wake up!

140
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,238
- Come on, old girl.
- We can't just hang around here.

141
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,451
Wake up! Ready for takeoff.
Oh, stupid bat!

142
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,955
We can't wait for a snail.
Can I carry you?

143
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,751
Don't worry. It's a racing snail.

144
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,881
But we can't even wait
for a racing snail...

145
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,633
Tallyho!

146
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,095
It really is a racing snail.

147
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,556
Nobody cares about me
and my stupid bat.

148
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:35,530
Maybe I'll take a few
of these yummy gourmet rocks...

149
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,032
...for the road.

150
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,626
Oh, no!

151
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,849
The Nothing!

152
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,992
Look!

153
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,703
There it is!

154
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,248
The heart of Fantasia!

155
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:52,106
I never knew it was that beautiful.

156
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,288
Stay awake!

157
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,000
I told you to stay awake.

158
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,509
The home of the Empress.

159
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,678
She's our only hope.

160
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,340
Friends, I know why you are all here.

161
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,634
The Nothing...

162
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,139
...is destroying our world.

163
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,227
I also know that you...

164
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,355
...have come to beseech...

165
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,774
...the Empress for help.

166
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,486
But l...

167
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,740
I have terrible news.

168
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,204
The Empress herself
has become deathly ill.

169
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:19,712
There seems to be a mysterious link
between her illness and the Nothing.

170
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,466
She's dying.

171
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,556
So she cannot save...

172
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,932
...us.

173
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,646
But there just might be one chance.

174
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,570
The plains people
who hunt the purple buffalo...

175
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,906
...have a great warrior.

176
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,452
He alone has a chance
to fight the Nothing and save us.

177
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,581
He is our only hope.

178
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,045
His name is Atreyu.

179
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,483
Atreyu.

180
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:36,247
"The Empress had already
sent for the great warrior.

181
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:40,668
When he finally appeared
on the terrace of the Ivory Tower...

182
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,631
...he carried with him
the hopes of all Fantasia."

183
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,358
A little boy!

184
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:10,030
I'm sorry, but this is not
the time nor place for children.

185
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,950
- You must leave.
- lf you don't want me...

186
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,536
...you shouldn't have sent for me.

187
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,540
Is he a nut case?

188
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:24,503
- It wasn't you we sent for but Atreyu.
- I am Atreyu.

189
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,134
Not Atreyu the child.
Atreyu the warrior.

190
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,179
I am the only Atreyu.

191
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,724
I'm happy to return
to hunting buffalo.

192
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,852
No, wait!

193
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,274
Come back, please.

194
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,413
If you really are
the Atreyu we sent for...

195
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,583
...you would be willing
to go on a quest?

196
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,545
Yes, of course.

197
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,048
What kind of a quest?

198
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,384
To find a cure for the Empress...

199
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,055
...and to save our world.

200
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:21,769
No one can give you
any advice except this:

201
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,105
You must go alone.

202
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,068
You must leave
all your weapons behind.

203
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,864
It will be very dangerous.

204
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:39,370
- Is there any chance of success?
- I do not know.

205
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,289
But if you fail...

206
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,334
...the Empress will surely die...

207
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,505
...and our whole world
will be destroyed.

208
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,610
When do I begin?

209
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,614
Now. And you must hurry.

210
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,909
The Nothing grows stronger every day.

211
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,916
Take this.

212
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,552
The Auryn!

213
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:47,605
He who wears the Auryn
speaks for the Empress.

214
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,275
It will guide and protect you.

215
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,749
- Wake up.
- Farewell, Atreyu!

216
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,918
Take care.

217
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:51,126
"At the same time,
elsewhere in Fantasia...

218
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:56,715
...a creature of darkness
also began his quest.

219
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:22,199
They had been traveling aimlessly
for almost a week...

220
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,494
...but they could not find a cure.

221
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:30,582
Neither Atreyu nor his horse,
Artax, had the vaguest suspicion...

222
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,336
...that the Creature of Darkness,
the G'mork...

223
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,006
...was already tracking them down."

224
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,851
What is it, Artax?

225
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,439
Is it time to go already?

226
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:59,069
I know what you want.
It's time to eat.

227
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,949
Good idea.

228
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,202
No, it's a great idea!

229
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,183
Not too much.

230
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:33,061
We still have a long way to go.

231
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:40,045
"Atreyu and Artax had searched
the Silver Mountains...

232
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:44,258
...the Desert of Shattered Hopes
and the Crystal Towers...

233
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,218
...without success.

234
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,680
And so there was
only one chance left.

235
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,183
To find Morla, the Ancient One...

236
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,811
...the wisest being in Fantasia...

237
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,730
...whose home was
the Shell Mountain...

238
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,986
...somewhere in the deadly
Swamps of Sadness."

239
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,455
Come on, boy. Come on.

240
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,347
That's it, boy.

241
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,350
It's okay.

242
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:40,147
"Everyone knew that whoever
let the sadness overtake him...

243
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,649
...would sink into the swamp."

244
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,277
You're doing fine, Artax.

245
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,033
That's right.

246
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,752
Come on.

247
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,842
What's the matter?

248
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,553
What's wrong?

249
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,061
Come on, boy.

250
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,231
What's the matter?

251
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,526
I understand.

252
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,116
It's too difficult for you.

253
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,247
You're sinking! Come on!

254
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,460
Turn around! You have to! Now!

255
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,631
Come on! Artax!

256
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,883
Fight against the sadness!

257
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:57,808
Artax, please. Don't let the sadness
of the swamps get to you.

258
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:01,436
You have to try. You have to care.

259
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,689
For me.

260
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,692
You're my friend. I love you.

261
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:15,283
Stupid horse!
You gotta move or you'll die!

262
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,036
Move. Please!

263
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,581
I won't give up! Don't quit!

264
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,844
The Shell Mountain.

265
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,770
Morla, the Ancient One.

266
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,985
Morla!

267
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,919
Huh?

268
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,886
But that's impossible.
They couldn't have heard me.

269
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,932
Are you Morla, the Ancient One?

270
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:15,065
Not that it matters...

271
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,942
...but yes.

272
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:21,112
Please help me. Do you recognize this?

273
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,198
Well...

274
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,742
...we haven't seen...

275
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:30,538
...the Auryn in a long time.

276
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,374
We?

277
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,961
Is someone else here too?

278
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,923
We haven't spoken to anyone else...

279
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:44,552
...for thousands of years.

280
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,431
So we started talking...

281
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,977
...to ourselves.

282
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,659
I bring terrible news.
Did you know the Empress is ill?

283
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,997
Not that it matters, but yes.

284
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:17,377
- Actually, we don't care.
- lf I don't save her, she'll die.

285
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,380
The Nothing is sweeping over the land.

286
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:25,176
- Don't you care about that?
- We don't even care...

287
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,513
...whether or not we care.

288
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,523
- Do you have a cold?
- No.

289
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:44,195
We're allergic to youth.

290
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,496
- Do you know how to help the Empress?
- Not that it matters...

291
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,874
...but yes.

292
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,836
Tell me! If the Nothing comes,
you'll die too!

293
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,881
- Both of you!
- Die?

294
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,344
That, at least, would be something.

295
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,107
Please help.
You said you knew the answ...

296
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,778
We're tired of sneezing.

297
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:29,199
Go away! Nothing matters.

298
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:34,162
That's not true. If it didn't
matter to you, you could tell me.

299
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,751
- Clever boy.
- Tell me, please!

300
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,338
We don't know.

301
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,174
But you can ask...

302
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,011
...the Southern Oracle.
- How can I get there?

303
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,139
You can't.

304
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,309
It's 10,000...

305
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,187
...miles away.

306
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,985
- But that's so far.
- That's right.

307
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,823
Forget it.

308
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,325
Give up.

309
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,709
No.

310
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,880
Atreyu wouldn't quit now.

311
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,894
Oh, boy!

312
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,699
"After days and nights
of unconsciousness...

313
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,619
...Atreyu slowly opened his eyes...

314
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,999
...and found himself
in strange surroundings.

315
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,128
He was clean and
his wounds were dressed."

316
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,854
Leaving so soon?

317
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:04,742
I was just going to... I have to...

318
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,161
- I was trying to...
- Sneak away?

319
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,497
Yeah. I mean, no!

320
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,834
- I like children.
- For breakfast?

321
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,798
Never. I'm a luck dragon.

322
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,009
My name is Falkor.

323
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:26,013
- And my name is...
- Atreyu. And you're on a quest.

324
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:30,101
- How did you know that?
- You were unconscious.

325
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,062
And you talked in your sleep.

326
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,067
Could you get around...

327
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,280
...and scratch behind my right ear?

328
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,324
I can never quite reach it.

329
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,124
Here?

330
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,054
That's so good.

331
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,140
Thank you.

332
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:16,147
So, little fellow, you're on your way
to the Southern Oracle?

333
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,150
Yes. But it's hopeless.

334
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,154
- It's too far away.
- I wouldn't necessarily say that.

335
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:29,494
- You know how to get there?
- Sure. It's right around the corner.

336
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,746
How did all this happen?

337
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,791
With luck.

338
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,669
You brought me
the entire 10,000 miles?

339
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:44,634
Only 9891...

340
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,805
...as the dragon flies.
- You're amazing!

341
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:54,477
Having a luck dragon with you
is the only way to go on a quest.

342
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,356
Things will work out fine, Atreyu.

343
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:03,653
Never give up
and good luck will find you.

344
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,740
It's good to have a friend again.

345
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,912
You have more than one.

346
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,499
Look.

347
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,435
Get out of my light.
You're disturbing my scientific work.

348
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,563
You and your scientific work.

349
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,692
What the boy needs now
is one of my potions.

350
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,696
The boy will need
my scientific advice much more.

351
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:35,661
But not until he's well.
Get back to your own corner, Engy.

352
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,248
I'm always finding you in my place.

353
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,461
He's well!

354
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,965
- Now it's my turn with him.
- Oh, no, you don't!

355
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,802
I decide when he's well.
I say when it's your turn.

356
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:58,017
- Little man, still in pain?
- It's all right.

357
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:02,730
I like that! The patient telling
the doctor it's all right?

358
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,900
It has to hurt if it's to heal.

359
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,652
Here.

360
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,780
Drink that.

361
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,116
Good?

362
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,869
That's my batwing broth...

363
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,790
...with eye of newt,
tree mold, old lizard brains...

364
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,876
...scales from a rancid sea serpent.

365
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:28,130
Just where did you
and your dragon come from?

366
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,302
What are you on to? Anything of
interest to the scientific community?

367
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:37,056
I'm Atreyu. I came to find
the Southern Oracle.

368
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:41,477
- Here we go again.
- You've come to the right place.

369
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,647
I am an expert on the Southern Oracle.

370
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,733
It is my scientific specialty.

371
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,653
"It's my scientific specialty."

372
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:55,533
Why don't you sit down
and be quiet for once?

373
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,869
You keep quiet, wench. It's my turn.

374
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:06,293
My name is Engywook.
She's Urgl. Ever heard of me?

375
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,754
I don't think so.

376
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,757
You don't move in scientific circles.

377
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,844
I am the expert
on the Southern Oracle.

378
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,555
You've come to the right place.

379
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:23,144
- There's no fool like an old fool.
- Wait! Stay here.

380
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,647
The observatory. To the winch, wench.

381
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:36,490
Come on, lazybones!
Can't you go any faster?

382
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,412
I've studied the Southern Oracle
for years.

383
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,831
One day I'll publish my book:

384
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:48,002
A Century of Studying
the Southern Oracle.

385
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,297
Volume l: The Early Years.

386
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,925
Have you been to the Southern Oracle?

387
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:59,221
What do you think?
I work scientifically.

388
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,204
Look.

389
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,005
Is that the Southern Oracle?

390
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:37,384
It's the first of the two gates
you must pass through...

391
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,179
...before you reach
the Southern Oracle...

392
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:44,266
...and get me the final
information for my book.

393
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:48,687
Of course, most people...

394
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,148
...never get that far.

395
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,692
Why?

396
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:57,613
The Sphinxes' eyes
stay closed until someone...

397
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:02,618
...who does not feel his own worth
tries to pass by.

398
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:14,505
Here comes one that looks fancy.

399
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:23,180
Let's see what he really
thinks of himself.

400
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,932
Look, look.

401
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,857
Go on, scaredy-cat!

402
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,151
Oh, go on!

403
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:39,989
It's my turn. Let me see.
I'm the scientist.

404
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,574
He's going on.

405
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,827
I think he'll make it.

406
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:50,374
The Sphinxes' eyes,
are they open or shut? Let me see.

407
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,750
They're shut.

408
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,670
No, wait!

409
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,631
The eyes are opening!

410
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,232
Did he make it? Did he?

411
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,867
Fancy armor doesn't help.

412
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:30,497
The Sphinxes can see
straight into your heart.

413
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,670
Listen, next time
let me see what happens.

414
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,172
It's my telescope.

415
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,261
- I'm gonna try.
- No!

416
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:48,599
Don't go yet.
I haven't told you...

417
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:53,145
...about the next gate.
It's even worse than this one.

418
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,605
Atreyu!

419
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,811
He'll never make it.
He'll never make it!

420
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:10,366
Don't start to doubt yourself.
Be confident!

421
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,832
Be confident. Be confident!

422
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,300
Run, Atreyu, run!

423
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,551
Run, Atreyu!

424
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:34,932
Run! Now!

425
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,907
He made it! He made it!

426
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,125
He made it!

427
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,633
You could use a dose of vitamins too.

428
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:15,139
He made it! Atreyu made it
through the Sphinx gate.

429
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,267
- I always said he could do it.
- Oh, good!

430
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:23,856
But that's no reason
to fall out of the basket again.

431
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,316
I knew he would be safe.

432
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:31,113
Nonsense!
You don't understand anything.

433
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:36,618
The worst one is coming up.
Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.

434
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:41,498
- Atreyu has to face his true self.
- So what?

435
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:46,962
- That won't be too hard for him.
- That's what everyone thinks.

436
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:50,716
But kind people find
that they are cruel.

437
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,928
Brave men discover
that they are really cowards.

438
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,556
Confronted with their true selves...

439
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:01,560
...most men run away screaming.

440
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,596
Now this is going too far.

441
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,658
What if they...

442
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,621
...really do know about me
in Fantasia?

443
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,088
The Southern Oracle?

444
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,859
Do not be afraid.

445
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,445
We will not harm you.

446
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,991
We have been waiting for you...

447
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,495
...a long time, Atreyu.

448
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,834
Are you the Southern Oracle?

449
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,919
Yes, we are.

450
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,965
Then you must know
what can save Fantasia.

451
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:03,009
Yes, we do.

452
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:07,055
Well, what is it? I have to know!

453
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,515
The Empress...

454
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,768
...needs...

455
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:14,062
...a new name.

456
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,816
A new name?

457
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,111
That's all? But that's easy.

458
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,574
I can give her any name she wants.

459
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,910
No one from Fantasia...

460
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,954
...can do it.

461
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:34,291
Only a human child...

462
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,711
...can give her this new name.

463
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,219
A human child? Where can I find one?

464
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,514
You can only find one...

465
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:54,728
...beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.

466
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,403
If you want to save our world...

467
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,363
...you must hurry!

468
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,285
We don't know...

469
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:14,581
...how much longer
we can withstand the Nothing.

470
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,587
Falkor!

471
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:45,195
The Nothing's everywhere.
- Don't worry.

472
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:48,907
We'll reach
the boundaries of Fantasia.

473
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:53,620
- Do you know where they are?
- I have no idea.

474
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:58,750
- Then how do we find a human child?
- With luck.

475
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,629
Faster, Falkor! We have to hurry.

476
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,091
All right, hang on tight!

477
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:25,819
Wow!

478
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,541
What a shame they don't ask me.

479
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,668
My mother...

480
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,172
...she had such a wonderful name.

481
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:47,025
"On and on they flew until they
reached the Sea of Possibilities...

482
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:50,320
...where they could go no further."

483
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,491
Look, Atreyu. The Nothing!

484
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,686
- Falkor!
- Atreyu!

485
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,593
Atreyu.

486
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,708
Falkor!

487
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:33,214
Falkor! Where are you?

488
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,884
Falkor!

489
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:58,239
Atreyu! Where are you?

490
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,658
Atreyu!

491
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,662
Falkor!

492
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,505
Atreyu!

493
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:52,085
They look like big...

494
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:56,548
...good, strong hands, don't they?

495
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,720
I always thought
that's what they were.

496
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,852
My little friends.

497
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:12,272
The little man
with his racing snail...

498
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,691
...the Night Hob...

499
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,111
...even the stupid bat.

500
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:22,031
I couldn't hold on to them.

501
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,367
The Nothing...

502
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:29,330
...pulled them right out of my hands.

503
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,958
I failed.

504
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,461
No, you didn't fail.
I'm the one who failed.

505
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,715
I was the one chosen
to stop the Nothing.

506
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,302
But I lost the Auryn.

507
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,721
I can't find my luck dragon.

508
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:49,142
I won't be able to get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

509
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:58,526
Listen.

510
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:03,031
The Nothing will be here any minute.

511
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:06,492
I will just sit here...

512
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:09,579
...and let it take me away too.

513
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,041
They look...

514
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,251
...like good...

515
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,337
...strong...

516
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:20,256
...hands. Don't they?

517
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,862
Morla?

518
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,659
Artax!

519
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,788
Artax.

520
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,004
If you come any closer...

521
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:27,216
...I will rip you to shreds.

522
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:34,640
Who are you?

523
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:38,269
I am G'mork.

524
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:41,689
And you, whoever you are...

525
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:47,653
...can have the honor
of being my last victim.

526
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:54,452
I will not die easily. I am a warrior.

527
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,081
Brave warrior.

528
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:01,667
- Then fight the Nothing.
- But I can't!

529
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:05,380
I can't get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

530
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,009
- What's so funny about that?
- Fantasia...

531
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,304
...has no boundaries.

532
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,062
That's not true. You're lying.

533
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,523
Foolish boy.

534
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:28,528
Don't you know anything
about Fantasia?

535
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:32,490
It's the world of human fantasy.

536
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,452
Every part...

537
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,038
...every creature of it...

538
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:44,168
...is a piece of the dreams
and hopes of mankind.

539
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:47,672
Therefore...

540
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,676
...it has no boundaries.

541
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:01,144
Why is Fantasia dying then?

542
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:06,149
Because people have begun
to lose their hopes...

543
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:09,610
...and forget their dreams.

544
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,197
So the Nothing grows stronger.

545
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:18,369
- What is the Nothing?
- It's the emptiness that's left.

546
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:24,459
It is like a despair
destroying this world.

547
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:29,005
And I have been trying to help it.

548
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:34,969
- But why?
- Because people who have no hopes...

549
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,430
...are easy to control.

550
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:42,351
And whoever has the control...

551
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,438
...has the power.

552
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,038
Who are you, really?

553
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:05,291
I am the servant...

554
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,462
...of the power behind the Nothing.

555
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:14,050
I was sent to kill the only one...

556
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:17,011
...who could have stopped the Nothing.

557
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:20,598
I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.

558
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,017
His name...

559
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,269
...was Atreyu.

560
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:34,237
If we're about to die anyway,
I'd rather die fighting!

561
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:37,823
Come for me, G'mork. I am Atreyu!

562
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,294
Falkor!

563
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:49,205
"That was the end of Fantasia.

564
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:52,833
Only a few fragments
of this once rich...

565
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:57,755
...and beautiful world
had been left by the Nothing."

566
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,016
Good old Falkor.

567
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:13,354
Can you see anything?
Anything at all?

568
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,106
No.

569
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,983
All the land is gone.

570
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:22,988
I know. And all because I failed.

571
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,074
You tried.

572
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,494
Could the Ivory Tower
still be standing?

573
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:33,207
Let's hope so, Atreyu.
Let's hope so.

574
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,672
Let the Auryn guide you.

575
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:45,720
If the Ivory Tower still stands,
take us there.

576
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,986
Falkor!

577
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,199
The Ivory Tower!

578
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:11,639
The Empress.

579
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:37,915
Go on.

580
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,372
Atreyu.

581
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,751
Why do you look so sad?

582
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:42,146
I have failed you, Empress.

583
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:47,776
No. You haven't.

584
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,446
You brought him with you.

585
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,657
Who?

586
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,994
The earthling child.

587
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:01,332
The one who can save us all.

588
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,668
You knew about the earthling child?

589
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:09,757
Of course. I knew everything.

590
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:13,928
My horse died, I nearly drowned...

591
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:19,141
...I barely escaped from the Nothing
to find out what you already knew?

592
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,978
It was the only way to get
in touch with an earthling.

593
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:26,565
But I didn't get in touch
with an earthling!

594
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,276
Yes, you did.

595
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:32,696
He has suffered with you.

596
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:36,784
He went through everything
you went through.

597
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:40,329
And now, he has come here...

598
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,081
...with you.

599
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:46,335
He is very close, listening...

600
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:48,587
...to every word...

601
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,882
...we say.

602
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,133
What?

603
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:12,736
Where is he? If he's so close,
why doesn't he arrive?

604
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:22,413
He doesn't realize he's already
part of The Neverending Story.

605
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,459
The Neverending Story? What's that?

606
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:33,757
Just as he is sharing all your
adventures, others are sharing his.

607
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:39,972
They were with him when he hid
from the boys in the bookstore.

608
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:43,684
But that's impossible!

609
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:46,729
They were with him
when he took the book...

610
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,565
...with the Auryn symbol
on the cover...

611
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:52,985
...in which he's reading
his own story...

612
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:55,571
...right now.

613
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,370
I can't believe it.

614
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:06,623
They can't be talking about me.

615
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:14,882
- What if he doesn't appear?
- Then our world will disappear.

616
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,051
And so will I.

617
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,557
- How can he let that happen?
- He doesn't see...

618
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:26,602
...he's the one
with the power to stop it.

619
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:32,399
He simply can't imagine that one
little boy could be that important.

620
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,737
Is it really me?

621
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:41,909
- Maybe he doesn't know what to do!
- What do I have to do?

622
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:45,245
He has to give me a new name.

623
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:48,373
He's already chosen it.

624
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,626
He just has to call it out.

625
01:24:54,714 --> 01:24:58,258
But it's only a story. It's not real.

626
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:01,386
Atreyu, no!

627
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:02,888
Atreyu!

628
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:28,205
Bastian!

629
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:34,044
Why don't you do
what you dream, Bastian?

630
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:37,631
But I can't!
I must keep my feet on the ground!

631
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,550
Call my name.

632
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:45,430
Bastian, please!

633
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,517
Save us!

634
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:54,148
All right! I'll do it!
I'll save you! I will do what I dream!

635
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:08,745
Moon Child!

636
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,551
Why is it so dark?

637
01:26:22,802 --> 01:26:27,222
In the beginning, it is always dark.

638
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,270
What is that?

639
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:36,273
One grain of sand.

640
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:40,569
It is all that remains
of my vast empire.

641
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:50,287
Fantasia has totally disappeared?

642
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,166
Yes.

643
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,838
Then everything's been in vain.

644
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,674
No, it hasn't.

645
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:06,845
Fantasia can arise in you...

646
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:10,474
...from your dreams and wishes.

647
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,812
- How?
- Open your hand.

648
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:33,330
What are you going to wish for?

649
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,084
I don't know.

650
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:42,631
Then there will be
no Fantasia anymore.

651
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:49,179
How many wishes do I get?

652
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,516
As many as you want.

653
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,686
And the more wishes you make...

654
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:59,523
...the more magnificent
Fantasia will become.

655
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:01,275
Really?

656
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:03,568
Try it.

657
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:19,001
Then my first wish is...

658
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:31,305
Falkor, it's even more beautiful
than I thought!

659
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:45,694
- Like it?
- Falkor, it's wonderful!

660
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:54,453
It's like the Nothing never was!

661
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,931
Atreyu! Artax!

662
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:31,990
What would you like to wish for next?

663
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:03,688
Look, there they are!

664
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:06,817
It's a monster!

665
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:11,279
Get them! Let's see
how you like it, chickens!

666
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:12,906
Down here!

667
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,381
We're gonna get you!

668
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,410
Bastian made many other wishes...

669
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:02,038
...and had many other
amazing adventures...

670
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:06,418
...before he finally returned
to the ordinary world.

671
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:09,171
But that's another story.
