1
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,640
There are over 550 million firearms

2
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,960
in world-wide circulation.

3
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,480
That's one firearm for every

4
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,680
twelve people on the planet.

5
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,720
The only question is...

6
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,200
how do we arm the other eleven?

7
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,480
You don't have to worry.

8
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,760
I'm not gonna tell you a pack of
lies to make me look good.

9
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm just gonna tell you
what happened.

10
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,040
My name is Yuri Orlov.

11
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,320
When I was a boy,
my family came to America.

12
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,080
But not all the way.

13
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,080
Like most Ukrainians,

14
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,440
we gathered in Brighton Beach.

15
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,840
It reminded us of the Black Sea.

16
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,440
I soon realized we'd just swapped

17
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,480
one hell for another.

18
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Even in hell, an angel

19
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,120
sometimes makes an appearance.

20
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,760
I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine

21
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,800
since I was 10 years old.

22
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,520
Of course, she didn't know I existed.

23
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
I was starting to think she had a point.

24
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,080
For the first twenty-odd years of my life...

25
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,880
...Little Odessa was to me what it
is to the Q train...

26
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,640
...the end of the line.

27
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
"Little Odessa," New York - 1982

28
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,640
Oh, I did lie about my name.

29
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,760
It's not really Yuri Orlov.

30
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,760
There've been few occasions
in the in the 20th century...

31
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200
when it's been an advantage be a Jew.

32
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
But in the 'seventies,
to escape the Soviet Union,

33
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,880
our family pretended to be Jewish.

34
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,680
Little about my life has been
kosher ever since

35
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,320
How's it going, brother?

36
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
It's not.

37
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,320
That's Vitaly, my younger brother.

38
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,640
He was as lost as me.

39
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
He didn't know it yet.

40
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,000
Yuri,

41
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,440
you're late.

42
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,000
My father took his assumed
identity to heart.

43
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,400
He was more Jewish than most Jews.

44
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,560
Which drove my Catholic mother crazy.

45
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,640
How many times?

46
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't eat shellfish.

47
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,760
It's treyf.

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,080
You're not Jewish.

49
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,520
I like it.

50
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,320
I like the hat.

51
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,320
To remind us there is something...

52
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,640
above us.

53
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,040
I like that.

54
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,560
I'm going to temple.

55
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,560
You're not going to temple.

56
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,640
You go to temple more than the rabbi.

57
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,120
Get off my back, woman.

58
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,400
God, will you ever wise up?

59
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,960
Yuri, don't forget to check

60
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,040
the specials at the Palace.

61
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Growing up in Little Odessa,

62
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
murder was everyday part of life.

63
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,840
Russian mobsters had also
migrated

64
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,160
from the Soviet Union

65
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
and when they came to America,

66
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
their baggage came with them.

67
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,640
There was always some gangster

68
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,200
getting whacked in my
neighborhood,

69
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,600
but I'd never seen it with my own eyes.

70
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,640
I had this knack of showing up
five minutes before something went down,

71
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,280
or five minutes after.

72
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
Not that day.

73
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
It hit me.

74
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,480
It couldn't have hit me harder

75
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,680
if I was the one who'd been shot.

76
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,320
You go into the restaurant business...

77
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,640
because people are always going
to have to eat.

78
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,520
That was the day I realized my destiny...

79
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,840
...lay in fulfilling another basic
human need.

80
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,720
The next Sabbath,
I went to temple with my father.

81
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
However, it wasn't God
I was trying to get close to.

82
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Eli, my eldest son, Yuri.

83
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,920
My contact at synagogue landed me

84
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,960
my first Israeli-made Uzi
submachine guns.

85
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,360
The first time you sell a gun...

86
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,840
is a lot like the first time you have sex.

87
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing.

88
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,720
But it is exciting and one way
or another,

89
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,880
it's over way too fast.

90
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,640
Gentlemen.

91
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,000
The new Uzi machine pistol.

92
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
Big firepower in a small package.

93
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,680
This little baby uses 9 mm hollow points.

94
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,880
Twenty twenty-five round extendable mags...

95
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,320
...rear-flip adjustable sights.

96
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,440
Silencer comes standard.
Excellent recoil reduction.

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,920
Muzzle jump reduced forty percent.

98
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,640
Sixty percent improved noise
suppression.

99
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,440
You could pump a mag into me

100
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,840
right now

101
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,000
and never wake the guy
in the next room.

102
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,640
Of course, that would eliminate your

103
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,920
opportunity for repeat business.

104
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,480
I did have a natural instinct

105
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
for smuggling contraband.

106
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,280
Fortunately, back then a video camera

107
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,680
was a big as a bazooka

108
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,480
Here I'd been running away from violence

109
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,880
my whole life, and I should've
run towards it.

110
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,800
It's in our nature.

111
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,440
The earliest human skeletons had

112
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,000
spearheads in their rib cages.

113
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,320
Where have you been?

114
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,960
What if we had a customer?

115
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,840
God bless America.

116
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,920
Beware of the dog?
You don't have a dog.

117
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,040
Are you trying to scare people?

118
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,680
No, it's to scare me.

119
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,280
Remind me to be aware of the dog in me.

120
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
The dog wants to fuck everything
that moves

121
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,880
Wants to fight and kill weaker dogs.

122
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,680
I guess it's to remind me to be
more human.

123
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,640
Isn't being a dog part of being human?

124
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,360
What if that's the best part of you?
The dog part.

125
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,360
What if you're really just a
two-legged dog?

126
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
You need to see somebody.

127
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,440
Stinks in here.

128
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,480
I'd always wanted to do something
big with my life

129
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,520
I just didn't know what.

130
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,680
Anyhow, I figured,

131
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,480
if I was going into the gun trade,

132
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
I was going aim high.

133
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Vitaly, stop fucking around.

134
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,440
I want to talk to you.

135
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,840
You read the newspapers, Vit?

136
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,880
Newspaper? It's always the same.

137
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,200
You're right.

138
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,200
Every day there's people shooting
each other.

139
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,320
You know what I do when I see that?

140
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,720
I look to see what guns they're using

141
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,840
and I think to myself, why not my guns?

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,120
What, are you opening a gun shop?

143
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,000
Already more of those in than
McDonald's.

144
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,840
Even with all the gangsters around here,

145
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,480
the margins are too low.

146
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,120
You've figured the margins?
Sure.

147
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,760
Forget gang wars.

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,880
The real money is in actual wars.

149
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,680
Between countries.

150
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Yuri, what the fuck do you know
about guns?

151
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,840
I know which end I'd rather be on.

152
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,680
I made the first sale.

153
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,960
We're already in business.

154
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,600
Whoa, whoa. We?

155
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,480
I need a partner.

156
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,240
I don't know,

157
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,880
I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.

158
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,680
Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.

159
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,760
You're no fucking chef.

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I can eat in the restaurant for free

161
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,080
and I still don't eat there.

162
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,280
Fuck you.

163
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,920
We're doing nothing with our lives.

164
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,480
I mean, this is shit!

165
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,040
This is shit!

166
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,400
It's true.

167
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,200
But maybe doing nothing's
better than doing this.

168
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,240
I need you.

169
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,560
Brothers in arms.

170
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,440
Brothers in arms.

171
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,920
Sir, may I interest you in the

172
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,600
shoulder-fired SA-7
surface-to-air missiles?

173
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,920
The older Chinese model.

174
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,120
Not so effective against

175
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,120
modern military aircraft. But deadly...

176
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
if used against a commercial airliner.

177
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,240
I'm giving them away at 8-50.

178
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,680
In the '80s, and the Cold War was
far from thawed

179
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,120
Most of the deals were
government-to-government.

180
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,560
It was a mostly private club...

181
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,000
...with a lifetime club president.

182
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,120
That's him.
The big shot?

183
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,840
Simeon Weisz, Angola,
Mozambique,

184
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,400
those Exocet missiles
in the Falklands.

185
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,000
He was selling guns before
there was gunpowder.

186
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,240
Be right back.

187
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,600
Mr. Weisz? Mr. Weisz!

188
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,160
It's okay, they're talking.

189
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,840
May I help?

190
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman

191
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,480
from Brighton Beach,

192
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,800
import/export said to contact you.

193
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,240
I have a business proposal

194
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,680
and I thought perhaps we could
discuss it.

195
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,680
I don't think you and I are
in the same business.

196
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,520
You think I just sell guns,
don't you?

197
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,160
I don't. I take sides.

198
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,200
But in the Iran-Iraq war
you sold guns to both sides.

199
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,960
Did you ever consider that
I wanted both sides to lose?

200
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,800
Bullets change governments far
surer than votes.

201
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,200
You're in the wrong place,
my young friend.

202
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,400
This is no place for amateurs.

203
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,040
Motherfucker.

204
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,840
Curious how you always revert to
your native tongue

205
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,520
in moments of extreme anger.

206
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,200
And ecstasy.

207
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,520
Oh God... Oh, God!

208
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,120
You are beautiful.

209
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,280
What's your name again?

210
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,520
The only option for Vitaly and me

211
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,880
was under-the-counter gunrunning.

212
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,640
Beirut, Lebanon - 1984

213
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
I got my first break in Lebanon

214
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,640
after the suicide bombing.

215
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,720
But I wasn't the only local kid
making good.

216
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,960
When the United States leaves a war zone...

217
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,880
they generally don't take
their munitions.

218
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,960
It costs more to bring it back

219
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,080
than to buy new stock.

220
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,720
So, we sell by the kilo.

221
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,760
They're secondhand weapons,

222
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,480
but they're still okay.

223
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,160
How many kilos would you like?

224
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,240
Five thousand.

225
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,640
I had a flair for languages...

226
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,520
...but I soon discovered that what
talks best is dollars, dinars...

227
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,080
...drachmas, rubles, rupees, and
pounds-fucking-sterling.

228
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,000
Of course, the U.S. Army got a
piece of the action.

229
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,480
Army salaries were no better then
than they are today.

230
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,400
And some of the brass,

231
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,320
like Lieutenant Colonel Southern...

232
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,080
needed to raise money for their
own private wars.

233
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,160
Good to make your acquaintance.

234
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,400
This is bullshit money,

235
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,520
This is small-fucking-potatoes.

236
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,960
What do you want to do, go more legit?

237
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,840
No, more illegal.

238
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,360
What I would give right now

239
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,880
for cabbage and potatoes.

240
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,240
It's not our fight.

241
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,400
Vit, come on!

242
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,640
Let's go. Come on.

243
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,880
Selling guns is like selling
vacuum cleaners.

244
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,680
You make calls,

245
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,640
pound the pavement,

246
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,640
take orders.

247
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,040
I was an equal opportunity
merchant of death.

248
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,000
I supplied every army but the
Salvation Army.

249
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,400
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.

250
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,400
I sold communist-made bullets
to fascists.

251
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,840
I hope you're not thinking of
selling these, Mr. Orlov.

252
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,320
Personal use.

253
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,280
Personal use.

254
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,160
There's a hundred thousand
bullets here.

255
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm kind of trigger happy.

256
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,440
Trigger happy?

257
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,760
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan

258
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,640
when they were still fighting my
fellow Soviets.

259
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,760
I never sold to Osama Bin Laden.

260
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,160
Not on any moral grounds.

261
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,160
Back then, he was always
bouncing checks.

262
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,920
By the mid-'80s...

263
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,760
my weapons were represented in eight...

264
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,440
...of the world's top ten war zones.

265
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,080
There's no problem leading a double life.

266
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,640
It's the triple and quadruple lives

267
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,080
that get you in the end.

268
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,800
Back then, I carried a... French,
British, Israeli,

269
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,080
and Ukrainian passport...

270
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,800
...and a student visa for the U.S.,

271
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,680
but... that's another story.

272
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,840
I also packed six different briefcases...

273
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,720
...depending on who I was that day

274
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,000
and the region of the world I was visiting.

275
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,360
North of Cartagena, Colombia - 1989

276
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,440
Without operations like mine,

277
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,520
would be impossible for certain
countries

278
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,120
to conduct a respectable war.

279
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,520
I was able to navigate around those

280
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,320
inconvenient little arms embargoes.

281
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,440
There are three basic types
of arms deal.

282
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
White, being legal.

283
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,960
Black, being illegal,

284
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,000
and my personal favorite color, gray.

285
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Sometimes I made the deal
so convoluted...

286
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,760
it was hard for me to work out

287
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
if they were on the level.

288
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,440
To keep authorities in the dark

289
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,320
I often spoke in code.

290
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,840
Rocket launchers were "mothers."

291
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,280
The rockets, "children."

292
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,040
The AK-47 assault rifle was
the "Angel King."

293
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,040
It's Yuri... Yeah. Well, Raoul...

294
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,600
Raoul, the Angel King will arrive tomorrow.

295
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,480
Hallelujah to you, too.

296
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,880
The point is, if I've done my job right

297
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,400
an arms embargo should be
practically impossible to enforce.

298
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,080
What?

299
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay, just slow the fuck down.

300
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,440
I can't understand you.

301
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,400
Wha-What do you mean, tipped off?

302
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,080
They know where we are?
Well, where are they?

303
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,720
Well, how long have I got?
Not long?

304
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,640
What does that mean? Shit!

305
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,360
Do we try to lose them?
On this?

306
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,880
Yuri, we have to get off this thing.

307
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,440
No. No one's going anywhere.

308
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,120
Slow, dead slow. Buy me time.

309
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,040
Yeah, it's Yuri.

310
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,240
Get that fucking rag down!

311
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,000
I need another handle for this tub.

312
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,880
Something in our weight class.

313
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,240
You! Over the side.

314
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,200
We're changing the name. Now!

315
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,040
Yes, it's got to check out.

316
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,240
The way I look at it,

317
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,640
what's in a name?

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,080
Have you got a shorter name?

319
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,200
I'd often changed the registration
of a ship or a plane...

320
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,480
...but never on such short notice.

321
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,080
Damn! They're hauling.

322
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,080
What? Kono? How do you spell
that?

323
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,920
K-O-N-O, okay, well, that's good.

324
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,960
Kono, K-O-N-O.

325
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,800
What are we flying? Dutch? Got it.

326
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,760
Vit, get me a Dutch flag, will you?

327
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,160
Faster! Or I'll send your ass in!

328
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,160
Yuri, I don't have Dutch!
What?

329
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,000
I've got Belgian.
What the fuck use is that?

330
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,000
He's painting a name registered

331
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,880
in the fucking Netherlands.

332
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,320
I've got a French flag.
So?

333
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,960
Turn it sideways...

334
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,720
...it's Dutch.

335
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,560
That's why you're my brother.

336
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,200
All right, good!

337
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,320
Everybody look innocent now.

338
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,600
They say every man has his price.

339
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,280
But not every man gets it.

340
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,120
Interpol Agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought.

341
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,720
At least, not with money.

342
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,080
For Jack, glory was the prize.

343
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,800
Yeah, it's the Kono;
it's not the Kristol.

344
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,120
Kono, K-O-N-O.

345
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,560
It's clean, sir.

346
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,880
It's clean?

347
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,800
It sure doesn't look clean.

348
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,320
I'm going to go aboard.

349
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,120
Phone in a sighting of the
Kristol south of Aruba.

350
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,600
Even when I was up against an
overzealous agent...

351
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,960
...I had a number of methods for
discouraging a search.

352
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,080
I routinely mislabeled my arms shipments

353
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,640
"Farm Machinery."

354
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,240
And I have yet to meet the lowly
paid customs official...

355
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,440
...who will open a container...

356
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,360
...marked "Radioactive Waste"

357
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,520
to verify its contents.

358
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,720
But my personal favorite is
the unique combination...

359
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,400
of week-old potatoes and tropical heat.

360
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,560
Smells.

361
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,560
Sir, Sighting of the Kristol, due north.

362
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,640
Most importantly, I kept a number
of intelligence people

363
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,600
on the payroll to supply their colleagues

364
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,920
with counterintelligence.

365
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Let's go.

366
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,320
The second rule of gunrunning is:

367
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,440
Always ensure you have a
foolproof way to get paid.

368
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,040
Preferably in advance...

369
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,080
ideally to an off-shore account.

370
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,720
That's why I chose my customers
so carefully.

371
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,320
Say what you like about warlords
and dictators...

372
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,920
they tend to have a highly
developed sense of order.

373
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
They always pay their bills on time.

374
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,840
What is this?

375
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,320
Six kilos of pure.

376
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,120
I can't hand this to my fucking bank

377
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,960
teller at Chase Manhattan.

378
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,240
Listen, asshole, you should be
thanking me.

379
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,760
Have you checked the street price today?

380
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
With the seizures at the border last week,

381
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,040
it's jumped thirty percent.

382
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Whoa... whoa-whoa!

383
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,760
I sell guns. I don't sell drugs.

384
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,920
Diversify.

385
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,360
I've got standards.

386
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,960
You don't pay, you don't play.

387
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
Fuck you!

388
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,360
What are you doing?
Fuck you!

389
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,120
Fuck you!

390
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,760
No, you don't fuck him.

391
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,160
We can work something out.

392
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,920
No, Vit!

393
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,040
We have a deal!

394
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,200
The first and most important
rule of gunrunning...

395
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,160
is never get shot with your own
merchandise.

396
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,200
Are you okay?

397
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,440
I think so.

398
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,760
So what do we do now?

399
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,960
Let's celebrate.

400
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,720
That narco guerilla had his facts right.

401
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,920
After shipping it stateside,
the return on that blow

402
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,960
netted me a healthy profit.

403
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
It would have been even better,

404
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,720
except one kilo never made it back.

405
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,880
Vitaly?

406
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,600
Vit!

407
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,560
To this day I don't know what Vitaly...

408
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,160
...was running away from.

409
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,080
Maybe just from Vitaly.

410
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,400
I found him twelve days,
two thousand miles,

411
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,840
and one hundred and fifty grams later

412
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,920
in a Bolivian boarding house.

413
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,960
Of course, my dream girl
had gone there before me.

414
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Vit!

415
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,560
Come on!

416
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,560
Fuck, Yuri's back.

417
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,600
It's my brother, Yuri.

418
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,520
He's my big brother.

419
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,080
What the fuck is that?

420
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,560
Ukraine.

421
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,880
I was young, but I remember.

422
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,880
Look... I start in Odessa, right?

423
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,960
And then I work my way to the
Crimean

424
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,240
You'll be dead before you fucking
reach Kiev!

425
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,240
We're going home. Come on,

426
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,440
You fuck! You fucking fuck!

427
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,480
You fucking fuck...

428
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,760
What the fuck is your problem?

429
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,440
Come on, Vit.

430
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,440
J.F.K. Airport, New York - 1989

431
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,080
Yuri, it's so nice to be home.
Yeah, good work.

432
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,480
We're gonna get you home.

433
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,680
Come on.

434
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,680
St. Francis Rehabilitation Center

435
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,760
Get out of the car.

436
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,520
Vitaly, I need you to get out of the car.

437
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,120
I promised our parents.

438
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,400
Please.

439
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,800
Vitaly, you're going to have a great time.

440
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,760
This is a top place.

441
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,680
Two Ford models checked in last week.

442
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,520
And that cute weather girl's been
here since July.

443
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,040
Please.

444
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,600
Please, Yuri.

445
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,920
You're a good brother.

446
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,200
You're a good brother, Yuri.

447
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,320
Okay. All right.

448
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,280
Good brother.

449
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,080
All right. Get out of the car.

450
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
Okay

451
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,040
Get out of the car.

452
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,920
From then on I was a one-man operation.

453
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,400
I never understood what separated...

454
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,280
the recreational drug user from
the habitual.

455
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,400
But for the grace of God...

456
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,760
it could've been me snorting lines

457
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,960
as long as the Belt Parkway.

458
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,400
However, I wasn't entirely free

459
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,480
of the grip of addiction myself.

460
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,920
There she was again.

461
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,680
Ava Fontaine.

462
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,120
In my neighborhood they say,

463
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,560
"The good get out."

464
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,080
In our own ways, we'd both
conquered the world.

465
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,240
St. Barts, French Caribbean - 1989

466
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,680
You can't force somebody to
fall in love with you.

467
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,000
But you can definitely improve your odds.

468
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,720
It cost me 20 grand to book he
for a fake photo shoot.

469
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,160
Another twelve to buy out the hotel.

470
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,560
Popular hotel, huh?

471
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,440
Ava Fontaine.
Yuri Orlov.

472
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,040
What brings you to St. Barts?

473
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,040
Photo shoot.

474
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,760
At least, that was the plan.

475
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,320
I guess the photographer got
stuck in Miami.

476
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,160
Hurricane. Though there's nothing
on the news.

477
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,040
Those things can come out of nowhere.

478
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,960
So... the job's been cancelled,

479
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,760
and wouldn't you know it,

480
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,120
there's no flight to New York until Tuesday.

481
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,400
You can hitch a ride with me if you like.

482
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm leaving tomorrow.

483
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,320
Meanwhile, why don't I take your picture?

484
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,160
In my experience,

485
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,760
some of the most successful
relationships...

486
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,040
are based on lies and deceit.

487
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,920
Since that's where they usually
end up anyway...

488
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,840
it's a logical place to start.

489
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,880
Right there. Hold it there.

490
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,800
Oh, my God!

491
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,880
I nearly went broke trying to
convince her I was anything but.

492
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,120
I knew Ava was not the kind of woman

493
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,000
to be seduced by a ride in a private jet

494
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,800
unless you owned the jet.

495
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,680
This is your plane?

496
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,520
That is my name.

497
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,880
Of course, I was lying.

498
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,320
The plane was rented, like the car

499
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,440
and even the suit I was standing in

500
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,240
At the last minute,

501
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,440
I'd bribed the crew for the paint job.

502
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,520
Luckily, by the time we landed...

503
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,400
Ava wasn't looking anywhere
but in my eyes.

504
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
I had no idea.

505
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,120
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

506
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,240
Don't apologize. I put clothes on
for a living.

507
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,800
A least you're not taking them off.

508
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,760
I would be, if half the...

509
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,760
...photographers had their way.

510
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,440
What about you?

511
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,880
I'm in transport.

512
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,080
International air freight, mostly.

513
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,040
Business is good.

514
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,400
Where're you from?

515
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
I was born in Ukraine,
but I grew up in Brooklyn.

516
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,480
No.

517
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,480
What, you too?

518
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,240
Williamsburg.

519
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Here's to a hurricane.

520
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,800
Without it, I never would have met you.

521
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,360
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

522
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,760
It feels like fate.

523
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,000
I don't believe in fate.

524
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,040
What do you believe in?

525
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,800
Is that a view, or is that a view?

526
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,560
That's a view.

527
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,480
Thank you. Thank you all.

528
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,120
Congratulations.

529
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,120
Congratulations.

530
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,240
Thanks.

531
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,160
Always remember, son...

532
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,640
There is something above you.

533
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,920
Sure, Dad.

534
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,800
A forty-thousand-dollar crystal chandelier.

535
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,000
Make yourselves at home. Go!

536
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,320
Go!

537
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,840
I'm sorry. Today must be tough.

538
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,840
It'd be nice to have a couple
more guests

539
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,680
from my side of the family.

540
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,080
I'm sure they're watching right now.

541
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,520
Thank you.

542
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,560
But you don't believe that, Yuri...

543
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,360
...remember?

544
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,960
I know you, Yuri.

545
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,320
I know you're not everything you seem.

546
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,000
Don't worry, I won't ask a lot of questions.

547
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,920
I don't want to hear you lie.

548
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,880
You take risks.

549
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,680
Just promise me you won't risk us.

550
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,600
That's the trouble with falling in love

551
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
with a dream girl.

552
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,240
They have a habit of becoming real.

553
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,040
I've never been so glad to see Vitaly.

554
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,960
You're fucking beautiful!

555
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,360
Brother...

556
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Brother, thank you so much...

557
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,480
for giving me such a beautiful sister.

558
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,120
He was out of rehab, and out of his mind.

559
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,040
Dance! Dance! We have to dance!

560
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,920
All right, all right
It's a wedding, a celebration

561
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,520
To Yuri!

562
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,000
For once, he rescued me.

563
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
New York - December 25, 1991

564
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,240
I was still living way beyond my means.

565
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,800
Mortgaged to the hilt, using one
credit card to pay another.

566
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,360
Anything to keep Ava in the style to

567
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,760
which she had thanks largely to me

568
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,880
become accustomed.

569
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Ava

570
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,800
Ava, this is too much.

571
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,280
Yuri likes to spoil you.

572
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,120
Then suddenly,

573
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,000
all my Christmases came at once.

574
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,840
Nicki, you did it! Good boy!

575
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,880
That's my grandson!

576
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,080
Yuri, don't you want to see what
your son is doing?

577
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,240
Whoever said it's better to give
than receive...

578
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,560
...never got a Christmas present
like the one I got...

579
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,560
in 1991 from Mikhail Gorbachev.

580
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,720
What the hell's the matter?

581
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
It's over!

582
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,200
What's over?

583
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,480
The Cold-fucking-War!
The Soviet-fucking Union

584
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,880
The Evil fucking-Empire!
Mikhail's saying no mas.

585
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,800
He's throwing in the towel.

586
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,120
It's over!

587
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,200
Your son is walking.

588
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,880
That's incredible, honey.

589
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,400
At least they'll get religious freedom.

590
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,960
Let's hope so.

591
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,720
I think I'll go back for a visit.

592
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,840
Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?

593
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,840
I'm not a fool, Yuri.

594
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,240
I don't think you're going to
Odessa to sell Pepsi-Cola.

595
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,320
Is this how you want to be remembered?

596
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,400
I don't want to be remembered at all.

597
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,920
I'm being remembered,
it means I'm dead.

598
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,440
Merry-fucking-Christmas!

599
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,040
Who is this, Vitaly?

600
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,080
I'm Angel.

601
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,680
Her name really is Angel.

602
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,000
She's a fairy.

603
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,880
Let's put her on top of the
Christmas tree.

604
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,360
Come on

605
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,280
I love you.

606
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,200
Come on.

607
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,800
I love you all.

608
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,240
Take this.

609
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,080
I'm going back to Ukraine.

610
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,200
I miss Odessa.

611
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,240
I miss you.

612
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
I miss you.

613
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,360
Be careful, Yuri. Those things
you sell kill.

614
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,840
Inside.

615
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,720
You're high.

616
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,400
That's true.

617
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,040
Hello, Christian.

618
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,800
Odessa, Ukraine - 1992

619
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,680
During the Cold War, the Red
Army stationed nearly

620
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,320
one million troops in Ukraine...

621
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,680
because of its strategic military importance.

622
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,200
The day after The Wall came down...

623
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,920
the paychecks stopped coming.

624
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,600
Your papers.

625
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,200
There's nothing better for an arms dealer...

626
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,120
combination of disgruntled soldiers

627
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,880
and warehouses full of weapons.

628
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,360
Welcome.

629
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
I was hoping Major General Dmitri Volkoff

630
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,360
would open a lot of armory doors

631
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,440
in a lot of military bases.

632
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,520
For a start, he was family.

633
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,920
He was a highly decorated hero
of the Red Army,

634
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,520
and he was almost permanently
shit-faced

635
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,280
I can't just sell you government
property, Yuri.

636
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,040
I have to report.

637
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,160
Report to who? Moscow?

638
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,800
As of last week

639
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,640
Moscow's in a foreign country.

640
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,960
New flag, new boss.

641
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,920
There is no new boss yet.

642
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,680
They're all too busy squabbling over

643
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,000
who's gonna get the presidential
holiday home

644
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,480
at the Black Sea.

645
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,080
It's beautiful.

646
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,760
The ones who know don't care any more

647
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,720
and the ones who care don't know.

648
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,520
Show me your inventory.

649
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,120
Those 45 years of mutual hatred

650
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
between the East and the West...

651
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,960
had generated the highest weapons

652
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,680
buildup in history.

653
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,640
The Soviets had guns

654
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,240
coming out of the demon hole.

655
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,760
Huge stockpiles, and now no enemy.

656
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,160
How many Kalashnikovs do you have?

657
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,160
Forty thousand.

658
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,600
Is that a four?

659
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,080
It doesn't look like a four to me.

660
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,400
It's more like a one.

661
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
No, it's a four.

662
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,000
It's whatever we say it is.

663
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,480
Because no one else will know
the difference?

664
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,000
Ten thousand Kalashnikovs for
a Your stocks are battalion.

665
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,720
Your stocks are dangerously
depleted, Dmitri.

666
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,560
You should order more from the factory.

667
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,920
Someone will work it out.

668
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,280
What happens then?

669
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,760
We'll cut them in.

670
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,560
The end of the Cold War

671
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,360
was the beginning of the hottest
time in arms dealing.

672
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,640
The arms bazaar was open.

673
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Guided missiles, unguided missiles.

674
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,440
Mortars, mines,

675
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,200
armored personnel carriers.

676
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,000
Whole tank divisions.

677
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,600
I'll tell you what I'll do.

678
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,080
Buy six, you get one free.

679
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,280
I even landed a squadron of
helicopter gunships.

680
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,520
The most sophisticated fighting
machines...

681
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,400
built for a war with America that
never happened.

682
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,400
Son, get off there before you get hurt.

683
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,800
I can take it apart with my eyes closed.

684
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,720
Thanks to me,

685
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,880
they'd finally get to fire a shot in anger.

686
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,760
I have a feeling it wasn't exactly

687
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,680
what Comrade Lenin had in mind

688
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,040
when he advocated the
redistribution of wealth.

689
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,160
But I wasn't the only one

690
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,080
offering a crash course in capitalism.

691
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,480
I had rivals.

692
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,800
Inform your commanding officer

693
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,360
that Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

694
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,840
You don't know who I am, do you?

695
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
I don't give a fuck who you are.

696
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,760
You're late.

697
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,520
So it appears.

698
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,800
Thank you.

699
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,640
My pleasure.

700
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,360
You sell guns?

701
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,560
Maybe you'd like to come to my room

702
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,600
and I'll show you my... cannon.

703
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,400
You look a little lost, Simeon.

704
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,600
Is the world changing too fast?

705
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,160
I'm here, aren't I?

706
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,760
Not all of you, I think.

707
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,160
You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA

708
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,800
you can't seem to get that ideology

709
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,320
completely out of your head.

710
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,560
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

711
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,440
Kept the tensions frozen.

712
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,400
Now it's harder to determine

713
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,840
which side one's on.

714
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,760
Things have become more complicated.

715
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,920
No, it's gotten simpler.

716
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,080
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics anymore,

717
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,520
I sell to leftists and rightists.

718
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,680
I sell to pacifists,

719
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,080
but they're not the most regular of
customers.

720
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,200
Of course, you're not a true
internationalist...

721
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,600
...until you've supplied weapons

722
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,680
to kill your own countrymen.

723
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,600
This current state of chaos won't
last forever.

724
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,880
There'll have to be order.

725
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,960
Instead of cutting each other's throats,

726
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,600
it may be beneficial if we work together.

727
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,160
What do you think?

728
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,320
What do I think?

729
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,320
I think you are the amateur now,

730
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,760
and I think you should go with
your instincts.

731
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,920
With your first instinct.

732
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,120
I'm the same man who was not

733
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,640
good enough for you before...

734
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,080
and I'm just not good enough
for you now.

735
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,000
The problem with gunrunners
going to war

736
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,400
is that there's no shortage of ammunition.

737
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,880
This was the chaos

738
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,600
that the Old Guard had always feared.

739
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,760
As far as they were concerned,

740
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,160
I was giving arms dealers a bad name.

741
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,600
But they could hardly report me
to the Better Business Bureau.

742
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,320
And Ukraine wasn't the only former state...

743
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,480
with an unpaid army and stockpiles of guns.

744
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,120
There was Bulgaria, Hungary,
Poland, Belarus...

745
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,400
all there for the taking.

746
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,840
Of all the weapons in the vast
Soviet arsenal...

747
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,240
nothing was more profitable than
Avtomat Kalashnikova,

748
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,000
model of 1947,

749
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,120
more commonly known as the
AK-47... or kalashnikov.

750
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,920
It's the world's most popular
assault rifle

751
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,960
a weapon all fighters love.

752
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,480
An elegantly simple nine-pound

753
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,200
amalgamation of forged steel
and plywood.

754
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,880
It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.

755
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,560
It will shoot whether it's covered in mud

756
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,120
or filled with sand.

757
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,680
It's so easy, even a child can use it

758
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,680
and they do.

759
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,640
The Soviets put the gun on a coin.

760
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,080
Mozambique put it on their flag.

761
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,440
Since the end of the Cold War,

762
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
the Kalashnikov has become the...

763
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,120
...Russian people's greatest export.

764
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,080
After that comes vodka, caviar,

765
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,960
and suicidal novelists.

766
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,840
One thing's for sure

767
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,440
no one was lining up to buy their cars.

768
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,920
What fucking documents?

769
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,280
You listen to me, Lieutenant.

770
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,640
You keep them there.
For as long as you can!

771
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,320
Fight You listen to me, Lieutenant.

772
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,760
To the death! Moscow is behind us!

773
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,000
It's an order!

774
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,960
I thought you supposed watching
out for these people.

775
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,520
How can I?

776
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,280
You keep selling my helicopters.

777
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,120
You are too greedy, Yuri!

778
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,120
I can't hold him forever.

779
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,280
I've got paperwork.

780
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,000
Not for the gunships.

781
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,280
You know the penalty for

782
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
sanction-busting.

783
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,600
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

784
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,960
Military helicopter.

785
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,240
It's not a military helicopter.

786
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,360
It's a rescue helicopter.

787
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,280
Get to work, son.

788
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,880
No problem.

789
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,720
The law's on our side.

790
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,160
All right, let me see your papers.

791
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,280
No-no-no, put that away.

792
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,760
See your papers.

793
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,040
Yuri Orlov.

794
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,080
Mr. Orlov, always In the wrong
place at the right time.

795
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,040
What the fuck is this?

796
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,360
We've met before.

797
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,320
Off the coast Colombia.

798
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,200
What was the name of that freighter?

799
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,760
I can't remember, was it the Kono
or the Kristol?

800
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,120
The crew called that vessel a lot of names.

801
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,960
None repeatable in polite company.

802
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,640
Answer the question.

803
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,520
The new MP-5.

804
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,520
Would you like a silencer for that?

805
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,560
I need to see your papers.

806
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,680
Get the fuck off me.

807
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,000
Dmitri!

808
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,080
The end-user certificate for this aircraft...

809
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,680
states "Burkina Faso."

810
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,520
Nice, very nice.

811
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,680
Did you type this up yourself?

812
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,120
The helicopter is to be used on
humanitarian missions.

813
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,040
Oh, so you're a humanitarian?

814
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,520
Oh, absolutely.

815
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,720
This is a military aircraft.

816
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,680
Not anymore.
Listen to the nephew!

817
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,280
What can they do with military hardware

818
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,320
but convert it to civilian use?

819
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,240
The only way you could die from this baby

820
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,520
now is if a food drop hits you.

821
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,200
And this stuff over here, huh?

822
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,880
Is it going to Burkina Faso... Ah,

823
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,120
but to a different client at a
different address.

824
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,640
That's just a coincidence is that it?

825
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,360
Do you take me for a complete
fucking fool?

826
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,800
Not complete, sir.

827
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,800
And while I hesitate to tell your job.

828
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,200
I must point out that
when shipped separately,

829
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,160
the weapons and the aircraft

830
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,560
both comply with current Interpol

831
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,960
trade standards and practices.

832
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,240
We both know, that is an obscene

833
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,320
bureaucratic loophole that's gonna
be closed

834
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,840
any goddamn day.

835
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,560
But it's not closed.

836
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,160
And while certain people might interpret

837
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,920
this cargo as suspicious,

838
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,680
thank God we live in a world,
where suspicion alone

839
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,560
does not constitute a crime.

840
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,720
And men like you

841
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,520
respect the rule of law.

842
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,320
I was as guilty as sin,

843
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,320
but Valentine couldn't prove it.

844
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,760
And he was the rarest breed of
law enforcement officer,

845
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,480
the type who knew I was breaking the law,

846
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,280
but wouldn't break it himself to bust me.

847
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,640
TWO DAYS LATER

848
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,360
Valentine wasn't the only one trying to

849
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,560
put me out of business.

850
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,440
My uncle had turned down a half
dozen rival arms dealers,

851
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,920
sometimes with offers better than mine.

852
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,520
But to Dmitri, you couldn't put
a price on loyalty.

853
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,400
What was he doing here?

854
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,400
He is hoping to beat your offer.

855
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,800
I told him to go have intercourse
with himself.

856
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,080
But Yuri

857
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,680
You need to make more payoffs.

858
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,200
Too many know.
Don't worry.

859
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,840
There are more VCRs and cigarettes.

860
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,640
I left them in your new car.

861
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,840
Even your enemy was admiring that car.

862
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,680
I'm the luckiest man alive.

863
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,880
You are.

864
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:40,960
Hello.

865
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,800
Ava?

866
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,240
Hi, baby.

867
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,520
You forgot what time it is?

868
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,520
Sorry, I...

869
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,480
How was that your audition?

870
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,120
They're going in another direction.

871
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Direction with someone who can act.

872
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,880
They don't deserve you.

873
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,160
Where are you?

874
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,760
Is everything okay?

875
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,680
It was a rough day at the office.

876
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,760
Come home.

877
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Soon. How's Nicki?

878
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,920
He misses you. We both do.

879
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,880
It's lonely without you here.

880
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,280
You know I don't like nights.

881
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,640
Ever since my parents...

882
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,960
Yuri, what's that?

883
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,920
A party.

884
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,880
I'd better go.

885
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,840
Just wanted to call and hear your voice.

886
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,800
Kiss Nicki for me.

887
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,240
I love you.

888
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,800
The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.

889
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,000
After The Wall came down

890
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,280
$32 billion billion dollars worth of arms

891
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,240
were stolen and resold from
Ukraine alone,

892
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,680
one of the greatest heists of the
20th Century.

893
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,760
Monrovia, Liberia - 1995

894
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,600
The primary market was Africa.

895
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,320
Eleven major conflicts involving

896
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,560
thirty-two countries in less than a decade...

897
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,400
A gunrunner's wet dream.

898
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,520
At the time, the West couldn't care less.

899
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,720
They had a white war in what was
left of Yugoslavia.

900
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,000
I did the bulk of my business in Liberia...

901
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,280
"Land of the Free." Originally

902
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,160
established as a homeland for
freed American slaves,

903
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,720
it's been enslaved by one dictator

904
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,640
or another ever since.

905
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,200
The latest was American-educated,

906
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,320
self declared president, Andre Baptiste.

907
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,720
Mr. Yuri!

908
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm Andre Baptiste, Junior.

909
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,040
My father would like to meet you.

910
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,320
What an honor.

911
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:50,920
Thank him.

912
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,160
But unfortunately I have other business.

913
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,240
It's a shame, it's a very busy schedule.

914
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:07,360
It is not, as they say, optional.

915
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,560
My father is easily offended.

916
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,600
My schedule just freed up.

917
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,760
President Baptiste was my best customer

918
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,680
but I was in no hurry to meet him.

919
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,000
He'd gotten a reputation for
routinely hacking off the

920
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,120
limbs of those who opposed him.

921
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,640
His seven-year civil war has been
described...

922
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,560
as "a relentless campaign of
sadistic wanton violence."

923
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,920
That kind of sums up Andy for me.

924
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,480
The Glock is interesting.

925
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,440
It's made of a polymer composite.

926
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,800
Many of my clients feel they can
get through airport security

927
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,840
without setting off a lot of bells
and whistles.

928
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,840
Personally I do not recommend that.

929
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,440
On the other hand,

930
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,960
if you are looking for a traditional
wheel gun,

931
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,600
there is no substitute for the six inches

932
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,760
of muzzle energy of a.357 magnum.

933
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,920
And of course, it will never jam.

934
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,800
Why did you do that?

935
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,240
What did you say?

936
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,640
Now you'll have to buy it.

937
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,800
It's a used gun.

938
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,360
How can I sell a used gun?

939
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,160
A used gun.

940
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,760
A used gun.

941
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,880
That's a good one.

942
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,000
You know there is no discipline
with the youth today.

943
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,240
I try to set an example but it is
difficult, eh?

944
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,440
Personally, I blame MTV.

945
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,000
A used gun.

946
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,640
I think you and I, we can do business.

947
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,200
If I thought I was scared of
Andre Senior,

948
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,600
I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.

949
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,840
Like father, like son.

950
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,880
The guava doesn't fall too far
from the tree.

951
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,560
He was also a cannibal.

952
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,200
They say Andre would eat a victim's heart

953
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,800
while it was still beating

954
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,760
to give him superhuman strength.

955
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,200
Monrovia itself was like being on
another planet.

956
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,040
Planet Monrovia.

957
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:19,800
From the temperature,

958
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,400
it was obviously a planet close to
the sun.

959
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,120
I rarely saw another white man,

960
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,960
and I never left town alone.

961
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,240
Outside town was the edge of hell.

962
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,320
I didn't want to even gaze into it.

963
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,840
This is your hotel. Two stars.

964
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,200
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

965
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,200
Part one, two, or three?

966
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,520
I've only seen part one.

967
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,720
The M-60.

968
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,680
Would you like the armor-piercing
bullets?

969
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,080
Please.

970
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,320
My father left a welcoming
present in your room.

971
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,200
Enjoy.

972
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,640
My God, she nearly got her head cut off.

973
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,760
When I get to America,

974
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,280
I will not live in Brentwood.

975
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,640
Second floor.

976
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,960
In the most AIDS-infested region
of the globe...

977
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,080
where one in four is infected...

978
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,840
Andre's idea of a joke was to put

979
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,600
a young Iman and a young Naomi
in my bed.

980
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,200
And no condom within 100 miles.

981
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,640
Hello, Mr. Yuri.

982
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,200
Hi.

983
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,840
We'd be happy to make you happy.

984
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,720
Uh, I can't. I'd love to.

985
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,240
But I can't.

986
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,440
Don't worry.

987
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,520
We don't have anything.

988
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,600
How do you know?

989
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,880
Do we look like it?

990
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,680
What if I have AIDS?

991
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,200
Don't you worry?

992
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,920
You worry too much.

993
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,360
Why do you worry about
something that

994
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,680
can kill you in ten years

995
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,800
when there are so many things
that can kill you today?

996
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,440
Now...

997
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,280
...how can we make you happy?

998
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,160
By leaving.

999
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,040
These are my Kalashnikov Kids.

1000
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,080
My Boy Brigades.

1001
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,360
I can see what you are thinking,

1002
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,640
but we need every man we can get.

1003
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,640
Even if they're not men?

1004
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,440
A bullet from a fourteen-year-old...

1005
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,200
...is just as effective as one from
a forty-year-old.

1006
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,120
Often more effective.

1007
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,600
No one can stop this bath of blood.

1008
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,640
It's not "bath of blood."

1009
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,360
It's "bloodbath."

1010
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,640
Thank you.

1011
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,200
But I prefer it my way.

1012
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,560
I am not going to pay your asking price.

1013
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,600
We are not a rich people.
And besides,

1014
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,880
the market is already flooded with
your Kalashnikovs.

1015
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,640
Do you realize in some parts of
my country

1016
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,680
you can get one for the price of a chicken?

1017
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,400
But you can't just consider unit price.

1018
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,920
You forget ancillary costs.

1019
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,160
End-user certificates need to be
forged and notarized,

1020
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,320
Shell companies set up,

1021
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,440
insurance purchased,
pilots and crews hired.

1022
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,280
Not to mention bribes.

1023
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,480
You can't get a nut and bolt out

1024
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,320
of the Eastern Bloc without a bribe.

1025
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,680
There's one bribe for the nut,

1026
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,280
another for the bolt.

1027
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,440
Andy... Andy, listen to me.

1028
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,960
This is an expensive proposition.

1029
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,320
"Andy"?

1030
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:14,480
I am going to pay you in timber or stones.

1031
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,440
I'll take the stones.

1032
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,760
It's kind of hard to get a tree trunk
into my hand luggage.

1033
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,080
I know you're planning a new offensive.

1034
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,680
If you can delay a week,

1035
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,120
I can get you armored personnel carriers.

1036
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,720
They'd greatly reduce your casualties...

1037
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,840
...and give you a significant
strategic advantage.

1038
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,920
You know, they call me
the Lord Of War.

1039
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,240
But perhaps it is you.

1040
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,200
It's not "Lord Of War," it's "Warlord."

1041
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,840
Thank you, but I prefer it my way.

1042
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,400
Conflict diamonds are a common
currency in West Africa,

1043
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,400
also referred to as "blood diamonds"

1044
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,680
since bloodshed is what they
generally finance.

1045
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,160
By the late '90s, my wealth had caught up

1046
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,000
to my lies about my wealth.

1047
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,120
Even surpassed my lies.

1048
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,440
I could even afford to become a
patron of the arts.

1049
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,600
It's just that I can't believe it.

1050
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,520
Well, of... of course, it's wonderful.

1051
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,520
I just...

1052
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,440
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

1053
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,120
Yes. Well, that wou-that would be
great, too yeah.

1054
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,120
It's wonderful. Thank you so much.

1055
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,280
It's... Yuri. Okay, thank you. Bye.

1056
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,880
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.

1057
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,160
I just sold my first painting.

1058
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,480
Aah! That's fantastic.

1059
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,720
Uh, who bought it?

1060
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,040
It's someone important.

1061
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,720
They want to remain anonymous.

1062
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,000
This is so wonderful!
How was your trip?

1063
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,240
You know, same old, same old.

1064
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,080
Where's Nicki?

1065
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,720
Oh, in bed, I'm sorry.
He couldn't stay up.

1066
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,560
That's best.

1067
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,080
My first painting!

1068
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,080
I'm officially an artist!

1069
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,200
This calls for a drink.
What doesn't?

1070
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,360
Hi.

1071
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,360
Yuri, this is uh...

1072
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,440
Candy.

1073
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,600
Candy. Of course.

1074
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,760
Any friend of my brother's is a...

1075
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,280
friend of my brother's.

1076
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,720
You have a beautiful... everything.

1077
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,280
Yes, he does.

1078
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,640
Yes, I do.

1079
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,760
I'm going to kiss Nicki goodnight.

1080
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,040
Okay.

1081
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,400
How are you, brother?

1082
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,920
Well, you know,

1083
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,440
still the resident family fuckup.

1084
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,240
Yeah. Well, I guess someone has
to do it.

1085
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,440
Well.

1086
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,920
Hey, Ava knows, right?

1087
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,240
I never want to say anything,

1088
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,040
She doesn't have to know.

1089
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,520
She understands.

1090
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,760
She's a survivor, like me.

1091
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,840
She may be a survivor,

1092
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,600
but she's not like you.

1093
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,600
Really She doesn't know
how you pay for all this

1094
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,640
We don't talk about it.

1095
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,280
How many car salesman talk
about their work? Huh?

1096
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,400
How many cigarette salesmen?

1097
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,960
Both their products kill more people

1098
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:02,800
every year than mine.

1099
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,120
At least mine has a safety switch.

1100
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,920
If those guys can leave their work
at the office,

1101
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,520
so can I.

1102
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,760
God damn, you are good!

1103
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,800
You really are.

1104
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,160
You almost had me convinced.

1105
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,800
Could you...

1106
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,000
could you help me out with...

1107
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,520
Why?

1108
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,520
Why?

1109
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,160
Why?

1110
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,960
Why what?

1111
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,000
Why?

1112
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:54,800
Why?
I don't know.

1113
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,240
Why...
I don't know.

1114
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,520
Why what?

1115
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,280
Why're you so fucked up all the time?

1116
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,840
Because I am. I don't know.

1117
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,080
I didn't know how much Ava
really knew...

1118
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,360
and how much she ignored.

1119
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,680
She never questioned how a guy

1120
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,880
in the transport business...

1121
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,200
could afford to give her 18 carat
diamond earrings.

1122
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,360
I guess she didn't want to hear the answer.

1123
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,720
Mostly, She seemed content

1124
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,160
that I was a good provider...

1125
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,240
and as far as she was concerned, loyal.

1126
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,480
Despite the other women...

1127
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,960
I always made love to Ava

1128
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,080
as if she was the only one.

1129
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,360
I'm not saying I didn't have setbacks.

1130
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,480
It's not called gunrunning for nothing.

1131
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,160
You gotta be fast on your feet.

1132
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,400
Some revolutions blow over
the guns even get there.

1133
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,560
There's nothing's more expensive

1134
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,360
for an arms dealer than peace.

1135
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,600
Truce? What do you mean, truce?

1136
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,520
The guns are already on their way.

1137
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,320
Peace talks.

1138
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,160
All right, forget it.

1139
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,520
I'll re-route the shipment to the Balkans.

1140
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,000
When they talk about war,

1141
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,720
they keep their word.

1142
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,600
Of course, a new breed of gunrunner

1143
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,840
requires a new breed of cop.

1144
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,280
Henry, take Park Avenue.

1145
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,600
Take 'em on a tour of New Jersey.

1146
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,840
Yuri, there are men going through
our garbage cans.

1147
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,280
Well, it's probably just some reporters

1148
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,840
looking for somebody else.

1149
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,360
I have a feeling they don't work
for the tabloids.

1150
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,520
Yuri...

1151
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,040
is there anything I should be
worried about?

1152
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,360
No, nothing.

1153
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,680
Nothing?

1154
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,920
I love you.

1155
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,360
I love you, too.

1156
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,920
Sir.

1157
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,120
I was now the best merchant
of death alive.

1158
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,800
I didn't own my own plane,
I owned a fleet.

1159
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,760
Running guns into Liberia,
Sierra Leone,

1160
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,400
or the Ivory Coast at least once a week.

1161
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,800
Most trips I had phony paperwork.

1162
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:50,840
The deadline was tight

1163
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,120
and I had to cut corners,

1164
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,480
I had no paperwork at all.

1165
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,160
But I wasn't overly concerned.

1166
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,360
There was hardly any radar over
most of Africa

1167
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,440
and even fewer people to watch it.

1168
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,240
Charlie Echo India,

1169
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,000
...re-route to Kabala airport...

1170
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,080
...on heading zero-two nine.

1171
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,760
Comply immediately.

1172
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,680
Yuri, what the fuck is going on?

1173
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,040
Hello, Southern? It's Yuri.

1174
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,160
I Sorry to call you on this number.

1175
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,920
But I've got Interpol's all over my ass.

1176
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,480
I can't know you right now.

1177
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,760
It's uh, not a good time.

1178
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,760
Not a good time?

1179
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,440
Motherfucker!

1180
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,200
Charlie, Echo, India,
comply immediately.

1181
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,760
This is your last warning.

1182
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Where was the first fucking warning?

1183
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,920
Rock your wings
if you intend to comply

1184
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,360
I'm putting us down.

1185
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,600
If you land, we're going away.

1186
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,600
I don't have paperwork.

1187
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,800
We're in a flying fucking bomb!

1188
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,520
They're firing bullets at our bullets.

1189
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,080
I'm putting us down.

1190
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,440
Okay, okay. Fuck!

1191
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,320
This is Charlie, Echo, India.

1192
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,400
Request re-route to Kabala airport,

1193
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,240
bearing zero-two-nine.

1194
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,960
No, not the airport. There the highway.

1195
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,160
It's our only hope.

1196
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,680
Are you fucking mad?

1197
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,480
A pothole will set us off.

1198
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,400
You underestimate yourself, Alexei.

1199
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,360
You're the best.

1200
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,920
You're the shit, Alexei, you're the shit!

1201
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,040
You're the shit! You're the shit!

1202
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,760
Of course Alexei wasn't the best.

1203
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,440
He'd come forty-second out of
forty three

1204
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,880
at the Moscow Flight School.

1205
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,680
Oh, God, what's he doing?

1206
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,080
Is this guy nuts?

1207
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,000
I can't land there, sir.

1208
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,600
Kabala's fifteen minutes away.

1209
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,840
He can't get far.

1210
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,440
I want a truck on the tarmac.

1211
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,840
We gonna be okay.

1212
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,080
Where are you going?

1213
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,960
As far from the evidence as we can get.

1214
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,960
Wait, there's not going to be any evidence!

1215
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,720
Come here. Come here.

1216
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,800
Hey, don't be shy. Here, look.

1217
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:40,680
Free sample

1218
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,320
help yourself, okay? Free sample.

1219
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,600
Tell your friend.

1220
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,520
Gun for you.

1221
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,680
Happy times. Come on.

1222
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,200
Help yourselves. No charge.

1223
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,440
Everything goes.

1224
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,480
Guns, guns, guns, yes,
come on up!

1225
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,720
Here! You're having fun now, huh?

1226
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,760
Come on! Guns, guns, guns! Yes!

1227
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,400
Bullets, guns, grenades!

1228
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,480
Take 'em all.

1229
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,360
Take the whole crate. Go ahead.

1230
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,360
Gun, grenades, hooray!

1231
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,520
Bullets! Guns! Grenades!

1232
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,280
Yeah.

1233
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,680
That one's got your name on it.

1234
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,320
You want one, too? Come on.

1235
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,840
Don't forget the bullets.

1236
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,160
Don't forget the bullets.

1237
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,560
How can you shoot a gun
if you don't have bullets?

1238
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,920
Everything goes for free!

1239
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,400
Guns, grenades! All you see. Bullets,

1240
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,280
guns, grenades.

1241
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,960
Hooray, hooray!

1242
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,080
Have the bullets.

1243
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,000
What a cargo crew at Heathrow Airport

1244
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,040
does in a day took a bunch of

1245
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,520
malnourished Sierra Leonean
locals ten minutes.

1246
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,320
By the time Agent Valentine got there,

1247
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,480
you could find more guns on
a plane full of Quakers.

1248
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,760
Yuri Orlov.

1249
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,760
Ow! Fuck!

1250
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,120
You run from us?

1251
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,880
No, Mbizi. No!

1252
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,560
Can you run with no legs?

1253
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,920
Let me make him disappear,
Mr. Valentine

1254
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,760
Around here, people disappear all the time.

1255
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,920
I can't do that.

1256
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,400
Look where we are. Who will know?

1257
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,080
We will.

1258
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,280
He's gonna get what's coming to him.

1259
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,080
I'm not as certain.

1260
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,520
All right, get up.

1261
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:44,560
What's the charge?

1262
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,640
What are you doing in Sierra Leone...

1263
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,120
I'm on safari.

1264
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,400
Yeah? You're hunting wildebeests

1265
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,560
with a submachine gun?

1266
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,480
Do you also work with the
Park Service?

1267
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,600
Hunting without a license,
is that the charge?

1268
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,560
Why are we playing games?

1269
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,080
You traffic arms.

1270
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:00,680
Trade.

1271
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:01,360
Trade.

1272
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,840
Traffic.

1273
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,520
You get rich by giving the
poorest people on the planet

1274
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,200
the means to continue killing each other.

1275
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,000
Do you know why I do what I do?

1276
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,880
I mean, there are more
prestigious assignments.

1277
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,640
Keeping track of nuclear arsenals,

1278
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,840
You'd think that's more critical to
world security,

1279
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,760
but it's not.

1280
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,840
No, nine out of ten war victims today

1281
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,400
are killed with assault rifles and
small like yours.

1282
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,400
Those nuclear missiles?

1283
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,000
They sit in their silos. Your AK-47?

1284
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,920
That is the real weapon of mass
destruction.

1285
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,760
I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.

1286
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,080
I don't put a gun to anybody's head

1287
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,760
and make them shoot.

1288
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,280
I admit, but shooting war is better
for business,

1289
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,800
but I prefer people to
fire my guns and miss.

1290
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,520
Just as long as they're firing.

1291
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,000
Can I go now?

1292
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:56,280
You've got nothing on me.
Except cuffs.

1293
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,560
Since you're so concerned with the law,

1294
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,120
you must know that I'm legally

1295
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,160
permitted to hold you for
twenty- four hours

1296
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,640
without charging you.

1297
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,720
You might ask why I would do
that and I can assure you.

1298
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,160
It's not because I enjoy your
company,

1299
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,680
because I don't.

1300
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,760
No, the reason why

1301
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,720
I'll delay you for every second

1302
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,680
of the permissible twenty-four hours

1303
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,080
Is I'm delaying your deadly trade

1304
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,880
and the deaths of your victims.

1305
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,720
I don't think of it as taking a day from you...

1306
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,600
...but giving a day to them.

1307
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,760
Some innocent man, woman, or child

1308
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,880
is going to have an extra day

1309
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,120
on this earth because you're not free.

1310
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:38,440
So, I will see you in twenty-three hours

1311
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,280
and fifty-five minutes, hm?

1312
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,720
Valentine knew he didn't have to guard me.

1313
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,480
There was nowhere to go.

1314
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,480
Or maybe he was hoping the locals

1315
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,440
would tear me apart.

1316
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,120
But they were too busy with the plane.

1317
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,280
It's like parking your car

1318
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,000
in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.

1319
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,800
You just don't do it.

1320
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,720
The way I looked at it

1321
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,240
it's the way of Africa, maybe life.

1322
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,040
Everything that comes from the earth

1323
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,960
eventually returns.

1324
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,640
Even a 40-ton Atonov-12 cargo plane.

1325
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,320
A gift. For you.

1326
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,720
You know, you've arrived just in time.

1327
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,840
I was afraid that he might die

1328
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,520
before you got your chance to kill him.

1329
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:46,280
This man came here hoping to
take your place.

1330
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,400
Is that not so?

1331
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,480
No, I'm not here to supply
Mr. Baptiste.

1332
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,040
I am here to supply his enemies.

1333
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,600
I fear it's a sale I shall never complete.

1334
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:21,200
He killed your blood... Your uncle...

1335
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,240
when he tried to kill you.

1336
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,960
No.

1337
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,280
No?

1338
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,840
You want that I should let him go?

1339
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,600
"No. I..."

1340
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,680
You do want him dead.

1341
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,800
You just... don't want

1342
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,240
to have to do it yourself.

1343
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,360
So.

1344
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,400
We will do this together.

1345
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:15,320
This will be a bonding experience.

1346
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,520
You know you can stop this
any time that you want.

1347
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,720
But I don't think that you do.

1348
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,320
Just say the word.

1349
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,640
Say it. "Stop."

1350
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,160
Stop.

1351
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,440
I will get you another room,
my friend.

1352
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,880
With a much nicer view.

1353
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,480
He ordered you brown-brown,
Mr. Yuri.

1354
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,440
What?

1355
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,240
Brown-brown.

1356
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,680
What is it?

1357
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,880
A mixture of cocaine...

1358
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,360
...and gunpowder.

1359
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,160
They give it to the young boys
before they do battle.

1360
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,920
They'll do anything!

1361
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,280
Some other time.

1362
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,480
I suggest you try it,
at least once, Mr. Yuri.

1363
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,960
Why?

1364
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,080
'Cause it's your gunpowder.

1365
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,360
Even before that night,

1366
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,520
I'd started doing a lot of cocaine
in West Africa.

1367
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,960
I'd never tried brown-brown before,

1368
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,440
but then I'd never killed a man, either.

1369
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,760
Oh.

1370
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,840
Oh, I didn't do anything, did I?

1371
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,480
I didn't do anything, did I?

1372
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,560
You didn't do much.

1373
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,160
Wait. Are you sick?

1374
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,120
SIDA? AIDS?

1375
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,720
Ask the white man. He will know.

1376
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,480
Sir, will my hand grow back?

1377
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:27,520
Simeon.

1378
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,800
Remember, Yuri, take sides.

1379
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,600
Simeon!

1380
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,640
Don't! He's Andre's.
Fuck Andre!

1381
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,360
Fuck Andre!

1382
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,320
I'm sorry they don't usually do that.

1383
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,360
Let me look it. Maybe I can fix it.

1384
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,840
Let me see it. It's the magazine.

1385
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,320
Give it to me.

1386
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,320
Fuck you!

1387
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,360
I started to feel I'd been cursed.

1388
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,000
...the curse of invincibility.

1389
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,000
Nicki, please, go to your room.

1390
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,280
I don't believe you.

1391
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,720
Can you prove any of this?

1392
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,440
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble

1393
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,600
to make his business look legitimate.

1394
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:48,840
Even to you.

1395
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,480
Perhaps especially to you.

1396
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,320
I don't expect we'll find anything here today.

1397
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,000
So what do you want?

1398
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,520
I was hoping that you would help me.

1399
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,680
I understand that uh...

1400
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,560
your parents died tragically?

1401
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,400
The illegal firearms used to murder
your mother and father

1402
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,880
were procured from men exactly
like your husband.

1403
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,640
I'd like you to leave.

1404
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,920
Okay. Gentlemen.

1405
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,040
Ava?

1406
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,440
Ava, what's wrong?

1407
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,600
I can't wear the clothes.

1408
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,200
Can't wear the jewelry.

1409
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,600
Can't drive the car.

1410
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,800
Can't live in this house.

1411
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,680
Everything's got blood on it.

1412
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,360
Blood on it?

1413
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,160
What's the matter with you?

1414
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,680
Don't be so melodramatic.

1415
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:25,880
I'm melodramatic.

1416
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,200
I'm a failed actress, remember?

1417
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,240
I told you, these people, it's political.

1418
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,240
They lie. They're liars.

1419
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,000
Look at me. They lie to make

1420
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,200
themselves look good, okay?

1421
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,040
You can't trust them.

1422
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,960
It's not just them.

1423
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,840
Don't worry. Your family didn't
say anything.

1424
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,640
They didn't have to.

1425
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:01,840
I sell people a means to defend
themselves. Ava.

1426
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:02,800
That's all.

1427
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,800
Yuri, I see the news. I see those pictures.

1428
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,960
The guns are bigger than the boys!

1429
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,560
There is nothing illegal
about what I do!

1430
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,160
I don't care if it's legal!

1431
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,760
It's wrong!

1432
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,600
Please, stop.

1433
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,120
It makes no difference if I stop.

1434
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,080
Someone will take my place the next day.

1435
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,560
So let them. We have enough.

1436
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,640
It's not about the money.

1437
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,880
Then what is it?

1438
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,400
I'm good at it.

1439
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:12,160
I feel like all I've done my whole life
is be pretty.

1440
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:17,000
I mean all I've done is be born.

1441
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:21,880
I'm a failed actress, a failed artist.

1442
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,800
I'm not much good as a mother.

1443
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,360
I'm not even that pretty anymore.

1444
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:36,360
I have failed at everything, Yuri.

1445
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,160
But I won't fail as a human being.

1446
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,440
My enemies had finally found a weapon

1447
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,200
that could hurt me.

1448
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:50,640
For the next six months,

1449
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,000
I stopped running guns.

1450
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:52,920
I went legitimate.

1451
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,600
This is an untapped market.

1452
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,240
I'm talking over five million
cubic meters of timber

1453
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,440
in the first year alone.

1454
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,680
Over 100 exploitable species.

1455
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:01,720
The oil?

1456
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,920
Between you and me, this...

1457
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,080
Ten thousand barrels a month?

1458
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,800
He must be lying. He's talking!

1459
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,960
Listen, there are gas reserves off the

1460
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,160
Ivory Coast that OPEC doesn't
even know about.

1461
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,160
The phone numbers all check out.

1462
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,840
It's all on the level.

1463
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,320
No wonder Valentine was confused.

1464
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,840
Thank God there are still legal ways

1465
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,200
to exploit developing countries.

1466
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,400
The only problem with an honest buck

1467
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,160
is they're so hard to make.

1468
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,640
The margins are too low.

1469
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,640
Too many people are doing it.

1470
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,800
Still, I'd promised Ava.

1471
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:05,040
Yuri, the President of Liberia
is on his way up.

1472
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,400
He's early.

1473
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,800
I'll be back in a minute.

1474
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,560
What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?

1475
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,520
We are here for peace talks at the
United Nations.

1476
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,320
So at the same time you thought

1477
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,800
you'd drop in on your arms dealer?

1478
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:24,920
Well, I was beginning to wonder

1479
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,280
whether that was still your profession.

1480
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,040
You know, you're a hard man

1481
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,560
to get a hold of all of Sudden.

1482
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,240
That is a shame.

1483
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,840
My son and I were hoping to do
a little shopping.

1484
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,120
While in New York.

1485
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,160
You know they're watching you.

1486
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:39,840
Yes, I know they blame me.

1487
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,360
They blame me for everything,
those hypocrites.

1488
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,240
There're hunt for a witch.

1489
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,600
Witch hunt.

1490
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,080
Hostilities have escalated.

1491
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,360
And they are making it very
difficult for me to re-supply.

1492
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:57,000
That requires a man of your rare ingenuity.

1493
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,520
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

1494
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,440
I understand.

1495
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,960
But you should know this:

1496
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,360
Due to our present situation

1497
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,760
we are compelled to be unusually generous.

1498
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,640
So, see you soon, Lord of War.

1499
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:33,640
You still haven't brought me
the gun of Rambo.

1500
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,640
At four and a half months old...

1501
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,520
a human fetus has a reptile's tail...

1502
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,520
a remnant of our evolution.

1503
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,560
Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.

1504
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,920
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive,

1505
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,840
but if you fight your biology,

1506
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,000
you always lose.

1507
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,400
You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?

1508
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,800
I'm not leaving for another ten minutes.

1509
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,920
Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.

1510
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:10,800
You know, I'm kind of glad you're going.

1511
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:11,560
You've been here so long

1512
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,600
you're starting to get on my nerves.

1513
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,680
This oil concession should be
wrapped up by Thursday.

1514
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,000
I'll be back for the weekend.

1515
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,080
We'll go somewhere.

1516
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,120
The sea.

1517
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,600
That would be fun.

1518
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:21,960
Come on.

1519
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,440
Hey. You trust me, right?

1520
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,560
She looked me directly in the eye...

1521
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,520
the way I've looked in the eyes

1522
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,240
of a thousand customs officials...

1523
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,000
government bureaucrats and
law enforcement agents.

1524
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,200
Yes, I trust you.

1525
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,320
And she lied without flinching.

1526
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,360
I'll see you, big guy.

1527
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,160
Bye Papa.

1528
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,840
She learned from the best.

1529
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,240
Have a good trip.

1530
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,000
That's him.

1531
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,240
Where are we going, Mama?

1532
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,480
It's a game, honey.

1533
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,960
Like hide and seek?

1534
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,240
Yes.

1535
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,520
Like hide and seek.

1536
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,240
I can always sense
when I'm being tailed.

1537
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,040
I know what to look for.

1538
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,960
But then I'd never been tailed
by the woman I love.

1539
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,240
I can put myself in Ava's place.

1540
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:14,800
She might've understood if the combination

1541
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,200
was the last four digits of my
social security number...

1542
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,640
my birth date, even her birth date,

1543
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,360
but not Nicolai's.

1544
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,160
My son's birthday unlocked

1545
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,360
what the government would
later describe...

1546
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,720
...as "a catalogue of carnage."

1547
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,200
Nicki, stay right there.

1548
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,240
Come on, Nicki.

1549
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,480
Come to see how the other half lives?

1550
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,320
I miss your borscht.

1551
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,600
Mom and Dad say you're clean.

1552
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,080
Yeah, you, too.

1553
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,880
You went legit, huh?

1554
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,000
That's hard to believe.

1555
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,840
That's because it's not true.

1556
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:22,680
Only you know.

1557
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,560
I'm leaving tonight on a job

1558
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,200
I want you to come.

1559
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:31,840
I can't. I've got a girlfriend.

1560
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,480
I think she might be the one.

1561
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:37,520
Plus, I'm thinking of opening
my own place.

1562
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,200
Maybe this trip will help.

1563
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,720
It's good money.

1564
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:47,080
Yuri, I've given my word.

1565
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,800
No one has to know.

1566
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,200
Tell them we going for a little R and R.

1567
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,840
What do you need me for,
all of sudden?

1568
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,840
West Africa's fucked up.

1569
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:59,760
More than usual.

1570
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,440
I can't trust anybody.

1571
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,440
I need you to watch my back.

1572
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:12,200
Brothers in arms.

1573
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:28,040
Monrovia, Liberia - 2001

1574
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:48,440
Yuri! Welcome back.

1575
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,200
Welcome both of you.

1576
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,040
Welcome to democracy.

1577
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,040
Democracy?

1578
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,480
What have you been drinking, Andy?

1579
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,480
Huh, you have not seen the news.

1580
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,800
You know they accuse me of
rigging elections.

1581
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:05,040
But after this, with your Florida and
you Supreme Court of Kangaroos,

1582
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,840
Now, the U.S. Must shut up forever.

1583
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,240
How do you do this, Yuri?

1584
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,200
How do you do this,

1585
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,520
when they are watching all of
my airspace?

1586
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:22,280
Where there's a will,
there's a weapon.

1587
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,520
Come on, where's my fucking money?

1588
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,640
When it is delivered.

1589
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,320
It is delivered.

1590
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,040
This is not for me.

1591
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,320
This is for my neighbors to the west.

1592
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,520
The west?

1593
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,480
We're going to Sierra Leone.

1594
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:45,560
Oh, yes. And my son Baptiste Junior

1595
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,960
will go with you to make the
proper introductions.

1596
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,960
We have no trucks.

1597
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,200
You will.

1598
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,480
As soon as we get the food out of them.

1599
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,800
Gun of Rambo.

1600
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:05,400
Mr. Yuri, you're a man of your word.

1601
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,120
So where are we going?

1602
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,880
RUF - the Freedom Fighters.

1603
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:14,880
Every faction in Africa calls
themselves by the noble names.

1604
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,760
Liberation-this Patriotic-that,

1605
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,520
Democratic Republic
of-something-or-other.

1606
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,320
I guess they can't own up to
what they usually are

1607
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,840
Federation of Worse Oppressors
than the Last Bunch of Oppressors.

1608
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,120
Often, the most barbaric atrocities occur

1609
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:40,840
when both combatants proclaim
themselves "freedom fighters."

1610
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:50,080
Right, I've got 500 units, brand new
right out of the box,

1611
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,920
all as clean as this. What have you got?

1612
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:12,240
God! Oh, Jesus.

1613
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,520
God! Oh, Jesus.

1614
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:22,600
Yuri, I need to talk to you.

1615
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:23,760
Not now.

1616
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,000
Now.

1617
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,120
Excuse me.

1618
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,520
What?

1619
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,800
We can't do this deal.
The fuck we can't!

1620
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:40,720
What's the matter with you?

1621
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,280
Look, over there.

1622
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,160
As soon as we hand over the guns
those people are going to die!

1623
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,480
It's not our business.

1624
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:54,120
They killed a boy just now
as young as Nicki.

1625
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:59,520
What is the holdup?

1626
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,400
There is no holdup.

1627
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,120
I'll be right there.

1628
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,680
Vitaly, it's what we always know:

1629
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:04,800
We can't control what they do.

1630
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,800
No, no, today we can. Today we can.

1631
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,400
Yuri, they're right there!

1632
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:10,600
What do you think they'll do to us

1633
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,800
if we back out? They'll kill us.

1634
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:15,400
And if we go ahead, what do you
think they'll do to them?

1635
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:21,400
We've got to do something.

1636
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,240
Please, for fuck's sake.

1637
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,520
It's not our fight.

1638
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,120
Please. Brothers in arms.

1639
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,120
What is he saying?

1640
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,320
It's the deal.

1641
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,640
My brother's not happy with the terms.

1642
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,440
We'll work it out. It's nothing.

1643
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,200
Right? It's nothing.

1644
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:56,040
Yeah. Nothing.

1645
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,000
You're right. Yuri, you're right.

1646
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,240
God, I've got to get my shit together.

1647
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,800
This is not our fight.

1648
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,000
Right.

1649
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,640
Okay. What's the deal?

1650
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:14,120
300 RPGs, 500 assault rifles
and 800 grenades.

1651
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,840
I thought it was 1200 grenades.

1652
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,760
I was so caught up in the deal...

1653
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,320
I never realized
what was going on in Vitaly's head.

1654
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,800
I thought it was 1200 grenades.

1655
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,040
Confused.

1656
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:29,880
Come to think about it,

1657
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:33,280
maybe I never understood what
was going on in his head.

1658
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:38,600
I beg your pardon.

1659
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,240
May I see another stone?

1660
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:43,000
One thing I do understand
for certain...

1661
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:46,200
...is that Vitaly broke the
cardinal rule of gunrunning.

1662
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:49,360
Never pick up a gun and join
the customers.

1663
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:57,480
What are you doing?

1664
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,600
Something for Yuri.

1665
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,680
Step away. Slow.

1666
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,680
No, Vit!

1667
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:29,000
No! Vit!

1668
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,040
Only half the guns were gone...

1669
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,040
so I was still entitled to half the diamonds.

1670
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,520
If I took them, I was lost.

1671
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:01,000
If I left them, I was lost.

1672
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:11,960
The massacre played out exactly
how Vitaly predicted.

1673
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:13,640
But then, a half-dozen
other massacres

1674
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:16,240
happened in Sierra Leone that week.

1675
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:17,840
You can't stop them all.

1676
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,040
In my experience,
you can't stop any of them.

1677
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:25,920
They say evil prevails
when good men fail to act.

1678
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:30,080
What they ought to say is,
evil prevails.

1679
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:44,720
I now shared even more in common...

1680
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,280
with the leader of that country God
seemed to have forsaken.

1681
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:51,400
We saw something in each other
that neither of us liked.

1682
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:54,480
Or maybe we were just looking
in the mirror.

1683
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,240
I paid a Monrovian doctor
twenty dollars

1684
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,200
to remove the lead from
Vitaly's body

1685
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,200
and write a bogus death certificate.

1686
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,000
I should've paid more.

1687
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,080
I've smuggled millions of
rounds of ammunition,

1688
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,920
and the bullet that lands me in jail...

1689
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,640
is found under my dead brother's rib.

1690
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,840
Yuri Orlov.

1691
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:34,800
We're with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms.

1692
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:35,680
Let me guess.

1693
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,480
This is not about the alcohol or
the tobacco.

1694
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:19,640
Crimean Restaurant.

1695
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,160
Papa?

1696
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,560
Both my sons are dead.

1697
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:35,760
There are only two tragedies in life.

1698
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,000
One is not getting what you want.

1699
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:39,400
The other is getting it.

1700
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:40,400
Is this one of yours?

1701
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:43,320
Jack Valentine finally had
what he wanted.

1702
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:48,040
Curiously, the death certificate says
he died of heart failure.

1703
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,960
Falsifying a death certificate?

1704
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,880
That's not gonna hold me.

1705
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:56,520
You're right. As usual, you are right.

1706
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,160
Have you seen today's paper? Huh?

1707
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:09,560
Fake end-user certificates.

1708
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:12,800
Cut-out companies,
meticulously catalogued.

1709
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:16,800
There is hardly a warlord, dictator,
despot anywhere in the world

1710
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,000
that you're a first-name basis with.

1711
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:24,240
It was your wife your trophy wife
that led us to the prize.

1712
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:25,600
It's not her fault.

1713
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,080
She's just easier to follow
than you are.

1714
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,320
May I?

1715
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:33,000
Yeah, go ahead.

1716
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,880
Enjoy it.

1717
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,520
What? This.

1718
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:03,320
Tell me I'm everything you despise.

1719
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,880
That I'm the personification of evil.

1720
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:06,960
What?

1721
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:11,640
Responsible for the breakdown of
the fabric of society and world order.

1722
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:14,200
I'm a one-man genocide.

1723
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,320
Say everything you want to say
to me now.

1724
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,800
Because you don't have long.

1725
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,640
Are you paying attention?

1726
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,760
Or are you delusional?

1727
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,120
You have broken every arms
embargo written.

1728
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:31,360
There is enough here to put you away
for consecutive life sentences.

1729
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,080
You are going to spend
the next ten years of your life

1730
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:36,400
going from a cell to a courtroom
before you even start

1731
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:38,120
serving your time.

1732
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,880
I don't think you fully
appreciate the seriousness...

1733
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:44,760
...of your situation.

1734
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:57,280
My family has disowned me.

1735
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,360
My wife and son have left me.

1736
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,600
My brother's dead.

1737
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:07,760
Trust me.

1738
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,440
I fully appreciate the seriousness
of my situation.

1739
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:13,560
But I promise you,

1740
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,560
I won't spend a single second
in a courtroom.

1741
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:18,880
You are delusional.

1742
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:20,960
I like you, Jack.

1743
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:25,720
Well, maybe not,
but I understand you.

1744
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,120
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1745
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,320
This way, you can prepare yourself.

1746
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:39,680
Okay.

1747
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,400
Soon there's going to be
a knock on that door

1748
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:42,960
and you will be called outside.

1749
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,480
In the hall there will be
a man who outranks you.

1750
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:48,640
First, he'll compliment you on the
fine job you've done

1751
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,760
that you're making the world
a safer place

1752
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,240
that you're to receive
a commendation and a promotion.

1753
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:58,000
And then he'll tell you that
I am to be released.

1754
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:00,040
You're gonna protest.

1755
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:03,240
You'll probably threaten to resign.

1756
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,120
But in the end, I will be released.

1757
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,600
The reason I'll be released
is the same reason you think...

1758
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:10,680
I'll be convicted.

1759
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:13,480
I do rub shoulders with some of
the most vile,

1760
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,760
sadistic men calling themselves
leaders today.

1761
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:24,000
But some of those men are
the enemies of your enemies.

1762
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,800
And while the biggest arms dealer
in the world is your boss...

1763
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,760
...the President of the United States,

1764
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,520
who ships more merchandise in a day

1765
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,960
I do in a year...

1766
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:39,760
sometimes it's embarrassing to have
his fingerprints on the guns.

1767
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:42,680
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me

1768
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:43,800
to supply forces

1769
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:51,960
he can't be seen supplying.
So... you call me evil,

1770
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:56,840
but unfortunately for you,
I'm a necessary evil.

1771
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,440
I would tell you to go to hell.

1772
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,520
But I think you're already there.

1773
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,680
Pleasure doing business with you.

1774
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:55,200
Most people are happy
just to get out of jail.

1775
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,760
I expect to be paid to leave.

1776
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:58,920
I'm not a fool.

1777
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,840
I know that just because they
needed me that day

1778
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,840
didn't mean they wouldn't make
me a scapegoat the next.

1779
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,520
But I was back,

1780
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,600
doing what I do best.

1781
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,400
Umbrellas to the Sahara?

1782
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,200
Sun umbrellas.

1783
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,600
You know who's going to
inherit the Earth?

1784
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,200
Arms dealers.

1785
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:36,520
Because everyone else
is too busy killing each other.

1786
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,720
That's the secret to survival.

1787
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,400
Never go to war.

1788
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:45,680
Especially with yourself.
