00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,900
Where's Manny?

3
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Tell him the ice cream man is here.

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,100
Freeze. Hammer time.

5
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,700
Can we get down to business?

6
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,500
You got the money?

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Tell him.

8
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,000
He said that
he's not gonna give you one red cent...

9
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,400
until you tell him
what flavor the ice cream is.

10
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,800
Vanilla. That's what you ordered.

11
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,000
-Tell him.
-Okay.

12
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,000
lt's all about the Benjamins, baby!

13
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
Bring in the stuff.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,400
-Arnold Schwarzenegger, funny man!
-He's funny like that!

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,900
There is your ice cream.

16
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,000
Tell him. l see coming. He say....

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
<i>l tell him, l say Jesús.</i>

18
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,500
He coming, and he say....

19
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,800
-Tell him.
-He say...

20
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
FBl. You're under arrest.

21
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,200
-He's going to run.
-No, he ain't.

22
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
You owe me $1 .

23
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
Where are you going, big boy?

24
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,200
Goddamn. Now l'm going to bust your ass.

25
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,300
ls that all your big ass got?

26
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,200
-Enough.
-Kevin.

27
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,600
All right, you two over here. Right now.

28
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,700
l swear l'll shoot both of you.

29
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,200
Damn, Marcus, why you always
got to pick the biggest dude?

30
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,800
l don't know. l like a challenge.

31
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,400
See, what did l tell you?

32
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,200
We did it, right? Didn't l tell you?

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,000
-No help. No backup.
-You the man.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We'll get all the credit.
The biggest bust of our career.

35
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,800
400 keys of pure....

36
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
-Vanilla ice cream?
-What?

37
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,800
My man! Where's the drugs?

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,300
l know nothing about drugs.

39
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,300
l sell ice cream. Strawberry. Vanilla.

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,900
Neapolitan, for example.

41
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Tell Manny his ice cream delivery is here.

42
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,900
Never mind. Wrong store.

43
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,900
FBl. Freeze!

44
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,400
-Marcus?
-l'm good.

45
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,700
-They're moving.
-Let's go.

46
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,300
-Which one?
-l don't know.

47
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,900
-God.
-Damn.

48
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
l told you we should've called for backup.

49
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,100
You know the Chief's gonna kill us, right?

50
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,000
You know the Chief's gonna kill us, right?

51
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,600
Let me give you guys a little tip.

52
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,500
lf you're going to
operate outside the channels...

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,400
do the whole renegade cop thing...

54
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,800
you might want to make sure
that you get the right guy.

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
Chief, we almost had the guy.

56
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Our intelligence was just a little off.

57
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,800
Wait a minute. lntelligence?

58
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,400
Look around you, Copeland.
There's nothing intelligent about this.

59
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,800
Now l'm tired of your escapades.
l want them to stop.

60
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,700
The last thing l need is
to be the laughingstock of the Bureau.

61
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,300
And furthermore, the--

62
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,500
Hold on. Hello? Baby, l can't talk.

63
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,700
The Chief is chewing my ass right now.
l got to call you back. Bye.

64
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
-Sorry, Chief.
-As l was saying--

65
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,000
Gordon here.

66
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,900
Yes, he is.

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
-lt's for you.
-Thank you.

68
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,700
-Baby, l'm still with the Chief.
-No respect.

69
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,700
No, he's really not happy now.

70
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,400
Okay, l got to go. Bye. Thanks, Chief.

71
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,800
You guys are.... Get this place cleaned up.

72
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,100
l expect to have a full report
on my desk tomorrow.

73
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
-Yes, sir.
-And in the meantime...

74
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,100
l'm checking with the Bureau
to see if they got any openings...

75
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,100
in lraq.

76
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,900
The Dynamic Duo strikes again.
Way to go, Baskin and Robbin.

77
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Or is it Häag and Dazs?

78
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,800
Häag and Dazs. You wrote that?

79
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,700
That's good, l like that.

80
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,500
<i>-Later, Häag.
-Adiós, Dazs.</i>

81
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,000
-l hate those guys, dude.
-Oh, God.

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,500
All right.
Well, let's get this place cleaned up.

83
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,000
-All right.
-Okay, so, you do the floor.

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,900
Clean all the ice cream up
and l'll go warm the car up.

85
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,800
Okay. So much for a hot meal.

86
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,700
-Hey, baby.
-Don't ''hey, baby'' me.

87
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,000
l can't believe you have me
sitting here all night worried about you.

88
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,700
All night? Baby...

89
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,600
it's only 8:00.

90
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,400
Look, after work, me and Kevin went
down to the bar and had a couple of drinks.

91
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,100
l know. l called the bar.
They said you left at 7:45.

92
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,400
l checked MapQuest. lt only takes
six minutes to get there from here.

93
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,000
So, if you got somebody on the side,
you need to tell me.

94
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,400
Baby, listen to what you just say.

95
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,600
MapQuest said it takes six minutes
to get here. l got here in eight.

96
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,800
Which means there's two minutes
unaccounted for.

97
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,600
lf l was cheating on you, don't you think
l'd need more than two minutes?

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,300
You know what?
l ain't going to deal with this.

99
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,700
l'm tired, okay?
l had a long day at work. l got shot at.

100
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,500
See, that is exactly what l'm talking about.

101
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
We don't communicate.

102
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,900
-Okay, fine. You want to communicate?
-Yes.

103
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,700
Come on. Let's communicate. Okay?

104
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Okay. Let's start with last week.

105
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,700
Last week.

106
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,200
You and l were supposed
to go shopping together. We get to the mall.

107
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
l buy this beautiful dress,
l get my hair done.

108
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,700
You don't say anything. l don't know,
maybe you just don't want to....

109
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,000
Did you hear me just now?

110
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,600
Tell me what l said.

111
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
l heard everything. You was communicating.

112
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,200
Don't play with me right now.
l am not in the mood.

113
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,900
l cannot believe you came home late
and then you start....

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,100
Marcus! You are falling asleep again.
l am talking to you.

115
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
l wasn't asleep, l was closing my eyes
and visualizing your words.

116
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,100
Oh, really? Visualizing?

117
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,100
Why don't you paint me a picture
of what l just said?

118
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
-Hold on.
-You know why?

119
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,600
Because you are
falling asleep again. Marcus!

120
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,800
Well, if it isn't Ben and Jerry.

121
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,200
Let me ask you guys a question.

122
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,800
When the Chief goes to the bathroom,
which one of you guys holds his balls...

123
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,200
and which one wipes?

124
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,400
-That's the ball holder there.
-Yep. You can tell by the cup in his hand.

125
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,900
See, that is exactly the attitude that's going
to keep you guys working the shit detail...

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,700
while we're working
the socialite kidnapping case.

127
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,100
You guys got the socialite kidnapping case?

128
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,300
That's right.

129
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
What's that?
Oh, l think l hear the Chief flushing.

130
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,200
We'd better get going.
Whose turn is it to wipe? Yours?

131
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,900
l think it's your turn to wipe
and l'll hold the balls.

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's right.

133
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,400
<i>We received this from Mr. Andrew Wilson,
CEO of Wilson Cruise Lines.</i>

134
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,300
<i>It was delivered to his home.
The girls in the photo are his daughters...</i>

135
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,400
<i>and heiresses to the Wilson fortune.</i>

136
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,800
<i>We believe
they are the kidnapper's next victims.</i>

137
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,000
<i>Mr. Wilson has given us permission
to shadow his daughters.</i>

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
<i>We're going to set up surveillance...</i>

139
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,800
<i>and if the kidnapper strikes...</i>

140
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,000
<i>this time we will be ready.</i>

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,700
Now, the Wilson sisters will be flying
into JFK this morning.

142
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,600
So who's going to pick them up?

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Obviously, everyone has read
the profile on the girls.

144
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,400
Still, somebody's got to do it.

145
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,400
l don't think this is a good idea.

146
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,300
l don't care. We deserve to be on this case
just as much as Gomez and Harper.

147
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,000
l know, but we don't want
to interrupt the man in a briefing.

148
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,300
Well, somebody got to stand up to him.

149
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,300
-Chief.
-What?

150
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,100
-Marcus has something he want to tell you.
-What?

151
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,200
Chief, we just want to know
if we could get on the case.

152
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,300
You're on.

153
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,200
The boys over at lntel seem to think
that the kidnapper's a guy...

154
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,500
named Ted Burton.

155
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
lt says Burton was a partner of Wilson's...

156
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,500
and some other associates
in some business venture that failed.

157
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,000
Says he spent time in the Federal pen
and lost his fortune.

158
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,000
Guy's been MlA since his release and those
dates coincide with the first kidnappings.

159
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,900
-What do you think?
-l think this babysitting gig sucks.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,300
Dude, relax.

161
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,700
Look, man.
All we got to do is pick these chicks up...

162
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,300
drop their ass off in the Hamptons,
then we back in the Chief's good graces.

163
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,200
l didn't join the FBl to become a nanny.

164
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
l want to be on the street
where the action is.

165
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay, Blackie Chan, and you'll get there.
Can we just do this first, please?

166
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,200
-All right.
-You didn't put dairy in this, did you?

167
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
-No.
-Because you know l'm lactose intolerant.

168
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,000
Last time, l barely made it to the bathroom.

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,400
Why would l want to disturb your stomach?

170
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,400
There goes your girls.

171
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,600
Come on, man. Let's do this.

172
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
-Hi, l'm Kevin Copeland. This is--
-We already gave to the United Negro Fund.

173
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
-Wait. Hold on.
-Excuse us.

174
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
We're actually here
to escort you ladies to the Hamptons.

175
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,000
The bags are on the plane.
Take Baby and clean out his bag.

176
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,100
He didn't have his colonic
and he like pooped everywhere.

177
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
-What's this?
-Baby got to ride in the car seat.

178
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,200
Where the hell am l supposed to sit?

179
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,500
This ain't right.

180
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,100
Man, you guys sure got a lot of bags
for a weekend.

181
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,500
-This isn't a weekend.
-lt's the weekend.

182
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,000
Labor Day in the Hamptons.
The last weekend of the social season.

183
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,100
Only the hottest people
are going to be there.

184
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,900
And only the hottest of the hottest
are going to make it onto the cover...

185
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,800
<i>of Hamptons Magazine. And this is our year.</i>

186
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,300
Open the window.
Baby likes a little fresh breeze.

187
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,700
l just hope the Vandergeld sisters'
private jet crashes on the way there.

188
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,600
-Oh, my God, Brittany!
-You were thinking it!

189
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,900
-l know, but you said it.
-l know.

190
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,200
You know Heather totally hates you
because you slept with her boyfriend.

191
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,400
My God. So what?
l sleep with everyone's boyfriend.

192
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,700
ls everybody all right?

193
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,200
My God! Your lip.

194
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,100
My God! Your nose.

195
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,500
Marcus, are you okay?

196
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,100
-l'm cool.
-Baby's in a wreck!

197
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,600
l can't believe...

198
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,200
you think we're going to go to the Hamptons
with my face looking like that.

199
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,700
lt's really not that bad.
Just get some makeup and cover it up.

200
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,000
Put makeup on this?

201
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,700
l am so fricking pissed.

202
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,600
My God, this is like the worst day of my life.

203
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,500
l went to go get my brows done...

204
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
and l told her to make me look like J-Lo.

205
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,200
And then that fricking Russian toad
made me look...

206
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,400
like Liza Minnelli or something.

207
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh, my God! l'm going to have a B.F.

208
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,700
Wait. What's a B.F.?

209
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
She's going to have a bitch fit!

210
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,400
-You better get out of here.
-l am going to call your boss.

211
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,600
-You don't have to do that.
-No, l'll call the owner of the company.

212
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,600
Come on, just take it easy.
Look, we can work this out.

213
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,400
-l'm going to write a letter.
-No.

214
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,000
Please don't write a letter.
Look, just calm down.

215
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,500
You guys just stay here.
Stay here the whole weekend.

216
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Do whatever you want. But whatever you do,
do not leave this room.

217
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,500
Don't leave this room, because if you do,
everyone's gonna see those hideous scars.

218
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,900
Scar?

219
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,400
-My God! Permanent damage.
-My life is over.

220
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,500
lf l lose this job with these good benefits,
Gina's gonna kill me.

221
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
-Well?
-They won't go.

222
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,000
-What do you mean, they won't go?
-They won't go.

223
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,200
Marcus, this weekend in the Hamptons
means everything for these girls.

224
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,500
They won't show up with a scratched-up
nose and a busted lip for nobody.

225
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,600
That's cool.

226
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
What are you doing?

227
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,000
l'm just going to kill myself before
the Chief does.

228
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,600
-Bye-bye, Kevin.
-Come on.

229
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Don't do that. Stop being ridiculous.

230
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
l'm not being ridiculous. You heard the man.

231
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
One more screw-up, and we're through.

232
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,000
-l know, man.
-See? That's probably him right now.

233
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,700
Hey, what's up, Chief?

234
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,900
There's something me and Kevin
want to tell you.

235
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,100
Yeah, Chief? Hey.

236
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,500
Me and Marcus just wanted to thank you
for the opportunity, man.

237
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,000
No, we didn't.

238
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,800
Yeah, we really appreciate it.

239
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,100
They wanted to stop off
and get something to eat.

240
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,400
He's lying to--

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,200
Two, three hours max.

242
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Trust me.

243
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,300
lf l don't have them there in three hours,
l'll cut them off and mail them to you myself.

244
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,100
-All right, take care. Bye.
-He lied, Chief.

245
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Why did you do that? You know them girls
aren't going to be there.

246
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,700
They'll be there.

247
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,300
Hey, Josh.

248
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,900
How'd you like to be part of the team?

249
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,800
Where are the white women at?

250
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,100
Let's do this.

251
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
He's right. Make them bigger.

252
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,400
Chief. They're here.

253
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,800
All right, the girls are yours.
Stick with them. Don't blow your cover.

254
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,800
Yes, sir.

255
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,700
-Are you sure this is going to work?
-Just trust me. Follow my lead.

256
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,900
What's up, money? You got a problem?
What you looking at my ass for?

257
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,800
No, yo, hold my poodle.

258
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,600
What's up? Y'all got a problem?
Y'all want some of this?

259
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,300
You want some of this, punk? What, boy?

260
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,800
-l'll take the both of you.
-Let's get out of here.

261
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,000
-l got this for you. Kiss my black ass!
-Cut it out.

262
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,800
-He was looking at my ass like l'm a girl.
-You are a girl!

263
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,600
And you better start acting like one
or you're going to be an unemployed girl.

264
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,500
Damn. l'd sure like to cut that cake.

265
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,200
Here, yo, hold this!

266
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,100
Hey, you trying to look at my lumps?

267
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
l'll pull off my G-string and handle mine.

268
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
-l'll handle mine.
-Kevin, it's Gomez.

269
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,700
Welcome to the Royal Hamptons Hotel.

270
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,600
-The bags are in the car, José.
-The name is Gomez.

271
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,200
-Whatever.
-Yeah, great. Here. Take Baby.

272
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,800
Clean out his bag.
Poor thing just pooped everywhere.

273
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,000
<i>And teach him how to say,
''Quiero Taco Bell.''</i>

274
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,700
<i>-Thanks a lot, Rico Suave. Grazie.
-Thanks, Julio.</i>

Right away, ma'am.

276
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,400
Sweetie, you've got to slow up

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,000
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, checking in.

278

Sorry. They're new.

00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,500
-Dr. Dorfman did an amazing job.
-They feel so real.

No. Don't have a B.F. now--

295
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,600
l want to speak to your supervisor.
Better yet, l'm going to write a letter.

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,600
VlP. Learn your acronyms.

307
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,900
-What a sweetheart.
-Here you are. Enjoy your stay.

308
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Has anyone ever told you
you look just like Denzel Washington?

309
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,600
Yes, actually l have heard it once or twice.

310
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,700
What a beautiful chocolate man.

311
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,100
Beautiful. God.

312
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,200
-That was close.
-Yeah.

313
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
-Are they waving at us?
-l don't know.

314
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,900
-What are we going to do?
-Just act friendly.

315
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,600
My God.

316
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Well, don't act like you don't know us.

317
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,100
Karen, Lisa, Tori.

318
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,300
Oh, my God.

319
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,000
l haven't seen you in forever.

320
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,600
lt's only been a year.

321
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,400
Did you do something different
to your hair?

322
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,300
-No.
-You gain weight?

323
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,800
-No.
-l know! You just had a birthday.

324
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,100
-Yeah.
-Totally. Total fire sign. l knew it.

325
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,000
-l totally knew it.
-Wait a minute.

326
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,400
There is definitely...

327
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
something different about the two of you.

328
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,700
Collagen.

329
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,600
You little witch. How did you know?

330
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,400
Duh, it's totally obvious.
Your lips went from Cameron Diaz to Jay-Z.

331
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,000
You got taller, too.

332
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,000
We got our knees done.

333
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,100
You can do that?

334
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,600
-You should do that.
-Yes.

335
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, it was really good
seeing you ladies. Bye.

336
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,400
Excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?

337
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
To go freshen up.

338
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,100
<i>The Hamptons Magazine reception
just started, so let's hit it.</i>

339
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,800
Hey, check it out.

340
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,600
Are those the Wilson sisters?

341
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,900
More like the Wilt Chamberlain sisters.
l never noticed how big they are.

342
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,600
But l'd still bone.

343
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,200
My God. There's Heath.

344
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,800
Dude, are you hitting Karen Googlestein,
the soap heiress, too?

345
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,600
How do you keep that shit dangling?

346
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,200
l keep telling her l'm going to break
up with my girl.

347
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,100
You better hope Heather doesn't find out.

348
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,400
She won't.

349
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,400
At least until l wrap up this big deal
with her father.

350
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Hey, Mr. V.

351
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,900
And look, there they are.
The fen-phen twins.

352
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,000
They're hot.

353
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
What, are you blind?

354
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's Heather and Megan Vandergeld.

355
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,000
Your sworn enemies since you were like,
l don't know. Eight?

356
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,900
Did l say hot? l meant not.

357
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,800
-l totally hate them.
-Did you guys hear about Megan?

358
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,800
She got stopped by security at Saks
trying to pull a Winona.

359
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
God. Come on.

360
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,200
-This is going to be fun.
-Move.

361
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,700
Look who just flew in from the slums
of Beverly Hills.

362
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,100
lt's The Beverly Ho-billies.

363
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,000
-Squeeze me?
-No, you didn't.

364
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,200
l'm sorry, but we just saw your new video.

365
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,800
They had a screening
over at Saks Fifth Avenue...

366
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,700
in the security office.

367
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,800
A klept-ho-maniac.

368
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,900
Your mother shops at Saks.

369
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
What?

370
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,200
My God. You want to talk about mothers?

371
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,600
You want to talk about mothers.

372
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,400
lt's mother time. Okay.

373
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,800
Your mother's so dumb
she went to Dr. Dre for a Pap smear.

374
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,400
''Something's wrong, Dr. Dre.
My coochie's doing a beatbox.''

375
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,700
Yeah? Well, your mother is so stupid...

376
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,000
she exercises when she could just get...

377
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,000
liposuction or something.

378
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,400
Your mother's so old that her breast milk
is powdered. You breast-feed like this.

379
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,900
Your mother is so, like....

380
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,000
She's so....

381
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Megan, you go.

382
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,200
Your mother is so stupid...

383
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
that she goes to Barneys Rooftop
Deck Restaurant for lunch...

384
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,000
<i>and orders a niçoise salad and calls it
a ''ni-coise'' salad.</i>

385
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
''Ni-coise'' salad, right?

386
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Your mother's ass is so hairy...

387
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,000
it looks like Don King's about to pop out
and say, ''Only in America!''

388
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,100
Your mother's so stupid...

389
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,800
that she goes into Gucci
and she tries to buy, like, Fendi and stuff.

390
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Megan, Heather. Come on now, girls.
ls this any way to speak to your guests?

391
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,800
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson.

392
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,300
l haven't seen you since you were smaller.

393
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,600
Yeah. Well, we're all grown up now.

394
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,300
Yeah, l can see that.

395
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Ladies, l fully expect
to see you later at the White Party.

396
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,000
-l think it's gonna be the best one ever.
-We'll be there.

397
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,700
-Take care. Bye. Good seeing you again.
-Bye, Mr. V.

398
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,100
This isn't over yet.

399
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,400
This is a long weekend.
You better watch your back.

400
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,800
-Ladies.
-Whatever.

401
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,400
l can't believe you guys just did that
to the Vandergelds.

402
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,000
You know, they could take you
off the scene just like that.

403
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,000
-Yeah, but it was so cool, you guys.
-So cool.

404
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,600
<i>lsn't that Denise Porter from NY1 News?</i>

405
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,900
Yeah, l'm working on getting you
an interview with her.

406
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,300
Great for your image.

407
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
l think l'll go over there
and introduce myself.

408
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,700
-Do you think now's a good time?
-Actually, it's a perfect time.

409
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,800
-Wouldn't want to miss a photo op.
-Never that.

410
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,100
-See you later.
-Have fun.

411
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,500
-What's wrong? Did you just get cramps?
-Yeah.

412
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,600
-Do you need a tamp?
-Heating pad?

413
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,900
-Hors d'oeuvres?
-Thank you, Wolfgang Paco.

414
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,500
Would you give that to Baby? Thank you.

415
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,400
<i>-Bye, Chico. Vamonos.
-Bon appétit.</i>

416
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,500
l'll have one.

417
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,100
-Hi, my name is--
-Brittany Wilson, of course.

418
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,400
Yeah. How'd you know? Brittany Wilson.

419
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,200
Well, it's my job to know.

420
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,900
Your publicist, Tori, has been calling me
nonstop about setting up an interview.

421
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,600
lf l would've known you were so beautiful,
l probably would've called you myself.

422
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,200
Well, if l wasn't mistaken, l'd think
you were flirting with me, Miss Wilson.

423
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Me? Flirting with you? A girl? Never.

424
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,300
Sorry, honey. l don't eat sushi. Strictly beef.

425
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,800
-Boy, you're really strong, aren't you?
-lt's from all that protein.

426
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,800
My God. These are delicious.

427
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,600
You might want to slow down
on the cheese.

428
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,700
You mean, there's cheese,
as in dairy cheese?

429
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah. Unless you know another way
to make quiche.

430
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,500
-Ladies, l think l got to go to the bathroom.
-Good. We'll come with.

431
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,300
No, l can handle it myself.
Thank you, though.

432
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,800
Like we're going to let you go alone.

433
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,600
Time for touchups anyway.

434
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,300
Move, bitch.

435
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,400
My God, you guys.
Heath is here. What should l do?

436
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,300
l don't understand what you see in him.

437
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,000
He's an out-of-work actor
living in a share house.

438
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
And he drives a 3 Series BMW.

439
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,400
Tori, l really think that you need
to cut Heath a little bit of slack.

440
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,400
His aunt died three years ago
and he really needs new headshots.

441
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,600
He's just going through
a really rough time right now. Okay?

442
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,100
You okay?

443
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,600
Everything all right in there?

444
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,600
lt's fine. Shit.

445
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,900
Tiff, we're just going to
meet you outside. Okay?

446
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,600
Love you.

447
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Man, it may be summertime
in the Hamptons...

448
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,300
but it is snowing up in here.

449
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,900
Tony, hand me my boots
because l'm about to go skiing.

450
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,400
-Great game last night, Latrell.
-That's what l do, baby.

451
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Now that's what l'm talking about.

452
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,500
A white girl with a black girl's ass.

453
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,300
l'm taking that home to Mama.

454
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,800
Pardon me.

455
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,600
Santa must've come early this year...

456
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,700
because you were first on my Christmas list.

457
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,700
There it is, right there.

458
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,800
l want to know. Are you naughty or nice?

459
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,300

00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,000
''Once you go black,
you're going to need a wheelchair.''

00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,600
The only thing's that's going to be tight

You better answer me!

That looks so sexy.

Are you kidding?

00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,300
''Hi, l'm Cellulite Sally.
Look at my huge bedonkey.''

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,800
''And don't forget about me.
l'm Back Fat Betty.''

540
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,300
Now who could have said that?

541
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
Yeah, it's Tina the Talking Tummy.

542
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,600
l can't even wear a short skirt...

543
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,000
and a top without looking like a fat pig.

544
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,600
Calm down. l'll go see if there's something
else out there for you. Okay?

545
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,700
Do you think Heath will love....
Do you need help?

00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,200
l think l need a bigger size.

547
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Honey, you never need a bigger size.
Come here.

548
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,500
Let me show you a little trick.
Brace yourself.

549

Suck it in. Squeeze those cheeks, sister.

Suck it in. Come on. Work with me.

Don't give up on me.
You can do this. Suck it in.

552
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,800
Now that looks totally cute.

553
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,600
My God! Are you kidding?

554
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,900
''Hi, l'm Carnie Wilson before my
gastric bypass surgery.''

555
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,800
Well, what about this?
This goes with your skin tone.

556
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,900
Somebody throw Shamu back in the ocean!

557
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,300
Okay. Let me get you something else. Okay?

558
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,000
How's that?

l can't breathe.

560
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,600
Honey, this is just not going to work.
l'm sorry.

561
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Well, of course not.
You're wearing the wrong underwear.

00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,300
ls that better?

563
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,400
l can taste the leather.

564
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,500
Okay, you need a pair of hot shoes.
What size do you wear again?

565
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,000
-Fourteen.
-What?

566
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,000
Do you think you could bring us a size 10?

567
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,500
-A what?
-A 10.

568
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,500
lt's an open-toed slide.

569
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,200
lt gives you two sizes in the front
and two in the back.

570
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,800
-What about these? This one's--
-You bitch! That's so terrible.

571
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,000
Let me go
and see if there's some help out there.

572
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,800
Some professional help.
You need professional help. Hang on.

573
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,600
-Okay.

574
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Oprah. Somebody, help me.

Come on out, honey. Let's see.

578
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,800
Turn around.

579
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Honey, just relax. Breathe.

580
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
You know what? Maybe a nice dress.

581
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Okay. Who would you do?

582
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,400
-Janet Reno or Rosie O'Donnell?
-Oh, come on.

583
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,300
You've got to kiss and go down on them.

584
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,600
-What! Are you kidding me?
-And death is not an option.

585
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,700
l don't know. Rosie.

586
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,600
-You're a pig. That's disgusting.
-What are you talking about?

587
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,600
-Rosie's all right.
-Heads up. Here they are.

588
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,800
-Hold on. Who would you do?
-No time. We're on the job.

589
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,600
-He's got my gun and badge.
-Go get him!

590
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,700
Get in! Get in the car.

591
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,100
My God, l need a cigarette!

592
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,100
-Can you believe this?
-What do we do?

593
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,600
We follow them.
But we can't blow our cover.

594
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,600
-Give me back my bag.
-Oh, man.

595
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,400
l'll rip your head off.

596
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,000
Your ass is mine.

597
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,400
What is this girl, a track star?

598
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,100
You messed
with the wrong blonde today, pal.

599
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,200
-Holy Christ.
-Now l'm pissed.

600
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,500
l think she's bionic, dude.

601
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,900
Holy smokes.

602
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,700
-That was nice.
-Jeez, lady. All that for a bag?

603
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,700
lt's not just a bag. lt's Prada.

604
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,700
-lt was like a reality show.

605

-Right behind you.
-Nice going, Tori.

606
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,200
Way to get us sat at the losers' table.
l thought you had it all hooked up.

607
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,700
Excuse me. l do have the hook-up.

608
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,600
Don't blame me.
Blame Little Miss Def Jam over here...

609
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,000
who had to go, ''Yo' mama''
on the Vandergelds.

610
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,400
We could be finished in this town.

611
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,700
-Somebody had to stand up to those guys.
-They're the ''it'' girls.

612
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,600
-That's the way it's always been.
-Whatever.

613
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,700
Honey, quick. Give me a pat.

614
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,800
No, a powder for my nose. Quick.

615
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,100
Thanks.

616
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,200
No, l'm just kidding.

617
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,900
l tried to call you,
but your number changed?

618
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,200
Yeah, l know. l changed it.

619
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,600
Anyway, so, l was just wondering if maybe...

620
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,000
later we could--

621
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,800
Hello. Where have you been all night?
l've been looking all over for you.

622
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,600
Why are you talking to her?

623
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,500
Clean it up, coke whore.

624
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Do you have any more of that?

625
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,900
Don't hate me because you ain't me.

626
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

627
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,100
<i>Gentlemen, get out your wallets...</i>

628
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,100
<i>because you'll be bidding on a date...</i>

629
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,300
<i>with some of Hamptons'
most eligible bachelorettes.</i>

630
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,600
<i>First up, yours truly.</i>

631
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,100
<i>Who wants to start the bidding?</i>

632
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,500
<i>-$500?
-$500.</i>

633
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,300
<i>Okay. Do I hear $1,000?</i>

634
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,700
Well, looks like we're all
on the Vandergelds' D-list.

635
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,500
-ls this seat taken?
-Oh, no. Have a seat.

636
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,600
Can you believe this?
They're actually auctioning off women.

637
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,900
-Would you ever do anything like that?
-Well, it's for a good cause.

638
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,300
Besides, being wined and dined
by a rich guy might be nice.

639
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,500
l see, so you like rich guys?

640
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,700
lt might be a pleasant change
from all the losers that ask me out.

641
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,300
<i>-$3,000.
-That's good.</i>

642
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
l see.

643
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,800
<i>But I think that we can do better than that.</i>

644
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,500
<i>-$20,000.
-Sold.</i>

645
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,100
<i>$20,000. That is a new record.</i>

646
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,800
That is very good.

647
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,000
<i>Next to be auctioned is Tiffany Wilson.</i>

648
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,300
-That's you.
-Me?

649
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,100
You better do something.

650
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,000
Excuse me, honey. l'll be right back.

651
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,000
<i>Who wants to start the bidding?</i>

652
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,000
$4.

653
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,200
<i>$4. Do I hear $5?</i>

654
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,600
$1,000.

655
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,600
<i>$1,000. Does anyone wish to go higher?</i>

656
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,600
Yeah, l got $2,000 right here.

657
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,800
$3,000.

658
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,000
$5,000.

659
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,700
<i>Who said that?</i>

660
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,700
<i>$5,000 to the dirty geezer in the back.</i>

661
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,000
<i>I'm sure no one will wish
to go higher than that...</i>

662
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,500
<i>so we can just be done with it now.</i>

663
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,800
$10,000.

664
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,700
$20,000.

665
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,000
<i>$20,000! Going once, going twice--</i>

666
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,200
$50,000. Cash!

667
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,300
Fine.

668
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,600
Sold...

669
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,400
to the big black guy right there.

670
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,000
Step right up and claim your prize.

671
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,800
l don't want
to go on a date with Buff Daddy.

672
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,400
Come here, baby.

673
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,700
Dude, my feet are killing me.

674
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,900
And on top of that, that G-string
gave me diaper rash.

675
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,700
-How long we got to do this, man?
-Just a couple more days.

676
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,800
l don't have a couple of more days.
Do you know who my wife is?

677
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,800
Here, listen to this message.
She's losing her mind.

678
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,700
<i>...with another woman
doing what I think you're doing!</i>

679
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,100
You don't want to hear the rest.

680
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,200
By the end of the weekend,
we'll be heroes and all will be forgiven.

681
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,100
All right.

682
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,300
-You order room service?
-No.

683
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,900
Who is it?

684
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,800
Damn! These girls won't quit.

685
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,200
We'll be right there. We're coming. Hang on.

686
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,400
-Open up!
-Open.

687
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,700
One second.

688
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,400
We'll be right there. Hang on.

689
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,400
The ice cream's melting!

690
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,400
Hold tight, girls!
We're just shaving our feet, okay?

691
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,400
And braiding our vaginas.

692
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,800
What, did you guys forget?
lt's your turn to host the slumber party.

693
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,000
Okay, you guys. What does it mean...

694
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,800
when a guy is in a really bad relationship...

695
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,500
and it's really obvious
that he wants to be with you...

696
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,400
but he just can't seem to break up with
his girlfriend?

697
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,800
lt means you're a total booty call.

698
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,500
-My God! Brittany!
-Well, you were thinking it.

699
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,200
Well, you said it.

700
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,900
You know,
sometimes you sound just like a man.

701
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,600
So l've been told.

702
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,100
What she means to say, honey...

703
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,600
is maybe you're just making yourself
just a little bit too, like, available.

704
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,000
Come on, you guys.

705
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,100
Don't act like you haven't done it before.

706
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,400
You know how it is
when you really care about someone.

707
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,800
You call them all day long...

708
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,200
because you just wanna know
how their day is going...

709
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,100
and what they're thinking about
and if they're thinking about you.

710
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,300
You spend all day trying to find
the perfect outfit.

711
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,300
You even change your hairstyle
just so he'll take a second look.

712
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,200
But they never notice.

713
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,400
Sometimes l just wish
that they could trade places with us...

714
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,400
so that they would know how it feels.
You know?

715
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,000
Oh, my God. Look, it's Megan's commercial.

716
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,600
<i>I won't let genital herpes slow me down.
That's why I use Valtrum.</i>

717
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,900
<i>Hey. You want to play with me?</i>

718
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,900
<i>Sure.</i>

719
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,900
<i>I won't tell if you won't.</i>

720
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,500
l so could have done that part.
She doesn't even have herpes.

721
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,600
-All done.
-Really?

722
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,600
My God! This is so cool.

723
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,900
You know something?

724
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,600
l think you might have been black
in a previous life.

725
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,500
Fo' shizzle, my nizzle.

726
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,200
Okay. Enough of this girls' talk, ladies.

727
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,200
lt's time for some real fun.

728
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,900
Oh, yeah. That's what l'm talking about.

729
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Come on. Show us some of your skills.

730
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,800
Yeah, totally. Learn some of your skills.

731
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,100
-Actually--
-Go for it, sis.

732
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,600
-Tiffany's the expert.
-Yeah, but you made the video.

733
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,300
Come on. Show us.

734
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,900
You see, the first thing you do
is you gotta...

735
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,400
grab the thing here.

736
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,400
Not too tight or you'll get calluses.

737
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,100
Then you want to look that little sucker
in the eye...

738
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,900
and go:

739
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,400
''Come here, little guy.

740
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,800
''Come here, you little earthworm.''

741
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,800
You like that?
l learned that from an Eskimo porn.

742
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,300
Come here.

743
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,700
And then l'm going to teach you guys
''The Deep Throat.''

744
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,800
You want to make sure the passage is clear
all the way from your throat to your chin...

745
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,300
and you want to place the thing here.

746
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,800
And you just wanna....

747
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,000
Oh, yeah. You like that? You little freak.

748
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,800
-Guys like that?
-They love it.

749
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,800
And another thing they love is this.

750
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,800
They love....

751
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,900
You like it? l call that ''The Headbanger.''

752
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,500
-Don't you ever put it in your mouth?
-Never.

753
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,200
Never put it in the mouth. That's '80s.

754
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,000
You might as well go and buy a TransAm.

755
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,300
Okay. l'm ready. l think l can do it.

756
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,600
Good catch.

757
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,200
So you take the thing and you grab it...

758
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,000
but gentle, not to get calluses. Not pretty.

759
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,100
Then you look him dead in the eye
and you say:

760
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,000
''Good boy.''

761
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,500
You're scaring me.

762
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,300
And then comes the Headbanger.

763
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,800
Yeah. Tap.

764
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,000
Well done.

765
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,500
All right, l got another one for you.
Carmen Electra or Pam Anderson?

766
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,700
Easy.

767
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,400
But they both got a yeast infection.

768
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,300
Now that's tough.

769
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,000
-l'm going to go with Pam Anderson.
-You're disgusting.

770
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,200
-What?
-They got a yeast infection.

771
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,600
Who would you choose?

772
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,400
Hey, Gomez. We got a couple of bogeys.

773
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,100
-No time.
-Oh, come on!

774
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,900
lt's Pam Anderson, like you care.

775
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,300
Run their faces. Let's go.

776
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,200
-Brittany Wilson?
-Yeah, that's me.

777
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,700
Let's get her.

778
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,000
-Put the blindfold on her!
-Damn, this girl's strong.

779
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,800
-Who do you work for?
-lntimate Fantasies!

780
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,600
My God. You need help?

781
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,000
What are you doing?
Those are the strippers, Raoul and Tito.

782
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,300
Strippers?

783
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,700
-l thought they were going to kidnap me.
-That's part of their routine.

784
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,200
Oh, my God! l am so sorry.

785
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,600
Hotel security! ls everything all right here?

786
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,300
Everything is fine.
Just a little case of PMS. That's all.

787
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,700
l'm just one big, emotional wreck.

788
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,600
Could you guys go
get me some Midol and a Snickers?

789
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,200
-Let's get out of here.
-My ass is fat.

790
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,200
This is Harper. lt's all clear.

791
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,400
Okay, ladies. Let's focus.
We have to find the perfect spot.

792
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,000
Would you look at these
starving kids in Africa.

793
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,300
When l see them, l just want to cry.

794
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,400
l mean, why can't l be that skinny?

795
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,000
lt's okay, Megan.

796
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:24,000
Just think. They can't wear belly rings
with those bloated tummies of theirs.

797
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,100
That's true.

798
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,000
l feel so much better.

799
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,600
Skank alert.

800
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
My God, girls.
l totally forgot my suntan lotion.

801
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,100
l'm gonna get some suntan lotion.
l'll be right back.

802
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,500
Hey, Russ.

803
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,800
Hey, bro. Go long. l got a plan. Go.

804
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,400
Hey, yo! You do that again,
l'm going to bust....

805
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,600
l'll bust out in tears.

806
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,400
-lnbreds!
-You're a jerk.

807
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,500
My bad, sweetheart. Over here.
Don't hurt yourself.

808
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,600
Don't worry, l won't.

809
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,500
Sorry. Better lay off the spinach.

810
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,300
Tony. Let's go hunting.

811
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,500
-l'm so glad l got waxed today.
-Me, too. What did you get?

812
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,600
-The Bald Eagle.
-l got the Bermuda Triangle.

813
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,500
The Landing Strip.

814
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,000
l got the Buckwheat.

815
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,600
Disgusting.

816
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,200
What a beautiful, sunny day.

817
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,500
Oh, my God. What happened to the sun?

818
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,400
Easy, white chocolate.

819
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,100
l wouldn't want you to melt.

820
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,700
<i>Yeah. Hasta la vista, Schwarzenegro. Bye.</i>

821
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,600
Hey, kids! You guys want to make $5?

822
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,900
Okay, here's what l want you to do.

823
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,100
Yeah, l'll take the usual.
And put it on my tab.

824
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,900
Hey, Latrell Spencer!
Could we have your autograph?

825
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,700
-Sure, little buddy.
-Thanks. You're the greatest.

826
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,800
Hey, that's what l do, baby.

827
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,300

829
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,800
-Wow! You must be pretty good.
-l'm all right.

830
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,300
Sometimes l feel l should be paying them
to take my autograph.

831
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,100
l'm sorry, l didn't even get your name.

832
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,200
Latrell. Latrell Spencer. And you are?

833
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,700
-Denise Porter.
-Denise. Denise Porter.

834
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,600
You know, you look so familiar.
l feel like l've seen you somewhere.

835
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:46,100
No. l play pro ball.
Maybe you've seen one of my games.

836
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:50,600
No. But l mean if l did, l'm sure
l would've definitely remembered you.

837
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,300
Okay, well. Look, Denise...

838
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,200
l don't mean to be too forward or anything...

839
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,100
but l'm here in town,
checking out some real estate, and--

840
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,600
Oh, whereabouts?

841
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,500
-You know, up around over there.

00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,300
-More like around--
-East Hampton.

843
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,800
Just all over the place. lt's one big blur.

844
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,700
One big, business blur.

845
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,700
l kind of want to
get away from all that business and...

846
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,200
hang out with somebody
and have a real conversation.

847
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,900
So, l was wondering if you're not too busy...

848
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,700
-maybe we can hang out?
-Yeah, sure.

849
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,500
-Really? All right. Cool!
-Yeah.

850
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,600
So, l'll pick you up at about....

851
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,000
You know,
the jet should be here about 7:30...

852
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
and the limo will take about a half-hour.
About 8:00. ls that good?

853
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,900
-Yeah, 8:00 sounds great.
-8:00 sounds good? All right.

854
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,300
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

855
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,400
Hey, where's our $5?

856
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,300
All right, calm down.

857
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,200
Here you go. $5. $2.50 each.

858
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,400
-You promised to give us $5 each.
-Stay in school.

859
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,400
Cheapo.

860
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:09,800
l am not making excuses.
l refuse to believe it.

861
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,300
l am not making excuses.
l refuse to believe it.

862
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,000
-Really?
-l don't want to believe Marcus is cheating.

863
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,100
l don't wanna believe
Michael Jackson keeps carving up his nose.

864
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,400
Excuse me. Your card has been declined
for insufficient funds.

865
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,400
The rep's on the line.

866
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Yes, this is Mrs. Copeland.

867
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,400
$4,000 dress?
And where did l buy this dress?

868
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,400
The Hamptons!

869
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,800
Yes, l remember.

870
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,300
Thank you.

871
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,200
lt is on.

872
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,500
l don't see why l got to go out
with Mandingo and his anaconda.

873
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,400
'Cause if you don't, you'll blow our cover.

874
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,300
What you gonna be doing?

875
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,900
Me? l'm going to follow up on a lead.

876
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,700
You're going on a date.

877
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,300
She's a reporter.

878
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,400
Who else knows more
about the Hamptons people than her?

879
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,100
All right, so l like the girl. You're the one
always telling me to settle down.

880
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,400
And you should.

881
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,600
But that don't mean
l got to go with Buffy the White Girl Slayer.

882
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,400
All right. Look. Just go to dinner. Okay?

883
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,200
l'm only gonna be a couple of hours
and l'll meet you back at the club.

884
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,500
-You promise?
-l promise?

885
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,100
l'm serious, dude. Promise.

886
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,200
l do. l'm serious. All right.

887
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,900
Tell Latrell if he needs a condom...

888
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,500
there's an extra shower curtain
in the bathroom.

889
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,700
Hop in.

890
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,400
Take your time. Watch those marshmallows.

891
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,500
Ease on in there, now.

892
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,100
l won't bite unless you ask me to.

893
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,400
You are so beautiful.

894
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,900
Good boy, Baby.

895
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,400
How about we listen to a little bit of music?

896
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,000
What the....

897
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,100
How did you know? l love this song!

898
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,000
<i>Making my way downtown
Walking fast</i>

899
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,400
<i>Faces pass
And I'm home bound</i>

900
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,400
<i>And I need you</i>

901
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,800
<i>And I miss you</i>

902
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,500
<i>And now I wonder</i>

903
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,400
<i>If I could fall
Into the sky</i>

904
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,000
<i>Do you think time
Would pass me by</i>

905
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,900
<i>'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles</i>

906
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,600
<i>If I could
Just see you</i>

907
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,100
<i>Tonight</i>

908
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,900
-Good evening, madam. Welcome to Bella.
-Thank you.

909
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
What are you doing here?

910
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,900
l came to borrow the car
and the keys to his house.

911
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,700
Are you crazy? lf you crash this man's car,
he will kill you.

912
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,400
l won't crash it. Look. Just call me
before you leave. l'll bring it back.

913
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,800
Then you meet me back at the club.

914
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,600
No, my brother. You got to get your own.

915
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,800
Help me.

916
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,600
Thank you.

917
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,400
May l bring you something from the bar?

918
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,300
Let me have
a bottle of your best champagne.

919
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,100
-And bring us some oysters.
-Very good, sir.

920
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,300
l have to say, l was so....

921
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,900
l was happy
when l bought you at the auction.

922
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,200
l mean, it's very rare
l have the opportunity to...

923
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,500
bask in the ambience
of such a classy lady such as yourself.

924
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,100
Oh, my God!

925
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,900
-l am humbled by your...
-This athlete's foot is just killing me.

926
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,300
-...beautiful nature.
-That smell. That's infection.

927
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,900
-The most high-classness of your....
-My God. ls that a hangnail?

928
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,500
Captivated by your beauty.

929
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,200
Your bountiful curves remind me
of the hills in ltaly.

930
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,300
l'm sorry. You were saying?

931
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,900
-That's perfect. Thank you.
-Are you ready to order?

932
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,800
Yes, l'll have the chicken. White meat only.

933
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,000
And for the lady, perhaps a salad?

934
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,300
Perhaps not.
l'll have the steak, smothered in onions.

935
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,400
A rack of ribs. Pasta with extra garlic.

936
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,100
French fries with lots of vinegar and a
side of onion rings with lots of sauerkraut.

937
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,700
Have you ever had oysters?

938
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,700
Did you know oysters are an aphrodisiac?

939
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,600
Sorry.

940
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,400
My tongue's kind of big.

941
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,600
lt'll open. Hold it!

942
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,500
l'll push. Yeah. See, that did it there.

943
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,600
Just a little turn.

944
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,500
There's so many keys involved...

945
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,600
sometimes it's hard to figure out
what's what.

946
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,600
lt's Mei Ling.

947
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,400
What are you doing here? Girl, it's late!

948
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,900
Come on, now. You have to go home.
Get some rest.

949
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,300
You cannot stay. There are laws
against this kind of workmanship.

950
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,700
They'll think
l'm running some kind of sweatshop.

951
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,300
That girl does not know when to go home.

952
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,700
l'm telling you, she will stay here
and just clean forever.

953
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,500
This is really nice.

954
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,800
Yeah, this is dope.

955
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,300
Dope summer home l picked, boy.

956
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,900
Who's that?

957
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,700
The big, buff, bald dude with the fur?

958
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,700
That's my trainer.

959
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,600
You have your trainer on your wall?

960
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,500
Yes, well, for inspiration.
l want to look like that one day and...

961
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:09,100
<i>l come in every morning
and l look at the.... You ever see Titanic?</i>

962
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,900
-No, l haven't seen it.
-Me, either. You want something to drink?

963
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,900
-Yeah, sure. A glass of wine would be nice.
-Wine.

964
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,500
Okay, so l'll get you a glass of wine and....

965
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,100
That'd be in the kitchen, right?

966
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,000
l don't know. This is your house, Latrell.

967
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,300
Who? Oh, me! Latrell.

968
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,300
That's right. l'm Latrell. That's right.

969
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,000
l'm going to get you
a bottle of my wine in my house.

970
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,100
<i>It's my house and I live here</i>

971
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,500
Damn, little lady!

972
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,000
You sure can put it away.

973
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,500
You're so funny.

974
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,900
Voilà!

975
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,600
You have a dog.

976
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,100
No, l don't have no damn dog.

977
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,800
Well, then whose dog is that?

978
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,600
Shit.

979
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,100
That's not no dog.

980
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,200
That's family.

981
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,400
Hey, cousin.

982
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,600
Come here, boy.

983
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,800
He looks really mad! Are you okay?

984
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,000
Yeah, l'm fine. He just misses me, that's all.

985
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,400
Okay, boy, playtime's over. Let me up!

986
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:04,200
-You want me to go for help?
-No, we're just having fun.

987
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,300
You sure are playful today.

988
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,900
You want to go for a walk, boy?

989
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,800
l'll be right back!

990
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,300
You know what?
Forget this! l'm out of here!

991
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,100
l don't want to go on a date with a guy
and his dog is biting him and....

992
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,200
What's he doing now? What's that?

993
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,800
Don't pay him no mind.

994
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,000
He's just going to do that
until he falls asleep.

995
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,000
Now, where were we? Wine!

996
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,600
You know,
l like a woman with a little extra something.

997
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,300
A little cushion for the pushing.

998
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,000
l'd really love for you
to come to one of my games.

999
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:07,500
No, thank you. l've seen you play.
Not impressed.

1000
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:11,200
Excuse me? l'm the highest scoring forward
in the league!

1001
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:16,600
But all that talent? Totally overshadowed by
nothing but scandals and pure laziness.

1002
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,500
Come on! You're shooting under 50%
from the free throw line, okay?

1003
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,300
Your turnover ratio, abysmal.

1004
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,400
And on top of that, you can't shoot
three-pointers to save your life. So...

1005
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,900
squeeze me.

1006
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,900
No one's ever cared like that before.

1007
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,200
Come here, baby!

1008
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,200
Oopsie! l had a poopsie.

1009
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,800
Girl, we're going to get along just fine.

1010
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,900
Back at you!

1011
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,000
-Bask in the ambience!
-l'm going to be sick.

1012
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,100
So, no. l jump over the fence, fall.
l scrape my knee.

1013
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,300
-Get out of here.
-No, seriously, listen.

1014
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,700
l scrape my knee. l get chased by the cops
and l spend the night in jail.

1015
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,800
That's insane. You did all that
just to find J-Lo and Ben's hideaway?

1016
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,900
l can't help it. You know,
investigative journalism is my passion.

1017
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,600
So how'd you end up
writing puff pieces for the local news?

1018
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,300
Unfortunately, l made some enemies...

1019
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,200
and ended up getting fired from my last job.

1020
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,300
What happened?

1021
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,400
Believe me,
you don't want to know about that.

1022
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,300
Look, l spent all night talking about myself.

1023
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:42,300
Sometimes it's good for a man
to just sit back and listen.

1024
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,600
Well, since you put it that way.

1025
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,300
l did this piece on Warren Vandergeld.

1026
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,500
Him and his partners tried to swindle a guy.

1027
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,600
You talking about Ted Burton?

1028
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,800
Yeah, how did you know that?

1029
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,400
lt was in the paper. l read about it.

1030
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,300
But what they didn't report in the paper...

1031
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,300
was that Burton was 10 times smarter
than all of them.

1032
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,900
He embezzled millions
and stashed it in an offshore account.

1033
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,600
When Vandergeld heard the story
was going to break...

1034
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,800
he didn't want to be embarrassed.

1035
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,700
Well, there goes my job.

1036
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,700
You know, you're a good listener.

1037
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,700
lt seems like you have the whole package.

1038
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,800
Man!

1039
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,200
-Hello?
-Kev, you got to go.

1040
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:53,100
-What? Now?
-Yeah, now. We're on our way.

1041
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,100
Can't you stall him for a little while?

1042
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,500
Look, this man sang to me.
He tried to kiss me and on top of that...

1043
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,600
he been farting for the last 20 minutes.

1044
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,400
All right, l'll be there in a minute. Bye.

1045
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,200
-Cottontail!
-l'm coming, nigger!

1046
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,600
Gomez, what the hell are we looking for?

1047
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,100
l don't know. Something just isn't right
about these girls.

1048
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,200
l'm gonna check the bathroom.

1049
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,000
Find anything?

1050
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,500
No. Not yet.

1051
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,900
You won't believe what l....
What the hell are you doing?

1052
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,900
Sniffing chicks' underwear, man.
What is the big....

1053
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,600
lt's.... What?

1054
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,900
They're guys, aren't they?

1055
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,700
You really are disgusting.

1056
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,000
-Can l buy you a drink?
-Buzz off, Smallville.

1057
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,000
Oh, my God. l so don't get it.

1058
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:31,200
Guys think if they buy you a drink,
it's a free ticket into your pants.

1059
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,800
Well, it's not.

1060
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,300
-What can l get you?
-l'll have a Panty Dropper.

1061
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,200
-Screaming Orgasm.
-A Slow Comfortable Screw.

1062
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,600
A Blue Balls on the rocks.

1063
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:46,300
-l've had that before. That's a good drink.
-Don't drink too many.

1064
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,100
-Yo, Latrell.
-What's up?

1065
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,300
Excuse me, baby.

1066
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,100
-Latrell, my man! What's going on, brother?
-What's up, man?

1067
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,500
-Two apple martinis.
-You hitting that, bro?

1068
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,700
-This is a tough one to crack.
-Tiffany Wilson?

1069
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,200
The ex queen?

1070
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,700
Here. Drop a couple of these babies
in her drink, man.

1071
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,500
Are you sure this will work?

1072
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,000
Man, l just took two of them,
and l'm telling you...

1073
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,700
l'm boinking someone tonight, you know?

1074
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,900
Excuse me.

1075
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,900
That's for you, my little Miracle Whip.

1076
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,300
You need to loosen up. There you go.

1077
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,000
That's for you.

1078
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,300
-Oh, my God! ls that Britney Spears?
-Where?

1079
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,700
Right over there. Forget it, she just left.

1080
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,200
Oops, she did it again.

1081
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:50,000
-Let's drink up.
-Let's do it.

1082
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,400
To the last drop.

1083
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,200
That's good. You want to dance?

1084
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,100
You know, that's a great idea.
Here, hold Baby. Let's go, girls.

1085
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:18,600
l found out some interesting information.
Ted Burton turned the tables on Vandergeld.

1086
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,400
Tucked away $100 million.

1087
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,100
Been living the high life
ever since he got out of prison.

1088
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,000
There goes our motive.

1089
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,700
Those skanks think they're hot?

1090
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,100
Let's show them what sexy really is.

1091
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,700
They want to battle. Let's go, girls.

1092
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,800
You girls want some of this?

1093
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,900
Bring it on, sisters!

1094
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,000
Okay, let's do it!

1095
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,000
Five, six, seven, eight.

1096
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:35,900
Come on.

1097
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,700
Hold on.

1098
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:44,400
l know you hookers
don't think this is over with.

1099
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,300
Let's kick it old school.

1100
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,800
They suck!

1101
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,900
Oh, my God!

1102
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,200
We won!

1103
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,200
Come on, let's go.

1104
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,600
Get out of my way! Move it!

1105
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,800
l need a drink.

1106
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,900
Hey, Latrell, my man.

1107
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,400
So did it work, man?

1108
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,400
l don't know.

1109
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,200
But l got to dance.

1110
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,500
l got to hit this.

1111
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,500
Hold the dog.

1112
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,200
Let it out.

1113
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,400
Oh, yeah. Now it's out.

1114
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,000
l paid thousands of dollars on this outfit...

1115
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,400
and do you think he even noticed?

1116
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,700
lt's going to be okay.

1117
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:56,000
Little Miss Vandergeld walks in...

1118
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,900
and he just forgets all about me.

1119
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,600
Okay, let it out.

1120
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,500
l wonder...

1121
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,500
if he would think she was so hot...

1122
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,100
if he knew that she is broke.

1123
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,800
Vandergeld's broke?

1124
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,400
We mustn't talk of such things.

1125
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,900
No, we won't.

1126
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,300
But, yes, they're broke.

1127
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,700
My father even had to
loan her father money...

1128
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,500
just so that they could keep their house.

1129
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,200
They just paid us back.

1130
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,600
-You guys, l love you guys.
-We love you, too.

1131
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,300
l love you so much!

1132
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,900
Thank you.

1133
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,600
Can we get you some gum
or a mint or something?

1134
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,200
Hey, little girl.

1135
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,500
Really? l love you, too.

1136
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,000
What the hell are you doing? Give me her!

1137
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,900
Sicko. Where's Latrell?

1138
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,000
Dance floor.

1139
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,400
Good morning, snowflake.

1140
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,700
Oh, my God. Brittany!

1141
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,100
-What?
-We're on page six.

1142
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,000
-No.
-Yeah.

1143
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,800
Look. ''Wilson sisters rock Hamptons.''

1144
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,800
-Wilsons rock!
-We rocked!

1145
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:33,600
Wait. We weren't in the Hamptons
this weekend.

1146
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,900
No! We've been cloned!

1147
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,700
He's got to be around here somewhere.

1148
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:49,000
Girl, wait a minute.
lsn't that Marcus right there?

1149
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,200
-That's him, all right. Old lying dog!
-Caught you.

1150
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,600
That sounds like Gina.

1151
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,600
-Don't answer it. She'll go away.
-No, she won't.

1152
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,600
l'm not going anywhere
until you open this door!

1153
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:07,200
-l told you! What am l going to do?
-Just get rid of her.

1154
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,300
l'll get rid of her. You hide the stuff.

1155
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,900
-l'm not playing with you!
-Coming, baby!

1156
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,100
What is all that noise?

1157
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,500
Nothing! Okay, baby, l'm coming!

1158
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,000
l'm coming. Hide.

1159
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,600
Hey, baby! Hi, boo-boo.

1160
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,400
-Nice room you got, Marcus.
-Hey, baby, what you doing here?

1161
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,700
-l could ask you the same question.
-Me?

1162
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,000
l'm on assignment.

1163
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,600
Are you wearing lipstick?

1164
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,800
No. That's Kool-Aid. You want some?

1165
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:55,200
You know, it's filled with lots of
vitamin C and riboflavin.

1166
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,700
ls that a bra?

1167
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,800
No, this?

1168
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:02,900
This is the new holsters
they gave us at work.

1169
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:06,200
They're government issue.
You can put two guns in there and just....

1170
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,800
''Freeze, FBl!''

1171
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,200
-l know somebody's in here.
-Baby, nobody's in here.

1172
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,100
See? Nobody's in here.

1173
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,200
-Check under the bed--
-What do you mean, ''Check under the bed''?

1174
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,300
-l heard somebody on the phone.
-Check under the bed!

1175
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,500
-That's where everybody hides! Check it!
-Marcus! Nobody can fit!

1176
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,700
See, nobody here, right? Nobody there.

1177
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:30,100
-l'll look in the bathroom.
-Wait! No! Don't check the bathroom!

1178
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,300
You don't want me to check the bathroom!

1179
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,000
See? Nothing in the bathroom.
Nobody in the room. See?

1180
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,600
l told you no one was here. See?

1181
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,100
You know, baby, this gotta stop!

1182
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,000
-We can't have love if we don't have trust.
-l know, but look.

1183
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,600
l was at the restaurant and the card
wouldn't go through--

1184
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:55,500
Listen. lf we don't have trust,
we don't have nothing.

1185
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:58,200
This is not about trust. This is about--

1186
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,600
There she is, right there!

1187
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,600
Now, baby. l can explain.

1188
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,600
-l knew it.
-Baby, it's not what you think.

1189
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,900
-Baby, it's not what you think.
-Don't you even say nothing to me!

1190
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,300
l can explain. Baby, it's not what you think.

1191
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,900
He's a man!

1192
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,500
You're sick!

1193
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,200
There's a lot of lovely ladies
here today, boys.

1194
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,600
Hey, Russ.

1195
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,600
What happened to you?

1196
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,200
l fell.

1197
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,800
We have to find them and stop them
before they execute their evil plan.

1198
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,200
-Wait, what do they look like?
-Duh, us!

1199
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:04,300
Afternoon, ladies.

1200
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,500
The Chief would like
to have a word with you.

1201
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,400
My God, Tiffany. They're the Men in Black.

1202
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Come on.

1203
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,400
-Easy, Ponch and Jon. My hair!
-Let's move it along, pal.

1204
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,000
-Wait a minute!
-Let's go!

1205
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:20,400
Chief, we just got confirmation
that Burton's arrived at JFK.

1206
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,300
l want him trailed. Give him plenty of room.
l don't want anyone jumping the gun.

1207
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,400
l want to get this guy red-handed.

1208
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:29,100
-Get your hands off of me!
-Let's go.

1209
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,700
-Hey, easy!
-Right this way, girls.

1210
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,600
What the hell you guys doing
with the Wilson sisters?

1211
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,400
-Chief, these aren't the Wilson sisters.
-No, sir.

1212
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,200
Chief, check this out.

1213
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,100
My God! What are you doing?

1214
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,700
-That's on there pretty good.
-Let her go.

1215
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,600
That's nothing, Chief.

1216
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,700
How about....

1217
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,200
-Those are nice.
-That's enough!

1218
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,700
l don't know how he did that...

1219
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,100
but you can't fake these.

1220
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,900
My God! Look who's here.
lt's that beautiful--

1221
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,100
Save it!

1222
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:29,800
Because of you, l had to suspend
two of my best agents!

1223
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:32,900
-Chief, l can explain.
-l don't want to hear it!

1224
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,700
You're just lucky we caught Burton
before he could strike.

1225
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,800
But Burton is not our guy!

1226
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,300
Let me guess: Women's intuition?

1227
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,300
You're both fired.

1228
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,900
Turn in your guns and your badges.
This operation is over!

1229
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,900
-Come on, Chief! You can't fire us.
-l just did.

1230
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,900
Forget him, Marcus. We can do this ourself.

1231
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,400
-Look, all we got to do is--
-Wait.

1232
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,400
''We''? Kevin, this ain't about ''we.''

1233
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
lt's never been. lt's about you.

1234
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:05,500
You come up with some stupid idea
and l'm dumb enough to go along with it.

1235
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,300
And look where it's gotten me, Kevin.

1236
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,300
l just lost my wife and my job
because of you.

1237
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,200
So don't tell me about ''we'' no more,
all right?

1238
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,900
They bought it. The FBl is packing up.

1239
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,200
They'll be out of our hair in a couple hours.

1240
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,500
We could make the grab tonight.

1241
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,700
You sure you and your friend
can get the job done?

1242
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,200
Would l let you down, Mr. V?

1243
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,700
-Hey, man. l just want to say sorry.
-Forget about it, dude.

1244
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:43,900
No. You're right. You're absolutely right.
l've been selfish.

1245
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,600
l'm always dragging you into everything.
l never even asked what you want to do.

1246
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,500
l don't know, there's something about
always having you around, that just...

1247
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,900
makes me want to step up my game.

1248
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:58,700
l guess it's because l always know
you're gonna have my back.

1249
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,200
Hello?

1250
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,900
Thanks.

1251
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,400
-Who was that?
-That was Josh.

1252
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,200
Turns out that Vandergeld's prints
was all over the ransom note.

1253
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,100
-What are you doing?
-Calling the Chief.

1254
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:20,300
No, you ain't! You said we could do this
on our own, right?

1255
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,700
What about backup?

1256
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,700
l got you, you got me.
That's all the backup we need.

1257
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,800
Triple T-K-A.

1258
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,200
Time to totally kick ass!

1259
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,800
Three generations at the Bureau
and l'm the first to get fired.

1260
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,400
My dad is going to kill me!

1261
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,300
Yeah? What? Who?

1262
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,600
-Copeland!
-Copeland, you dick!

1263
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,500
You've got a lot of nerve, calling.

1264
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,700
Where?

1265
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,800
-You better not be wrong about this.
-What?

1266
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,900
-We might be getting our jobs back.
-What are you talking about?

1267
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,600
-We gotta go.
-What do you mean, go?

1268
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:10,600
How about this?
RuPaul or Whoopi Goldberg?

1269
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:14,200
-l told you, l'm not playing your games.
-Come on!

1270
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,900
-Any sign of Vandergeld?
-l don't see him.

1271
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,900
All right, keep an eye out for him.

1272
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,100
lf it's going down,
it's going to go down here.

1273
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,600
Thank God! There you are! l did it.

1274
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:44,300
-You did what?
-l got you into the fashion show!

1275
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:49,400
Brittany, did you hear that?
We're in the fashion show.

1276
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,300
Not if we don't get moving.
Come on, let's go!

1277
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:56,300
-Get the lead out, ladies.
-l mean, it's like you forgot.

1278
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,300
-You mean the Wilson sisters are in?
-And we're out?

1279
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:05,500
l'm sorry. That's just the way it is.
They're hot, you're not! So deal with it.

1280
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,300
-You! Straighten up that blouse, now!
-That's impossible!

1281
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:12,100
We've been on that catwalk every summer
for six years straight!

1282
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,600
Let's just cut to the chase.

1283
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,800
Who do we have to sleep with
for us to get in the show?

1284
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,300
Honey, you're so
barking up the wrong tree right now. Really!

1285
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,200
<i>lf you nail this, you're a shoo-in
for the cover of Hamptons.</i>

1286
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,600
Darlings! Where have you been?

1287
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,900
Megan! Don't!

1288
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,300
This is unacceptable.

1289
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,500
They just messed with the wrong girls!

1290
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,400
l've been looking everywhere for you.

1291
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:42,200
Can we get the Wilson sisters
their outfits now, please? Go.

1292
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,500
-Can we talk?
-Of course.

1293
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,800
You were incredible at the nightclub
last night.

1294
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,900
-Thank you. Thanks.
-lncredible.

1295
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,600
And Heather will be leaving after the party
tonight, and l was thinking...

1296
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,600
maybe you could come by around 2:00?

1297
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:04,300
Make that 3:00 a.m.

1298
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,700
You know what?

1299
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,500
l don't think so.

1300
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,000
Excuse me?

1301
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,600
You think l'm just a booty call.

1302
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,700
Well, l'm not.

1303
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,200
l deserve better than that.

1304
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,500
l'm tired of being your doormat.

1305
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,900
Honey...

1306
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:39,800
what makes you think you're that special?

1307
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
-Bastard.
-Excuse me.

1308
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,200
Asswipe!

1309
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,100
-You're going to regret that.
-l'm so scared.

1310
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,300
Oh, my God! Tiffany!

1311
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,200
-Thank you so much, honey.
-l am so proud of you.

1312
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,400
Thanks. l just wish l didn't feel so crappy.

1313
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,400
Honey.

1314
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:14,300
Sometimes a man can't see
when he has someone so special...

1315
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,500
sitting right in front of him.

1316
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,500
Are you, like, a lesbian?

1317
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,400
-l better go get changed.
-Okay.

1318
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this evening we are proud to present...</i>

1319
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,600
<i>the fall couture line, Aubrey Allure.
Please take your seats.</i>

1320
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,100
-Excuse me?
-You're not on the list.

1321
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:40,100
lnvitation, my ass!
They don't know how we do it.

1322
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,200
-Let's just blend.
-All right.

1323
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,300
Go! Get going! Move it!

1324
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,400
Didn't we just have this conversation?

1325
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,700
Can we get these fantastic supermodels...

1326
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:18,600
-back into their dressing rooms?
-l can't believe it!

1327
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,200
-They changed that quick!
-Amazing!

1328
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:05,800
These ought to get the critics' attention.

1329
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Second changes, everybody! Go! Now!

1330
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:44,100
This'll be a nice little treat.

1331
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,700
My God! What's happening?

1332
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:12,800
That's not mine!

1333
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,100
Let's get out of here!

1334
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,600
l'm sorry!

1335
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,000
Just give me your hand. lt'll be okay.

1336
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,100
l'm so sorry. Oh!

1337
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,700
Come here! l got you!

1338
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:36,600
Here we go. Up!

1339
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,000
-My God!
-l hope she's okay.

1340
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,400
l'm ruined.

1341
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,100
Looks like some people just don't know
when to quit. Come on, girls.

1342
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,600
-Help me.
-l got you.

1343
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,200
Karen, what are you doing?

1344
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:05,100
Look, someone has got to give those girls
a taste of their own medicine.

1345
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,700
So revolutionary! lt's so bold and so....

1346
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,000
So brilliant!

1347
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:57,400
Everybody, they're imposters!

1348
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,200
Hit the lights.

1349
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,500
Where's Brittany?

1350
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,600
Where are you?

1351
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,500
Get down!

1352
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,400
l told you you were going to regret it.

1353
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,500
You hit like a bitch! Come on.

1354
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:07,600
You run and l'll shoot you. Come on.

1355
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,600
-My turn.
-Mama?

1356
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,200
Girl, we going to need some backup.

1357
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,300
Girl, call NayNay and LaQuanda.

1358
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,800
Tell them to bring the Vaseline
and the straight razors.

1359
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,500
These bitches are on some other shit!

1360
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,100
What's going on?

1361
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:39,200
-Don't touch my dress!
-Vandergeld's got Tiffany!

1362
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,500
What? No one messes with my queen!

1363
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,400
Marcus! Are you okay?

1364
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,600
-No.
-What's wrong?

1365
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,600
These damn G-strings are killing me!

1366
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,100
-Freeze!
-FBl.

1367
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:59,400
You guys take care of them.
We're going after Vandergeld.

1368
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,900
Copeland! You're going to need this.

1369
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,000
Come on, let's go.

1370
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,500
FBl! Freeze!

1371
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,800
Daddy, what are you doing?

1372
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:16,100
Why don't you take your mother
and your sister and go on home?

1373
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,300
Daddy, why are you doing this?

1374
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,700
Daddy didn't tell you? He's broke.

1375
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,600
What do you mean, broke?

1376
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:25,500
Like Martha Stewart broke
or MC Hammer broke?

1377
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,400
-MC Hammer broke!
-No!

1378
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,400
l've been funneling money out of the charity
into a private account, just to get us by!

1379
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,800
Are you filming this?

1380
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:41,400
l'll give you something to shoot!

1381
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,600
-Get out of my way!
-l can't do that.

1382
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,400
Drop it!

1383
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:58,800
l got you, man. Man, we'll get that stain out.
Don't even worry.

1384
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,200
Don't move!

1385
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:03,400
Warren Vandergeld, you are under arrest!

1386
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:09,500
l just want to tell you, l appreciate
what you did. That was real brave of you.

1387
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,300
l had no choice. l couldn't let them take
my one true love away.

1388
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:19,200
Hey, dude. l'm not what you think l am.

1389
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:24,300
Baby, we all got secrets. That's okay.

1390
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:35,000
Are you telling me that you are not....

1391
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,200
-Yeah. l'm not a woman.
-White?

1392
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,500
The deception! The betrayal, man!
You deceived me!

1393
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,000
Calm down. l'm an FBl agent.
l was uncovering a--

1394
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:45,500
Negro, please!

1395
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:49,300
Didn't somebody tell you
this was an all-white party?

1396
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,900
Someone get this jigaboo away from me!

1397
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,600
Are you okay?

1398
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:56,000
Yes, l'm fine. Thank you.

1399
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,300
So, do l get to see my knight
in shining armor?

1400
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,400
-Well....
-Get a leg!

1401
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:04,100
Get off me!

1402
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,400
What do you mean?
l'm going to let you have it!

1403
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:08,600
-You ain't never met nobody like me!
-lt's me!

1404
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,400
You don't know who you messing with!
My name's Gina!

1405
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,700
lt's me.

1406
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,400
This is some Jerry Springer shit!

1407
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:29,200
Once again, you guys managed to do
everything l told you not to do.

1408
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:33,100
You caused over $250,000 worth of damage.

1409
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:35,100
Two people were shot.

1410
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:40,300
But at least you got the right guy.

1411
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,900
-Good work.
-Thanks a lot, Chief.

1412
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,400
But we couldn't have done it
without Gomez and Harper.

1413
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:48,600
All right,
l'll see you all in the office tomorrow.

1414
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:51,200
Good work, guys.

1415
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:55,500
<i>Who will be featured
on the cover of Hamptons Magazine?</i>

1416
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:58,000
l have to take care of some business.

1417
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,100
See you guys on Monday.

1418
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:03,300
So, who do you think wore those panties
you were sniffing?

1419
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,900
Kevin or Marcus?

1420
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:08,500
-Gomez, l told you. l was looking for DNA.
-Oh, yeah.

1421
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,300
What are you laughing at, ''Denzel''?

1422
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,800
''Oh, what a beautiful chocolate man!''

1423
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:18,200
You guys got some work to do?

1424
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:20,400
l'm Denise Porter. Good night.

1425
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,600
l'm Kevin Copeland. l'm an FBl agent.

1426
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:33,000
l make $30,000 a year after taxes.

1427
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,400
l don't drive a Bentley
and l don't have a house on a hill.

1428
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,300
But l'd really like to take you out.

1429
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:44,400
Are you kidding me? Any man...

1430
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,300
who would jump in front of a bullet for me...

1431
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,500
can definitely take me on a date.

1432
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,000
-Come on, girl, let's go.
-Wait, could l just please--

1433
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:03,900
-l have nothing more to say to you.
-l know. Just listen to me, please.

1434
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,800
Gina, l lied to you.

1435
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,400
l've hid things from you.

1436
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:12,200
But l have never cheated on you.
But l am guilty.

1437
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:16,700
l'm guilty of paying more attention
to my job than l do my wife.

1438
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:19,900
l'm guilty of not appreciating
all the little things you do for me.

1439
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Like getting your hair done.

1440
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,500
Wearing that sweet-smelling Chanel
cologne l love so much.

1441
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:31,200
But my biggest crime is that
l didn't tell you l loved you every single day.

1442
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:36,200
-You're not going to let him off that easy.
-Will you shut up?

1443
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,500
l love you.

1444
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:49,700
A wheelchair?

1445
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,800
Yes, but the feeling will come back,
l promise.

1446
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,800
<i>Making my way downtown
Walking fast</i>

1447
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:57,900
<i>Faces pass
And I'm home bound</i>

1448
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,300
Backup, Tony.

1449
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,000
Hey, girls.

1450
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,100
So you guys were pretending to be them
the entire time?

1451
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:13,000
Yes, we were.
But we was only doing our job.

1452
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,800
l hope you guys aren't too pissed off at us.

1453
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:17,500
We're so bummed!

1454
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,000
We liked Brittany and Tiffany...

1455
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:24,600
so much more when you were them.

1456
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,200
So much more!

1457
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:31,500
So l guess this means
we won't be hanging out any more?

1458
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:34,300
Don't say that. Of course, we will hang out.

1459
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:37,000
Oh, yeah. We'll all get together
and we're gonna go...

1460
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,400
shopping!
