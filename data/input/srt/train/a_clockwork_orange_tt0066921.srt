1
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:39,082
There was me.

2
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:42,122
That is, Alex,
and my three droogs.

3
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:45,882
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.

4
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:49,682
And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,
trying to make up our rassoodocks...

5
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:52,082
... what to do with the evening.

6
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:56,682
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.

7
00:01:56,922 --> 00:02:00,402
Milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom...

8
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:02,562
... which is what we were drinking.

9
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,402
This would sharpen you up...

10
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:08,402
...and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.

11
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:15,962
In Dublin's fair city

12
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:20,562
Where the girls are so pretty

13
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:24,522
I first set my eyes

14
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,002
On sweet Molly Malone

15
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:34,562
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow

16
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:39,002
Through streets broad and narrow

17
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:43,522
Crying, "Cockles and mussels... "

18
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:46,402
One thing I could never stand...

19
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,962
... was to see a filthy,
dirty old drunkie...

20
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,762
...howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers...

21
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:54,242
...and going "blerp blerp"
in between...

22
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:58,562
...as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts.

23
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:02,242
I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age.

24
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,522
But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.

25
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:16,722
Can you spare some cutter,
me brothers?

26
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:24,642
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to live anyway.

27
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:27,602
Not in a stinking world
like this.

28
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:33,282
And what's so stinking about it?

29
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:37,602
It's a stinking world because
there's no law and order anymore!

30
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,802
It stinks because it lets
the young get onto the old...

31
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,002
...like you done!

32
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:47,882
It's no world
for an old man any longer.

33
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:51,722
What kind of a world is it
at all?

34
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:53,762
Men on the moon.

35
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:56,402
Men spinning around the earth.

36
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:59,562
And there's not no
attention paid...

37
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:03,162
...to earthly
law and order no more.

38
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:06,002
Oh, dear land

39
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:08,602
I fought for thee

40
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:46,042
It was at the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy...

41
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:48,242
...and his four droogs.

42
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:50,882
They were about to perform
a little of the old...

43
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:54,922
...in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.

44
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:45,762
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking...

45
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:50,122
...billy goat
Billy-boy in poison.

46
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:52,482
How are thou...

47
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:56,362
...thou globby bottle of cheap,
stinking chip-oil?

48
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,522
Come and get one in the yarbles...

49
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:02,562
...if you have any yarbles...

50
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:05,682
...you eunuch jelly, thou.

51
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,602
Let's get them, boys!

52
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:07,642
The police!

53
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:09,802
Come on. Let's go!

54
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:34,242
The Durango 95 purred away
real horrorshow.

55
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:38,562
A nice, warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.

56
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:41,842
Soon it was trees and dark,
my brothers...

57
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:44,522
... with real country dark.

58
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:22,922
We fillied around with other
travelers of the night...

59
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,402
...playing Hogs of the Road.

60
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:27,562
Then we headed west.

61
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:31,322
What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.

62
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:32,762
That was a real kick...

63
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:37,282
...and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent.

64
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:25,642
Who on earth could that be?

65
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:35,882
I'll go and see.

66
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,802
Yes, who is it?

67
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:51,882
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!

68
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:57,002
My friend's bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone?

69
00:09:57,242 --> 00:10:00,362
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

70
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:03,202
But, missus, it's a matter
of life and death!

71
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:04,682
Who is it, dear?

72
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,362
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.

73
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:10,162
He wants to use the telephone.

74
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:13,522
I suppose you better let him in.

75
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,242
Wait a minute, will you?

76
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:21,482
I'm sorry, but we don't usually
let strangers in...

77
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:34,882
What do you want from me?

78
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:41,122
Pete, check the rest
of the house. Dim...

79
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:47,962
I'm singing in the rain

80
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:50,802
Just singing in the rain

81
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,322
What a glorious feeling

82
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:55,642
I'm happy again

83
00:10:56,962 --> 00:10:58,722
I'm laughing at clouds

84
00:10:59,802 --> 00:11:01,122
So dark up above

85
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:04,002
The sun's in my heart

86
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:07,122
And I'm ready for love

87
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:10,842
Let the stormy clouds chase

88
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:13,522
Everyone from the place

89
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:17,042
Come on with the rain

90
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:20,002
I've a smile on my face

91
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:22,922
I'll walk down the lane

92
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,762
With a happy refrain

93
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:28,602
And I'm singing

94
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:30,602
Just singing...

95
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:33,802
...in the rain

96
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,242
Viddy well, little brother.

97
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:41,082
Viddy well.

98
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:04,282
We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed...

99
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:08,922
...it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure.

100
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:13,922
So we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.

101
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:21,402
Hello, Lucy.

102
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:24,122
Had a busy night?

103
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:28,042
We've been working hard too.

104
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,082
Pardon me, Luce.

105
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,842
There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner...

106
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:45,202
...laughing and govoreeting.

107
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:50,442
The devotchka smeched away, not
caring about the wicked world one bit.

108
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:54,442
Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.

109
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:57,842
And in the short silence
before the next one came on...

110
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:01,122
...she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.

111
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,042
And it was like, for a moment,
O my brothers...

112
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:10,402
...some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.

113
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,762
And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott...

114
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,802
...standing endwise.

115
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:20,082
And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards...

116
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:21,882
...and then down again.

117
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,722
Because I knew what she sang.

118
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:28,242
It was a bit from
the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.

119
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:38,722
What did you do that for?

120
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,922
For being a bastard
with no manners.

121
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:45,802
Without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourself public-wise.

122
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:50,682
I don't like you should
do what you done.

123
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:54,402
And I'm not your brother no more
and wouldn't want to be.

124
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,002
Watch that.

125
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:04,882
Do watch that, if to continue
to be on live thou dost wish.

126
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:07,962
Yarbles!

127
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:10,842
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!

128
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:14,802
I'll meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

129
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:17,602
I'm not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless.

130
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,802
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

131
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:28,602
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

132
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:44,522
Doobidoob.

133
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:48,562
A bit tired maybe.

134
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:52,322
Best not to say more.

135
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,002
Bedways is rightways now.

136
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,522
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

137
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,162
Right, right?

138
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:15,522
Where I lived was with
my dada and mum...

139
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:20,002
...in municipal flat block
18-A, Linear North.

140
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:44,162
It had been a wonderful evening.

141
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:47,802
And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending...

142
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:50,882
... was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.

143
00:18:38,922 --> 00:18:40,202
Oh, bliss!

144
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:42,762
Bliss and heaven!

145
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:47,642
It was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.

146
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:52,282
It was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal.

147
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:55,842
Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship...

148
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:58,762
...gravity all nonsense now.

149
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:00,642
As I slooshied...

150
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:03,802
...I knew such lovely pictures.

151
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:23,922
Alex. Alex!

152
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,242
What do you want?

153
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:33,962
It's past eight, Alex.

154
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:37,162
You don't want to be
late for school, son.

155
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:41,082
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

156
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:43,762
Leave us be,
and I'll try and sleep it off.

157
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:46,642
And then I'll be as right
as dodgers for this after.

158
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:50,522
But you've not been
to school all week, son.

159
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:51,882
Got to rest, Mum.

160
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,122
Got to get fit.

161
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:57,922
Otherwise, I'm liable
to miss a lot more school.

162
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:03,042
I'll put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meself now.

163
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:08,122
All right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.

164
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:15,282
He's not feeling too good
again this morning, Dad.

165
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:17,282
Yes. Yes, I heard.

166
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:19,162
You know what time he got in?

167
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:22,282
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.

168
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:26,282
I wonder...

169
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:30,562
...where exactly is it
he goes to work of evenings.

170
00:20:32,642 --> 00:20:34,002
Like he says...

171
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:36,482
...it's mostly odd things he does.

172
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:37,842
Helping-like...

173
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:40,642
...here and there, as it might be.

174
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,482
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

175
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:24,562
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

176
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:28,562
Alex-boy!
Awake at last, yes?

177
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,042
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

178
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:34,242
She gave me the key.

179
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,042
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

180
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:42,122
Hence, not at school, yes?

181
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:45,482
A rather intolerable pain
in the head, brother sir.

182
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,762
It should be clear
by this afterlunch.

183
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:51,082
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

184
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:54,402
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, Alex-boy?

185
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:58,042
-Cup of the old chai, sir?
-No time, no time.

186
00:21:58,282 --> 00:21:59,802
Sit, sit, sit!

187
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:03,962
To what do I owe
this extreme pleasure, sir?

188
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:05,802
Anything wrong, sir?

189
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:09,722
Wrong? Why should you
think of anything being wrong?

190
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,242
Have you been doing
something you shouldn't?

191
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:13,722
Just a manner of speech.

192
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:16,882
Yes, well, it's just a manner
of speech from your...

193
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:20,242
...post-corrective advisor to you
that you watch out, little Alex.

194
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:23,882
Because next time it's not
going to be the corrective school.

195
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:28,242
Next time it'll be the Barley place,
and all my work ruined.

196
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,202
If you've no respect
for yourself...

197
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:33,402
...you at least might have some
for me, who sweated over you.

198
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:37,562
A big, black mark, I tell you,
for every one we don't reclaim.

199
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:40,882
A confession of failure
for every one of you...

200
00:22:41,122 --> 00:22:43,922
...who ends up in the stripy hole.

201
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,922
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

202
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:48,682
The millicents have nothing
on me, brother.

203
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:50,162
Sir, I mean.

204
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,842
Cut out this clever talk
about millicents.

205
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:55,202
Just because the police
haven't picked you up...

206
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:58,522
...doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

207
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:03,682
There was a bit of nastiness last night.
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?

208
00:23:03,922 --> 00:23:07,922
A few of a certain Billy-boy's
friends were ambulanced off late.

209
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:09,522
Your name was mentioned.

210
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:11,882
The words got to me
by the usual channels.

211
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:14,842
Certain friends of yours
were named also.

212
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:18,162
Nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usual.

213
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:19,922
I'm warning you, little Alex...

214
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:22,322
...being a good friend
to you as always...

215
00:23:22,562 --> 00:23:25,202
...the one man in this
sore and sick community...

216
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:28,042
...who wants to save you
from yourself!

217
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,282
What gets into you all?

218
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:51,682
We've been studying the problem
for damn well near a century.

219
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:53,962
But we get no farther
with our studies.

220
00:23:54,202 --> 00:23:56,602
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.

221
00:23:56,842 --> 00:23:58,882
You've got not too bad of a brain.

222
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:02,162
Is it some devil
that crawls inside of you?

223
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:04,202
Nobody's got anything on me.

224
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,082
I been out of the millicents'
rookers for a long time.

225
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:11,642
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.

226
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:13,642
You're about due, by my reckoning.

227
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:15,122
That's why I'm warning you...

228
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:18,722
...to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

229
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:20,242
Do I make myself clear?

230
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:21,842
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

231
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:25,322
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

232
00:24:25,562 --> 00:24:27,762
You can rely on me, sir.

233
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:32,722
Excuse me, brother.

234
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:36,442
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?

235
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:39,002
Just a minute.

236
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:05,802
Pardon me, ladies.

237
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:16,562
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

238
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:22,242
A bit cold and pointless,
isn't it, my lovely?

239
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:29,202
What's happened to yours,
my little sister?

240
00:26:31,282 --> 00:26:32,682
Who you getting, bratty?

241
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,962
Goggly Gogol?
Johnny Zhivago?

242
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:37,002
The Heaven 17?

243
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:44,802
What you got back home
to play your fuzzy warbles on?

244
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:49,122
I bet you've got little
pitiful, portable picnic players.

245
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:51,442
Come with Uncle
and hear all proper.

246
00:26:51,682 --> 00:26:54,602
Hear angel trumpets
and devil trombones.

247
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:56,802
You are invited.

248
00:28:15,802 --> 00:28:16,722
Hi, hi, hi, there.

249
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:17,922
Well, hello.

250
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,682
He are here!
He have arrived!

251
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:22,442
Hooray!

252
00:28:23,082 --> 00:28:25,762
Welly, welly, welly,
welly, welly, welly, well!

253
00:28:27,362 --> 00:28:31,922
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure
of this surprising visit?

254
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,682
We got worried.

255
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:46,122
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the old knifey moloko...

256
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:48,802
...and you had not turned up.

257
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:51,322
And we thought
you might have been, like...

258
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:53,802
...offended by something
or other.

259
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:56,322
So around we come to your abode.

260
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,642
Appy polly loggies.

261
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:06,922
I had something of a pain
in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

262
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,882
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

263
00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:12,442
Sorry about the pain.

264
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:15,522
Using the gulliver
too much-like, maybe.

265
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:21,922
Giving orders and
discipline and such, perhaps.

266
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:24,602
You sure the pain is gone?

267
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:28,002
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

268
00:29:48,602 --> 00:29:52,722
Let's get things nice
and sparkling clear.

269
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,322
This sarcasm,
if I may call it such...

270
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:01,202
...does not become you,
my little brothers.

271
00:30:01,722 --> 00:30:05,962
As I am your droog and leader
I'm entitled to know what goes on.

272
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:08,922
Now then, Dim.

273
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:13,162
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

274
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:18,682
All right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

275
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:21,242
That's part of the new way.

276
00:30:28,722 --> 00:30:32,482
New way?
What's this about a new way?

277
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:38,442
There's been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back, I know it.

278
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:42,562
If you must have it,
have it, then.

279
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:45,842
We go around shop crasting
and the like...

280
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:49,522
...coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each.

281
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:52,002
And Will the English
in the coffee mesto...

282
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:55,722
...saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast.

283
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,802
The shiny stuff. The ice!

284
00:30:58,042 --> 00:31:01,922
The big, big money's available,
is what Will the English says.

285
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:07,042
And what will you do
with the big, big, big money?

286
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,122
Have you not everything you need?

287
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:12,162
If you need a motorcar,
you pluck it from the trees.

288
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:15,322
If you need pretty polly,
you take it.

289
00:31:15,562 --> 00:31:19,962
Brother, you think and talk
sometimes like a little child.

290
00:31:20,802 --> 00:31:23,242
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

291
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:27,322
Good! Real horrorshow!

292
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:29,842
Initiative comes
to thems that wait.

293
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:33,362
I've taught you much,
my little droogies.

294
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:37,962
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

295
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:44,242
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?

296
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:48,122
-Something to sharpen us up.
-Some moloko plus.

297
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:54,202
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!

298
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:04,162
As we walked along
the flatblock marina...

299
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:08,482
...I was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.

300
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:11,162
So now it was to be
Georgie the General...

301
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:13,762
...saying what we should do
and what not to do.

302
00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:17,762
And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.

303
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:21,522
But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones...

304
00:32:21,762 --> 00:32:26,682
...and that the oomny ones used, like,
inspiration and what Bog sends.

305
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:30,842
For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.

306
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:34,042
There was a window open
with a stereo on...

307
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:37,442
...and I viddied right at once
what to do.

308
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:43,722
I had not cut into any
of Dim's main cables.

309
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:46,122
And so with the help
of a clean tashtook...

310
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:48,642
...the red, red kroovy
soon stopped.

311
00:33:48,882 --> 00:33:52,402
And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers...

312
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:55,202
...down in the snug
of the Duke of New York.

313
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:59,482
Now they knew who was
master and leader.

314
00:33:59,962 --> 00:34:01,802
Sheep, thought I.

315
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,122
But a real leader knows
always when, like...

316
00:34:04,362 --> 00:34:07,482
...to give and show generous
to his unders.

317
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:12,122
Now we're back to where we were.

318
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:13,642
Yes?

319
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:16,642
Just like before,
and all forgotten?

320
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,442
Right, right, right?

321
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:21,202
Right.

322
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:25,042
Right.

323
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:29,362
Right.

324
00:34:32,162 --> 00:34:34,242
Well, Georgie-boy...

325
00:34:34,602 --> 00:34:38,322
...this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.

326
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:40,962
Not tonight.

327
00:34:41,202 --> 00:34:42,802
Not this nochy.

328
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,882
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

329
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:49,602
You're a big, strong chelloveck,
like us all.

330
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:53,002
We're not little children,
are we, Georgie-boy?

331
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:57,122
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

332
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:05,522
It's this health farm.

333
00:35:06,602 --> 00:35:08,522
A bit out of the town.

334
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,922
Isolated.

335
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:16,402
It's owned by this rich ptitsa
who lives there with her cats.

336
00:35:17,002 --> 00:35:21,322
The place is shut down for a week
and she's completely on her own.

337
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:26,162
It's full up with, like,
gold and silver...

338
00:35:26,402 --> 00:35:28,322
...and, like, jewels.

339
00:35:29,722 --> 00:35:33,442
Tell me more, Georgie-boy.
Tell me more.

340
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:40,162
Oh, shit!

341
00:35:58,242 --> 00:35:59,042
Who's there?

342
00:35:59,602 --> 00:36:01,522
Excuse me, can you please help?

343
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:03,202
There's been a terrible accident!

344
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:06,242
Can I please use your telephone
for an ambulance?

345
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:09,162
I'm frightfully sorry.

346
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,442
There's a telephone in the
public house a mile down the road.

347
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:15,402
I suggest you use that.

348
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:17,602
But missus, this is an emergency!

349
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,562
It's a matter of life and death!

350
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,442
Me friend's lying in the middle
of the road, bleeding to death!

351
00:36:24,322 --> 00:36:29,162
I'm very sorry, but I never open
the door to strangers after dark.

352
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:33,122
Very well, madam.

353
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:35,642
You can't be blamed
for being suspicious...

354
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:39,522
...with so many scoundrels
and rogues of the night about.

355
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:42,202
I'll try and get help
at the pub, then.

356
00:36:42,442 --> 00:36:44,802
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

357
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:48,002
Thank you very much.
Good night.

358
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:24,482
Dim, bend down.

359
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:29,522
I'll get in that window
and open the front door.

360
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:58,682
Radlett Police Station?

361
00:37:58,922 --> 00:38:02,682
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere Health Farm.

362
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:08,402
I'm sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd just happened.

363
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:11,362
It's probably nothing at all,
but you never know.

364
00:38:12,242 --> 00:38:15,482
A young man rang the bell,
asking to use the telephone.

365
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:17,882
He said there's been
some kind of accident.

366
00:38:18,122 --> 00:38:20,482
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

367
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:24,442
His words sounded like those quoted
in the papers this morning...

368
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:28,722
...in connection with the writer
and his wife who were assaulted.

369
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:31,922
Just a few minutes ago.

370
00:38:34,082 --> 00:38:35,802
If you think that's necessary.

371
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:38,642
But I'm quite sure
he's gone away now.

372
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:41,842
All right, fine.

373
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:44,802
Thank you very much.

374
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:50,722
Hi, hi, hi, there.

375
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,242
At last we meet.

376
00:38:52,482 --> 00:38:56,962
Our brief govorett through the
letter-hole was not satisfactory.

377
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,402
Who are you?

378
00:39:00,602 --> 00:39:02,482
How the hell did you get in here?

379
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:07,522
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

380
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:13,082
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

381
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:15,842
You filthy old soomaka.

382
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:19,522
Now listen here,
you little bastard!

383
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:23,082
Just turn round and walk out
of here the same way you came in.

384
00:39:26,162 --> 00:39:27,602
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!

385
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:30,162
It's a very important work of art.

386
00:39:40,522 --> 00:39:42,882
What the bloody hell do you want?

387
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:46,922
To be perfectly honest, madam...

388
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:50,362
...l'm taking part in an
international students' contest...

389
00:39:50,602 --> 00:39:54,202
...to see who can get the most
points for selling magazines.

390
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:56,482
Cut the shit, sonny...

391
00:39:56,722 --> 00:40:01,082
...and get out of here before you
get yourself into serious trouble.

392
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:04,322
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here...

393
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:06,362
...before I throw you out!

394
00:40:06,842 --> 00:40:09,562
Wretched, slummy bedbug!

395
00:40:10,082 --> 00:40:13,642
I'll teach you to break
into real people's houses.

396
00:40:14,842 --> 00:40:15,722
Fucking...

397
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:16,922
...little...

398
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:18,922
...bastard!

399
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:28,562
-Let's go. The police are coming!
-One minoota, droogie.

400
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:37,682
You bastards! I'm blind!

401
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:41,802
I'm blind, you bastards!
I can't see!

402
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:58,162
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my little brothers.

403
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:02,522
I won't say a single solitary
slovo unless I have my lawyer here.

404
00:42:02,842 --> 00:42:05,282
I know the law, you bastards.

405
00:42:12,842 --> 00:42:14,442
Righty-right, Tom.

406
00:42:15,882 --> 00:42:19,602
We'll have to show our friend Alex
here that we know the law too.

407
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:22,402
But that knowing the law
isn't everything.

408
00:42:36,642 --> 00:42:39,202
Nasty cut you've got there,
little Alex.

409
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:42,042
Shame, isn't it?

410
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:44,842
Spoils all your beauty.

411
00:42:46,802 --> 00:42:48,322
Who gave you that, then?

412
00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:51,362
How'd you do that, then?

413
00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:55,802
What's your point, you bastard?

414
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:58,162
That is for your lady victim.

415
00:42:58,402 --> 00:42:59,602
You ghastly...

416
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:01,522
...wretched scoundrel.

417
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:04,922
Get him off me!

418
00:43:05,842 --> 00:43:07,882
You rotten little bastard!

419
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,002
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

420
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:18,842
Good evening, Sergeant.

421
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:20,122
They're in room B, sir.

422
00:43:20,362 --> 00:43:21,962
Thank you very much.

423
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:24,002
Sergeant...

424
00:43:24,242 --> 00:43:25,162
Good evening.

425
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,842
Good evening, Inspector.

426
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:29,882
-Would you like your tea now, sir?
-No, thank you, Sergeant.

427
00:43:30,122 --> 00:43:32,002
May I have some
paper towels, please?

428
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,402
We're interrogating
the prisoner now.

429
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:38,082
-Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
-Thank you very much.

430
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,522
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all.

431
00:43:43,442 --> 00:43:46,402
Oh, dear! This boy
does look a mess, doesn't he?

432
00:43:46,682 --> 00:43:48,442
Just look at the state of him.

433
00:43:48,682 --> 00:43:50,562
Love's young nightmare-like.

434
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:52,642
Violence makes violence.

435
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:54,802
He resisted his lawful arrestors.

436
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:59,362
This is the end of the line for me.

437
00:43:59,602 --> 00:44:02,642
The end of the line, yes.

438
00:44:02,962 --> 00:44:04,362
And what of me, brother sir?

439
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:06,202
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.

440
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:08,362
I was led on by
the treachery of others.

441
00:44:08,642 --> 00:44:11,362
Sings the roof off lovely,
he does, sir.

442
00:44:11,642 --> 00:44:14,762
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

443
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:16,762
It was all their idea, brothers.

444
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:19,562
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!

445
00:44:26,002 --> 00:44:28,642
You are now a murderer,
little Alex.

446
00:44:29,282 --> 00:44:30,562
A murderer.

447
00:44:31,322 --> 00:44:33,242
Not true, sir.

448
00:44:33,482 --> 00:44:35,202
It was only a slight tolchok.

449
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:37,882
She were breathing, I swear it.

450
00:44:38,282 --> 00:44:40,442
I've just come from the hospital.

451
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:42,882
Your victim has died.

452
00:44:43,122 --> 00:44:46,162
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.

453
00:44:46,402 --> 00:44:48,282
This is some new form of torture.

454
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:51,682
-Say it, brother sir.
-lt'll be your own torture.

455
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:55,562
I hope to God
it'll torture you to madness.

456
00:44:57,322 --> 00:45:00,282
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

457
00:45:00,522 --> 00:45:02,242
We'll hold him down.

458
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:06,002
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

459
00:45:34,242 --> 00:45:37,762
This is the real weepy and tragic
part of the story beginning...

460
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:40,122
...O my brothers and only friends.

461
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,722
After a trial,
with judges and a jury...

462
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:47,042
...and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator...

463
00:45:47,282 --> 00:45:51,202
...he was sentenced to 14 years
in Staja Number 84-F...

464
00:45:51,442 --> 00:45:54,842
...among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.

465
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:58,762
The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers...

466
00:45:59,002 --> 00:46:01,242
...against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.

467
00:46:01,482 --> 00:46:04,562
And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief...

468
00:46:04,802 --> 00:46:07,082
...at her only child
and son of her bosom...

469
00:46:07,322 --> 00:46:09,842
...like, letting everybody down
real horrorshow.

470
00:46:10,082 --> 00:46:12,842
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.

471
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:15,402
Right! Open up the cell!

472
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:17,002
Yes, sir.

473
00:46:32,642 --> 00:46:34,802
Here are the prisoner's
committal forms.

474
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,482
Thank you, mister.

475
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:40,642
-Name?
-Alexander DeLarge.

476
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,722
You are now in
H.M. Prison Parkmoor.

477
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:46,362
From this moment, you will address
all prison officers as "sir."

478
00:46:46,602 --> 00:46:47,402
Name?

479
00:46:47,602 --> 00:46:49,882
Alexander DeLarge, sir.

480
00:46:50,122 --> 00:46:51,122
Sentence?

481
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:52,522
14 years, sir.

482
00:46:52,762 --> 00:46:53,602
Crime?

483
00:46:53,842 --> 00:46:54,922
Murder, sir.

484
00:46:55,162 --> 00:46:58,002
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.

485
00:47:08,842 --> 00:47:11,122
You are now 655321 .

486
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:14,522
It is your duty
to memorize that number.

487
00:47:14,762 --> 00:47:16,722
Thank you, mister. Well done.

488
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:18,602
-Thank you.
-Let the officer out.

489
00:47:22,722 --> 00:47:25,122
All right, empty your pockets.

490
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:31,682
Are you able to see the white line
painted on the floor...

491
00:47:31,922 --> 00:47:33,202
...directly behind you...

492
00:47:33,442 --> 00:47:34,722
...655321?

493
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:38,482
Then your toes belong...

494
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,602
...on the other side of it!

495
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,962
-Yes, sir.
-Right.

496
00:47:49,362 --> 00:47:50,642
Carry on.

497
00:47:55,282 --> 00:47:56,162
Pick that up...

498
00:47:56,402 --> 00:47:59,082
...and put it down properly.

499
00:48:09,442 --> 00:48:11,362
One half-bar of chocolate.

500
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:16,122
One bunch of keys
on white metal ring.

501
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:20,922
One packet of cigarettes.

502
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:26,002
Two plastic ball pens.

503
00:48:26,242 --> 00:48:28,242
One black, one red.

504
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:34,402
One pocket comb, black plastic.

505
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:39,322
One address book,
imitation red leather.

506
00:48:47,722 --> 00:48:49,602
One ten-penny piece.

507
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:53,522
One white metal wristlet watch...

508
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:57,562
...Timawrist, on a white metal
expanding bracelet.

509
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:00,522
Anything else in your pockets?

510
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:02,962
-No, sir.
-Right.

511
00:49:03,202 --> 00:49:06,202
Sign here for your
valuable property.

512
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:16,682
The tobacco and chocolate
you brought in...

513
00:49:16,922 --> 00:49:18,162
...you lose that...

514
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:20,402
...as you are now convicted.

515
00:49:21,242 --> 00:49:24,322
Now over to the table
and get undressed.

516
00:49:31,082 --> 00:49:33,002
Were you in police custody
this morning?

517
00:49:33,242 --> 00:49:34,682
One jacket, blue pinstriped.

518
00:49:34,922 --> 00:49:35,962
Prison custody?

519
00:49:36,202 --> 00:49:37,202
Yes, sir, on remand.

520
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,202
-One necktie, blue.
-Religion?

521
00:49:39,482 --> 00:49:40,522
C. of E., sir.

522
00:49:40,762 --> 00:49:42,362
Do you mean the Church of England?

523
00:49:42,602 --> 00:49:44,282
Yes, sir.
The Church of England.

524
00:49:44,522 --> 00:49:45,482
Brown hair, isn't it?

525
00:49:45,722 --> 00:49:46,842
Fair hair, sir.

526
00:49:47,082 --> 00:49:48,042
Blue eyes?

527
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:49,642
Blue, sir.

528
00:49:49,882 --> 00:49:52,362
Do you wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses?

529
00:49:52,602 --> 00:49:53,402
No, sir.

530
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:55,522
One shirt, blue.
Collar attached.

531
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:59,362
Have you been receiving medical
treatment for any serious illness?

532
00:49:59,602 --> 00:50:02,002
One pair of boots, black leather.
Zippered. Worn.

533
00:50:02,242 --> 00:50:04,682
Have you ever had
any mental illness?

534
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:08,642
Do you wear any false teeth
or any false limbs?

535
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,002
One pair of trousers,
blue pinstriped.

536
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:14,482
Have you ever had any attacks
of fainting or dizziness?

537
00:50:14,722 --> 00:50:16,202
One pair of socks, black.

538
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:18,122
Are you an epileptic?

539
00:50:18,362 --> 00:50:20,802
One pair of underpants,
white with blue waistband.

540
00:50:21,002 --> 00:50:24,562
Are you now, or have you ever been,
a homosexual?

541
00:50:25,002 --> 00:50:25,842
Right.

542
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:28,522
-The mothballs, mister.
-Mothballs, sir.

543
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:30,762
Now then, face the wall...

544
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:33,722
...bend over and touch your toes.

545
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,522
Any venereal disease?

546
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:43,202
Crabs? Lice?

547
00:50:43,442 --> 00:50:46,322
-Through there for the bath.
-One for a bath.

548
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:49,522
What's it going to be, eh?

549
00:50:50,362 --> 00:50:53,722
Is it going to be in and out
of institutions like this...

550
00:50:53,962 --> 00:50:55,882
...though more in than out
for most of you?

551
00:50:56,122 --> 00:51:00,042
Or are you going to attend
to the divine word...

552
00:51:00,282 --> 00:51:03,842
...and realize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners...

553
00:51:04,082 --> 00:51:06,082
...in the next world
as well as this?

554
00:51:06,322 --> 00:51:08,282
A lot of idiots you are...

555
00:51:08,522 --> 00:51:13,002
...selling your birthright
for a saucer of cold porridge.

556
00:51:13,242 --> 00:51:14,882
The thrill of theft.

557
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:15,922
Of violence.

558
00:51:16,162 --> 00:51:18,722
The urge to live easy.

559
00:51:18,962 --> 00:51:21,522
Well, I ask you what is it worth...

560
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:24,002
...when we have undeniable proof...

561
00:51:24,242 --> 00:51:27,242
...yes, incontrovertible
evidence...

562
00:51:27,482 --> 00:51:28,762
...that hell exists?

563
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,162
I know!

564
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:32,842
I know, my friends.

565
00:51:33,082 --> 00:51:35,082
I have been informed...

566
00:51:35,322 --> 00:51:36,762
...in visions...

567
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,402
...that there is a place...

568
00:51:38,642 --> 00:51:40,962
...darker than any prison...

569
00:51:41,202 --> 00:51:45,082
...hotter than any flame
of human fire...

570
00:51:45,322 --> 00:51:46,602
...where souls...

571
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:50,882
...of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves...

572
00:51:52,682 --> 00:51:56,202
Don't you laugh, damn you!
Don't you laugh.

573
00:51:56,442 --> 00:51:59,322
I say, like yourselves...

574
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:01,082
...scream...

575
00:52:01,482 --> 00:52:05,002
...in endless and
unendurable agony.

576
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,042
Their skin...

577
00:52:07,282 --> 00:52:09,682
...rotting and peeling.

578
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:11,602
A fireball...

579
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:14,082
...spinning in their
screaming guts!

580
00:52:14,322 --> 00:52:17,602
I know. Yes, I know!

581
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:26,522
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258...

582
00:52:26,762 --> 00:52:28,002
...in the prisoner's hymnal.

583
00:52:28,242 --> 00:52:31,322
And let's have a little reverence,
you bastards!

584
00:52:32,922 --> 00:52:36,082
I was a wandering sheep

585
00:52:37,122 --> 00:52:39,642
-Sing up, damn you!
-I did not love the fold

586
00:52:39,882 --> 00:52:41,242
Louder!

587
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:48,282
I did not love my shepherd's voice

588
00:52:48,882 --> 00:52:53,082
I would not be controlled

589
00:52:54,162 --> 00:52:55,242
Louder!

590
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:58,602
It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.

591
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,602
Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.

592
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:05,842
Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders...

593
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,922
...and meeting leering criminals
and perverts...

594
00:53:09,162 --> 00:53:10,642
...ready to dribble all over...

595
00:53:10,882 --> 00:53:13,682
...a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.

596
00:53:19,442 --> 00:53:20,882
It was my rabbit...

597
00:53:21,122 --> 00:53:23,762
...to help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service.

598
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:26,922
He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.

599
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,082
But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young...

600
00:53:30,322 --> 00:53:33,602
...and also now very interested
in the Big Book.

601
00:53:53,842 --> 00:53:57,522
I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.

602
00:53:57,762 --> 00:53:59,562
And I could viddy myself
helping in...

603
00:53:59,802 --> 00:54:03,602
...and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in.

604
00:54:03,842 --> 00:54:07,042
Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.

605
00:54:18,482 --> 00:54:20,882
I didn't so much like
the latter part of the Book...

606
00:54:21,122 --> 00:54:23,162
... which is more like
all preachy talking...

607
00:54:23,402 --> 00:54:25,482
...than fighting
and the old in-out.

608
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:28,722
I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other...

609
00:54:28,962 --> 00:54:31,122
...and then drink
their Hebrew vino...

610
00:54:31,482 --> 00:54:34,402
...and getting onto the bed
with their wives' handmaidens.

611
00:54:34,642 --> 00:54:36,602
That kept me going.

612
00:55:06,642 --> 00:55:09,442
"Seek not to be like evil men.

613
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,882
Neither desire to be with them...

614
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:15,082
...because their minds
studieth robberies...

615
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:18,122
...and their lips speak deceits."

616
00:55:18,362 --> 00:55:21,722
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress...

617
00:55:21,962 --> 00:55:24,122
...thy strength
shall be diminished.

618
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,962
Fine, my son. Fine.

619
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:27,402
Father?

620
00:55:31,282 --> 00:55:32,962
I have tried, have I not?

621
00:55:33,202 --> 00:55:34,242
You have, my son.

622
00:55:34,482 --> 00:55:36,722
-I've done my best, have I not?
-lndeed.

623
00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:40,202
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have I?

624
00:55:40,442 --> 00:55:44,602
You certainly have not, 655321 .
You've been very helpful.

625
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,602
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

626
00:55:47,842 --> 00:55:49,082
Father...

627
00:55:50,482 --> 00:55:53,162
...can I ask you
a question in private?

628
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:56,562
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

629
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:08,762
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

630
00:56:11,762 --> 00:56:13,962
Don't be shy to speak up.

631
00:56:16,362 --> 00:56:17,642
Remember...

632
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:19,762
...I know of the...

633
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:23,682
...urges that can
trouble young men...

634
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,362
...deprived...

635
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:27,522
...of the society of women.

636
00:56:30,282 --> 00:56:32,522
It's nothing like that, Father.

637
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:39,362
It's about this new thing
they're all talking about.

638
00:56:39,882 --> 00:56:41,482
About this new treatment.

639
00:56:41,722 --> 00:56:43,962
It gets you out of prison
in no time.

640
00:56:44,202 --> 00:56:46,682
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

641
00:56:47,442 --> 00:56:49,602
Where did you hear about this?

642
00:56:49,842 --> 00:56:52,402
Who's been talking
about these things?

643
00:56:52,682 --> 00:56:55,002
These things get around.

644
00:56:55,242 --> 00:56:57,402
Two warders talk, as it might be.

645
00:56:57,642 --> 00:57:00,562
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

646
00:57:01,082 --> 00:57:04,322
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops...

647
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:07,042
...and the newspaper
tells all about it.

648
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:13,442
How about putting me in
for this new treatment?

649
00:57:15,002 --> 00:57:18,522
I take it you are referring...

650
00:57:18,762 --> 00:57:20,922
...to the Ludovico technique.

651
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:23,882
I don't know what it's called.

652
00:57:24,122 --> 00:57:25,922
I just know it
gets you out quickly...

653
00:57:26,162 --> 00:57:28,562
...and makes sure you
never get back in again.

654
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:31,962
That is not proven, 655321 .

655
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:36,202
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

656
00:57:36,642 --> 00:57:39,282
It has been used, hasn't it?

657
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,162
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

658
00:57:42,402 --> 00:57:44,762
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

659
00:57:45,002 --> 00:57:48,562
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers involved.

660
00:57:50,482 --> 00:57:53,202
I don't care about the dangers.

661
00:57:54,842 --> 00:57:56,922
I just want to be good.

662
00:57:58,122 --> 00:58:00,682
I want for the rest
of my life to be...

663
00:58:00,922 --> 00:58:02,922
...one act of goodness.

664
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:04,562
The question is...

665
00:58:04,962 --> 00:58:09,402
...whether or not this technique
really makes a man good.

666
00:58:10,202 --> 00:58:12,402
Goodness comes from within.

667
00:58:12,642 --> 00:58:13,722
Goodness...

668
00:58:13,962 --> 00:58:15,282
...is chosen.

669
00:58:15,642 --> 00:58:17,682
When a man cannot choose...

670
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:19,962
...he ceases to be a man.

671
00:58:21,682 --> 00:58:26,402
I don't understand about
the whys and wherefores, Father.

672
00:58:27,562 --> 00:58:30,362
I only know I want to be good.

673
00:58:32,402 --> 00:58:34,242
Be patient, my son.

674
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:36,642
Put your trust in the Lord.

675
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:41,922
Instruct Thy Son
and He shall refresh thee...

676
00:58:42,162 --> 00:58:44,922
...and shall give delight
to thy soul.

677
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,722
Amen.

678
00:59:13,362 --> 00:59:15,242
-Mister!
-All present and correct, sir!

679
00:59:15,482 --> 00:59:16,482
Right!

680
00:59:18,002 --> 00:59:20,002
All present and correct, sir!

681
01:00:13,282 --> 01:00:14,762
Prisoners, halt!

682
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:16,842
Now pay attention!

683
01:00:17,522 --> 01:00:19,202
I want you in two lines...

684
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:22,002
...up against that wall,
facing this way.

685
01:00:22,242 --> 01:00:23,722
Go on, move!

686
01:00:24,202 --> 01:00:25,162
Hurry up!

687
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:26,642
Stop talking!

688
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:34,722
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

689
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:51,162
How many to a cell?

690
01:00:51,402 --> 01:00:53,202
Four in this block, sir.

691
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:56,202
Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

692
01:00:56,442 --> 01:00:59,482
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

693
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:03,242
I agree, sir. We need
larger prisons, more money.

694
01:01:03,482 --> 01:01:05,202
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

695
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:07,682
The government can't be
concerned any longer...

696
01:01:07,922 --> 01:01:09,562
...with outmoded
penalogical theories.

697
01:01:09,842 --> 01:01:13,322
Soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders.

698
01:01:13,562 --> 01:01:16,962
Common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis.

699
01:01:17,202 --> 01:01:19,802
Kill the criminal reflex,
that's all.

700
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:22,162
Full implementation
in a year's time.

701
01:01:22,402 --> 01:01:24,562
Punishment means nothing to them.

702
01:01:24,802 --> 01:01:27,602
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

703
01:01:27,882 --> 01:01:28,962
You're absolutely right, sir.

704
01:01:29,202 --> 01:01:31,682
Shut your bleeding hole!

705
01:01:32,282 --> 01:01:33,762
Who said that?

706
01:01:34,362 --> 01:01:35,722
I did, sir.

707
01:01:41,722 --> 01:01:43,362
What crime did you commit?

708
01:01:43,602 --> 01:01:45,602
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

709
01:01:45,842 --> 01:01:48,442
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

710
01:01:48,682 --> 01:01:50,242
Fourteen years, sir.

711
01:01:51,482 --> 01:01:52,602
Excellent.

712
01:01:54,082 --> 01:01:55,202
He's enterprising...

713
01:01:55,442 --> 01:01:56,482
...aggressive...

714
01:01:56,722 --> 01:01:57,842
...outgoing...

715
01:01:58,082 --> 01:01:58,882
...young...

716
01:01:59,122 --> 01:02:00,362
...bold...

717
01:02:00,602 --> 01:02:02,042
...vicious.

718
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:03,522
He'll do.

719
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:04,842
Fine.

720
01:02:05,082 --> 01:02:06,522
We could still look at C-block.

721
01:02:06,762 --> 01:02:08,722
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

722
01:02:08,962 --> 01:02:10,602
I want his records sent to me.

723
01:02:10,842 --> 01:02:12,122
This vicious young hoodlum...

724
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:14,202
...will be transformed
out of all recognition.

725
01:02:14,442 --> 01:02:16,322
Thank you very much
for this chance.

726
01:02:16,562 --> 01:02:19,242
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

727
01:02:19,522 --> 01:02:21,922
-Shall we go to my office?
-Thank you.

728
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:29,682
Come in.

729
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:32,202
Sir!

730
01:02:32,442 --> 01:02:34,242
655321 . Sir!

731
01:02:34,482 --> 01:02:35,442
Very good, Chief.

732
01:02:35,682 --> 01:02:37,162
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

733
01:02:37,402 --> 01:02:39,802
Full name and number
to the governor.

734
01:02:40,602 --> 01:02:43,682
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

735
01:02:46,242 --> 01:02:49,242
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

736
01:02:49,482 --> 01:02:52,962
That was no less a personage
than the Minister of the Interior.

737
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:55,082
The new Minister of the Interior.

738
01:02:55,322 --> 01:02:58,122
What they call a very new broom.

739
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:02,562
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

740
01:03:02,802 --> 01:03:05,002
And orders are orders...

741
01:03:05,242 --> 01:03:08,642
...though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

742
01:03:08,882 --> 01:03:11,042
An eye for an eye, I say.

743
01:03:11,282 --> 01:03:14,122
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

744
01:03:14,362 --> 01:03:17,922
Why should not the state,
severely hit by you hooligans...

745
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,882
...not hit back also?

746
01:03:20,722 --> 01:03:22,602
The new view is to say "no."

747
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:26,082
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

748
01:03:26,322 --> 01:03:29,162
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

749
01:03:29,562 --> 01:03:32,002
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

750
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:34,562
You are to be reformed.

751
01:03:35,362 --> 01:03:37,762
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

752
01:03:38,002 --> 01:03:39,522
You will be leaving here.

753
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:43,842
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

754
01:03:44,122 --> 01:03:47,882
It's believed you'll be able to
leave state custody in a fortnight.

755
01:03:48,122 --> 01:03:49,922
I suppose that prospect
pleases you?

756
01:03:50,162 --> 01:03:51,882
Answer the governor's question!

757
01:03:52,122 --> 01:03:53,402
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

758
01:03:53,642 --> 01:03:55,882
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

759
01:03:56,122 --> 01:03:58,282
I'm very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

760
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:02,722
Sign this where it's marked.

761
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:07,722
Don't read it, sign it!

762
01:04:08,002 --> 01:04:11,522
It says you're willing to have
your sentence commuted...

763
01:04:11,762 --> 01:04:14,602
...to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

764
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:16,122
And this.

765
01:04:23,002 --> 01:04:24,522
And another copy.

766
01:04:36,562 --> 01:04:38,322
The next morning I was taken to...

767
01:04:38,562 --> 01:04:40,162
...the Ludovico medical facility...

768
01:04:40,402 --> 01:04:42,162
...outside the town center.

769
01:04:42,402 --> 01:04:43,842
I felt a malenky bit sad...

770
01:04:44,082 --> 01:04:45,922
...having to say goodbye
to the old Staja...

771
01:04:46,162 --> 01:04:49,282
...as you will, when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.

772
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:51,402
Right, halt the prisoner.

773
01:04:56,682 --> 01:04:59,042
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

774
01:04:59,282 --> 01:05:01,002
I've got 655321 ...

775
01:05:01,242 --> 01:05:04,762
...on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

776
01:05:05,082 --> 01:05:07,562
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

777
01:05:07,802 --> 01:05:09,042
I'm Dr. Alcot.

778
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:12,162
Dr. Alcot.

779
01:05:12,402 --> 01:05:13,722
Very good, sir.

780
01:05:17,322 --> 01:05:20,322
-Are you prepared for the prisoner?
-Yes, of course.

781
01:05:20,562 --> 01:05:24,402
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

782
01:05:25,242 --> 01:05:26,602
There, sir.

783
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:38,962
And there, sir.

784
01:05:44,202 --> 01:05:45,722
And there.

785
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:05,362
There you are.

786
01:06:07,402 --> 01:06:09,242
Prison escort, move forward!

787
01:06:12,282 --> 01:06:13,402
Halt!

788
01:06:15,402 --> 01:06:17,042
Excuse me, sir.

789
01:06:23,322 --> 01:06:26,442
Is that the officer who will
take charge of the prisoner?

790
01:06:35,602 --> 01:06:38,962
A word of advice, doc.
You'll have to watch this one.

791
01:06:39,202 --> 01:06:42,602
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again...

792
01:06:42,842 --> 01:06:45,882
...in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

793
01:06:46,122 --> 01:06:49,642
We can manage things.
Show the young man to his room.

794
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:52,522
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

795
01:07:00,922 --> 01:07:03,402
-Morning, Charlie.
-Good morning, Doctor.

796
01:07:04,602 --> 01:07:05,602
Good morning, Alex.

797
01:07:05,842 --> 01:07:08,322
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

798
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:10,122
Good morning, missus.
Lovely day.

799
01:07:10,362 --> 01:07:11,562
Indeed, it is.

800
01:07:11,802 --> 01:07:13,322
May I take that?

801
01:07:16,842 --> 01:07:19,242
-How are you feeling?
-Fine, fine.

802
01:07:19,482 --> 01:07:22,322
Good. In a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky...

803
01:07:22,562 --> 01:07:23,802
...and begin your treatment.

804
01:07:24,322 --> 01:07:26,802
You're a very lucky boy
to have been chosen.

805
01:07:28,642 --> 01:07:31,082
I realize that,
and I'm very grateful.

806
01:07:31,402 --> 01:07:33,442
We're going to be friends,
aren't we?

807
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:34,962
I hope so, missus.

808
01:07:37,962 --> 01:07:40,282
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sleep?

809
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:41,762
Nothing of the sort.

810
01:07:42,202 --> 01:07:44,802
-Vitamins will it be, then?
-Something like that.

811
01:07:45,282 --> 01:07:49,082
You're undernourished, so after
each meal we'll give you a shot.

812
01:07:49,322 --> 01:07:50,722
Roll over on your right side.

813
01:07:50,962 --> 01:07:53,682
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down.

814
01:08:03,202 --> 01:08:06,122
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

815
01:08:07,162 --> 01:08:08,922
It's quite simple, really.

816
01:08:09,482 --> 01:08:11,202
We're going to show you some films.

817
01:08:11,442 --> 01:08:13,682
You mean like
going to the pictures?

818
01:08:14,122 --> 01:08:15,682
Something like that.

819
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:16,722
That's good.

820
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:19,642
I like to viddy
the old films now and again.

821
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:23,962
And viddy films I would.

822
01:08:24,442 --> 01:08:26,322
Where I was taken to, brothers...

823
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:28,642
... was like no cine
I ever viddied before.

824
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:31,082
I was bound up
in a straitjacket...

825
01:08:31,322 --> 01:08:33,442
...and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest...

826
01:08:33,682 --> 01:08:35,882
... with wires running away from it.

827
01:08:36,122 --> 01:08:38,322
Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes...

828
01:08:38,562 --> 01:08:41,882
...so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.

829
01:08:42,122 --> 01:08:43,802
It seemed a bit crazy to me...

830
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:46,802
...but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.

831
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:50,282
If I was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight...

832
01:08:50,522 --> 01:08:53,802
...I would put up with much
in the meantime, O my brothers.

833
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:21,442
The first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine...

834
01:09:21,682 --> 01:09:23,522
...like it was done in Hollywood.

835
01:09:23,762 --> 01:09:25,802
The sounds were real horrorshow.

836
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:29,082
You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.

837
01:09:29,322 --> 01:09:31,522
You could even get
the breathing and panting...

838
01:09:31,762 --> 01:09:34,602
...of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time.

839
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:36,642
And then what do you know?

840
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:38,922
Soon our dear old friend...

841
01:09:39,162 --> 01:09:41,082
...the red, red vino on tap...

842
01:09:41,322 --> 01:09:42,402
...the same in all places...

843
01:09:42,642 --> 01:09:44,042
...like it's put out
by the same firm...

844
01:09:44,602 --> 01:09:46,122
...began to flow.

845
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:48,442
It was beautiful.

846
01:09:48,802 --> 01:09:51,002
It's funny how the colors
of the real world...

847
01:09:51,402 --> 01:09:53,162
...only seem really real...

848
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:55,522
... when you viddy them
on a screen.

849
01:09:58,322 --> 01:10:00,682
Now, all the time
I was watching this...

850
01:10:00,922 --> 01:10:03,082
...I was beginning
to get very aware...

851
01:10:03,322 --> 01:10:05,402
...of, like, not feeling
all that well.

852
01:10:05,642 --> 01:10:09,362
And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.

853
01:10:09,602 --> 01:10:13,762
But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film...

854
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,562
... which jumped right away
on a young devotchka...

855
01:10:16,802 --> 01:10:19,522
... who was being given
the old in-out, in-out...

856
01:10:20,362 --> 01:10:22,402
...first by one malchick...

857
01:10:23,162 --> 01:10:24,322
...then another.

858
01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:26,802
Then another.

859
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,962
When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick...

860
01:10:32,202 --> 01:10:35,562
...leering and smecking
and then going into it...

861
01:10:35,802 --> 01:10:38,882
...I began to feel really sick.

862
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,882
But I could not shut me glazzies.

863
01:10:42,122 --> 01:10:45,402
And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about...

864
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:47,562
...I still could not get out of...

865
01:10:47,802 --> 01:10:50,362
...the line of fire
of this picture.

866
01:10:53,002 --> 01:10:54,522
Get me up.

867
01:10:54,882 --> 01:10:56,602
I'm going to be sick.

868
01:10:57,562 --> 01:10:59,522
Get something for me to be sick in!

869
01:11:03,642 --> 01:11:06,362
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject...

870
01:11:06,602 --> 01:11:08,762
...to experience
a deathlike paralysis...

871
01:11:09,002 --> 01:11:12,682
...together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

872
01:11:13,522 --> 01:11:17,202
One of our early test subjects
described it as being like death.

873
01:11:17,442 --> 01:11:20,242
A sense of stifling or drowning.

874
01:11:20,962 --> 01:11:23,522
And it is during this period,
we have found...

875
01:11:23,762 --> 01:11:27,242
...the subject will make
his most rewarding associations...

876
01:11:27,482 --> 01:11:31,082
...between his catastrophic
experience, environment...

877
01:11:31,322 --> 01:11:33,922
...and the violence he sees.

878
01:11:35,922 --> 01:11:37,802
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.

879
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:40,322
You've made
a very positive response.

880
01:11:41,402 --> 01:11:45,122
Tomorrow there will be two
sessions, morning and afternoon.

881
01:11:45,362 --> 01:11:48,242
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

882
01:11:48,482 --> 01:11:51,522
I imagine you'll feel a bit
limp by the end of the day.

883
01:11:51,762 --> 01:11:54,962
But we have to be hard on you.
You have to be cured.

884
01:11:55,202 --> 01:11:56,202
It was horrible.

885
01:11:56,442 --> 01:11:57,962
Of course it was horrible.

886
01:11:58,202 --> 01:12:00,522
Violence is a very horrible thing.

887
01:12:00,762 --> 01:12:02,402
That's what you're learning now.

888
01:12:02,642 --> 01:12:03,842
Your body's learning it.

889
01:12:04,442 --> 01:12:07,082
I just don't understand about
feeling sick the way I did.

890
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:10,442
I never used to feel sick.
I used to feel the very opposite.

891
01:12:10,682 --> 01:12:13,482
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feel real horrorshow.

892
01:12:14,362 --> 01:12:17,682
You felt ill this afternoon
because you're getting better.

893
01:12:17,922 --> 01:12:20,962
When we're healthy,
we respond to the hateful...

894
01:12:21,202 --> 01:12:23,122
...with fear and nausea.

895
01:12:23,362 --> 01:12:25,442
You're becoming healthy,
that's all.

896
01:12:25,682 --> 01:12:28,642
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be healthier still.

897
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:21,122
It was the next day, brothers...

898
01:13:21,362 --> 01:13:22,842
...and I had truly done my best...

899
01:13:23,082 --> 01:13:25,442
...morning and afternoon
to play it their way...

900
01:13:25,682 --> 01:13:28,322
...and sit like a horrorshow
cooperative malchick...

901
01:13:28,562 --> 01:13:30,002
...in the chair of torture...

902
01:13:30,242 --> 01:13:34,322
... while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen...

903
01:13:34,762 --> 01:13:39,042
...though not on the soundtrack,
the only sound being music.

904
01:13:40,002 --> 01:13:42,482
Then I noticed,
in all my pain and sickness...

905
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:46,482
... what music it was
that, like, cracked and boomed.

906
01:13:47,362 --> 01:13:49,762
It was Ludwig van.

907
01:13:50,282 --> 01:13:52,722
Ninth Symphony, fourth movement.

908
01:14:07,762 --> 01:14:10,682
Stop it! Stop it!
Please, I beg you!

909
01:14:11,162 --> 01:14:12,362
It's a sin!

910
01:14:12,722 --> 01:14:14,242
It's a sin!

911
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:20,562
Sin?

912
01:14:20,802 --> 01:14:22,322
What's all this about sin?

913
01:14:22,802 --> 01:14:23,642
That!

914
01:14:23,882 --> 01:14:27,722
Using Ludwig van like that.
He did no harm to anyone.

915
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:30,282
Beethoven just wrote music.

916
01:14:30,922 --> 01:14:33,962
Are you referring
to the background score?

917
01:14:35,482 --> 01:14:37,322
You've heard Beethoven before?

918
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:41,242
So you're keen on music?

919
01:14:46,402 --> 01:14:48,082
Can't be helped.

920
01:14:48,842 --> 01:14:51,522
Here's the punishment
element perhaps.

921
01:14:52,482 --> 01:14:54,522
The governor ought to be pleased.

922
01:14:57,162 --> 01:14:59,002
I'm sorry, Alex.

923
01:14:59,282 --> 01:15:00,962
This is for your own good.

924
01:15:01,202 --> 01:15:03,482
You'll have to bear with us
for a while.

925
01:15:04,242 --> 01:15:07,802
But it's not fair.
It's not fair I should feel ill...

926
01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:10,842
...when I hear lovely,
lovely Ludwig van.

927
01:15:11,362 --> 01:15:13,602
You must take your chance, boy.

928
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,442
The choice has been all yours.

929
01:15:17,882 --> 01:15:20,522
You needn't take it
any further, sir.

930
01:15:20,842 --> 01:15:23,642
You've proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing...

931
01:15:23,882 --> 01:15:27,002
...is wrong, wrong
and terribly wrong!

932
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:29,082
I've learned me lesson, sir.

933
01:15:29,322 --> 01:15:32,122
I see now what I've
never seen before.

934
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:35,202
I'm cured. Praise God!

935
01:15:35,482 --> 01:15:37,802
You're not cured yet, boy.

936
01:15:38,642 --> 01:15:40,002
But, sirs.

937
01:15:40,242 --> 01:15:41,562
Missus!

938
01:15:41,882 --> 01:15:43,922
I see that it's wrong!

939
01:15:44,162 --> 01:15:48,042
It's wrong because
it's, like, against society.

940
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:50,842
Because everybody has the
right to live and be happy...

941
01:15:51,082 --> 01:15:53,762
...without being
tolchocked and knifed!

942
01:15:54,002 --> 01:15:56,962
No, no, boy.
You really must leave it to us.

943
01:15:57,202 --> 01:15:58,802
But be cheerful about it.

944
01:15:59,042 --> 01:16:02,202
In less than a fortnight now,
you'll be a free man.

945
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:40,202
Ladies and gentlemen...

946
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:43,202
...at this stage, we introduce
the subject himself.

947
01:16:43,442 --> 01:16:46,282
He is, as you will perceive,
fit and well-nourished.

948
01:16:46,522 --> 01:16:49,242
He comes straight from a night's
sleep and a good breakfast...

949
01:16:49,482 --> 01:16:50,442
...undrugged...

950
01:16:50,682 --> 01:16:52,442
...unhypnotized.

951
01:16:52,682 --> 01:16:56,202
Tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the world again...

952
01:16:56,442 --> 01:16:59,922
...as decent a lad as you
would meet on a May morning.

953
01:17:00,722 --> 01:17:03,362
What a change is here,
ladies and gentlemen.

954
01:17:03,602 --> 01:17:05,882
From the hoodlum
the state committed...

955
01:17:06,082 --> 01:17:08,762
...to unprofitable punishment
two years ago.

956
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:11,642
Unchanged after two years.

957
01:17:12,362 --> 01:17:14,482
Unchanged, do I say?

958
01:17:14,722 --> 01:17:16,082
Not quite.

959
01:17:16,322 --> 01:17:20,882
Prison taught him the false smile,
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

960
01:17:21,122 --> 01:17:24,282
The fawning, greased,
obsequious leer.

961
01:17:24,762 --> 01:17:26,562
Other vices it taught him...

962
01:17:26,802 --> 01:17:30,522
...as well as confirming him in
those he had long practiced before.

963
01:17:31,682 --> 01:17:34,602
Our party promised
to restore law and order...

964
01:17:34,842 --> 01:17:38,722
...and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace-loving citizen.

965
01:17:38,962 --> 01:17:42,842
This pledge is now
about to become a reality.

966
01:17:43,082 --> 01:17:46,642
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is an historic moment.

967
01:17:46,882 --> 01:17:51,202
The problem of criminal violence
is soon to be a thing of the past.

968
01:17:52,162 --> 01:17:54,002
But enough of words.

969
01:17:54,242 --> 01:17:56,402
Actions speak louder than.

970
01:17:56,642 --> 01:17:58,242
Action now.

971
01:17:58,722 --> 01:18:00,602
Observe all.

972
01:18:09,842 --> 01:18:12,282
Our necks are out
a long way on this, Minister.

973
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:14,562
I have complete faith in Brodsky.

974
01:18:14,802 --> 01:18:17,842
If the polls are right,
we have nothing to lose.

975
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:28,842
Hello, heap of dirt.

976
01:18:31,522 --> 01:18:35,642
You don't wash much, do you,
judging by the horrible smell.

977
01:18:36,162 --> 01:18:38,522
Why do you say that?
I had a shower this morning.

978
01:18:38,762 --> 01:18:41,282
He had a shower this morning.

979
01:18:41,762 --> 01:18:43,762
You trying to call me a liar?

980
01:18:44,002 --> 01:18:44,802
No, brother.

981
01:18:45,162 --> 01:18:48,122
You must think I'm awfully stupid.

982
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,282
Why did you do that, brother?

983
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,402
I've never done wrong to you.

984
01:18:57,642 --> 01:18:59,642
You want to know why I did that?

985
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:01,042
Well, you see...

986
01:19:01,282 --> 01:19:02,482
...I do this...

987
01:19:02,722 --> 01:19:03,882
...and that...

988
01:19:04,122 --> 01:19:07,202
...and this because I don't like
your horrible type, do I?

989
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:09,682
And if you want
to start something...

990
01:19:09,922 --> 01:19:12,322
...you just go ahead.
Go on!

991
01:19:12,562 --> 01:19:13,722
Please do!

992
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:17,042
I'm going to be sick.

993
01:19:17,842 --> 01:19:19,442
You're going to be sick, are you?

994
01:19:19,682 --> 01:19:21,962
I'm going to be sick.
Please let me get up.

995
01:19:22,682 --> 01:19:24,202
You want to get up?

996
01:19:24,602 --> 01:19:26,242
Well, now you listen to me.

997
01:19:26,922 --> 01:19:28,442
If you want to get up...

998
01:19:28,922 --> 01:19:30,802
...you've got to
do something for me.

999
01:19:31,482 --> 01:19:32,602
Here.

1000
01:19:33,082 --> 01:19:34,162
Here.

1001
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:36,442
You see that?

1002
01:19:37,402 --> 01:19:38,802
You see that shoe?

1003
01:19:40,082 --> 01:19:41,482
I want you to lick it.

1004
01:19:41,722 --> 01:19:42,962
Go on!

1005
01:19:43,962 --> 01:19:45,402
Lick it!

1006
01:19:48,362 --> 01:19:50,602
And, O my brothers,
would you believe...

1007
01:19:50,842 --> 01:19:54,002
...your faithful friend
and long-suffering narrator...

1008
01:19:54,242 --> 01:19:56,562
...pushed out his red yabzick
a mile and a half...

1009
01:19:56,802 --> 01:19:59,522
...to lick the grahzny,
vonny boots.

1010
01:20:00,282 --> 01:20:01,242
And again!

1011
01:20:01,482 --> 01:20:03,842
The horrible killing sickness
had whooshed up...

1012
01:20:04,082 --> 01:20:05,642
...and turned the joy of battle...

1013
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:08,922
...into a feeling
I was going to snuff it.

1014
01:20:09,162 --> 01:20:10,402
And again.

1015
01:20:10,882 --> 01:20:12,802
Nice and clean.

1016
01:20:15,322 --> 01:20:16,442
Thank you very much.

1017
01:20:16,682 --> 01:20:18,442
That will do very well.

1018
01:20:22,482 --> 01:20:24,682
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1019
01:21:32,242 --> 01:21:33,882
She came towards me...

1020
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:37,722
... with the light, like it was the
light light of heavenly grace.

1021
01:21:37,962 --> 01:21:40,082
And the thing that flashed
in me gulliver...

1022
01:21:40,322 --> 01:21:42,842
... was that I'd like to have her
there on the floor...

1023
01:21:43,082 --> 01:21:46,162
... with the old in-out,
real savage.

1024
01:22:01,602 --> 01:22:03,882
But quick as a shot
came the sickness.

1025
01:22:04,122 --> 01:22:06,562
Like a detective who'd been
watching around the corner...

1026
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,962
...and now followed
to make his arrest.

1027
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:23,362
Enough!

1028
01:22:23,682 --> 01:22:25,242
Thank you very much.

1029
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:27,162
Thank you, my dear.

1030
01:22:48,122 --> 01:22:50,682
Not feeling too bad now, are you?

1031
01:22:51,082 --> 01:22:53,242
No, sir.
I feel really great, sir.

1032
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:55,322
-Good.
-Was it all right, sir?

1033
01:22:55,562 --> 01:22:56,362
Did I do well?

1034
01:22:56,602 --> 01:22:59,802
Fine, my boy.
Absolutely fine.

1035
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:01,242
You see, ladies and gentlemen...

1036
01:23:01,482 --> 01:23:03,842
...our subject is impelled
towards the good...

1037
01:23:04,082 --> 01:23:07,602
...by paradoxically
being impelled towards evil.

1038
01:23:07,842 --> 01:23:09,482
The intention to act violently...

1039
01:23:09,722 --> 01:23:12,962
...is accompanied by strong
feelings of physical distress.

1040
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:15,802
To counter these,
the subject has to switch...

1041
01:23:16,042 --> 01:23:18,882
...to a diametrically
opposed attitude.

1042
01:23:19,522 --> 01:23:20,842
Any questions?

1043
01:23:21,082 --> 01:23:22,442
Choice!

1044
01:23:25,762 --> 01:23:29,122
The boy has no real choice, has he?

1045
01:23:29,362 --> 01:23:30,842
Self-interest.

1046
01:23:31,082 --> 01:23:32,882
The fear of physical pain...

1047
01:23:33,122 --> 01:23:37,482
...drove him to that
grotesque act of self-abasement.

1048
01:23:38,162 --> 01:23:40,162
Its insincerity
was clearly to be seen.

1049
01:23:40,402 --> 01:23:42,202
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

1050
01:23:42,442 --> 01:23:46,842
He ceases also to be
a creature capable of moral choice.

1051
01:23:47,082 --> 01:23:49,322
Padre, these are subtleties.

1052
01:23:49,562 --> 01:23:52,562
We're not concerned with motives,
with the higher ethics.

1053
01:23:52,802 --> 01:23:56,322
We are concerned only
with cutting down crime.

1054
01:23:58,562 --> 01:24:02,962
And with relieving the ghastly
congestion in our prisons.

1055
01:24:03,522 --> 01:24:05,882
He will be your true Christian...

1056
01:24:06,122 --> 01:24:08,122
...ready to turn the other cheek.

1057
01:24:08,362 --> 01:24:11,242
Ready to be crucified,
rather than crucify.

1058
01:24:11,482 --> 01:24:15,442
Sick to the very heart at the
thought even of killing a fly.

1059
01:24:15,682 --> 01:24:16,962
Reclamation.

1060
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:19,362
Joy before the angels of God.

1061
01:24:19,602 --> 01:24:22,602
The point is that it works!

1062
01:24:26,802 --> 01:24:30,002
And the very next day,
your friend and humble narrator...

1063
01:24:30,242 --> 01:24:32,202
... was a free man.

1064
01:25:09,042 --> 01:25:10,402
Son!

1065
01:25:11,922 --> 01:25:14,122
Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.

1066
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:16,602
Mum.

1067
01:25:18,362 --> 01:25:20,602
How are you, love?
Nice to see you.

1068
01:25:22,202 --> 01:25:24,442
-Dad.
-Lad. What a surprise.

1069
01:25:24,682 --> 01:25:26,682
-Good to see you.
-Keeping fit?

1070
01:25:27,402 --> 01:25:28,602
How are you, then?

1071
01:25:28,842 --> 01:25:30,882
I'm fine, fine.

1072
01:25:31,122 --> 01:25:33,002
Keeping out of trouble, you know.

1073
01:25:35,642 --> 01:25:37,282
I'm back!

1074
01:25:39,922 --> 01:25:40,882
Good to see you.

1075
01:25:41,122 --> 01:25:44,122
Why didn't you let us know
what was happening?

1076
01:25:44,482 --> 01:25:47,482
I wanted it to be, like,
a big surprise for you and Pee.

1077
01:25:47,762 --> 01:25:50,522
It's a surprise, all right.
A bit bewildering too.

1078
01:25:50,762 --> 01:25:53,482
We've only just read about it
in morning papers.

1079
01:25:53,722 --> 01:25:55,442
You should have let us know, lad.

1080
01:25:56,082 --> 01:25:59,842
Not that we're not very pleased
to see you again, and all...

1081
01:26:00,082 --> 01:26:01,522
...cured too, eh?

1082
01:26:01,762 --> 01:26:03,762
That's right.
They did a great job on me.

1083
01:26:04,002 --> 01:26:06,522
I'm completely reformed.

1084
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,722
Still the same old place, then?

1085
01:26:23,722 --> 01:26:26,442
There's a strange fellow
sitting on the sofa...

1086
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:29,682
...munchy-wunching
lomticks of toast.

1087
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:34,242
That's Joe.

1088
01:26:36,082 --> 01:26:37,962
He lives here now.

1089
01:26:38,242 --> 01:26:39,522
The lodger.

1090
01:26:39,762 --> 01:26:41,282
That's what he is.

1091
01:26:41,682 --> 01:26:43,602
He rents your room.

1092
01:26:53,842 --> 01:26:55,242
How do you do, Joe?

1093
01:26:55,482 --> 01:26:57,442
Find the room comfortable, do you?

1094
01:26:57,682 --> 01:26:59,562
No complaints?

1095
01:27:02,522 --> 01:27:04,282
I've heard about you.

1096
01:27:05,322 --> 01:27:07,002
I know what you've done.

1097
01:27:11,162 --> 01:27:14,682
Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.

1098
01:27:15,642 --> 01:27:17,322
So you're back, eh?

1099
01:27:17,562 --> 01:27:22,002
Back to make life a misery for
your lovely parents once more?

1100
01:27:22,282 --> 01:27:23,722
Over my dead corpse, you will.

1101
01:27:23,962 --> 01:27:27,122
Because, you see, they've let me
be more like a son to them...

1102
01:27:27,362 --> 01:27:29,242
...than like a lodger.

1103
01:27:30,802 --> 01:27:33,242
Don't go fighting here, boys.

1104
01:27:38,882 --> 01:27:40,642
Do put your hand
over your mouth, please.

1105
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,082
It's bloody revolting.

1106
01:27:47,402 --> 01:27:48,922
Are you all right?

1107
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:51,642
It's the treatment.

1108
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:54,402
It's disgusting.
Enough to put you off your food.

1109
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:58,282
Leave him be, Joe.
It's the treatment.

1110
01:28:00,282 --> 01:28:02,962
Do you think we ought
to do something?

1111
01:28:04,002 --> 01:28:07,202
Would you like me to make you
a nice cup of tea, son?

1112
01:28:17,522 --> 01:28:20,482
What have you done
with all me own personal things?

1113
01:28:24,602 --> 01:28:27,242
That was all...

1114
01:28:27,482 --> 01:28:29,082
...took away, son.

1115
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:31,362
By the police.

1116
01:28:31,762 --> 01:28:33,602
New regulation, see...

1117
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:36,762
...about compensation
for the victims.

1118
01:28:39,362 --> 01:28:40,922
What about Basil?

1119
01:28:43,802 --> 01:28:45,482
Where is my snake?

1120
01:28:55,322 --> 01:28:56,482
He met with...

1121
01:28:56,722 --> 01:28:58,442
...like, an accident.

1122
01:29:02,242 --> 01:29:03,642
He passed away.

1123
01:29:08,762 --> 01:29:10,802
What's going to happen to me, then?

1124
01:29:12,962 --> 01:29:14,122
I mean...

1125
01:29:15,202 --> 01:29:16,602
...that's my room he's in.

1126
01:29:16,842 --> 01:29:18,642
There's no denying that.

1127
01:29:19,642 --> 01:29:22,122
This is my home also.

1128
01:29:23,962 --> 01:29:27,282
What suggestions have you,
my Pee and Em, to make?

1129
01:29:32,962 --> 01:29:35,442
All this needs thinking about, son.

1130
01:29:36,642 --> 01:29:39,362
We can't very well
just kick Joe out.

1131
01:29:39,602 --> 01:29:41,362
Not just like that, can we?

1132
01:29:41,602 --> 01:29:42,602
I mean...

1133
01:29:42,842 --> 01:29:44,722
...Joe's here doing a job.

1134
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,162
A contract it is.
Two years.

1135
01:29:47,402 --> 01:29:50,962
We made, like, an arrangement.
Didn't we, Joe?

1136
01:29:52,642 --> 01:29:54,522
You see, son...

1137
01:29:55,802 --> 01:29:59,202
...Joe's paid next month's
rent already...

1138
01:30:00,682 --> 01:30:03,402
...so whatever we may do in
the future, we can't just say...

1139
01:30:03,642 --> 01:30:06,522
...to Joe to get out, now can we?

1140
01:30:06,922 --> 01:30:08,722
No, but it's much more than that.

1141
01:30:09,562 --> 01:30:11,882
I mean, I've got you two
to think of...

1142
01:30:12,122 --> 01:30:14,882
...who've been like
a father and mother to me.

1143
01:30:15,122 --> 01:30:17,962
It wouldn't be right for me
to go off and leave you two...

1144
01:30:18,202 --> 01:30:21,002
...to the tender mercies
of this young monster...

1145
01:30:21,242 --> 01:30:24,362
...who's been like
no real son at all.

1146
01:30:24,962 --> 01:30:27,202
Look, he's weeping now.

1147
01:30:27,442 --> 01:30:30,282
But that's all his craft
and artfulness.

1148
01:30:30,602 --> 01:30:33,242
Let him go and find
a room somewhere else.

1149
01:30:33,482 --> 01:30:37,602
Let him learn the errors
of his way, and that a bad boy...

1150
01:30:37,842 --> 01:30:41,162
...doesn't deserve such a good
mum and dad as he's had.

1151
01:30:46,642 --> 01:30:47,882
All right.

1152
01:30:48,922 --> 01:30:50,722
I know how things are now.

1153
01:30:52,122 --> 01:30:54,642
I've suffered and I've suffered...

1154
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:56,762
...and I've suffered.

1155
01:30:57,442 --> 01:31:00,522
And everybody wants me
to go on suffering.

1156
01:31:02,402 --> 01:31:04,482
You've made others suffer.

1157
01:31:04,962 --> 01:31:07,962
It's only right
that you should suffer proper.

1158
01:31:08,882 --> 01:31:10,482
I've been told
everything you've done...

1159
01:31:10,722 --> 01:31:12,602
...sitting around the family table.

1160
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,802
And pretty shocking
it was to listen to.

1161
01:31:16,682 --> 01:31:19,722
It made me real sick,
a lot of it did.

1162
01:31:21,602 --> 01:31:25,042
Now look what you've gone
and done to your mother.

1163
01:31:25,282 --> 01:31:26,842
Come on. It's all right now.

1164
01:31:39,242 --> 01:31:40,362
Right!

1165
01:31:41,082 --> 01:31:42,722
I'm leaving now.

1166
01:31:42,962 --> 01:31:45,002
You won't ever viddy me no more.

1167
01:31:45,242 --> 01:31:46,882
I'll make me own way.

1168
01:31:47,322 --> 01:31:50,842
Thank you very much. Let it lie
heavy on your consciences.

1169
01:31:52,122 --> 01:31:54,962
Now don't take it like that, son.

1170
01:32:54,682 --> 01:32:57,522
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1171
01:32:59,242 --> 01:33:02,242
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1172
01:33:05,762 --> 01:33:08,722
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1173
01:33:29,162 --> 01:33:30,562
Thanks, brother.

1174
01:33:47,762 --> 01:33:49,522
Jamey Mack!

1175
01:33:49,962 --> 01:33:51,362
May the hokey fly!

1176
01:33:51,682 --> 01:33:55,082
Mother of God and all the blessed
saints in heaven preserve us!

1177
01:33:56,722 --> 01:33:58,722
I never forget a face, me God!

1178
01:33:58,962 --> 01:34:00,242
I never forget any face.

1179
01:34:00,482 --> 01:34:03,162
Leave me alone, brother.
I've never seen you before!

1180
01:34:03,402 --> 01:34:06,722
This is the poisonous young swine
that near done me in.

1181
01:34:06,962 --> 01:34:08,082
Him and his friends.

1182
01:34:08,322 --> 01:34:11,082
They beat me and kicked me
and punched me.

1183
01:34:11,322 --> 01:34:12,802
Stop him! Stop him!

1184
01:34:13,042 --> 01:34:16,802
They laughed at me blood
and me moans, this murderous dog!

1185
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:20,282
Then there was like
a sea of dirty, smelly old men...

1186
01:34:20,522 --> 01:34:22,522
...trying to get at
your humble narrator...

1187
01:34:22,762 --> 01:34:26,282
... with their feeble rookers
and horny old claws.

1188
01:34:26,522 --> 01:34:29,202
It was old age
having a go at youth.

1189
01:34:29,882 --> 01:34:33,002
And I daren't do a single
solitary thing, O my brothers.

1190
01:34:33,282 --> 01:34:35,202
It being better
to be hit at like that...

1191
01:34:35,442 --> 01:34:37,922
...than want to sick
and feel that horrible pain.

1192
01:34:38,162 --> 01:34:39,522
All right, all right!

1193
01:34:39,762 --> 01:34:40,602
Stop it now!

1194
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:44,082
Come on. Stop breaking the
state's peace, you naughty boys!

1195
01:34:44,322 --> 01:34:47,042
Back away! Go away with you!

1196
01:34:47,282 --> 01:34:49,482
What's your trouble, sir?

1197
01:34:56,802 --> 01:34:58,122
Well!

1198
01:34:58,762 --> 01:35:01,122
Well, well, well!

1199
01:35:04,882 --> 01:35:07,282
If it isn't little Alex.

1200
01:35:07,522 --> 01:35:08,842
Long time no viddy, droog.

1201
01:35:09,082 --> 01:35:10,482
How goes?

1202
01:35:10,722 --> 01:35:11,922
It's impossible.

1203
01:35:12,162 --> 01:35:13,322
I don't believe it.

1204
01:35:13,562 --> 01:35:15,362
Evidence of the old glazzies.

1205
01:35:15,602 --> 01:35:17,322
Nothing up our sleeves.

1206
01:35:17,562 --> 01:35:19,522
No magic, little Alex.

1207
01:35:19,762 --> 01:35:23,082
A job for two
who are now of job age.

1208
01:35:23,442 --> 01:35:24,802
The police.

1209
01:35:39,882 --> 01:35:41,042
Come on, Alex.

1210
01:35:41,282 --> 01:35:42,762
Come for walking.

1211
01:35:53,882 --> 01:35:56,202
Come, come, come,
my little droogies.

1212
01:35:56,442 --> 01:35:57,922
I just don't get this at all.

1213
01:35:58,162 --> 01:36:00,242
The old days are dead and gone.

1214
01:36:00,482 --> 01:36:03,202
For what I did in the past,
I've been punished.

1215
01:36:03,482 --> 01:36:05,082
I've been cured.

1216
01:36:05,322 --> 01:36:06,482
That was read out to us.

1217
01:36:06,722 --> 01:36:08,482
The inspector read it
all out to us.

1218
01:36:08,722 --> 01:36:11,282
He said it was a very good way.

1219
01:36:11,522 --> 01:36:12,722
But what is all this?

1220
01:36:13,002 --> 01:36:15,402
It was them
that went for me, brothers.

1221
01:36:15,642 --> 01:36:18,202
You're not on their side,
and can't be.

1222
01:36:18,762 --> 01:36:20,842
You can't be, Dim.

1223
01:36:21,082 --> 01:36:23,642
It was someone we fillied with
back in the old days...

1224
01:36:23,882 --> 01:36:27,202
...trying to get his own revenge
after all this time. Remember?

1225
01:36:27,442 --> 01:36:28,802
A long time is right.

1226
01:36:29,042 --> 01:36:31,202
I don't remember them days
too horrorshow.

1227
01:36:31,442 --> 01:36:33,442
And don't call me Dim
no more, either.

1228
01:36:33,682 --> 01:36:35,682
Officer, call me.

1229
01:36:36,002 --> 01:36:39,322
Enough is remembered, though,
little Alex.

1230
01:36:39,922 --> 01:36:42,882
And this is to make sure
you stay cured.

1231
01:37:36,522 --> 01:37:37,602
That's enough.

1232
01:37:37,842 --> 01:37:40,362
A bit more. He's still kicking.

1233
01:37:58,442 --> 01:38:00,202
Cured, are you?

1234
01:38:01,802 --> 01:38:05,482
Be viddying you some more
sometime, droogie.

1235
01:38:20,122 --> 01:38:23,962
Where was I to go,
who had no home and no money?

1236
01:38:24,202 --> 01:38:26,322
I cried for meself.

1237
01:38:26,642 --> 01:38:29,322
Home, home, home.

1238
01:38:29,562 --> 01:38:31,362
It was home I was wanting.

1239
01:38:31,602 --> 01:38:34,482
And it was home
I came to, brothers...

1240
01:38:34,722 --> 01:38:37,242
...not realizing,
in the state I was in...

1241
01:38:37,482 --> 01:38:40,362
... where I was
and had been before.

1242
01:39:26,602 --> 01:39:28,522
Who on earth could that be?

1243
01:39:43,442 --> 01:39:45,042
I'll see who it is.

1244
01:39:56,122 --> 01:39:57,642
Yes, what is it?

1245
01:40:05,962 --> 01:40:07,122
Please...

1246
01:40:23,282 --> 01:40:26,482
Frank, I think this young man
needs some help.

1247
01:40:31,002 --> 01:40:32,362
My God!

1248
01:40:33,282 --> 01:40:35,442
What's happened to you, my boy?

1249
01:40:37,802 --> 01:40:41,322
And would you believe it,
O my brothers and only friends...

1250
01:40:41,562 --> 01:40:43,722
...there was your
faithful narrator...

1251
01:40:43,962 --> 01:40:46,322
...being held helpless
like a babe in arms...

1252
01:40:46,562 --> 01:40:48,842
...and suddenly realizing
where he was...

1253
01:40:49,082 --> 01:40:52,362
...and why "home" on the gate
had looked so familiar.

1254
01:40:52,602 --> 01:40:54,282
But I knew I was safe.

1255
01:40:54,522 --> 01:40:56,482
I knew he would not remember me.

1256
01:40:56,722 --> 01:40:58,402
For in those carefree days...

1257
01:40:58,642 --> 01:41:00,442
...I and my so-called droogs...

1258
01:41:00,682 --> 01:41:04,042
... wore our maskies, which were
like real horrorshow disguises.

1259
01:41:05,282 --> 01:41:06,442
Police.

1260
01:41:09,962 --> 01:41:12,042
Ghastly, horrible police...

1261
01:41:13,962 --> 01:41:15,482
...they beat me up, sir.

1262
01:41:19,602 --> 01:41:21,882
The police beat me up.

1263
01:41:23,882 --> 01:41:25,482
I know you!

1264
01:41:29,522 --> 01:41:31,562
Isn't it your picture
in the newspapers?

1265
01:41:31,802 --> 01:41:33,922
Didn't I see you
on the video this morning?

1266
01:41:34,162 --> 01:41:37,362
Are you not the poor victim
of this horrible new technique?

1267
01:41:37,642 --> 01:41:38,842
Yes, sir.

1268
01:41:39,282 --> 01:41:42,362
That's exactly who I am and
what I am, sir. A victim.

1269
01:41:42,602 --> 01:41:45,602
Then, by God, you've been
sent here by providence!

1270
01:41:45,842 --> 01:41:48,802
Tortured in prison, then
tortured by the police.

1271
01:41:49,042 --> 01:41:53,362
My heart goes out to you.
You're not the first to come here.

1272
01:41:53,602 --> 01:41:56,362
The police like to bring
their victims to this village.

1273
01:41:56,602 --> 01:41:57,922
But it's providential that you...

1274
01:41:58,162 --> 01:42:01,562
...who are also another kind
of victim, should come here.

1275
01:42:03,442 --> 01:42:06,362
But you're cold and shivering.

1276
01:42:06,842 --> 01:42:08,162
Julian...

1277
01:42:08,402 --> 01:42:10,562
...draw a bath for this young man.

1278
01:42:10,802 --> 01:42:12,082
Certainly, Frank.

1279
01:42:12,442 --> 01:42:14,002
Thank you very much.

1280
01:42:14,242 --> 01:42:15,802
God bless you.

1281
01:43:08,482 --> 01:43:10,682
He can be the most potent
weapon imaginable...

1282
01:43:10,922 --> 01:43:13,962
...to ensure the government
is not returned in the election.

1283
01:43:14,202 --> 01:43:15,922
The government's big boast, sir...

1284
01:43:16,162 --> 01:43:18,762
...is the way they have
dealt with crime:

1285
01:43:19,002 --> 01:43:20,762
Recruiting young roughs
into the police...

1286
01:43:21,002 --> 01:43:23,922
...proposing will-sapping
techniques of conditioning.

1287
01:43:24,162 --> 01:43:26,322
We've seen it before
in other countries.

1288
01:43:26,562 --> 01:43:27,962
The thin end of the wedge.

1289
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:32,122
Before we know it, we'll have the
full apparatus of totalitarianism.

1290
01:43:36,002 --> 01:43:40,202
This young boy is a living witness
to these diabolical proposals.

1291
01:43:40,442 --> 01:43:44,042
The people, the common people,
must know, must see.

1292
01:43:44,282 --> 01:43:48,482
There are traditions of liberty to
defend. That tradition is all.

1293
01:43:48,722 --> 01:43:50,602
The common people
will let it go, yes.

1294
01:43:50,842 --> 01:43:52,882
They'll sell liberty
for a quieter life.

1295
01:43:53,122 --> 01:43:54,602
That is why they must be led.

1296
01:43:54,842 --> 01:43:56,842
Driven. Pushed.

1297
01:44:01,682 --> 01:44:02,882
Fine.

1298
01:44:03,882 --> 01:44:05,482
Thank you very much, sir.

1299
01:44:07,442 --> 01:44:08,922
He'll be here.

1300
01:44:12,002 --> 01:44:15,162
I'm singing in the rain

1301
01:44:15,922 --> 01:44:18,762
Just singing in the rain

1302
01:44:19,562 --> 01:44:22,602
What a glorious feeling

1303
01:44:22,962 --> 01:44:26,162
I'm hap-hap-happy again

1304
01:44:26,762 --> 01:44:29,762
I'm laughing at clouds

1305
01:44:30,522 --> 01:44:32,962
So dark up above

1306
01:44:33,922 --> 01:44:36,282
The sun's in my heart

1307
01:44:37,082 --> 01:44:40,882
I'm ready for love

1308
01:44:41,762 --> 01:44:44,402
Let the stormy clouds chase

1309
01:44:45,002 --> 01:44:47,722
Everyone from the place

1310
01:44:49,122 --> 01:44:53,922
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

1311
01:44:54,522 --> 01:44:57,402
I'll walk down the lane

1312
01:45:30,202 --> 01:45:31,602
Good evening, sir.

1313
01:45:35,402 --> 01:45:36,882
Good evening.

1314
01:45:37,402 --> 01:45:40,122
It was very kind of you
to leave this out for me.

1315
01:45:40,362 --> 01:45:42,682
There was no one around,
so I started.

1316
01:45:42,922 --> 01:45:44,682
Hope that's all right, sir.

1317
01:45:48,042 --> 01:45:49,682
Of course.

1318
01:46:19,282 --> 01:46:21,562
Food all right?

1319
01:46:27,042 --> 01:46:28,682
Great, sir. Great.

1320
01:46:31,522 --> 01:46:33,682
Try the wine.

1321
01:46:39,802 --> 01:46:41,042
Thank you, sir.

1322
01:46:43,602 --> 01:46:44,802
Cheers.

1323
01:46:46,762 --> 01:46:47,922
Happy days.

1324
01:46:58,002 --> 01:47:00,202
Won't you join me?

1325
01:47:00,922 --> 01:47:03,042
My health doesn't allow it.

1326
01:47:03,842 --> 01:47:05,122
No, thank you.

1327
01:47:10,842 --> 01:47:13,202
" 1960, Chteau...

1328
01:47:13,722 --> 01:47:15,562
...Saint-Estphe.

1329
01:47:15,802 --> 01:47:16,602
Mdoc."

1330
01:47:16,842 --> 01:47:17,762
Very good brand.

1331
01:47:26,122 --> 01:47:27,082
Very good...

1332
01:47:27,322 --> 01:47:28,522
...color, sir.

1333
01:47:32,562 --> 01:47:34,202
Smells nice too.

1334
01:47:48,522 --> 01:47:50,482
Very nice little number.

1335
01:47:51,642 --> 01:47:52,922
Here's to it.

1336
01:48:01,282 --> 01:48:03,722
Very refreshing, sir.
Very refreshing.

1337
01:48:03,962 --> 01:48:06,762
I'm pleased you
appreciate good wine.

1338
01:48:07,842 --> 01:48:09,642
Have another glass.

1339
01:48:22,242 --> 01:48:23,562
My wife...

1340
01:48:24,962 --> 01:48:28,322
...used to do everything for me
and leave me to my writing.

1341
01:48:31,122 --> 01:48:32,722
Your wife? Is she away?

1342
01:48:33,082 --> 01:48:35,322
She's dead!

1343
01:48:39,282 --> 01:48:41,042
I'm sorry to hear about that.

1344
01:48:41,282 --> 01:48:43,562
She was very badly raped, you see.

1345
01:48:43,802 --> 01:48:46,122
We were assaulted by
vicious young hoodlums...

1346
01:48:46,362 --> 01:48:48,602
...in this very room
you're sitting in now.

1347
01:48:48,842 --> 01:48:53,402
I was left a helpless cripple,
but for her the agony was too great.

1348
01:48:53,722 --> 01:48:55,482
The doctors said
it was pneumonia...

1349
01:48:55,722 --> 01:48:58,442
...because it happened later,
during a flu epidemic.

1350
01:48:58,682 --> 01:49:02,762
The doctors told me it was
pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

1351
01:49:03,002 --> 01:49:07,162
A victim of the modern age.
Poor, poor girl!

1352
01:49:11,002 --> 01:49:12,522
And now you.

1353
01:49:13,082 --> 01:49:16,002
Another victim of the modern age.

1354
01:49:16,282 --> 01:49:18,162
But you can be helped.

1355
01:49:19,122 --> 01:49:22,442
I phoned some friends while
you were having your bath.

1356
01:49:22,682 --> 01:49:23,482
Some...

1357
01:49:23,722 --> 01:49:24,762
...friends?

1358
01:49:25,002 --> 01:49:26,482
They want to help you.

1359
01:49:26,722 --> 01:49:28,882
-Help me?
-Help you.

1360
01:49:29,122 --> 01:49:32,482
-Who are they?
-Very, very important people.

1361
01:49:32,722 --> 01:49:35,002
And they're interested in you.

1362
01:49:40,242 --> 01:49:42,322
This'll be these people now.

1363
01:49:42,562 --> 01:49:45,842
I don't want to trouble you
any further. I should be leaving.

1364
01:49:46,882 --> 01:49:48,762
No trouble at all.

1365
01:49:49,442 --> 01:49:50,602
Here.

1366
01:49:50,842 --> 01:49:52,682
Let me fill your glass.

1367
01:50:17,322 --> 01:50:19,002
So this is the young man.

1368
01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:21,722
How do you do, sir?

1369
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:24,602
Missus.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

1370
01:50:24,962 --> 01:50:27,362
I hope you forgive us for coming
at this hour...

1371
01:50:27,602 --> 01:50:29,402
...but we heard you
were in trouble...

1372
01:50:29,642 --> 01:50:31,802
...and so we came over to see
if we could help.

1373
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,202
Very kind of you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1374
01:50:34,442 --> 01:50:36,602
I understand you had a rather...

1375
01:50:36,842 --> 01:50:38,042
...unfortunate...

1376
01:50:38,282 --> 01:50:39,722
...encounter...

1377
01:50:39,962 --> 01:50:41,642
...with the police tonight.

1378
01:50:41,882 --> 01:50:43,882
Yes, I suppose
you could call it that.

1379
01:50:44,122 --> 01:50:45,402
How are you feeling now?

1380
01:50:45,642 --> 01:50:46,842
Much better, thank you.

1381
01:50:47,082 --> 01:50:49,362
Feel like talking,
answering a few questions?

1382
01:50:49,602 --> 01:50:50,882
Fine, sir. Fine.

1383
01:50:51,682 --> 01:50:54,242
As I said, we've heard about you.

1384
01:50:54,722 --> 01:50:57,242
We are interested in your case.

1385
01:50:57,482 --> 01:51:00,242
-We want to help you.
-Thank you very much.

1386
01:51:00,522 --> 01:51:03,522
Shall we get down to it?

1387
01:51:03,762 --> 01:51:05,482
Fine. Fine, sir.

1388
01:51:10,562 --> 01:51:13,202
The newspapers mentioned...

1389
01:51:13,442 --> 01:51:17,562
...in addition to being conditioned
against acts of sex and violence...

1390
01:51:17,802 --> 01:51:21,042
...you've inadvertently been
conditioned against music.

1391
01:51:21,962 --> 01:51:24,922
I think that was something
that they didn't plan for.

1392
01:51:25,242 --> 01:51:27,082
You see, missus...

1393
01:51:27,322 --> 01:51:30,682
...l'm very fond of music.
Especially Beethoven.

1394
01:51:31,762 --> 01:51:33,642
Ludwig van Beethoven.

1395
01:51:33,882 --> 01:51:36,082
-B-E...
-lt's all right, thank you.

1396
01:51:36,602 --> 01:51:40,522
And it just so happened that
while they were showing me...

1397
01:51:40,762 --> 01:51:44,522
...a particularly bad film
of, like, a concentration camp...

1398
01:51:44,762 --> 01:51:48,162
...the background music
was playing Beethoven.

1399
01:51:48,402 --> 01:51:51,042
So now you have
the same reaction to music...

1400
01:51:51,282 --> 01:51:52,962
...as you do to sex and violence?

1401
01:51:53,202 --> 01:51:57,322
No, missus. You see, it's not
all music. It's just the Ninth.

1402
01:51:57,562 --> 01:51:59,242
You mean Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?

1403
01:51:59,482 --> 01:52:02,402
That's right. I can't listen
to the Ninth anymore at all.

1404
01:52:02,642 --> 01:52:05,962
When I hear the Ninth, I get, like...

1405
01:52:06,202 --> 01:52:07,762
...this funny feeling.

1406
01:52:08,762 --> 01:52:12,882
And then all I can think about
is, like, trying to snuff it.

1407
01:52:13,122 --> 01:52:17,362
-I beg your pardon?
-Snuff it. Death, I mean.

1408
01:52:17,602 --> 01:52:20,082
I just want to die peacefully...

1409
01:52:20,522 --> 01:52:22,762
...like, with no pain.

1410
01:52:23,482 --> 01:52:25,282
Do you feel that way now?

1411
01:52:26,402 --> 01:52:28,282
No, sir, not exactly.

1412
01:52:28,522 --> 01:52:29,722
I still feel...

1413
01:52:29,962 --> 01:52:31,162
...very miserable.

1414
01:52:31,402 --> 01:52:33,842
Very much down in spirits.

1415
01:52:34,322 --> 01:52:35,602
Do you still feel...

1416
01:52:35,842 --> 01:52:37,282
...suicidal?

1417
01:52:40,402 --> 01:52:42,082
Put it this way:

1418
01:52:42,362 --> 01:52:45,082
I feel very low in myself.

1419
01:52:45,882 --> 01:52:48,122
I can't see much in the future.

1420
01:52:48,362 --> 01:52:52,642
I feel that any second, something
terrible is going to happen to me.

1421
01:53:05,322 --> 01:53:06,922
Well done, Frank.

1422
01:53:12,722 --> 01:53:14,442
Get the car, would you, please?

1423
01:53:34,202 --> 01:53:35,522
I woke up...

1424
01:53:40,842 --> 01:53:44,442
...the pain and sickness
all over me like an animal.

1425
01:53:52,162 --> 01:53:54,882
Then I realized what it was.

1426
01:53:56,122 --> 01:53:58,802
The music coming up
from the floor...

1427
01:53:59,042 --> 01:54:02,082
... was our old friend,
Ludwig van...

1428
01:54:02,322 --> 01:54:04,882
...and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.

1429
01:54:12,482 --> 01:54:13,802
Let me out!

1430
01:54:14,042 --> 01:54:15,722
Open the door!

1431
01:54:16,402 --> 01:54:18,482
Come on, open the door!

1432
01:54:20,922 --> 01:54:22,162
Turn it off!

1433
01:54:22,402 --> 01:54:24,082
Turn it off!

1434
01:54:30,722 --> 01:54:31,602
Stop it!

1435
01:55:17,882 --> 01:55:19,362
Turn it off!

1436
01:55:20,722 --> 01:55:21,642
Please!

1437
01:55:21,882 --> 01:55:23,962
Turn it off!

1438
01:55:37,322 --> 01:55:40,082
Suddenly, I viddied
what I had to do...

1439
01:55:40,322 --> 01:55:42,562
...and what I had wanted to do.

1440
01:55:42,962 --> 01:55:45,282
And that was to do myself in.

1441
01:55:45,682 --> 01:55:47,002
To snuff it.

1442
01:55:47,322 --> 01:55:50,562
To blast off forever,
out of this wicked, cruel world.

1443
01:55:52,082 --> 01:55:54,402
One moment of pain, perhaps...

1444
01:55:54,682 --> 01:55:56,402
...and then sleep.

1445
01:55:56,642 --> 01:55:59,042
Forever and ever...

1446
01:55:59,282 --> 01:56:00,562
...and ever.

1447
01:56:24,002 --> 01:56:25,722
I jumped, O my brothers...

1448
01:56:25,962 --> 01:56:27,362
...and I fell hard.

1449
01:56:27,602 --> 01:56:29,802
But I did not snuff it.

1450
01:56:30,402 --> 01:56:31,922
If I had snuffed it...

1451
01:56:32,162 --> 01:56:35,322
...I would not be here
to tell what I told have.

1452
01:56:37,162 --> 01:56:41,602
I came back to life
after a long, black, black gap...

1453
01:56:41,842 --> 01:56:45,002
...of what might have been
a million years.

1454
01:57:12,562 --> 01:57:15,002
He's recovered
consciousness, Doctor.

1455
01:57:53,442 --> 01:57:54,882
Hello, lad.

1456
01:57:55,122 --> 01:57:56,642
Hello, son.

1457
01:57:57,562 --> 01:57:58,962
How are you?

1458
01:58:00,042 --> 01:58:01,962
You feeling better?

1459
01:58:06,242 --> 01:58:07,242
What...

1460
01:58:07,482 --> 01:58:08,482
...gives...

1461
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:11,802
...O my Pee and Em?

1462
01:58:12,762 --> 01:58:14,242
What makes...

1463
01:58:15,002 --> 01:58:15,882
...you think...

1464
01:58:16,122 --> 01:58:18,482
...you are welcome?

1465
01:58:21,282 --> 01:58:23,162
There, there, Mother.
It's all right.

1466
01:58:23,402 --> 01:58:24,962
He doesn't mean it.

1467
01:58:27,322 --> 01:58:29,762
You were in the papers again, son.

1468
01:58:30,522 --> 01:58:32,002
It said...

1469
01:58:32,242 --> 01:58:34,882
...they had done
great wrong to you.

1470
01:58:35,722 --> 01:58:37,002
It said...

1471
01:58:37,242 --> 01:58:38,522
...how the government...

1472
01:58:38,762 --> 01:58:40,682
...drove you to try...

1473
01:58:40,922 --> 01:58:42,442
...and do yourself in.

1474
01:58:44,162 --> 01:58:46,362
And when you think about it, son...

1475
01:58:47,402 --> 01:58:49,922
...maybe it was our fault too...

1476
01:58:50,282 --> 01:58:51,482
...in a way.

1477
01:58:52,562 --> 01:58:54,402
Your home's your home...

1478
01:58:54,722 --> 01:58:57,122
...when all's said and done, son.

1479
01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:09,122
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Doctor.

1480
01:59:17,722 --> 01:59:19,882
-How are you feeling today?
-Fine.

1481
01:59:20,122 --> 01:59:21,202
Good. May I?

1482
01:59:21,602 --> 01:59:23,562
-I'm Dr. Taylor.
-Haven't seen you before.

1483
01:59:23,802 --> 01:59:25,042
I'm your psychiatrist.

1484
01:59:25,282 --> 01:59:27,082
Psychiatrist!
Do I need one?

1485
01:59:27,322 --> 01:59:28,762
Just part of hospital routine.

1486
01:59:28,962 --> 01:59:31,042
Are we going to
talk about me sex life?

1487
01:59:32,682 --> 01:59:34,602
I'm going to show you
some slides...

1488
01:59:34,842 --> 01:59:37,562
...and you're going to tell me
what you think about them.

1489
01:59:38,442 --> 01:59:39,282
Jolly good.

1490
01:59:41,322 --> 01:59:42,842
You know anything about dreams?

1491
01:59:43,242 --> 01:59:44,322
Something, yes.

1492
01:59:44,562 --> 01:59:46,242
-You know what they mean?
-Perhaps.

1493
01:59:46,442 --> 01:59:47,842
You concerned about something?

1494
01:59:48,082 --> 01:59:50,962
No, not concerned, really...

1495
01:59:51,202 --> 01:59:53,122
...but I've been having
this nasty dream.

1496
01:59:53,362 --> 01:59:54,762
Very nasty.

1497
01:59:55,002 --> 01:59:56,842
It's like...

1498
01:59:58,762 --> 02:00:00,842
...when I was all smashed up,
you know...

1499
02:00:01,082 --> 02:00:03,042
...and half-awake
and unconscious-like...

1500
02:00:03,282 --> 02:00:05,322
...I kept having this dream.

1501
02:00:05,562 --> 02:00:08,322
All these doctors were
playing around with me gulliver.

1502
02:00:08,562 --> 02:00:10,562
You know, like the inside
of me brain.

1503
02:00:10,802 --> 02:00:13,562
I seem to have this dream
over and over again.

1504
02:00:13,802 --> 02:00:15,842
Do you think it means anything?

1505
02:00:16,722 --> 02:00:20,962
Patients with injuries like yours
often have dreams of this sort.

1506
02:00:21,202 --> 02:00:23,202
It's all part
of the recovery process.

1507
02:00:24,402 --> 02:00:27,082
Now then, each of these slides
needs a reply...

1508
02:00:27,322 --> 02:00:29,242
...from one of the people
in the picture.

1509
02:00:29,482 --> 02:00:32,562
You tell me what you think
the person would say...

1510
02:00:32,802 --> 02:00:33,642
...all right?

1511
02:00:33,882 --> 02:00:35,242
Righty-right.

1512
02:00:37,162 --> 02:00:39,442
"Isn't the plumage beautiful?"

1513
02:00:40,642 --> 02:00:43,002
I just say what the
other person would say?

1514
02:00:47,002 --> 02:00:48,482
Don't think about it too long.

1515
02:00:48,722 --> 02:00:51,122
Say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

1516
02:00:53,682 --> 02:00:55,962
Cabbages. Knickers.

1517
02:00:57,082 --> 02:00:59,282
It's not got a beak.

1518
02:00:59,522 --> 02:01:00,762
Good.

1519
02:01:04,282 --> 02:01:08,042
"The boy you always quarreled with
is seriously ill."

1520
02:01:08,962 --> 02:01:10,642
My mind is a blank...

1521
02:01:11,642 --> 02:01:15,402
...and I'll smash your face
for you, yarblockos.

1522
02:01:15,642 --> 02:01:16,602
Good.

1523
02:01:19,082 --> 02:01:21,082
"What do you want?"

1524
02:01:22,162 --> 02:01:25,402
No time for the old in-out, love.
I've just come to read the meter.

1525
02:01:25,762 --> 02:01:27,082
Good.

1526
02:01:30,402 --> 02:01:33,762
"You sold me a crummy watch.
I want my money back."

1527
02:01:34,242 --> 02:01:37,322
You know what you can do with
that watch? Stick it up your ass!

1528
02:01:41,522 --> 02:01:44,122
"You can do whatever
you like with these."

1529
02:01:45,642 --> 02:01:47,322
Eggiwegs.

1530
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:49,722
I would like...

1531
02:01:49,962 --> 02:01:51,202
...to smash them.

1532
02:01:52,002 --> 02:01:53,202
And pick them all up...

1533
02:01:53,442 --> 02:01:55,002
...and throw...

1534
02:01:55,242 --> 02:01:56,642
Fucking hell!

1535
02:01:57,482 --> 02:01:59,722
There. That's all there is to it.

1536
02:02:00,362 --> 02:02:01,802
Are you all right?

1537
02:02:02,642 --> 02:02:03,922
Hope so.

1538
02:02:04,162 --> 02:02:07,082
Is that the end, then?
I was quite enjoying that.

1539
02:02:07,402 --> 02:02:08,642
Good. I'm glad.

1540
02:02:08,922 --> 02:02:10,002
How many did I get right?

1541
02:02:10,242 --> 02:02:11,962
It's not that kind of a test.

1542
02:02:12,202 --> 02:02:15,402
But you seem well on the way
to making a complete recovery.

1543
02:02:16,002 --> 02:02:17,362
When do I get out, then?

1544
02:02:17,602 --> 02:02:20,082
I'm sure it won't be long now.

1545
02:02:21,442 --> 02:02:22,962
So I waited...

1546
02:02:23,202 --> 02:02:24,642
...and, O my brothers...

1547
02:02:25,002 --> 02:02:26,362
...I got a lot better...

1548
02:02:26,602 --> 02:02:29,722
...munching away at eggiwegs
and lomticks of toast...

1549
02:02:29,962 --> 02:02:32,282
...and lovely steakie-wakes.

1550
02:02:32,522 --> 02:02:33,922
And then one day...

1551
02:02:34,162 --> 02:02:38,162
...they said I was going to have
a very special visitor.

1552
02:02:43,362 --> 02:02:45,962
Just wait outside for a moment,
would you, Officer?

1553
02:02:48,922 --> 02:02:51,002
I'm afraid my change of schedule
has thrown you.

1554
02:02:51,242 --> 02:02:53,402
The patient's in the middle
of supper.

1555
02:02:53,642 --> 02:02:56,362
That's quite all right, Minister.
No trouble at all.

1556
02:02:57,762 --> 02:03:00,642
-Good evening, my boy.
-Hi there, my little droogies.

1557
02:03:00,882 --> 02:03:02,602
How are you getting on, young man?

1558
02:03:02,962 --> 02:03:05,082
Great, sir. Just great.

1559
02:03:05,842 --> 02:03:07,322
Can I do anything more for you?

1560
02:03:07,562 --> 02:03:09,242
I don't think so, Sir Leslie.

1561
02:03:09,482 --> 02:03:12,042
Then I leave you to it.
Nurse!

1562
02:03:14,762 --> 02:03:17,882
You seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

1563
02:03:18,122 --> 02:03:19,362
Yes, sir.

1564
02:03:19,882 --> 02:03:22,122
And a very lonely place
it is too...

1565
02:03:22,362 --> 02:03:24,642
...when I wake up in the night
with me pain.

1566
02:03:26,042 --> 02:03:28,202
Anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

1567
02:03:28,442 --> 02:03:30,922
I kept in touch
with the hospital, of course.

1568
02:03:31,162 --> 02:03:32,922
And now I've come down
personally...

1569
02:03:33,162 --> 02:03:34,682
...to see how you're getting along.

1570
02:03:35,122 --> 02:03:37,282
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned.

1571
02:03:37,522 --> 02:03:38,962
Tortures of the damned.

1572
02:03:39,202 --> 02:03:42,162
Yes, I can appreciate that
you've had an extremely...

1573
02:03:42,402 --> 02:03:45,002
Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

1574
02:03:47,122 --> 02:03:51,202
I can tell you that l, and the
government of which I'm a member...

1575
02:03:51,442 --> 02:03:55,202
...are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

1576
02:03:55,442 --> 02:03:56,642
We tried to help you.

1577
02:03:56,882 --> 02:04:00,802
We followed recommendations
that turned out to be wrong.

1578
02:04:01,162 --> 02:04:04,882
An inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs.

1579
02:04:05,522 --> 02:04:08,602
We want you to regard us
as friends.

1580
02:04:08,842 --> 02:04:10,002
We put you right.

1581
02:04:10,442 --> 02:04:12,242
You're getting
the best of treatment.

1582
02:04:12,482 --> 02:04:14,642
We never wished you harm.

1583
02:04:14,922 --> 02:04:17,482
But there are some who did, and do.

1584
02:04:17,962 --> 02:04:20,522
And I think you know who those are.

1585
02:04:21,082 --> 02:04:24,722
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

1586
02:04:24,962 --> 02:04:27,202
They would have been
glad to have you dead...

1587
02:04:27,442 --> 02:04:30,482
...for they thought they could then
blame it on the government.

1588
02:04:31,042 --> 02:04:33,282
There is also a certain man...

1589
02:04:33,522 --> 02:04:35,922
...a writer of subversive
literature...

1590
02:04:36,162 --> 02:04:38,162
...who has been howling
for your blood.

1591
02:04:38,402 --> 02:04:41,682
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

1592
02:04:42,082 --> 02:04:43,562
But you're safe from him now.

1593
02:04:43,802 --> 02:04:45,762
We put him away.

1594
02:04:47,602 --> 02:04:50,562
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

1595
02:04:51,082 --> 02:04:53,442
At least he believed
you had done wrong.

1596
02:04:53,682 --> 02:04:57,722
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible...

1597
02:04:57,962 --> 02:05:01,242
...for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

1598
02:05:02,082 --> 02:05:03,122
He was a menace.

1599
02:05:03,362 --> 02:05:05,402
We put him away
for his own protection.

1600
02:05:05,602 --> 02:05:06,882
And also for yours.

1601
02:05:07,642 --> 02:05:08,962
Where is he now?

1602
02:05:09,202 --> 02:05:12,522
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

1603
02:05:12,762 --> 02:05:15,722
You see, we are looking
after your interests.

1604
02:05:15,962 --> 02:05:17,962
We are interested in you.

1605
02:05:18,642 --> 02:05:21,562
When you leave, you'll have no
worries. We'll see to everything.

1606
02:05:21,802 --> 02:05:23,842
A good job on a good salary.

1607
02:05:24,082 --> 02:05:25,722
What job and how much?

1608
02:05:26,562 --> 02:05:30,362
You'll have an interesting job at
a salary you regard as adequate.

1609
02:05:30,602 --> 02:05:32,722
Not only for the job
you're going to do...

1610
02:05:32,962 --> 02:05:36,442
...and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered...

1611
02:05:36,682 --> 02:05:40,162
...but also because
you are helping us.

1612
02:05:41,402 --> 02:05:42,882
Helping you?

1613
02:05:43,122 --> 02:05:46,122
We always help our friends,
don't we?

1614
02:05:52,402 --> 02:05:54,522
It is no secret
that this government...

1615
02:05:54,762 --> 02:05:57,802
...has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

1616
02:05:58,042 --> 02:06:01,282
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

1617
02:06:01,522 --> 02:06:04,122
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view...

1618
02:06:04,362 --> 02:06:05,722
...of what we tried to do.

1619
02:06:06,642 --> 02:06:09,802
But public opinion
has a way of changing.

1620
02:06:10,042 --> 02:06:11,682
And you, Alex...

1621
02:06:11,922 --> 02:06:13,682
...if I may call you Alex...

1622
02:06:13,922 --> 02:06:17,082
Certainly.
What do they call you at home?

1623
02:06:18,362 --> 02:06:19,602
My name is Frederick.

1624
02:06:20,522 --> 02:06:22,282
As I was saying, Alex...

1625
02:06:22,522 --> 02:06:27,202
...you can be instrumental
in changing the public's verdict.

1626
02:06:30,402 --> 02:06:32,322
Do you understand, Alex?

1627
02:06:33,202 --> 02:06:35,322
Do I make myself clear?

1628
02:06:38,162 --> 02:06:40,362
As an unmuddied lake, Fred.

1629
02:06:40,882 --> 02:06:44,122
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

1630
02:06:44,362 --> 02:06:45,722
You can rely on me, Fred.

1631
02:06:45,962 --> 02:06:47,242
Good.

1632
02:06:47,482 --> 02:06:48,882
Good boy.

1633
02:06:49,882 --> 02:06:51,642
I understand you're fond of music.

1634
02:06:51,882 --> 02:06:54,002
I have arranged a little
surprise for you.

1635
02:06:54,282 --> 02:06:55,642
Surprise?

1636
02:06:55,882 --> 02:06:57,522
One that I hope
that you will like...

1637
02:06:57,762 --> 02:06:59,082
...as a...

1638
02:06:59,882 --> 02:07:01,202
...how shall we put it...

1639
02:07:01,442 --> 02:07:04,522
...as a symbol of
our new understanding.

1640
02:07:05,482 --> 02:07:08,642
An understanding
between two friends.

1641
02:08:25,402 --> 02:08:27,922
I was cured, all right!
