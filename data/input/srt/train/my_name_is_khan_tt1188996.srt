1
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:54,643
Would you please come with me, Sir?

2
00:04:57,803 --> 00:04:59,483
Would you come with me, Sir?

3
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,845
Hands in front.

4
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,285
Hands behind your head.

5
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:31,045
Behind your head and turn around.

6
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:33,246
Open your mouth. Open your mouth.

7
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,767
Anything on the watch-list, George?

8
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:52,887
No flags. He's clean.

9
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:58,287
Okay. Mr. Khan, we are done here.

10
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,647
You can go.

11
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:04,608
Put your stuff in your bag.

12
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:08,608
Gone. It's gone.. my last flight
to Washington DC has left.

13
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,408
The last American
Airlines flight has left.

14
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:14,248
The next flight leaves after
seven hours and five minutes.

15
00:06:14,327 --> 00:06:17,248
United 59. United.. United 59.

16
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:22,649
It leaves in the morning at 6.10.
Ticket $366.. it costs $366.

17
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:25,409
I don't have the money.

18
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:27,449
I have to take a bus
to Washington DC now.

19
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:30,609
Okay. I have to take a
bus to Washington DC now.

20
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,729
Why are you going to Washington DC?

21
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:36,490
I am going to meet the
President of the United States.

22
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,850
Why is that?
Is he a friend of yours?

23
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,090
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He's not a friend. No, no, no.

24
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,130
I have something to say to him.

25
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,810
Oh yeah?
- Yes.

26
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,171
Well, tell the President
something from me too then.

27
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:57,771
Okay. Okay.
- Tell him I said, howdy.

28
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,611
Howdy? How.. Okay.

29
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,811
Pen?

30
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,892
J. Marshall.

31
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:10,292
John.
- John.

32
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,652
John.
- John. John Marshall says howdy.

33
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,252
Howdy. Okay. Howdy.

34
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:18,812
Yes. Okay. Okay.
John Marshall says..

35
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:21,853
But I have.. my own
message to give to him first.

36
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,653
Oh yeah? What is that?

37
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,013
You know where Osama is?

38
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:29,453
Oh, no, no, no, no. No.
This is not my message. No, no, no.

39
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:32,653
What is your message, Mr. Khan?

40
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,053
I have to say to him..

41
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:40,374
My name is Khan. And
I am not a terrorist.

42
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:39,017
May Allah bless this
letter I知 writing to you.

43
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:41,778
The book 'Different Minds' says..

44
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:45,138
..that people like us can't
express their emotions in words.

45
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:47,818
But we can write them easily.

46
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,898
I can fill thousands of pages,
millions of times with..

47
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:52,738
'I love you, Mandira'

48
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:55,298
But not once could I say it to you.

49
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:57,379
Perhaps that's why
you are angry with me.

50
00:08:57,498 --> 00:09:01,019
I had promised you that
I would meet the President..

51
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:02,739
..so, my attempts are on.

52
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:06,619
Meanwhile whenever I have time,
I will write all..

53
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:08,899
..that I couldn't say to you.

54
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:13,260
And then, you will love me again.

55
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,540
My Abbu (father) Dilawar
Amanullah Khan worked for..

56
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:25,660
..the S.T. workshop in Borivali.

57
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,501
He took me with him
to work everyday.

58
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:30,581
And left me to play in the garage.

59
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:34,301
I know how to repair
broken things since then.

60
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,821
Strangely, I could
never repair Abbu.

61
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,221
Hey, is this your dad's place?

62
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,901
Go home and kill your time.

63
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:44,342
Kill? Kill?

64
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:46,302
Get out now! Out!

65
00:09:56,341 --> 00:10:00,663
You fool! Idiot! Ruined my clothes!

66
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:10,703
Ammi (mother) .. Ammi.. Ammi..

67
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:12,703
Zakir is sleeping.

68
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:14,303
What's this?

69
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:16,504
'Kill time'
- How did you get so wet?

70
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:18,024
'Kill time', I want to 'kill time'
- What?

71
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,744
Abdul Workshop asked me to
go home and 'kill time'

72
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:22,704
How do I do that?

73
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:23,944
'Kill time? '

74
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:27,864
Is that what the devil told you?

75
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:30,425
Okay. I値l teach you
how to 'kill time'

76
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,145
Like this. Like this.

77
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,745
This way.

78
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:46,706
Come on, Rizu.

79
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:49,426
Give me a hug.. just once?

80
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,666
Come on. Come on.

81
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:57,866
My Ammi (mother) Razia Khan.

82
00:10:57,946 --> 00:11:00,746
I feel peace when you hug me.

83
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,267
She was from Jalalpur, UP.

84
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:05,867
She embroidered clothes.

85
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:10,027
No doctor could tell her
why I was the way I was.

86
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:13,147
But Ammi (mother).. She never
felt the need to know why.

87
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,787
I don't know how, but
she found a way to know me.

88
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,548
Just like you.

89
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,588
Fools! All of them!!

90
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:27,188
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly!

91
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:28,948
Didn't even spare our women!

92
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:31,668
Dogs! Rogues! Idiots!

93
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,349
Are you guys with me?

94
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,189
Rogues. All of them.

95
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:37,949
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly.

96
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,589
I had told you not to step out.

97
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:44,429
Now, come on. Let's eat.

98
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,549
Rogues. All of them.

99
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:50,270
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly.

100
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,150
Rogues. All of them.

101
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:53,430
What did you say?

102
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,790
Rogues. All of them.

103
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:55,950
Where did you hear that?

104
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,150
Each one of them
should be shot dead.

105
00:11:57,229 --> 00:11:58,310
Shut up!

106
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,630
Rogues. All of them.

107
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,630
Shut up, Rizu.

108
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,910
Come with me. Come.

109
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:05,311
Look at this.

110
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:10,631
This is you. Rizvan. Who?

111
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,551
Rizvan.
- Yes.

112
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:17,591
And this is the person who
has a stick in his hand.

113
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,511
And he is beating you.

114
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,512
It's bad.. beating is bad.
- Yes. It's bad.

115
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:25,192
Now, this is you again, Rizvan.

116
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:30,912
And this is the
person who has a lollipop.

117
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,072
And he gives it to you.

118
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,312
Lollipop is sweet.
It's a good thing.

119
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:35,993
Good boy.
- Good boy.

120
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:40,553
Now, tell me which one of these is
a Hindu and which one, a Muslim?

121
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:46,753
Both look alike.

122
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:48,473
Good.

123
00:12:49,913 --> 00:12:51,994
Remember one thing, son.

124
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:55,554
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

125
00:12:56,914 --> 00:13:00,434
Good people who do good deeds.

126
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:03,154
And bad people who do bad.

127
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:06,674
That's the only
difference in human beings.

128
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:09,435
There's no other difference.
Understood?

129
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:13,315
What did you understand?
Tell me. Tell me.

130
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:17,955
Good people. Bad people.
No other difference.

131
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:22,115
Ammi's (mother) lesson was not
taught in any school.

132
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:25,396
Not in my school at least.

133
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:40,797
Master Wadia lives somewhere here.

134
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:42,397
Give me the map.

135
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,677
Come fast.

136
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:52,637
Rizu, what are you doing?
Stop that and come here.

137
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:58,678
Hang on. Coming.

138
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:03,438
Hello. I知 Razia. This
is Rizu. I mean Rizvan.

139
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:05,718
I have heard a lot about you.

140
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:08,398
That you are a very learned man.
You have a lot of degrees.

141
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:09,879
B.A., M.A.

142
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,239
Whatever!

143
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,999
But people say you don't do anything.
That's a good thing!

144
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,719
Rizu. My Rizu is a sharp boy.

145
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:27,480
So, I thought if you agree to
teach him here, in your house

146
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,520
That way, you can pass
your time too, isn't it?

147
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,000
What nonsense!

148
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,640
Mr. Wadia. Mr. Wadia. Trust me.

149
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,360
My Rizu is an intelligent boy.

150
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,881
Rizu.. Talk to Mr. Wadia in English.

151
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,241
Speak in English. Come on.

152
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,761
Say something in English.

153
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,161
Wadia. Wadia.

154
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:50,041
Wadia family is a Parsi
family originally based in Surat.

155
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,641
Launji Narsolaunji Wadia started the
Wadia ship building dynasty in 1 736.

156
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:58,562
When he obtained a contract from
the British East India Company..

157
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:00,642
..for building docks
and ships in Bombay.

158
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:03,522
Wadia. Wadia.

159
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:07,042
The highway man came riding..

160
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:10,682
..riding up to the old Inn-door.

161
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:16,843
The highway man came
riding up to the old Inn-door.

162
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:26,643
Ammi.. I知 hungry.
Let's go. I知 hungry.

163
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:30,044
Ammi (mother) said master
Wadia was a good man.

164
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:33,764
Good people did good deeds.

165
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:37,164
Master Wadia taught
me a lot of things.

166
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:40,404
About books. And about life too.

167
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:47,045
Rizvan. Rizvan, don't come here.

168
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:50,685
There's too much water.
Go home! Go home!

169
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:57,085
Mr. Wadia. What are you doing?

170
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,485
Come out!

171
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:01,566
Your pupil is amazing!

172
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:06,326
What's going on? Why
are you guys screaming?

173
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:11,766
Rizvan, what are you doing?
I asked you to go home.

174
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,527
Too good.

175
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:24,647
You are pumping water out.

176
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:27,647
That's amazing. Genius. Genius.

177
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,328
He is my pupil. My pupil.

178
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:48,649
You think he can repair all this?

179
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:50,489
You know, Mr. Wadia?

180
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:55,209
My Rizu did nothing short of
a miracle near his house.

181
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:56,729
The water had filled till here.
- Mother!

182
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:57,969
One minute!

183
00:16:58,048 --> 00:16:59,169
The water was till here.

184
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:01,129
Rizu fixed some motor type of thing.

185
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:02,330
One minute!

186
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:04,250
Put the motor in the water,
and the water was gone!

187
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,690
I saw it with my own eyes.

188
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:07,410
Really?
- Yes.

189
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:13,290
Zakir.

190
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,530
You won a cup, didn't you?

191
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,291
I知 really happy about that.

192
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:20,611
And Rizu?

193
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,411
Even he is happy for you.

194
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,851
You should be happy too.

195
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,851
He is your brother, isn't he?

196
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:31,491
Good boy. Wipe your tears.

197
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,891
Come on.

198
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:35,892
You are my good son, aren't you?

199
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,532
You are my good son, aren't you?

200
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:40,492
You are my good son, aren't you?

201
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:43,052
You are my good son, aren't you?

202
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:47,372
Zakir was fortunate.

203
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:49,893
He could cry.

204
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:56,053
Zakir, Rizu says it's
going to be very cold there.

205
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:59,213
You have taken everything,
right? Don't forget anything.

206
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:02,373
I will miss you, my son.

207
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,813
Only if you find time from
bhai (brother) will you miss me!

208
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:16,134
As soon as he completed 18 years,
Zakir left for America.

209
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:19,934
He got a scholarship
at Michigan University.

210
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:25,735
I felt very bad when he left.

211
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,095
But I never told him.

212
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:33,615
And in just a few days,
I got accustomed to his absence.

213
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:36,616
Ammi (mother). Hasina teaches
at the university.

214
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,696
She can't leave mid-term and come.

215
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:44,536
It's her first Eid (festival)
in the family after the wedding.

216
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:50,056
We haven't even seen her yet.
Come here, please.

217
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:51,936
Ammi (mother).

218
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:53,817
Don't worry.

219
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:56,057
Your immigration will
be done in a few days.

220
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,257
Then you will live with us.

221
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:04,457
I won't go anywhere without Rizvan.

222
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:07,577
I know that.

223
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:10,618
I知 sponsoring bhai (brother) as well.

224
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:15,498
Okay, Ammi (mother). I have to hang
up now. I値l call later.

225
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:17,338
Yeah?

226
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,339
Oh, Lord.
- Oh, lord.

227
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,540
Ammi (mother), you should sleep now.

228
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:46,340
Sleeping calms the mind and
provides rest to the body.

229
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,940
Shut up!

230
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,380
Nothing is wrong with me.

231
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,060
Just missing Zakir, that's all.

232
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,021
His laughter.

233
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:57,981
His anger.

234
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,221
The sound of his gargling.

235
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,701
At 7am. At 2pm. 9pm.

236
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,143
Enough peace?

237
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:35,303
Please, Rizu. Two minutes?
Only two minutes.

238
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,543
Only two minutes?

239
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,624
1001 , 1002.

240
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:50,024
But Mandira, the effect
of those two minutes..

241
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:54,864
..lasted only for six months,
four days and 1 7 hours.

242
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:09,985
Ammi (mother) died of
congestive cardiomyopathy.

243
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:13,986
Her heart became too
big for its own good.

244
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,626
Before dying, Ammi (mother) made me promise..

245
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:30,187
..that like Zakir, I would
make a happy life for myself.

246
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:34,787
That I would go to America.

247
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:52,028
And then I came here..

248
00:21:52,107 --> 00:21:55,868
..to your favorite city.
San Francisco.

249
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:04,109
And it was scary. very scary.

250
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,670
Bhai (brother), this is Hasina.

251
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,070
Hello, bhai (brother).

252
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:33,071
How are you?

253
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:38,191
Hope your flight was comfortable.

254
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,591
Hello.

255
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:42,711
Come on. Let's go in.

256
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:45,111
Hello to you too.

257
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,192
Zakir's wife, Hasina.

258
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:52,152
She was from Brooklyn, New York.

259
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:55,592
She taught psychology
in the university here.

260
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:59,792
She was the first to find out..

261
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:13,593
..that I had Asperger's Syndrome.

262
00:23:15,112 --> 00:23:19,034
My fear of new places. New people.

263
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:24,394
My hatred for the colour
yellow and sharp sounds.

264
00:23:26,714 --> 00:23:30,034
The reason for me
being so different..

265
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:33,274
..from everyone was
defined in just two words..

266
00:23:33,754 --> 00:23:36,435
..Asperger's Syndrome.

267
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:39,715
Take this.

268
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:40,955
When you look through this..

269
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:42,795
..it will be like watching TV.

270
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:44,075
_?

271
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:46,875
This way, you won't be
scared of new places or roads.

272
00:23:46,955 --> 00:23:48,035
Not scared?

273
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:51,116
No. Just press this button.
See.. TV ?

274
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,556
I took bhai (brother) to the Autistic Society.

275
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:01,676
Hi, Mrs. Brennan.
- Hi.

276
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:03,756
Sorry.
- I had.

277
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:06,237
Mrs. Brennan there
believes that bhai (brother) is better..

278
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:08,677
..than most people with Asperger's.

279
00:24:09,397 --> 00:24:13,117
Maybe in odd ways, but at
Least he can express his feelings.

280
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:16,797
And I think your Ammi (mother) had
a lot to with it, Zakir.

281
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:24,398
Good morning.
- Good morning.

282
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:25,998
This is our office.

283
00:24:26,077 --> 00:24:27,638
Come in. Have a good look.

284
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:28,878
Have a good look.

285
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,798
What are you doing? Come this way.

286
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:33,198
What did I have when
I came to America?

287
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:35,078
Nothing. But today?

288
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:36,838
See for yourself.

289
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:39,479
I am the biggest dealer
for Mehnaz Herbal Products.

290
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:43,919
Because this is America.
- America.

291
00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:46,359
Here, the harder you work,
the more successful you get.

292
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:47,119
America.

293
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,599
I have worked very hard.
Now, it's your turn.

294
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,799
America.
- Okay?

295
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:52,159
Shall we? Come.

296
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,160
Not that way. This way

297
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,000
America.

298
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,160
Come. These are all our products
and these are the details.

299
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,600
You will be given the names
and addresses of all the salons.

300
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,440
You will go to every one of
them and sell these. Understand?

301
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,400
No.

302
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,761
You will.

303
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,761
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.

304
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,441
Mehnaz..

305
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:27,922
The rose water in the clay mask
cleans and clarifies your skin..

306
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:31,682
..and makes you glow
like a newly-wed bride.

307
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:35,242
A newly-wed bride.

308
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:43,723
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.
All of them.

309
00:25:43,802 --> 00:25:48,803
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products will
make you glow like a newly-wed bride.

310
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,603
I知 divorced.

311
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:54,003
We have nothing for
the newly-divorced.

312
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:56,044
Just a pimple cream won't help.

313
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:59,444
You need to cleanse your face,
and your system.

314
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,324
I think that maybe I
just need a boyfriend.

315
00:26:02,404 --> 00:26:04,924
Oh, no, no. You
don't need a boyfriend.

316
00:26:05,004 --> 00:26:08,124
You need this and Jamal Gota.

317
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:09,764
Indian laxative.

318
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:14,045
It says that the product
will reach you in seven days.

319
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:15,205
We're lying.

320
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,485
It will reach you only in ten days.

321
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:24,289
Move!

322
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:33,490
Come on! Move it!

323
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,610
Come on. Get out of
the way, you freak.

324
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:39,890
No, no, no.

325
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,130
Get out of here. Come on.

326
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,371
Hey, you guys, just leave him alone.

327
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:46,531
Stop it.

328
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,691
Stop it, okay? Just go.

329
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,171
Go, please.

330
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,971
Are you okay?

331
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:56,771
Are you scared?

332
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:58,771
It's okay.

333
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,092
Look, there's nothing
wrong with being scared.

334
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:03,812
Just don't make your fear so large..

335
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,332
..that it stops you
from achieving your goal.

336
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:07,532
Okay? All right, bye.

337
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:48,895
Hello. Welcome to Karma.

338
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,415
I知 the manager here.

339
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,855
Can I help you?

340
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:55,175
Oh God.

341
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:57,735
I think you have recognized me.

342
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:00,135
It's all right. Don't be shy.

343
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,015
I am Rita Singh. Ex Miss India.

344
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:05,136
These blow-dyers..

345
00:29:05,216 --> 00:29:07,936
I am Rita Singh. Ex Miss India.

346
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:12,456
You look old. You must have
been Miss India before I was born.

347
00:29:12,536 --> 00:29:13,776
Okay?

348
00:29:19,576 --> 00:29:22,297
The theory of entrainment
in Physics states that..

349
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:28,257
..some specific sounds increase
the rate of your heartbeat.

350
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:36,058
For me, Mandira..

351
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:41,338
..that specific sound has always
been the sound of your laughter.

352
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:45,218
So, you were coming here?

353
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:46,818
Don't take it personally, Rita.

354
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:49,378
I hope you've come for a haircut.

355
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:51,699
You have got great hair.
- Okay.

356
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:53,179
Okay.
- Okay.

357
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,099
Take an appointment.

358
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:58,299
My name is Rizvan Khan. Khan. Khan.

359
00:29:58,818 --> 00:30:01,539
I may look a little strange to you..

360
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:04,179
..but that's because
I have Asperger's Syndrome.

361
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:07,620
It's named after Dr. Hans Asperger.

362
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:10,740
That doesn't mean I知 mad.

363
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:12,540
Oh, no, no, no, no.

364
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:14,460
I知 very intelligent.

365
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,700
very smart. very smart.

366
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,580
But there are certain
things I don't understand.

367
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:24,101
For instance, people say when I go
to their houses, ''Come, Rizvan..

368
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:25,741
..think of it as your own house.''

369
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,901
But how do I do that..

370
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:28,661
..when the house isn't mine?

371
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:32,261
I don't understand why people
say one thing and think another.

372
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,461
My Ammi (mother) would say there are only
two kinds of people in the world.

373
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,621
Good people and bad people.

374
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:39,062
I知 a good person.

375
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,302
I do good deeds.

376
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,102
I知 here to sell Mehnaz
Herbal Beauty products.

377
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:45,542
I don't know how to sell.

378
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:48,742
But my brother Zakir
tells me that's my job.

379
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:51,022
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty products.

380
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:52,702
..they are good products.

381
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:54,943
I have tried them all on me.

382
00:30:55,023 --> 00:30:57,943
That's why my skin glows.

383
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,383
Shinning like a newly-wed bride.

384
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,223
Allow me.. Allow me to show you..

385
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:07,983
..all the Mehnaz Herbal
Beauty products, please.

386
00:31:09,663 --> 00:31:10,984
May I?

387
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,904
Yes, you can.

388
00:31:13,343 --> 00:31:14,464
So tell me.

389
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:16,184
Which product will
make me beautiful?

390
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:17,424
No.

391
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,344
No product can make you beautiful.

392
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:21,984
That's rude.
- No, no.

393
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:25,625
Beauty products can
only enhance the skin.

394
00:31:26,064 --> 00:31:27,625
They cannot make you beautiful.

395
00:31:27,705 --> 00:31:28,865
Wow.

396
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:30,025
A salesman, and yet
you speak the truth?

397
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:31,865
Always. Always.

398
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:33,905
How many products do you have?

399
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:35,905
22. 22.

400
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:37,065
Give six of each.

401
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:38,825
Oh no, no, no. No.

402
00:31:38,904 --> 00:31:42,266
All our products expire
in three months. It dies.

403
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:44,146
You need only four.

404
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:46,226
The rest will get spoilt.

405
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:49,466
What did you say the name was?

406
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:53,346
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.

407
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:54,666
Your name?

408
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:57,427
Rizvan Khan.

409
00:31:57,507 --> 00:31:58,587
Khan.

410
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:02,547
I知 Mandira.
- Mandira.

411
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:05,067
Hi.
- Hi.

412
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:08,747
Hi.

413
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:10,907
Hi.

414
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:33,593
Isn't this shocking pink
a little too shocking?

415
00:33:33,672 --> 00:33:35,833
Not at all! It looks beautiful!

416
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:37,273
Pink is so your colour.

417
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:38,433
Really?
- Yeah.

418
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:39,633
I agree.

419
00:33:43,993 --> 00:33:46,394
Hello. Hello.

420
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:48,914
Hi. Nice colour.

421
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,554
Oh yes. Pink is so my colour.

422
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:54,194
Oh no, no, no. No cell phone.
No cell phone.

423
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:55,154
Why?

424
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,674
Because bees die due to cell phones.

425
00:33:56,754 --> 00:33:57,674
Who?!

426
00:33:57,754 --> 00:33:58,634
Bees. Bees. Bees.

427
00:33:58,714 --> 00:34:02,315
Cell phone signals cause bees to
lose their way home, and they die.

428
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:03,835
They die. They die.

429
00:34:03,914 --> 00:34:04,915
It's not good.

430
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:06,235
Because Albert Einstein has said..

431
00:34:06,314 --> 00:34:08,235
Albert Einstein has apparently said.

432
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:08,955
Apparently said..

433
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:11,195
That if all the bees
in the world die..

434
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:13,195
..exactly four years
after that all men will die.

435
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:14,155
That's right. That's right.

436
00:34:14,234 --> 00:34:16,435
All men die. All men die.

437
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:19,796
Oh no. No cell phones then. If all
the men die, what will happen to me?

438
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:21,436
You're bad.

439
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:25,276
This cream has an extra
care skin nourishing lotion..

440
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:28,596
..which contains Aloe Vera,
Calamine and Jojoba oil..

441
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:32,716
..which restore the
pH scale of the skin.

442
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:37,557
The pH is an algorithm of
the activity of hydrogen ions..

443
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:39,157
..in a solution..

444
00:34:39,236 --> 00:34:41,677
..which tells you how
acidic or basic it is.

445
00:34:41,756 --> 00:34:43,837
The exponentials of
hydrogen ions being very high..

446
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,317
..it's not practical to measure it.

447
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:49,838
It's not an absolute term,
it's just a relative.

448
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:57,118
Basically it means..
this cream is very nice.

449
00:34:57,757 --> 00:34:59,518
Okay.
- Okay.

450
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:04,358
I値l take it.
- Okay.

451
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:57,282
I trained for a year and then
took a further course in LA.

452
00:35:57,362 --> 00:35:59,282
I mean.. But I did want to make it.

453
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:00,922
I think training is really important.

454
00:36:01,002 --> 00:36:02,282
How can you cut
somebody's hair without it?

455
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:03,682
And that's how I came here.

456
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,882
You?

457
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,882
Were you saying something to me?

458
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:09,283
And I think you know the most
we know the most we can do is..

459
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:11,603
..just texturise it a
little bit, thin it out. And..

460
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:13,883
Even I want to have my
hair cut by you, Mandira.

461
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:16,603
Yeah. I know, Rizvan. But..

462
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:19,043
Please, please. Please
cut my hair. Please.

463
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:20,483
Yeah. And I am dying
to cut your hair.

464
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:23,003
No, no, no, no. Don't die.
- But maybe later?

465
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,764
No, don't die.
Just cut my hair now.

466
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:26,764
Rizvan..
- No, now.

467
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,646
So? How is it?

468
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:08,846
Marry me.

469
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:11,487
Marry me.

470
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,087
Liked it so much?!

471
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:15,007
Hang on. One second.

472
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,167
Marry me.
- Excuse me.

473
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:17,567
Hello?

474
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:19,527
Sameer. Hi.

475
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:20,447
Reached home?

476
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:22,127
Okay. Okay, I知 coming.

477
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,847
Bye. Love you.

478
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,648
Sameer?

479
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:30,848
Sameer! Sameer! Sam!

480
00:37:30,928 --> 00:37:33,088
Come on. Please, hurry up.
- Coming!

481
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:36,848
Quickly. Come on! Come on! Come on!

482
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:38,848
You put everything into the bag?
- Yup.

483
00:37:38,928 --> 00:37:40,608
Summer camp project?
- Yup.

484
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:42,089
Lunch.
- Yup.

485
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:43,409
Soccer gear?

486
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:44,769
I think I forgot.

487
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,729
Mom, stop acting. You
forgot deliberately.

488
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,249
Do you have to play soccer?
It's dangerous.

489
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:50,409
What if you get hurt playing?

490
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:51,849
What if I get hurt
running this way with you?

491
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:53,009
Nothing will happen to you here.

492
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:54,889
I知 here. Your Mom!

493
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:56,089
Mom, stop being so dramatic.

494
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:57,530
You are such a drama queen.

495
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,930
Yeah, I am.

496
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,690
Okay. Almost there.
Almost there. Almost there.

497
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:03,610
Thank God. We are on time.

498
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:05,170
Okay. Bye, Mom.

499
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:07,250
Where's my hug? Where's my kiss?

500
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,090
Stop it, Mom. I have got reputation.

501
00:38:09,169 --> 00:38:10,250
Reputation.

502
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,730
Bye!
- Bye!

503
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:15,091
Bye! The apple of my eye.
Love me till I die..

504
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,451
Bye!

505
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:20,971
Oh God. Oh shit.

506
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:27,891
Hey, Rizvan. Hi.

507
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,092
Hi. Any sales appointment?

508
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:31,372
You are divorced.

509
00:38:31,452 --> 00:38:32,572
Divorced.

510
00:38:32,651 --> 00:38:34,492
Rita told me you are divorced.

511
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:37,772
You were 19 when you
had an arranged marriage.

512
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:39,332
You came to America
with your husband.

513
00:38:39,412 --> 00:38:40,612
He harassed you a
lot for three years..

514
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:42,532
..and then left for
Australia with another woman.

515
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,293
It must take a long time to
run till Australia, right?

516
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:48,013
He divorced you from there and
didn't even pay you alimony.

517
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:51,173
Such a beast! Slimy! Idiot!

518
00:38:51,252 --> 00:38:52,693
He hasn't called you even
once in the last four years.

519
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:54,493
Hasn't even spoken to Sam.

520
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:56,093
Now, where is he going
to come back..

521
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:57,613
Slimy bastard, mother..

522
00:38:57,772 --> 00:38:58,973
Mother..

523
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:02,174
..I can't say the next word.

524
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,614
You have said enough.

525
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:06,414
Thank you.
- Welcome.

526
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,774
Marry me.
- Just go.

527
00:39:10,854 --> 00:39:12,574
Marry me.
- Just go, okay?

528
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:13,734
Marry me.

529
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:23,855
Okay.

530
00:39:27,254 --> 00:39:28,335
Mandira..
- No, Rita.

531
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:29,615
No more appointments tomorrow!

532
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:31,616
Mrs. V is coming tomorrow and
her hair colouring takes time.

533
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:32,856
Okay. Bye.

534
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:36,976
Bye.
- Bye, girl.

535
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:48,097
Rizvan, are you okay?

536
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:53,697
No!
- What? Rizvan!

537
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,177
Please..
- No..

538
00:39:56,256 --> 00:39:58,177
What happened?!

539
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:10,618
Hi.

540
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:12,098
You run fast.

541
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:17,658
I don't like yellow.

542
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,059
Okay.
- No.

543
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:20,619
Is that for me?

544
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:22,499
Yes. This and this.

545
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,459
But I won't give it to you.

546
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:25,179
Why?!
- No.

547
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:26,859
I love balloons.
- No, no, no, no.

548
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:28,579
In fact, Sam loves balloons.
- No.

549
00:40:28,658 --> 00:40:31,099
Whenever he sees them, he
wants to set them free in the sky.

550
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,900
Red, blue, pink, green..
these colours look good on you.

551
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,860
Yellow, yellow, dirty fellow.

552
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,060
Yellow, yellow, dirty fellow.

553
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:40,220
Okay.
- Okay.

554
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,700
sorry.
- sorry.

555
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,740
Can we go now?
- Okay. - It's cold.

556
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,900
Okay?
- Okay.

557
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,380
Let's go.

558
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:52,381
Look. I知 sorry I was angry.

559
00:40:52,861 --> 00:40:56,821
Your words reminded me of
all that I wanted to forget.

560
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:58,701
He really was a..

561
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,941
..beast. Slimy. Idiot.
- Yeah.

562
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:03,261
Slimy. Idiot and all that.

563
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:05,422
So, you don't love him?

564
00:41:05,582 --> 00:41:07,982
No. No, no. Of course not.

565
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:12,542
Not that, but I feel bad that
Sam will never know his father.

566
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:14,182
lf you don't love him, marry me.

567
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:17,422
Marriage is not a joke.

568
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:18,822
You know. You don't even know me.

569
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:20,182
I know you well.

570
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:21,943
You give fruit to
Roger the homeless.

571
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:24,183
You cut hair. You do
good deeds. You are good.

572
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:25,623
You're okay. - Knowing
just that is not good enough.

573
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:26,423
Yes. Yes. It's enough for me.

574
00:41:26,503 --> 00:41:26,943
Marry me.

575
00:41:27,023 --> 00:41:29,783
It's.. - Marry me. - Oh,
God. I want to kill myself.

576
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:31,623
Marry me. - I知 fed up.. - Oh, no,
no, no, no, no. Don't kill yourself.

577
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:32,983
Oh, no, don't kill yourself.

578
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:35,383
Don't die. Please, don't die.
- I知 joking.

579
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:37,384
Please don't die.
- I was joking. - Please don't die.

580
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:39,024
Relax, I知 joking.
- Please don't die.

581
00:41:39,103 --> 00:41:40,184
I don't understand..

582
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:41,504
Mandira. Mandira.
- I was joking..

583
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:42,784
Cable car. 1873.

584
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:46,664
The first cable car was
started in San Francisco in 1873.

585
00:41:47,143 --> 00:41:50,824
1873. - You know you're ridiculous.
You're just ridiculous.

586
00:41:51,223 --> 00:41:51,824
I mean..

587
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:54,065
Either you are stuck in the
'Marry me, Marry me' loop..

588
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,745
..or you keep recounting
the history of San Francisco.

589
00:41:57,104 --> 00:41:58,625
I don't want to know. Okay?

590
00:41:58,704 --> 00:42:00,385
I know everything about this city.

591
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:01,945
Liar. Liar.

592
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:04,105
It's impossible to know
everything about a city.

593
00:42:04,184 --> 00:42:04,945
I've tried.
- Really?

594
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,345
Liar. Liar.

595
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:07,625
Are you challenging me?
- Bum on fire.

596
00:42:07,704 --> 00:42:08,706
Liar. Liar. - Are you
challenging me? - Bum on fire.

597
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:10,186
Okay. You're on.
- I知 on.

598
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:11,306
You're on.
- Liar. Liar..

599
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:15,186
lf you can show me one
place or thing in this city..

600
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:18,226
..that I haven't seen before then..
- You'll marry me.

601
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:21,786
You'll marry me.
- Whatever.

602
00:42:21,866 --> 00:42:22,626
Whatever.
- Okay. Okay.

603
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:23,546
You'll marry me.

604
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,787
But till then..

605
00:42:24,867 --> 00:42:26,187
..you will shut your encyclopedia.
- Okay.

606
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:27,267
And no 'Marry me, Marry me'.
- Okay.

607
00:42:27,347 --> 00:42:28,867
Okay.
- Okay. Whatever.

608
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:30,427
You'll marry me.

609
00:42:31,306 --> 00:42:35,547
And you're right.. the first cable
car came to San Francisco in 1873.

610
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:36,827
Yeah.

611
00:42:36,907 --> 00:42:40,028
And in the same year, the
first tram was started in Kolkata.

612
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:41,028
Did you know that?

613
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:42,708
No. You're smart.

614
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:43,708
That I am.

615
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:46,108
And pretty.
- That too.

616
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:48,108
I知 pretty smart too.

617
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:50,628
Mom. Come on.

618
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:51,908
Coming. One minute, Sam.

619
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:53,268
I値l just come back, okay?
- Okay.

620
00:42:53,348 --> 00:42:54,388
Yeah. Let me handle it.

621
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:57,029
Mrs. V, you are looking beautiful.
- You are the best.

622
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,629
But you make me come
too far for my hair.

623
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:03,029
Please accept my offer
and move to Banville.

624
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:05,109
You are very generous,
Mrs. V, but I..

625
00:43:05,188 --> 00:43:07,549
Shh about that.
Sara, you tell her.

626
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:09,029
You should move, Mandira.

627
00:43:09,108 --> 00:43:10,950
We'll be neighbours.
It will be fun.

628
00:43:11,149 --> 00:43:13,350
Mrs. V, I just don't know..
- Mom, come on.

629
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,550
Okay. I am just coming back.

630
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:16,590
Give me a minute. Sam..
- Don't worry, Granny. She'll move.

631
00:43:16,669 --> 00:43:17,990
God, he's driving me crazy.
- Mom!

632
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:18,950
Yes. Yes. What is it?

633
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,430
Mom. Come on.
- Where?

634
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,070
You forgot? Discovery museum.

635
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:25,110
Oh, my God. I知 so sorry.
Sam, I forgot.

636
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:26,190
Not fair.
- I remember.

637
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:27,391
You always forget.

638
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,831
Mandira. Mandira,
I have made a list of places..

639
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:30,391
All my friends have been there!

640
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:31,631
..which you may not have seen..
- Even I want to go. Let's go now!

641
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,791
No, I don't care.
- Just.. Just..

642
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:33,991
..then we can do what you
have asked me not to speak about.

643
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,151
Let's go now! Now! Now!

644
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,311
Sam, Just..
- It's close by.

645
00:43:36,391 --> 00:43:37,591
It's just 22 minutes away from here.
We can take a cable car..

646
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:38,751
Just.. Just.. Just shut up.

647
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,951
One minute.

648
00:43:40,031 --> 00:43:41,191
Just give me a minute, okay?

649
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,352
This list can wait.

650
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:43,712
First, you have to
do something for me.

651
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,472
Will you take Sam
to Discovery museum?

652
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:46,712
No.
- Please.

653
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,352
No, please.

654
00:43:48,432 --> 00:43:49,952
Oh, no, no, no, no.

655
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:51,632

656
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:52,632
No, please don't kill yourself.

657
00:43:52,711 --> 00:43:53,552

Okay, I値l take him.

660
00:43:56,671 --> 00:43:58,233
Let's go, Sam.

661
00:43:58,312 --> 00:44:00,193
Let's go, Sam.
- Okay.

662
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:02,033
Look after him and
don't let go of the hand.

663
00:44:02,112 --> 00:44:03,873
Okay?
- Okay.

664
00:44:04,593 --> 00:44:07,153
Not mine. His hand.

665
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,953
Please, please, don't kill yourself.

666
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:12,353
Sam, where's your hand?

667
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:14,874
What are you doing?

668
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:16,954
Mom said not to let go of your hand.

669
00:44:17,153 --> 00:44:18,634
Mom is mad!

670
00:44:18,713 --> 00:44:19,594
No touching, okay?

671
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:20,634
No touching?
- Get it?

672
00:44:20,713 --> 00:44:23,034
Okay. Okay. No touching.

673
00:44:23,113 --> 00:44:24,034
I like that. No touching.

674
00:44:24,113 --> 00:44:25,554
Okay, everybody knows how to play.

675
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:27,874
We have Team A. Hello. Welcome.

676
00:44:27,954 --> 00:44:29,955
And Team B. Good luck.

677
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:32,835
But now we need one
more team. We need Team C.

678
00:44:32,915 --> 00:44:34,875
Now who's going to be Team C?

679
00:44:35,035 --> 00:44:36,115
What game is this?

680
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:38,075
Can't you see? It's a puzzle.

681
00:44:38,234 --> 00:44:40,195
This grid has names of
animals hidden in it.

682
00:44:40,274 --> 00:44:45,676
The team that identifies the maximum
number of animals wins a prize.

683
00:44:45,755 --> 00:44:46,996
Team C, anybody?

684
00:44:47,076 --> 00:44:49,916
Last time Mom and I played, we lost.

685
00:44:49,996 --> 00:44:51,356
Stupid game.

686
00:44:51,436 --> 00:44:54,636
Who's brave enough to
try to win the prize?

687
00:45:11,397 --> 00:45:12,637
Mom is mad!

688
00:45:12,716 --> 00:45:16,317
Who wants to volunteer to be
Team C and win this fabulous prize?

689
00:45:16,518 --> 00:45:18,958
Oh terrific. We have a volunteer.

690
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:22,038
Okay, just step forward and
we'll get started with the game.

691
00:45:22,117 --> 00:45:25,518
What are you doing? No, no, no,
it's embarrassing. - No touching.

692
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:26,318
Please! We'll lose.
- No touching.

693
00:45:26,398 --> 00:45:27,198
No..

694
00:45:27,277 --> 00:45:32,559
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

695
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:35,799

699
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:48,720

00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,240
Monkey.

701
00:45:56,279 --> 00:45:59,200
I guess we have a winner. Team C.

702
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:02,000
Come on, come here
and take your prize.

703
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,801
There you go. Congratulations.

704
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:06,001
Let's hear it for Team C.

705
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,001
Mom! Mom! We won.

706
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,321
Oh wow. Hugging, my son?
That's special.

707
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:14,241
What did you win?

708
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,641
Here! We won because of Khan.

709
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,202
Oh no, no, no, no.
My name is not Khan, its Khan.

710
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:21,762
That's what I said.. Khan.

711
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:26,522
No, not Khan. From the epiglottis,
Khan. Khan.

712
00:46:27,602 --> 00:46:32,802
From the epiglottis.
Epiglottis. Khan.

713
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:34,883
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Time out. Time out.

714
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:36,163
Time out.
- Khan.

715
00:46:36,242 --> 00:46:37,483
Okay? Okay?
- Khan.

716
00:46:37,603 --> 00:46:41,203
Is there any other place
you want to show me, Khan?

717
00:46:41,282 --> 00:46:42,403
Yeah.

718
00:46:46,523 --> 00:46:47,923
Been here.

719
00:46:49,202 --> 00:46:50,403
Seen this.

720
00:46:51,364 --> 00:46:52,804
Bowed here.

721
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:55,124
Fell in there.
- I know.

722
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:56,284
Then why are we here?

723
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:57,804
Sam wanted to feed the ducks.

724
00:46:57,884 --> 00:47:00,284
Oh, yeah Khan, Khan come
on let's go feed the ducks.

725
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:02,924
Come on! You want to hold my hands.
- Okay.

726
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:15,885
You know, Khan.
- I don't know.

727
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:18,605
I was 22 when I divorced.

728
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:21,005
I was only 22 years old.
- 22.

729
00:47:21,764 --> 00:47:23,326
I had nothing.

730
00:47:24,205 --> 00:47:25,486
No money.

731
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:27,686
No parental support.

732
00:47:28,406 --> 00:47:30,806
I didn't even have a house.

733
00:47:30,886 --> 00:47:32,126
Okay.

734
00:47:32,765 --> 00:47:34,806
I had only Sam with me.

735
00:47:36,285 --> 00:47:38,807
I didn't know what the
future had in store.

736
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:42,607
One day, as I was thinking,
I started walking.

737
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:47,727
I walked a lot and
stopped after reaching here.

738
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:52,327
There was no way ahead.

739
00:47:52,407 --> 00:47:54,048
Yeah, only water.

740
00:47:54,127 --> 00:47:55,768
So, I turned back.

741
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,768
Saw the entire city in front of me.

742
00:48:01,928 --> 00:48:06,248
And for a minute, I felt
it was waiting for me.

743
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:08,929
I decided then..

744
00:48:09,688 --> 00:48:13,689
No, I知 going to make this work.

745
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:15,689
And I知 going to win.

746
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:17,609
We shall overcome.

747
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:18,649
We shall overcome?

748
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:20,809
Yes! We shall overcome.

749
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:22,369
It's my favorite song.

750
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:26,970
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

751
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:31,370
We shall overcome. One day.

752
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:40,130
The heart believes in it.
That we shall overcome one day.

753
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,051
Oh, no, no, no, no.

754
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,611
You sing badly.

755
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:44,851
You suck. You suck.
- What?!

756
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:47,451
What?! As if you are any better!

757
00:48:58,331 --> 00:48:59,892
You are staring at me.

758
00:48:59,972 --> 00:49:01,252
You are staring.

759
00:49:01,492 --> 00:49:02,972
You are staring.
- Okay.

760
00:49:03,052 --> 00:49:04,172
Okay.

761
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:08,132
Sam and I are moving
to Banville next month.

762
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:09,532
Banville.

763
00:49:09,731 --> 00:49:12,453
I知 opening my own salon there.

764
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,653
Banvile, California.

765
00:49:13,732 --> 00:49:16,093
Population 30,OOO.
- Yes.

766
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:18,253
Take me with you, Mandira.

767
00:49:18,613 --> 00:49:20,133
I知 thin, I won't need much space.

768
00:49:20,212 --> 00:49:21,293
I値l keep an eye on Sam.

769
00:49:21,373 --> 00:49:22,813
I値l never let go of his hand.

770
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,933

772
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:28,254
Dishwasher, microwave oven,

773
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,174
..refrigerator
I値l repair everything.

774
00:49:30,253 --> 00:49:31,094
Please take me with you.
- Khan.

775
00:49:31,173 --> 00:49:32,414
No, no. Please take me with you.

776
00:49:32,494 --> 00:49:34,134
Khan, we are getting late.
We have to go.

777
00:49:34,213 --> 00:49:35,334
No, no please take me with you

778
00:49:35,414 --> 00:49:39,334
Khan, we are getting late.
We have to go. - Okay, okay

779
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:43,095
And by the way,
I have been here before.

780
00:49:46,694 --> 00:49:48,535
Come on.
- Okay.

781
00:49:49,134 --> 00:49:52,575
Many things frighten me, Mandira.

782
00:49:52,654 --> 00:49:57,175
But nothing frightens me more
than the thought of losing you.

783
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:08,416
I was scared then..

784
00:50:08,775 --> 00:50:11,656
..and I知 scared now.

785
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:25,537
We're full, partner, no room.

786
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:28,657
Okay.. is there any
other motel nearby?

787
00:50:28,736 --> 00:50:31,458
Oh, you are an Indian.
I値l make some adjustments.

788
00:50:31,538 --> 00:50:34,538
You know, it's a Saturday.

789
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:37,538
So, all the honeymoon
couples have booked my rooms.

790
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:38,698
Saturday?

791
00:50:38,777 --> 00:50:41,218
Why? Do they marry
only on Saturdays here?

792
00:50:41,378 --> 00:50:46,139
The one-night marriages..
try and understand.

793
00:50:46,218 --> 00:50:47,139
But you don't worry.

794
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:48,659
You can stay in my room.

795
00:50:48,738 --> 00:50:50,499
It has a nude channel too!

796
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:51,899
Nude channel?

797
00:50:51,979 --> 00:50:54,579
The naughty and noisy channel.

798
00:50:54,658 --> 00:50:57,179
Naughty? Noisy?

799
00:50:57,939 --> 00:50:59,139
Down. Down!

800
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:01,500
You fool. You idiot!

801
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,580
I値l burn that fair
skin of yours, you idiot!

802
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:08,140
Rascal! Rascal!

803
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:10,540
All this is because
of the lousy Muslims.

804
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,660
Six years ago, they blew
up the World Trade Centre..

805
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:14,540
..and today, we bear
the brunt of it.

806
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,661
They call for jihad (holy war) and
we have to suffer the consequences.

807
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,421
And these white folk?
All blind donkeys!

808
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:23,741
Can't you make out the difference
between a Gandhian Indian..

809
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,221
..and a violent Muslim?

810
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,941
Should I show you?!

811
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,461
I知 going to put a board
out here: No Muslims Allowed!

812
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,022
This is the fourth
glass broken by the rogues!

813
00:51:35,102 --> 00:51:39,942
Don't worry, Brother. Come here.
It's dangerous out there.

814
00:51:40,022 --> 00:51:43,502
Listen.. come back!
What's your name?

815
00:51:44,622 --> 00:51:47,702
My name is Khan, and
I知 not a terrorist.

816
00:51:54,222 --> 00:51:55,823
Thank you.

817
00:52:01,063 --> 00:52:02,783
I miss you Mandira.

818
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:07,384
I know I can't return
before meeting the President.

819
00:52:07,464 --> 00:52:11,904
I couldn't meet him in Washington,
so, now I知 going to Santa Fe.

820
00:52:12,143 --> 00:52:15,264
One can achieve
everything by trying, Mandira.

821
00:52:15,504 --> 00:52:18,984
Like I found that place. That day.

822
00:52:24,704 --> 00:52:26,465
Yes, I知 coming, coming.

823
00:52:27,184 --> 00:52:28,545
Khan, thank God.

824
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:29,545
Where were you all these days?

825
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:30,665
I was so worried about you.

826
00:52:30,744 --> 00:52:31,985
You could have called.

827
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,545
But no, you won't.

828
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:35,746
Cell phones are bad for bees.
- Now.

829
00:52:35,825 --> 00:52:37,066
What?

830
00:52:38,145 --> 00:52:40,426
But wait. Tell me
where we are going?

831
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:43,426
I am not dressed properly.
I don't even have my shoes.

832
00:52:53,226 --> 00:52:55,987
Here. It's close.

833
00:52:56,067 --> 00:52:57,387
Where?

834
00:53:08,827 --> 00:53:10,588
What do you mean one minute?

835
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:12,268
One minute.

836
00:53:12,347 --> 00:53:14,308
Keep quiet, Mandira. Quiet.
- Okay.

837
00:53:14,388 --> 00:53:16,388
Quiet, Mandira. Quiet, quiet.
- Okay.

838
00:53:16,468 --> 00:53:18,188
Quiet.
- Okay.

839
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,708
I have been timing it for six days.

840
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:21,508
One minute.

841
00:53:21,588 --> 00:53:22,108
Close your eyes.

842
00:53:22,187 --> 00:53:23,509
Close your eyes.
- Okay.

843
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:24,509
Now, now, now, now.
- Okay.

844
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:26,069
Close your eyes. Okay.

845
00:53:26,148 --> 00:53:30,549
Okay, okay, okay, okay

846
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,190
Now, open your eyes.

847
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:40,350
Open your eyes.

848
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,390
Open now. Now, now.

849
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,230
Now, please.

850
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:04,791
Have you seen this before?

851
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:13,792
No.

852
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:21,512
Khan.
- Okay.

853
00:54:23,072 --> 00:54:24,352
Marry me.

854
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,713
Marry me.

855
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:40,273
Okay.
- Marry me.

856
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:48,074
You cannot marry her.
It's blasphemy!

857
00:54:48,793 --> 00:54:52,074
And if you do, I will
sever all ties with you.

858
00:54:52,153 --> 00:54:54,434
You will have no place in my house.

859
00:54:55,914 --> 00:54:57,635
She is a Hindu.

860
00:54:57,714 --> 00:55:00,235
There's a lot of difference between
them and us, understood?

861
00:55:03,754 --> 00:55:06,435
No. There's no difference.

862
00:55:07,115 --> 00:55:11,275
Good people.. bad people.
There's no other difference.

863
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:23,196
Mandira.

864
00:55:24,275 --> 00:55:25,716
Welcome.

865
00:55:25,795 --> 00:55:29,837
So, after your marriage,
will my name be Sameer Khan?

866
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:33,717
It will be Sameer Khan,
from the epiglottis.

867
00:56:53,157 --> 00:56:54,157
Hi!
Hi, hi...

868
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:58,087
This is my husband. Mark Garret.
Nice to meet you.

869
00:56:58,088 --> 00:57:01,308
Mark is a TV producer with Care U.N and
this is Reese.

870
00:57:01,025 --> 00:57:02,306
Hey!
Hi!

871
00:57:02,307 --> 00:57:03,930
And this is Rizvan.

872
00:57:09,705 --> 00:57:10,705
C'mon, c'mon.

873
00:58:00,765 --> 00:58:02,246
Khan.
- Yeah.

874
00:58:04,285 --> 00:58:06,607
We can't do this without touching.

875
00:58:06,686 --> 00:58:07,847
I know.
- You know.

876
00:58:07,927 --> 00:58:08,967
Yeah.

877
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:11,927
I have read it in this book.

878
00:58:12,127 --> 00:58:15,847
Intercourse for dumbos,
by Dr. Richard k. Woomer.

879
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:19,247
Okay.
- Nice pictures.

880
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,408
I think we should do it.

881
00:58:24,488 --> 00:58:30,648
Now, now we should do it now.
- One minute, and..

882
00:58:30,727 --> 00:58:32,368
Oh, no, no not one minute.

883
00:58:32,448 --> 00:58:33,728
Yeah.

884
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:36,128
It will take longer than one minute.

885
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,371
Bye, Khan.
- Bye, Sam.

886
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:21,491
Lunch. Lunch. Lunch. Lunch. Lunch.
- Quick, quick.

887
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:22,331
Bye, Joe.

888
00:59:22,411 --> 00:59:24,932
Bye! The apple of my eye!

889
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:46,413
And your hair looks
very pretty, ma'am.

890
00:59:46,493 --> 00:59:49,533
Thank you, sweetheart.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

891
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,053
Were you flirting with her?

892
00:59:53,292 --> 00:59:56,534
You're not a liar.
- Okay.

893
00:59:56,614 --> 00:59:58,934
Reese, I've to do my homework.
Let me go home.

894
00:59:59,014 --> 01:00:00,614
Just 10 minutes, okay.
- Only 10 minutes.

895
01:00:00,693 --> 01:00:01,774
Alright.

896
01:00:02,094 --> 01:00:05,654
Surprise.

897
01:00:07,693 --> 01:00:09,254
Thank you, Daddy.

898
01:00:09,534 --> 01:00:11,815
Daddy? What about me?

899
01:00:12,015 --> 01:00:16,575
Happy birthday to you.

900
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:24,455
Mandira. Mandira, can we
have sex please. - Now?

901
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:26,576
Now, now is good.

902
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:45,977
With Allah's blessings,
I fulfilled my promise to Ammi (mother).

903
01:00:46,336 --> 01:00:50,177
I made a happy life for myself.

904
01:01:03,177 --> 01:01:04,778
Hello.

905
01:01:06,098 --> 01:01:07,258
Yes, Sarah.

906
01:01:09,658 --> 01:01:10,978
What?

907
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:13,939
Khan, switch on the TV, please.

908
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:15,899
Yes, Sarah let me
call you back, okay.

909
01:01:17,419 --> 01:01:19,979
I've never seen
anything like this before..

910
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,499
Oh, my God!

911
01:01:22,939 --> 01:01:27,539
A second plane.. a second
plane just hit the other tower.

912
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:32,180
The skyline of Manhattan
has been changed forever.

913
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:35,300
New York's twin towers are gone.

914
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,060
Both towers have been hit.

915
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:45,981
It must've been
a coordinated attack..

916
01:02:16,143 --> 01:02:19,503
Mom, why are Reese and Mrs. Garrick
taking money from everyone?

917
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,783
Donations, baby.

918
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:25,263
For the family of the fire-fighters
who died saving people during 9/11 .

919
01:02:26,262 --> 01:02:28,223
Hi.
- Hi.

920
01:02:28,302 --> 01:02:30,143
How is it going?
- Good, good.

921
01:02:30,222 --> 01:02:32,024
The Johnson's just
gave a thousand dollars.

922
01:02:32,104 --> 01:02:33,264
Wow.

923
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:34,584
Thank you.

924
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:35,664
Oh, God.
- Here.

925
01:02:35,743 --> 01:02:37,504
3500 dollars.

926
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:39,824
It's annual Zakat
(religious tax) money.

927
01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:41,824
It's a duty in Islam.
Duty, duty, duty.

928
01:02:41,944 --> 01:02:44,024
In Islam they donate a certain
percentage of their..

929
01:02:44,104 --> 01:02:46,024
..income each year in charity.
- Yes.

930
01:02:46,104 --> 01:02:47,705
This year, how could
it be anything else?

931
01:02:47,784 --> 01:02:53,345
Yes, that's $3502
and 50 cents exactly.

932
01:03:47,468 --> 01:03:53,869
In the western world, history
is marked simply by BC and AD.

933
01:03:54,348 --> 01:03:58,789
But now, there is a
third distinction. 9/11 .

934
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,470
Reports are in from
various parts of America that..

935
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,070
..Muslims are being
targeted and attacked.

936
01:04:11,869 --> 01:04:13,430
Back off.

937
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:15,270
Get away.

938
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:18,310
A Sikh employee in Michigan
was shot dead by his employer..

939
01:04:18,389 --> 01:04:21,511
..because he was
mistaken for an Afghani.

940
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,471
In the wake of 9/11 , a lot of
American Muslims are changing..

941
01:04:24,551 --> 01:04:27,471
..their names to escape
racial profiling.

942
01:04:27,551 --> 01:04:30,391
Questions are being raised
about America's biased views..

943
01:04:30,471 --> 01:04:32,551
..towards the Islamic community.

944
01:04:32,631 --> 01:04:36,231
Even as Muslim women wearing
hijabs (veils) are being targeted.

945
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:42,672
Post 9/11 , America's view
towards its Islamic inhabitants..

946
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,912
..is changing rapidly.

947
01:04:47,472 --> 01:04:49,232
They must be getting late.

948
01:04:49,311 --> 01:04:51,032
Let mom drop you today.

949
01:04:51,112 --> 01:04:52,993
And we'll grab an
ice-cream on the way. - Yeah.

950
01:04:53,073 --> 01:04:54,273
Come on.

951
01:04:54,593 --> 01:04:56,073
Of all the religions in the world..

952
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:58,833
..Islam is the most violent
and aggressive.

953
01:04:58,912 --> 01:05:03,793
It encourages killing or 'Jihad'
as they call it, in the name of God.

954
01:05:23,474 --> 01:05:28,435
Sam, you need to tell your
mom about this. - No, Reese.

955
01:05:28,794 --> 01:05:31,355
I think she already has
too much to worry about.

956
01:05:53,235 --> 01:05:55,396
Get out of my country.

957
01:06:11,797 --> 01:06:15,998
Don't wear this now.

958
01:06:22,158 --> 01:06:25,718
Allah will understand.
These people won't.

959
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,599
Never.

960
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,239
Yes?

961
01:06:38,959 --> 01:06:42,399
I知 Mandira. I heard
about Hasina, so..

962
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,360
She is upstairs,
bhabi (sister-in-law).

963
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:56,680
He won't come in.

964
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:21,002
Bhai (brother), please come in. Please.

965
01:07:38,643 --> 01:07:41,683
You are my good son, aren't you?

966
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:45,764
You are my good son, aren't you?

967
01:07:48,283 --> 01:07:52,084
Alright, Mandira,
you'll join us on Monday.

968
01:07:53,124 --> 01:07:54,524
Thank you so much.

969
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,804
I just want to clarify one thing.

970
01:07:58,243 --> 01:08:01,685
My last name is Khan,
my husband is Muslim.

971
01:08:03,165 --> 01:08:07,565
We'll see you on Monday.
- Thanks.

972
01:08:11,605 --> 01:08:15,205
Khan. I got the job, I got the job.
- Okay.

973
01:08:15,284 --> 01:08:16,325
I got the job.
- Okay.

974
01:08:16,405 --> 01:08:17,446
Now, everything will be all right.

975
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,606
We'll do it. We'll do it.
- I know.

976
01:08:18,686 --> 01:08:19,446
We'll do it.
- We'll do it.

977
01:08:19,526 --> 01:08:20,126
Yes, yes, yes.

978
01:08:20,206 --> 01:08:23,006
We shall overcome?

979
01:08:23,085 --> 01:08:27,526
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

980
01:08:27,606 --> 01:08:28,966
You suck.

981
01:08:29,045 --> 01:08:31,486
You suck. Please don't sing.

982
01:08:33,086 --> 01:08:38,367
We shall overcome. I know,
Mandira, we will..

983
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:46,167
I知 in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
to meet the President.

984
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:51,248
His motorcade has 12 cars..

985
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:57,608
..but no one tells me
which car the President is in.

986
01:09:09,369 --> 01:09:15,529
Mandira, I don't know why, but I
keep failing to meet the President.

987
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,089
But I know I have to meet him.

988
01:09:18,168 --> 01:09:21,250
I have to tell him about Sam.

989
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:26,970
Sam. Khan.

990
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:28,810
So there you guys are.

991
01:09:28,889 --> 01:09:30,770
So, how was your day?

992
01:09:30,849 --> 01:09:32,410
Again Xbox?

993
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,451
Make place for me,
make place for me.

994
01:09:35,531 --> 01:09:37,691
Don't hug me mom.
- Come here, sweety.

995
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:38,811
Don't hug me.

996
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,891
And how are you sweetheart? - No,
no don't hug me, don't hug me, no.

997
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:49,211
Phone.
- I know.

998
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:51,052
But I値l be back.
- Why?

999
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:53,172
Because you've no choice.

1000
01:09:55,372 --> 01:09:57,972
Hello. Hey Sarah.

1001
01:09:59,216 --> 01:10:01,017
Mark's been sent to cover the war.

1002
01:10:01,018 --> 01:10:02,944
In Afghanistan.

1003
01:10:06,011 --> 01:10:08,853
Reese, pass Mrs. Khan the salad.

1004
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:12,053
Sam, you okay?
- Yeah, I知 fine.

1005
01:10:12,132 --> 01:10:14,453
Sarah, we are fine.

1006
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:18,733
I知 fine.

1007
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:22,574
Rizvan, how is the chicken?

1008
01:10:22,654 --> 01:10:25,934
Do you like it?
- No, not at all.

1009
01:10:29,013 --> 01:10:31,574
Did I.. did I say a joke?

1010
01:10:32,093 --> 01:10:33,534
Yes you did, Rizvan.

1011
01:10:33,614 --> 01:10:37,094
And a very good one indeed.
- Thank you Mark.

1012
01:10:37,294 --> 01:10:39,255
But the chicken is not good.

1013
01:10:40,014 --> 01:10:43,655
It's a new recipe. I..
- Don't make it ever again.

1014
01:10:45,335 --> 01:10:48,935
Mark was going to cover the
war in Afghanistan, Mandira.

1015
01:10:50,094 --> 01:10:51,695
Ammi (mother) was right.

1016
01:10:51,774 --> 01:10:53,816
Families are not just made by blood.

1017
01:10:53,895 --> 01:10:55,616
They are made with love too.

1018
01:10:55,696 --> 01:11:00,216
Sarah, Mark and Reese had
become a part of our world.

1019
01:11:00,376 --> 01:11:04,256
But I never told them that..

1020
01:11:04,815 --> 01:11:06,736
I should have told them.

1021
01:11:30,977 --> 01:11:32,618
Take care, buddy.

1022
01:11:35,017 --> 01:11:37,538
See you, Reese.
- Take care, Reese.

1023
01:11:40,137 --> 01:11:41,619
Hey, Reese.

1024
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:03,300
In chapter five, verse 32 of the
Quran, Allah has decreed that..

1025
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:10,260
..the death of one innocent is
equal to the death of humanity.

1026
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:29,502
I knew that the death of innocents in
9/11 would cost the entire humanity.

1027
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:34,422
But I did not know that you
and I would have to pay..

1028
01:12:34,502 --> 01:12:36,422
..the biggest price, Mandira.

1029
01:12:37,262 --> 01:12:41,742
Why did this happen
to us, Mandira? Why?

1030
01:12:49,822 --> 01:12:52,583
Reese. Just talk to me man.

1031
01:12:52,663 --> 01:12:55,143
Wait a minute. Why are
you ignoring me, Reese?

1032
01:12:55,223 --> 01:12:56,583
Its been so many days since..

1033
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:59,184
Reese, listen to me. Wait a minute.

1034
01:12:59,664 --> 01:13:01,704
Please listen to me man.

1035
01:13:01,863 --> 01:13:04,064
What's the problem?
What have I done?

1036
01:13:04,143 --> 01:13:05,824
Reese, just listen to me.
- Piss off.

1037
01:13:05,903 --> 01:13:07,104
Listen to me.

1038
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:16,265

- Khan.

1049
01:13:47,906 --> 01:13:49,627
Khan, please don't be angry with me.

1050
01:13:49,707 --> 01:13:51,427
I don't have any
friends apart from you.

1051
01:13:51,507 --> 01:13:53,547
Liar. Liar.

1052
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:54,747
Reese is your friend.

1053
01:13:54,826 --> 01:13:55,947
He's your friend.
- Right.

1054
01:13:56,026 --> 01:13:58,147
You're a liar. He's your friend.

1055
01:13:58,227 --> 01:14:00,187

Chill out mom.

1074
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:45,150
Whatever. I値l be late today,
I have soccer practise.

1075
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:47,230
Do you have to play soccer?

1076
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:48,510
Do you have to cut hair?

1077
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:49,831
very clever.

1078
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:53,311
The apple of my eye!

1079
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,751
Sam. Sam.

1080
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:00,191
Why is Sam walking so strangely?

1081
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:03,391
Why are you laughing so strangely?

1082
01:15:03,471 --> 01:15:06,232
You're too cute.
- No, no.

1083
01:15:06,312 --> 01:15:08,272
You're too cute.
- No, no, please, please.

1084

No, no, please. Please, don't hug me.

1087
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:20,112
November 27, 2007. 8:23 am.

1088
01:15:21,072 --> 01:15:25,513
I still remember the day.. That's
the last time I heard you laugh.

1089
01:15:25,593 --> 01:15:28,433
Reese. Reese.

1090
01:15:28,713 --> 01:15:29,953
Reese, you haven't
spoken in eight days now.

1091
01:15:30,032 --> 01:15:31,273
What's up?
- Just leave me alone.

1092
01:15:31,353 --> 01:15:33,233
What's with you? You
know I loved your dad.

1093
01:15:33,313 --> 01:15:35,033
Just.. don't talk about my dad.

1094
01:15:35,112 --> 01:15:37,234
Come on, Reese, we're best friends.
Our moms are best friends.

1095
01:15:37,314 --> 01:15:39,314
You know what you people
are nobody's best friends.

1096
01:15:39,394 --> 01:15:41,594
All you people care is about
your damn 'Jihad' or whatever.

1097
01:15:41,674 --> 01:15:42,954
What are you talking about man?

1098
01:15:43,033 --> 01:15:44,754
Reese, just listen to me.
- Just go away.

1099
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:46,754
No, Reese, you listen..
- Shut up, and go! - Listen.

1100
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:49,674
Sameer, I said go away.
- Listen to me man.

1101
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:50,954
Just go away.

1102
01:15:51,033 --> 01:15:52,115
Look at those two little brats.

1103
01:15:52,194 --> 01:15:55,035
Hey, ladies, come on
time out. Come on.

1104
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:56,395
Didn't you hear him?

1105
01:15:56,475 --> 01:15:57,835
He said ''Leave him alone''.

1106
01:15:57,914 --> 01:15:59,675
So why don't you go
home to your mummy.

1107
01:15:59,754 --> 01:16:02,435
Stay out of it.
- What?

1108
01:16:02,515 --> 01:16:04,155
I said, stay out of it.
- What did you say?

1109
01:16:04,235 --> 01:16:06,235
You heard me, stay out of it.

1110
01:16:07,315 --> 01:16:08,836
Jim, let him go.
- What's the matter?

1111
01:16:08,915 --> 01:16:10,436
Don't you care about your dead dad?
- Yeah, but..

1112
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:13,076
Is Osama your lover?
- Let him go.

1113
01:16:13,155 --> 01:16:14,756
So.. dead.

1114
01:16:18,499 --> 01:16:20,540
Stop it guys, you're hurting him.

1115
01:16:21,459 --> 01:16:23,221
Oh, he liked that one.

1116
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:27,821
What did he just do.

1117
01:16:27,901 --> 01:16:29,581
Let's get him guys.

1118
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:37,821
Hey, Osama's son.

1119
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:39,422
Bloody Paki.

1120
01:16:39,212 --> 01:16:40,212
I said c'mon

1121
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,200
C'mon

1122
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:45,059
Dammit, take it.

1123
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,200
Leave him be!

1124
01:16:47,363 --> 01:16:48,271
Sam!

1125
01:16:48,272 --> 01:16:49,272
Yeah, give it to him man.

1126
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:50,995
Give it to him!

1127
01:16:50,996 --> 01:16:51,996
Sam!

1128
01:16:52,521 --> 01:16:53,521
Sam!

1129
01:16:54,092 --> 01:16:55,092
Sam!

1130
01:16:55,337 --> 01:16:55,432
C'mon get up!

1131
01:16:55,433 --> 01:16:56,433
Let's see you give it when
you can take!

1132
01:16:57,393 --> 01:16:58,393
Why are you screaming!

1133
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:03,860
Get him bastard, This is gonna
be fun!

1134
01:17:06,387 --> 01:17:07,387
Get away!

1135
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:09,427
Get away!

1136
01:17:17,143 --> 01:17:21,024
Screw you assholes
- What did you say?

1137
01:17:21,343 --> 01:17:22,864
Screw you.

1138
01:17:31,937 --> 01:17:32,937
GOAL!

1139
01:17:43,786 --> 01:17:46,186
Sameer. Come on buddy, get up.

1140
01:17:46,265 --> 01:17:47,466
Sameer.

1141
01:17:47,546 --> 01:17:49,146
Sameer, come on.

1142
01:17:49,225 --> 01:17:52,066
Sameer. Sameer.

1143
01:17:52,145 --> 01:17:54,506
Oh, shit.
- Come on.

1144
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:55,906
This didn't happen, okay.

1145
01:17:55,986 --> 01:17:58,867
This didn't happen
this didn't happen.

1146
01:17:58,947 --> 01:18:00,427
Or else..

1147
01:18:00,506 --> 01:18:02,267
Do you hear me?

1148
01:18:27,387 --> 01:18:28,629
Mrs. Khan. I知 detective Garcia.

1149
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:30,789
I need to ask you some
questions about this?

1150
01:18:30,869 --> 01:18:32,469
Later.
- Let's get him into the ER.

1151
01:18:32,549 --> 01:18:35,629
Is the trauma team ready?
- Yes, they are..

1152
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:37,709
Lip discoloration..
discolouration of the face.

1153
01:18:37,789 --> 01:18:39,109
How is his pulse?
- Rapid pulse.

1154
01:18:39,188 --> 01:18:42,269
Possible internal bleeding.
Possible spleen rupture.

1155
01:18:42,348 --> 01:18:44,750
What's going on?
- We got to do this fast, you guys.

1156
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:47,070
He's losing blood. I think
we got to give him blood.

1157
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:49,030
We got to do this fast.

1158
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:51,350
Spleen rupture.

1159
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:56,430
Spleen rupture. Spleen rupture.
Spleen rupture.

1160
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:59,750
Go, go, go.

1161
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,351
Ma'am, you need to stay out.

1162
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,671
Okay, what've we got here,
what've we got?

1163
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,071
No signs of internal bleeding.

1164
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:10,151
Give me vitals.

1165
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:11,951
Heart is throbbing extremely low.
- Okay.

1166
01:19:12,031 --> 01:19:14,431
Okay, defib now.
- He's technicardiac.

1167
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:16,592
Give me the defib.
- Ready for defib.

1168
01:19:16,672 --> 01:19:18,032
Okay, we're going to shock in 200.

1169
01:19:18,111 --> 01:19:19,592
Ready now.

1170
01:19:19,952 --> 01:19:21,152
Clear.

1171
01:19:21,832 --> 01:19:23,072
200.

1172
01:19:23,151 --> 01:19:28,992
One, two, three.. clear.
- Still no pulse.

1173
01:19:29,672 --> 01:19:30,912
Okay go to 300.

1174
01:19:30,992 --> 01:19:32,273
Clear.

1175
01:19:33,673 --> 01:19:35,513
Still no pulse, doctor.

1176
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,750
Oh c'mon...

1177
01:19:41,713 --> 01:19:43,513
We lost him.

1178
01:19:43,593 --> 01:19:45,993
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1179
01:20:05,474 --> 01:20:07,075
Sam.

1180
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,835
Ruptured spleen.. spleen.

1181
01:20:13,915 --> 01:20:16,555
It's the only part of
the human body..

1182
01:20:16,635 --> 01:20:18,836
..the use of which is
not known to doctors.

1183
01:20:19,075 --> 01:20:21,236
When the capsule
containing the spleen is ruptured..

1184
01:20:21,315 --> 01:20:24,196
..a splenectomy is performed,
and the spleen is removed.

1185
01:20:24,275 --> 01:20:30,276
But that can lead to
pneumococcal infection.

1186
01:20:30,355 --> 01:20:32,116
He's dead.

1187
01:20:34,116 --> 01:20:35,597
He's dead.

1188
01:20:40,757 --> 01:20:42,677
The spleen.. artey is clamped.

1189
01:20:42,757 --> 01:20:44,717
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1190
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:51,718
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1191
01:20:55,117 --> 01:20:58,998
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1192
01:21:46,721 --> 01:21:48,041
Sam.

1193
01:21:51,681 --> 01:21:53,562
Come back to me.

1194
01:21:56,281 --> 01:21:57,922
Come back to me, baby.

1195
01:22:02,121 --> 01:22:04,122
Come back to me, baby.

1196
01:22:08,282 --> 01:22:09,963
Don't leave me.

1197
01:22:11,883 --> 01:22:14,243
Don't leave me, please.

1198
01:22:18,282 --> 01:22:23,123
Come back to me please.
Please come back. Please.

1199
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:32,404
Come back to me, Sam.

1200
01:22:33,004 --> 01:22:35,724
Sam, come back.

1201
01:22:36,483 --> 01:22:38,924
Don't leave me.

1202
01:23:05,085 --> 01:23:06,686
I apologise for the late hour.

1203
01:23:06,766 --> 01:23:10,606
But 48 hours is our best window
to catch the attackers. - Yeah.

1204
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:13,327
Now, I've gone through the
medical examiner's reports.

1205
01:23:13,406 --> 01:23:15,847
The attack on your son
seems very personal Mrs. Khan.

1206
01:23:15,927 --> 01:23:18,247
It happened at the
community soccer field.

1207
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:23,007
Inspector Garcia told us
that our Sam's death..

1208
01:23:23,086 --> 01:23:25,287
..may have been a racial attack.

1209
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:29,048
His wounds were proof of that.

1210
01:23:29,327 --> 01:23:32,288
He was a Muslim, so he was killed.

1211
01:23:32,367 --> 01:23:35,288
But I couldn't understand.

1212
01:23:35,487 --> 01:23:39,528
Being a Muslim is not
a bad thing, Mandira.

1213
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:03,090
Sam.

1214
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:05,690
My baby.

1215
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:06,930
Mandira..

1216
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:08,290
We killed him.

1217
01:24:08,369 --> 01:24:09,450
Mandira..

1218
01:24:09,529 --> 01:24:11,370
We killed him.

1219
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,210
We killed him.

1220
01:24:13,289 --> 01:24:14,411
Mandira..

1221
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:16,371
Let's go home.

1222
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:20,451
We killed him.

1223
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:21,971
It's time for dinner.

1224
01:24:22,051 --> 01:24:23,451
Doctors say that post-traumatic
disorder causes people..

1225
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:24,611
..to ignore their health.

1226
01:24:24,691 --> 01:24:27,451
Both of us killed him. - You need
to take care of your health.

1227
01:24:27,691 --> 01:24:29,171
Just shut up, just shut up.

1228
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,492
Are you listening to
what I am saying?

1229
01:24:30,572 --> 01:24:33,332
We killed him!

1230
01:24:34,972 --> 01:24:36,892
It's all my fault.

1231
01:24:36,972 --> 01:24:38,852
It's all my fault.

1232
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,572
lf I hadn't married you..

1233
01:24:42,012 --> 01:24:43,692
..all this wouldn't have happened.

1234
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:49,293
I thought you loved me so much.

1235
01:24:49,492 --> 01:24:51,053
Loved Sam so much.

1236
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:52,813
What difference would it make..

1237
01:24:53,372 --> 01:24:55,253
..if his name is changed?

1238
01:24:55,653 --> 01:24:57,133
What difference would it make..

1239
01:24:57,212 --> 01:24:59,373
..if a 'Khan' was
added to his name?

1240
01:25:00,532 --> 01:25:02,294
But I was wrong.

1241
01:25:02,373 --> 01:25:04,014
It makes a difference.

1242
01:25:04,654 --> 01:25:06,254
It does make a difference.

1243
01:25:06,413 --> 01:25:08,974
I should never have
married a Muslim man!

1244
01:25:09,814 --> 01:25:12,774
lf Sam had been a Rathod (Hindu),
he would have been alive today.

1245
01:25:12,854 --> 01:25:14,574
He was a Khan, so, he died.

1246
01:25:14,654 --> 01:25:17,735
He died because of you.
Because of your surname!

1247
01:25:18,975 --> 01:25:21,135
I don't understand
what you are saying.

1248
01:25:21,655 --> 01:25:24,455
I don't understand what you
are saying. You are not well.

1249
01:25:24,534 --> 01:25:25,935
God.

1250
01:25:26,015 --> 01:25:28,575
I want to die.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1251
01:25:28,655 --> 01:25:29,855
I want to die.

1252
01:25:29,935 --> 01:25:33,736
No, no, no Mandira
please don't die.

1253
01:25:33,816 --> 01:25:35,976
No, no, please don't die.

1254
01:25:36,056 --> 01:25:37,376
You can't die.

1255
01:25:37,455 --> 01:25:38,536
Please don't die.

1256
01:25:38,616 --> 01:25:41,296
Just leave me alone, please.

1257
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:43,136
Leave me please.

1258
01:25:43,215 --> 01:25:45,176
I don't even want to see you.

1259
01:25:45,255 --> 01:25:46,696
Whenever I see you..

1260
01:25:46,776 --> 01:25:49,617
..I remember Sam's wounds.

1261
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,617
I can't do this.

1262
01:25:53,897 --> 01:25:55,657
I can't do this anymore.

1263
01:25:56,136 --> 01:25:57,737
I知 leaving you, Khan.

1264
01:25:57,817 --> 01:26:00,017
I知 leaving you!

1265
01:26:00,096 --> 01:26:01,497
Why should you leave?

1266
01:26:01,577 --> 01:26:03,297
The house is yours. I will leave.

1267
01:26:03,376 --> 01:26:06,058
Go right now! This instant!

1268
01:26:06,618 --> 01:26:08,098
Go right now.

1269
01:26:08,177 --> 01:26:12,258
Go! Go!

1270
01:26:19,659 --> 01:26:21,299
Mandira..

1271
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:25,979
When should I come back?

1272
01:26:27,258 --> 01:26:28,979
When should you be back?

1273
01:26:30,378 --> 01:26:32,059
When should you be back?

1274
01:26:33,298 --> 01:26:35,300
You know Banville?

1275
01:26:35,499 --> 01:26:37,540
It has a population of 30,OOO.

1276
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:42,060
And each one of those
30,OOO people hates you.

1277
01:26:42,139 --> 01:26:44,540
Tell all of them that
you are not a terrorist.

1278
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:46,340
Why only them?

1279
01:26:46,419 --> 01:26:50,180
Tell every person in America.

1280
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:54,261
Can you do that? Can you?

1281
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:55,861
No, you can't.

1282
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:59,101
Why don't you tell the
President of United States then?

1283
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:04,141
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and I知 not a terrorist.

1284
01:27:04,861 --> 01:27:06,982
So, he can tell all these people..

1285
01:27:07,261 --> 01:27:10,942
..that my Sam was not the terrorist
son of a terrorist father.

1286
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:13,382
He was just a baby.

1287
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:16,382
My baby.

1288
01:27:19,582 --> 01:27:21,462
When you do that..

1289
01:27:22,663 --> 01:27:24,343
..come back.

1290
01:27:25,422 --> 01:27:27,183
Come back then!

1291
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:39,584
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and I知 not a terrorist.

1292
01:27:39,664 --> 01:27:43,064
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and I知 not a terrorist.

1293
01:27:43,223 --> 01:27:47,624
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and I知 not a terrorist.

1294
01:27:48,064 --> 01:27:51,704
My name is Khan and
I知 not a terrorist.

1295
01:27:52,024 --> 01:27:54,745
My name is Khan and
I知 not a terrorist.

1296
01:27:54,825 --> 01:27:56,625
Not a terrorist.

1297
01:29:04,789 --> 01:29:07,189
Mandira, I felt a stab
of pain in my chest..

1298
01:29:07,268 --> 01:29:09,509
..when I left you.

1299
01:29:09,589 --> 01:29:11,750
I thought it was chest congestion.

1300
01:29:12,349 --> 01:29:17,350
But no amount of ginger juice
could make the pain go away.

1301
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,390
It's still there.

1302
01:33:04,764 --> 01:33:09,165
Bhabhi, whatever you
said then was said in anger.

1303
01:33:09,404 --> 01:33:11,805
It was Sam's grief
that made you say it.

1304
01:33:12,164 --> 01:33:14,965
We all know you love him a lot.

1305
01:33:15,045 --> 01:33:18,285
Then why don't you.. - There is no
space for love in my life right now.

1306
01:33:18,645 --> 01:33:20,805
Love will weaken me.

1307
01:33:21,045 --> 01:33:23,406
Hate will help me fight this battle.

1308
01:33:23,846 --> 01:33:25,926
And I have to fight for Sam.

1309
01:33:26,606 --> 01:33:29,046
I can't be Khan's wife right now.

1310
01:33:29,926 --> 01:33:33,326
I知 just a mother
whose son has been killed.

1311
01:33:44,807 --> 01:33:47,727
I've had a long day, and
I've sold enough tickets.

1312
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:51,087
I値l have to call you back, alright.

1313
01:33:53,607 --> 01:33:56,848
For dinner with the
president is $500 you know.

1314
01:34:01,207 --> 01:34:03,848
That's.. that's 500.

1315
01:34:06,247 --> 01:34:09,528
What church are you from?
- Church? Church?

1316
01:34:10,089 --> 01:34:12,489
This is a Christian's only event.

1317
01:34:12,568 --> 01:34:17,209
But.. but it says, it's a fund
raiser for the drought in Africa.

1318
01:34:17,528 --> 01:34:19,049
For Christians, honey.

1319
01:34:19,128 --> 01:34:22,729
Honey, Honey keep it.

1320
01:34:24,128 --> 01:34:26,410
For those are not
Christian in Africa.

1321
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:32,330
Honey. Honey, feed Africa.

1322
01:34:46,091 --> 01:34:48,011
Offer it to him as well?

1323
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,731
Excuse me, would you
like to have some?

1324
01:35:35,854 --> 01:35:40,054
What's your name?
- Rizvan Khan. Khan.

1325
01:35:40,573 --> 01:35:42,614
I知 Imran and this is Sajida.

1326
01:35:45,134 --> 01:35:46,335
Where are you off to?

1327
01:35:46,414 --> 01:35:48,055
It's time for the bus to leave.

1328
01:35:48,134 --> 01:35:50,015
Prayer time.

1329
01:35:50,095 --> 01:35:51,255
Prayer time?

1330
01:35:51,334 --> 01:35:53,615
Now? Here?

1331
01:35:54,735 --> 01:35:58,575
You should pray depending upon
the place and the people around.

1332
01:36:01,175 --> 01:36:04,456
No. No, no.

1333
01:36:05,495 --> 01:36:07,696
Prayer should never depend
upon the place or the people.

1334
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,896
It should depend only
on your belief.

1335
01:37:46,062 --> 01:37:47,582
My God, my knee.

1336
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:49,943
Oh my God, my knee is bleeding.

1337
01:37:51,422 --> 01:37:55,263
I知 sorry,
but I can't repair your knee.

1338
01:37:55,422 --> 01:37:59,343
But can you at least help me please.
- Help?

1339
01:38:00,342 --> 01:38:02,783
Oh, yes I can do that.

1340
01:38:03,502 --> 01:38:05,064
Okay, thanks.

1341
01:38:05,263 --> 01:38:07,464
Joel, that better be you.

1342
01:38:09,664 --> 01:38:11,184
Hello.

1343
01:38:11,503 --> 01:38:13,144
You are an angel.

1344
01:38:13,223 --> 01:38:14,424
You've saved my baby.

1345
01:38:14,503 --> 01:38:16,464
He could've been out
there lying, bleeding.

1346
01:38:16,543 --> 01:38:18,024
Oh, thank you, thank you.

1347
01:38:18,104 --> 01:38:20,865
You little frisky thing, aren't you?
- Please don't hug me.

1348
01:38:20,945 --> 01:38:22,705
Alright.
- That's my Mama Jenny.

1349
01:38:22,785 --> 01:38:25,825
Always trying to hug everyone.
- Mama Jenny, please don't hug me.

1350
01:38:25,905 --> 01:38:31,505
Joel Izale Williams. I told
you not take that bicycle out.

1351
01:38:31,584 --> 01:38:34,185
Now off to bed with you.
- Yes, ma'am.

1352
01:38:34,264 --> 01:38:37,266
You. You Mr. Repair man.
- Rizvan.

1353
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:40,346
Rizvan. Oh, you hungry child?
You want little dinner?

1354
01:38:40,425 --> 01:38:42,906
No, I want lots of dinner.

1355
01:38:45,106 --> 01:38:47,066
First we've got to get
you out of those clothes.

1356
01:38:47,145 --> 01:38:50,226
You want me to be naked?
- No, no, no.

1357
01:38:50,305 --> 01:38:52,627
Just get this cleaned up,
that's all.

1358
01:38:52,707 --> 01:38:56,347
Funny hair Joel and his
Mama Jenny are good people.

1359
01:38:56,627 --> 01:38:59,707
Mama Jenny is strict
and a little fat too.

1360
01:38:59,787 --> 01:39:01,827
But I like her.

1361
01:39:11,948 --> 01:39:13,868
Mama Jenny's elder son, James..

1362
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:17,548
..was killed two
months ago in the Iraq war.

1363
01:39:20,587 --> 01:39:22,748
But he loved his country.

1364
01:39:24,629 --> 01:39:28,149
Mama Jenny too asked me
about Sameer.

1365
01:39:28,789 --> 01:39:32,109
Sam has been gone for 1 79 days..

1366
01:39:32,188 --> 01:39:35,869
..and for the first time, someone
made a mention of him to me.

1367
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:43,670
Poor baby.

1368
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,990
Poor baby

1369
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:56,431
Mama Jenny and Funny Hair Joel live
in Wilhemina, Tarrow country, Georgia.

1370
01:39:58,350 --> 01:40:04,551
This small town has 204
people and 754 cows exactly.

1371
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:10,872
All the people here
work at the dairy farm.

1372
01:40:10,952 --> 01:40:14,432
And pray at the Church Of Rock.

1373
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:23,872
Today, there's a memorial service
for all the soldiers killed in Iraq.

1374
01:40:28,673 --> 01:40:33,513
Mama Jenny has added Sameer's
name to the list of martyrs.

1375
01:40:35,953 --> 01:40:41,313
Mama Jenny said by
remembering and talking about them..

1376
01:40:41,392 --> 01:40:43,834
..we can get closer to them.

1377
01:40:43,914 --> 01:40:45,954
Letters just stopped.

1378
01:40:46,674 --> 01:40:49,914
My mom's never been the same,
she cries all the time.

1379
01:40:51,114 --> 01:40:53,354
I loved my brother so much,
and I just want him to know..

1380
01:40:53,433 --> 01:40:56,114
..if he's out there,
that I miss him.

1381
01:40:56,353 --> 01:40:57,474
He's always..

1382
01:40:57,554 --> 01:41:03,355
I too tried to get closer to Sam.

1383
01:41:04,354 --> 01:41:07,555
Sameer Rathod Khan, my son.

1384
01:41:08,075 --> 01:41:12,235
Weight 56 kilogram,
blood group O positive.

1385
01:41:12,474 --> 01:41:14,956
Sameer loved Xbox and soccer.

1386
01:41:15,036 --> 01:41:19,396
He loved his soccer shoes so
much that he would sleep in them.

1387
01:41:19,475 --> 01:41:21,916
That was the only bad habit he had.

1388
01:41:22,155 --> 01:41:25,196
Sam was six years old
when I married his mother.

1389
01:41:25,275 --> 01:41:27,396
Sameer was a good son.

1390
01:41:27,475 --> 01:41:32,597
He did not mind sharing
his mom's love with me.

1391
01:41:33,276 --> 01:41:37,997
But I couldn't be
such a good dad to him.

1392
01:41:38,637 --> 01:41:43,597
Other dads sense their children's
unsaid needs and fulfil them.

1393
01:41:44,037 --> 01:41:47,518
But I can't sense
unexpressed feelings.

1394
01:41:47,878 --> 01:41:49,878
So, I couldn't fulfil them.

1395
01:41:50,958 --> 01:41:53,638
But.. but, Sam never complained.

1396
01:41:53,718 --> 01:41:56,758
He never complained.

1397
01:41:58,517 --> 01:42:00,559
Sam had one more bad habit.

1398
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:02,439
He told us only good things.

1399
01:42:02,518 --> 01:42:04,639
He always hid bad news from us.

1400
01:42:05,799 --> 01:42:09,199
He would never tell me when my
favorite team Manchester United lost.

1401
01:42:09,278 --> 01:42:10,799
Never.

1402
01:42:10,879 --> 01:42:14,319
Unless we had a bet.
Then he would tell me.

1403
01:42:14,558 --> 01:42:19,840
Then I would I have to give him
his mint chocolate-chip ice cream.

1404
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,480
Two scoops.

1405
01:42:23,519 --> 01:42:25,400
Two scoops, always.

1406
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,480
Two scoops.

1407
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:34,081
On 27th November 2007,
he was killed.

1408
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,281
He was 13 years, nine
months and four days old.

1409
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:43,401
Sameer was not only my son,
he was my dearest friend.

1410
01:42:43,721 --> 01:42:46,561
Actually, my only friend.

1411
01:42:46,641 --> 01:42:48,002
My..

1412
01:42:48,642 --> 01:42:53,402
My.. only best friend.

1413
01:43:01,082 --> 01:43:04,803
I知 sure Allah is happy that
Sam is with him in heaven.

1414
01:43:04,883 --> 01:43:11,843
I.. Mama Jenny, I
don't know what to say.

1415
01:43:13,482 --> 01:43:17,323
I don't want to say anymore.

1416
01:43:52,886 --> 01:43:54,526
Come on, Rizvan.

1417
01:45:29,251 --> 01:45:30,452
Okay.
- Okay.

1418
01:45:30,531 --> 01:45:32,052
Bye.

1419
01:45:32,132 --> 01:45:35,252
Bye, Rizvan.
- Bye.

1420
01:45:35,331 --> 01:45:36,652
Bye.
- Bye.

1421
01:45:36,732 --> 01:45:38,692
Okay, okay bye.

1422
01:45:38,772 --> 01:45:41,213
God bless you, my son.

1423
01:45:42,093 --> 01:45:44,493
What do you mean
you're shutting the case?

1424
01:45:44,572 --> 01:45:46,453
Understand it's been six months.

1425
01:45:46,532 --> 01:45:48,933
Okay, no witnesses, no suspects,
no evidence.

1426
01:45:49,013 --> 01:45:51,373
There's been no movement
on this case, Mrs. Khan.

1427
01:45:51,452 --> 01:45:52,973
Look, I really have no choice.

1428
01:45:53,053 --> 01:45:55,213
But you know, maybe.. maybe
there's somebody at school..

1429
01:45:55,292 --> 01:45:56,374
..who will remember something.

1430
01:45:56,453 --> 01:45:58,494
You know, maybe you can go
door to door, class to class.

1431
01:45:58,573 --> 01:46:00,214
Door to door and homes,
and something..

1432
01:46:00,293 --> 01:46:02,614
You know I've done that already.
- But, you know..

1433
01:46:02,694 --> 01:46:04,174
Maybe there's something
else that you'll find.

1434
01:46:04,253 --> 01:46:05,934
You see these files?

1435
01:46:06,014 --> 01:46:08,494
These are all those
waiting for justice too.

1436
01:46:08,934 --> 01:46:11,335
Look, I知 sorry,
Mrs. Khan. I truly am.

1437
01:46:11,414 --> 01:46:14,135
Sometimes there really
are no answers. - No.

1438
01:46:14,895 --> 01:46:16,615
I don't accept that.

1439
01:46:17,174 --> 01:46:19,215
I do not accept that.

1440
01:46:19,294 --> 01:46:21,335
There has to be an answer.

1441
01:46:23,015 --> 01:46:26,095
And if you can't find it, I will.

1442
01:46:48,496 --> 01:46:49,697
Hi.
- Hi.

1443
01:46:49,777 --> 01:46:52,497
I知 looking for any lead on
the boys who killed my son.

1444
01:46:52,576 --> 01:46:53,857
Any information at all.
My number is there. - Okay.

1445
01:47:08,337 --> 01:47:10,978
I have reached Los Angeles now.

1446
01:47:11,818 --> 01:47:15,779
The President is coming
visit the college campus here.

1447
01:47:20,139 --> 01:47:22,379
I have reached
three days before him..

1448
01:47:22,458 --> 01:47:25,419
..so that I don't miss
him this time around.

1449
01:47:30,259 --> 01:47:33,460
I am going to pray that
Allah wills it so too.

1450
01:47:43,299 --> 01:47:45,661
Listen, listen, listen brothers.

1451
01:47:46,141 --> 01:47:48,021
We are digressing.

1452
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:50,661
I have said it before.

1453
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:55,341
I have no problem with
Christians or the Jews.

1454
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:00,261
In fact, I have no problems
with our Hindu brothers too.

1455
01:48:00,861 --> 01:48:06,262
I treat a lot of Hindu
patients in St. Benedict's hospital.

1456
01:48:06,662 --> 01:48:09,822
I get angry only
when this same grace..

1457
01:48:09,902 --> 01:48:12,502
..is not
reciprocated towards us Muslims.

1458
01:48:12,581 --> 01:48:14,862
My blood boils..

1459
01:48:14,942 --> 01:48:21,183
..when Israeli Jews
massacre our Palestinian brothers.

1460
01:48:21,703 --> 01:48:23,263
Or when Hindus in India..

1461
01:48:23,342 --> 01:48:26,583
..cut our women and children
to pieces with their swords.

1462
01:48:26,663 --> 01:48:30,983
That's when my blood boils.

1463
01:48:31,262 --> 01:48:33,744
Doesn't your blood boil? Answer me.

1464
01:48:33,824 --> 01:48:35,464
Doesn't your blood boil?
- It does. It does.

1465
01:48:35,543 --> 01:48:36,784
It does. It does.

1466
01:48:36,864 --> 01:48:40,544
So, do something then. Do something!

1467
01:48:41,784 --> 01:48:46,344
I, Dr. Faisal Rehman,
take an oath that I知 ready.

1468
01:48:46,423 --> 01:48:47,704
Are you people ready? Are you?

1469
01:48:47,784 --> 01:48:50,545
Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are.

1470
01:48:50,624 --> 01:48:51,985
Are you people ready?

1471
01:48:52,065 --> 01:48:55,425
Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are.

1472
01:48:58,865 --> 01:49:05,466
Mighty Allah had even asked
Ibrahim to sacrifice his son.

1473
01:49:06,545 --> 01:49:12,866
And without asking a single question,
Ibrahim agreed to sacrifice him.

1474
01:49:14,225 --> 01:49:17,266
It's our turn today.

1475
01:49:17,465 --> 01:49:21,587
It's our duty to let our blood
flow for the cause of Islam.

1476
01:49:21,787 --> 01:49:23,747
This is what Allah demands!

1477
01:49:23,827 --> 01:49:27,347
This is what Islam demands!

1478
01:49:27,426 --> 01:49:31,867
No, no, no, no.

1479
01:49:31,947 --> 01:49:33,507
No.

1480
01:49:33,787 --> 01:49:36,908
You are lying.

1481
01:49:37,108 --> 01:49:38,788
Wait.. Wait..

1482
01:49:39,028 --> 01:49:40,628
Why, brother?

1483
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:43,868
Don't you believe that the Lord
had asked for Ismail's sacrifice?

1484
01:49:43,948 --> 01:49:45,828
No, no.

1485
01:49:46,948 --> 01:49:48,588
My Ammi (mother) has told me the story.

1486
01:49:49,668 --> 01:49:53,709
Saint Ibrahim did not doubt
the compassion of the Lord.

1487
01:49:54,149 --> 01:49:55,549
No, no, no. No.

1488
01:49:57,428 --> 01:50:00,469
The story is an example of his
immense strong faith and belief.

1489
01:50:01,109 --> 01:50:03,109
And that's the reason..

1490
01:50:03,588 --> 01:50:06,910
..why despite being incited
by a stranger repeatedly..

1491
01:50:07,309 --> 01:50:10,310
..Saint Ibrahim did not waver
from his path of righteousness.

1492
01:50:10,389 --> 01:50:11,470
No.

1493
01:50:11,549 --> 01:50:13,470
He didn't listen to the stranger.

1494
01:50:13,549 --> 01:50:17,910
He was sure Allah would never allow
the blood of his progeny to be shed.

1495
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:20,630
And he was right.

1496
01:50:21,549 --> 01:50:25,351
The mighty Allah saved
Ismail's life.

1497
01:50:26,190 --> 01:50:29,951
My Ammi (mother) also said, ''Rizvan..

1498
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:37,111
..this story shows that the
path of Allah is that of love..

1499
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:42,112
..not of hatred and war.''

1500
01:50:44,631 --> 01:50:47,152
You are lying.

1501
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:50,293
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
- You are lying.

1502
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:51,832
Look. The meaning of
the story is clear.

1503
01:50:51,866 --> 01:50:54,933
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
- Our brother here speaks the truth.

1504
01:50:55,392 --> 01:50:56,793
Allah's path is that of compassion.

1505
01:50:57,073 --> 01:50:59,393
That's why his loved ones are called
'blessed by the compassionate! '

1506
01:50:59,459 --> 01:51:01,139
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
Ask him who was that stranger?

1507
01:51:02,793 --> 01:51:03,952
I知 not lying!

1508
01:51:03,953 --> 01:51:05,033
You are lying!

1509
01:51:05,113 --> 01:51:06,713
Our times demand..
- Ask him..

1510
01:51:06,793 --> 01:51:09,153
The stranger who tried to
veer Ibrahim from his path..

1511
01:51:09,232 --> 01:51:10,794
..was he an infidel?

1512
01:51:10,874 --> 01:51:11,994
How does it matter who he was?

1513
01:51:12,074 --> 01:51:13,314
But Doctor, who was he?

1514
01:51:13,393 --> 01:51:15,234
Listen I can explain everything.

1515
01:51:15,553 --> 01:51:18,594
Brother, tell us who he was.

1516
01:51:24,794 --> 01:51:30,195
Satan! Satan! Satan!

1517
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:48,076
The world is strange, Mandira.

1518
01:51:48,156 --> 01:51:50,716
The more I try to understand it..

1519
01:51:50,796 --> 01:51:53,236
..the lesser I understand.

1520
01:51:54,036 --> 01:51:56,356
I miss you.

1521
01:51:59,997 --> 01:52:01,797
Hello.
- Hello.

1522
01:52:02,877 --> 01:52:05,477
Bhai (brother) .. You? Where are you?

1523
01:52:06,276 --> 01:52:09,797
FBI. Do you have
a number for the FBl?

1524
01:52:10,117 --> 01:52:12,478
FBI ? Why?

1525
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:39,799
Please.

1526
01:52:39,879 --> 01:52:41,439
It's our college,
and they are pushing us around.

1527
01:52:41,518 --> 01:52:43,920
I wonder why they are so excited.
That too for this President.

1528
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,880
Lousy pods of garlic!

1529
01:52:46,559 --> 01:52:47,840
I love it.

1530
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,720
There are no better cusswords
than Indian ones. - Really.

1531
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:03,721
Boys and girls.

1532
01:53:03,801 --> 01:53:06,801
Come on. This is the man
you waited for hours to see.

1533
01:53:06,881 --> 01:53:09,321
Let's give him a
warm round of applause.

1534
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:12,761
I present to you, the man,
the legend.

1535
01:53:12,841 --> 01:53:16,202
The president of the
United States of America.

1536
01:53:17,682 --> 01:53:19,722
Alright, yes.

1537
01:53:23,922 --> 01:53:25,482
Alright, come on everybody.

1538
01:53:25,561 --> 01:53:28,962
Let's give this guy a nice
warm round of applause..

1539
01:53:29,042 --> 01:53:30,322
..for his esteemed support.

1540
01:53:30,401 --> 01:53:31,723
And there he is.

1541
01:53:33,602 --> 01:53:36,763
Alright everybody, alright.

1542
01:53:36,843 --> 01:53:39,443
Everybody, make some noise.

1543
01:53:39,522 --> 01:53:41,043
President.

1544
01:53:42,883 --> 01:53:44,923
Mr. President.

1545
01:53:45,723 --> 01:53:47,884
Mr. President.

1546
01:53:54,044 --> 01:53:55,804
Mr. President.

1547
01:53:59,243 --> 01:54:02,925
My name Khan,
and I知 not a terrorist.

1548
01:54:09,085 --> 01:54:10,845
Mr. President.

1549
01:54:12,125 --> 01:54:15,205
My name Khan,
and I知 not a terrorist.

1550
01:54:15,965 --> 01:54:17,485
Did he just say terrorist?

1551
01:54:17,565 --> 01:54:19,606
I知 not a terrorist.
- Terrorist!

1552
01:54:19,686 --> 01:54:25,446
He says he's a terrorist.
- I知 not a terrorist.

1553
01:54:31,166 --> 01:54:32,686
Move.

1554
01:54:53,647 --> 01:54:55,448
Don't move.

1555
01:54:55,888 --> 01:54:57,328
I got him.

1556
01:55:10,809 --> 01:55:12,289
Don't move, man. Don't move.

1557
01:55:12,368 --> 01:55:14,809
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1558
01:55:19,689 --> 01:55:23,170
My name is Khan, and
I知 not a terrorist.

1559
01:55:23,409 --> 01:55:25,130
I don't understand.

1560
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:27,170
He is strange.

1561
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:29,970
First, he was standing silently.

1562
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:31,210
Then all of a sudden,
he was screaming.

1563
01:55:31,289 --> 01:55:32,450
And what was he screaming..

1564
01:55:32,529 --> 01:55:35,810
I知 not a terrorist.
I知 not a terrorist. Strange.

1565
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:37,611
There's something more to his story.

1566
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:40,291
Yes. But why are
we after this story?

1567
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:42,731
Listen, Raj. This
can't be our project.

1568
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:45,531
I don't want to get into
this Khan story. I知 scared.

1569
01:55:45,610 --> 01:55:47,371
Scared because he is a Khan?

1570
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:49,771
lf he was a Khanna,
you wouldn't be, right?

1571
01:55:49,851 --> 01:55:51,291
What do you mean?

1572
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:53,732
You know what I知 saying, Komal.

1573
01:55:55,852 --> 01:55:58,092
Listen, this is
going to be my project.

1574
01:55:58,411 --> 01:56:00,012
Are you with me?

1575
01:56:04,491 --> 01:56:06,732
He's been following the
President for some weeks now.

1576
01:56:06,812 --> 01:56:10,213
And we.. frankly can't know
whether he's a 'Jihadi' or not.

1577
01:56:11,893 --> 01:56:14,293
I have made a mistake again,
Mandira.

1578
01:56:14,372 --> 01:56:17,253
And now, the
President is angry with me.

1579
01:56:17,332 --> 01:56:19,733
He has even told
the judge about it.

1580
01:56:20,173 --> 01:56:24,294
That's why the judge has
asked me to be shut away.

1581
01:56:35,293 --> 01:56:39,375
He has also ordered that
I should meet a psychiatrist.

1582
01:56:39,654 --> 01:56:42,775
He says he will meet me after that.

1583
01:56:43,135 --> 01:56:46,935
I will tell him then
that I'm not an enemy.

1584
01:56:47,175 --> 01:56:48,655
I'm not evil.

1585
01:56:48,735 --> 01:56:51,695
I am unable to say
anything now, Mandira.

1586
01:56:53,414 --> 01:56:55,896
I'm very scared.

1587
01:57:01,936 --> 01:57:03,296
His name is Rizvan Khan.
- Rizvan Khan. - Yes.

1588
01:57:04,375 --> 01:57:05,816
They are not saying
anything beyond that right now.

1589
01:57:05,896 --> 01:57:08,216
I knew the police wasn't
going to tell us anything.. Now?

1590
01:57:08,295 --> 01:57:11,017
Now what? There are
other ways of finding out.

1591
01:57:11,376 --> 01:57:13,057
Come on, let's go.

1592
01:57:13,977 --> 01:57:15,657
Guys, you know this is illegal.

1593
01:57:15,737 --> 01:57:18,057
Yes. And you never do
anything illegal, right?

1594
01:57:18,496 --> 01:57:23,177
Here. Complete
information on Rizvan Khan.

1595
01:57:23,256 --> 01:57:24,817
House, work address,
social security number.

1596
01:57:24,897 --> 01:57:26,058
Credit records, salary statement.

1597
01:57:26,138 --> 01:57:27,498
In short, his entire life!

1598
01:57:27,577 --> 01:57:30,098
Wow, dude, Inder you're a rockstar.
- Yes, thanks.

1599
01:57:30,178 --> 01:57:31,258
Bye.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1600
01:57:31,337 --> 01:57:32,458
Stay out of jail.

1601
01:57:33,138 --> 01:57:34,698
Yeah, I値l call you back. Bye.

1602
01:57:34,778 --> 01:57:37,258
Yeah, I知 telling you, it's a
great piece for your paper, okay.

1603
01:57:37,337 --> 01:57:39,018
This man, Rizvan Khan,
is a simple guy.

1604
01:57:39,098 --> 01:57:40,858
He sells beauty
products for a living.

1605
01:57:40,938 --> 01:57:42,139
Listen.

1606
01:57:42,218 --> 01:57:43,339
He's no enemy combatant.

1607
01:57:43,418 --> 01:57:44,499
That's what you think.

1608
01:57:44,578 --> 01:57:47,339
I just interviewed an extremist
in a Kabul prison last year.

1609
01:57:47,418 --> 01:57:50,459
He was just a tailor.
There's no story here, bud.

1610
01:57:55,099 --> 01:57:57,220
This place is strange, Mandira.

1611
01:57:57,299 --> 01:58:01,860
There are no windows to any room
and the bathrooms don't have a door.

1612
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:05,180
And the toilet has a lock.

1613
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:10,700
My eyes burn and I feel sleepy too.

1614
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:14,501
At times, it's very hot here.

1615
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,581
At other times, it is very cold.

1616
01:58:16,660 --> 01:58:20,661
I told them I would
repair their air conditioner..

1617
01:58:21,021 --> 01:58:22,781
..but they won't let me.

1618
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:27,101
They don't even tell me
the time so that I can pray.

1619
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:29,862
That's why every time
I feel scared..

1620
01:58:30,102 --> 01:58:33,062
I bow and pray.

1621
01:58:33,902 --> 01:58:36,382
Oh, sorry guys, sorry.
Give me two minutes, okay.

1622
01:58:36,461 --> 01:58:38,142
Look, I've looked over the details.

1623
01:58:38,221 --> 01:58:39,702
I'm not really interested, but..

1624
01:58:39,782 --> 01:58:41,542
..why don't you try
Bobby Abuja, at PBC.

1625
01:58:41,621 --> 01:58:44,343
He might able to
help you. Okay. Alright.

1626
01:58:44,542 --> 01:58:46,943
But why? Why do you want
to meet the President?

1627
01:58:47,023 --> 01:58:49,463
Why do you know so
much about the President?

1628
01:58:49,542 --> 01:58:51,863
Why were you reading
up on the President?

1629
01:58:52,183 --> 01:58:54,023
Do you know these people?

1630
01:58:54,103 --> 01:58:56,223
Azhar Mahmood, Omar Khan..

1631
01:58:56,302 --> 01:58:58,503
I think they are angry..

1632
01:58:58,582 --> 01:59:02,344
..because I'm not able to answer
their questions about the Al Qaeda.

1633
01:59:02,423 --> 01:59:05,384
But I don't know
anything about them.

1634
01:59:05,623 --> 01:59:09,824
Mandira, I should have
read up on Al Qaeda before.

1635
01:59:09,904 --> 01:59:12,584
Why? Why were you at
the Rally? Okay, what?

1636
01:59:15,263 --> 01:59:17,265
It's time for his session with me.

1637
01:59:17,464 --> 01:59:19,425
As ordered by the judge.

1638
01:59:19,985 --> 01:59:23,785
Do you really buy this, ''My wife
told me to meet the President'' shit?''

1639
01:59:23,865 --> 01:59:25,985
Would it matter if I said yes?

1640
01:59:27,344 --> 01:59:28,545
Hello.
- Hi.

1641
01:59:28,624 --> 01:59:31,346
Raj.
- Raj, Bobby Abuja. Please sit.

1642
01:59:34,585 --> 01:59:37,146
I didn't have your number or I would
have called to tell you that..

1643
01:59:37,225 --> 01:59:40,786
..I can't cover the
Rizvan Khan story.

1644
01:59:40,986 --> 01:59:43,026
I have a busy schedule.

1645
01:59:43,505 --> 01:59:45,746
I have no time for
another two months.

1646
01:59:46,706 --> 01:59:49,507
You know otherwise, you know
I would've done something.

1647
01:59:49,586 --> 01:59:52,067
But.. you know what I mean?

1648
01:59:52,147 --> 01:59:54,387
lf you don't mind me asking, sir.

1649
01:59:54,987 --> 01:59:57,587
Was this photograph
taken before 9/11?

1650
01:59:59,666 --> 02:00:01,547
Yes. Why?

1651
02:00:03,948 --> 02:00:05,108
What's so funny?

1652
02:00:05,188 --> 02:00:08,788
No, it's not funny at all actually.

1653
02:00:10,148 --> 02:00:13,948
They confused a Sikh for a Muslim
and you changed your entire life.

1654
02:00:14,868 --> 02:00:17,788
And here, they are not even
treating a Muslim like a human..

1655
02:00:18,307 --> 02:00:20,149
..and you aren't able
to change your schedule?

1656
02:00:22,588 --> 02:00:24,269
Thank you for your time, sir.

1657
02:00:34,910 --> 02:00:37,230
You have one new message.

1658
02:00:37,309 --> 02:00:40,230
Hi Raj, this is
Bobby Abuja from PBC.

1659
02:00:40,589 --> 02:00:42,270
Don't forget to
watch the news tomorrow.

1660
02:00:43,790 --> 02:00:46,670
My name is Khan, and
I知 not a terrorist.

1661
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:48,190
Mr. President.

1662
02:00:48,269 --> 02:00:50,431
Rizvan Khan of Banville
California was arrested..

1663
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:53,511
..on June 15th at the
CLA Presidential Rally.

1664
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:54,911
He has been accused
of being a terrorist..

1665
02:00:54,991 --> 02:00:56,831
..and has been jailed
for the last 15 days.

1666
02:00:56,911 --> 02:00:58,231
Without any evidence.

1667
02:00:58,310 --> 02:01:00,431
And without legal representation.

1668
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:03,471
And today, we have with us Mr.
and Mrs. Zakir Khan.

1669
02:01:03,550 --> 02:01:04,751
Family of Rizvan Khan.

1670
02:01:04,831 --> 02:01:07,712
lmran, the Khan from the bus is
on PBC. Quick, switch on the TV!

1671
02:01:07,792 --> 02:01:10,312
very angry and very upset.

1672
02:01:10,992 --> 02:01:13,712
I mean, how can anyone
call him a terrorist?

1673
02:01:14,591 --> 02:01:16,192
That too without any evidence.

1674
02:01:16,271 --> 02:01:19,432
Tell them how last month
Bhai (brother) called for the FBI.

1675
02:01:20,032 --> 02:01:23,073
Bhai (brother) had called last month.
He wanted the number for the FBI.

1676
02:01:23,153 --> 02:01:27,593
He wanted to report some terrorist
recruiter called, Dr. Faisal Rehman.

1677
02:01:28,232 --> 02:01:31,553
Yo, how's business, asshole?

1678
02:01:32,312 --> 02:01:34,113
Fuck you.

1679
02:01:34,232 --> 02:01:36,914
I mean we're told to
report suspicious characters.

1680
02:01:36,994 --> 02:01:39,754
Participate in.. protecting
the country from extremists.

1681
02:01:39,834 --> 02:01:41,434
And then when we do that..

1682
02:01:41,513 --> 02:01:43,874
..we're just put into
the jail, like my brother.

1683
02:01:43,954 --> 02:01:47,074
Yeah, this is judge Preston,
can you give me the FBI please?

1684
02:01:47,633 --> 02:01:50,714
The question over here is, not why
he's trying to meet the President.

1685
02:01:50,874 --> 02:01:52,755
The question is, what's
wrong in an ordinary citizen..

1686
02:01:52,835 --> 02:01:54,995
..wanting to meet the
President of his country?

1687
02:01:55,474 --> 02:01:59,115
Or is it just wrong for
a Muslim man to even try?

1688
02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:04,275
And as Rizvan Khan
continues to be treated as guilty..

1689
02:02:04,354 --> 02:02:09,316
..until proven innocent, for
PBC News, my name is Bobby Abuja.

1690
02:02:09,756 --> 02:02:11,276
And I知 not a terrorist.

1691
02:02:11,355 --> 02:02:13,836
He is right. Zakir Bhai (brother) is right.

1692
02:02:14,196 --> 02:02:18,596
We are told to report to the
government any information..

1693
02:02:18,675 --> 02:02:21,196
..we have on any terrorist activity.

1694
02:02:22,196 --> 02:02:25,397
And when we do that,
what happens is before you.

1695
02:02:25,837 --> 02:02:28,757
Why is this being
asked over and over again?

1696
02:02:28,837 --> 02:02:31,397
''Why does Khan want to
meet the President?''

1697
02:02:31,797 --> 02:02:36,397
What's the harm if an ordinary
citizen wants to meet the President?

1698
02:02:36,476 --> 02:02:38,077
What's wrong?

1699
02:02:38,157 --> 02:02:41,598
Or then tell us clearly that
Muslims don't have right to do so.

1700
02:02:44,317 --> 02:02:46,558
Yes, good afternoon.
This is Tracy Brennan..

1701
02:02:46,637 --> 02:02:49,678
..Chairperson of the American
Autistic society in San Francisco.

1702
02:02:49,918 --> 02:02:52,198
Would you put me on to your
officer in-charge of the..

1703
02:02:52,277 --> 02:02:54,798
..Rizvan Khan case, please?

1704
02:02:54,878 --> 02:02:57,359
This is about the Rizvan Khan case.

1705
02:02:57,438 --> 02:03:00,559
Any information you
have on Rizvan Khan.

1706
02:03:00,638 --> 02:03:02,159
Look I've been calling all morning.

1707
02:03:02,238 --> 02:03:05,519
I need to know where Rizvan
Khan has been taken, please.

1708
02:03:08,678 --> 02:03:09,839
Hello, hello.

1709
02:03:09,919 --> 02:03:11,440
My name is Rizvan Khan.

1710
02:03:11,519 --> 02:03:13,000
Khan, from the epiglottis.

1711
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:15,160
I want to report a man.

1712
02:03:15,239 --> 02:03:17,040
I have to report a man.

1713
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,920
I met him at a downtown mosque.

1714
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,800
I met him at a downtown mosque.

1715
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:23,200
His name is Dr. Faisal Rehman.

1716
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:26,360
Faisal Rehman, he works at
the St. Benedicts Hospital.

1717
02:03:26,439 --> 02:03:28,121
He is a bad man.

1718
02:03:28,201 --> 02:03:30,041
He is a very bad man.

1719
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:35,161
Your call helped
them arrest Dr. Rehman.

1720
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,761
Eight others were arrested with him.

1721
02:03:38,801 --> 02:03:40,961
It's a big catch, Rizvan.

1722
02:03:41,121 --> 02:03:42,682
You are free to go now.

1723
02:03:42,762 --> 02:03:44,482
You are free.

1724
02:04:02,043 --> 02:04:03,603
Hey, watch it.

1725
02:04:09,562 --> 02:04:12,683
Finally, Rizvan Khan's
innocence has been proved.

1726
02:04:12,883 --> 02:04:15,164
He will be freed in a few moments.

1727
02:04:15,924 --> 02:04:18,844
A small, but increasing group of
supporters have gathered here today..

1728
02:04:18,924 --> 02:04:20,804
..and have shown no
signs of leaving.

1729
02:04:20,884 --> 02:04:25,324
Bano, come quickly! Rizvan Khan
has been released. He's been freed.

1730
02:04:32,725 --> 02:04:35,965
Bare Essentials Mystique,
Mandira's perfume..

1731

35 dollars, 99 cents.

1732
02:04:41,725 --> 02:04:43,885
Hey, you famous or something?
- On sale now at Walmart.

1733
02:04:43,965 --> 02:04:45,966
You some Guru or something?

1734
02:04:46,046 --> 02:04:48,366
Some crazy lady was just
here shouting about your..

1735
02:04:48,445 --> 02:04:51,166
..innocence and what not.
- Crazy lady. Mandira.

1736
02:04:51,245 --> 02:04:53,046
Mandira was here.

1737
02:04:53,126 --> 02:04:54,926
Crazy lady, Mandira was here.

1738
02:04:55,006 --> 02:04:56,446
Where did she go?

1739
02:04:56,525 --> 02:04:57,686
Where did she go?

1740
02:04:57,766 --> 02:04:59,086
Where did she go?

1741
02:04:59,166 --> 02:05:01,567
Where did she go?
- She went out the back way.

1742
02:05:08,727 --> 02:05:10,247
Mandira.

1743
02:05:11,606 --> 02:05:13,247
Mandira.

1744
02:05:18,808 --> 02:05:20,208
Mandira.

1745
02:06:20,491 --> 02:06:23,732
Sorry Mandira, I couldn't meet you..

1746
02:06:23,972 --> 02:06:26,972
..since I haven't
fulfilled my promise to you yet.

1747
02:06:30,172 --> 02:06:34,492
But somehow Mandira,
as soon as I saw you..

1748
02:06:34,571 --> 02:06:37,413
..the pain in my chest vanished.

1749
02:06:41,572 --> 02:06:43,253
Where did Rizvan Khan go?

1750
02:06:43,332 --> 02:06:46,493
And why does he want to meet
the President? No one knows.

1751
02:06:46,572 --> 02:06:48,253
So why he wants to
meet the President..

1752
02:06:48,332 --> 02:06:51,494
..and what is his message about
continues to remain a mystery.

1753
02:06:51,573 --> 02:06:53,774
This is Bobby Abuja, PBC news.
- Yeah, so..

1754
02:06:53,854 --> 02:06:55,454
Thank you so much for
this internship, sir.

1755
02:06:55,533 --> 02:06:56,774
We promise not to let you..

1756
02:06:56,854 --> 02:06:59,174
Thank me later..
First find this Khan..

1757
02:06:59,253 --> 02:07:01,814
His story has moved
thousands of Muslims.

1758
02:07:02,533 --> 02:07:04,454
I wish I knew where Bhai (brother) was, Raj.

1759
02:07:04,533 --> 02:07:06,295
He calls me.

1760
02:07:06,975 --> 02:07:10,415
Yeah. Yeah, next time he
calls me I'll let you know.

1761
02:07:14,454 --> 02:07:16,455
Yo, Paki loser.

1762
02:07:25,455 --> 02:07:28,416
Hey! My name is Abdul!

1763
02:07:28,936 --> 02:07:30,376
You want a piece of me.

1764
02:07:32,415 --> 02:07:34,296
You show me the finger?
- Enough, okay buddy.

1765
02:07:34,375 --> 02:07:36,456
Come, I値l show you once
and for all. - I知 done.

1766
02:07:36,535 --> 02:07:38,217
Come I値l show you!

1767
02:07:38,616 --> 02:07:40,137
What you looking at?

1768
02:07:57,497 --> 02:08:02,178
For a while now I have
been fighting with myself.

1769
02:08:02,377 --> 02:08:07,858
I teach you about identity when my
own has been changed so drastically.

1770
02:08:09,819 --> 02:08:13,459
My hijab (veils) is not just
my religious identity.

1771
02:08:14,698 --> 02:08:16,659
It is a part of my existence.

1772
02:08:17,578 --> 02:08:19,459
It's me.

1773
02:08:21,338 --> 02:08:23,899
Khan stayed in room 22 only.

1774
02:08:24,219 --> 02:08:26,020
You want to stay in the same room?

1775
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:30,540
Only 25 dollars extra,
to be a part of history.

1776
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:33,980
And mind you, my name is Jitesh.

1777
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:36,300
And I知 not a terrorist.

1778
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:39,660
Mummy, I want to tell
you something today.

1779
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:42,541
Today I知 proud to
be a computer hacker.

1780
02:08:44,021 --> 02:08:45,501
Ya.. I have eaten already.

1781
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:47,581
At least listen to
what I知 saying first.

1782
02:08:55,941 --> 02:09:01,622
Hurricane Molly.. now
moving at 125 miles per hour..

1783
02:09:01,701 --> 02:09:03,622
..has severely hit
the southern coast.

1784
02:09:03,701 --> 02:09:06,302
And the authorities around the
southern region have been alerted.

1785
02:09:06,381 --> 02:09:08,982
We now go live to Alex,
who's on location.

1786
02:09:09,062 --> 02:09:10,182
Thank you, Janice.

1787
02:09:10,261 --> 02:09:11,823
Attention all passengers..

1788
02:09:11,903 --> 02:09:15,103
..E- 52 bus to Portland has
been delayed by 10 minutes.

1789
02:09:15,183 --> 02:09:18,103
Again, E-52 Portland bus
has a ten minute delay.

1790
02:09:18,183 --> 02:09:19,663
We regret the inconvenience.

1791
02:09:20,143 --> 02:09:21,863
We have a fresh update,
this just in.

1792
02:09:21,943 --> 02:09:24,783
We've news that the hurricane
has hit Wilhemina, Georgia.

1793
02:09:24,863 --> 02:09:27,343
I repeat, Wilhemina,
Georgia has been hit.

1794
02:09:27,543 --> 02:09:29,704
Full on by hurricane Molly.

1795
02:09:30,024 --> 02:09:32,944
At this point we don't
have any indication as to..

1796
02:09:33,024 --> 02:09:39,984
Mama Jenny.. Mama
Jenny I have to go to her.

1797
02:09:53,945 --> 02:09:57,225
Raj.. Bhai (brother) called.. You wanted
to know where he was, didn't you?

1798
02:09:57,304 --> 02:09:58,385
Yes, Zakir bhai (brother) ?

1799
02:09:58,464 --> 02:10:00,146
He's going to Wilhemina.

1800
02:10:01,665 --> 02:10:04,746
Wilhemina? That's in Georgia, right?

1801
02:10:04,826 --> 02:10:06,386
Ya.. Somewhere there.

1802
02:10:06,465 --> 02:10:07,586
What is he doing there?

1803
02:10:07,665 --> 02:10:09,946
He said that he has to
meet some Mama Jenny there.

1804
02:10:40,988 --> 02:10:45,468
Mandira, there's going to be a
delay in meeting the President.

1805
02:10:46,628 --> 02:10:48,909
I have come to Wilhemina, Georgia.

1806
02:10:48,989 --> 02:10:53,069
Mama Jenny and Funny
hair Joel are in trouble.

1807
02:10:53,268 --> 02:10:56,029
There's too much water here,
Mandira..

1808
02:10:56,109 --> 02:10:59,789
..and I don't think
Mama Jenny can swim.

1809
02:10:59,869 --> 02:11:02,190
She's a little fat.

1810
02:11:56,233 --> 02:11:58,793
Rizvan. Mama Rizvan.

1811
02:11:59,233 --> 02:12:02,993
Rizvan. What are you doing here?

1812
02:12:03,272 --> 02:12:09,594
Mama Jenny, I知 happy, Funny
hair Joel and you are not dead.

1813
02:12:09,673 --> 02:12:11,754
I知 happy.

1814
02:12:13,914 --> 02:12:16,434
Thank you for coming, Rizvan.

1815
02:12:16,513 --> 02:12:18,914
But you should not be here.
- I知 happy, I知 here.

1816
02:12:18,994 --> 02:12:20,995
No, you must go.

1817
02:12:21,075 --> 02:12:22,755
No, you must go.
- No, no, no.

1818
02:12:22,835 --> 02:12:25,235
Listen to me.
- No, no, no.

1819
02:12:25,314 --> 02:12:26,915
You should not be here.

1820
02:12:26,995 --> 02:12:30,755
This one you cannot repair. Now go.

1821
02:12:44,756 --> 02:12:46,436
Mama, Rizvan.

1822
02:12:50,196 --> 02:12:52,357
Oh, God the church is going to fall.

1823
02:12:52,436 --> 02:12:54,077
We're going to die.

1824
02:12:54,157 --> 02:12:56,237
The church is going to fall.

1825
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:48,080
Hadith says that the Almighty
does not judge by color or creed..

1826
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,520
..but by actions and deeds.

1827
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:50,960
lf that is the truth..

1828
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:52,560
..then Rizvan Khan by the
sheer force of his actions..

1829
02:13:52,639 --> 02:13:55,481
..has elevated the entire
humanity in the eyes of God.

1830
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:58,721
Just recently this
man was arrested..

1831
02:13:58,801 --> 02:14:02,161
..and tortured for being
an enemy combatant of this country.

1832
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:04,801
Wonder what the government
officials would call this..

1833
02:14:04,881 --> 02:14:06,921
..Muslim enemy combatant today?

1834
02:14:07,001 --> 02:14:10,282
As he selflessly tries to save
the remaining lives in Wilhemina.

1835
02:14:10,361 --> 02:14:12,682
Just a few days ago this
man was called a terrorist..

1836
02:14:12,762 --> 02:14:14,082
..and tortured mercilessly.

1837
02:14:14,162 --> 02:14:16,602
Today we wait for the response
of the government officials..

1838
02:14:16,681 --> 02:14:19,882
..as he tirelessly
strives to save innocent lives.

1839
02:14:19,962 --> 02:14:21,602
lf the authorities want
to find the true enemy..

1840
02:14:21,681 --> 02:14:23,602
..combatant of this country.

1841
02:14:23,681 --> 02:14:27,363
Then they would find it in the
grief and debris of Wilhemina.

1842
02:14:27,883 --> 02:14:30,563
It's a long journey
to change the world.

1843
02:14:30,642 --> 02:14:35,243
But the first few steps have been
taken by Rizvan Khan in Wilhemina.

1844
02:14:36,763 --> 02:14:40,083
Isn't it our duty now to
take this journey forward?

1845
02:14:40,203 --> 02:14:42,364
Raj Burman, Star News.

1846
02:14:52,164 --> 02:14:55,484
Please don't take my
baby away from me.

1847
02:14:55,764 --> 02:14:58,885
Please don't take my
baby away from me.

1848
02:15:00,324 --> 02:15:04,245
Mandira, people are suffering
here and are very helpless.

1849
02:15:04,885 --> 02:15:08,725
I wish I could take
all of them from here.

1850
02:15:08,965 --> 02:15:11,565
But I don't have the
physical strength to do that.

1851
02:15:13,926 --> 02:15:16,406
Mama Jenny is right..

1852
02:15:16,485 --> 02:15:19,886
This one.. this one I can't repair.

1853
02:15:22,966 --> 02:15:26,846
Now we can only await
the Lord's merciful eye.

1854
02:15:33,606 --> 02:15:39,447
Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama!

1855
02:16:33,890 --> 02:16:35,731
While several hurricane hit areas..

1856
02:16:35,810 --> 02:16:37,931
..have suffered from
government inaction.

1857
02:16:38,011 --> 02:16:41,851
One small town in Georgia is
slowly getting back on its feet.

1858
02:16:42,251 --> 02:16:45,091
This group has brought
something more valuable than money.

1859
02:16:45,171 --> 02:16:47,012
They brought themselves.

1860
02:16:47,092 --> 02:16:49,172
The US government may
have forgotten the flood..

1861
02:16:49,252 --> 02:16:50,932
..inflicted area of Wilhemina,
Georgia..

1862
02:16:51,012 --> 02:16:53,052
..but one man has
refused to be indifferent..

1863
02:16:53,131 --> 02:16:54,892
..to the plight of its inhabitants.

1864
02:16:54,971 --> 02:16:57,452
This one man has spared
no efforts in helping..

1865
02:16:57,532 --> 02:17:00,892
..rehabilitate the
population of Wilhemina.

1866
02:17:01,532 --> 02:17:03,693
Looking at him as an
inspiration today..

1867
02:17:03,773 --> 02:17:07,133
..many Americans have
rushed to Wilhemina..

1868
02:17:07,212 --> 02:17:10,653
..and its neighboring towns to help
in rebuilding the destroyed towns.

1869
02:17:10,732 --> 02:17:13,213
And all this just
because of one man..

1870
02:17:13,293 --> 02:17:15,293
..whose name is Rizvan Khan..

1871
02:17:15,373 --> 02:17:19,254
..and who, in his own words,
is not a 'terrorist'..

1872
02:17:29,493 --> 02:17:31,214
Following the example of Wilhemina..

1873
02:17:31,294 --> 02:17:33,574
..towns are being
adopted across the country.

1874
02:17:33,654 --> 02:17:35,655
And while our military
is tied up in Iraq..

1875
02:17:35,734 --> 02:17:37,455
..reconstruction of these towns..

1876
02:17:37,535 --> 02:17:40,375
..has been taken on
by ordinary Americans.

1877
02:17:40,455 --> 02:17:43,775
And today, as our
special guest from Wilhemina..

1878
02:17:43,855 --> 02:17:45,935
..we have the man, who
got the whole ball rolling.

1879
02:17:46,015 --> 02:17:47,615
Mr. Rizvan Khan.

1880
02:17:47,695 --> 02:17:51,536
Oh no, no, no it's Khan.
- Excuse me.

1881
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:53,296
Khan.
- Excuse me.

1882
02:17:53,376 --> 02:17:54,656
Khan.
- One minute.

1883
02:17:54,735 --> 02:17:56,776
From the epiglottis, ma'am. Khan.

1884
02:17:56,856 --> 02:17:58,936
I知 sorry, Rizvan.

1885
02:17:59,096 --> 02:18:02,096
Maybe you could tell us why
you want to meet the president?

1886
02:18:02,335 --> 02:18:05,297
Senator, you need to take a look
at these campaign accounts. - Later.

1887
02:18:05,377 --> 02:18:06,777
I want to watch this.

1888
02:18:07,416 --> 02:18:09,857
My beautiful wife, Mandira.

1889
02:18:10,377 --> 02:18:16,977
She.. she told me to go and
meet the President of America.

1890
02:18:17,377 --> 02:18:20,577
A long tiring journey,
Rizvan. What kept you going?

1891
02:18:20,656 --> 02:18:23,458
My son's soccer shoes.

1892
02:18:23,538 --> 02:18:28,858
My son Sam, and his best friend
Reese, they love playing soccer.

1893
02:18:36,539 --> 02:18:38,339
I知 sorry Mrs. Khan,
I didn't know what to do.

1894
02:18:38,418 --> 02:18:40,859
And I was scared.
And they threatened hurt me.

1895
02:18:40,939 --> 02:18:42,419
And I知 sorry.

1896
02:18:42,498 --> 02:18:45,019
I知 just really, really sorry.

1897
02:18:45,099 --> 02:18:50,299
I知 sorry Mrs..
- sorry is not good enough.

1898
02:18:52,058 --> 02:18:54,140
That's just not good enough.

1899
02:19:26,942 --> 02:19:29,622
Thank you for asking
for leniency for me.

1900
02:19:31,622 --> 02:19:34,582
I didn't do it for you,
I did it for your mom.

1901
02:19:35,462 --> 02:19:37,422
My mom won't forgive me.

1902
02:19:38,542 --> 02:19:41,223
She will. She's a mom.

1903
02:20:19,344 --> 02:20:22,185
Mandira, this is Sarah.

1904
02:20:22,265 --> 02:20:23,345
Thanks.

1905
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:25,665
Thank you for Reese.

1906
02:20:26,144 --> 02:20:30,666
And I hope and pray that
Sam's soul rests in peace.

1907
02:20:32,145 --> 02:20:35,706
Mandira, we both know what it
feels like to lose people we love.

1908
02:20:36,985 --> 02:20:39,306
I lost my husband to hate.

1909
02:20:40,065 --> 02:20:42,067
Don't lose Rizvan.

1910
02:20:42,146 --> 02:20:47,427
Let go of your anger, just let go.

1911
02:21:01,308 --> 02:21:02,748
I love you son.

1912
02:21:18,709 --> 02:21:20,589
Zakir, Hasina.

1913
02:21:20,748 --> 02:21:22,389
I知 leaving now.. Bye, bye.

1914
02:21:22,469 --> 02:21:25,229
Bhai (brother) why do you have to
leave so late at night?

1915
02:21:25,309 --> 02:21:26,829
I've to go now.

1916
02:21:26,908 --> 02:21:28,950
It is three days to the
Presidential election.

1917
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:30,230
After that the
President will change.

1918
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:31,830
I have to meet him before that.

1919
02:21:31,909 --> 02:21:34,790
Now, I need to meet him now.
Now, now.

1920
02:22:47,073 --> 02:22:48,795
Leave me!

1921
02:22:48,875 --> 02:22:51,915
You got Dr. Rehman arrested!

1922
02:22:52,074 --> 02:22:55,155
You are an infidel!
This is your punishment, Khan!

1923
02:22:55,234 --> 02:22:57,395
This is your punishment!
You have to die!

1924
02:22:57,475 --> 02:22:59,235
Islam will never forgive you!

1925
02:22:59,315 --> 02:23:00,795
Leave me!

1926
02:23:00,875 --> 02:23:04,116
Oh Lord!!

1927
02:23:04,196 --> 02:23:07,596
The United States of
America has a new President.

1928
02:23:07,675 --> 02:23:08,756
Doctor, he just got up.

1929
02:23:08,835 --> 02:23:10,756
Let me check all his vitals,
let's go.

1930
02:23:48,318 --> 02:23:51,319
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

1931
02:23:54,119 --> 02:23:57,079
He died because of you.
Because of your surname!

1932
02:23:58,799 --> 02:24:00,639
Leave me alone.

1933
02:24:00,838 --> 02:24:02,519
Go right now! This instant!

1934
02:24:02,598 --> 02:24:05,559
Go now, now.

1935
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:09,920
When should I come back, Mandira?

1936
02:24:50,402 --> 02:24:53,723
I.. I didn't die, Mandira.

1937
02:24:55,323 --> 02:24:58,683
No, you didn't.

1938
02:25:01,162 --> 02:25:04,603
Can I get a hug, please?

1939
02:25:04,842 --> 02:25:06,363
Please.

1940
02:25:14,204 --> 02:25:17,444
I love you.
- I know.

1941
02:25:17,923 --> 02:25:19,884
I love you too.

1942
02:25:29,524 --> 02:25:32,365
Today the President elect visits
flood inflicted Georgia State.

1943
02:25:32,444 --> 02:25:34,605
The question is
whether Rizvan Khan..

1944
02:25:34,684 --> 02:25:38,965
..who has just been discharged from
the hospital will get to meet him.

1945
02:25:39,045 --> 02:25:43,766
Khan has refused to go back home
until he meets the President elect.

1946
02:25:43,845 --> 02:25:46,006
Raj Burman.. Star News.

1947
02:25:46,966 --> 02:25:49,086
Khan.. let's go home. You
don't need to do this now.

1948
02:25:49,165 --> 02:25:50,366
No, no, no.

1949
02:25:50,445 --> 02:25:52,566
Why?
- No, no, no.

1950
02:25:52,646 --> 02:25:55,206
I have to meet the President.

1951
02:25:55,606 --> 02:26:00,807
Ammi (mother) had said, ''A Khan
always keeps his word!''

1952
02:26:02,766 --> 02:26:06,527
Folks, we'll make sure
we do everything we can..

1953
02:26:06,606 --> 02:26:09,047
..to bring Georgia back on its feet.

1954
02:26:10,366 --> 02:26:11,448
Thank you.

1955
02:26:12,447 --> 02:26:14,288
After winning the election..

1956
02:26:14,367 --> 02:26:17,288
..the President elect in
his first Presidential tour..

1957
02:26:17,367 --> 02:26:19,408
..has announced a
special relief package..

1958
02:26:19,488 --> 02:26:22,088
..for the flood
inflicted Georgia State.

1959
02:26:25,288 --> 02:26:26,568
After offering aid to
the state of Georgia..

1960
02:26:26,648 --> 02:26:28,489
The President will go to
New York from here to..

1961
02:26:28,569 --> 02:26:31,489
..participate in the
United Nations' special summit.

1962
02:26:36,129 --> 02:26:39,169
Back off please, clear the area.
Please clear the area.

1963
02:26:39,248 --> 02:26:41,089
The President has left. Please.

1964
02:26:41,168 --> 02:26:42,289
That's Rizvan Khan.

1965
02:26:42,368 --> 02:26:44,410
Please back.
- I want to see the President.

1966
02:26:44,490 --> 02:26:45,570
President's left please.

1967
02:26:45,650 --> 02:26:48,810
Rizvan Khan who has been in the news
for all his efforts in Wilhemina..

1968
02:26:48,890 --> 02:26:51,290
..is now at the Governor's mansion.

1969
02:26:52,449 --> 02:26:56,250
He has been trying to meet
the President for a while now.

1970
02:26:56,330 --> 02:27:00,611
It's sad that he won't
meet the President even today.

1971
02:27:00,690 --> 02:27:03,131
Rizvan Khan's supporters are
quite dejected at this prospect.

1972
02:27:03,211 --> 02:27:06,691
However it looks like he'll face
disappointment all over again.

1973
02:27:07,170 --> 02:27:09,291
A disappointed group
of Khan's supporters..

1974
02:27:09,370 --> 02:27:11,691
..are getting ready to turn back.

1975
02:27:13,411 --> 02:27:15,412
Copy that, Regal is on foot.

1976
02:27:16,451 --> 02:27:19,252
Repeat that please.
- Regal is on foot.

1977
02:27:46,253 --> 02:27:48,174
Are you Rizvan Khan?
- Yes, sir.

1978
02:27:48,253 --> 02:27:49,334
Yes.
- Yes, sir.

1979
02:27:49,414 --> 02:27:51,094
The President wants to meet you.

1980
02:28:23,935 --> 02:28:26,496
Greetings..

1981
02:28:27,015 --> 02:28:30,896
Rizvan Khan, good to
see you hale and hearty.

1982
02:28:31,296 --> 02:28:32,697
You're on TV more than me now.

1983
02:28:32,776 --> 02:28:34,617
Mandira. He knows my name.

1984
02:28:34,696 --> 02:28:37,377
You already know my name.
- Yes, I do.

1985
02:28:37,456 --> 02:28:39,017
Your name is Khan.
- Yes.

1986
02:28:39,096 --> 02:28:42,337
And you're not a terrorist.
- Oh no, no I知 not a terrorist. No.

1987
02:28:42,417 --> 02:28:46,377
And.. this is my son.

1988
02:28:48,137 --> 02:28:52,898
He.. he wasn't a terrorist either.
My son. - I know.

1989
02:28:52,978 --> 02:28:54,818
You know.

1990
02:28:55,738 --> 02:28:57,978
I知 so sorry for your loss.
- Okay.

1991
02:28:58,058 --> 02:28:59,658
Yeah, thank you.

1992
02:29:01,298 --> 02:29:02,698
He's sorry.

1993
02:29:04,538 --> 02:29:09,219
All of us share this world
before brief moment in time.

1994
02:29:09,499 --> 02:29:14,859
And I知 honoured to share
the time of Rizvan Khan.

1995
02:29:17,659 --> 02:29:19,940
Rizvan has reminded us..

1996
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:21,820
Sam..

1997
02:29:22,619 --> 02:29:27,060
Our Khan has managed to achieve,
with his love and humanity..

1998
02:29:27,379 --> 02:29:29,740
..what my hatred
could never achieve.

1999
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:32,500
My anger threw us apart..

2000
02:29:32,980 --> 02:29:36,621
..but today his love has
brought us together in a way..

2001
02:29:36,901 --> 02:29:40,061
..where we remember
you with renewed hope.

2002
02:29:48,860 --> 02:29:51,662
Now I will never let
him go anywhere, Sam.

2003
02:29:52,021 --> 02:29:55,022
I will keep this love with me..

2004
02:29:55,822 --> 02:30:01,022
For me.. For you.. Forever!

2005
02:30:03,982 --> 02:30:06,783
Anything else, Rizvan?
- Yes.

2006
02:30:06,862 --> 02:30:11,423
John Marshall, Homeland security,
San Francisco said to say, ''Howdy''.

2007
02:30:11,942 --> 02:30:13,663
Howdy?
- Howdy.

2008
02:30:14,223 --> 02:30:17,783
I tell you what, security has
any other messages, you call me.

2009
02:30:17,862 --> 02:30:20,143
Good, good can I
have your number please?

2010
02:30:20,702 --> 02:30:22,264
Thank you Mr. President.
- Thank you.

2011
02:30:22,344 --> 02:30:24,424
