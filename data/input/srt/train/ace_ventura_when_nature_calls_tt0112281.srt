1
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:01,407
Negative. No sign.

2
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,173
Wait a second. I think I got him.

3
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,272
You know...

4
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,109
...you could put somebody's eye out
with that thing.

5
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,777
We airlifted out the last passengers,
Ace. We're heading out.

6
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,045
What about the animal cargo?!

7
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:21,214
Don't worry. It's just one little
raccoon. If I were you, I'd turn back.

8
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,057
If you were me, then I'd be you!

9
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:27,288
And I'd use your body to get to the top!

10
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:30,395
You can't stop me,
no matter who you are!

11
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,233
Loser!

12
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,067
L-o-o...

13
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,507
...s-e-r.

14
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,821
Hungry, fells?

15
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,038
That should hold you for a while.

16
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,142
That's okay, Spike.

17
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:00,082
There's nothing more we can do.

18
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:04,090
Look, Spike!

19
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,250
Do not fret, my woodland friend.

20
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,823
Your life is in the hands
of Ace Ventura...

21
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,625
...Pet Detective.

22
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,365
Whatever you do...

23
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,435
...don't look down.

24
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,072
Hang on!

25
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:33,580
Hang on, little buddy!

26
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:35,411
I got you!

27
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,243
I think I got you!

28
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:38,582
Maybe not.

29
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,081
You're slipping!

30
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:42,684
Don't let go!

31
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,251
My goodness.

32
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:06,268
Hello.

33
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,271
That was quite a shock.

34
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,070
It's extremely nice to meet you.

35
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,576
My name is Fulton Greenwall...

36
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:17,514
...and I am looking for an Ace Ventura.

37
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:19,782
No man here...

38
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,686
...carries with him...

39
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,916
...a label.

40
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,185
What?

41
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,192
Oh, yes.

42
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,193
No names. How silly of me.

43
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,460
He's an American.

44
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,091
We are all children...

45
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,702
...of the same life force.

46
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,201
Yes, of course we are.

47
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,371
He bends over and speaks from his rear.

48
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,705
Oh, him.

49
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,311
Right this way.

50
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:50,945
He came to us a broken man.

51
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,453
He had lost the will
to sustain his existence.

52
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,716
Yes, I heard about that unfortunate
accident with the raccoon.

53
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:59,818
It was terrible for him.

54
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:01,827
But the life force...

55
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,261
...once again...

56
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:04,959
...smiled upon him.

57
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:06,192
He's now...

58
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:07,825
...at peace.

59
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:24,811
I will wait here.

60
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,678
I must apologize.

61
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:52,207
Quite. Well, no harm done.

62
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:53,871
Let me introduce myself.

63
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:57,414
My name is Fulton Greenwall,
and I'm here to employ your services...

64
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,511
...in the retrieval of a lost animal.

65
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,020
Can you help us?

66
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,285
Your request is like your intestine.

67
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:05,589
Stinky...

68
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,352
...and dangerous.

69
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,293
We can pay handsomely.

70
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,466
I am now a child of light.

71
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:14,567
Your earthly money
holds no appeal to me.

72
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:17,201
Twenty thousand dollars.

73
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:22,969
Really?

74
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:27,477
No.

75
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,145
I cannot.

76
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,084
For I am sorely needed...

77
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:34,719
...here...

78
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,953
...at the ashram.

79
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:39,891
May I interject?

80
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:41,888
We're short of space.

81
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:45,428
And it's important for you
to use your talents.

82
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,735
Let me help you pack.

83
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:53,671
But I have yet to attain
omnipresent super-galactic oneness.

84
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,368
Wait!

85
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:58,409
There it is!

86
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,879
You've just attained it.

87
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,548
I have?

88
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,178
Just now.

89
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,083
You are one!

90
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,355
I can see it in your eyes.

91
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:12,959
You're more one than anyone.

92
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,596
What about my medallion
of spiritual accomplishment?

93
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:16,689
Take mine.

94
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,831
This took you 80 years to achieve!

95
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,868
That's okay.

96
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,428
I don't like it anymore. Really.

97
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,709
In light of this personal sacrifice
you've made...

98
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:34,773
...I have no choice...

99
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,048
...but to take the case.

100
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:39,518
Great!

101
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,287
I'll tell the others.

102
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,880
Master!

103
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,795
Break it to them gently.

104
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,622
I've never seen them
act like that before.

105
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:19,419
Denial can be an ugly thing.

106
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,456
We should go, Mr. Ventura.
I've arranged a plane.

107
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,766
I'll meet you at the bottom.

108
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:29,103
There's still one more thing
I must do before I go.

109
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,342
Isn't this incredible?

110
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,783
It's going to be some kind of record!

111
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:46,084
"Everyone loves a Slinky

112
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:48,282
"You got to get a Slinky."

113
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:51,523
Go, Slinky, go!

114
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:57,359
Oh, man!

115
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,091
Can you believe it?

116
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,029
It was right there!

117
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,432
Can I do it one more time?

118
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:09,376
Forgive me, but if we don't hurry,
we might miss the plane.

119
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,211
Of course.

120
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,382
How selfish of me.

121
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:16,952
Let's do all the things
that you want to do.

122
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,477
Canadian moose during mating season.

123
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,908
And now...

124
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,917
...a yak.

125
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,253
Peanut?

126
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,892
Yes, I have one right here!

127
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,730
It's bulky,
but I consider it a carry-on.

128
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,195
Peanuts?

129
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,200
Oh, I see!

130
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,437
If we can get back to business,
Mr. Ventura?

131
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:16,305
The Wachati are a peaceful tribe.

132
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,505
Since their sacred animal
has vanished...

133
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:23,715
...they believe that there is a curse
fallen on their village.

134
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,615
It all started some time ago when,
one night...

135
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,090
So, the daughter of the Wachati chief...

136
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,891
...is set to wed the first son of
the Wachootoo tribe.

137
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,633
And the sacred animal was offered
as dowry for the marriage.

138
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,702
But...

139
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,427
...if it is not recovered...

140
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:44,234
...the result will be...

141
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,466
...the merciless slaughter of
the Wachatis.

142
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,476
Mr. Ventura?

143
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:57,649
There's...

144
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,082
...someone on the wing.

145
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:00,382
Some...

146
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:01,922
...thing!

147
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:07,662
I'm sorry, what did you say?

148
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:11,098
The daughter of the Wachati chief...

149
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,529
...is set to wed...

150
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,434
...the first son of the Wachootoo tribe.

151
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,621
Spectacular!

152
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,188
This land holds great beauty!

153
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,879
How far to the crime scene?

154
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,473
I've been instructed
to bring you first to the consulate...

155
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,416
...which is beyond the trees...

156
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:08,211
...on the other side of the jungle.
So, you'll have to circle around...

157
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:16,660
Steering's a bit loose!

158
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:20,893
Alignment's off!

159
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,347
"Oh, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

160
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:34,746
"We love you

161
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,911
"And our pretty Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang loves us, too

162
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,586
"On Chitty Chitty Bang Bang we depend

163
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,916
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
our fine four-fendered friend."

164
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,276
There's the consulate!

165
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,074
Oh, thank God!

166
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,617
If I can just find a parking spot...

167
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:12,716
Perhaps we should slow down
just a teensy bit.

168
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:14,789
Nonsense, poppy pants!

169
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:16,947
We're going a bit fast!

170
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,118
Really!

171
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,558
Look out!

172
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:35,637
Like a glove!

173
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:45,248
You should get this baby detailed.

174
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,082
The Consul General's car!

175
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:50,989
Down!

176
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,651
That's it. Down.

177
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,934
Come on, man!

178
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:26,290
Mr. Ventura, so looking forward
to your arrival.

179
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:35,359
Funny, it didn't seem that painful
when you were doing it to the horse.

180
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:36,934
Sir...

181
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:40,463
...Mr. Ventura has
an affinity for animals.

182
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,372
Shall we?

183
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,377
Shalln't we?

184
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:50,209
Tell me, Mr. Ventura...

185
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,487
...just how good are you?

186
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:55,385
You're an extreme workaholic.

187
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:58,585
You recently returned from a trip
to Gotan, in Northern Africa...

188
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,652
...and you just took a nasty spill
because of some...

189
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:05,223
...shoddy masonry work.

190
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,497
Very impressive.

191
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,662
May I ask how?

192
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,237
Surely.

193
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:17,443
The abrasion on your hand is the type
sustained in a three-to-five foot fall.

194
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:20,913
The remnants of plaster on your shoe
pointed to a careless mason.

195
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,348
Your new watch, a quality
forgery of Cartier, was...

196
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:28,014
...most likely purchased through
the North African black market!

197
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:31,025
And my work habits?

198
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,017
A workaholic.

199
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,594
The urine stain on your pants...

200
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,096
...would signify that
you're a single-shaker!

201
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,361
Far too busy for the follow-up jiggle.

202
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:40,763
Brilliant, Mr. Ventura!

203
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:41,934
Simply brilliant!

204
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:43,062
Spank you!

205
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,930
Spank you very much!

206
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:52,276
We've been coexisting quite nicely
with the native cultures...

207
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:56,579
...for the past 200 years. They're
almost like family at this point.

208
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:57,344
Are they?

209
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,513
It is imperative that we recover
the sacred animal.

210
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:04,286
If not, the peaceable
Wachatis will be obliterated.

211
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,856
The Wachootoos are bloodthirsty.

212
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:11,031
They consider its disappearance
both an insult and a curse.

213
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:20,038
Do I have something in my teeth?

214
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:22,703
Cadby!

215
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,038
Lovely brunch, I must say.

216
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:27,011
Quinn!

217
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:29,879
I'd like you to meet Ace Ventura.

218
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:34,583
This is Burton Quinn. He owns
and operates Quinn land Safari Park.

219
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,049
Most call me Quinn.

220
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:38,951
Say hello, Tinky.

221
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:40,784
Pleasure, Tinky.

222
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:44,126
Corvus corax. Common raven.
Smartest of all birds.

223
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,460
Rare in these parts.

224
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:52,568
Excuse me.

225
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,714
That's quite a wrap you're wearing.

226
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:03,340
Perhaps I could get you
some fluffy new slippers...

227
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:06,615
...made from the heads of
innocent and defenceless baby seals!

228
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:10,082
Who is this ghastly man?

229
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,591
Ace Ventura, pet detective.

230
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:14,184
You must be...

231
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,627
...the Monopoly Guy!

232
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:21,262
Thanks for the free parking.

233
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:24,671
Another activist, Maguire.

234
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,101
Activist, yes.

235
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,271
Activist, yes.

236
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,773
Mr. Ventura...

237
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:39,517
...there's nothing wrong with
enjoying the fruits of nature.

238
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,851
You should try it some time.

239
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,851
All right, then.

240
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,527
You know something?

241
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,188
You're right.

242
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:26,561
"Do not pass go.
Do not collect two hundred dollars."

243
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:33,238
It's lovely, but I fancy myself
an autumn.

244
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,979
If you've quite finished, Mr. Ventura...

245
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,082
...we might make for
the projection room.

246
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:45,610
Kookie.

247
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:51,623
I'd like you to meet Hitu, chief
of tribal security in the province.

248
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,190
Please!

249
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:55,354
Don't...

250
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,190
...get up.

251
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,964
At this point,
we don't have any leads...

252
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:08,871
...but we've had similar
problems in the past.

253
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,109
Sorry.

254
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:22,955
This is Derrick McCane...

255
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:27,894
...spotted several times in the province
in the past year. He makes a living...

256
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,790
...from rare and endangered species.

257
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:35,894
These two are Australians.

258
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,096
The bald one is Mick Katie.

259
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:41,565
The other is said to have
been raised by abori...

260
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,075
...aborigines.

261
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:48,580
The natives call him...

262
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:52,145
Call him Gahjii...

263
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,653
...the hunter.

264
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:59,486
Both are known poachers
and have been seen in the area!

265
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:05,227
This wedding's in four days.
I cannot have bloodshed here!

266
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:07,425
We're counting on you!

267
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,040
Hi-ho, Silver!

268
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,671
Away!

269
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:24,284
I've assigned Greenwall to assist you.

270
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:28,015
Before you go, Mr. Ventura...

271
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,682
...I'd like to show you
something you may enjoy.

272
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,522
As one animal lover to another.

273
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:55,376
Something wrong, Mr. Ventura?

274
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:01,348
Of course not.

275
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,555
There is a lovely room of death.

276
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:05,725
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

277
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,998
Down, Boba!

278
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,332
Mr. Ventura, how could you?!

279
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,093
Now, Mr. Ventura, I think
the village is about a mile ahead.

280
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:47,428
Excellent.

281
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:48,862
Flat tire!

282
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:54,431
I think this joke has run
its course, don't you?

283
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:55,967
Certainly.

284
00:24:56,144 --> 00:24:58,874
I prostrate myself before you
and beg forgiveness.

285
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:01,539
Don't get me wrong.
I do enjoy the occasional prank.

286
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:04,449
It's just that my heel
is getting rather raw.

287
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:10,949
We love you, dark continent!
Good night!

288
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:15,051
Listen!

289
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,394
The majestic song of
the male silverback gorilla.

290
00:25:21,803 --> 00:25:26,740
We should move along. It's their mating
season and they can get rather hostile.

291
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,056
Excuse me, Mr. Ventura.

292
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:44,681
I have to rest.

293
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,587
Of course you do!

294
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:50,823
The Wachatis believe they draw
their power from these caves.

295
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:55,095
Now they live in fear since
their sacred bat has vanished.

296
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:57,430
Bat?!

297
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:01,667
What...

298
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:02,673
...bat?

299
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:05,206
The one we're here to find,
Mr. Ventura.

300
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:08,814
You didn't say anything about a bat.

301
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,982
What's the difference?

302
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:11,848
What's the difference?

303
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,454
Have you seen one? They're hideous.

304
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:19,526
Lifeless, beady eyes, clawed feet,
huge grotesque wings. Even fangs.

305
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,194
They give you rabies.

306
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:28,631
Yes, quite. I see your point.

307
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:31,797
But are you saying
that you won't take the case?

308
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,030
No.

309
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:37,874
As a being of light, I must show
compassion for all living things.

310
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:38,968
Good.

311
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:40,975
I'm not touching it, though!

312
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:43,041
No, spank you.

313
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:59,564
The Wachati are a peaceful people.

314
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:02,225
They find all forms of life sacred.

315
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:04,200
I like them already.

316
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:06,231
Bumbawae Atuna.

317
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:09,168
Nice to see you.

318
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:10,571
Bumblebee Tuna.

319
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:12,402
Bumblebee Tuna.

320
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:14,975
Ace Ventura, pet detective.

321
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:16,511
How are you?

322
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:18,685
All right, then.

323
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,190
Excuse me.

324
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:25,190
Your balls are showing.

325
00:27:25,493 --> 00:27:27,017
Bumblebee Tuna.

326
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:31,588
They have lived in the same state
for thousands of years.

327
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:35,361
They did not know about disease
until the white man came.

328
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:41,875
What's going on over here?

329
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:46,044
All young Wachati warriors
must face five days...

330
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:47,681
...of balance and concentration.

331
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,274
Should he lose his focus and fall...

332
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:52,613
...he must start over again.

333
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:55,378
Earthquake test!

334
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:00,722
He's good.

335
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:03,962
With my help, he could be the best.

336
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:06,166
We should see the chief,
Mr. Ventura.

337
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:07,997
This way.

338
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:09,636
Neato!

339
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:26,980
The chief says he knew you would come.

340
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:35,085
Chim-chiminy chim-chim-cheroo!

341
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:42,434
The chief has not understood
the dialect you're using.

342
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,832
Say I'm happy to meet him.

343
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:45,839
And that his sacred...

344
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:48,302
...bat...

345
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,171
...is as good as found.

346
00:29:00,355 --> 00:29:03,688
My goodness. The chief
really seems to like you.

347
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:07,194
That is a great sign of affection
in the Wachati tribe.

348
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:12,695
Really?

349
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:15,694
This is the chief's son, Ouda.

350
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:18,602
The missionaries came through
and taught him English.

351
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,364
I like you!

352
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:26,875
My...

353
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:30,376
Aren't I the popular one?

354
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:36,723
Allow me to display my affection.

355
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:07,677
It is the mucus...

356
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:09,687
...that binds us.

357
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:15,859
The chief says that
the sacred hut is over there.

358
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:24,895
How'd they pass the guard?

359
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:27,736
I'm afraid he was found shortly after...

360
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,543
...sleeping.

361
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:32,775
At ease, soldier.

362
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:35,040
We all make mistakes.

363
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:50,391
Quite an auspicious dwelling
for a filthy, flying weasel.

364
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,128
Please, Mr. Ventura!

365
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:58,433
That is sacred ground. I'm sorry,
but only the Wachati are allowed there.

366
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,166
Take it easy.

367
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:03,469
I'm the lougie guy, remember?

368
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,756
Yes, yes, Chief. Thank you.

369
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:20,589
Thank you.

370
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:23,959
The chief says that unless
the sacred bat is returned...

371
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:29,001
...before the marriage of the princess,
the Wachati tribe will meet their death.

372
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:31,462
What type of bat are we talking about?

373
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:34,433
The great white bat, of course.

374
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:45,682
Crepuscular Chiroptera?

375
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:47,844
But to the natives:

376
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,183
Shikaka.

377
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:05,095
Chickasha!

378
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:08,542
Shish kebab.

379
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:10,533
"Shaw shank Redemption."

380
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:12,144
Chicago!

381
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,375
You're out of there!

382
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,880
Go on. You're gone. Go on!

383
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:42,841
Were you going to eat these?

384
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,752
I've got to inspect that cage.

385
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,427
My, my, my.

386
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:09,200
This fruit paste is delicious!

387
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,036
The pottery is lovely!

388
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:12,638
It's made from guano.

389
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:14,173
Guano?

390
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:15,775
That sounds so familiar.

391
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,874
Bat droppings.

392
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:26,211
It's a chief resource of the Wachati.
They use it to make many things.

393
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,221
Yummy!

394
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:56,883
Now this is really fascinating.
This is a great Wachati tradition.

395
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:59,475
The virgin's dance of seduction.

396
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,589
I am now a holy man.

397
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:09,423
I think of women only
as mothers of our children.

398
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,360
They are a sanctuary for
the reproductive organs.

399
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,766
A temple to house
the miracle of procreation.

400
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,428
Do you have $1?

401
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:25,342
Thank you so much!

402
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,778
I've not danced in years!

403
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:48,634
Hi.

404
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:51,636
Don't mind me.

405
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:53,463
Sleep.

406
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,702
Sleep!

407
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:05,548
Fe... Fi!

408
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:08,480
Fo... fum!

409
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,658
I smell the fingerprints of scum!

410
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,163
Better dust the place.

411
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,612
Totally clean.

412
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,414
Not one damn clue.

413
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:44,848
Unless...

414
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:28,126
Here she comes. Oh, boy.

415
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,464
Holy, holy, holy, holy.

416
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:33,335
Good thoughts in, bad thoughts out.

417
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:35,466
You have come to help us.

418
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:37,271
We are in...

419
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:39,646
...great appreciation.

420
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:41,076
You...

421
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,639
...speak English.

422
00:36:43,818 --> 00:36:45,149
Yes!

423
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:47,917
The missionaries came with books.

424
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,761
You are very good with that!

425
00:36:57,932 --> 00:36:59,923
It's incredibly accurate.

426
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,268
Care to try?

427
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,441
Not bad!

428
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,038
Try again. Relax your shoulders.

429
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,472
Breathe.

430
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:15,344
And release.

431
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:20,016
There you go!

432
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,789
You make me smile.

433
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:26,117
And yet...

434
00:37:27,194 --> 00:37:29,025
...I am troubled.

435
00:37:30,364 --> 00:37:31,854
You see...

436
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:35,126
...the man my father
wants me to marry...

437
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:38,636
...I am worried I will not please him.

438
00:37:44,578 --> 00:37:46,876
I've never known a man.

439
00:37:56,824 --> 00:37:58,155
I'd love to help.

440
00:37:58,259 --> 00:37:59,658
But you see...

441
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:03,556
...I have vowed
to take a life of celibacy.

442
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,496
Well...

443
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:07,895
Perhaps this...

444
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:10,668
...will assist your decision.

445
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:17,404
Those are very nice.

446
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:20,046
But I am a child of light.
A pure spirit.

447
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,407
I'm no longer encumbered
by sexual appetites.

448
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:29,846
Oh, mama, oh, mama...

449
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:32,748
...oh, mama, oh, mama...

450
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:39,264
I'm so sorry Mr. Ventura...

451
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,601
That's okay.

452
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:49,939
I was just...

453
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:53,439
...practicing my mantra.

454
00:38:58,152 --> 00:38:59,744
I thought you wanted
to visit the sacred caves?

455
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,946
I do!

456
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:02,879
Meet me outside in 10 minutes.

457
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,725
If I don't finish my meditation...

458
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:08,555
...I tend to get a little cranky.

459
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,963
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

460
00:39:19,974 --> 00:39:22,966
Everything here seems good!
Big load off my mind!

461
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:27,136
You can speculate all you want,
but unless you check it out yourself...

462
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:28,408
...you never know.

463
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:29,412
Let's go back.

464
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:31,451
Don't you think you should investigate?

465
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:34,248
There's no reason to go in there. Ever.

466
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,219
I sense it as a holy man.

467
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:38,655
- You said you wanted...
- It's dark!

468
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:41,487
I could fall into a precipice.

469
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:42,758
Take this.

470
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:47,763
Spank you, Helpy Helperton.

471
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:10,954
I am not afraid!

472
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:16,127
I am not afraid.

473
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:23,464
I really like it here.

474
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:43,045
My medallion!

475
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,659
I will fear no living creature...

476
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:53,828
...as long as I keep this near me.

477
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:58,335
Take that, you winged spawn of Satan!

478
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:06,177
That's okay.

479
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,180
All I really need is my torch.

480
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,846
Die, devil bird!

481
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:19,521
I'm okay.

482
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:28,666
They're in my hair!

483
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,861
They're in my hair!

484
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,936
God in heaven! Help me!

485
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,042
There is nothing in your hair.

486
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:41,941
Exactly.

487
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:45,044
I was merely running a drill.

488
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,718
Just as I suspected.

489
00:41:52,893 --> 00:41:53,791
Quinn.

490
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,054
What?

491
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:57,394
We met him at Cadby's soiree.

492
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:00,500
His bird is a raven, Tinky.
I found that inside the cave.

493
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:04,231
You don't understand.
Burton Quinn is a powerful man.

494
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,895
Worry not.

495
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:08,904
For I...

496
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:11,067
...am a master...

497
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:13,074
...of disguises.

498
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:08,692
Eat up, guys!

499
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:11,303
None of this animal goes to waste.

500
00:43:45,072 --> 00:43:46,004
Mr. McCane.

501
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,529
How're you?

502
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:49,504
I'm doing well.

503
00:43:57,518 --> 00:43:59,850
Don't mind me, Mr. Quinn.

504
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:03,414
I'm just a curious little rhino.

505
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:05,583
I appreciate your...

506
00:44:06,093 --> 00:44:08,084
...agreeing to undertake this.

507
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:20,033
Meeting secretly
with sinister types much?

508
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,701
Ah, not too much. Ah, much too much.

509
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:47,894
Kind of hot in these rhinos.

510
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:01,637
Warm!

511
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:12,250
I had a dog and his name was...

512
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,093
...Bingo!

513
00:45:17,264 --> 00:45:18,925
Time to get some oxygen.

514
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,503
Come on!

515
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:39,616
Mayday!

516
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,688
Must...

517
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:49,292
...have...

518
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,020
...air!

519
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:14,885
Come on!

520
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:19,658
Quiet, quiet, quiet. Look, look.

521
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:25,225
Oh, look!

522
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,393
The mother rhino is giving birth!

523
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, God.

524
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:55,523
Mommy!

525
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:07,539
Cool!

526
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:09,139
We have to get out of here!

527
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:10,870
Quick, get in the jeep.

528
00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:12,773
Quick, girls, get in!

529
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,773
Welcome to Quinn land.

530
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,519
And you, too, my friend?

531
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:26,788
I know, you'll be happy here.

532
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,297
How did you get out, fells?

533
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,798
You're a cute little devil.

534
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:44,637
What you got?

535
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:04,561
Where's the bat?

536
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:07,063
What's this about?

537
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,559
Who are you?

538
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:10,427
Where...

539
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:12,133
...is...

540
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,099
...the bat?

541
00:48:14,408 --> 00:48:16,069
I know who you are.

542
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,603
I met you at Cadby's!

543
00:48:18,845 --> 00:48:19,937
You're that...

544
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,580
...Ventura fells!

545
00:48:21,782 --> 00:48:23,682
Last chance!

546
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:27,918
Where is that darn bat?

547
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:30,757
What're you going to do?

548
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:32,488
What're you going to do?

549
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:35,694
Whatever I have to get some answers.

550
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,198
Stop!

551
00:48:45,272 --> 00:48:46,534
Stop it!

552
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,369
You'd like me to stop it.

553
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:51,203
Getting to you?

554
00:48:52,245 --> 00:48:54,110
I won't tell you anything.

555
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,781
A tough guy, huh?

556
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:08,554
I know what to do with tough guys.

557
00:49:19,973 --> 00:49:21,964
My brother used to do that!

558
00:49:22,075 --> 00:49:23,804
You sadistic bastard!

559
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,275
Stop it!

560
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:27,074
All right! I'll talk!

561
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:27,909
Spill it!

562
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:31,644
I paid Derrick McCane to find the bat.

563
00:49:35,022 --> 00:49:37,582
I thought it could be an attraction.

564
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,923
Business has been a bit off lately.

565
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:41,760
So...

566
00:49:42,963 --> 00:49:45,261
...you don't know who...

567
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:48,160
...took the bat?

568
00:49:48,268 --> 00:49:49,997
Neither does McCane.

569
00:49:56,977 --> 00:49:59,104
I'm going to untie you now.

570
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,614
Before I do, I want you
to know that I'm really...

571
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:04,077
...truly...

572
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:05,181
...very...

573
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:07,276
...sorry!

574
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:13,919
Appreciate the lift!

575
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:16,192
We'll walk from here.

576
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:24,369
Quinn is out of the picture.
We have no more suspects or clues.

577
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,962
But I have instincts.

578
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:29,041
And my instincts tell me
we're getting closer.

579
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,641
I can feel it.

580
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,708
I can feel it like it's right...

581
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,543
...in my neck!

582
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:37,216
Run!

583
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,721
Starting to get numb!

584
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,230
Three darts...

585
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:56,802
...is too much!

586
00:51:28,468 --> 00:51:29,457
I think...

587
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:31,935
...I lost them!

588
00:52:02,335 --> 00:52:03,495
Flowers...

589
00:52:03,904 --> 00:52:05,496
...for me?

590
00:52:06,273 --> 00:52:09,265
I do declare, Mr. Beauregard.

591
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:13,341
You are my hero.

592
00:52:19,853 --> 00:52:21,445
Was I...

593
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,454
...talking in my sleep?

594
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,888
You've been suffering hysteria.
It's a natural reaction to the poison.

595
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:29,359
Water.

596
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,804
Guano bowls.

597
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,171
Collect the whole set.

598
00:52:41,374 --> 00:52:43,934
Ace, did you see the shooter?

599
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,374
Only their feet.

600
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:47,543
Not enough for a positive ID.

601
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,973
It's the dart of a Wachootoo shaman.

602
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:52,141
The what what an?

603
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,551
The Wachootoo shaman, or medicine man,
protests the intertribal wedding.

604
00:53:00,627 --> 00:53:02,060
Does he?

605
00:53:04,231 --> 00:53:06,096
You do not speak Wachootoo.

606
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:08,167
I go with you.

607
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:11,163
Ouda will be my interpreter.

608
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,733
Please, take care.

609
00:53:14,908 --> 00:53:19,242
The Wachootoo are savages.
If they catch you, they'll be merciless.

610
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,579
Worry not.

611
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,683
I will be as a fly on the wall,
a grain of salt in the ocean.

612
00:53:26,186 --> 00:53:29,587
I will slip amongst them
like a transparent...

613
00:53:31,758 --> 00:53:33,089
...thing.

614
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:01,119
The sacred bat must be in a hut.

615
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:04,221
We'll never know until
I can walk freely among them.

616
00:54:08,261 --> 00:54:10,024
Wunderbar!

617
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,564
He exclaimed with great relish.

618
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:39,782
Come on, girls, show them what you got.

619
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,070
I'm sure it's fine.

620
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,702
Ouda is probably going
for help right now.

621
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,605
Hello, Ace!

622
00:55:03,183 --> 00:55:04,172
They found me!

623
00:55:04,317 --> 00:55:05,944
No sweat!

624
00:55:08,355 --> 00:55:10,516
Don't beat yourself up.

625
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:20,455
You know...

626
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:24,694
...gingivitis is the number one
cause of all tooth decay.

627
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,009
What does "equinsu ocha" mean?

628
00:55:31,277 --> 00:55:32,801
White devil.

629
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:34,335
Tell him I'm not.

630
00:55:34,514 --> 00:55:37,312
I only met you. How do I know?

631
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,785
- He said...
- Let me guess. "White devil"?

632
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,448
You speak Wachootoo?

633
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:48,650
Tell them what I'm saying:

634
00:55:49,996 --> 00:55:52,556
I come in peace!

635
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:02,373
I couldn't help but notice
the "equinsu ocha" part.

636
00:56:02,709 --> 00:56:04,438
Did you refer to me as "White Devil"?

637
00:56:04,744 --> 00:56:06,075
That's how they know you.

638
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,577
Leave that part out from now on.

639
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:11,746
I represent the princess!

640
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:22,884
War...

641
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:24,753
...is hell.

642
00:56:25,098 --> 00:56:27,430
The last thing we want...

643
00:56:28,835 --> 00:56:30,427
...is a fight.

644
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:46,309
The chief said...

645
00:56:46,553 --> 00:56:48,680
...if you pass all Wachootoo tests...

646
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:50,784
...you do not die.

647
00:56:54,294 --> 00:56:55,852
Kookie.

648
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:29,878
My entrance to the winner's circle!

649
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:34,121
Your admiration is well-founded,
but I'm merely a servant.

650
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:36,660
Do not worship me!

651
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,833
Chief says you have passed
all tests but one.

652
00:58:50,343 --> 00:58:53,369
Only left is Wachootoo Circle of Death.

653
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,108
Funny...

654
00:58:55,348 --> 00:58:57,441
...that's my specialty.

655
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,086
This is it?

656
00:59:35,188 --> 00:59:37,315
I have to beat him?

657
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,170
All right, then!

658
00:59:54,607 --> 00:59:56,268
I must tell you...

659
00:59:58,544 --> 01:00:00,011
...I don't wish to fight.

660
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:04,208
Violence is no longer in my nature...

661
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:07,510
...but if you want it,
you got it, sister.

662
01:00:13,226 --> 01:00:15,057
Biting, I see.

663
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:18,026
I was unaware that the Wachootoo...

664
01:00:19,065 --> 01:00:21,033
...were biters!

665
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,136
Why don't you try this on
and see how it fits?

666
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,872
He much better fighter than you.

667
01:00:34,113 --> 01:00:35,637
Doi!

668
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,888
All right!

669
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,898
This White Devil thing
has gone far enough.

670
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:58,464
Nobody...

671
01:00:58,705 --> 01:01:00,229
...messes...

672
01:01:00,473 --> 01:01:02,498
...with the "do"!

673
01:01:20,393 --> 01:01:22,691
He said, "Sorry, White Devil..."

674
01:01:22,895 --> 01:01:24,590
...but he must kill you.

675
01:01:26,332 --> 01:01:28,766
I'll have you know
I have the reflexes of a cat.

676
01:01:28,835 --> 01:01:31,269
And the speed of a mongoose.

677
01:01:31,704 --> 01:01:32,932
Throw it!

678
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,869
I dare you!

679
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:55,053
Ouda, don't just stand there.
Throw me a spear!

680
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:25,819
It's in the bone! It's in the bone!

681
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:28,483
It's in the bone!

682
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,142
He says you make him laugh.

683
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:50,848
You are like sissy girl!

684
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:10,460
Wachootoo Chief say,
"You friend to Wachootoo."

685
01:03:17,777 --> 01:03:22,043
But if the curse of Shikaka not lifted
by tomorrow's sun at top of sky...

686
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:26,481
...Wachootoo kill all Wachati
and smash your head on a rock.

687
01:03:29,155 --> 01:03:30,349
Super.

688
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,114
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

689
01:03:32,692 --> 01:03:35,217
Take care. Super. Bye-bye, then.

690
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,288
Are your legs sore?

691
01:03:38,464 --> 01:03:40,329
Want me to carry you?

692
01:03:40,533 --> 01:03:42,398
That won't be necessary.

693
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:44,129
I have a high pain threshold.

694
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:46,168
Holy monkey!

695
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:13,255
Ace, why you stopped?

696
01:04:15,134 --> 01:04:17,694
The Wachootoo didn't take Shikaka.

697
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,537
Hi, welcome back.

698
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:24,573
What would you say this is?

699
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:26,435
Dart of Wachootoo shaman.

700
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,080
Precisely.

701
01:04:28,314 --> 01:04:31,215
And when compared to one of the darts
that hit me before?

702
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,212
Same.

703
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:35,218
Only to the untrained eye.

704
01:04:36,055 --> 01:04:38,990
The Wachootoo dart is made of
wood from a mimosa tree...

705
01:04:39,325 --> 01:04:43,785
...while the other is carved from
a red fungus-bearing acalla.

706
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,796
And there's only one area
of the jungle with red...

707
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,797
...fungus-bearing a callas.

708
01:04:50,169 --> 01:04:51,466
Go back to the village.

709
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:54,472
Tell them the Wachootoo's attack
is tomorrow at noon.

710
01:04:57,843 --> 01:05:01,404
This little hound dog
just picked up a scent.

711
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,589
Won't be long now, Katie.

712
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:19,330
Big night tonight.

713
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:21,593
You're going to meet your new owner.

714
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:23,163
G'day.

715
01:05:23,436 --> 01:05:25,165
Disgusting rat!

716
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:43,350
Gravy!

717
01:05:48,628 --> 01:05:50,357
Did you hear that?

718
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,296
What is it?

719
01:05:52,598 --> 01:05:54,088
Silverback.

720
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:06,934
Female.

721
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:08,936
Big.

722
01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:12,046
About 200 meters...

723
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,944
...south.

724
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:18,114
We'd get $5,000 for one of those.

725
01:06:18,357 --> 01:06:20,882
- What about the rat?
- Don't worry about it.

726
01:06:21,127 --> 01:06:22,958
We'll be back in no time.

727
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:29,965
Stay downwind of it.

728
01:06:45,484 --> 01:06:47,748
You're even uglier than I thought.

729
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,753
She's a big one, isn't she?

730
01:07:09,975 --> 01:07:11,340
Oh, boy.

731
01:07:11,544 --> 01:07:13,444
Deciduous trees on the bank.

732
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,172
Suman shrubs with extreme protococcus.

733
01:07:16,348 --> 01:07:18,339
Steadily increasing water current.

734
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,611
Spike...

735
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:23,949
...I think we could assume
the stream gets pretty rough up ahead.

736
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,965
As soon as I get you lose,
you can chew through my ropes.

737
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:44,533
That's it!

738
01:07:44,744 --> 01:07:45,642
That's it!

739
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,807
Yes. Your turn.

740
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:53,210
All right!

741
01:08:36,896 --> 01:08:38,591
I'm alive!

742
01:08:41,433 --> 01:08:43,594
I'm alive!

743
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:01,276
Say "uncle"! Say "uncle"!

744
01:09:07,326 --> 01:09:09,760
Don't start what you can't finish!

745
01:09:12,298 --> 01:09:13,560
Quit hitting yourself!

746
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:15,495
Quit hitting yourself!

747
01:09:16,035 --> 01:09:19,129
Oh, water tastes good, yes!

748
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,410
This isn't over yet.

749
01:09:28,514 --> 01:09:32,541
There's something I missed.
Some clue or motive I've overlooked.

750
01:09:32,852 --> 01:09:35,320
And that motive is...

751
01:09:36,455 --> 01:09:37,752
...plah!

752
01:09:38,023 --> 01:09:39,251
Think!

753
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,484
Someone wants the tribes
to destroy each other.

754
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,322
There must be something
valuable in this equation.

755
01:09:44,864 --> 01:09:47,025
Perhaps we should meditate, Spike.

756
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:50,329
For it is said that
when seeking answers, one must...

757
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:53,160
...quiet the soul in order
to hear them.

758
01:09:58,377 --> 01:10:00,504
What is it the Wachati possess...

759
01:10:00,913 --> 01:10:04,110
...that is of great value
to other men...

760
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:07,183
...besides the princess
with the amazing rack?

761
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:21,393
All right, then.

762
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:07,669
You're back?!

763
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:11,641
You can dispense with the smallpox,
all-knowing one.

764
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:15,349
I'm here on business,
and time is of the essence.

765
01:11:16,588 --> 01:11:18,112
Very well.

766
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:20,053
What answer do you seek?

767
01:11:20,259 --> 01:11:22,591
What do the Wachatis possess...

768
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:25,391
...that is of great
value to civilized man?

769
01:11:25,798 --> 01:11:29,359
The medallion will lead you
to the answer.

770
01:11:31,103 --> 01:11:34,129
You do still have
the medallion, don't you?

771
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,168
Medallion?

772
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:37,432
Why, surely.

773
01:11:38,177 --> 01:11:40,441
I left it back...

774
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,612
...with my body.

775
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:44,408
Your aura...

776
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,878
...is weakening.

777
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,612
Okay! I threw it in a cave!

778
01:11:49,788 --> 01:11:53,315
What do you want from me?
What are you? Mr. Perfect?!

779
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,890
Where is it?

780
01:11:55,094 --> 01:11:57,028
It's probably lying...

781
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,789
...in a big pile of...

782
01:12:16,348 --> 01:12:17,747
Guano!

783
01:12:19,018 --> 01:12:21,885
They have guano!

784
01:12:32,898 --> 01:12:34,422
Like...

785
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,663
...a glove.

786
01:12:40,205 --> 01:12:41,672
Hi, Chief!

787
01:12:42,341 --> 01:12:44,434
Appreciate your meeting me here.

788
01:12:45,711 --> 01:12:47,770
Let's go kick some...

789
01:12:49,181 --> 01:12:51,172
...consulate butt.

790
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,591
Hello, Ace.

791
01:13:03,695 --> 01:13:04,491
You want your money?

792
01:13:04,563 --> 01:13:07,259
Wrong again, Sweeney Toad.

793
01:13:07,499 --> 01:13:10,263
I've come for the sacred bat.
Where is it?

794
01:13:10,602 --> 01:13:11,534
Why...

795
01:13:11,937 --> 01:13:13,598
...whatever can you mean?

796
01:13:13,772 --> 01:13:15,103
Guano!

797
01:13:15,274 --> 01:13:16,434
Hello!

798
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,610
Does poop ring a bell?

799
01:13:19,945 --> 01:13:22,413
"Guano mines as a source of nitrate...

800
01:13:22,514 --> 01:13:25,142
"...producing 84% of
the world's fertilizer...

801
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,810
"...a $1.4 billion industry."

802
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,045
That's what this war is about.

803
01:13:30,556 --> 01:13:35,289
You can't take possession of the caves
while the Wachati inhabit the area.

804
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:37,725
And you want that dookie so bad...

805
01:13:37,896 --> 01:13:39,261
...you can taste it.

806
01:13:39,465 --> 01:13:40,625
I thought that...

807
01:13:40,799 --> 01:13:43,063
Yes, thank you, Fulton.

808
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,304
That's a fine theory, Mr. Ventura.

809
01:13:48,974 --> 01:13:50,635
What's it got to do with me?

810
01:13:51,643 --> 01:13:53,634
I thought you'd...

811
01:13:53,812 --> 01:13:55,404
...never ask.

812
01:13:59,318 --> 01:14:01,809
When I met you, there was
a white substance on your shoe.

813
01:14:01,887 --> 01:14:04,754
Yesterday, I saw the same
substance outside the hut...

814
01:14:04,923 --> 01:14:07,756
...and it hit me that
the Great White Bat has white guano.

815
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,355
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!

816
01:14:10,429 --> 01:14:13,330
And that explains the abrasion
on your palm!

817
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:15,430
Let me run that back for you.

818
01:14:21,173 --> 01:14:23,539
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!

819
01:14:23,609 --> 01:14:27,170
And that explains the abrasion
on your palm!

820
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:30,178
Damn, I'm good!

821
01:14:30,349 --> 01:14:31,839
Can you feel that?

822
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:33,340
Can you feel it...

823
01:14:33,485 --> 01:14:35,112
...Captain Compost?

824
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:39,821
The day of redemption is at hand!

825
01:14:40,926 --> 01:14:42,689
Repent!

826
01:14:43,362 --> 01:14:46,627
And thou shall be saved.

827
01:14:48,534 --> 01:14:49,796
Very good.

828
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:53,702
Very good.

829
01:14:54,306 --> 01:14:56,433
I believe you've solved the case.

830
01:14:56,542 --> 01:15:00,535
One thing I still don't understand,
Mr. Belvedere.

831
01:15:01,113 --> 01:15:04,344
If you are the slime behind
this little film-flam...

832
01:15:04,483 --> 01:15:06,041
...why, oh, why...

833
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:09,152
...did you hire me?

834
01:15:09,288 --> 01:15:12,485
I'm afraid there'll be
an investigation after the war.

835
01:15:12,658 --> 01:15:13,886
You were my alibi...

836
01:15:14,059 --> 01:15:17,051
...to prove I'd done
everything I could to stop it.

837
01:15:17,329 --> 01:15:18,387
Arrest him.

838
01:15:19,164 --> 01:15:20,495
Arrest him!

839
01:15:23,168 --> 01:15:24,396
Please arrest him.

840
01:15:26,405 --> 01:15:28,168
Simon says, "Arrest him."

841
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:40,848
I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. Ventura.

842
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:44,255
I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. Ventura.

843
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:49,257
Shall I stick him on the wall?

844
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:52,988
No, I don't think it'll be
necessary, Gahjii.

845
01:15:53,232 --> 01:15:57,464
Mr. Ventura has very cleverly stolen
the sacred bat of the Wachati.

846
01:15:57,669 --> 01:16:02,038
Unfortunately, we were unable
to recover it in time to stop the war.

847
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:04,701
Hit the lights!

848
01:16:06,845 --> 01:16:09,541
The switch is on the wall
beside you! Go for it!

849
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:20,883
Flick it!

850
01:16:24,896 --> 01:16:25,885
All right, then.

851
01:16:26,231 --> 01:16:28,290
Shall we go to jail?

852
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:40,977
What are you? H.R. Shove-n-Stuff?

853
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:43,905
Get in!

854
01:16:45,584 --> 01:16:47,245
Just one more thing.

855
01:16:54,993 --> 01:16:56,426
What are you doing?

856
01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:03,164
Stop it!

857
01:17:03,669 --> 01:17:05,261
I said, stop it!

858
01:17:14,179 --> 01:17:16,010
To the jungle, Boba!

859
01:17:31,697 --> 01:17:32,891
Friends...

860
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:34,290
...rodents...

861
01:17:34,633 --> 01:17:35,998
...quadrupeds!

862
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:38,526
Lend me your ears!

863
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,309
Imbecile! You let him get away!

864
01:17:49,448 --> 01:17:52,178
You don't seem to understand.
The tribe will be killed.

865
01:17:52,517 --> 01:17:54,542
Remind me to send a sympathy card.

866
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,415
We're going to get the bastard.

867
01:17:56,488 --> 01:17:58,547
There's nothing he can do now.

868
01:17:58,657 --> 01:18:01,490
We've got the bat, and it's nearly noon.

869
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,741
What the hell's going on?!

870
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,785
You see...

871
01:19:04,222 --> 01:19:08,022
...humans and animals
can live in harmony!

872
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:23,901
Sorry for the delay, Ace.

873
01:19:28,046 --> 01:19:29,809
Hey, poachers!

874
01:19:30,415 --> 01:19:31,404
Say hello...

875
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:34,542
...to my stinky little friend!

876
01:19:52,771 --> 01:19:54,432
Get out! Get out!

877
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:57,767
Not so fast, Sally!

878
01:20:01,146 --> 01:20:02,943
Get it away!

879
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:04,268
He wants to go off-road.

880
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:13,277
Nobody wants to play with me.

881
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,623
Loser!

882
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:39,802
From the consulate, right?

883
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,207
This is weird.

884
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:49,774
Noon.

885
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,874
The Wachati.

886
01:22:57,288 --> 01:22:59,279
The spirit will overcome.

887
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:02,221
The spirit will overcome.

888
01:23:37,829 --> 01:23:39,990
Head hunters!

889
01:24:02,687 --> 01:24:04,450
Shikaka!

890
01:24:16,034 --> 01:24:18,366
Coming through. Clear a path, people!

891
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:55,459
They will now consummate
the marriage as the tribe watches.

892
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:56,591
Well done, Ace.

893
01:25:56,801 --> 01:25:59,463
You must be extremely proud.

894
01:25:59,871 --> 01:26:01,270
Pride is an abomination.

895
01:26:01,806 --> 01:26:03,239
One must forego the self...

896
01:26:03,641 --> 01:26:06,235
...to attain spiritual creaminess...

897
01:26:06,778 --> 01:26:09,246
...and avoid the chewy chunks...

898
01:26:09,714 --> 01:26:11,477
...of degradation.

899
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:20,849
What's that he's he saying?

900
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:24,156
I think he's saying,
"She's not a virgin."

901
01:26:25,663 --> 01:26:27,255
They can tell that?
