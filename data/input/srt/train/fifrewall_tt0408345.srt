1
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,120
<i>Where's my blue bag?</i>

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,280
<i>I don't care. No.</i>

3
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,080
<i>- Pim, do you have him?
- I got him.</i>

4
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,760
<i>He's leaving the house.</i>

5
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,840
<i>He's late today.</i>

6
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,040
<i>- Where are you? Are you right there?
- No, I'm across the street.</i>

7
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,320
<i>- Get closer than that.
- I'm not gonna lose him.</i>

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,880
<i>- I'm not gonna lose him.
- Pay attention, guys.</i>

9
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,120
<i>9:01, down Granville Park. Again.</i>

10
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,240
<i>Okay, switch to channel seven.</i>

11
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,080
<i>Sarah!</i>

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,640
<i>Hi.</i>

13
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>Control the flow of traffic.</i>

14
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,480
<i>Come on! Come here, Rusty!</i>

15
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,080
<i>Rusty. Rusty, come here.</i>

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
<i>Come... Rusty!</i>

17
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,840
<i>Come on, boy.</i>

18
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,160
<i>Come on. We're gonna be late.</i>

19
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,840
<i>Hello, Jack.</i>

20
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,360
<i>- Sarah, could you turn it down, please?
- What?</i>

21
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,520
<i>The music, if that's what it is.
Turn it down.</i>

22
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
<i>- Why?
- Has anyone let the dog out yet?</i>

23
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,640
<i>- It's Sarah's turn! I did it last time!
- It takes, what, two seconds?</i>

24
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,840
Rusty, no! Leave it alone!

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,640
Come on!

26
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,440
<i>Andy, stop it.</i>

27
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,920
Andy! Mom, tell Andy to get that thing
out of here. It's screwing up the TV.

28
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,960
Idiot.

29
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,760
Andy, a little help here, okay?

30
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,040
- Moron.
- Idiot moron.

31
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,480
- Moron idiot.
- Nobody's an idiot.

32
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,760
- Except for her.
- Nobody's a moron.

33
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,040
- Except for her.
- Andy, stop it!

34
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,480
I'm trying to watch this.

35
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,680
Those two home together all week?

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,440
- There's no school till Monday.
- Oh, boy. What's your day like?

37
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,160
Finish the details on the Morgan house.
They're pouring the footings today.

38
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,160
Then I have to find a guitar teacher
for Sarah, pay some bills...

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,720
...and schlepping the kids.

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,640
You should get yourself a hobby,
keep yourself busy.

41
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,960
- I already have a hobby.
- Yeah?

42
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,760
And it's taking care of you.

43
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,880
I don't deserve you.

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,320
No, you don't.

45
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,280
We owe Arlin and Vee a dinner.
Wanna do it this week?

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,640
Well, they're home this week.
I just wanna be with the kids.

47
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,880
- Mom! Tell Andy to get that thing out!
- Really?

48
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,720
You should have Marci drop
my blue suit off at the cleaners.

49
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,920
Marci's in Manila till the 26th.

50
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,960
Here, sport, give me this for a second.

51
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,160
- Mom! Excuse me, does anybody care?
- This is what's doing it.

52
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,160
Put this in my office.
I'll show you how we can fix it.

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,560
Okay? And, yes, I do care.

54
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,040
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Jack.

55
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,280
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Andy.

56
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,560
Don't torture your sister.

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,640
Sarah, this dog needs to go out.
Don't forget his new collar.

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,480
- Sarah.
- Bye, Jack.

59
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,240
<i>Getting a welcome break in the weather
before getting hit by a couple of storms.</i>

60
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
<i>That'll make the drive more difficult.</i>

61
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,080
<i>Looks like smooth sailing this morning
heading into downtown Seattle.</i>

62
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,960
<i>We've been seeing slowdowns and
heavy traffic just about everywhere else...</i>

63
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,240
- Morning.
- Morning, Richard.

64
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,920
- Morning, Cindy. How are you?
- Morning, Jack. Great, thanks.

65
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,960
How do I say this, Bobby?

66
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,680
- No.
- Come on, Janet. I don't see why not.

67
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,080
Look, Bobby, here's how this works.
You ask me out, which you did.

68
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
I say no, which I did.

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,040
You say, "Okay," and ask somebody else.
You don't keep asking me.

70
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,360
At what point does it become
sexual harassment?

71
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,800
Right about now, Bobby.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,880
- Mr. Stanfield.
- Morning, boss.

73
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,080
- Kid's persistent.
- I don't know why.

74
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,920
- The usual reason, I suppose.
- Have you seen Ravi yet?

75
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,880
No, I'm on my way now, though.

76
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,600
Don't forget, merger meeting.

77
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,760
- Nice flowers.
- Born-again Bobby.

78
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,600
- Maybe he's trying to save your soul.
- He'd need bigger blossoms than that.

79
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
- Good morning, Betty.
- Morning.

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,360
- How we doing?
- Pike Street system's running slow.

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,360
I'll tell Carol when she gets in.
We'll get after it.

82
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,680
Merger goes through, we'll go in
and replace the whole thing.

83
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,320
Yeah.

84
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,240
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Rick.

85
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,640
Hey, Ravi. What have we got?

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,240
Brute-force login.
The interesting thing is...

87
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,080
...he's coming in through Hong Kong,
Korea and Malaysia...

88
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,480
...but he's trying sequential account
numbers. He's hacking all over.

89
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,320
Move over for me.

90
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,160
Let's try a rule change on him,
see what he does.

91
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,840
Put in an IPS signature
that black-holes the pattern.

92
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,520
- See if that slows him down.
- That'd slow me down.

93
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,000
- That'd be resistant to false positives too.
- Yep.

94
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,840
Thanks.

95
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,840
Loss is higher than one would expect,
considering your level of security.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,480
Just write it off?

97
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,680
That depends on how
you view the statistics.

98
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,120
They're not particularly high,
given the fact that...

99
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,680
...we're pushing the business into
some new and uncharted areas.

100
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,320
Online banking is where
the business is heading.

101
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,800
Where we have our branches...

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,560
...we'll provide our customers with
more ways to control their money.

103
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,920
As you can see by the chart,
after the merger...

104
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
...Accuwest will have 1100 branches
in 13 states...

105
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,360
...with over 100 billion in assets.
So to answer you, Harry, yes...

106
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,480
...we do see a reasonable level of fraud
loss as a cost of doing business.

107
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
- How many branches do you have?
- Twenty-seven.

108
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,960
As head of network security, Jack...

109
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,480
...you've never really had to think
in terms of economies of scale.

110
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,760
- But your philosophy of risk is...
- Wait a second, Gary.

111
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,440
Make this clear for me, will you?
What exactly is my philosophy of risk?

112
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,800
- No need to take this personally.
- I take it personally, goddamn it.

113
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,400
I've spent 20 years protecting this bank,
its customers and shareholders...

114
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,040
...from unnecessary risk.

115
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,480
Jack, I don't think you're hearing
what I'm saying.

116
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,280
I hear what you're saying.
Fraud loss is inevitable...

117
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,920
...pass it on to the customers
as the cost of doing business.

118
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,720
We don't wanna do that, do we?

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,960
We're all here to serve the customers.
Let's try and get along.

120
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,760
- We can have the best of both worlds.
- Doesn't exist, Arlin.

121
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,120
Look, I'm sorry. This went on
a little longer than I anticipated.

122
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,120
There's stuff I really have to get to.

123
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,640
- Okay, let's get on with it.
- Network attacks...

124
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,800
...network activity.

125
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,600
- Where is this guy?
- He's in reception.

126
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,080
He said it's personal. Should I get him?

127
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,120
No, I'll walk over there.

128
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,920
Mr. Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.

129
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,960
Jack Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.

130
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,760
- Do I know you?
- I know you.

131
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,840
- Do you have a card?
- Oh, yeah.

132
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,280
DHD Financial. What can I do for you?

133
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,320
You can give me
the $95,000 you owe me.

134
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,160
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?

135
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,080
I'm collecting for GambleNet U.S.A.
Does that ring a bell?

136
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,000
- No, it doesn't.
- You racked up 95 grand in online wagers.

137
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,600
And I got the paperwork to prove it.

138
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,160
You got the wrong Jack Stanfield.
I don't gamble.

139
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,120
- I don't have any debt. Check your facts.
- You're a deadbeat. See you in court.

140
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,960
- Laurie, call security.
- Don't bother, sweetheart.

141
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,440
Gambling's an addiction, Mr. Stanfield.
Get some help.

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,960
Well, I thought the idea was
to match it to the curtains.

143
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,760
- Yes, but if you do that...
- Nice flowers.

144
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Bobby?

145
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,120
That would be the wrong thing to do,
don't you think?

146
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,200
- What's up, partner?
- Take a look at this.

147
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,400
Who were you betting on?

148
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,240
I wasn't betting. I don't gamble.

149
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,120
- I don't even know how.
- Well, that's obvious.

150
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,920
You think somebody got my information off
the bank's internal network or what?

151
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,080
Are you doubting yourself
in your old age?

152
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,840
No. More likely a dumpster diver...

153
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
- ... somebody sifting through your trash.
- Maybe.

154
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,520
A debt collector showed up
this morning about it.

155
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,400
Don't worry. I'll clean it up.

156
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,040
It's just a pain in the ass.

157
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,080
Bill Cox? Guy from Atlanta.

158
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,200
- Supposed to have a drink.
- I can do 5:30.

159
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,120
I wanna get home early, pizza night.

160
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,480
- Good. I'll let him know.
- Okay.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
<i>- Hey, you.
- Hi, hon.</i>

162
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,080
<i>Harry and I need to see a guy
for a few minutes after work.</i>

163
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
<i>- Okay if I'm late?
- What are you thinking?</i>

164
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,280
<i>I don't know, 45 minutes, tops.</i>

165
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,680
We'll see you when we see you.
Love you.

166
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,040
<i>Love you too. Bye.</i>

167
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,840
I see him. My question is this:

168
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,960
Do we really wanna work
for those Accuwest morons?

169
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,240
- I'll listen to what he has to say.
- This guy could be our future.

170
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,440
Okay, okay.

171
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,640
- Bill.
- Good to see you, Harry.

172
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
- Bill Cox, Jack Stanfield.
- How are you?

173
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,280
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Please, sit.

174
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,880
Thank you.

175
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,400
Sarah, the pizza's here.
My wallet's by the door.

176
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,040
Is somebody gonna get that?

177
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,560
- Here you go.
- So listen...

178
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,880
...I don't know how much Harry's told you
about what I do.

179
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,400
Not a lot. Just that you're in banking.

180
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,520
I have a company that provides
banking-support services...

181
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,000
...mainly in the South, but, really,
I'm an old-fashioned entrepreneur.

182
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,040
If that's a scary movie, turn it off.
Your brother won't sleep for a week.

183
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,400
- I'm so sorry to make you...
- Hello.

184
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
- Sarah!
- Mom.

185
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,120
Call 911!

186
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,120
There's over 200 regional banks
in the U.S. Alone...

187
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,720
...that have nothing like the sophistication
of the system you developed for Landrock.

188
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,080
Sarah! Leave her alone!

189
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,520
With your system's software...

190
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,840
...Harry's expertise in law enforcement
and the physical security...

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,520
...you're an unbeatable team.

192
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,000
Hey! Come here!

193
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,360
No!

194
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
- What are you doing to me? Get away!
- Shut up!

195
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,160
You'd be your own bosses.

196
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,480
I'd just supply the money.

197
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,040
- Don't hurt my children.
- Shut up!

198
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,480
Oh, my God, what do you want?

199
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,080
I have to think about
a couple of other options...

200
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,360
...but this sounds very attractive.

201
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,800
Okay, good.

202
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,720
I hate to break this up.

203
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,520
- I gotta get home.
- Family man.

204
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,560
No! Daddy!

205
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,240
So how many kids do you have?

206
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,680
Two. Boy, 8. Girl, 14.

207
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,640
- Sure you don't need a ride?
- No, thanks, Harry. I'm fine.

208
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,080
Going back tonight?

209
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,880
- No, I've got some business here in town.
- Well, great meeting you. Take care.

210
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
She has beautiful eyes, your daughter.

211
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,480
What?

212
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,320
Jesus, what..?

213
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,600
Oh, my God. What do you want?

214
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,640
I wanna get you home. It's pizza night.

215
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
Drive.

216
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,680
Drive.

217
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,160
Liam, we're on our way.
Everything all right?

218
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Fine, the house is secure.
And we're setting up now.

219
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,840
I wanna talk to my wife.

220
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,360
You hear that, Liam?
He wants to talk to his wife.

221
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,480
They can't talk right now.

222
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,280
She's busy.

223
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,720
Who are you?

224
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,680
What's this about?

225
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,520
What do you want from me?

226
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,520
This is your exit, Jack.

227
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,000
<i>Three defenders had the chance
to put him on the ground.</i>

228
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,520
They're here.

229
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,280
<i>As good as he's been down the years.
Tremendous effort to stay alive.</i>

230
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,320
- Where are they?
- Through here.

231
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,120
Jesus.

232
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,440
- What is this?
- Daddy.

233
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,080
Why have you done this, for God's sake?

234
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,160
It's okay. They're children!

235
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
I said, "If they were trouble. "
Were they trouble?

236
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,200
- They were noisy.
- Yes, we made an executive decision.

237
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,640
But you're a criminal, Willy,
not an executive.

238
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,440
- But I thought you said...
- Shut up.

239
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,160
- Daddy.
- I wanna know what you want...

240
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,600
...and I wanna know now.

241
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,880
Beth...

242
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,280
...I'm sorry about all of this.
I am, but, well...

243
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,800
There we are.

244
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,880
I need you to talk to your husband.
He listens to you.

245
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,320
I need you to make him understand that
if he doesn't do exactly as I ask...

246
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,320
...I will kill you and your two children.

247
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,000
But if you can make him listen, Beth...

248
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,960
...if you can make him do what I want...

249
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,320
...you'll all walk away from
this unpleasantness unscathed.

250
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,120
Not because I'm a nice man...

251
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,200
...simply because there'll be no reason
for me to hurt you.

252
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,880
Make sense?

253
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,520
Can I rely on your cooperation?

254
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,520
- Just tell him yes.
- Yes.

255
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,960
Sarah?

256
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,360
Fine.

257
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,680
And you, big fella?

258
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
Maybe.

259
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,200
- Andy.
- No, it's all right. It's honest.

260
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,160
Do you keep a gun in the house, Jack?

261
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,080
No.

262
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,880
- Daddy!
- I'm okay.

263
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
- It's okay.
- Don't worry.

264
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,600
- It's okay.
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

265
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,000
Pass me the gun.

266
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,400
It's empty.

267
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
You lied to me, Jack.

268
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,040
Don't let it happen again.

269
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,240
You have an excellent alarm system.

270
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,600
What are alarms for, Andy?

271
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,240
- To keep people out.
- That's right.

272
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,880
And they also keep people in.

273
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,040
I'll need the password, Jack.

274
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,080
Lark.

275
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,920
Lark. It's the name of our boat.

276
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,560
All right.

277
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,760
Untie them.

278
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,800
Take it easy.

279
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
Daddy.

280
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,640
I'll be fine.

281
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,560
Hi, this is Jack Stanfield,
account number 51216.

282
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,400
I need to change our alarm code
and give you a new password.

283
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,400
I know it's difficult for you,
but try and get some sleep.

284
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,000
Mom, what's going on?

285
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,800
- What do they want?
- I don't know, sweetheart.

286
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,080
Do you want something to eat, Jack?

287
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,200
- I'm not hungry.
- No?

288
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
Do you have any wine?

289
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,040
There's some in the bar.

290
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,120
Pim, go and get me a nice bottle of red.

291
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,680
I don't know shit about wine, man.
How do I know if it's nice?

292
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,160
It'll be dusty.

293
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,160
I didn't know he had a gun.

294
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,800
They hit him so hard.

295
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,200
He'll be fine.

296
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,160
It's just a little lump on the head.

297
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,840
- Let's think about something nice, okay?
- Okay.

298
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,160
I know.

299
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,600
<i>We're onboard the Lark.</i>

300
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,800
And the sail's up.

301
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,800
And the sun is shining.

302
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,640
And it's warm.

303
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,520
And, Andy, you're at the wheel
with your dad.

304
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,520
Vel.

305
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,240
Get Jack a blanket.

306
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,920
He's got a busy day tomorrow.

307
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,120
She's asleep. Get some yourself.

308
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,680
- I'll wake you in an hour.
- Okay.

309
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>Let's take a look,
show you what's going on.</i>

310
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
<i>Yeah, we do have a big storm,
big section of the country.</i>

311
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,600
<i>It's gonna bring a variety of weather...</i>

312
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,600
Morning, Jack.

313
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,240
Time to get ready for work.

314
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,840
<i>You can look for some snow by tomorrow
through the upper Great Lakes.</i>

315
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,680
You have to do whatever they want.
I don't care what it is.

316
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,160
It may not be that easy.
We've seen their faces.

317
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,760
- But he said if we just cooperate...
- I know what they said, Beth.

318
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,720
<i>Did you ever notice
how big squirrels' teeth are?</i>

319
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,480
Where's Andy?

320
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,400
Breakfast.

321
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,520
- Count to three.
- One, two, three.

322
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,040
Andy!

323
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,720
Andy.

324
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,240
This man is not our friend. Stay away.

325
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,600
- But I want a pancake.
- Go see your mom.

326
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,000
- Want some Cheerios?
- No.

327
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,560
You're worried I'll give him
peanut oil, Jack.

328
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,840
I know about his allergy.

329
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,640
Don't imagine for one second...

330
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,000
...that I just blundered in here
out of the rain.

331
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,440
Don't touch him.

332
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,120
Don't talk to him.

333
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,600
And don't feed him anything.

334
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm fitting you with
two separate systems.

335
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,880
Audio transmitter.

336
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,720
We hear everything you do.

337
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,200
- What do I do when I get to the office?
- You do your work, Jack.

338
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,720
Chase that American dream.

339
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,240
The video camera,
with a wide-angle lens.

340
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,240
We see what you see.

341
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,120
I've cloned your cell phone.

342
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,760
Any call that you make or receive,
we can monitor.

343
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,040
- What about my family?
- Oh, they'll be safe...

344
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,800
...here with us.

345
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,600
Now, tuck your shirt in and go to work.

346
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,880
- Bye, pal.
- Bye, Dad.

347
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,480
You're a young man.

348
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,920
You don't need to be doing this.

349
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,160
The longer it goes on...

350
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,840
...the deeper in you are.

351
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,440
Let's stop it right now,
before it gets worse.

352
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Same to you, kid.

353
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,160
<i>You're gonna love me.</i>

354
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,800
- Those tickets I couldn't get? I got them.
- I need five minutes.

355
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,040
<i>The Dow Jones Industrial Average
is up 16 points to 10,255...</i>

356
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,680
<i>...on a volume of 22 million shares.</i>

357
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,240
<i>The NASDAQ Composite
is up 11 points...</i>

358
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,280
<i>...to 2,061 on a volume
of 1.6 million shares.</i>

359
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,040
Can you hear me?

360
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,880
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

361
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,120
<i>If you can hear me, tell your boss
I wanna speak to him.</i>

362
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,200
Tell him to quit dicking me around
and tell me what he wants me to do.

363
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,320
- Can you hear me?
- Jack? Are you okay?

364
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,240
Yes, I'm just talking to myself.
What's up?

365
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,280
Arlin wants to see you.

366
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,080
Yeah.

367
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,240
So you're an architect.

368
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,560
Yes.

369
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,800
And you designed this house.

370
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,720
I did.

371
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,720
It's nice.

372
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,840
Thanks.

373
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,560
How old is it?

374
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,160
Seven years.

375
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,480
- How much does a house like this go for?
- This is about robbing the bank, isn't it?

376
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,760
You're using Jack to help you
rob the bank.

377
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,280
Open a few doors
and press a few buttons.

378
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,160
Just look after the kids, Beth.

379
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,080
And, Vel, stick to your work.

380
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,760
I need you to try and get along.

381
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Arlin, I'm tired of him patronizing me.
Gary is an idiot.

382
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,120
Be that as it may, he's a fact of life...

383
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,880
...on top of which, you may be working
for him in a couple of weeks.

384
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,680
Okay. I'll take care of it.

385
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,640
Jack. Are you okay?

386
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

387
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,880
And Beth and the kids?

388
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,320
They're fine, Arlin.

389
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,800
Listen, Jack, Gary doesn't like you
very much...

390
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,520
...and based on your performance yesterday,
it's not hard to understand.

391
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,960
Also, we had a debt collector here
yesterday asking questions.

392
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,080
- What was that all about?
- Somebody compromised my identity...

393
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,200
...and ran up $95,000 worth
of online gambling debt.

394
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,720
Harry's taking care of it.

395
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,120
You know me, I...

396
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,280
I don't gamble. I don't have any debt.

397
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,720
Talk to Gary now.

398
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,200
- I want this merger to go smoothly.
- I can't today, I'm...

399
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,360
Today, Jack.

400
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,560
Okay. I'll take care of it. Thanks.

401
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,680
Are we on for dinner next week?

402
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,880
Yeah, let me check with Beth.

403
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,560
Looks good. Get it out there.

404
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,480
Gary?

405
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,760
Oh, yeah, Jack. Need something?

406
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,360
Yeah, I just wanted to have a word.

407
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,360
If...

408
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,120
If I seemed like I was a little abrupt...

409
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,960
...or difficult yesterday,
I wanna apologize.

410
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,440
I want you to know I am committed
to this process.

411
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,160
- Just having a bad day, that's all.
- Seem a little stressed. Everything okay?

412
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,520
- Yeah. I'm just fine, Gary. Thank you.
- You sure?

413
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,880
- Yeah.
- We can make this merger work...

414
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,920
...for everyone's benefit.

415
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,160
I'm here to help. If you ever do have
a problem, my door is always open.

416
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,640
Thank you, Gary.

417
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,080
Janet? Come in here
for a second, will you?

418
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,840
We'll do some letters.

419
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,840
Janet, if I've been difficult or distant...

420
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
<i>...for the last couple of days,
I hope you'll understand.</i>

421
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,600
<i>- I wanna apologize.
- That's okay.</i>

422
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,160
<i>We're a team, you and me.</i>

423
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,480
And I want you to understand how much
I appreciate what you do for me.

424
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,640
- Thanks, Jack.
- It means the world to me.

425
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,320
<i>Sometimes I think I just need to...</i>

426
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,880
...relax.

427
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,640
Okay.

428
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,120
- Take a minute.
- Okay.

429
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,640
Take five minutes out of the day...

430
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,360
<i>...and just sit quietly and take a break.</i>

431
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,640
<i>- You know, just...
- Sure. Jack...?</i>

432
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,680
He's lost it. Completely lost it.

433
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,920
Letter to Scott Smith.

434
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,440
Dear Scott, pursuant to your request...

435
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,960
<i>...for further information regarding
the security-interface issues...</i>

436
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,600
<i>...unfortunately, the information
that you requested is not available.</i>

437
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,360
<i>Sorry for the inconvenience.</i>

438
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Until the merger...

439
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,600
Shit. Strike that.

440
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,080
- Harry's in L.A. For a convention.
- Thanks for coming to tell me that.

441
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,280
I can refer you to my associate,
Gary Mitchell...

442
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,360
...who may be able to provide you
with the information.

443
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,920
- Regards to the family, usual close.
- Jack?

444
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,640
<i>Jack, I've been looking for you.</i>

445
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,360
Shit.

446
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,320
<i>- There's a Bill Redmond here to see you.
- Shit!</i>

447
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,640
<i>- Who?
- Redmond, from the Federal Banking Board?</i>

448
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,360
- What are you talking about, Federal..?
- Jack Stanfield?

449
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,600
Bill Redmond. Pleased to meet you.

450
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,280
Janet, close the door, please.

451
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,680
- Look...
- Oh, Jack, Jack, Jack.

452
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,400
Liam, take the boy downstairs
and break his knee.

453
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,800
Don't do that.

454
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,120
It's my fault, not his. It's my mistake.

455
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,240
Don't take it out on the boy.

456
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,640
Please.

457
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,120
- Please don't.
- Liam?

458
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,760
<i>Let him go!</i>

459
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,280
Leave him be for now.

460
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,720
I'd like a tour of the bank now, Jack.

461
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,920
I'm sorry, I have a terrible memory.

462
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,760
- What was your name?
- Janet Stone.

463
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,560
- Janet, can I borrow a pen?
- Sure.

464
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:43,720
That one'll do. I just need to write them
down once, and then they stick.

465
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,120
I didn't know about your meeting.
Who set it up?

466
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,200
It was a last-minute thing, Janet.
I forgot to tell you.

467
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,960
Now, I'm gonna give Mr. Redmond
a tour of the bank.

468
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,760
- Thanks.
- I'll find you if I need you.

469
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,120
- Good morning, Mr. Stanfield.
- Good morning.

470
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,960
- I have a guest, Mr. Redmond.
- Hi.

471
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,560
Hi.

472
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,040
Open sesame.

473
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Mr. Stanfield.

474
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,440
You'd think with so much plastic, there
wouldn't be any need for this real money.

475
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,040
How long do they keep the images
from those cameras?

476
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Fifteen days.

477
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,720
Thank you.

478
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,400
How do you expect
to get in and out of here?

479
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,280
I don't.

480
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,800
This is the real vault, isn't it, Jack?

481
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,680
Binary code.

482
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,520
Virtual money.

483
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,720
Tell me, how can it be stealing
if you can't even touch it?

484
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,000
That's it, huh? This is your plan?

485
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,280
You think your schoolboy techie friend
can hack into these servers?

486
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,880
This is what you kidnapped
my family for?

487
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,800
I don't need to hack into anything.

488
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,280
We're already inside.

489
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,280
All we need to do is plug in.

490
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,320
You're gonna log on to
a maintenance terminal...

491
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,480
...and run a prioritized search selecting the
accounts of your 10,000 richest customers.

492
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,960
And then with the program on this,
you'll withdraw $10,000 from each...

493
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,520
...and transfer the money
to my offshore accounts.

494
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,520
A hundred million dollars.
Wow, that's a lot of money.

495
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,000
- That's a good plan.
- Thanks, we like it.

496
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,480
At least it was last week.

497
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,440
Look around. Do you see any
maintenance terminals to plug into, huh?

498
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,160
The bank that took us over
had them removed.

499
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,320
There's nothing accessible from this room
anymore. Not from this building.

500
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,280
You're in the wrong town.
You should be in Wichita, Kansas, Bill.

501
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,120
You designed the software...

502
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,160
...you find me a way in.

503
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,240
I wouldn't know where to start.

504
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,640
Well, then you have
a big fucking problem.

505
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,040
- Looks like it's almost done.
- Yeah.

506
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,120
Andy!

507
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,680
Let him go.

508
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,520
- Come on...
- Okay, okay.

509
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,000
Answer the goddamn phone.

510
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,280
<i>- Hello.
- It's Tom.</i>

511
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,840
<i>- Hi, Tom.
- Something wrong?</i>

512
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,160
No, everything's okay.
I just dropped a bottle of milk...

513
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,640
...and it's just made
a big mess everywhere.

514
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,440
<i>- Listen, I thought we'd stop by...
- Thanks, but we're all down with the flu.</i>

515
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,200
<i>- All right, well...
- Okay. I gotta get back.</i>

516
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,360
<i>- Thanks, Tom.
- Okay.</i>

517
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,720
- Mom.
- Come on.

518
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,840
Are you all right? Okay, you're okay.

519
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,920
Don't you ever touch my children again,
do you hear me?

520
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,680
Shut your goddamn mouth.

521
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
From now on, you do as you're told!

522
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,320
- Roll down the window!
- What?

523
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,720
- How much is he paying you?
- Get back in!

524
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,600
- Five million dollars to get my family out.
- Get in the car or I call Bill.

525
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,640
There are traps in the system.
He's gonna get caught.

526
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,880
You're all gonna get caught, Willy.

527
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,760
- Five million dollars, right now.
- In the car, I mean it!

528
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,520
Get back in the car.

529
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,800
- What the hell happened, man?
- Nothing.

530
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,080
Exactly. So, what's the plan?
How do we get the money?

531
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,240
You are really beginning to bore me.

532
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,160
I want you and your wife
downstairs now.

533
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,560
How was your day, Beth?

534
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Am I supposed to believe you care?

535
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,680
Willy! Come down here!

536
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,040
Jack has broken our agreement
and decided not to cooperate.

537
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,320
Willy!

538
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,720
What's he talking about?

539
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,400
- It's just a game, honey.
- No, it's not a game.

540
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,840
Listen to your wife, Jack.

541
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,920
- Hey.
- Sit down, Willy.

542
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,360
So, Willy...

543
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,760
...what happened today?
How did Jack manage to hand over the pen?

544
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,440
I'm not exactly sure.

545
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,560
- I mean, everything seemed to be fine.
- Willy, I told you to watch him.

546
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,040
Everything was cool.
And then all of a sudden...

547
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,520
Listen, Willy...

548
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,240
...how can I expect Jack to do
as he's told if you don't?

549
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,080
Yeah, I don't know.

550
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,000
- I made a mistake. Sorry.
- We all make mistakes, Willy.

551
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,200
- Just not as many as you.
- Yeah, yeah, I said I was sorry.

552
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,520
All right.

553
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,960
Okay, you're sorry.

554
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,040
Watch them.

555
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,920
God Almighty.

556
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,560
Get out.

557
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,920
Oh, my God.

558
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,720
- What happened?
- Clean this mess up.

559
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,040
Shit! Liam, come here.

560
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,440
- What?
- He shot him.

561
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,040
Go through the basement.
Get the kids out of here.

562
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,440
- Shut up, Vel.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

563
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,040
Pretend to be watching television,
falling asleep.

564
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,760
- Nine o'clock, I'll divert them.
- Sit down now!

565
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,840
Beth, go to the bedroom.

566
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,200
Jack, over there.

567
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,640
Okay, honey.

568
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,560
- Don't really go to sleep, okay?
- Okay.

569
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,480
Just pretend to be asleep.

570
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

571
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,280
This is all gonna be over really soon.

572
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,720
What are you planning?

573
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,040
How are you gonna get me my money?

574
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
I don't know yet.

575
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,080
I'm working on it.

576
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,000
You've got 12 hours
till the bank opens, Jack.

577
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,040
Shit.

578
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,840
Go. Get Daddy's flashlight.

579
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,280
Okay, go.

580
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,920
- What's going on, Vel?
- It's fine. It's just some local interference.

581
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,320
Go check on Jack.

582
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,800
It's back.

583
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,760
Yeah, he's just sitting there.

584
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,240
Pim!

585
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,400
Vel, you stay here and watch.

586
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,440
Okay, go, honey, go.

587
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,000
Wait, honey.

588
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,560
- Mom.
- Let me go first, honey.

589
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,240
Pim, check the bedroom!
Vel, get these lights on now!

590
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,960
Fast as you can. Fast as you can.
Andy, go.

591
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,120
They're gone!

592
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,200
Liam, we need him.

593
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,800
They're not here!

594
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,880
Hello!

595
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,840
Yes, this is Jack Stanfield.

596
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,880
- You okay?
- Yeah.

597
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,560
I'm sorry. My son opened a door, and...

598
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,520
Yeah, I know.

599
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,160
Come on, honey, help me.
Ready? One, two...

600
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,960
They're in the garage!

601
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,400
Come here. Okay, go, go, honey.

602
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,240
Get out of..!

603
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,000
Mom!

604
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,800
Open the goddamn door now!

605
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,320
Stop!

606
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,400
Mom!

607
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,320
- Andy!
- Get them in!

608
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,640
- Leave them alone.
- Get up!

609
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,280
Mom!

610
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,200
Beth. Beth.

611
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,760
- Jack. Jack!
- All right! Move!

612
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,960
- Okay...
- Move!

613
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,880
...let's do this a different way.

614
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,640
You'll find a way in, Jack.

615
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,280
That's why we chose you.

616
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,600
Hey, you mind if I watch TV?

617
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,040
Where's my mom?

618
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,880
She's upstairs, asleep.

619
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,400
No, she's not.

620
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,280
- Where's my dad?
- He's in his office, working.

621
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,320
Well, can I see him?

622
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,920
No.

623
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,960
I know, I'm sorry.

624
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,920
I made a rule.

625
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,680
I'll let you see him in a bit, okay?

626
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,440
- Okay.
- Good.

627
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,880
Why have I got no sound?

628
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,000
Is it broken?

629
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,280
No. Give it to me.

630
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,360
<i>Fred, why don't you give up.</i>

631
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,520
So you're a genius.

632
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,760
Thank you.

633
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,160
- You want a cookie?
- Have they got nuts?

634
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,960
- Why?
- I'm allergic.

635
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,960
I'm sorry, Andy. I didn't know.
Let me check.

636
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,960
No.

637
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,240
No, no, no.

638
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,000
Not a peanut in sight. You're fine.

639
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,960
I promise.

640
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,160
Jack! Jack!

641
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,000
- Andy? Andy!
- Come on.

642
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,840
Come on, baby.

643
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,840
Breathe for Mommy. Come on, angel.

644
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,040
Andy, breathe for Mommy.

645
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,920
- He's going into shock.
- Is he breathing?

646
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,440
- Is he breathing?
- Barely. He's just barely breathing.

647
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,280
- It's not here.
- Come on, honey.

648
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,800
Get his backpack. Come on.

649
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,200
Stay with me, Andy. Stay with me.

650
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,480
- It's not here.
- Mom, it's not here!

651
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,400
Stay here. Stay here, Andy.

652
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:59,480
Oh, God. Come on, honey.
Do something, he's dying.

653
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,560
- Breathe for Mommy.
- Andy.

654
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,520
Give it to me, please.

655
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,960
I'll do whatever you want.
Give it to me, please.

656
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,720
Please.

657
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,040
Come on, breathe. Breathe!

658
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,200
- I've got it.
- He's not breathing.

659
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,680
I've got it.

660
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,800
Come on, baby. He's not breathing.

661
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,800
Okay. You're all right, honey.

662
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,880
- You're okay.
- He's okay. He's okay.

663
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,480
Are you all right, big fella?

664
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,960
Good.

665
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,040
I need my daughter's MP3 player
to use as a hard drive.

666
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,080
Honey.

667
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,360
I need to borrow your iPod.

668
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,440
Will I get it back?

669
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,880
Sure. I promise.

670
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,480
Here.

671
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,960
Thanks, sweetie. Go back to sleep.

672
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,280
This is the scanner head
from the fax machine.

673
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,680
Yeah.

674
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,800
And you'll capture the images of
the account numbers off the server screen...

675
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,280
...and transfer them to this.

676
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,760
Ten thousand songs,
10,000 account codes...

677
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,520
...it doesn't know the difference.

678
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,240
- How will you run the actual file?
- I won't.

679
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,040
I'll have the maintenance department
in Wichita do it.

680
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,360
But they're still just images.
What are you gonna do?

681
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,600
Use an OCR program to convert it to data
that the computer can use.

682
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,640
- Then use my merge program from the CD.
- That's right.

683
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,960
What about the money?

684
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,360
Then I just need access to a wire-transfer
terminal, and you'll get your money.

685
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,840
Vel?

686
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,840
It should work.

687
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,840
It better.

688
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,240
<i>- Hello?
- How'd it go?</i>

689
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,800
Fine, considering.

690
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,200
<i>How's it going at your end?</i>

691
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,760
I'll have it finished
by the time you get here.

692
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,920
I guess I never thought we'd pull this off.

693
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,440
<i>I know. What time does your flight get in?
I'll pick you up.</i>

694
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,840
Fire her.

695
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,600
What?

696
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,600
Fire Janet? Why?

697
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,200
I don't like the way she looks at me.

698
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,960
Fire her.

699
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,720
- Anything else?
- I'm good. Thanks.

700
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,880
- You're the only banker who drinks tea.
- I am?

701
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,160
Give us a minute, will you?

702
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,960
Janet, I want you to pack up your stuff
and go home.

703
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,200
What? What do you mean?

704
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,120
Just what I said.

705
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,800
Pack up your stuff and go home.

706
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,000
Why?

707
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,760
You're fired.

708
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,600
- If this is a joke, it's not funny, Jack.
- No, this is not a joke.

709
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,600
I'll call Human Resources. I'll get you a
job with somebody else at the bank.

710
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,840
- Right now, just do what I said.
- What are you talking about?

711
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,400
- Is this because of him?
- Don't argue with me.

712
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:09,320
- But, Jack, I haven't done anything wrong.
- Pack up your shit and get out of here.

713
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,160
Now.

714
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,720
Screw you, Jack.

715
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,200
When is Daddy coming home?

716
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,360
As soon as he can get them
some money from the bank.

717
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,480
And then they'll leave?

718
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,320
And then they'll leave.

719
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,840
<i>It was a good knife when you first got it.
Maybe six months later, it got dull.</i>

720
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,680
<i>Ever try to cut a tomato with these?</i>

721
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,360
Cox is gonna kill you.
You know that, don't you?

722
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,640
Just like Willy.

723
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,280
Willy made mistakes.

724
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,560
You think he'll reward you
because you're good?

725
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,520
- Shut up.
- Soon as he has the money...

726
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,440
- ... you'll be no more use to him.
- Go back into the bedroom.

727
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,360
He has no reason to let any of you live.

728
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,880
What I'm asking for isn't standard,
you know.

729
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,080
They might not do it.

730
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,920
They might say:

731
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,960
"We did it yesterday" or "It's scheduled
for tomorrow" or something.

732
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,440
Get on with it. Make it happen.

733
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,040
<i>- Operations.
- Stacy, Jack Stanfield in Seattle.</i>

734
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,920
<i>Hi, Mr. Stanfield.</i>

735
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,240
I need you to run
a maintenance sort program...

736
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,160
...weigh all online accounts,
largest to smallest.

737
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,400
<i>Give me a sec, I'll check.</i>

738
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,520
<i>Okay, keycard.</i>

739
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,960
Coming up. There you go.

740
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,760
<i>Ready to run.</i>

741
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,840
- I'm telling you, Arlin...
- Go and deal with it.

742
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,240
It's running, Stacy.

743
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,640
<i>Okay, if you need...</i>

744
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,200
Go.

745
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,200
With money moving every nanosecond...

746
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,640
...we have to provide a platform
for technology...

747
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,800
...to be able to maintain and control risk.

748
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,120
- You have to be thinking outside the box.
- Oh, I understand.

749
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,120
These geeks with their laptops can
figure out ways to steal money from you.

750
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,720
- Arlin, you lost?
- Hi, Jack.

751
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,360
No, Gary's trying to teach me something
about the new technology.

752
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,760
- Well, good luck.
- Yeah.

753
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,960
I told him you've been trying that
for years. What are you up to?

754
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,760
Well, there's a...

755
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,120
I came down because there was...

756
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,400
...a maintenance issue
with one of the servers.

757
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,280
Got the engineers coming down.

758
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,080
I asked to be notified
about all maintenance issues.

759
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,040
No one told me a server was down.

760
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,760
They probably didn't realize the procedures
changed. Wichita didn't call you?

761
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,400
No.

762
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,520
Who's "they"?

763
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,320
I don't know. Janet took the call.

764
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,440
Did you fire her this morning?

765
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,720
You know, Arlin,
it just wasn't working out.

766
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,960
Seems kind of sudden.

767
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,640
Well, actually, it's been...

768
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,720
It's been building for a while.

769
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,320
Well, care to join us?
Help Gary unlock my analog brain?

770
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,240
I think I'd better get back to the office.

771
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,880
I'll check with you later.

772
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,000
All right, Arlin, you gotta
understand two things:

773
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,640
- Number one, analog is for sissies.
- So I gathered.

774
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,520
He didn't wash his hands.

775
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,640
That's why you should never eat
peanuts off a bar.

776
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,520
Let's go.

777
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,440
Can I take his collar off?

778
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,880
- No, honey. He needs that.
- Beth, come with me, please.

779
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,200
- Where?
- Just downstairs.

780
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,040
Mom.

781
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,560
- It's okay. I'll be right back.
- Now, Beth.

782
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,920
Why do you hate us so much?

783
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:15,240
I don't hate you, Sarah.
I just don't care about you.

784
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,640
I need you to make a call.

785
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,360
Why..? Why would I say this?

786
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,800
Make him believe you.

787
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,920
Well, hopefully, that's the way...

788
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,400
Which one is he?

789
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,760
The kid in the blue shirt.

790
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,440
Come here.

791
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,680
Mr. Stanfield, sir?
Why did Janet get fired?

792
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,560
- She didn't do anything.
- We know what you're up to, Bobby.

793
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,440
What I'm up to?
What do you mean?

794
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,880
You and Janet have made repeated
attempts to access secure information.

795
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,360
No, that's ridiculous.

796
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,280
She rolled over on you, Bobby.
She gave you up.

797
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,960
What are you talking about, sir?

798
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,280
Sit down. Sit down.

799
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,240
We'll be in touch, Bobby.

800
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,760
Hello?

801
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,520
It's done.

802
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,000
Vel, is the money there?

803
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,360
Okay, good.

804
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,120
I've done everything you want.
When do I get my family back?

805
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,360
We have some tidying up to do.

806
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:52,280
Sir, I just wanted to say, regardless
of what you may have heard...

807
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,480
There are hidden cameras
in all the public areas...

808
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,520
...and some of the more sensitive areas
on the secure floors.

809
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,960
So you can see
the whole bank from here?

810
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,240
These are archive files.

811
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,360
Ninety-one cameras
running on 20 screens.

812
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,200
Wow, I bet you don't watch much TV
when you get home.

813
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,160
I don't even have one.

814
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,800
- Sorry. Sorry.
- I got it.

815
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,880
Okay.

816
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,640
- At least it didn't end up in the keyboard.
- Right.

817
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,600
We better get out of here before
we completely screw things up.

818
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,440
- Thanks. Sorry.
- Thank you.

819
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,480
All right.

820
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,080
- Where's Jack Stanfield?
- He just left.

821
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,080
- What was he doing in here?
- Making one hell of a mess.

822
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,240
- What the hell?
- What's wrong?

823
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,840
All the camera files have been deleted.

824
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,760
- What is this?
- Just press "send. "

825
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,000
Now there's no network,
no account details.

826
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,160
No trace of the 100 million.
Can I have the disk, please?

827
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:57,400
Vel has a real talent
for being destructive...

828
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,280
...do you not think?

829
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,120
See you at the house, Jack.

830
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,960
Jack, what's going on?
What are you up to?

831
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,800
- I haven't got time for this now.
- You're gonna make time.

832
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,080
You'll stay here and explain what you were
doing in areas you're not supposed to be in.

833
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,200
No, I'm not.

834
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,760
- Mr. Stanfield, the network...
- Tell him.

835
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,720
- What is it?
- The network just crashed.

836
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,800
- The whole floor?
- No, the whole building.

837
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,680
Stanfield!

838
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,760
Jack! Stop right there!

839
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,640
Jack!

840
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,200
- Get out of the car!
- Are you nuts?

841
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,880
- You're nuts!
- Get away.

842
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:06,240
Security-camera files are missing,
the computers just crashed!

843
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,560
Call the police.

844
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,520
Security. We're in the garage,
get the police.

845
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,680
Shit.

846
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,360
Beth?

847
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,040
Beth!

848
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,000
Beth!

849
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,960
Beth?

850
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,520
Oh, my God.

851
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,840
Where are they? Where's my family?

852
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,360
Yeah, we're leaving now.

853
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,240
I'll meet you when I'm done.

854
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,720
Yeah, will do.

855
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,080
- Cox says goodbye.
- Are they alive?

856
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,040
Just tell me that. Are they alive?

857
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,680
- Come on, man, talk to me.
- We're leaving now, Jack.

858
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,200
Why? Just kill me here.
Why should I make it easy?

859
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,120
You still think there's a chance you might
be able to help them. Now, let's go.

860
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,920
<i>Hi, it's Harry. Leave a message.</i>

861
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,240
<i>Harry. Jesus, Harry, where are you?</i>

862
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,360
I'm in trouble. I'm in real trouble.

863
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,200
I need...

864
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,800
I need to talk to you.

865
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,840
Call me on my... No, you can't.

866
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,680
You can't call me on my cell.

867
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,800
They're listening.

868
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,040
Shit.

869
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,720
It's really coming down, huh?

870
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,440
- What a night.
- Well, it is Seattle.

871
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,720
<i>Harry. Jesus, Harry, where are you?</i>

872
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,680
<i>I'm in trouble. I'm in real trouble.</i>

873
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,240
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

874
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,600
<i>Call me on my... No, you can't.
You can't call me on my cell.</i>

875
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,160
<i>They're listening. Shit.</i>

876
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,080
<i>This is Dr. Hay's office confirming
your 8 a. m. Appointment Monday.</i>

877
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,760
<i>So we'll see you then.
Thank you. Bye-bye.</i>

878
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,840
<i>Harry, I did it. I finally left him.</i>

879
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,480
<i>God, I love you so much.</i>

880
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:04,200
<i>I'm afraid. Get out of there, okay?
Come as soon as you can.</i>

881
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,360
<i>I love you.</i>

882
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,520
<i>Harry, it's Eric at Redline.</i>

883
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,920
<i>I found a guy who's selling those
Porsche 356 parts you...</i>

884
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,480
Yeah, come on in.

885
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,240
Thank you.

886
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,880
Wow, quite a place.

887
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,520
Yeah. I wanted something sort of
Dean Martin-ish, you know what I mean?

888
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,240
Well, you nailed it.

889
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,880
You know, I had my doubts.

890
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,360
But after our meeting...

891
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,680
...I could tell Jack was
definitely interested.

892
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,440
And the timing was perfect.

893
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,920
Without the merger, Jack would
never consider leaving the bank...

894
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,040
...and starting up on his own.

895
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,160
- How about a beer?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

896
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,240
Once Jack gets his teeth into it,
there'll be no stopping him.

897
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,640
Thanks for pulling that proposal
together so fast.

898
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,600
- You know, I think I will have that beer.
- You bet.

899
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,720
Harry?

900
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,600
Harry?

901
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,880
Oh, Jesus.

902
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,920
Sure it wasn't the TV, Mrs. Levy?

903
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,960
<i>No, it wasn't the damn TV. I'm telling you,
the guy had a gun in his hand.</i>

904
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,560
Okay, what'd the guy look like?

905
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,440
<i>He was wearing a gray suit with,
like, a necktie.</i>

906
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,000
Shit.

907
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,120
Taxi.

908
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,120
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

909
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,800
Let's go inside and play. Get your toy.

910
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,760
Janet?

911
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,480
Janet...

912
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,320
Janet Stone. She...

913
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,520
- Thank you.
- Over there.

914
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:45,920
Janet.

915
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,480
- Janet. Janet, let me in, please.
- What are you doing here?

916
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,200
- Get out of here, Jack. You're crazy!
- Let me in.

917
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,480
Get out!

918
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,680
Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.

919
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,560
The man who was in my office.

920
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,440
Mr. Redmond. He's a bank robber.

921
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,920
He's got Beth and the kids.
He's gonna kill them.

922
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,080
They may be dead already.
I need your help.

923
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:16,480
Do you understand me?
I need your help to try and save them.

924
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,760
Okay.

925
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,880
- I understand.
- Don't scream.

926
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,520
- Sorry.
- Shouldn't we call the police?

927
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
No. No police.

928
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,920
What about Harry?

929
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,840
Harry's dead.

930
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,920
Jesus.

931
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,120
I was at Harry's apartment when Cox...

932
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,960
...or Redmond, whatever his name is,
shot him.

933
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,640
People there saw me
with a gun in my hand.

934
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,520
There's a dead man in my house.

935
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,440
By the time I explain to the police...

936
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,840
- ... Beth and the kids could be dead.
- God.

937
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,880
I need you to help me find Bobby.

938
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,040
- Bobby? Why?
- I need his cell phone.

939
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:13,080
I used his phone to photograph
some account code numbers.

940
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,320
I've gotta have it to get the money back.
Can you help me?

941
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,040
Yeah. I'll find his number.

942
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:41,720
Why can't you get
a rare burger anymore?

943
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,960
E. Coli.

944
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,240
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Did you talk to Liam?

945
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:53,080
- No, not yet.
- Where the hell is he, man?

946
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,160
- Let's go.
- Now?

947
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,120
Yeah, now!

948
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,000
Shit.

949
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,160
You guys need to go to the washroom?

950
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,960
Don't say I didn't ask.

951
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,480
Jack.

952
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,800
- Jesus.
- I found Bobby.

953
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,080
Oh, great.

954
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,600
- It's Cox.
- Are you gonna answer?

955
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:33,600
I'm not ready to talk to him yet.
I need Bobby's cell phone first.

956
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,920
- And I'll need your laptop.
- No problem.

957
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,760
- And can we use your car?
- Problem.

958
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,880
Pop it! Pop it! Pop the clutch!

959
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,840
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

960
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,840
Keep the gas up.

961
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,320
I can't believe Harry's dead.

962
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,960
Was he involved with Cox?

963
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,920
No.

964
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,680
No. Harry thought he was a businessman.

965
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,360
But didn't Harry introduce you to Cox?

966
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,360
The whole...

967
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,040
...investment thing was just a scam.

968
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,880
Cox was using Harry to get next to me.
Harry didn't know about the robbery.

969
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,880
Cox killed him with my gun...

970
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:42,800
...to make it look as if I shot him
in a jealous rage over Beth.

971
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,760
Harry and Beth? Give me a break.

972
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:51,840
He planted a message from Beth
on Harry's answering machine.

973
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,840
Saying she...

974
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,800
Saying she was leaving me.

975
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:08,400
I also found some encrypted files
on his computer.

976
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,560
I'm sure they'd tie him and me
together in the robbery.

977
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,280
Cox had it all planned out.

978
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,000
Even the gambling debts.

979
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,440
We hatch this plan to rob the bank...

980
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,920
...then I find out my buddy is
sleeping with my wife.

981
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:27,080
After the robbery, I go to his apartment,
I kill him and I...

982
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,120
I disappear with the money forever.

983
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,080
Forever, as in dead?

984
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:41,440
I killed the man who was
supposed to kill me.

985
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,760
Be right back.

986
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,000
- What are you doing?
- I didn't tell Jack any of that stuff.

987
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,880
- Why did he say you did?
- I don't know. I'm sorry about that.

988
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,560
Can I borrow your cell phone?

989
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,000
Your cell phone, do you have it?
Can I borrow it?

990
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,400
Thanks.

991
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,920
- Here.
- Great.

992
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,600
Please let this work.

993
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,560
- Here we go.
- Now what?

994
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,160
I just need to find
a wire-transfer terminal.

995
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,480
Where are you gonna find
a bank open at this hour?

996
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,760
<i>Welcome to Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport.</i>

997
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,640
Jack, you look like a bank robber.

998
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,000
- Keep the motor running.
- Good luck.

999
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,400
Thank you.

1000
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,560
We'll see you in the morning.

1001
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,080
I'm sorry, we're closed.

1002
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,280
I need to get on your
wire-transfer terminal.

1003
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,960
Absolutely. I'm sorry.

1004
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:18,360
We usually don't have
a supervisor here this late.

1005
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,080
- You can use this one.
- Thank you.

1006
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,680
The money is put away. I...

1007
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,440
It's not about the money.
Sit down. Sit down.

1008
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,240
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1009
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:35,480
8499116...

1010
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,280
Liam, where have you been?

1011
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,280
Change of plans, asshole.

1012
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,480
Jack. Where are you?

1013
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:08,960
At a bank. I just hacked
into your Cayman Island accounts.

1014
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,200
<i>- That's impossible.
- You think so?</i>

1015
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:15,240
<i>I have your account details.
You just lost 20 million.</i>

1016
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,360
Bullshit.

1017
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,120
What's going on?

1018
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:29,560
Check the accounts.

1019
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,560
- What for?
- Can you check the accounts, please?

1020
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,800
Yeah.

1021
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,040
There goes another 20 million.

1022
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,600
- Come on.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

1023
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,880
We're down 40 million.

1024
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:53,440
Now you know what it feels like
to lose what you love.

1025
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,120
- Another account just cleared.
- That was for Harry.

1026
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,800
Your family are dead. Do you hear me?
They are dead!

1027
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
For all I know, they're dead already.

1028
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,320
He emptied another one.

1029
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,360
You're down to your last 20 million.

1030
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,160
- Talk to your husband.
- Jack?

1031
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:20,000
<i>I love you. Just do whatever you can
to save the children.</i>

1032
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,760
I am, baby. I love you too.

1033
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,360
Put the money back
or I'll put a bullet through her head.

1034
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,120
You do anything to her or my children...

1035
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,200
<i>...and you don't get a dime.</i>

1036
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,600
It's all gone.

1037
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,480
Jack, calm down.
If you calm down, we can talk this...

1038
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,000
You'll get the money
when I get my family.

1039
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,040
Tomorrow morning, when the banks open.
I'll let you know where.

1040
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,960
<i>- Yeah, I'll be there.
- Do you hear me?</i>

1041
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,400
<i>- I'll be there. Just...
- Don't bother calling me.</i>

1042
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,560
Because I've got nothing to say to you.

1043
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,720
- You need to get out of here.
- What?

1044
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,800
- I pushed the silent alarm.
- When?

1045
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,200
A couple of minutes ago. I'm sorry.

1046
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,600
Liam was gonna take care of him.

1047
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:06,200
Put the woman back in the van.

1048
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:10,360
- How you gonna give me my money?!
- Put her back in the van!

1049
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,280
Shut up!

1050
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,440
Shit.

1051
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,160
- Move it!
- Just a second. Here he is.

1052
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,800
- Get out of here, now.
- Sorry.

1053
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,720
What happened?

1054
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,040
They're alive.

1055
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,440
Thank God.

1056
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:45,120
I just bet everything on Cox's greed.

1057
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,040
I got the money.

1058
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,520
So we still got a chance.

1059
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,640
What are you gonna do?

1060
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,680
I'm gonna meet Cox at the bank
in the morning.

1061
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,600
- How are you gonna get in?
- I can't. You can.

1062
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,800
You fired me, remember?
I don't have a pass.

1063
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,320
Barking. Jesus, he was barking.

1064
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,760
- Jack?
- He was...

1065
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,640
Pull over. Pull over here.

1066
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,000
Jack, what are you doing?

1067
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,320
I heard Rusty barking.

1068
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,480
- He's with Beth and the kids in the van.
- So?

1069
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:30,400
He's got this...

1070
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,960
...GPS. He's got this GPS thing.

1071
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,960
You're not making any sense.

1072
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,200
He was running away all the time...

1073
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,560
...so we got him a collar
with a GPS locator.

1074
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:43,600
It's from this website.
If he's still got it on...

1075
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,880
Got him. There they are.

1076
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,720
What are they doing?

1077
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,200
Driving out of town.

1078
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,520
Why is he doing that?
Didn't he say he would meet you here?

1079
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,160
- Here. Get in the car.
- What are you doing?

1080
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,120
I'm gonna find my dog.

1081
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,400
Can you shut the dog up?

1082
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,080
It's okay, Rusty.

1083
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,760
You know, you're never
gonna get that money now.

1084
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:35,240
But if you turn around and take us back, my
husband can give you whatever you want.

1085
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,280
- You can split it between the two of you.
- Shut the damn dog up!

1086
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,280
Jack.

1087
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,840
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah.

1088
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,920
- You want me to drive?
- No. No, I'm fine.

1089
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,520
Where are they now?

1090
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,000
They're still on the 2.

1091
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,120
They just turned off the road.

1092
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:45,000
There's nothing on this map
except a big lake and some railroad tracks.

1093
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,440
- How far?
- Twenty miles.

1094
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,240
Where the hell are they going?

1095
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,600
Shut up.

1096
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:59,160
Shut your goddamn dog up.
I swear to God.

1097
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,920
It's okay, Rusty.

1098
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,160
- Come here, Rusty. Come here.
- Shut up!

1099
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,680
That's it!

1100
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,160
I warned you!

1101
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,200
What are you doing? No! Rusty!

1102
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:17,080
Shut up or you're going next!

1103
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,720
- Rusty! Sorry, baby.
- Quiet!

1104
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,840
You hear me?

1105
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,120
Put them in the back room.

1106
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,880
Maybe we should just forget it.

1107
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,560
Let them all go.

1108
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,000
Maybe you should do your job
and put them in the back room.

1109
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:18,080
Why would he bring them
all the way out here?

1110
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,960
I don't think he was planning
on leaving anyone alive.

1111
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,960
God.

1112
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,640
- Hey.
- Oh, my God. Come here.

1113
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,080
- It's all right.
- Hey.

1114
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:43,200
- He can't breathe.
- Sit your ass down. I don't give a rat's ass.

1115
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,760
- I'm sick of you people, man.
- Honey.

1116
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,000
Vel.

1117
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,920
Please help us.

1118
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,080
We need to exchange you...

1119
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:08,200
...for the money,
and then we'll let you go.

1120
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,920
Okay?

1121
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,320
You'll be all right.

1122
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,760
Thank you.

1123
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,480
They're slowing down.

1124
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,160
Look.

1125
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,040
Rusty.

1126
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:41,960
Rusty.

1127
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:45,000
Come here, Rusty. It's okay.

1128
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,200
Where are they, Rusty?

1129
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,600
Where have they gone?

1130
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,920
Where's Andy?

1131
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,400
There's a house down there by the lake.
I see Beth's car.

1132
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,080
- You got a cell phone?
- Yeah.

1133
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,520
Call the police.

1134
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,160
Shouldn't we just wait here
for the police?

1135
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:08,720
No.

1136
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,600
I can't. I can't wait.

1137
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,240
Thanks for everything.

1138
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,480
You got your job back.

1139
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,240
Will he call?

1140
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,200
You think he'll just give us the money,
no police?

1141
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:05,280
He knows I'll kill his family if he doesn't.

1142
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,520
I just need to up the ante a little.

1143
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,120
No. Please don't.
What are you doing?

1144
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,080
- Let her go!
- No!

1145
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,800
Stop it!

1146
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:24,920
- My God!
- Oh, my God!

1147
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,480
- Come on.
- Shut up!

1148
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,080
Why are you doing this?

1149
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,560
Pim!

1150
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,320
Come here!

1151
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:56,200
Where you at, sweetie? Wanna play?

1152
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:58,600
Marco.

1153
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,480
Polo.

1154
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,560
Marco.

1155
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,200
Polo.

1156
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,160
Hey!

1157
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,840
- Help! We're in here!
- Come on!

1158
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,680
Dad!

1159
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,920
- Dad!
- Run, Sarah. Run and hide!

1160
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:49,920
- Move it!
- Dad!

1161
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,560
Put him down. Let him go! Oh, my...

1162
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,800
Get upstairs now!

1163
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,200
Come on, get up the stairs!

1164
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:11,680
- Move it! Move it!
- Let me go!

1165
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,720
Go on, now. Move it! Get up there!

1166
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:28,960
Daddy!

1167
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,160
Daddy!

1168
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,280
- Jack!
- Run, Beth! Run!

1169
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,160
Run.

1170
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,320
Beth.

1171
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,920
Beth!

1172
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:41,640
Jack?

1173
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,800
Beth!

1174
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:48,400
Jack!
