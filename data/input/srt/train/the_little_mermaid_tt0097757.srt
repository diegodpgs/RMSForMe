Now, the snarfblatt dates back to prehistorical times

106

Careless and reckless behavior!

138
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,780
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

But it wasn't her fault.

142
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,837
First, the shark chased us.

143
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,424
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
But we couldn't, and he...

144
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,593
And... And we... Whoa!

145
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,637
And then we were safe.

146
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,391
But then this seagull came, and it was,
"This is this, and that is that, and..."

147
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,642
Seagull?

148
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,935
What?

149
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,230
You went up to the surface again, didn't you?

00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,774

154
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,494
- Daddy, they're not barbarians.

155
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,705
Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter

157

I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child any more.

158
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,837
Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady!

159
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,382
As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!

- Not another word!

And I am never, never to hear of
you going to the surface again!

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,724
Is that clear?

163
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,691
Teenagers.

00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,068
They think they know everything.

165
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,906
You give them an inch, they swim all over you.

166
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,784
Do you think I was too hard on her?

167
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,495
Definitely not.

168
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:54,500
Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was boss.

169
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:58,629
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.

170
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,632
No, sir. I'd keep her under tight control.

171
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,593
- You're absolutely right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

172
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,513
- Ariel needs constant supervision.
- Constant.

173
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,224
Someone to watch over her, to keep her out of trouble.

174
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,517
All the time.

175
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,102
And you are just the crab to do it.

176
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,690
How do I get myself into these situations?

177
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,776
I should be writing symphonies,

178
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,029
not tagging along after some headstrong teenager.

179
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,119
What is that girl up to?

180
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,742
Ariel, are you okay?

181
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,953
If only I could make him understand.

182
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,332
I just don't see things the way he does.

183
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,670
I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things

184
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,338
could be bad.

Ariel, what are you...
How could you... What is all this?

233
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,577
It's... It's just my collection.

234
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,705
I see.

235
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,415
Your collection.

236
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,835
If your father knew about this place...

237
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,670
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

238
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,215
Please, Sebastian, he would never understand.

239
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,344
Ariel, you're under a lot of pressure down here.

240
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:01,515
Come with me, I'll take you home
and get you something warm to drink.

241
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,518
- What do you suppose...
- Ariel?

242
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,395
Ariel?

Ariel, what are you...

244
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,454
Jumpin' jellyfish!

245
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:31,378
Ariel? Ariel! Please! Come back!

246
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,960
Max! Here, boy!

247
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,969
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?

248
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,138
Come on, Max.

249
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,349
Good boy. Good boy.

250
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,692
Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh?

251
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,445
Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you.

252
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,822
I got ya. I got ya.

253
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,367
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!

254
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,788
I've never seen a human this close before.

255
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,960
He's very handsome, isn't he?

256
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,464
I don't know. He looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.

257
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,050
Not that one.

258
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,677
The one playing the snarfblatt.

259
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,181
Silence, silence.

260
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,309
It is now my honor and privilege

261
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,519
to present our esteemed Prince Eric

262
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,148
with a very special, very expensive,

263
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,359
very large birthday present.

264
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,488
Grimsby, ya old beanpole, you shouldn't have.

265
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,906
I know.

266
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,575
Happy birthday, Eric.

267
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,374
Gee, Grim...

268
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,212
It's... It's really somethin'.

269
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,381
Yes, I commissioned it myself.

270
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,301
Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present.

271
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,887
Come on, Grim. Don't start.

272
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,806
Look, you're not still sore because I didn't fall for

273
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,058
the Princess of Glowerhaven, are you?

274
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,478
Oh, my! Eric, it isn't me alone.

275
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:58,525
The entire kingdom wants to see you
happily settled down with the right girl.

276
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,987
She's out there somewhere. I just...

277
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,240
I just haven't found her yet.

278
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,576
Perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.

279
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,329
Believe me, Grim, when I find her, I'll know.

280
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:16,042
Without a doubt, it'll just, bam, hit me, like lightning.

281
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,591
Hurricane a-comin'!

282
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,929

I can't stand it. It's too easy.

323
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,016
The child is in love with a human.

324

And not just any human. A prince!

325
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,898
Her daddy will love that.

326
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:34,360
King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl

327
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:39,282
would make a charming addition to my little garden.

328
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,880
Ariel, dear, time to come out.

329
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,923
You've been in there all morning.

330
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,762
What is with her lately?

331
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,479
- Morning, Daddy.
- Well!

332
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,820
- She's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?

333
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,324
Isn't it obvious, Daddy? Ariel's in love.

Ariel? In love?

335
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,873
Okay. So far, so good.

336
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,709
I don't think the king knows.

337
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:36,464
But it will not be easy keeping
something like this a secret for long.

338
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,967
He loves me.

342
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,103
Ariel, stop talking crazy!

343
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,647
I gotta see him again, tonight.

and back in the water where it belongs?

346

I'll swim up to his castle, then Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.

The sea king?

Something about Ariel.

414

He knows.

415
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,009
Hey, let's see now.

416
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,928
Who could the lucky merman be?

- Sebastian.

422
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,415
I'm concerned about Ariel.

423
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,960
Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately?

424
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:30,049
- Peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

425
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,886
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

426

Well, I...

428
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,643
Sebastian?

429
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,400
I know you've been keeping something from me.

430
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,486
Keeping something?

431
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,655
About Ariel?

432
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,619
- Ariel?
- In love?

433
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,750
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

434
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:08,671
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad! They are trouble!

435
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,298
Humans? What about humans?

436
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,343
Humans?

437
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,306
Who said anything about humans?

438
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,438
Flounder, why can't you
just tell me what this is all about?

439
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,815
You'll see. It's a surprise.

440
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,486
Flounder.

441
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,656
Flounder, you're the best!

442
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:39,493
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

443
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,331
Why, Eric, run away with you?

444
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,128
This is all so, so sudden.

445
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,550
Daddy?

446
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,891
I consider myself a reasonable merman.

447
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:07,229
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.

448
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,564
But, Dad, I...

449
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,650
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?

450
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,985
Daddy, I had to...

451
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,614
Contact between the human world
and the mer-world is strictly forbidden.

452
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,492
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

453
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:23,078
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

454
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,539
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

455
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,584
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

456
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,128
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fish-eaters

457
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,755
incapable of any feeling...

458
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,715
Daddy, I love him!

459
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,218
No!

460
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,054
Have you lost your senses completely?

461
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,931
He's a human. You're a mermaid.

462
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,432
I don't care.

463
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,686
So help me, Ariel, I am going to get through to you.

464
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:51,607
And if this is the only way, so be it!

465
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,279
Daddy! No!

466
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,865
No! Please!

467
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,619
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!

468
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,582
Daddy, no!

469
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,066
Ariel, I...

470
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,442
Just go away.

471
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:59,383
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.

472
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:04,388
She has a very serious problem.

473
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,809
If only there were something we could do.

474
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,854
But there is something.

475
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,483
Who... Who are you?

476
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,736
Don't be scared.

477
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,114
We represent someone who can help you.

478
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:27,202
Someone who can make all your dreams come true.

479
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,413
- Just imagine...
- Just imagine...

480
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,498
You and your prince...

481
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,044
- Together forever.
- Together forever.

482
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,171
I don't understand.

483
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:43,010
Ursula has great powers.

484
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,347
The sea witch?

485
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:50,309
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.

486
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,520
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!

487
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,689
Suit yourself.

488
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,401
That was only a suggestion.

489
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,788
Wait.

490
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,040
- Yes?
- Yes?

491
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,671
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

492
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,464
It was an accident.

493
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,301
Ariel? Where are you going?

494
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,096
Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff?

495
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,973
I'm going to see Ursula.

496
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,477
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

497
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,897
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

498
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,732
But... But I...

499
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,110
Come on!

500
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,919
- This way.
- This way.

501
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,108
Come in. Come in, my child.

502
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:26,363
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.

503
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,658
One might question your upbringing.

504
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,872
Now, then, you're here

505
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:40,002
because you have a thing
for this human, this prince fellow.

506
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:44,214
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

507
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,343
Well, angelfish,

508
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,638
the solution to your problem is simple.

509
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,434
The only way to get what you want

510
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,937
is to become a human yourself.

511
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,522
Can you do that?

512
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:07,112
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.

513
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,198
It's what I live for.

514
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:13,619
To help unfortunate merfolk, like yourself,

515
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:18,248

Now, here's the deal.

541
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,500
I will make you a potion that will turn
you into a human for three days.

542
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,211
Got that? Three days.

543
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,797
Now, listen, this is important.

544
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,550
Before the sun sets on the third day,

545
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:56,013
you've got to get
dear old princie to fall in love with you.

546
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,807
That is, he's got to kiss you.

547
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:04,521
Not just any kiss, the kiss of true love.

548
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:08,317
If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day,

549
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:12,112
you'll remain human permanently.

550
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:16,992
But if he doesn't, you'll turn back into a mermaid,

551
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,078
and you belong to me!

552
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,830
No, Ariel!

553
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,459
Have we got a deal?

554
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,003
If I become human,

555
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,589
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.

556
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,966
That's right!

557
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,969
But you'll have your man.

558
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,725
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?

559
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,689
And there is one more thing.

560
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,359
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.

561
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,653
You can't get something for nothing, you know.

- I'm not asking much.

563
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:59,451
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

564
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,954
What I want from you is

565
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,085
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweet cakes.

566
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,880
No more talking, singing. Zip!

567
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,966
But without my voice, how can I...

568
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,761
You'll have your looks, your pretty face.

569
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:23,350

No new seashells.

She traded her voice to the sea witch

I knew that.

Ariel's been turned into a human.

611
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,610
She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her,

612
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,862
and he's gotta kiss her.

613

614
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,702

615
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,622

I'll tell you what her father'd say.

00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,633
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what her father'd say!

619
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:27,552
I'm gonna march meself straight home right now

00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:33,475
And don't you shake your head at me, young lady.

If we could get that witch to give you back your voice,

624
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:42,192
you could go home with all the normal fish and just be...

Just be...

626

I'll try to help ya find that prince.

629
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:07,425
Boy, what a soft shell I'm turning out to be.

630
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,885
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.

631
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,262
If you wanna be a human,

632
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,472
the first thing ya gotta do is dress like one.

633
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:13,974
Now, let me see.

634
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,066
Max? What?

635
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,820
What? Max!

636
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,365
Ya look great, kid.

637
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,492
Ya look sensational.

638
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,256
Max!

639
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,595
Quiet, Max.

640
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,348
What's gotten into you, fella?

641
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,684
I see.

642
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,272
Are you okay, miss?

643
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,524
I'm sorry if this knucklehead scared you.

644
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,568
He's harmless, really...

645
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:13,700
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

646
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,371
We have met. I knew it.

647
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,624
You're the one, the one I've been looking for.

648
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,042
What's your name?

649
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,588
What's wrong? What is it?

650
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,133
You can't speak?

651
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:35,639
Then you couldn't be who I thought.

652
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,646
What is it? You're hurt?

653
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,357
No, no. You need help?

654
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,902
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.

655
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,156
Gee, you must have really been through something.

656
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,617
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.

657
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,369
Come on. Come on. You'll be okay.

658
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:08,088
Washed up from a shipwreck.

659
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,383
The poor thing.

660
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,594
We'll have you feeling better in no time.

661
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,434
I'll just... I'll just get this washed for you.

662
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,982
Well, you must have at least heard about this girl.

663
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,943
- No!
- Gertrude says...

664
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,278
When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?

665
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,281
- I mean, really.
- Madam, please...

666
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,117
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.

667
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,035
Not my idea of a princess.

668
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,829
If Eric's looking for a girl,

669
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:44,666
I know a couple of highly available ones right here.

670
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,055
Eric, be reasonable.

671
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,809
Nice young ladies just don't swim around rescuing people

672
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,394
in the middle of the ocean

673
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,354
and then flitter off into oblivion like some...

674
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,732
I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real.

675
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:12,610
I'm gonna find that girl, and I'm gonna marry her.

676
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,447
Come on, honey. Don't be shy.

677
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,957
Eric, isn't she a vision?

678
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,918
You look wonderful.

679
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,255
Come, come, come.
You must be famished.

680
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,424
Let me help you, my dear.

681
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,010
There we go. That's better.

682
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,596
Now, quite comfy? Good.

683
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,517
It's not often that we have such
a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

684
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,951
Do you like it? It is rather a fine one.

685
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,164
Oh, my.

686
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,415
Sorry, Grim.

687
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,045
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

688
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,464
Very amusing.

689
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,050
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?

690
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,343
You're gonna love it!

691
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:22,180

I think I'd better go see what Louis is up to.

722
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,696
Come out, you little pipsqueak, and fight like a man!

723
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,281
Louis!

724
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:50,078
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was just...

725
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,331
I'm sorry, madame.

726
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:59,212
You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy

727
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,673
seeing some of the sights of the kingdom.

728
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,508
Something in the way of a tour.

729
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,678
I'm sorry, Grim. What was that?

730
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,764
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.

731
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,141
Do something. Have a life.

732
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,644
- Get your mind off...
- Easy, Grim, easy.

733
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,313
It's not a bad idea, if she's interested.

734
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:18,982
Well, what do ya say?

735
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,025
Would you like to join me on
a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

736
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:27,156
Wonderful! Now, let's eat
before this crab wanders off my plate.

737
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,418
Come here, boy.

738
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,478
This has got to be, without a doubt,

739
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,773
the single most humiliating day of my life.

740
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:07,572
I hope that you appreciate
what I go through for you, young lady.

741
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:11,534
Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you.

742
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:16,998
Tomorrow when he takes you
for that ride, you gotta look your best.

743
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,918
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.

744
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,339
You gotta pucker up your lips, like this.

745
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:41,230
You are hopeless, child. You know that?

746
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,151
Completely hopeless.

747
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:55,953
Any sign of them?

748
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:59,040
No, Your Majesty.
We've searched everywhere.

749
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,293
We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian.

750
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,461
Well, keep looking.

751
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,672
Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored.

752
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:10,927
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

753
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,595
Yes, sire.

754
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,644
What have I done? What have I done?

755
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,378
Has he kissed her yet?

756
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,671
Not yet.

757
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,387
Judy!

758
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:14,031
Yo, Flounder! Any kissing?

759
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,576
No, not yet.

760
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,036
Well, they'd better get crackin'!

761
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,109
Move over. Move your big feathers.

762
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,986
I can't see a thing.

763
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:55,114
Nothing is happening.

764
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,244
Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once.

765
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:05,917
Okay. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.

766
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,669
Stand back!

767
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:20,139
Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.

768
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,899
Geez, man.
I'm surrounded by amateurs.

769

even for you.

904
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:12,976
Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain.

905

The daughter of the great sea king

906

is a very precious commodity.

907
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:22,861

908

Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!

911

933

So much for true love!

937
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:46,458
She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?

938
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:52,714
Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty,
