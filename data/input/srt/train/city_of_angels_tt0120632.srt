1
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,646
I don 't really pray...

2
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:40,731
...but if you could just
help me out here...

3
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:42,202
...I promise...

4
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,766
105.

5
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:48,687
105?

6
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:50,048
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:52,645
Run a bath, call the doctor.

8
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,844
Get her into the bath.

9
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,403
Dr. Carter, 655...

10
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:58,722
He won 't be there.

11
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:00,726
What is a thermometer?
Mercury.

12
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:04,326
How does it even work?
Maybe I can page him.

13
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:06,484
Susan. Susie.

14
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:09,121
Mommy says get up now.

15
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:11,051
- Cold.
- I know.

16
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:13,123
Hang on.

17
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:16,369
Cold!

18
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:19,127
It just feels cold because
you're so hot.

19
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:21,525
Susan, stay with me. Susan.

20
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:23,602
Susan!

21
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:28,491
Has she been disoriented?
Confused?

22
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:31,612
She said that she saw
a man in her bedroom.

23
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:36,449
Are you cold?

24
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:40,523
Okay, swing it.

25
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:43,371
- Move it, people.
- Is room 2 clear?

26
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:44,802
Yes, it's clear.

27
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,482
Get her pressure.

28
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:48,690
Let's give her O2. Ten liters.

29
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:50,885
Tap her right away.

30
00:01:58,573 --> 00:01:59,926
How's her breathing?

31
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:23,446
No pulse or rhythm.

32
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,325
Are you God?

33
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:29,008
No.

34
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:30,732
My name is Seth.

35
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:32,441
Where are we going?

36
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:33,688
Home.

37
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,607
Can Mommy come?

38
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:38,248
No.

39
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:48,484
She won't understand.

40
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:50,088
She will...

41
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:51,847
...someday.

42
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:01,449
Can I ask you something?

43
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:03,042
Yes.

44
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:05,484
What did you like best?

45
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:08,611
Pajamas.

46
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:35,484
She definitely knew what she liked.

47
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:39,565
- Pajamas?
- Flannel, with feet.

48
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:41,201
Pajamas.

49
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:44,362
Excellent choice. What else?

50
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:47,408
In the elevator of
the Bradbury Building...

51
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:50,884
...a man touched a woman's
bare skin by accident...

52
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:54,331
...but it made her turn
and look at him in such a way...

53
00:03:55,853 --> 00:03:57,332
And they...?

54
00:03:57,773 --> 00:03:58,967
Yes.

55
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,686
It was a good day.

56
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:04,369
Do you ever wonder
what that would be like?

57
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:05,843
Touch?

58
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,768
No.

59
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:09,768
Yes, you do.

60
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:13,931
Occasionally. Yes.

61
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:16,886
Touch.

62
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:37,166
I'm not asking for it every night.
Just twice a week.

63
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:40,007
Blue eyes.
He's never going to leave her.

64
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:43,848
20 minutes. 20 minutes. Everything
in this damn city is 20 minutes.

65
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:45,606
It's never 20 minutes.

66
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,122
My ass on a stool all day.
She always gets the good chair.

67
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:15,766
Six pounds, four ounces.
My daughter has a daughter.

68
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:30,169
$ 20,000 at 21 percent.

69
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,246
Pay it off with another card
at 14 percent.

70
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,602
Ah, shit!

71
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:39,085
Federal 595 heavy, slow immediately
to match preceding aircraft. Over.

72
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,210
Jesus, wake up! Wake up!

73
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,247
The little girl asked me
if she could be an angel.

74
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:00,732
They all want wings.

75
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,805
I never know what to say.

76
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,607
Tell them the truth.

77
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:06,806
Angels aren't human.

78
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,812
We were never human.

79
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,969
What if I just make her
a little pair of wings out of paper?

80
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:14,806
Tell her the truth.

81
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,732
I told her.

82
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:20,161
How did she take it?

83
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:25,132
She said, "What good would wings be
if you couldn't feel wind on your face?"

84
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:53,244
On the 101 through
downtown L.A., no delays...

85
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,171
Shit! Jesus!

86
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:03,522
What do we got?

87
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:07,932
50-year-old had a huge anterior wall MI
this morning. Collapsed while jogging.

88
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,173
Paramedics resuscitated him,
but his EKG's pretty ugly.

89
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:12,847
He's hypertensive.

90
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:14,327
This diagonal looks tight.

91
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,521
Who cathed him?

92
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,361
Rosenberg.

93
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,849
- Be right in.
- The patient wants to meet you.

94
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,729
He's pretty out of it.

95
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:39,572
The doctor's here.

96
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:04,364
We're just going to cool to 32 today.

97
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:07,083
Sucker.

98
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:11,402
Jimi.

99
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:27,843
Vein.

100
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,645
Kid started walking.

101
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,489
Three unassisted steps.

102
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,521
- Get it on video?
- I wasn't even there.

103
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:53,042
You failed as a father already.
How does that feel?

104
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:57,969
Retrograde on.

105
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:04,129
Come down to half flow,
give me a little volume.

106
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:06,011
Down to half flow,
here's your volume.

107
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:07,606
- Ready to come off?
- Ready.

108
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:08,763
Let's come off.

109
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,361
We're coming down.

110
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:13,650
We're clamped and off bypass.

111
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:37,848
Oh, shit.

112
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,488
What are you missing?

113
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:41,529
Sponge.

114
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,922
Bummer.

115
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:50,882
Got it!

116
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,086
Thank you, everybody.

117
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:00,171
Presbyterian's on line 2.

118
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:01,852
His rhythm will be irritable.

119
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:08,803
- She's getting good, huh?
- Yeah, she's getting that attitude too.

120
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,725
Getting an attitude?

121
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:14,372
Shit! V-tac!

122
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,007
Christ! Paddles!

123
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:18,165
Kill the music. Get her back.

124
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:20,404
- Charge to 2.
- Charging 200.

125
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:22,769
Dr. Rice.

126
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:30,289
Clear!

127
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:32,845
- No pressure.
- You give him lidocaine?

128
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:33,809
100's gone in.

129
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,332
Buzz him again at 300.

130
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,165
- Still nothing.
- Start compression.

131
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,243
Kill the alarm!

132
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:46,486
Hold up. It's not working.

133
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:49,048
Got to open him.
How long to go back on?

134
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:50,692
lt'll take me 10 minutes.

135
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:52,486
Come on! Nothing.

136
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:53,689
Knife.

137
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:03,849
Internal paddles. Charge to 20.

138
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:05,403
Ready.

139
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,809
Hit it.

140
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:10,327
Go to 30.

141
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:12,003
Hit it.

142
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:13,522
No response.

143
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,891
Tom, I got to get back on bypass here.

144
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:17,811
Almost there.
Give me 7 more minutes.

145
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:18,963
Come on.

146
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:22,928
Don't do this.

147
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:25,723
He's going.

148
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,402
He's not going anywhere.

149
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:39,045
Come on, don't do this!

150
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:42,927
Damn it, come on!

151
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,008
Tom!

152
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:49,126
Come on!

153
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:12,447
Mrs. Balford?

154
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:14,847
Where's the doctor?

155
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:18,409
- I'm the doctor.
- I'm sorry.

156
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:21,601
I operated on your husband.

157
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:23,441
How is he?

158
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:26,882
He didn't survive.

159
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:31,123
What?

160
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:36,007
We were able to restore
blood flow to the heart...

161
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:39,365
...but he developed a lethal arrhythmia
and we couldn't resuscitate him.

162
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:43,203
Wait. I'm sorry, I don't understand.
A what?

163
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:47,722
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,451
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

165
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:57,651
What did you say?

166
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:01,687
What?

167
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:04,207
Oh, my God!

168
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:35,407
On the table, on my table. I'm sorry.

169
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:37,126
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:41,769
I'm sorry. What happened?
What happened?

171
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,049
A graft occlusion? What?

172
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,527
It was textbook. It was textbook.

173
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,366
I'm so sorry.

174
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:00,725
The room got so big.
I was so small.

175
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,929
How did I get so small?

176
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:04,962
I should've gone back on.

177
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,563
I should've massaged longer.

178
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,811
I should've gone back on.
Massaged longer. I lost it.

179
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,612
I lost it.

180
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:34,604
Have you ever been seen, Cassiel?

181
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:36,889
You're looking at me.

182
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:41,526
No, not by me, and not
by the dying or the delirious.

183
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:43,845
Have you ever been seen...

184
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,451
...like you were a man?

185
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,725
In a diner once, a blind woman
turned to me all of a sudden...

186
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:53,850
...and asked me to pass her the mustard.

187
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:57,965
- But she was blind.
- But she knew I was there.

188
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:01,925
That doctor in the operating room...

189
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:05,490
...she looked right at me.

190
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,327
She didn't see you, Seth.
She can't see you.

191
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:10,922
No one can see you
unless you want them to.

192
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:13,052
And if I want her to?

193
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:15,528
Why do you want her to?

194
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:18,641
To help her.

195
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:20,488
Open it!

196
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,092
Open it now!

197
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:23,887
Everybody down!

198
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:27,611
Do it! Do it!

199
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:29,611
Shit! Just give him the money.

200
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,367
Did I leave the lights on?
I left the lights on.

201
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:34,445
I should have gone to Ralphs.

202
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,368
- Do it!
- Relax. I'm doing it, okay?

203
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,405
I never saw the Grand Canyon.

204
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:42,172
I'll never see my grandkids again.

205
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,326
What am I doing?

206
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:47,891
Just be cool. Be cool.

207
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:53,403
Be cool, man.

208
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:55,208
Be cool.

209
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,361
Holy shit!

210
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:05,172
They don't need to see us.

211
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,166
You're early.

212
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:58,002
What's going on?

213
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,971
Ferris was looking for you.

214
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:13,246
Don't I have a mitral valve to do?

215
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:15,011
They canceled it.

216
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:16,569
Who canceled it?

217
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:17,609
Sheffield.

218
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,247
Why are you telling me?

219
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:20,403
He was busy.

220
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:21,887
He was chickenshit.

221
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:23,970
- Maggie, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.

222
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:25,732
You're sick.
You can't operate.

223
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:28,527
They've rescheduled for Monday.
An elective valve, no big deal.

224
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:31,964
It is unprofessional, and it
embarrasses me in front of my staff.

225
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,051
I saw the chart on Balford.

226
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,245
I'm on the committee.
It's on review.

227
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,810
- It wasn't your fault.
- I know.

228
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:45,372
Then what's the problem?

229
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:50,681
I don't know.

230
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:53,764
You put up a terrific fight.

231
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:58,610
We fight for people's lives, right?

232
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,722
Don't you ever wonder who
it is we're fighting with?

233
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,651
So I'm crazy and chemically imbalanced.

234
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,406
You're tired.

235
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:13,966
You have moments.

236
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:16,888
Why didn't you call me?

237
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,484
Because I never sleep
when you stay over.

238
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,610
You never sleep whether
I stay over or not.

239
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:26,888
You're good.

240
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:28,407
You know it.

241
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:30,889
Come back Monday
and get back on the horse.

242
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,403
Doctor?

243
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:40,728
I'll see you.

244
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:07,729
"As I walk along the stony shore
of the pond in my shirtsleeves..."

245
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:10,527
"...Amazon basin in the north,
once an island sea..."

246
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:13,327
"The highest truth on the
subject remains unsaid...

247
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,365
...probably cannot be said.

248
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:19,572
For all that we say is the far-off
remembering of the intuition..."

249
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:23,449
"...she begins to pull away from
the awareness she had once..."

250
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,932
"Commencing search."
Searching my soul.

251
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,972
What happened to the cards?
You could touch the cards.

252
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,369
She's been looking
at me for half an hour.

253
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:36,972
Maybe if I just hang here...

254
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:41,121
"This is a delicious evening,
when the whole body's one sense..."

255
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:44,883
What if I screamed?
What if I just screamed right now?

256
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,002
"When a woman decides to sleep
with a man..."

257
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:53,452
"You knew there would always
be a spring...

258
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:57,965
...as you knew the river
would flow again after it was frozen.

259
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,803
When the cold rains kept on
and killed the spring...

260
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:06,485
...it was as though a young person
had died for no reason."

261
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:43,772
All right, they have rescheduled
the operation for Monday.

262
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,122
What happened yesterday?

263
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:47,006
They had a golf tournament.

264
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:48,692
Who knows with these people?

265
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,088
Good morning, Mr. Messinger.

266
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:52,842
The "G" is soft, like "messenger."

267
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,402
What's on your lip?

268
00:21:56,813 --> 00:21:59,043
What? Am I slobbering here?

269
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:06,481
- Where did you get that?
- What am I, a prisoner?

270
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:09,446
You want to get well, or
you want Ben & Jerry's?

271
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:11,166
This operation is a big deal.

272
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:13,246
Continue to eat like this...

273
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:16,368
...and you might as well skip it.
Save the 30 grand.

274
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:20,526
If you'd have performed the operation
yesterday like you were supposed to...

275
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:24,084
...I'd be sucking carrots through
a straw in my arm. What happened?

276
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:27,168
Circumstances were not optimal
for the procedure.

277
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:31,572
I ain't "the procedure." My name is
Nathan Messinger and I'm right here.

278
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:55,248
Hello, hello, hello...

279
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,526
Floating, floating. Don't pop it.
Don't pop it!

280
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:05,925
Do you know the Muffin Man,
the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man?

281
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:50,609
Hi, Anne.

282
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:52,252
What are you doing here?

283
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,451
I was on my way up to x-ray...

284
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:56,803
...and I thought I'd stop in and just...

285
00:24:57,933 --> 00:24:58,888
...hide.

286
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:00,848
From what?

287
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:04,452
I should've gone into pediatrics.

288
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:05,689
Oh, no.

289
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:08,567
Every guy you meet
is either married or a gyno.

290
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:11,611
Never date a man who knows more
about your vagina than you do.

291
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:16,245
Poor little guy.

292
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,205
He never stops crying.

293
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:24,569
- What's wrong with him?
- No insurance.

294
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:29,011
Found him in a dumpster
behind the House of Pies.

295
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:31,171
We worked him up the wazoo
for everything...

296
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:34,246
...from drug exposure to diabetes.
We got nothing.

297
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:36,482
May I?

298
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:50,201
Did you do an ultrasound?

299
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:52,205
- You hear a murmur?
- Worth a shot.

300
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:55,125
Okay, baby.

301
00:25:58,213 --> 00:26:00,852
So what are you hiding from?

302
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:04,531
My patient's wife.

303
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:08,371
She wants me to tell her that her
husband is going to be okay...

304
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:11,207
...and that I have every confidence...

305
00:26:12,013 --> 00:26:13,128
...and I don't.

306
00:26:13,493 --> 00:26:16,326
And after all this time,
and after all this work...

307
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:18,882
...I suddenly have this feeling that...

308
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,767
...none of this is in my hands.
Nothing.

309
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:25,287
And if it isn't...

310
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,091
...what do I do with that?

311
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:25,201
Excuse me.

312
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:34,252
Are you a visitor?

313
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:36,848
Yes.

314
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:40,533
Visiting hours have been
over since 8:00.

315
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:42,925
Why do they have that?

316
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,283
What?

317
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:45,608
Hours.

318
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,122
Doesn't it help the patient
to be visited?

319
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,284
Who are you visiting?
Mr. Messinger?

320
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:54,682
Right now?

321
00:27:58,773 --> 00:27:59,683
You.

322
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:05,092
I don't need a visitor.

323
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,448
You're not ill?

324
00:28:06,693 --> 00:28:07,603
No.

325
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:11,489
I'm one of the doctors here.

326
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:15,652
Are you in despair?

327
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:21,845
I lost a patient.

328
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:24,444
You did everything you could?

329
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:28,373
I was holding his heart
in my hand when he died.

330
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,091
Then he wasn't alone.

331
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:32,642
Yes, he was.

332
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:33,968
People die.

333
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,248
Not on my table.

334
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:37,882
People die when their bodies give out.

335
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:41,529
It's my job to keep their bodies from
giving out. Or what am I doing here?

336
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:43,570
It wasn't your fault, Maggie.

337
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:45,286
I wanted him to live.

338
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:46,886
He is living.

339
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:49,364
Just not the way you think.

340
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,691
I don't believe in that.

341
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:01,925
Some things are true
whether you believe in them or not.

342
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:05,086
How did you know my name?

343
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:10,441
What's yours?

344
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:13,522
Seth.

345
00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:23,371
You better get out of here, Seth...

346
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:26,207
...or security's going to think
you're a psych patient.

347
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:37,729
- Where are we?
- Down a liter.

348
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,083
Suction.

349
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:45,928
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

350
00:30:51,613 --> 00:30:55,970
No dying now, Mr. Messinger. Not until
you give me Seth 's phone number.

351
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:01,884
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

352
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:30,085
Those eyes.

353
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:32,684
The way he looked...

354
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:35,164
...right down into me.

355
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:38,407
Seth.

356
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:42,043
What kind of name is Seth?

357
00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:40,212
I thought you'd be here.

358
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:42,562
Salty.

359
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:45,402
My transplant tanked at 2 a.m.

360
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:48,087
You okay?

361
00:33:54,773 --> 00:33:56,570
You might want to return this.

362
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:04,128
That part about the spring?
"You knew there'd always be a spring."

363
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:06,565
How did you know that...?

364
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:08,889
What? I didn't give you this book.

365
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:13,803
You didn't?

366
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:15,482
Where'd you get it?

367
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:30,090
Hi. I'm a physician, and I think
a patient left that in my office.

368
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:33,211
- Can you tell me who checked it out?
- I can't tell you who.

369
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:35,330
I can tell you when.

370
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:38,371
All right, give me 5 minutes.

371
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,372
Hello, Maggie.

372
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,411
It's nice to see you again.

373
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,451
It's weird to see you again.

374
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:18,452
Weird is nice.

375
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:23,242
You like Hemingway?

376
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:26,451
Yeah, I'm starting to.

377
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:32,969
May I?

378
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:38,571
"As I ate the oysters with their
strong taste of the sea...

379
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:40,969
...and their faint metallic taste...

380
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:43,723
...as I drank their cold liquid
from each shell...

381
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:46,726
...and washed it down
with the crisp taste of the wine...

382
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:48,805
...I lost the empty feeling...

383
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:51,050
...and began to be happy."

384
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:54,242
He never forgets to describe
how things taste.

385
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:56,967
I like that.

386
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,410
Do you come here a lot?

387
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:03,281
I live here.

388
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:06,206
What do you do?

389
00:36:06,493 --> 00:36:07,403
Read.

390
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:09,848
No, I mean, your work.

391
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:12,452
I'm a messenger.

392
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:16,524
What kind of messenger?
A bike messenger?

393
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:19,282
No, I'm a messenger of God.

394
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,482
Got a message for me?

395
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:24,966
I already gave it to you.

396
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:29,092
Did you use my pager? I usually don't
get my messages unless you beep me.

397
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:33,324
You've definitely been beeped.

398
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,529
- How is Messinger?
- He's good.

399
00:36:37,853 --> 00:36:39,571
The operation went really well.

400
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:42,163
- It was a good day.
- It was.

401
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:44,643
Yeah, I didn't kill anybody today.

402
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:47,852
- You're an excellent doctor.
- How do you know?

403
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:49,802
I have a feeling.

404
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,243
That's pretty flimsy evidence.

405
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,168
Close your eyes.

406
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:58,372
It's just for a moment.

407
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:19,206
What am I doing?

408
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,483
You're touching me.

409
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:25,806
Touch.

410
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,561
How do you know?

411
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:31,645
Because I feel it.

412
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,651
You should trust that.

413
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,091
You don't trust it enough.

414
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:58,369
- Let's go somewhere.
- Where?

415
00:37:58,893 --> 00:37:59,803
I don't care.

416
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:02,201
What do you want to do?

417
00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:04,452
Anything.

418
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,651
What's that like?

419
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,925
What's it taste like?

420
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,965
Describe it. Like Hemingway.

421
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:00,004
Well, it tastes like...

422
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:02,167
...a pear.

423
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:04,963
You don't know what a pear tastes like?

424
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:08,167
I don't know what a pear
tastes like to you.

425
00:39:14,173 --> 00:39:15,492
Sweet...

426
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,127
...juicy.

427
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:21,406
Soft on your tongue.
Grainy...

428
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:24,526
...like sugary sand that
dissolves in your mouth.

429
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:29,401
How's that?

430
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:33,932
It's perfect.

431
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:55,010
The first time I looked in a microscope,
I knew I wanted to be a doctor.

432
00:39:58,253 --> 00:40:00,084
Okay, let me have your hand.

433
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:01,808
What for?

434
00:40:02,093 --> 00:40:03,765
We'll take a look at your blood.

435
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:06,445
Not a possibility.

436
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:10,808
Men.

437
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:13,283
I suppose you know a woman's
threshold of pain...

438
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,364
...is 9 times higher than a man's.

439
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:27,412
Take a look at that.

440
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:32,964
That's bright.

441
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:39,207
That's me.

442
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,367
All those cells.

443
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,405
That's all you are.

444
00:40:46,573 --> 00:40:48,803
That and all the space in between.

445
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:52,004
If this is all you are...

446
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:53,925
...these cells...

447
00:40:54,813 --> 00:40:56,963
...then when they die, that's the end.

448
00:40:58,213 --> 00:40:59,931
I don't know. I think so.

449
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:03,525
How do you explain it?

450
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:04,728
What?

451
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:08,443
The enduring myth of Heaven.

452
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:15,608
I used to think that I had it
all figured out.

453
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:16,922
But you didn't?

454
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,368
No.

455
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:27,361
Because something happened
in my O.R. and I got...

456
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:31,209
...this jolt. I got this feeling
that there's something...

457
00:41:31,653 --> 00:41:35,043
...bigger out there. Something bigger
than me, bigger than you, and it...

458
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:38,251
Does that sound crazy?

459
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:40,008
No.

460
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,927
I couldn't fix him.
I did everything right...

461
00:41:44,173 --> 00:41:45,845
...and I couldn't fix him.

462
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:48,691
That's not supposed to happen.

463
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,686
And I...

464
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:54,532
You cried.

465
00:41:57,653 --> 00:41:58,688
Yeah.

466
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:03,691
- Why do people cry?
- What do you mean?

467
00:42:04,373 --> 00:42:06,762
I mean, what happens physically?

468
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:13,849
Tear ducts operate on a normal basis
to lubricate and protect the eye.

469
00:42:14,093 --> 00:42:17,244
When you have an emotion,
they overact and create tears.

470
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,404
Why? Why do they overact?

471
00:42:22,093 --> 00:42:23,412
I don't know.

472
00:42:26,053 --> 00:42:27,964
Maybe emotion becomes so intense...

473
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,010
...your body just can't contain it.

474
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:33,768
Your mind and your feelings
become too powerful.

475
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:35,685
Your body weeps.

476
00:42:41,653 --> 00:42:42,688
I have to go.

477
00:42:42,973 --> 00:42:44,884
I got to go. Stay right here.

478
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:46,641
Don't go anywhere.

479
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:48,566
Stay right there.

480
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:10,172
- Get the tube out.
- He can't breathe.

481
00:43:10,453 --> 00:43:12,205
It's because the tube is blocked.

482
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:25,206
How you feeling?

483
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:27,330
Ready to hit the waves.

484
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:30,087
I'm afraid your bodysurfing
days are over.

485
00:43:32,573 --> 00:43:36,452
You got a mean tattoo going there.
What does your wife think of that?

486
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:39,365
That is my wife.

487
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,243
Check his vitals every 15.

488
00:44:06,733 --> 00:44:08,451
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

489
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:18,049
Go back and tell them
that I'm not going.

490
00:44:19,653 --> 00:44:21,052
Not yet.

491
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,206
Where have you been?

492
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:53,128
Oh, shit. I totally forgot dinner.

493
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:54,681
Dinner?

494
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:56,248
With who?

495
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:02,766
A guy I met. I bumped into him
and we got something to eat.

496
00:45:03,013 --> 00:45:04,526
Did you pack my backpack?

497
00:45:05,373 --> 00:45:06,647
What else?

498
00:45:07,893 --> 00:45:09,087
We talked...

499
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,403
...and then I got beeped
and he disappeared.

500
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:12,881
Why did you pack my backpack?

501
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:15,011
Earl, what are you doing?

502
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:17,813
I thought we'd fly up to Tahoe,
use your uncle's cabin...

503
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,321
...maybe do a little hiking.

504
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:21,848
What?

505
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:26,450
God. Is it...?

506
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:27,922
Maggie, it's just a tick.

507
00:45:28,413 --> 00:45:31,166
- Get a match.
- We're not going to burn him, Jordan.

508
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:33,244
It'll have to back out.
Can't leave the head in.

509
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:36,485
- We can't just be burning tick heads.
- Then get some alcohol.

510
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,563
I don't have any.

511
00:45:37,813 --> 00:45:39,963
- You don't have any alcohol?
- I don't operate here.

512
00:45:40,213 --> 00:45:41,646
How about some olive oil?

513
00:45:44,293 --> 00:45:45,806
Which kind? Jalapeño or rosemary?

514
00:45:46,653 --> 00:45:48,006
Rosemary.

515
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,728
So what did you and your friend...
What did you say his name was?

516
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:55,368
Seth.

517
00:45:55,613 --> 00:45:57,410
What did you two talk about?

518
00:45:59,053 --> 00:46:00,202
Dying.

519
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:06,088
Come on, we deal with life and death
every day. Why can't we talk about it?

520
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:09,246
I hope you won't become a
surgeon who prays in the O.R.

521
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:18,847
Can we talk for a minute?

522
00:46:19,093 --> 00:46:20,367
We'll talk while camping.

523
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,888
Jordan, I can't go camping now.

524
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:24,771
We need some time together.

525
00:46:25,813 --> 00:46:28,407
All right, let's see if we can
just spend 5 minutes.

526
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:31,725
Let's see if we can just stand
still together for 5 minutes.

527
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:33,449
Doing what?

528
00:46:33,893 --> 00:46:35,611
Just being here.

529
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:38,611
I'll get the trail map.

530
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:40,168
No, I mean it.

531
00:46:40,653 --> 00:46:41,881
Nothing but us.

532
00:46:45,213 --> 00:46:46,441
What do I do?

533
00:46:47,853 --> 00:46:49,172
Just look at me.

534
00:47:00,813 --> 00:47:01,848
You can't do it.

535
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:05,325
You can't do it.

536
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,087
- You flinched. You lose!
- You cheat.

537
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:24,965
That old black magic called...

538
00:47:25,213 --> 00:47:26,885
...love.

539
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:29,011
Thank you very much.

540
00:47:29,253 --> 00:47:32,768
Welcome back. We've been talking
to mothers who are members of the KKK.

541
00:47:34,973 --> 00:47:36,565
You want to watch anything?

542
00:47:40,133 --> 00:47:41,452
Me neither.

543
00:47:49,573 --> 00:47:51,404
How do you know when I'm here?

544
00:47:56,893 --> 00:47:58,121
I know.

545
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:01,766
Jeez, you look good.

546
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:06,124
I forgot how good everybody looked.

547
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,644
30 years of silence.

548
00:48:10,893 --> 00:48:14,488
You got guts, kid, showing yourself
like that. I appreciate that. I do.

549
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:16,007
It'll make it easier.

550
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:19,568
I got to tell you, I feel fine.

551
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,326
You might want to check your orders...

552
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:23,529
...because I sure don't feel
like I'm dying.

553
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:24,922
You're not dying.

554
00:48:25,173 --> 00:48:28,529
Right. Then how come you're
hanging around my room all the time?

555
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:30,968
I'm the only one with his ass
hanging out of his dress.

556
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:33,846
Unless...

557
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:38,805
Could it be...

558
00:48:39,853 --> 00:48:41,002
...the doctor?

559
00:48:42,573 --> 00:48:43,892
Sure.

560
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:45,612
The doctor.

561
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:48,091
She's pretty.

562
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,846
A little flat-chested...

563
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,765
...but all you need's a handful.

564
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:54,044
- Who are you?
- This is good.

565
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:56,529
This is what they call...

566
00:48:56,773 --> 00:48:58,843
..."serendipitous."

567
00:48:59,093 --> 00:49:02,324
Look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see a picture of you and me.

568
00:49:02,613 --> 00:49:03,762
Thank you.

569
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:12,165
You ready to deal?

570
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:15,326
Because I can answer all
your questions, friend.

571
00:49:24,893 --> 00:49:25,928
How's the French toast?

572
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:27,563
Fabulous.

573
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:28,882
Set me up.

574
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:39,044
Guess I should introduce myself.

575
00:49:39,773 --> 00:49:41,206
Come on, give me your hand.

576
00:49:42,933 --> 00:49:45,128
Put it in mine. There you go.

577
00:49:45,413 --> 00:49:47,324
A little tighter. Tighter.
There you go.

578
00:49:47,573 --> 00:49:48,926
No, that's too much.

579
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:51,323
There you go. Good grip.

580
00:49:52,373 --> 00:49:53,726
Nathaniel Messinger.

581
00:49:53,973 --> 00:49:55,691
Glutton, hedonist...

582
00:49:55,933 --> 00:50:00,085
...former celestial body,
recent addition to the human race.

583
00:50:03,813 --> 00:50:05,405
I don't believe you.

584
00:50:05,653 --> 00:50:06,881
You want proof?

585
00:50:07,373 --> 00:50:09,125
You hang out at a library.

586
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,965
You can speak every language.

587
00:50:11,293 --> 00:50:13,170
You travel with the speed of thought...

588
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:15,244
...and you're reading
my mind right now.

589
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:16,609
Stop that.

590
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:18,042
You're doing it.

591
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:20,802
It's impossible.

592
00:50:21,173 --> 00:50:24,165
"Some things are true
whether you believe them or not."

593
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:27,728
How?

594
00:50:28,413 --> 00:50:29,641
- You choose.
- Choose?

595
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,451
To fall to Earth.

596
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:34,526
You take the plunge,
the tumble, the dive.

597
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:36,729
You jump off a bridge.
Leap out a window.

598
00:50:36,973 --> 00:50:39,692
You just make up your mind
to do it and you do it.

599
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,731
You wake up all smelly,
and aching from head to toe...

600
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:47,645
...and hungrier than you've
ever been...

601
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:51,283
...only you have no idea what hunger is
or any of that stuff...

602
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:55,367
...so it's all real confusing
and painful, but very, very good.

603
00:50:57,973 --> 00:50:59,247
Human.

604
00:51:01,093 --> 00:51:02,208
Listen, kid:

605
00:51:03,613 --> 00:51:06,571
He gave these bozos
the greatest gift in the universe.

606
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,849
You think He didn't give it to us too?

607
00:51:09,173 --> 00:51:10,003
Which gift?

608
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,251
Free will, brother.

609
00:51:13,413 --> 00:51:14,892
Free will.

610
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:42,886
Couldn't get a job.

611
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:45,210
No past, no training.

612
00:51:45,453 --> 00:51:46,886
No I.D.

613
00:51:47,413 --> 00:51:50,883
Then one day, I was walking
past a building site.

614
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:52,486
A skyscraper.

615
00:51:52,733 --> 00:51:55,247
And I thought, "I could do that."

616
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:57,324
You see, these people down here...

617
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,485
...a lot of them are afraid of heights,
you know what I'm saying?

618
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:03,805
That makes me uniquely qualified.

619
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:07,968
And besides, it feels like
a little bit of home up here.

620
00:52:08,213 --> 00:52:09,441
And I like what I do.

621
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:10,802
I'm good at it.

622
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:15,449
These things'll kill you.

623
00:52:17,173 --> 00:52:18,401
Are there others?

624
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:20,646
Others like you?

625
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,446
Yeah, they're out there.

626
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:26,647
You see them, but most of the time
you just walk on by.

627
00:52:27,053 --> 00:52:30,602
Nobody likes to think of the old life.
You know, what they gave up.

628
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:32,766
Then why'd you do it?

629
00:52:41,853 --> 00:52:43,411
My daughter, Ruth...

630
00:52:43,653 --> 00:52:45,405
...her stupid husband, Frank...

631
00:52:46,013 --> 00:52:47,412
...and my grandkids.

632
00:52:47,653 --> 00:52:49,962
Petie's 4, Hannah's 6.

633
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,721
And this is my wife, Teresa.

634
00:52:58,933 --> 00:53:00,207
Did you...

635
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:02,691
...tell her who you were?

636
00:53:03,693 --> 00:53:06,161
I started to try once or twice.

637
00:53:06,573 --> 00:53:08,404
Then I thought, "Why do that to her?"

638
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:09,881
Do what?

639
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,171
It's too much for them.

640
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:15,688
People don't believe in us anymore.

641
00:53:24,853 --> 00:53:27,003
Do they still gather together
at sunrise?

642
00:53:27,573 --> 00:53:29,370
And sunset, yes.

643
00:53:30,653 --> 00:53:32,086
Take me there?

644
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,611
Can you hear it?

645
00:53:55,013 --> 00:53:56,002
No.

646
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:15,726
I can't hear that!

647
00:54:15,973 --> 00:54:18,248
But you can't feel this!

648
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:20,007
Nathan!

649
00:54:26,893 --> 00:54:28,121
You have to go back.

650
00:54:28,373 --> 00:54:30,409
Not until I catch the big wave.

651
00:54:34,573 --> 00:54:35,688
Wait.

652
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,402
Wait.

653
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:39,052
Wait for what?

654
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:41,242
Swim!

655
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,484
And then you just...

656
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:19,002
...fall.

657
00:55:19,573 --> 00:55:21,052
- Fall?
- Dive.

658
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:24,009
You make up your mind to do it...

659
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:26,406
...and you do it.

660
00:55:26,893 --> 00:55:29,088
And when you wake up, you're...?

661
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:31,052
Yes.

662
00:55:33,253 --> 00:55:35,050
To smell the air.

663
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:36,926
Taste water.

664
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:38,208
Read a newspaper.

665
00:55:38,453 --> 00:55:39,169
To lie.

666
00:55:39,453 --> 00:55:40,852
Through your teeth.

667
00:55:41,493 --> 00:55:42,403
To feed the dog.

668
00:55:45,253 --> 00:55:46,527
Touch her hair.

669
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:50,452
What are you waiting for?

670
00:55:55,813 --> 00:55:58,247
There is so much beauty up here.

671
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:01,241
Yes.

672
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:26,482
Here you are again.

673
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:29,765
We'll release your friend
Messinger tomorrow.

674
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,168
That's good.

675
00:56:31,413 --> 00:56:34,644
His family's having a kind
of a welcome-home party.

676
00:56:37,653 --> 00:56:39,052
Will you be going?

677
00:56:39,573 --> 00:56:40,972
Will you be going?

678
00:56:43,693 --> 00:56:44,603
This is Earl.

679
00:56:44,893 --> 00:56:46,121
He told me.

680
00:56:47,213 --> 00:56:48,362
What else does he tell you?

681
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:52,401
He worries that you never sleep.
And he loves to see you smile.

682
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:56,045
Sometimes I think Earl's the
only one who understands me.

683
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:57,328
What about your boyfriend?

684
00:56:57,893 --> 00:56:59,167
Do you love him?

685
00:57:02,053 --> 00:57:03,327
Love? I don't know.

686
00:57:03,573 --> 00:57:04,847
What does that mean?

687
00:57:05,733 --> 00:57:07,724
I was hoping you could tell me.

688
00:57:08,653 --> 00:57:10,689
It's a word...

689
00:57:10,933 --> 00:57:13,493
...that describes a chemical react...

690
00:57:15,013 --> 00:57:17,573
It's just crap. I'm full of crap.

691
00:57:19,413 --> 00:57:22,644
I wait all day, just hoping
for one more minute with you...

692
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:24,372
...and I don't even know you.

693
00:57:24,973 --> 00:57:26,565
What do you want to know?

694
00:57:28,493 --> 00:57:30,165
Why you wear the same
clothes all the time.

695
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:32,563
Why won't you give me
your phone number?

696
00:57:33,613 --> 00:57:34,728
Are you married?

697
00:57:35,413 --> 00:57:36,402
No.

698
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,208
Are you homeless?

699
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:40,768
No.

700
00:57:41,853 --> 00:57:42,968
Are you a drummer?

701
00:57:47,693 --> 00:57:49,604
Why don't you ever touch me?

702
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:55,051
I don't want to hurt you.

703
00:57:57,453 --> 00:57:58,886
You won't hurt me.

704
00:58:22,893 --> 00:58:24,212
Did you feel that?

705
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:39,363
If I could make you understand...

706
00:58:42,453 --> 00:58:43,886
I understand.

707
00:58:48,493 --> 00:58:50,051
I'll see you around.

708
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:53,482
Hey, Doc!

709
00:59:56,173 --> 00:59:58,767
No, give me the whole package.
Come here.

710
00:59:59,653 --> 01:00:01,086
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

711
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,607
You look great.

712
01:00:04,373 --> 01:00:05,249
Is this heaven?

713
01:00:05,653 --> 01:00:06,847
Look at this.

714
01:00:11,253 --> 01:00:12,971
Come on, let's meet some people.

715
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:14,772
You got an appetite?

716
01:00:19,173 --> 01:00:20,526
Have a beer, Seth.

717
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:22,288
Where you from?

718
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:24,403
Up.

719
01:00:24,653 --> 01:00:26,723
North. Uh, Canada.

720
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:35,092
Listen. Can you hear?

721
01:00:36,013 --> 01:00:37,412
I'm growing.

722
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:38,969
Smile, Hannah.

723
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:49,652
How long have you known Seth?

724
01:00:51,573 --> 01:00:52,801
Not very long.

725
01:00:54,253 --> 01:00:56,448
But I feel like I've known him forever.

726
01:00:57,493 --> 01:00:59,404
Honey, that hurts.

727
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:03,091
You're just like Grandpa.

728
01:01:05,093 --> 01:01:06,208
Come on.

729
01:01:06,853 --> 01:01:08,127
Let's see if the cookies are done.

730
01:01:08,613 --> 01:01:09,602
Come on, Seth.

731
01:01:09,853 --> 01:01:11,969
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, great.

732
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:18,361
How did you two meet?

733
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,686
He works with me over at the site.
Construction work.

734
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:24,807
I thought he was a messenger.

735
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:27,889
Yeah, he's one of those...

736
01:01:28,133 --> 01:01:29,043
..."hyphenates."

737
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:31,207
I'll be right back.

738
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:10,846
Here, can you cut this up?

739
01:02:18,413 --> 01:02:20,802
So in what province in Canada
were you born?

740
01:02:21,773 --> 01:02:23,491
I wasn't born in Canada.

741
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:29,161
What are your parents' names?

742
01:02:37,373 --> 01:02:38,647
No parents.

743
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:48,486
You have very delicate hands
for a construction worker.

744
01:02:48,813 --> 01:02:50,166
I'm not a construction worker.

745
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:52,569
Very pale hands. Let me see.

746
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:58,648
- Why did you do that?
- Let me see your hand.

747
01:02:58,933 --> 01:02:59,763
No.

748
01:03:01,813 --> 01:03:02,768
What's your last name?

749
01:03:03,053 --> 01:03:04,122
You know my last name.

750
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,528
I don't.

751
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:08,722
Plate.

752
01:03:09,533 --> 01:03:10,522
Seth Plate?

753
01:03:17,013 --> 01:03:18,492
I cut you.

754
01:03:20,373 --> 01:03:21,692
I cut you.

755
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:27,641
I cut you with that knife.
I felt it go in. You felt it.

756
01:03:28,613 --> 01:03:29,887
Not the way you do.

757
01:03:31,413 --> 01:03:32,892
The way I do?
What does that mean?

758
01:03:33,173 --> 01:03:36,609
You mean the way a doctor does?
The way a woman does? What?

759
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:38,167
The way...

760
01:03:39,413 --> 01:03:40,323
...a human does.

761
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:44,126
I have no sense of touch.

762
01:03:45,493 --> 01:03:46,243
You feel that?

763
01:03:46,773 --> 01:03:48,172
Don't be frightened.

764
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,648
You freak!

765
01:03:49,933 --> 01:03:51,002
You liar!

766
01:03:51,573 --> 01:03:53,245
Who... What are you?

767
01:03:53,653 --> 01:03:55,086
I came to take Mr. Balford...

768
01:03:56,413 --> 01:03:57,892
...and I saw you.

769
01:03:59,853 --> 01:04:02,003
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

770
01:04:02,813 --> 01:04:04,565
How you fought for him.

771
01:04:06,573 --> 01:04:08,404
And you looked right at me...

772
01:04:09,013 --> 01:04:10,651
...like I was a man.

773
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:13,966
- "To take Mr. Balford"?
- I was there.

774
01:04:14,253 --> 01:04:18,007
- We're always there in every room.
- What are you talking about?

775
01:04:18,493 --> 01:04:19,926
I was there in the stairwell...

776
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:22,769
...when you cried for your patient.

777
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,368
And I touched you. Remember?

778
01:04:27,413 --> 01:04:28,892
Why are you doing this?

779
01:04:30,253 --> 01:04:31,891
Because I'm in love with you.

780
01:04:39,613 --> 01:04:41,092
I don't believe you.

781
01:04:42,013 --> 01:04:43,366
Do you feel that?

782
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:47,532
You don't want to believe me.

783
01:04:48,173 --> 01:04:50,050
I cannot conceive of it!

784
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,366
Just get out!

785
01:04:54,453 --> 01:04:55,772
Get out!

786
01:05:43,933 --> 01:05:44,922
Doctor?

787
01:05:47,853 --> 01:05:48,888
Doctor?

788
01:06:33,933 --> 01:06:35,002
Hello?

789
01:06:41,773 --> 01:06:42,762
Seth?

790
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:47,527
Are you here?

791
01:07:42,093 --> 01:07:43,811
I want to see you.

792
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:47,971
Let me see you.

793
01:08:16,453 --> 01:08:17,852
Just stay.

794
01:08:20,653 --> 01:08:22,769
Just stay until I fall asleep.

795
01:08:58,453 --> 01:09:00,125
Oh, yes!

796
01:09:02,933 --> 01:09:04,207
Thank you.

797
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:26,611
The baby can't sleep.

798
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,971
Has anyone ever seen the baby sleep?

799
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:31,528
I don't know. Let's check him out.

800
01:09:40,813 --> 01:09:41,928
Choanal atresia.

801
01:09:42,173 --> 01:09:44,403
There's hardly any air getting through.

802
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:46,009
How did you know?

803
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:49,366
I just...

804
01:09:51,093 --> 01:09:52,048
...knew!

805
01:10:16,973 --> 01:10:17,962
Maggie?

806
01:10:18,613 --> 01:10:19,568
Yeah.

807
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:20,922
Are you alone?

808
01:10:21,773 --> 01:10:22,728
Yeah.

809
01:10:26,653 --> 01:10:28,928
Pretty intuitive call on the baby.

810
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,482
Think so?

811
01:10:31,893 --> 01:10:32,962
I couldn't have done it better.

812
01:10:34,373 --> 01:10:35,806
Well, that's a compliment.

813
01:10:50,253 --> 01:10:51,732
What are you doing?

814
01:10:52,053 --> 01:10:53,452
I'm spending time with you.

815
01:10:56,213 --> 01:10:57,566
Will you marry me?

816
01:10:58,573 --> 01:11:00,370
We can finally get up to Tahoe.

817
01:11:00,693 --> 01:11:02,092
Get married on the Nevada side...

818
01:11:02,413 --> 01:11:04,369
...honeymoon and be back
before we miss a case.

819
01:11:06,533 --> 01:11:08,922
What do you want me to do?
Get down on my knees?

820
01:11:09,573 --> 01:11:10,767
What do you want me to say?

821
01:11:11,733 --> 01:11:13,325
We belong together.

822
01:11:13,893 --> 01:11:15,485
We're the same species.

823
01:11:21,813 --> 01:11:25,123
I'm not very good at matters
of the heart. I mean...

824
01:11:25,733 --> 01:11:27,405
...the proverbial heart.

825
01:11:30,573 --> 01:11:32,006
Please be my wife.

826
01:11:36,373 --> 01:11:37,488
Just think about it.

827
01:11:52,573 --> 01:11:53,688
Breathe in.

828
01:11:57,493 --> 01:11:58,528
Breathe in.

829
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:12,568
I'm good.

830
01:12:20,173 --> 01:12:24,644
I don't understand a God who would let
us meet, if we could never be together.

831
01:12:28,133 --> 01:12:29,122
He didn't tell you.

832
01:12:33,213 --> 01:12:34,123
Tell me what?

833
01:12:34,773 --> 01:12:36,001
Maybe you should ask him.

834
01:12:36,733 --> 01:12:38,371
No, I'm asking you.

835
01:12:49,413 --> 01:12:51,085
Seth knows no fear...

836
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:52,607
...no pain...

837
01:12:52,893 --> 01:12:54,372
...no hunger.

838
01:12:55,493 --> 01:12:57,768
He hears music in the sunrise.

839
01:13:00,013 --> 01:13:01,731
But he'd give it all up.

840
01:13:02,013 --> 01:13:03,446
He loves you that much.

841
01:13:06,093 --> 01:13:07,731
I don't understand.

842
01:13:10,693 --> 01:13:12,126
He can fall.

843
01:13:12,773 --> 01:13:15,333
He can give up his existence
as he knows it.

844
01:13:15,613 --> 01:13:18,525
He can give up eternity and become...

845
01:13:18,813 --> 01:13:19,928
...one of us.

846
01:13:20,733 --> 01:13:22,007
It's up to you.

847
01:13:23,893 --> 01:13:25,406
How do you know this?

848
01:13:31,093 --> 01:13:32,606
Because I did it.

849
01:14:08,613 --> 01:14:10,444
Seth, I need to talk to you.

850
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:16,564
Seth, please.

851
01:14:19,533 --> 01:14:20,522
Please be here.

852
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:24,644
God, help me through this.

853
01:14:35,573 --> 01:14:37,131
You are so beautiful.

854
01:14:39,773 --> 01:14:41,445
You'll always be that way.

855
01:14:44,853 --> 01:14:46,650
Jordan asked me to go away with him...

856
01:14:46,933 --> 01:14:48,252
...and get married.

857
01:14:51,013 --> 01:14:52,366
He knows me.

858
01:14:53,693 --> 01:14:55,604
He knows the demands of my work.

859
01:14:56,173 --> 01:14:57,845
You don't love him.

860
01:14:59,013 --> 01:15:00,526
He and I are the same.

861
01:15:03,053 --> 01:15:04,406
And I want that.

862
01:15:08,013 --> 01:15:11,688
And I want somebody who can
feel my hand when I touch him.

863
01:15:13,373 --> 01:15:14,931
But you can feel me.

864
01:15:15,213 --> 01:15:16,805
You felt me.

865
01:15:18,493 --> 01:15:20,131
I want to say goodbye.

866
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:24,005
I don't want to see you again.

867
01:19:15,653 --> 01:19:16,972
Hey, buddy.

868
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:19,332
You can't be in here.

869
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:21,128
Do you see me?

870
01:19:22,973 --> 01:19:24,452
Do you see me?

871
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,212
Can you see me?

872
01:19:26,533 --> 01:19:27,602
We can see you.

873
01:19:29,493 --> 01:19:30,846
Is this blood?

874
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:31,963
This is blood!

875
01:19:32,373 --> 01:19:33,488
Is it red?

876
01:19:34,013 --> 01:19:34,889
Red?

877
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,482
Is it red?

878
01:19:37,853 --> 01:19:39,252
Color.

879
01:19:39,573 --> 01:19:41,529
What color were the drugs you took?

880
01:19:42,813 --> 01:19:44,087
Better get your butt out of here.

881
01:19:44,973 --> 01:19:46,042
You got somewhere to go?

882
01:19:49,853 --> 01:19:51,002
Maggie.

883
01:20:02,733 --> 01:20:05,452
Down and down and down I go

884
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:07,849
Round and round and round I go

885
01:20:08,573 --> 01:20:10,131
Round and spin

886
01:20:10,413 --> 01:20:12,449
Loving the spin I'm in

887
01:20:12,773 --> 01:20:15,162
Loving that old black magic...

888
01:20:15,453 --> 01:20:17,330
...called love

889
01:20:18,773 --> 01:20:20,570
Love!

890
01:20:21,853 --> 01:20:22,968
Hi!

891
01:20:32,533 --> 01:20:35,730
I was wondering if you could tell me
how to get to the county hospital?

892
01:21:18,053 --> 01:21:19,168
Can I help you, sir?

893
01:21:19,413 --> 01:21:22,086
I'll just take a moment
to catch my breath.

894
01:21:23,093 --> 01:21:23,889
Breath!

895
01:21:27,253 --> 01:21:28,242
Maggie Rice.

896
01:21:29,933 --> 01:21:31,048
Are you a patient?

897
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:32,966
No. I just need to find her, please.

898
01:21:33,373 --> 01:21:35,603
You'll have to call her office.
Someone there can help you.

899
01:21:36,253 --> 01:21:37,402
Do you know where she is?

900
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:40,004
No, sir, I do not know where she is.

901
01:21:43,253 --> 01:21:44,811
You have this computer...

902
01:21:46,133 --> 01:21:48,089
...and all this technology.
Can't you look her up?

903
01:21:51,813 --> 01:21:52,962
Where's Maggie?

904
01:21:58,133 --> 01:21:59,725
So you're a friend of Maggie's?

905
01:22:01,813 --> 01:22:03,007
What happened to you?

906
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:04,243
Sorry.

907
01:22:04,693 --> 01:22:05,762
It's okay.

908
01:22:08,773 --> 01:22:09,922
I fell.

909
01:22:10,413 --> 01:22:12,973
Evidently. Off a train?

910
01:22:13,893 --> 01:22:15,406
I fell in love.

911
01:22:22,493 --> 01:22:24,006
Please help me find her.

912
01:22:29,013 --> 01:22:32,210
She went to Lake Tahoe. Her uncle
has a cabin on the Nevada side.

913
01:22:32,533 --> 01:22:33,488
Wait!

914
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:04,962
Cassiel.

915
01:23:05,893 --> 01:23:07,042
Are you there?

916
01:23:15,693 --> 01:23:16,569
Hello.

917
01:24:09,533 --> 01:24:10,727
Where you headed?

918
01:24:12,373 --> 01:24:13,203
Tahoe!

919
01:24:14,573 --> 01:24:15,722
Reno!

920
01:24:16,053 --> 01:24:17,088
Tahoe!

921
01:24:17,733 --> 01:24:19,007
I'm going to Reno.

922
01:24:19,373 --> 01:24:20,726
I'm going to Tahoe.

923
01:24:21,253 --> 01:24:23,562
Hop in. We'll figure it out
when we get there.

924
01:26:35,213 --> 01:26:36,692
Am I too late?

925
01:26:38,373 --> 01:26:39,328
Too late?

926
01:26:40,213 --> 01:26:41,282
Jordan?

927
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,205
I couldn't marry Jordan.

928
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:52,005
I'm in love with you.

929
01:26:59,853 --> 01:27:01,127
What happened?

930
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:05,772
Free will.

931
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:21,766
I feel you.

932
01:28:37,613 --> 01:28:39,012
Do you feel that?

933
01:28:39,373 --> 01:28:40,408
Yes.

934
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:43,561
And that?

935
01:28:47,493 --> 01:28:50,166
How's it feel?
Tell me what it feels like.

936
01:28:51,173 --> 01:28:52,447
I can't.

937
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:55,323
Try.

938
01:28:57,133 --> 01:28:58,248
Warm.

939
01:29:03,493 --> 01:29:04,721
Aching.

940
01:29:22,133 --> 01:29:23,327
It's okay.

941
01:29:26,053 --> 01:29:27,168
We fit together.

942
01:29:27,533 --> 01:29:28,488
I know.

943
01:29:29,253 --> 01:29:31,209
We were made to fit together.

944
01:29:51,893 --> 01:29:54,771
I always asked the dying what
they liked best about living.

945
01:29:57,373 --> 01:29:59,045
Wrote it down in my book.

946
01:30:01,493 --> 01:30:02,608
This is it.

947
01:30:04,173 --> 01:30:05,811
This is what I like best.

948
01:30:06,773 --> 01:30:08,809
You haven't even started yet.

949
01:30:09,573 --> 01:30:11,882
We have our whole lives together.

950
01:30:12,213 --> 01:30:13,362
You and me.

951
01:30:13,613 --> 01:30:15,490
Mr. and Mrs. Plate.

952
01:35:38,253 --> 01:35:40,130
- I'll get help.
- You're here.

953
01:35:40,813 --> 01:35:42,246
- Stay.
- I should get help.

954
01:35:42,493 --> 01:35:44,449
Don't go. The driver went.

955
01:35:44,693 --> 01:35:45,921
Please stay.

956
01:35:46,253 --> 01:35:48,050
Please stay with me.

957
01:35:48,813 --> 01:35:50,212
I'm scared.

958
01:35:54,733 --> 01:35:56,166
I screwed up.

959
01:35:57,533 --> 01:35:59,330
I wanted to show you everything.

960
01:35:59,773 --> 01:36:00,922
You will.

961
01:36:04,453 --> 01:36:07,047
You came all this way.

962
01:36:08,373 --> 01:36:09,806
I'm sorry.

963
01:36:10,853 --> 01:36:12,730
God, no, Maggie!

964
01:36:13,773 --> 01:36:15,047
To touch you...

965
01:36:15,293 --> 01:36:16,442
...and to feel you.

966
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:20,211
To be able to hold your hand right now.

967
01:36:20,613 --> 01:36:21,728
You know what that means?

968
01:36:21,973 --> 01:36:24,533
Do you know how much I love you?

969
01:36:28,893 --> 01:36:30,884
Keep looking at me, okay?

970
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,125
Look right in my eyes.

971
01:36:36,013 --> 01:36:37,651
Someone's out there.

972
01:36:39,573 --> 01:36:42,849
Don't look at them.
Please don't you look at them!

973
01:36:43,093 --> 01:36:44,572
Is this what happens?

974
01:36:51,413 --> 01:36:52,368
Yes.

975
01:36:58,613 --> 01:37:00,251
This is what happens.

976
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:06,251
I'm not afraid.

977
01:37:10,173 --> 01:37:11,765
When they ask me...

978
01:37:13,773 --> 01:37:15,092
...what I liked the best...

979
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:18,448
...I'll tell them...

980
01:37:18,773 --> 01:37:20,172
...it was you.

981
01:37:49,093 --> 01:37:50,128
God!

982
01:39:48,653 --> 01:39:51,042
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

983
01:39:53,493 --> 01:39:54,608
I'm sorry.

984
01:39:58,253 --> 01:39:59,402
Get out.

985
01:40:01,933 --> 01:40:04,401
Was it you? Were you the one?
Were you there?

986
01:40:04,973 --> 01:40:05,849
No.

987
01:40:07,053 --> 01:40:08,202
Why did He do this?

988
01:40:08,493 --> 01:40:09,448
I don't know.

989
01:40:09,693 --> 01:40:10,808
Because her number was up?

990
01:40:11,973 --> 01:40:13,531
What do you want me to say?

991
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:24,010
- Am I being punished?
- You know better than that.

992
01:40:25,613 --> 01:40:27,171
That's life.

993
01:40:28,893 --> 01:40:30,008
You're living now.

994
01:40:31,853 --> 01:40:32,808
And one day...

995
01:40:33,453 --> 01:40:34,727
...you'll be dying.

996
01:40:41,253 --> 01:40:42,242
What's it like?

997
01:40:43,533 --> 01:40:44,409
What?

998
01:40:45,493 --> 01:40:46,448
Warmth.

999
01:40:48,653 --> 01:40:49,972
It's wonderful.

1000
01:40:52,013 --> 01:40:54,083
If you'd known this
was going to happen...

1001
01:40:55,733 --> 01:40:56,961
...would you have done it?

1002
01:41:02,853 --> 01:41:04,730
I would rather have had...

1003
01:41:06,413 --> 01:41:08,210
...one breath of her hair...

1004
01:41:11,813 --> 01:41:13,531
...one kiss of her mouth...

1005
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,449
...one touch of her hand...

1006
01:41:20,573 --> 01:41:22,643
...than an eternity without it.

1007
01:41:25,613 --> 01:41:26,602
One.
