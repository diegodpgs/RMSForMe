1
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,680
OK.

2
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,403
Honey?

3
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,146
David, could we just
sit in the courtyard for a minute?

4
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,212
Just a minute?

5
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,891
Sure.

6
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,852
Mommy?

7
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,884
What, sweetie?

8
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,724
Where's my room gonna be?

9
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,691
I thought we'd share a room for a while.

10
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,030
Would you like that?

11
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,132
My old room, from when I was a kid.

12
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,872
You need to go back to sleep.
You have a big day tomorrow.

13
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,132
You doing OK, Jules?

14
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,406
We're almost there, sweetie.
Come on.

15
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,817
Mommy?

16
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,421
I don't wanna go out there.

17
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,928
- It's OK, honey. I promise.
- I'm scared.

18
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,075
What if I hid you?

19
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,144
Would that be OK?

20
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,656
Like on my shoulder,
under my coat?

21
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,821
- The whole way?
- Yeah, the whole way.

22
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,990
- What kind of food do they have?
- On the airplane?

23
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,228
In America. Grandma and Grandpa.

24
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,926
The best.

25
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,770
- Do they have toast?
- Of course.

26
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,533
<i>Welcome to Berlin</i>
<i>International Airport.</i>

27

<i>Do not leave your luggage unattended.</i>

28

Julia?

31
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,046
Julia?

32
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,212
Julia, how many times
do I have to tell you

33
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,656
not to wander away from me
in public places?

34
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,354
- How many times?
- I was hungry.

35
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:01,025
Honey, it doesn't matter.
You scared me to...

36
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:06,461
- Look, you really worried me.
- Sorry.

37
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,400
OK.

38
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,534
What kind of snack do you want?

39
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,577
You want this one?

40
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,753
- It's so big.
- It's the biggest.

41
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,188
What kind is it, Mom?

42
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:29,353
It's an E-474. It's brand new.

43
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,988
Did you make it?

44
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,625
See those huge engines?
Mommy helps make 'em work.

45
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,967
Those men could fall.

46
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,913
Don't worry, honey.
They're not gonna fall.

47
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,074
But they could.

48
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,141
<i>Aalto Flight 9583.</i>

49
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,382
<i>Passengers with small children,</i>
<i>please proceed to Gate...</i>

50
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,652
OK, that's us. Ready?

51
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,462
- Can I hold my own ticket?
- Sure.

52
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,593
You carry it
until we get on the plane, OK?

53
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,298
26, and on the right-hand side.

54
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,303
Yeah. There we go. Right here.

55
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,511
<i>Welcome to Aalto Airlines.</i>

56
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:16,157
- Stop. Wait, stop. No pushing.
- It didn't even hit me.

57
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,862
Stop it.

58
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,930
- Can we have our candy?
- No candy on this flight.

59
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,440
I'm holding onto it.

60
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,410
Here we go.
All right, so we're row 25.

61
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,743
Do you see what's going on
with your kids?

62
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,248
How will we work this out?
Guys, stop.

63
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,911
Dad. Why does she get everything
all the time?

64
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,820
- We like her more.
- We want you to calm down, OK?

65
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,881
Calm down.

66
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,950
Enjoy your flight.

67
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,196
- Hi. Welcome aboard. Right this way.
- Thank you.

68
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,613
Guys.

69
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,788
Excuse me. Ma'am?

70
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:26,362
I've got two questions for you.
What are the movies?

71
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:30,966
And how loud do these headphones go?

72
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,868
Never quite loud enough?

73
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,972
I wish you guys
would do that with bricks.

74
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,244
That way it would end faster.

75
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,049
Those empty seats in the back
are starting to look pretty attractive.

76
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,648
Thank you. Guys, stop it.

77
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,261
- Hi, Stephanie.
- Hey, Bill.

78
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,423
Could be some high maintenance
in row 25.

79
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,523
I heard 'em.

80
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,228
I think the people two planes away
heard them.

81
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,238
Tell the new kid
it's OK to laugh about the passengers.

82
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,501
It's OK to hate the passengers.

83
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,476
They've just shut down Frankfurt.

84
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,138
Thank God we aren't going to Frankfurt.

85
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,205
We may not be going anywhere.

86
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:30,932
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we apologize for the delay this evening.</i>

87
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,096
<i>We should be taking off shortly.</i>

88
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,243
Bob, what was that?

89
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,785
I don't know.
It's nothing to worry about.

90
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:55,089
They have to nick the ice off or the
air won't pass over the wing properly.

91
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,013
You just sleep, honey.

92
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,020
And when you wake up,
we'll be somewhere else.

93
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,047
We'll be in New York.

94
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,917
Daddy, too?

95
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,522
Yeah.

96
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,856
Daddy, too.

97
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,208
I love this part.

98
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,921
You OK?
Do you want me to get the steward?

99
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,040
How'd you like a whole row to yourself?

100
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,637
Last couple of rows are empty.

101
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,375
We could take a few seats
and we could stretch out.

102
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,075
Would you like that?

103
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,669
Honey, I fell asleep.

104
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,294
Are you watching this movie?

105
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,798
No.

106
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,866
Not too funny.

107
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,811
Course at 36,000ft you can't just
up and walk out of the theater.

108
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,817
- Did you see a little girl go by here?
- No, sure didn't.

109
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,877
My daughter...

110
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:21,048
- How long have we been flying?
- Three hours. Maybe a little more.

111
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,224
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

112
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,097
- There's a girl in the lounge.
- Thank you.

113
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,935
No, she's six, my daughter.

114
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,807
You probably saw us.
I was carrying her aboard.

115
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,306
Of course. Yes.

116
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,010
She hasn't been up here. Sorry.

117
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,085
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

118
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,029
She has sandy hair in a ponytail.

119
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,798
She's probably carrying a chenille bear
with one arm.

120
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,040
She probably just found
a couple of kids to play with.

121
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,052
Two Bloody Marys.

122
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,736
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Excuse me.

123
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,196
Excuse me.

124
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,903
Would you mind using the other aisle?

125
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:23,641
- I'm just looking for my daughter.
- Well, she can't have gone too far.

126
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,706
Fine, I'll go around.

127
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,848
- Your juice.
- Thank you.

128
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,161
Pardon me.

129
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,663
Shit.

130
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,705
- Is something wrong?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

131
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,540
Have you seen her walking by or...

132
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,047
I don't think so.
How old is she?

133
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:41,058
- She's six.
- No, I never saw her.

134
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,830
Can I help you, ma'am?

135
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,065
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

136
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,903
It seems our aircraft
is big enough to lose a child in.

137
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,965
Her name is Julia Pratt.

138
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,308
<i>She's six years old</i>
<i>and wearing a navy blue jumper.</i>

139
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,440
<i>If she's near you</i>
<i>or playing with one of your kids,</i>

140
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,507
<i>please press the call button.</i>

141
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:10,316
<i>We've got an anxious mom up here.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

142
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,367
All children
should have to wear a cowbell.

143
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,038
Someone must've seen her.

144
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,175
Any takers?

145
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,223
We've got to search the plane.
I don't know how to organize that.

146
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,520
Miss Pratt,
I am sure she's perfectly OK.

147
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,581
No.

148
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,819
No, she's not.

149
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:56,231
She's been through something.
She's not herself right now.

150
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:01,598
- Can we get the seat-belt signs on?
- We're getting ahead of ourselves.

151
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:05,302
There's nine closets on this plane.
There's four up and five down.

152
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,902
And nobody's checked any of them.

153
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,004
There's galleys, crew quarters.

154
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,778
There's the holds.
Kids can find places like that.

155
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:18,585
I just need the aisles clear
so I can look, OK?

156
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,350
OK.

157
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,191
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go back to your seat.

158
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,028
But I tell you what. I will personally
go and speak to the captain

159
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:35,300
and see if he can step away
from the flight deck. All right?

160
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,320
Are you in the airline business?

161
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,690
You seem to know aircraft design.

162
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,523
Yeah, I'm a propulsion engineer.
I work for Elgin Air.

163
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,224
I mean, I just left.

164
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,492
Based in Berlin?

165
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,362
Look, I know
you're just trying to keep me calm.

166
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,874
But the problem is not that I'm anxious.

167
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:15,470
The problem is my daughter is missing
and nobody can tell me where she is.

168
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,408
I'm sorry.

169
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,553
Do you have any kids?

170
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:32,222
- Do nieces count?
- Yeah, almost.

171
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,732
They hate playing hide and seek
with me because I always find them.

172
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,463
So, fear not.

173
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,404
Did you guys see my little girl?

174
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,510
You're the one
they made the announcement about?

175
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,522
I didn't even know
you had a kid with you. Did you?

176
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,581
Sorry, I didn't.

177
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,752
Maybe you could help me look for her.

178
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,057
- Cool.
- Awesome. I'm so bored.

179
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,897
Sorry, no.

180
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,230
- Why not?
- Dad, she's lost.

181
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:14,763
How lost can she be?
We're in a tube.

182
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,665
Turn around.

183
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,342
I'm sure the captain
will be here any minute.

184
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,477
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

185
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,357
Engineer?

186
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,361
Yeah.

187
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,962
You the one who came up
with the five-across seating?

188
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,136
- Miss Pratt.
- What's wrong?

189
00:26:56,214 --> 00:27:00,241
- Who's she talking to?
- We'll get to the bottom of this.

190
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:05,051
Is she all right? Did something
happen to her? She's hurt.

191
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,647
OK.

192
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,058
Do you know where my daughter is?
What aren't you telling me?

193
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,688
What aren't you telling me?
Say it.

194
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:21,129
Miss Pratt, I'm sorry
but I don't think that she's here.

195
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,107
- What?
- We don't...

196
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:29,108
Ma'am, we don't have any record of your
daughter ever having been on board.

197
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,775
What are you talking about?

198
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:39,154
The departure gate say they never
checked a Julia Pratt onto this plane.

199
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,418
Of course they did.

200
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,627
She was right next to me.

201
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,167
We were the first two passengers
on the plane.

202
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,703
We must have walked right past you.

203
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:56,502
Ma'am, this is our passenger manifest.
Your daughter isn't on it.

204
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,374
We walked right past you.

205
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:04,548
Row 26.
I put her in the seat next to me, 26A.

206
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:09,451
The manifest lists 26A as unoccupied
and I did the headcount myself.

207
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:14,356
So you missed one. What does that
have to do with finding her now?

208
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,856
- You want to see her boarding pass?
- If you wouldn't mind.

209
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,730
I put it right in my pocket.

210
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,511
I put both boarding passes in my pocket.

211
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,579
Her backpack's missing.

212
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,691
She couldn't have reached up there
by herself. She's not tall enough.

213
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,395
- Somebody has her.
- That's quite an assumption.

214
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,926
How else could her stuff disappear?
Can you think of another way?

215
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:03,565
- I have to talk to the captain.
- I can't guarantee that he'll see you.

216
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,769
People do things to little girls.
Sick things. You know that.

217
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,143
I need to talk to the captain.

218
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,948
- Get back to your seat.
- Someone has my daughter.

219
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,152
Captain, I need to speak to you.

220
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,696
You're a threat
to the safety of this aircraft.

221
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,792
- I'm not a threat.
- I'm an air marshal. Can I let you go?

222
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:32,992
Yes.

223
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,078
Gene Carson. Are you hurt?

224
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,579
- I just need to see the captain.
- I understand.

225
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,640
But that's his call, not yours.

226
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,849
All clear, captain.

227
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,223
The departure gate had no record of her?

228
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,286
No, sir. I had them double check.

229
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:04,227
- And there's no boarding pass.
- There was but it was taken from me.

230
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,336
You were working the entry door,
is that right?

231
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,505
- Yes, captain.
- Did you see the girl?

232
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,572
I don't...

233
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,418
I don't remember either way, sir.

234
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,014
Sir, I did the count myself.
26A was empty.

235
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,591
- Did you tell him about the bear?
- The bear?

236
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,828
It was under her blanket. She wouldn't
have walked away without it.

237
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:43,204
Have you had anything to drink on this
flight? Anything alcoholic at all?

238
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:44,263
No.

239
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,742
Are you under any medication?

240
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,715
I have sleeping pills with me just like
every other passenger on board.

241
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,880
And I'm carrying Klonopin.

242
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,422
For anxiety.
I took two this morning.

243
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,523
I see. How long have you been on them?

244
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,463
- I'm not on them.
- How long?

245
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,858
I filled the prescription a week ago.

246
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,895
When my husband died.

247
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:20,372
My daughter and I are bringing his body
back to Long Island for burial.

248
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:26,042
There is a casket in the hold, sir,
from Kaiser Wilhelm Hospital.

249
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:31,020
He fell six days ago
from the roof of our building.

250
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:43,098
Does anybody on board
remember seeing her?

251
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,864
- Passengers in her row?
- No one has said so, sir.

252
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,738
There are 32 children on the manifest.
They've all been accounted for.

253
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,015
You were seated near her, Mr. Carson.
Isn't that right?

254
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,449
- That's right.
- Did you see her?

255
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,981
No. I didn't.

256
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,587
Think about what you're suggesting,
captain.

257
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,359
That I imagined
bringing her on board

258
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,923
and that I'm now
pretending to look for her.

259
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,732
Does that make any sense? Can you
think of a reason why I would do that?

260
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,639
I'm not drunk, I'm not loaded,
I'm not looking for attention.

261
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,473
There are protocols about these things.

262
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:32,278
If a pilot has an inaccurate passenger
manifest, he must land the plane.

263
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,877
A teddy bear does not constitute
an inaccurate passenger manifest.

264
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:40,084
I'm telling you it's inaccurate. That
means you have to search the plane,

265
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:44,026
just like you would if
it was your own child that was missing.

266
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,788
Julia's only six years old.

267
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:51,426
She's not in good shape right now.
She's scared of everything.

268
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,938
I had to put her under my coat today
just to get her in the car.

269
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:02,304
But she did get in that car. She got on
this plane like every other person here.

270
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,112
And I fell asleep.

271
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:09,882
Which I should never have done.
But she was right next to me.

272
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,589
I was holding her hand when we took off.

273
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,155
Please...

274
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,488
You've got to help her.

275
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,341
Get the lights up.

276
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,877
Get every passenger seated.
No one in the toilets. No exception.

277
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,150
Look for her backpack,
her boarding pass.

278
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,216
Check every closet, every bin.

279
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,422
Are there any more questions?

280
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,488
Thank you.

281
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,806
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we apologize for the inconvenience</i>

282
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:13,010
<i>but the captain requests that</i>
<i>all passengers return to their seats.</i>

283
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,552
We'll turn off
the seat-belt sign in a minute.

284
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,522
Can you fasten that seat belt,
please, ma'am? Thank you.

285
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,052
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

286
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,726
It's not like she lost her Palm Pilot.

287
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,842
A six-year-old girl
climbing into avionics?

288
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,478
This is really silly.

289
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,788
- This is procedure.
- Captain.

290
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,225
Thanks.

291
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,200
Anybody in here?

292
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,670
Hello?

293
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,729
Miss?

294
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,899
Miss. I need to use the rest room.

295
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,276
As soon as the captain's
turned off the seat-belt sign, sir.

296
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,338
I don't need an escort.

297
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,883
I'm responsible for any threat

298
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:57,148
- to the safety of this flight.
- This is absurd.

299
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:00,486
Women with imaginary children qualify.

300
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,387
Sir, you'll have to return to your seat.

301
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,192
- My back gets stiff...
- I'm sorry.

302
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,859
All passengers
must remain in their seats.

303
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,925
I know.

304
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,028
Running out of magazines up here.

305
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:21,069
Tell me something.
What are you gonna do when we find her?

306
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,136
How are you gonna explain yourself?

307
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:27,810
It's not so bad if she's lost.
Because then you just look lazy.

308
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:34,257
But if somebody took her,
if a crime was committed on this flight,

309
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:38,056
and the law enforcement official
on board didn't do anything about it,

310
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,120
how's that gonna look?

311
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,189
You made your point.

312
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,859
- Katerina.
- What?

313
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,418
- Have a look.
- Why? Did you see something?

314
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:16,728
No. It's just that I'm dying
to watch you crawl through that hatch.

315
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,171
What's the problem?

316
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,549
May I help you?

317
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,747
Do I know you from somewhere?

318
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,189
You've walked past me five times
since we took off.

319
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,250
Does that count?

320
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,922
- Are you from Berlin?
- Am I being interrogated now?

321
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:51,992
- I asked you if you're from Berlin.
- No. I am not.

322
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,061
Let's go.

323
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,897
What was that all about?

324
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,285
Think about what you're saying no to.
It would be epic.

325
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,346
You're terrible.

326
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,092
My daughter.
You were looking for my daughter.

327
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,226
I need to speak to the captain again.

328
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,171
Can you get him
on the phone for me, please?

329
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,997
OK. Can we look in the holds now?

330
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,378
There is no way a child could have
gained access to any of the holds.

331
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,678
There's access to the forward holds
from galley number two.

332
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,379
- The call button's too high for...
- So was the overhead bin.

333
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,548
- She's with an adult. I told you...
- What adult?

334
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:51,527
- Every passenger is in his seat.
- The passenger manifest is inaccurate.

335
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,393
You've got to search the holds now.

336
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,957
I'm sorry, Miss Pratt.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

337
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,463
- Excuse me.
- Godammit, are you listening?

338
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,739
Wait.

339
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,610
- I don't think it's such a bad idea.
- What?

340
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,309
It might be good
to have her below deck for a while.

341
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:18,048
She is making the passengers anxious.
Obviously I would go down with her.

342
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:22,889
Mr. Carson, I am responsible for the
safety of every passenger on this plane.

343
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,987
Even the delusional ones and I will not
have a passenger out of her seat

344
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:30,090
bouncing around
with the luggage bins in the holds.

345
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:34,900
Any turbulence and you could be injured.
And so could you, Mr. Carson.

346
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:42,910
Now, we're going to continue to search
this aircraft from the waist upwards.

347
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:48,475
If we don't find anybody, I will send
two members of my crew into the holds.

348
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,316
I just saw two members of your crew

349
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,825
and they did everything
except look for my daughter.

350
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,919
Miss Pratt,
there are 425 passengers on this flight

351
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,692
who are not receiving any attention
at the moment

352
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:05,395
because every one of my flight
attendants are looking for a child

353
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:08,165
that none of them believe
was ever on board.

354
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,606
If you think we could be doing more
to meet your needs,

355
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,702
then I suggest you take it up
with customer service after we land.

356
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,408
Captain,
can I speak to you for a moment?

357
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,380
Mr. Carson,
this woman is in your charge.

358
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,289
I want her to remain
in the passenger cabin.

359
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,553
Is that understood?

360
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,618
Understood.

361
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,753
Do excuse me.

362
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,655
I know where I've seen him before.

363
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,704
I know where I've seen him before.

364
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,838
I know where I've seen you before.

365
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:58,250
- What?
- Where's my daughter?

366
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,018
You were looking
through her window last night.

367
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,390
I saw you staring
into my daughter's room. Both of them.

368
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,589
- You are a lunatic.
- Where's Julia?

369
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:10,327
Hold it. Back up.
Have you seen these men before?

370
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,926
- Yes.
- No. She has not.

371
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:16,700
I saw them last night
staring into my daughter's room.

372
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,000
Is this correct, sir?

373
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,808
- I've never seen this woman before.
- Neither have I.

374
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,179
What do you expect them to say,
"You got me"?

375
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,983
- Shouldn't we move this to a galley?
- Why? I didn't do anything.

376
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,885
I've never even seen this woman before.

377
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:37,291
- Where'd you take my little girl?
- Aren't you listening?

378
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,352
I have never seen her.

379
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,062
I don't trust 'em.

380
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,401
Not that it's any of your concern,

381
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:57,038
but I was at the Hilton last night
on business.

382
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,811
We both were.
And neither of us left the hotel.

383
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,778
Would you like to see our bill?

384
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,315
It's a bit unorthodox but...

385
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,360
...if you wouldn't mind.

386
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:29,743
When I travel with my children,
I have an eye on them at all times.

387
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,841
I don't lose them
and blame somebody else.

388
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,172
- Satisfied?
- A bill doesn't prove anything.

389
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:58,967
Satisfied?

390
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,944
Are you gonna let him
talk to you like that?

391
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,712
- Let's go.
- Where's my daughter?

392
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:13,086
I spent the night watching a movie,
you crazy...

393
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,255
- Come here.
- Where's my daughter?

394
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,852
Get a handle on this lady, will ya?

395
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,990
It's OK. I'm OK.

396
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,057
Is that the lady with the kid?

397
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:29,599
Anyone else have any questions for me?

398
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,046
Then you'll have to find
a few other Arabs to harass.

399
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:40,083
- Sonofabitch.
- We're gonna take our seats now.

400
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,085
All of us. Right?

401
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:51,787
- I can cuff you, understand that?
- Why would you want to cuff me?

402
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:55,263
Sorry. Got a seventy-year-old
who couldn't hold his pee any longer.

403
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,334
Mine's six, almost wet himself.

404
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:01,599
OK. You think those men
were surveilling you last night

405
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,004
for the purposes
of kidnapping your daughter

406
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,770
- and stashing her until we land?
- Yes.

407
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,108
Mind if I ask you
an obvious question?

408
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:12,273
If they knew where you lived,
why not take her from there?

409
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:15,147
Why take her on an airplane
with no means of escape?

410
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:18,188
- I don't know.
- And let's not forget,

411
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:22,521
her name isn't on the manifest.
How could two passengers pull that off?

412
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,528
They'd have to have
somebody from the crew involved.

413
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,585
Jesus.

414
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,459
Think about what you're asking me to do.

415
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:35,494
Approach two Arabs on an airplane
and accuse them of criminal conspiracy.

416
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,541
I don't give a shit
about being politically incorrect.

417
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:42,875
Fine, let's arrest them, just as soon
as you answer one more question.

418
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:46,143
Why would anyone
want to take your daughter?

419
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:50,152
What makes her so special?
What makes you so special?

420
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:59,719
I know the plane.
That's what this is all about.

421
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:03,790
- Why they picked me.
- They picked you? For what?

422
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:08,736
I think they're hijacking the plane.
I think my daughter's a hostage.

423
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:12,367
Your husband's death is starting
to make a lot more sense to me.

424
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,469
A couple more hours
and even I'm ready to jump.

425
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,208
He fell.

426
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,914
- David fell.
- Sure he did.

427
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:30,419
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the captain's</i>
<i>turned off the seat-belt sign.</i>

428
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,122
<i>- You are now free to...</i>
- What's he doing?

429
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,724
What's he doing?

430
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,874
Excuse me.

431
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,720
What are you doing?
Are we done looking?

432
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,317
- Just come with me.
- I'm not going anywhere.

433
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,487
We're not going to discuss this here.

434
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,588
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

435
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,190
She's dead, godammit.

436
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,496
You found her.

437
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,839
No, I didn't find her, Miss Pratt.

438
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:37,084
This is from Kaiser Wilhelm Hospital.

439
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:42,053
That's where your husband
was pronounced dead. Is that correct?

440
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:45,861
Yes.

441
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,134
Your daughter was also taken there.

442
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,709
No. She wasn't there when it happened.
She was with the nanny.

443
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:58,043
Miss Pratt, according to the director
at the morgue there

444
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:01,915
your daughter Julia
died of internal injuries

445
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,545
at 2.36pm.

446
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,847
He took her with him off the roof.

447
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,983
Didn't he?

448
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,159
No. Julia wasn't even there.

449
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,896
She was at the park.

450
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,927
She was at the park.

451
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,995
She wasn't even there.

452
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,265
She wasn't even there.

453
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,281
You're crazy. You're all crazy.

454
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:42,714
- She was never on board.
- No. I carried her on board.

455
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:47,230
Miss Pratt,
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

456
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,288
She must be so scared.

457
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:55,168
But my main responsibility
is the safety of these passengers

458
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:00,302
and I can't allow anyone, no matter
how tragic their circumstances,

459
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,336
- to jeopardize that.
- She doesn't know where she is.

460
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,683
Our air marshal is going
to escort you back to your seat.

461
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,914
Mr. Carson,

462
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,916
would you take her back to her seat now?

463
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,571
What's she doing?

464
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,630
Stop her.

465
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,701
Grab her.

466
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,329
How are you feeling?

467
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,933
Are you in pain?

468
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,940
We can get you some aspirin if you want.

469
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:14,849
Kids, turn around. Turn around.

470
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,877
Turn around.

471
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,763
The captain thought
you might want to talk with me.

472
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,359
I'm a therapist.

473
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,529
My seat's just a few rows up.

474
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,832
And I asked if I might be able to help.

475
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,906
I don't know you.

476
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,849
So many of my patients
come to me after a loss.

477
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,944
To grieve.

478
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,855
Sometimes it's just stopping.

479
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,689
Allowing the pain to come.

480
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,465
Your husband, David...

481
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,069
...can you tell me about him?

482
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,004
I don't know you.

483
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,142
Was he very unhappy?

484
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:31,917
Yes.

485
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:36,525
He was unhappy.

486
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,926
I didn't know.

487
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,504
He didn't talk about it like that.

488
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,301
I understand.

489
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:59,718
Last night
I walked through the city

490
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,083
and he was with me.

491
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:09,560
- He was there.
- Was Julia there, too?

492
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:10,622
No.

493
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,563
She was waiting for me at home.

494
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:18,675
She was happy to see you?

495
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:23,503
She said she couldn't sleep.

496
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:28,545
So I got into bed with her.

497
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,545
And lay there

498
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:36,883
until she closed her eyes.

499
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:45,730
When something's too
overwhelming, too painful,

500
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,765
we deny it.

501
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,831
We choose to believe something else.

502
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:56,869
So you can walk with David and

503
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:00,242
get on a plane with Julia.

504
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,477
It feels better than the truth.

505
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,249
So much better.

506
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,054
Yes, of course.

507
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,802
But it's impossible to move on
if we haven't accepted,

508
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,674
if we haven't grieved.

509
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,143
Sometimes it helps to think of an image.

510
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,946
You could imagine your husband
and daughter on an island.

511
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,117
A beautiful place.

512
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:49,893
They'll always be there. And you can
swim to them any time you need to.

513
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,184
Do you understand?

514
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,295
Am I allowed to go to the rest room?

515
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,044
I just need to be alone.

516
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,707
I don't know where else to go.

517
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,680
This is a very good idea.

518
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,885
She needs a moment on her own.

519
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,927
Is she any kind of threat to herself?

520
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,493
No. Of course not.

521
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:05,303
- Should we take her belt and shoelaces?
- No, she's going to be fine.

522
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,100
She's going to be fine.

523
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,536
Aren't you?

524
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:14,140
You're going to be fine.

525
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,985
Excuse me.

526
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:40,902
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

527
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,969
Sure.

528
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:54,613
I'll be waiting right here.

529
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,894
I'll be right out.

530
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:11,363
All right, place the mask
over your nose and mouth.

531
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,895
Breathe normally.

532
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,528
They're tangled up.

533
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,301
Sir, please take your seat.

534
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,477
- I don't wanna die.
- Attention. There is no need to panic.

535
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:28,541
Place the mask over your nose and mouth
and use the straps to tighten it.

536
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,069
Stay calm.

537
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,410
No way.

538
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:05,146
OK. Stay back in your seat.

539
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,997
Stay in your seat, ma'am.
Thank you.

540
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,897
What did you do to the lights?

541
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:39,879
Get your hands off me.

542
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,559
Where is she?

543
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:48,155
You don't need a mask.
We haven't lost pressure. Where is she?

544
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:02,667
Julia?

545
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,696
Julia? Are you in there?

546
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,732
I'm right here, baby. Hold on.

547
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:43,245
Just wait. Mommy's here, baby.

548
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:54,846
No...

549
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,362
David...

550
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:05,456
Honey...

551
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:12,233
I'm so scared, honey.

552
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:18,145
I can't find her.
I can't find our baby.

553
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,341
I don't know where she is.

554
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:23,978
But no one will help me.

555
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:26,045
No one can help me.

556
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:30,693
They didn't even see her.

557
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,751
Turn around.

558
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,824
Don't...

559
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,762
I'm not done looking yet.

560
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,637
Yeah, you are. Let's go.

561
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,905
What's he doing?
There's two hours left.

562
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,606
We're descending.

563
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,049
That's what pilots do when there's
an out-of-control passenger on board.

564
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:59,054
Fine. The sooner we land,
the sooner we can clear the airplane

565
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,851
and I can keep searching.

566
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:05,054
- I haven't checked in the attics yet.
- They've already been searched.

567
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,119
I haven't searched them.

568
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:14,133
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we have begun to descend now.</i>

569
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,866
<i>We are going to be making</i>
<i>an unscheduled stop...</i>

570
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,665
<i>We'd like to apologize for any delay.</i>

571
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,770
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

572
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:26,472
Here she comes.

573
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:34,155
How come
there's only one coffin down there?

574
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:38,888
If my daughter had died with my husband,
I'd be flying two coffins home.

575
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:41,055
Wouldn't I?

576
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:43,827
You know what?
I don't know... and I don't care.

577
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,630
You just scared the shit
out of 400 passengers

578
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,501
who didn't plan
to spend the night in Newfoundland.

579
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:53,440
My daughter's alive. You know she's
alive. You know she's on this plane.

580
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,668
Why didn't anybody see her?

581
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:02,585
Please. There's not that many places
left to search.

582
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,348
I just need
the plane deboarded when we land.

583
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:09,055
You're gonna be arrested when we land.

584
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,094
Gonna hold onto her this time?

585
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,841
About time.

586
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,372
If you let them arrest me,

587
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,432
she's gone for ever.

588
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,907
There'll be no one to save her.

589
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,215
Please...

590
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,148
I'm begging you.

591
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,173
Ma'am.

592
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,743
Sir.

593
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,790
I need to talk to the captain.
Can you sit here?

594
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,956
- We're descending. All passengers...
- I'm sorry. It's a security matter.

595
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,022
She won't be any trouble.

596
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,616
Are you hurt?

597
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:33,317
No.

598
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,256
Did you eat anything?

599
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,061
What part of the plane did you search?

600
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,902
I'm sorry?

601
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,306
When we had the crew search
for my daughter?

602
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,569
Where were you?

603
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,673
I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

604
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:34,177
- What does she want?
- $50 million.

605
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,241
Transferred into that account.

606
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,345
Or they blow up the plane.

607
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:43,180
They?

608
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:46,228
She has an accomplice on board.
She won't say who it is.

609
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:49,162
But...
that's who's holding the detonator.

610
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:53,066
The plane's to be deboarded on the
tarmac, passengers first, then crew.

611
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:56,037
And they want a G3.
Fuelled and waiting.

612
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,869
So all that searching
for the girl was just a...

613
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:03,139
She's disturbed. She used her husband's
coffin to get explosives on board.

614
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:05,942
And as for the little girl,
I don't know.

615
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,212
Maybe she killed them both.

616
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:16,289
- I want to speak to her.
- She doesn't want that.

617
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:18,554
No approaches
by any member of the crew.

618
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:21,594
Now, listen.

619
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:22,995
Listen.

620
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:28,565
I don't get the feeling
she wants to hurt anyone.

621
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:34,270
I've never heard of a hijacker
letting passengers deboard before.

622
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:38,939
My recommendation is you ask
the airline to wire the money,

623
01:08:39,015 --> 01:08:41,779
notify me when the transfer's been made.

624
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,475
OK?

625
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,156
Let's keep her thinking
she's in control.

626
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:51,455
We'll land, get everyone deboarded,

627
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:55,489
then we take her down.

628
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,499
Mr. Carson?

629
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,406
- What are you doing?
- I am not sitting back there.

630
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:15,008
- Gene, she knows.
- What does she know?

631
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:19,214
She knows the kid's in avionics,
she knows that I'm a part of this.

632
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:21,984
- Did she say anything about avionics?
- No.

633
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:24,549
- Did you?
- No.

634
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:29,155
Then why are you panicking? Everything's
working out how we wanted it to.

635
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:32,827
She has half the plane believing
we have Arab terrorists on board.

636
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:36,269
- It's priceless.
- She's putting things together, Gene.

637
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:40,139
What difference does it make? She'll
be dead ten minutes after we land.

638
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:43,372
They'll find her
with a bullet hole through her head.

639
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:46,142
And a detonator in her hand.

640
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:50,276
Hasn't this all been explained to you
a thousand times?

641
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:54,813
The only piece of evidence that matters
is about this high.

642
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:58,622
Her name is Julia
and she is gonna get vaporized.

643
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,593
Now it is all working.
Get it together.

644
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,634
OK, look.
If something goes wrong when we land...

645
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:17,577
Mr. Carson?
The captain would like you to call him.

646
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:19,638
Thank you.

647
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,411
Yes, captain.

648
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:29,981
<i>The money's been wired.</i>
<i>I have confirmation. Do you have a pen?</i>

649
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,050
I do.

650
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,323
Go ahead.

651
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:40,529
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the captain</i>
<i>has turned on the seat-belt sign</i>

652
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:42,594
<i>as we prepare for our final descent.</i>

653
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:45,641
<i>Please return your seat</i>
<i>to its upright position.</i>

654
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,869
Thank you. I can handle it from here.

655
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:57,285
I don't understand.

656
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:59,651
Cuffs are for people who pose a threat.

657
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:00,916
Right?

658
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:08,656
We're putting down in Goose Bay,
Newfoundland. The F.B.I.'s en route.

659
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,327
I've notified them that
we have a missing person situation.

660
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:19,038
They'll clear the plane
and every passenger on board

661
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,474
will be detained and questioned.

662
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:25,913
Two agents will come on board
and help us look for her.

663
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:28,450
What about the crew?

664
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,815
Will they be detained and questioned?

665
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:36,218
You've no idea how happy I'm gonna be
to hand this case over.

666
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,684
Thank you.

667
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,902
Where the hell are we?

668
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,912
Sit back.

669
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:04,845
<i>All units, the suspect will be escorted</i>
<i>off the plane by a flight marshal.</i>

670
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:08,042
<i>Confirm. Victor One</i>
<i>standing by to provide transport.</i>

671
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,581
Just keep quiet.
You don't want to antagonize anybody.

672
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:18,559
These people already expect
you to be arrested by now.

673
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:28,827
Touch me again, you're dead.

674
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:33,197
Touch.

675
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,142
Go. Move.

676
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,073
Shut up.

677
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,425
OK.

678
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:04,462
The crew's gonna deboard now.

679
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:08,304
Another couple of minutes,
the plane will be all yours.

680
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,679
- Where are you going?
- I need to talk to him.

681
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:15,080
Make sure
nothing gets taken off the plane.

682
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:19,315
No food carts, no trash cans.
It's important the plane stays sealed.

683
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:22,380
Well, I don't really have the option
to say no.

684
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,151
Do I?

685
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,596
OK, let's sit down.

686
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,465
Captain.

687
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:51,009
All set for deboarding?

688
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:56,824
Captain, look. I know I broke the law
and disrupted your flight.

689
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,292
But in a few minutes,
we'll find my daughter...

690
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:04,958
- The crew can deboard now.
- And you're gonna owe her an apology.

691
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:07,729
Enough.

692
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:11,705
Miss Pratt, your money has been wired
just as you asked.

693
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:15,505
A G3 is waiting, just as you asked.

694
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,970
Perhaps we can do without the pretense
of the missing child now.

695
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:21,277
What?

696
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,148
- Wait here. I'll get them.
- Get who?

697
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,550
The agents. Wait here.

698
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,315
<i>Subject is zero 50 meters.</i>

699
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,294
Carson.

700
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,227
You get off the plane
when I say you get off the plane.

701
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,029
You want to play?
Let's play.

702
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,095
I want my daughter.

703
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,733
Deboard the crew
and we'll talk about it.

704
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:59,270
Or you can go back there
and tell them I'm the hijacker.

705
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,373
And maybe they'll believe you.

706
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,214
Maybe I'll tell them
what you've got in your pocket.

707
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,881
Go ahead. The first one to go
will be your daughter.

708
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:48,859
- Will that be all?
- No.

709
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,489
Give him your gun.

710
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,015
- God speed, Mr. Carson.
- Thank you, captain.

711
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,854
I think you and I need to talk.

712
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:24,558
Me, too.

713
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,118
Where is she?

714
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,854
Where'd you put her?

715
01:18:59,802 --> 01:19:02,737
She's in avionics, isn't she?
Isn't she?

716
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,441
Stay here.

717
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:51,713
Listen, it's over.

718
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,156
Nobody is coming to help you.

719
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:59,717
You're the crazy lady.
So why don't you just come out of there?

720
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,620
Nobody has to die.

721
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:06,223
My husband
didn't jump off that building.

722
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,292
He didn't fall off it either.

723
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:12,137
You're taking things too personally.

724
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:16,673
We needed a coffin
because they aren't X-rayed.

725
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:19,843
We needed a credible hijacker
who knew the plane.

726
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,274
Those are the breaks.

727
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:29,006
You really wanna kill a little girl?

728
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,112
He wouldn't mind. I know that.

729
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:38,281
The harder this gets,
the more he seems to enjoy himself.

730
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:40,651
But what about you?

731
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:47,119
What about you?

732
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,186
You wanna kill my little girl?

733
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,119
<i>Is that our suspect?</i>

734
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,659
<i>Negative on that.</i>
<i>That is not our suspect.</i>

735
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,209
Julia...

736
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:37,165
Honey, can you hear me?

737
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,230
God, what did they do to you?

738
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:21,908
OK.
Your husband didn't fall off the roof.

739
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,983
He flew off.

740
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:27,044
Come on. Come on out.

741
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:32,918
Nobody's coming for you.
You know why?

742
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:34,985
Because nobody cares.

743
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:39,532
People will think what I tell them
to think. That's how authority works.

744
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,665
We picked her up,
shoved her into a food bin

745
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:45,729
and nobody even looked up.

746
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:49,470
You understand what I'm saying?
Nobody cares about Julia.

747
01:25:51,513 --> 01:25:55,176
All right, it's over.
Let's finish it. All right.

748
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,086
We'll be safe back here, honey.

749
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:27,507
What are you gonna do?
You gonna blow us up?

750
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:29,345
No. Just you.

751
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:50,329
Good Lord, she did it.

752
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:02,678
Dispatch, this is F.B.I. Ground One.
All units back to the outer markers.

753
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:08,981
<i>Evac Transport Three</i>
<i>switching to secure three.</i>

754
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:28,273
- My God, she's...
- What is she holding?

755
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:33,072
She's holding her daughter.

756
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,951
Her daughter.

757
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:53,398
Let's go, people. Go.

758
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:01,692
She looks like you.

759
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,670
Yeah.

760
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,368
Yeah, there's a bit of her dad
in there, too.

761
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:12,201
I'm...

762
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:15,506
I'm sorry.

763
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:42,877
Miss Pratt. Our office in Berlin
has detained the morgue director.

764
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:45,435
They'd like you
to I.D. A picture of him.

765
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:47,504
Can it wait?

766
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,542
Sure.

767
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:06,258
The van's here, ma'am.
Whenever you're ready.

768
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:20,337
Honey, look.

769
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:25,179
I told you there was a little girl.

770
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:32,549
She never gave up.

771
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:38,989
Mommy?

772
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:47,698
Hi, honey.

773
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:50,973
- Mommy?
- Yeah, I'm right here.

774
01:30:51,713 --> 01:30:53,704
Mommy's right here, baby.

775
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,745
Are we there yet?

776
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:02,345
Not yet.

777
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:04,414
Almost.

778
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,256
Here. Hop on up.
