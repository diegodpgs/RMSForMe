1
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,789
Five thousand years ago...

2
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,751
a fierce warrior known
as the Scorpion King...

3
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,794
led a great army on a campaign...

4
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,380
to conquer the known world.

5
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,966
After a vicious campaign
which lasted seven long years...

6
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,760
the Scorpion King and his army
were defeated...

7
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,514
and driven deep into
the sacred desert of Ahm Shere.

8
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,749
One by one, they slowly perished
Under the scorching sun...

9
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,547
until only the great warrior himself
was left alive.

10
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,598
Near death...

11
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,852
the Scorpion King made a pact
with the dark god Anubis...

12
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,605
that if Anubis
would spare his life...

13
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,316
and let him conquer his enemies...

14
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,068
he would give him his soul.

15
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,205
Anubis accepted his offer
And spared his life.

16
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,819
Anubis gave the Scorpion King
Command of his army...

17
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,698
and like an evil flood,
they washed away...

18
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,076
all that lay before them.

19
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,630
When his task was done...

20
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,676
Anubis forced the Scorpion King
to serve him for all time.

21
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,645
His army was returned
to the sands from whence they came...

22
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,653
where they wait, silently...

23
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,864
to be awakened once again.

24
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,754
Alex?

25
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,715
What were you thinking,
a mummy had come back to life?

26
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,468
I’ll tell you a story some time.

27
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,595
What are you doing down here?
I told you to wait for us in the temple.

28
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,514
It’s dangerous down here.

29
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,308
- But I saw your tattoo.
- You saw what?

30
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,853
On a wall by the entrance.
There’s a cartouche just like it.

31
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,272
With the pyramid and the eye...

32
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,233
and the two kings and everything.

33
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,193
- Really?
- Yeah.

34
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,405
Okay. Well, I’ll be up to take
a look at that in a minute.

35
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,949
In the meantime, I want you
to wait for us up there.

36
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,951
Pick up your stuff,
and I’ll see you up in the temple.

37
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,956
Go on.

38
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,000
And what should I do?

39
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,461
I don’t know. Surprise me.

40
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,046
- Build a better mousetrap.
- Okay.

41
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,299
While your mother goes
and desecrates another tomb.

42
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,315
Go away.

43
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,945
- Those are poisonous, you know.
- Only if they bite you.

44
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,989
What was all that about?

45
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,825
Nothing.
Alex wanted to show me something.

46
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,620
I swear...

47
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,080
the kid gets more and more
like you every day.

48
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,416
You mean
more attractive, sweet...

49
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,668
and devilishly charming?

50
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,254
No, he’s driving me crazy.

51
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,173
Now, where were we?

52
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,176
Hammer and chisel.

53
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,058
All right, all right!
Let’s do it your way.

54
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,559
Thank you.

55
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,455
Ever since I had that dream...

56
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,792
this place is all
I can think about.

57
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,087
Ever since you had that dream,
I haven’t had a decent night of sleep.

58
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,216
I feel like I’ve been here before.

59
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,343
I know I’ve been here before.

60
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,596
Evy, nobody’s been here before,
not in at least 3,000 years.

61
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,598
Except for these guys.

62
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,356
Then how do I seem to know
exactly where I’m going?

63
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,831
Let’s go.

64
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,618
Knock, knock. Anybody home?

65
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,831
You two check out that stuff,
see if it’s there.

66
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,752
I’ll sort out the O’Connell’s.

67
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,139
If you move that fast enough,
you can almost write your name.

68
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,975
I just had a vision.

69
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,354
It was like my dream,
but it was real.

70
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,815
It was like I was actually here
in ancient times.

71
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,401
Well, if you actually were here...

72
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,029
could you show me
how to open this thing?

73
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,614
Hold this.

74
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,549
- Now you’re starting to scare me.
- I’m starting to scare myself.

75
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,553
What is this?
Look at the state of this rubbish.

76
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,764
The Egyptians never had a clue.
Look at that stuff.

77
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,226
It’s all chintz and stuff.
Look at that.

78
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:10,021
Cheap pottery, this.
Ancient rubbish.

79
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,235
Jacques,
something’s hit me head!

80
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,402
Shut up, Spivey.

81
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,196
This place is cursed.

82
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,119
We do not want to wake the gods.

83
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,226
That’s the emblem
of the Scorpion King.

84
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,771
He’s supposed to be pure myth.

85
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,774
No trace of him has ever been
found before. No artefacts.

86
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,734
No archival evidence.

87
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,905
- Let’s open this.
- Evy, I don’t know.

88
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,033
-I don’t have a good feeling about this.
-It’s only a chest.

89
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,077
No harm ever came
from opening a chest.

90
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,413
Right, and no harm ever came
from reading a book.

91
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,291
- Remember how that one went?
- Come on. We can’t stop now.

92
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,585
Just remember,
I was the voice of reason here.

93
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,794
For once.

94
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,629
Rubbish.

95
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,965
Dreck. Chintz.

96
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,514
God, that hurt!

97
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,828
Hon? Let’s do it your way.

98
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,641
The bracelet of Anubis.

99
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,943
I’ll take care of this.

100
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,826
Oh, my God.

101
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,703
It’s a bit late for that!

102
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,040
- Put it in your rucksack.
- Let’s leave it here.

103
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,668
- It’s a bit late for that!
- What’s it say?

104
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,629
""He who disturbs this bracelet...

105
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,840
shall drink from the Nile.``

106
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,633
That doesn’t sound too bad.

107
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:06,239
Jacques is gonna make
a nice fillet out of you, my son.

108
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,036
Spivey! Jacques!
Let’s get the hell out of here!

109
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,873
Come on.

110
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,727
This is bad, Evy.

111
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,021
- We’ve had bad before.
- This is worse.

112
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,812
Mom? Dad?

113
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,356
I can explain everything.

114
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,261
The Book of the Dead gives life.

115
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,264
And the Book of the Living...

116
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,186
takes life away.

117
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,271
I thought that was my job.

118
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,067
We’re getting close.

119
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,475
Did you acquire it?

120
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,756
We’re getting very close.

121
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,606
We found him.

122
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,444
We found him! We found him!

123
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,671
Step aside there.
Out of the way.

124
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,553
Imhotep.

125
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,597
It’s him. It’s Imhotep.

126
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,938
Now we must raise
those that serve him.

127
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,232
Get out of my way.
Get out of the way.

128
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,859
Get out of my way
or I’m gonna shoot you in the face.

129
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,320
He means it.
He shot someone before.

130
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,696
Give it to me.

131
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,825
The opportunity passed us by.

132
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:46,621
- We need that bracelet.
- We need it before it opens.

133
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,460
Enough.

134
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,048
My dear Hafez...

135
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,093
I told you
I should have handled it.

136
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,263
I did not want
your past history...

137
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,014
to cloud the issue.

138
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,392
Don’t worry. We know where it is.
We’ll take care of it.

139
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,019
No, we’ll take care of it.

140
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,939
I have a different chore
for you now.

141
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,066
Where is the bracelet?

142
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,901
It’s on its way
to merry old London.

143
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,197
Then London is where we must go.

144
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,426
l think the bracelet
is some sort of guide...

145
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,553
to the lost oasis of Ahm Shere.

146
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,347
Evy, I know what you’re thinking...

147
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,141
and the answer’s no.

148
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,185
We just got home.

149
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:53,688
That’s the beauty of it.
We’re already packed.

150
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,941
Why don’t you just give me
one good reason?

151
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,068
It’s just an oasis...

152
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,405
darling.

153
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,450
A beautiful...

154
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,035
exciting...

155
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,662
romantic...

156
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,292
oasis.

157
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:18,546
The kind with the white, sandy beach
and the palm trees...

158
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,673
and the cool, clear, blue water?

159
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:25,261
We could have some of those big drinks
with the little umbrellas.

160
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,516
- Sounds good.
- Sounds too good. What’s the catch?

161
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,143
Supposedly it’s the resting place
of Anubis army.

162
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,729
You see? I knew there’s a catch.
There’s always a catch.

163
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,689
How did I know that?
And let me guess.

164
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,442
It was commanded
by that Scorpion King guy?

165
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,195
Yes, but he only awakens
once every 5,000 years.

166
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,198
And if someone doesn’t kill him,
he’s gonna wipe out the world.

167
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,243
- How did you know?
- I didn’t, but that’s always the story.

168
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:51,246
The last known expedition
to actually reach Ahm Shere...

169
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:55,083
was sent by Ramses the Fourth
over 3,000 years ago.

170
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,044
- He sent over a thousand men.
- None of them was ever seen again.

171
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,088
- How did you know?
- I didn’t, but that’s always the story.

172
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,340
- Did I mention the pyramid of gold?
- Twice.

173
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,759
Alexander the Great
sent troops in search of it.

174
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,719
- Hooray for him.
- So did Caesar.

175
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,721
- Look what happened to his career.
- And Napoleon.

176
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:11,141
Yeah, but we’re smarter than him.

177
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,809
- Taller too.
- Exactly.

178
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,979
- That’s why we’re gonna find it.
- Because we’re taller?

179
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:20,400
- That’s why I love you.
- Nice try.

180
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,839
Mom!

181
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,966
What do I do with this chest?

182
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,968
Sucker weighs a god dang ton.

183
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,220
Alex, watch your language.

184
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,972
Rather weighty, this.

185
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,778
Evy, that first weird dream of yours
was exactly six weeks ago, right?

186
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,905
Yes, but what’s that
got to do with anything?

187
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,618
It just happens to coincide
with Egyptian New Year.

188
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,663
That’s right.
What a coincidence.

189
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,917
Maybe.

190
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,377
All I’m saying
is let’s be cautious.

191
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:33,723
If anything happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.

192
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,955
You and Alex are the only thing
that matter to me.

193
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,456
Well...

194
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:03,044
the Bembridge scholars
have been begging me...

195
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,547
to run the British Museum.

196
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,358
Cripes, how do you get
this thing off?

197
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,694
Have I kissed you today?

198
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,830
I hate it when you do that.

199
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,373
Why?

200
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:43,460
- Makes me agree to anything.
- Anything?

201
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,593
Those knickers are not mine.

202
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,221
Jonathan.

203
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,682
Alex, behave yourself
for five minutes, all right?

204
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,018
You betcha.

205
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:12,155
- Happy to be home?
- Couldn’t be happier.

206
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,699
It’s the Year of the Scorpion.

207
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,826
- Neat.
- Thought you might like that.

208
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:21,122
So I killed the mummy and his minions
and stole his sceptre.

209
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,166
Oh, you’re so brave.

210
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,210
And rich.
Did I mention rich?

211
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,587
What do you think I’m doing here?

212
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:33,468
- Sorry, we must be in the wrong house.
- You said this was your house.

213
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,095
- I didn’t.
- Call me!

214
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,390
- You’re not Sheila’s husband?
- No.

215
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:43,061
If you work for Johnny,
I was gonna pay him back on Tuesday.

216
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,396
I don’t know any Johnny.

217
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,774
We are looking for
the bracelet of Anubis.

218
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:50,652
Oh, good for you. Good thing to have,
the old bracelet of Anubis.

219
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,445
Where is it?

220
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,240
Ah, you’re looking here
for the bracelet. I see.

221
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,617
I have no idea
what you’re talking about.

222
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,745
Mr. O’Connell,
you try my patience.

223
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,457
Mr. O’Connell? Hold on a minute.
You’ve got the wrong ma--

224
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,126
That bracelet.
Now I remember.

225
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,462
- I lost it in a card game.
- For your sake, I hope not.

226
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,553
It can’t be.

227
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,979
- Where’s your wife?
- My wife?

228
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,439
You mean Evy.

229
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:30,692
I think she went off to Baden-Baden
or Tibet or something.

230
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:34,028
The girl’s a free spirit.
Did I mention I was single now?

231
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:43,037
Egyptian asps
are quite poisonous.

232
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:45,540
It’s downstairs.

233
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:51,296
There’s a safe.
The combination is 3-20-58.

234
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,756
393-something.

235
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,716
It’s in the safe downstairs.

236
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,426
I told you!

237
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,094
And your point is?

238
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:01,765
- I told you so you wouldn’t kill me.
- When did we make that arrangement?

239
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,153
Jonathan, I thought I said
no more wild parties.

240
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,489
Well, when you’re popular--

241
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:20,825
I’m serious. If you’ve lost
that key, you’re grounded.

242
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,953
I haven’t lost it. I just can’t find it.
There’s a difference.

243
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,873
Well, you better
start finding it then.

244
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,334
I will, Mom.
There’s nothing to worry about.

245
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,128
Good evening.

246
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:37,300
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

247
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,761
I’m looking for the chest,
of course.

248
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,389
Give it to me now.

249
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,395
Get out of my house.

250
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,563
Whoa, Mom.

251
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,066
- Maybe not the best idea.
- Alex, get back there.

252
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,280
Definitely not the best idea.

253
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,699
I think it’s time
to yell for Dad now.

254
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,786
- I will kill you and take it anyway.
- I think not.

255
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,999
Ardeth.
What are you doing here?

256
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,043
Perhaps explanations
are best kept for later.

257
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,753
Ardeth Bay.

258
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:15,839
Lock-Nah.

259
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,966
Hey, folks,
knowing my brother-in-law...

260
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,218
he probably deserves whatever
you’re about to do to him...

261
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,761
but this is my house.

262
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,888
I have certain rules
about snakes and dismemberment.

263
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:29,853
Shoot him!

264
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,799
Whoa, Mom!

265
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,552
- Where did you learn to do that?
- I have no idea.

266
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,851
That I learned from your father.

267
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,063
I’ll take that.

268
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:26,284
Not bad for a Medjai.

269
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,542
Let go!

270
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,346
- What’s in the chest?
- The bracelet of Anubis!

271
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:03,696
They must not get the bracelet.

272
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:05,615
Get it and get out of here!

273
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,248
Mom, look out!

274
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:15,208
Evelyn!

275
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,521
What’d you do this time?

276
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,773
I haven’t done anything
to anybody.

277
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,235
- Lately.
- Come on!

278
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,800
Rick!

279
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,636
Look out, Rick!

280
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:19,939
Dad! Dad!

281
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,443
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

282
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,618
What the hell are you doing here?
Scratch that. I don’t care.

283
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:33,745
Who are those guys
and where are they taking my wife?

284
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,790
My friend, I’m not sure...

285
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:38,374
but wherever this man is...

286
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,835
your wife will surely be.

287
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,298
Hey, I know him.
He’s the curator.

288
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,926
- He works at the British Museum.
- Are you sure?

289
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,346
Better believe him. He spends more
time there than he does at home.

290
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,767
Okay, you’re here.
The bad guys are here.

291
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,811
Evy`s been kidnapped.
Let me guess.

292
00:32:57,894 --> 00:32:59,854
They once again removed
the creature from his grave.

293
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,233
Not to point fingers, but isn’t it your
job to make sure that doesn’t happen?

294
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:06,653
That woman with him knows things
no living person could possibly know.

295
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,239
She knew exactly where
the creature was buried.

296
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:12,492
We hoped she would lead us to
the bracelet. She obviously did.

297
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,160
Now they have it.

298
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:17,163
I wouldn’t get
too nervous just yet.

299
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,083
Is that gold?

300
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,085
When I stuck it on,
I saw the pyramids at Giza.

301
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,296
Then whoosh-- straight across
the desert to Karnak.

302
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,299
You have started a chain reaction that
could bring about the next apocalypse.

303
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,970
You, lighten up.
You, big trouble.

304
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,930
You, get in the car.

305
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:42,939
I am sorry if I alarmed your son,
but you must understand.

306
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,899
Now that the bracelet’s on...

307
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:46,943
we have
7 days before the Scorpion King awakens.

308
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,445
We? What we?

309
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:51,239
If he is not killed,
he will raise the Army of Anubis.

310
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:54,325
- I take it that’s not a good thing.
- Oh, he’ll wipe out the world.

311
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:56,661
The old ""wipe out the world`` ploy.

312
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,792
Who never can kill
the Scorpion King...

313
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,794
can send his army back
to the Underworld...

314
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,630
or use it to destroy mankind
and rule the Earth.

315
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:11,885
They dug up Imhotep `cause he’s tough
enough to take out the Scorpion King.

316
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,136
That is their plan.

317
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:29,402
Alex, I got a big job for you.
Stay here and protect the car.

318
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:31,780
- I could do that.
- Protect the car?

319
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,866
Come on. Just because I’m a kid
doesn’t mean I’m stupid.

320
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,076
- I know.
- Dad!

321
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:41,080
If you see anyone come running out
screaming, it`s just me.

322
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,541
Maybe you should stay here
and watch him.

323
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,043
Now you’re talking.

324
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:52,133
- You want the shotgun?
- No, I prefer the Thompson.

325
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:03,269
If I were to say to you, I’m a stranger
travelling from the east...

326
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:05,230
seeking that which is lost--

327
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:07,899
Then I would reply that I am
a stranger travelling from the west.

328
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,354
Go, go, go!

329
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:19,956
Oh, no. Not these guys again.

330
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:31,634
What are we gonna do?

331
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,554
You’re asking me?
I’m only eight years old!

332
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:45,565
Honey, what you doin`?
These guys don’t use doors.

333
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:50,653
Where the hell`s Jonathan?

334
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,786
- Alex!
- What’s the matter with my car?

335
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:00,747
I was forced to find an alternative
means of transportation.

336
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,874
- A double-decker bus?
- It was his idea.

337
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:04,167
- Was not!
- Was too!

338
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,294
-Just go!
- It was too!

339
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:24,562
No, not my car!

340
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:30,985
Oh, I hate mummies.

341
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:34,531
- Glad to see me now?
-Just like old times, huh?

342
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:15,381
Turn, turn!

343
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:35,610
No! Get out of the way!

344
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:06,808
Look out!

345
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:11,706
Great driving, Uncle Jon.

346
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:13,208
Yeah.

347
00:47:19,297 --> 00:47:21,091
You all right?

348
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:24,260
This was my first bus ride.

349
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:35,021
- What would I do without you?
- Are all librarians this much trouble?

350
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:36,606
Jeez, get a room.

351
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:51,871
Let me go!

352
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:53,414
Silence!

353
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,626
Stop!

354
00:49:40,855 --> 00:49:43,942
Please do not fear
for your son, my friends.

355
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,611
They cannot hurt him,
for he wears the bracelet of Anubis.

356
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:49,489
Alex is wearing the bracelet?

357
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:52,659
When he put it on, he said he saw the
pyramids at Giza, the temple at Karnak.

358
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:56,204
At Karnak, the bracelet will show him
the next step of the journey.

359
00:49:57,747 --> 00:50:01,793
If we don’t get to Karnak before them,
we won’t know where to look for him.

360
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:03,837
Seems to me...

361
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,131
like we need a magic carpet.

362
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:27,610
When Lord Imhotep last
encountered the O’Connell’s...

363
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:31,197
they sent his immortal soul
to the Underworld.

364
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:34,868
As powerful as he will become,
he is still vulnerable.

365
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:38,496
Only with the Army of Anubis
will he be invincible.

366
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:42,041
He will need your help.

367
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:47,297
Keep this with you always.

368
00:50:49,382 --> 00:50:51,760
The Book of the Dead!

369
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:54,304
What a bright little child.

370
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:58,391
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

371
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:00,852
If you wish to see her again,
you’d better behave.

372
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:03,438
Lady, I don’t behave
for my parents.

373
00:51:03,563 --> 00:51:05,607
What makes you think
I’m going to do it for you?

374
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:06,775
Silence!

375
00:51:06,858 --> 00:51:11,237
Because your parents wouldn’t slip
poisonous snakes into your bed...

376
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:13,448
while you were sleeping.

377
00:51:14,282 --> 00:51:16,409
Lord Imhotep wishes
to meet the boy.

378
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,080
Now we shall see
how brave you are.

379
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:24,542
Hey, watch the suit.

380
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:26,419
Ow! Me fingers.

381
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:29,547
Nice.

382
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:33,927
Very nice.

383
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:36,096
Did you acquire what we asked?

384
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:40,350
We acquired it, all right.
You know what?

385
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:44,437
We had to kill two of those guards
at the mausoleum to acquire it.

386
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:45,939
This chest is cursed.

387
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,568
It says there is one...

388
00:51:50,693 --> 00:51:52,112
the undead...

389
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:54,572
who will kill all those
who open this chest.

390
00:51:54,697 --> 00:51:58,701
Yes, and the creature will suck them dry
then become whole again.

391
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:00,578
We’ve all heard this story before.

392
00:52:00,703 --> 00:52:04,457
Yeah, but I heard the Yanks
who found it nine years ago all died.

393
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,751
Horrible deaths, they were.

394
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:08,962
- So with that in mind--
- We want ten.

395
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:11,131
Quiet!

396
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:15,927
The agreement was for five.

397
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,847
Well, we want ten
or we’ll take it elsewhere.

398
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:21,474
- If you--
- Ten will be just fine.

399
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:22,976
Follow me, gentlemen.

400
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,688
Get in.

401
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:50,628
it is you
who are the chosen one...

402
00:52:50,754 --> 00:52:54,591
you who will take me
to Ahm Shere.

403
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:58,887
What if I don’t?
What if I get a little lost?

404
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:03,725
You have strength, little one.

405
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:08,813
You are your father’s son,
but I know something you don’t.

406
00:53:09,564 --> 00:53:11,441
This bracelet is a gift...

407
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:14,444
and a curse.

408
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:16,946
The sands of time...

409
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:19,741
have already begun
to pour against you.

410
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,830
Yeah, I already heard this part.

411
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:27,999
From the minute
I put the bracelet on...

412
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:30,668
seven days do I have
before the Scorpion King wakes up.

413
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:33,171
Did you also hear that if you
do not enter the pyramid...

414
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:35,715
before the sun strikes it
on that very morning...

415
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:39,302
that the bracelet
will suck the life out of you?

416
00:53:39,385 --> 00:53:41,262
That part I missed.

417
00:53:41,387 --> 00:53:44,641
Hey, wait a minute. That means
I’ve only got five days left.

418
00:53:44,724 --> 00:53:48,978
Then I believe it will be best
if we do not get lost, don’t you?

419
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:52,732
My dad is going to kick your ass.

420
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:01,616
I do not think so.

421
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:10,417
In here, gentlemen,
you shall receive your just rewards.

422
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,710
No tricks now, woman.

423
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:15,255
We’re not givin` up this chest
till we’re satisfied.

424
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:18,842
Don’t worry.
There is much satisfaction to be had.

425
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:29,352
What’s going on?

426
00:54:33,898 --> 00:54:37,652
This place is cursed.

427
00:54:37,777 --> 00:54:41,698
- What is it with you and curses?
- He ain`t happy without a good curse.

428
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:44,367
""This is cursed. That is cursed.``

429
00:54:44,492 --> 00:54:46,536
Give it a rest, will ya?

430
00:54:49,372 --> 00:54:51,082
Christ!

431
00:54:59,382 --> 00:55:03,219
He wants you to open the chest.
Open the chest!

432
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:27,368
Where’d he go?

433
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,370
Where’d he go?

434
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:21,589
- This is the magic carpet?
- It’ll be fine. He’s a professional.

435
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,552
Izzy!

436
00:56:31,474 --> 00:56:33,268
He definitely remembers you.

437
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:35,854
He’s a little shy.
Jonathan, get our bags.

438
00:56:35,937 --> 00:56:38,898
- Oh, my hands are full.
- Now.

439
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:41,359
- Right. I’ll get the bags.
- I’ll deal with the flight details.

440
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:46,322
- Honey, you’re not a subtle man.
- We don’t have time for subtle.

441
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,327
Izzy, come here.

442
00:56:52,662 --> 00:56:55,457
- Doesn’t look happy to see you.
- Never turned me down yet.

443
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,334
Whatever it is, whatever you need,
I don’t care. Forget it, O’Connell.

444
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:00,462
Every time I hook up with you,
I get shot.

445
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:04,174
Last time I got shot in the ass.
I’m in mourning for my ass.

446
00:57:04,257 --> 00:57:07,427
- Remember that bank job in Marrakesh?
- Bank job?

447
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:10,764
- It’s not like it sounds.
- It’s exactly how it sounds.

448
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:13,099
I’m flying high,
hiding in the sun.

449
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:16,144
The white boy here flags me down,
so I fly in low for the pick-up.

450
00:57:16,227 --> 00:57:18,354
The next thing you know,
I get shot.

451
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:20,732
I’m lying in the middle of the road
with my spleen hanging out...

452
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:23,902
and I see him waltzing up
with some belly dancer girl.

453
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:25,987
Belly dancer girl?

454
00:57:26,112 --> 00:57:28,573
- Izzy, I think you and I should talk.
- As long as I don’t get shot.

455
00:57:28,698 --> 00:57:31,576
Quit your whining.
You’re gonna get paid this time.

456
00:57:34,245 --> 00:57:37,207
Have you looked around here any?
What do I need money for?

457
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:39,667
What the hell am I
gonna spend it on?

458
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:42,504
I’m gonna keep this short.
My little boy’s out there.

459
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:44,881
I’m gonna do whatever it takes
to get him back.

460
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,682
If you give me that gold stick,
you can shave my head...

461
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:56,893
wax my legs
and use me for a surfboard.

462
00:57:58,103 --> 00:58:00,563
Didn’t we do that in Tripoli?

463
00:58:00,688 --> 00:58:03,858
Say, by the way,
when did you lose your eye?

464
00:58:05,276 --> 00:58:08,446
I didn’t. I just thought
it made me look more dashing.

465
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:12,283
Come on. Get to work.

466
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:16,913
- You’re not catching me at my best.
- Oh, I’m sure I am.

467
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:27,924
I knew it.
I’m gonna get shot.

468
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:31,511
These are the commanders
of the 1 2 tribes of the Medjai.

469
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:34,556
Horus.

470
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:41,438
Pet bird.

471
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:43,231
My best and most clever friend.

472
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:46,234
He will let the commanders know
of our progress so that they may follow.

473
00:59:04,377 --> 00:59:06,504
If the Army of Anubis arises...

474
00:59:07,922 --> 00:59:11,092
they will do all they can
to stop it.

475
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:14,679
- Are you sure Izzy is reliable?
- Yeah, he’s reliable-ish.

476
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,563
- Isn’t she beautiful?
- It’s a balloon.

477
00:59:23,646 --> 00:59:25,356
It’s a dirigible.

478
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:28,485
- Where’s your airplane?
- Airplanes are a thing of the past.

479
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,820
- Izzy, you were right.
- I was?

480
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,739
Yeah, you’re gonna get shot.

481
00:59:33,698 --> 00:59:35,742
She’s faster than she looks.

482
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:37,452
And she’s real quiet.

483
00:59:37,535 --> 00:59:41,539
Perfect for sneaking up on people,
which is a very good thing.

484
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:43,666
Unless, of course,
we go with your approach--

485
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,170
barging in face first, guns blazing,
gettin` your friends shot in the ass.

486
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:53,176
Why can’t you people ever
keep your feet on the ground?

487
01:00:39,472 --> 01:00:43,393
O’Connell does not want to believe,
but he flies like Horus to his destiny.

488
01:00:43,476 --> 01:00:47,313
Yes, very interesting.
Tell me more about this gold pyramid.

489
01:00:47,439 --> 01:00:50,066
It is written that since
the time of the Scorpion King...

490
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:53,319
no man who has laid eyes upon it
has ever returned to tell the tale.

491
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:56,072
Where is all this stuff written?
Hello!

492
01:00:58,324 --> 01:00:59,784
Got it.

493
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:06,666
Pretty nice, eh?

494
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:09,085
This is all I have left
in the world.

495
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:11,212
The rest of my fortune was lost...

496
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:13,757
to some rather unscrupulous
characters, actually.

497
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,427
If the curator reacted the way you say,
it must be very important.

498
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,888
If I were you,
I would keep it close.

499
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:23,558
My friend, the gods
couldn’t take this away from me.

500
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:25,310
- That’s mine.
- No, it’s not!

501
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:30,565
Keep your hands off it.

502
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:42,118
I want him back, Rick.

503
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:44,245
I want him in my arms.

504
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,789
I know.

505
01:01:47,832 --> 01:01:49,709
We taught him well.

506
01:01:50,877 --> 01:01:52,754
He’s smarter than you.

507
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:55,715
He’s tougher than me.

508
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,384
- I love him so much, I just can’t--
- I know. We both do.

509
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:00,303
Alex knows that.

510
01:02:02,263 --> 01:02:04,307
I’ll get him back, Evy.
I promise.

511
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:06,351
I know you will.

512
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:35,922
- Are we there yet?
- No.

513
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:50,645
That was amazing.
Perfect aim.

514
01:02:50,728 --> 01:02:53,731
What are you talking about?

515
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:55,066
I missed.

516
01:03:03,616 --> 01:03:05,577
I have to go to the bathroom.

517
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:38,651
Make it quick.

518
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:46,367
Hurry up.

519
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,540
- Hey, reading material!
- Now!

520
01:03:57,754 --> 01:04:00,632
I can’t go when someone’s watching.

521
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:05,345
I don’t trust you.
You’ll look.

522
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,480
Darn!

523
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:20,693
Oh, my God!

524
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:24,030
Doesn’t anyone around here know
how to flush a toilet?

525
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:25,633
Karnak.

526
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:09,594
If a man does not embrace his past,
he has no future.

527
01:06:09,677 --> 01:06:11,054
Look...

528
01:06:11,137 --> 01:06:15,433
even if I was some sort
of sacred Medjai...

529
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:17,393
what good does that do me now?

530
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,646
It is the missing piece
of your heart.

531
01:06:19,729 --> 01:06:23,566
If you embrace it and accept it,
you can do anything.

532
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,193
Sounds great.

533
01:06:25,276 --> 01:06:28,279
Listen, what can we expect
from our old friend Imhotep?

534
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:31,032
His powers are returning quickly.

535
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:34,744
When he reaches Ahm Shere, even the
Scorpion King won’t be able to stop him.

536
01:12:34,813 --> 01:12:38,566
Evy, I know you haven’t been yourself
lately with these dreams and visions--

537
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:41,402
No, they’re memories
from my previous life.

538
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:44,280
Honestly, I’m not losing my mind.
It all makes perfect sense now.

539
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,908
- That’s why we found the bracelet?
- Exactly.

540
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:50,120
- I was its protector.
- Now do you believe, my friend?

541
01:12:50,203 --> 01:12:52,497
Clearly, you were destined
to protect this woman.

542
01:12:52,622 --> 01:12:55,792
Right. She’s a reincarnated princess,
and I’m a warrior for God.

543
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:59,963
Your son leads the way to Ahm Shere.
Three sides of the pyramid.

544
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:02,841
This was all preordained
thousands of years ago.

545
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:04,551
And how does the story end?

546
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:07,345
Only the journey`s written,
not the destination.

547
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:08,513
Convenient.

548
01:13:08,596 --> 01:13:10,640
How else do you explain
Evy`s visions?

549
01:13:10,723 --> 01:13:13,518
That it is your son
who wears the bracelet?

550
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:16,271
- How do you explain your mark?
- Coincidence.

551
01:13:16,354 --> 01:13:20,650
My friend, there is a fine line
between coincidence and fate.

552
01:13:41,045 --> 01:13:42,756
Don’t even think about it.

553
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,387
Hold on there, partner.

554
01:13:52,098 --> 01:13:54,476
When the time comes...

555
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:58,354
I shall truly enjoy killing you.

556
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:01,691
But until that time...

557
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:04,778
you’d better be
a little nicer to me.

558
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:07,071
Now, where’s my water?

559
01:14:11,284 --> 01:14:12,744
No ice?

560
01:14:17,332 --> 01:14:19,292
Make sure he doesn’t move!

561
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:52,117
They’ve gone.
We’ve lost them.

562
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:20,895
Alex left us his tie...

563
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:24,816
and he made us
a little sand castle.

564
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:27,360
It’s the Temple Island of Philae.

565
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:30,363
- They’ve gone to Philae.
- Attaboy, Alex. Come on!

566
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:44,919
The great temple of Abu Simbel.

567
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:15,885
That’s the Blue Nile down there.
We must be out of Egypt by now.

568
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:19,848
In ancient times, all this
still belonged to the upper kingdom.

569
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:22,183
The oasis must be
around here somewhere.

570
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:25,228
Don’t worry. We’ll find him.
He’s a smart kid.

571
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:27,272
He’ll leave us a sign.

572
01:17:32,318 --> 01:17:34,362
Surprised to see me?

573
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:36,781
Leaving bread crumbs, huh?

574
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:33,129
We’re in trouble!

575
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:47,185
Horus, fly!

576
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:54,651
Izzy, come hard right!
Starboard! Starboard!

577
01:19:37,193 --> 01:19:40,447
Was there a little something
you forgot to mention?

578
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:46,453
People?

579
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:07,432
Ahm Shere.

580
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:19,068
Right.

581
01:20:25,825 --> 01:20:26,993
He’s back!

582
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:32,165
Hang on!

583
01:20:45,804 --> 01:20:47,680
Well, that’s not good.

584
01:20:49,557 --> 01:20:51,017
Hang on!

585
01:20:57,857 --> 01:21:00,068
Mom?

586
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:02,320
Dad?

587
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:12,705
We’re gonna go get my son.

588
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:15,750
Then we’re gonna want to get out of here
fast, so make this work, Izzy.

589
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:20,046
You don’t understand. This thing was
filled with gas. Not hot air, gas.

590
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:23,842
I need gas to get this thing in the air.
Where am I gonna get gas around here?

591
01:21:23,925 --> 01:21:26,594
Bananas? Mangoes?
Tarzan’s ass?

592
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:29,931
Maybe I could finagle it
to take hot air.

593
01:21:30,014 --> 01:21:33,184
But do you know how many cubic meters
I’d need? It’s too big!

594
01:21:33,309 --> 01:21:37,230
If anybody can fill this thing up
with hot air, Izzy, it’s you.

595
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:45,405
Come to Daddy.

596
01:21:58,334 --> 01:22:00,628
So, Rick, what’s the plan?

597
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:02,505
Let’s find some higher ground.

598
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,867
- I must go.
- Where?

599
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,161
To tell the commanders where we are.

600
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:36,372
- If the Army of Anubis arises--
- I need you to help me find my son.

601
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,340
Then first I shall help you.
Thank you.

602
01:23:23,878 --> 01:23:26,256
Look. Roman legionnaires.

603
01:23:28,341 --> 01:23:32,595
And here, turn-of-the-century French.
Napoleon’s troops.

604
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:35,765
What in the name of Anubis did this?

605
01:23:56,244 --> 01:23:58,288
- You hear that?
- What?

606
01:23:59,497 --> 01:24:01,458
Nothing.

607
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:03,126
Absolutely nothing.

608
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:07,464
My word!

609
01:24:10,633 --> 01:24:13,011
I say, chaps, look at this.

610
01:24:13,094 --> 01:24:16,848
Shrunken heads.
I’d love to know how they do that.

611
01:24:19,684 --> 01:24:21,102
Just curious.

612
01:24:26,232 --> 01:24:28,443
You any good with that?

613
01:24:28,568 --> 01:24:32,155
Three times Fox and Hound`s
grand champion. You any good with that?

614
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,950
You’ll know soon enough...

615
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:40,246
because the only way to kill an Anubis
warrior is by taking off its head.

616
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,208
I’ll remember that.

617
01:24:47,796 --> 01:24:49,756
Try to remember to...

618
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:54,719
just keep it tight
in the shoulder and...

619
01:24:56,304 --> 01:24:59,099
lead the target a little bit,
and then...

620
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:02,393
squeeze the trigger--
don’t pull it.

621
01:25:04,771 --> 01:25:06,648
I won’t miss.

622
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:46,980
Pyramid.

623
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,151
Cripes, I’m in trouble now.

624
01:25:51,234 --> 01:25:54,028
Now may I kill him?

625
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:08,251
- Retrieve that bracelet.
- With pleasure.

626
01:26:34,694 --> 01:26:38,114
Something is coming.

627
01:27:00,553 --> 01:27:03,640
That’s my husband
and my son down there.

628
01:27:03,723 --> 01:27:05,850
Make me proud.

629
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:08,103
Today’s that day, Evy.

630
01:27:16,069 --> 01:27:17,320
Where’s the boy?

631
01:28:36,357 --> 01:28:37,942
The Black Book!

632
01:28:43,323 --> 01:28:44,949
Let’s go!

633
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:15,980
There you are!

634
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:20,443
The time has come,
my little friend.

635
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:22,695
Let go!

636
01:29:39,587 --> 01:29:42,549
- Dad!
- Alex!

637
01:30:03,069 --> 01:30:05,989
Time to remove that bracelet,
my good son.

638
01:30:16,624 --> 01:30:18,084
Behind you!

639
01:31:41,668 --> 01:31:44,587
- Let’s go.
- Thank God for that.

640
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:55,515
The two of you must
sacrifice yourselves for me.

641
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:59,018
You shall be rewarded in heaven!

642
01:32:16,786 --> 01:32:18,246
Nice shootin`, Tex.

643
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:21,583
- What were those creepy pygmy things?
-Just the local natives.

644
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:23,626
- Are you sure?
- I’m sure. It was nothing.

645
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:27,005
Come on, Mom. Come on, Dad.
We have to get to the pyramid.

646
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:29,007
I have to get the bracelet off now!

647
01:32:29,132 --> 01:32:31,176
Leave it on.
Looks good on you.

648
01:32:31,259 --> 01:32:33,303
No, you guys, you don’t understand.

649
01:32:33,428 --> 01:32:38,141
It’ll kill me if I don’t get inside
the pyramid before the sun hits it...

650
01:32:38,266 --> 01:32:39,267
today!

651
01:32:39,392 --> 01:32:41,269
Oh, my God.

652
01:32:44,063 --> 01:32:45,940
Time to go!

653
01:32:46,983 --> 01:32:48,943
I thought you said
it was nothing!

654
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:03,458
Where`s Jonathan?

655
01:33:13,426 --> 01:33:16,346
Look! There’s a burial ground!
We’re safe! We’re safe!

656
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:18,807
They’ll never cross
those sacred stones!

657
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:22,060
- You are sure?
- Yes, of course I’m sure.

658
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:38,576
Sorry. My mistake.

659
01:33:47,585 --> 01:33:50,296
- Wait for me!
- Hurry up, Jonathan!

660
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:53,216
Wait for me!

661
01:33:53,299 --> 01:33:56,803
-What’s that for?
-Just something in case of an emergency.

662
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:20,869
Let’s go, Alex.

663
01:34:29,961 --> 01:34:33,381
Run! Come on, Alex, faster!

664
01:34:35,341 --> 01:34:37,635
Dad! The bracelet!

665
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:40,013
Come on! Come on!

666
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:04,370
You know...

667
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:07,540
it’s not easy being a dad.

668
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:11,878
Yeah, but you do it really good.

669
01:35:12,962 --> 01:35:14,130
Thanks.

670
01:35:32,982 --> 01:35:35,985
They made it.
Thank God.

671
01:35:36,903 --> 01:35:39,280
Yes. Great.

672
01:35:39,364 --> 01:35:41,157
Fabulous.

673
01:36:10,228 --> 01:36:13,314
-She’s going to be all right, isn’t she?
-She’ll be fine.

674
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,899
Take him.

675
01:36:14,983 --> 01:36:16,693
Mommy’s fine.

676
01:36:16,776 --> 01:36:18,153
It’s okay.

677
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:21,364
Your mother’s
going to be fine. Okay?

678
01:36:22,657 --> 01:36:25,368
You’re real strong.
You’re gonna make it.

679
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:26,786
You’re fine.

680
01:36:27,912 --> 01:36:29,789
What do I do?

681
01:36:33,626 --> 01:36:35,920
Take care of Alex.

682
01:36:39,507 --> 01:36:40,925
Sweetheart, no.

683
01:36:42,969 --> 01:36:44,554
I love you.

684
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:03,782
Come back, Evy.

685
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:08,077
Come back.

686
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:36,958
Stay here.

687
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:14,472
Try to think of it
like this, Alex.

688
01:40:14,556 --> 01:40:16,933
She’s gone to a better place.

689
01:40:17,058 --> 01:40:19,936
- Like it says in the good book.
- The book!

690
01:40:20,019 --> 01:40:21,813
- What?
- That’s it.

691
01:40:21,938 --> 01:40:23,398
- That’s it!
- That’s what?

692
01:40:23,481 --> 01:40:26,651
Come on, Uncle Jon!
That’s it! The book!

693
01:40:35,994 --> 01:40:38,121
You’re too late, O’Connell.

694
01:40:38,246 --> 01:40:40,123
I have released
the Army of Anubis.

695
01:40:40,206 --> 01:40:43,543
Lord Imhotep shall soon
kill the Scorpion King...

696
01:40:43,626 --> 01:40:45,587
and take command.

697
01:40:45,712 --> 01:40:47,672
Not after I get through with him.

698
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,841
You realize, of course,
that this can only be done...

699
01:41:31,925 --> 01:41:34,385
by someone who can actually read
ancient Egyptian.

700
01:41:34,469 --> 01:41:37,430
I don’t know about you,
but I’m a tad rusty.

701
01:41:38,723 --> 01:41:41,101
- Now where?
- We go right.

702
01:41:41,226 --> 01:41:43,603
How do you know?

703
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:49,150
Basically,
""This way to the Scorpion King.``

704
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:52,028
Mum taught me.

705
01:41:55,406 --> 01:41:57,283
This just might work.

706
01:42:28,314 --> 01:42:30,859
It’s time someone taught you
a lesson, wench. Come on.

707
01:42:39,659 --> 01:42:41,286
This is for my sister.

708
01:44:30,645 --> 01:44:32,439
Is that all you’ve got?

709
01:45:24,824 --> 01:45:26,618
Hurry up, Alex!

710
01:46:21,005 --> 01:46:23,967
Uncle Jon, I don’t know
what this last symbol is!

711
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:25,635
What’s it look like?

712
01:46:25,718 --> 01:46:27,429
It’s a bird. A stork!

713
01:46:29,931 --> 01:46:32,934
I know that one!
I know that one!

714
01:46:33,059 --> 01:46:35,019
Then what is it?

715
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:40,859
That’s it!

716
01:47:23,943 --> 01:47:26,738
Why don’t you pick on somebody
your own size?

717
01:47:27,489 --> 01:47:28,573
Oh, my God.

718
01:47:28,698 --> 01:47:30,742
- Evy!
- Take Alex. Go and help Rick.

719
01:47:30,825 --> 01:47:32,869
- But, Mom--
- No ""buts.``

720
01:47:32,952 --> 01:47:33,870
Come on.

721
01:47:37,415 --> 01:47:39,375
I’ll be just fine.

722
01:47:39,501 --> 01:47:41,461
- We did it, Uncle Jon!
- Right, partner.

723
01:47:41,586 --> 01:47:43,463
Now let’s go help your dad.

724
01:49:46,086 --> 01:49:48,129
That’s a little something new.

725
01:50:16,324 --> 01:50:18,451
My lord!

726
01:50:20,078 --> 01:50:21,955
Save me! Save me!

727
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:49,584
Okay, now I’m a believer.

728
01:51:55,632 --> 01:51:56,716
It’s a spear!

729
01:51:56,841 --> 01:51:59,552
The golden stick thing!
It’s a spear!

730
01:51:59,636 --> 01:52:02,639
Really?
Doesn’t look like a spear!

731
01:52:03,473 --> 01:52:05,350
That’s because
it opens up into one!

732
01:52:05,475 --> 01:52:07,852
Yes? And?

733
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:11,523
It opens up into a spear!

734
01:53:06,828 --> 01:53:09,372
- Twist it!
- Push!

735
01:53:09,456 --> 01:53:10,707
You have to pull!

736
01:53:13,418 --> 01:53:14,836
Jonathan, quick!

737
01:53:29,559 --> 01:53:32,270
Throw it!
Kill the Scorpion King!

738
01:53:32,353 --> 01:53:34,314
Send his army
back to the Underworld!

739
01:53:34,439 --> 01:53:37,358
Step aside, Alex.
I’m a professional.

740
01:54:40,964 --> 01:54:44,884
Go to hell,
and take your friends with you!

741
01:56:22,232 --> 01:56:25,193
Get out of here!
Just get out of here!

742
01:56:46,339 --> 01:56:47,507
Hang on, Rick!

743
01:58:03,625 --> 01:58:05,043
Let’s go up!

744
01:58:24,354 --> 01:58:28,274
This whole damn place is gonna
get sucked up! Let’s move up! Go!

745
01:58:41,746 --> 01:58:43,331
Go, Alex!

746
01:58:54,259 --> 01:58:56,136
Rick, we’re trapped!

747
01:59:09,441 --> 01:59:13,445
Get your butts moving! Hurry up!
I haven’t got all day!

748
01:59:17,323 --> 01:59:19,367
You’re next! Go!

749
01:59:26,833 --> 01:59:28,877
Jonathan! Hold on!

750
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,046
- Pull him up!
- Pull me up!

751
01:59:33,965 --> 01:59:37,886
Wait! Wait!
Let me down! Let me down!

752
01:59:37,969 --> 01:59:41,389
- It’s not worth your life, you idiot!
- Yes, it is! Yes, it is!

753
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:45,894
Right.

754
01:59:52,734 --> 01:59:55,820
Pull me up! Pull me up!

755
02:00:15,256 --> 02:00:18,760
- O’Connell, you almost got me killed!
- At least you didn’t get shot.

756
02:00:21,179 --> 02:00:24,099
Thank you! Thank you!

757
02:00:28,103 --> 02:00:31,189
O’Connell, who the hell have you
been messing with this time, huh?

758
02:00:31,314 --> 02:00:32,565
You know, the usual.

759
02:00:32,690 --> 02:00:35,860
Mummies, pygmies...

760
02:00:35,985 --> 02:00:37,946
big bugs.

761
02:01:06,474 --> 02:01:09,394
I thought
I almost lost you there.

762
02:01:09,477 --> 02:01:11,354
For a moment there, you did.

763
02:01:12,814 --> 02:01:15,275
Would you like to know
what heaven looks like?

764
02:01:16,651 --> 02:01:18,111
Later.

765
02:01:22,157 --> 02:01:24,200
- Oh, please!
- Oh, please!

766
02:01:24,325 --> 02:01:26,369
- That’s half mine, you know.
- What?

767
02:01:26,494 --> 02:01:29,831
- That’s half mine.
- What are you talking about?

768
02:01:29,914 --> 02:01:32,041
You took my gold stick!

769
02:01:32,167 --> 02:01:36,421
I swear on the head of my wife, I have
no idea what you’re talking about.

770
02:01:36,504 --> 02:01:38,298
You aunt got a wife!

771
02:01:38,423 --> 02:01:40,800
I don’t have
your gold stick either!
