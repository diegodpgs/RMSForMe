1
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,812
Evening.

2
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:15,073
Hello. Hello.

3
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,712
-Hello.
-Hello.

4
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,338
-Hello. Hello.
-Hello.

5
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,608
-Hello.
-Hello--

6
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,984
Hello. Hello.

7
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,718
Give it to me!

8
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:37,526
-Eight bucks?
-Business is slow.

9
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:41,466
Get a new business
or move out of the neighborhood!

10
00:03:58,388 --> 00:04:04,156
-Come on.
-Hey, take that! Pig!

11
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,301
Get your hands off me!

12
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:17,432
So am l ever gonna get an answer
out of you guys?

13
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,599
-Well, sir....
-Well.

14
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:24,338
-Congratulations, captain.
-What is it now, chief?

15
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,004
lt's official.

16
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,379
This is now the worst precinct
in the entire city.

17
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:33,852
Would you look at this?
Burglary, up 36 percent.

18
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:36,819
Armed robbery, up 20 percent.

19
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:40,656
Vandalism, up 44 percent.

20
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,924
Sir, l think if you'll check,
burglary is up 48 percent.

21
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,465
There. You hear that?

22
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,899
-Who are you?
-Mauser, sir. M as in ''man'' ...

23
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:50,972
-...A-U-S as in ''Sam''--
-Shut up and sit down, Mauser.

24
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,541
-He didn't ask for your biography.
-E-R, sir.

25
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,770
Look, Hurst, what do you expect?

26
00:04:56,946 --> 00:05:01,747
You cut my budget, you cut my staff.
l got nothing to work with.

27
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,410
Look around! These guys are old.
They're tired.

28
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:08,088
They just can't cut it anymore.

29
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:11,090
Maybe they need
a new captain, Lassard.

30
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,758
The mayor wants results.
You remember the mayor?

31
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:17,923
She wants something done about this.
What do you propose?

32
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:21,634
Take your nose out of my business,
go to the mayor's office...

33
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,795
...and put it where it usually is.

34
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:30,805
You have exactly 30 days to turn
this precinct around, or you are out.

35
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,279
Do you understand me?
Thirty days and that's it!

36
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,941
l need at least a dozen new men.

37
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:40,778
-You can have six.
-Well, thank you!

38
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:43,087
You better get started.

39
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,592
Excuse me, captain.

40
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,664
Get me the police academy.
l wanna speak to my brother.

41
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,931
Sir. Chief.

42
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:04,910
Sir, if l may be so bold,
l would like to apologize...

43
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:09,177
...for Captain Lassard's remark about
your nose being up the mayor's....

44
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:14,880
Chief, l've got some new ideas
on how to run this precinct.

45
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:18,960
-Oh, l'll bet you do, Mauser.
-Long-range plans, sir...

46
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,824
...planning steps, deployment.

47
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:27,493
See, sir, it's really a question
of leadership that works.

48
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,939
Lassard's got 30 days.

49
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:35,404
lf he should blow it, the job is yours.

50
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:40,007
l fully understand, sir.

51
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:45,852
Mauser, you are the most incredible
ass-kisser l have ever seen.

52
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:48,217
Thank you very much, sir.
l do my best.

53
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,363
She must be out to lunch.
Police academy.

54
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:02,731
Hello. Eric Lassard, please.

55
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:06,273
This is Commandant Eric Lassard
speaking.

56
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,842
-Eric, this is Pete.
-Pete?

57
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,672
-Your brother.
-Pete!

58
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:15,415
How very, very nice of you to call.
How's my baby brother?

59
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:18,577
Just fine, Eric.
Actually, not too good.

60
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:20,321
Oh, what's up?

61
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,592
Eric, l've got a problem here.

62
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,756
Yeah, we all have our little problems.

63
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:31,024
Yeah, but this one is serious.

64
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,731
l hope you haven't got a girl
into trouble.

65
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:37,930
No. l need to get my hands
on some healthy young men.

66
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:40,940
l guess there are places
you could go....

67
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,069
-Certain bars and so on.
-Eric, what are you talking about?

68
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:47,045
Does Margaret know about this?

69
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,947
Eric, l'm in trouble here,
and l need some new recruits.

70
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:55,153
Oh, well, that's easy.

71
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:59,988
We have some very, very fine
young graduates here at the academy.

72
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:03,428
Come on. Come on.
Double time. Double time.

73
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,124
Pick it up. Move it. Move it.

74
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:10,261
Come on! Move it!
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

75
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,111
Now, Brian, l want you
to go straight to class today.

76
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:21,273
-Why should l?
-Because l said so.

77
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,351
-Big deal.
-You mind your manners, mister.

78
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,322
-l don't have to, bird face.
-That does it. You're in trouble.

79
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:33,690
Oh, l'm just really scared.

80
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,762
-Can l help you, ma'am?
-Yes, officer.

81
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,533
My son Brian is always late for school.
Could you speak to him?

82
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:50,145
-Perhaps give him a little scare?
-Certainly, ma'am.

83
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:56,248
Hi, Brian.

84
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,354
lt's almost 0800 hours.
Time to deploy for school.

85
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:02,082
l'll go when l'm ready.

86
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,988
You're ready now, mister.

87
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,495
Now move it!
Move it! Move it!

88
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:16,697
-Thank you, officer.
-No problem, ma'am.

89
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:24,143
-lt's really no better than television.
-l wouldn't know.

90
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,076
l never watch television.

91
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:29,207
Personally, l don't even own a television.

92
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:56,435
Hungry, Diane?

93
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:15,529
For God's sakes, Michael,
just take me home.

94
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,814
-Hey, Tim.
-Mahoney, what's happening?

95
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:15,547
-How you doing?
-All right!

96
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,989
-Listen, Tim, l got a problem.
-What's that?

97
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,822
-There's some guy ripping up my beach.
-No!

98
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,589
-Who was it?
-You!

99
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,657
-Listen, Tim. Do me a favor.
-You got it!

100
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,827
-Get off the beach.
-You don't got it!

101
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:32,531
-Come on, Tim, be a good boy.
-No way! Out, guys!

102
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,042
So long, fuzz ball!

103
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,215
Never fool with a fuzz ball.

104
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,486
lt's a real pleasure to welcome you men,
and you, to the 1 6th Precinct.

105
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,962
My brother tells me you're among the finest
recruits ever to graduate the academy.

106
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:36,696
The 1 6th serves and protects
what was once a great neighborhood.

107
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:40,205
Unfortunately, a vicious gang
has taken over...

108
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:42,810
...and they're trying to control the streets.

109
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:45,776
We don't know who they are
or where they come from.

110
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:49,111
We do know that they are scum.

111
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:52,947
And it is our job to find them
and bust them.

112
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:57,916
You've all received training in the latest
techniques in urban law enforcement.

113
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:01,654
Any of you have any special skills
that l should know about?

114
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:05,767
l just learned to perform an emergency
tracheotomy with a steak knife, sir.

115
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,609
So these academy rats
are gonna save the precinct, right?

116
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:19,737
Hey, personally, lieutenant,
l hope they fall flat on their asses.

117
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,817
-That could be arranged, you know.
-What do you mean?

118
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:27,820
lf they fail, Lassard's out.
That makes me the captain.

119
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,619
lf l'm captain, l'll need
a new watch commander.

120
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:33,091
So?

121
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:38,029
-So we make sure they fail.
-Who?

122
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:42,129
-The new recruits.
-Why?

123
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:44,431
lf they fail, Lassard is out. l'm in.

124
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,633
l'm gonna need somebody
to be the new watch commander.

125
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,802
And you know who that's gonna be.

126
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,141
-Who?
-You, dickhead. You.

127
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:56,774
Oh, good idea.

128
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,986
-Not playing with a full deck, are you?
-Oh, l don't play cards.

129
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:07,761
l want this to be the best damn
Crime Suppression Unit in the city.

130
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,196
l want us to stand proud and walk tall.

131
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:14,529
More than anything...

132
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:18,302
...l want this to be, well...

133
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,408
...one big family...

134
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:24,774
...with a bunch of brothers
and little sister...

135
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,347
...and one big mother.

136
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:33,452
Wake up!
l am your watch commander.

137
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,854
When you foul up,
and you will foul up...

138
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:41,326
...l'm gonna be there
to write up a report.

139
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:45,331
Three bad reports,
and you're suspended.

140
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:48,965
-What is your name?
-Hooks, sir.

141
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,400
-Say that again.
-Hooks.

142
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:55,806
Hooks. Well, Officer Hooks,
can l please see your service revolver?

143
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,410
Don't point that gun at me.

144
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,745
-There's no round in the chamber.
-l was afraid it might go off.

145
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,014
Oh, heavens to be! lt might go off!
That's one for Hooks.

146
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:13,186
You're on report.
See how it works? lt's real simple.

147
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,564
This squad deploys
each day at 1 000 hours.

148
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,771
Precisely 1 000 hours.

149
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:27,272
Since you boys and girls
are only rookies...

150
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:30,571
...you will be assigned
a veteran officer...

151
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:34,045
...who will write up a report.

152
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,812
Okay, read the assignments.

153
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:41,856
-Fackler!
-Yes, sir.

154
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,323
Officer Fackler. The gentleman
on your right is Officer Dooley.

155
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:47,655
A fine man.
He's gonna teach you a lot.

156
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,860
-Tackleberry?
-Yes, sir, sir!

157
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,864
Officer Tackleberry.
You're trained for motorcycle duty?

158
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:58,236
Yes, sir!

159
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,171
You've got it.
Meet Officer Kirkland at the motor pool.

160
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:08,078
-Thank you, sir!
-Well, get going. Yeah! Go, go, go, go.

161
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,810
-Hightower.
-Yo!

162
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:13,881
-Yo?
-Yo, sir.

163
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,787
Yo, sir! Must be from the South.
lt's, ''Yes, sir.''

164
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,957
You got foot patrol.
Okay, that's it.

165
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,463
-Thank you for your patience.
-What about me? Don't l get a car?

166
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,965
''What about me, sir?
Don't l get a car?''

167
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:30,196
You don't get a car.
You get yourself a nice little desk...

168
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:35,708
...with a nice little chair, in a nice
little office, for your nice little voice.

169
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,108
-Asshole.
-That's two.

170
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:49,854
Chest, 48.

171
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,252
Waist, 44.

172
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:58,323
-Outseam, 39.
-Hey, can l have that giraffe?

173
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,899
No.

174
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,906
l got an idea.

175
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:09,602
-How's about for a Snickers bar?
-You got it.

176
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,042
Thanks.

177
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:19,382
Overall, 48.

178
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,318
Next.

179
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,461
Please take off your gun belt.

180
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:41,365
Chest, 37.

181
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,247
Waist, 32. Okay, turn around.

182
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:53,813
Please be gentle.

183
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,253
Jones, got you figured for an asshole.

184
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,298
l don't take shit from you people.
l'm not gonna start.

185
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:09,062
Don't think, don't talk, don't breathe
unless l tell you. Understand?

186
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,570
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

187
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,106
We're gonna get along just fine.

188
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,141
-Did you hear that?
-No, sir.

189
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:30,725
Doggone it! We got ourselves a flat tire.
Get out and check your side.

190
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:36,228
Mine's okay. How's yours?

191
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,389
Fine, sir.

192
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,872
There it goes again.

193
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,317
Officer Eugene Tackleberry
reporting for duty, sir!

194
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:01,649
Officer Kathleen Kirkland...

195
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:04,918
...and l appreciate
you not calling me sir.

196
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:15,265
All right. Mount up, Tackleberry.
Let's go.

197
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,242
Oh, this neighborhood ain't so bad.

198
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,180
You know the secret
to being a good cop?

199
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:33,617
You gotta get to know the people.

200
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:38,083
-Yo, man, you got a match?
-Sure. Here. Keep the pack.

201
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,752
-Thank you.
-Good. Very good!

202
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,627
That's the idea, son. You gotta
build up trust with the people.

203
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,769
Then they'll respect you.
Know what l mean?

204
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:52,473
Give me two of them glazed doughnuts.

205
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,303
l'll have a chocolate.

206
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,881
Excuse me, sir. Officer Carey
Mahoney reporting for duty, sir.

207
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,284
Officer Mahoney.
lt's nice of you to drop by.

208
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,014
-l missed you earlier.
-Had to get a new uniform.

209
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,321
Oh, good. Good. We can't face
the public naked, can we?

210
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:15,986
That's right. Where would
we hang our handcuffs?

211
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:20,897
That's cute. l like an officer
with a sense of humor.

212
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,000
l like you too, sir.

213
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,335
l admire a guy who's
not ashamed to floss.

214
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,674
You know, sir, oral hygiene is something
too many big-city cops overlook.

215
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:38,518
Oh, good. Good.
So you like hygiene, huh?

216
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,951
Then you're gonna like
your new partner:

217
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:43,614
Officer Vinnie Schtulman.

218
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:05,145
Hello? Hello?

219
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:08,876
-Hello.
-Who is it?

220
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,848
Carey Mahoney, your new partner.

221
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,850
-Come on in. Come on in.
-Thanks.

222
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,422
-Make yourself at home.
-Alrighty. Alrighty.

223
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:22,353
-Don't sit in the broken chair.
-Right. l got it. l saw it. l saw it.

224
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,556
Would you like breakfast? l got eggs.

225
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:29,500
l'm fine. l'll get something later.
Tetanus shot, maybe.

226
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:34,701
-This is an excellent place you got here.
-Thanks. l decorated it myself.

227
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,107
-Hey! Vinnie Schtulman.
-l got peanut butter on my hand.

228
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,908
-l like peanut butter.
-Mahoney. Nice to meet you.

229
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,477
Hey, would it be okay
if l eat real quick?

230
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,382
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Thanks.

231
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,457
Next to lunch and dinner, breakfast
is the most important meal of the day.

232
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,592
Oh, jeez. Bunky.

233
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:59,223
Bunky, how many times l gotta tell you?
The litter box! The litter box!

234
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:08,106
-You sure you don't want any?
-l'm on a diet.

235
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,368
-Want me to lock the door?
-No, neighbors might borrow something.

236
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:16,347
-lt's gonna be great having a new partner.
-l was thinking about it--

237
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:17,849
l hope Lou's not jealous.

238
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:30,865
Hey. Your pastrami's ready.

239
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,995
Did you put the mayo on that?

240
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,167
You've been quiet. l take it you
don't like your assignment.

241
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,299
-That's affirmative.
-ls it because l'm a woman?

242
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:46,470
l decline to answer that question
out of respect for your gender.

243
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:51,648
l'll take care of myself.
You just cover your own ass.

244
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,754
That's a nice piece.

245
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,619
l was referring to your side arm.

246
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,125
May l?

247
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,890
Sure.

248
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,958
lt's a Colt Python.

249
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:14,169
-What kind of load do you use?
-1 58-grain semi-wadcutter manstoppers.

250
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:16,803
Sensible weapon.

251
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,946
l use a factory-accurized
Detonics .45 Scoremaster.

252
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:24,984
lt's got the extended barrel,
short hammer fall...

253
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,452
...and l load with 230-grain
full patch rounds.

254
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:30,921
lt's primarily for stopping power.

255
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,584
On the other hand,
if you want penetration...

256
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:38,358
...the .357 will crack
the engine block of a truck.

257
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:42,966
l can see where that would be useful.

258
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:47,003
All right. Touchdown!
All right! Good job!

259
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,736
-Give me another one.
-Look at the little football players.

260
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,309
-Hey! We're playing ball.
-Come on, punk.

261
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:56,212
-Give it back.
-You want the ball?

262
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:59,376
-Give me the ball!
-Here. Go get it!

263
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:08,019
-You never seen a football?
-Hey! Hey, copper!

264
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,061
Throw me the ball!

265
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,259
Come on, will you throw it back here?
Come on! Give it to me!

266
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:28,472
-This is not such a bad neighborhood.
-This is a great neighborhood.

267
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,049
-Yeah?
-l grew up here.

268
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,583
-No way.
-Yeah.

269
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:35,154
-Little kid here.
-Little Schtulman running around here?

270
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:37,348
-You were little?
-That was me.

271
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:40,891
We should get Lou out of the truck.
He needs exercise.

272
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,895
-We can get him later.
-Carey, look at this.

273
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,626
A Nestle Crunch bar,
hardly even been touched.

274
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,066
No wonder. Got ants all over it.

275
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,367
-You're not gonna eat that, are you?
-You wanna split it?

276
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:55,874
No!

277
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:11,019
No, no, no. What do you
want from me? Blood? Get out!

278
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,054
Be cool, old man.

279
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:20,466
Open the safe. Come on. Hurry up.
Open it.

280
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,365
Come on. Open it up.

281
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:35,476
-lt always does that.
-Hurry it up.

282
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,081
There. l got it.

283
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:41,719
Fizzies.

284
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,448
They don't make them anymore.
Remember?

285
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,025
Fizzies?

286
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,463
Cops!

287
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,793
Stay down, or you're dead.

288
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,664
-Schtulman, you see a gun?
-l saw a gun.

289
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:57,668
That's an armed robbery.

290
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:03,340
-Unit M-1 5 to base.
-This is base.

291
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:09,347
We've got a 21 1
at 302 Caroline Street. Please advise.

292
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:14,921
-M-1 , did you read that?
-1 0-4. Tell them to move in.

293
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,753
-Shouldn't they wait for backup?
-No, they don't need a backup.

294
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:22,693
-Do you need a hearing aid?
-Move in, M-1 5.

295
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:25,025
1 0-4.

296
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,891
Come on. Let's go.

297
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:34,636
Follow me and stay low.

298
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:03,468
Are you in here?

299
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:11,140
Vinnie, if they are in here,
they're not gonna tell us.

300
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:18,286
Now, cover me.

301
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:50,541
-Fackler!
-Mahoney!

302
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,845
Fackler!

303
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,479
Tackleberry! Hold your fire!

304
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:30,089
Mahoney?

305
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,599
Officer Hightower.

306
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:47,172
-You met Mr. Sweetchuck, l presume?
-Mr. Sweetchuck, l'm so sorry.

307
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,469
My store! My store!

308
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:53,571
We all got here at the same time.

309
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:55,306
We didn't know that we were--

310
00:28:58,219 --> 00:28:59,652
Gentlemen...

311
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,990
...you've really outdone yourselves,
haven't you?

312
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:06,826
''Said officers did then
discharge their weapons...

313
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,429
...with flagrant disregard
for public safety...

314
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:14,830
...causing to be expended
some 1 200 rounds of ammunition.

315
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:21,006
Total damage to the shop: $ 76,81 3.''

316
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:25,703
Well, l know that you must be furious.

317
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,342
ln all my years as a police officer,
l have never seen such gross negligence.

318
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:39,124
-You men have anything to say?
-Sir, may l speak?

319
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:48,865
Captain Lassard, your brother taught
us many fine things at the academy.

320
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:53,565
He taught us that a cop can
never care too much or try too hard.

321
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,706
l don't know, sir.
That's exactly what we did.

322
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:04,042
-Perhaps we were a bit overzealous.
-Overzealous?

323
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:09,452
That's 1 200 rounds. $ 76,81 3.

324
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:15,791
lf caring is a crime
and trying is a felony...

325
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:18,625
...l guess we're all gonna plead guilty.

326
00:30:22,136 --> 00:30:25,867
Mauser, Mahoney is right.

327
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:32,075
lf your men tried as hard as these officers,
we'd gave this gang licked in no time.

328
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,713
Good work, men. Keep it up.

329
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:38,978
See you at the gym.

330
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:59,840
Attention! l need beer up here. Now!

331
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,878
Okay, look for specials now!
Come on! Shop, everybody!

332
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:08,948
-Shop! Shop!
-Safety first!

333
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:33,835
Come on! Yeah! Go for it!

334
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:42,407
What are you, a nut?
l'm a vegetarian!

335
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:47,480
Fruit Loops. They're mine!

336
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:59,893
Guys! Guys! Come on!
Stop, man! Act your age!

337
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:17,878
Bye, now.

338
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:25,558
Thank you very much. l found a lot
of really, really nice bargains here.

339
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,789
Excuse me, sir,
you forgot your stamps!

340
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,700
Gentlemen, l'd like
to propose a toast.

341
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:37,928
To Lieutenant Mauser.
No, no, no--

342
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:41,405
-Biggest putz of the precinct.
-All right.

343
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,308
Mahoney!

344
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,276
Get me another beer, will you?

345
00:32:52,286 --> 00:32:55,050
-ls he in trouble?
-Good question.

346
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,118
-Tack, what's up?
-l need to speak to you, Mahoney.

347
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:01,420
-Okay. What?
-lt's of a personal nature.

348
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:04,064
Oh, all right. All right. All right.

349
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,166
Let me buy you a drink, all right?

350
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:14,264
Art, can l have a beer
and milk with ice. Right?

351
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:17,468
-Okay. How about a shot?
-Yeah, that'll be fine.

352
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:19,409
So, what's up, Tack?

353
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:23,248
lt's Kirkland. My partner.

354
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:27,377
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're a lucky guy.
She's a fox.

355
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:30,251
-That's affirmative.
-Oh, yeah.

356
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,552
With regards to Kirkland....

357
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,528
Something you need?

358
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:39,623
With regards to Kirkland....

359
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:42,065
-What?
-Well, l....

360
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:44,294
-l think l'm....
-You think what?

361
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:47,464
-Well, l might....
-Tack, what? Spell it out.

362
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:51,309
Lincoln, Ocean, Victor, Edward.

363
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,676
Love? Eugene, you're in love!
You little devil!

364
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:59,115
You're in love. That's great!

365
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,312
Let's keep this 1 0-35, okay?

366
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:05,523
Of course, of course.
Between you and me.

367
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:08,753
You and Kirkland? So she have
the hots for you too?

368
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,454
l don't know.

369
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:15,129
l'm inexperienced in matters
of a romantic nature.

370
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:18,637
Tack, you've been with women before.

371
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,036
-Well, l--
-You've had one woman before.

372
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:24,474
-Well, not really.
-Come on. l've seen you walking with girls.

373
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,873
To be precise--

374
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,743
You're 28 years old.
You're a man of the world--

375
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,543
Mahoney, l'm a virgin!

376
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:40,058
Go about your business,
or l'll crack some heads!

377
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:44,462
-Proctor!
-Oh, lieutenant, l was looking for you.

378
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:48,432
l have the pictures of the fruits
drunk at the bar, like you asked.

379
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:53,336
The composition's a little off, but, sir,
you can clearly see those fruits are drunk.

380
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:58,172
Who asked for fruits drunk at a bar?
l asked for new recruits drunk at the bar.

381
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,177
Recruits?

382
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:04,548
Lieutenant, l majored in art.
l could put a uniform on this guy.

383
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,745
-lt would look like Hightower.
-What are you, losing it?

384
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:09,651
Just get me Mahoney.

385
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:13,021
-Should l save these?
-Get me Mahoney!

386
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,425
Look at this, look at this.
l got nothing here, l got nothing.

387
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:19,225
-Tack, would you mind? l got a life.
-Mahoney!

388
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,302
Lieutenant Mauser wants
to see you. Pronto!

389
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:34,309
Any day now, Mahoney,
and your little ass is mine.

390
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:36,541
You wanted to see me, sir?

391
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:39,079
Didn't your mother teach you
how to knock?

392
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:43,314
lt depends. Sir, l hope this isn't
gonna be too personal.

393
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:45,721
l heard what you said
about my little butt.

394
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,828
l don't know how to break this to you,
but l'm straight.

395
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,363
You know, you're very funny,
you know that, Mahoney?

396
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:56,435
Every year, we get a rookie
who thinks he's a comedian.

397
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:01,067
Well, Mr. Comedian...

398
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:03,306
...see if you think this is funny.

399
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,340
lt's your new assignment.

400
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,616
What are we supposed to be doing here?

401
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:21,728
ln case somebody's car stops...

402
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:24,330
...we save them from
carbon monoxide poisoning.

403
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:25,931
Who's gonna save us?

404
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:31,169
l guess it can get kind of boring, huh?

405
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,939
Hey, Lou! Lou, wanna play catch? Here!

406
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,839
Go get it. Go get it, Lou.

407
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,855
Lou!

408
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:52,889
Yeah. Good catch, Lou.

409
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:22,347
Excuse me?

410
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:28,119
-Could l use your restroom, please?
-You buying gas?

411
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:29,995
No.

412
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:32,596
Then pee somewheres else.

413
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:36,225
Look, this is a police emergency.

414
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,800
Okay. Take the key.

415
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:46,671
Hey, don't run away with that.

416
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:52,008
The key to forming a successful
citizen's watch group is communication.

417
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,245
l want you to think of this precinct...

418
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:57,414
...as the hub of a miniature
communications network...

419
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:03,860
...stretching from each of your homes
to every officer, on duty and very dirty.

420
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:10,561
-Lou, let's get something to eat.
-Anybody got any aspirin?

421
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:13,172
l've got a headache that's not gonna quit.

422
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,204
Oh, well, look at this, here.
lt's the Jones Boys.

423
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,974
Holy mackerel there, Mahoney.

424
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,941
What did you do, suck up a bus?

425
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,180
Lou, you don't like me,
and l'm not crazy about you.

426
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:34,083
Schtulman, you keep him away from me.

427
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:36,957
l'll be in the shower if you need me.

428
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:43,330
Hey, Mahoney, do me a favor.

429
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,338
Keep shaking this stuff
so l can fix my helmet.

430
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:49,533
-What did you do, crack it?
-Yeah, l gotta put that on it.

431
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,235
-Some sort of a glue?
-lt's epoxy resin.

432
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:56,306
-You mean, when it hardens, it--
-lt turns into plastic.

433
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:58,509
-How long does it take?
-A few seconds.

434
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:00,677
-How long does it last?
-A few years.

435
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,495
Hey.

436
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,531
Hey!

437
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,469
Hey! Wait a minute!

438
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:54,172
My hand got stuck to my head!
Hey, who's fooling around?

439
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:57,105
What the fuck? Okay.

440
00:39:57,278 --> 00:40:00,714
Okay. Let's not fool around, fellas.

441
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:02,781
lt's me, and l'm not kidding around.

442
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,818
l want someone to take this out of my hair!
ls that you, Schtulman?

443
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,251
l'm not kidding around!
Now, give me a hand.

444
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:15,059
That ain't funny. That's very childish.
All right, cut it out!

445
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,561
You're acting like children. Children!

446
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:21,326
Now, somebody, just pull my hands
out off my head now!

447
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,299
Who's in here?

448
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:27,236
Who's that? Who's that?
l'll remember that voice.

449
00:40:27,408 --> 00:40:29,672
lf l remember that voice,
you guys are dead.

450
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,177
Dead! D-E-A-D! Dead!
ls somebody here?

451
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,939
Okay, who is this?

452
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:36,879
All right, Lou. Oh, come on, Lou.

453
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,615
No, Lou, don't bite me there. Lou.

454
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:42,547
Lou. Please, Lou.

455
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:44,588
Lou, please. Lou.

456
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:47,056
Oh, no. Oh, no, Lou. Lou.
Good dog, Lou.

457
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,127
Oh, no! Oh, no, Lou! No, Lou!

458
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:57,329
All right. Open that door now!

459
00:40:57,505 --> 00:41:01,271
Hey, you. l'm not kidding here!

460
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,282
Well....

461
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:16,649
What's the matter, you never saw
a man wash his hair before?

462
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,057
Captain Lassard.

463
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,688
l'll be in my room if you need me.

464
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:26,198
Proctor!

465
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,828
Proctor!

466
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,038
-Oh, this is gonna be just fine.
-Yeah?

467
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:35,004
Wait, one snip here.
Let me get by the thumb.

468
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:39,578
-Yeah?
-Oh, that's-- That looks very natural.

469
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,544
-Looks okay?
-lt's very, very good.

470
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:44,582
l don't think you'll be able
to tell the difference.

471
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,812
l'll bet you anything it was Mahoney
responsible for this.

472
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:51,082
After l'm through,
just let me shape this a little bit...

473
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:55,319
...and l think you're gonna really be
happy with what we've got here.

474
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:57,225
-Yeah? Let me see it.
-Sure.

475
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:59,127
Okay.

476
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:04,395
Just look at it in the back here.
Look at it over here.

477
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:06,904
Could l have the mirror, please?

478
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:08,906
Sure.

479
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:13,437
Lieutenant?

480
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:16,548
Sir?

481
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:22,712
No, no, no. We'll get a wig.

482
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,950
Have you seen the state-of-the-art
in wigs today, sir?

483
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,219
What the hell are you talking about?

484
00:42:28,395 --> 00:42:30,386
What am l gonna do about this?

485
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:48,343
-Hey, what you doing?
-Leave me alone, lady, please?

486
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,582
Well....

487
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:03,329
This is just what l've been looking for.

488
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:08,632
-l'm not afraid of you punks.
-Come on, man. Come on!

489
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:11,833
-Right here.
-Where are you going?

490
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,873
-l ain't going nowhere.
-Come on, l'll take you all on.

491
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:18,372
Come on, l want you.
l'm not afraid of a wallet thief.

492
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:20,536
-Now it's just you and me.
-You and me.

493
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:22,477
Okay, come on. Come on.

494
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,880
Come on. l'm tired of talking
to you, punk.

495
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:27,612
l wanna dance.
l wanna get my hands on you.

496
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:30,780
Yeah. You ready to talk to me now?
Come on. Show me.

497
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:32,919
Teach me.

498
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:36,420
Okay, one at a time.
Put me down!

499
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:40,363
-Come on, put me down.
-Oh, we'll put you down, all right.

500
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:43,466
At this point in time...

501
00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:47,198
...yours truly was the object
of a malicious prank.

502
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:50,206
Now...

503
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:54,370
...can anybody in here
tell me how this happened?

504
00:43:54,815 --> 00:43:57,909
l can, sir. And if you don't stop that,
you could go blind.

505
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:03,555
You think that's funny,
don't you, Mahoney?

506
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:06,453
Well, you're on report.
Put him on report.

507
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:12,626
We are not gonna leave this room
until we find out what happened.

508
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,200
-What happened?
-What's going on here?

509
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:17,599
Nothing. l was just reprimanding the men.

510
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:20,535
-To hell with your reprimands.
-You don't understand.

511
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:24,474
-Shut up, l have something to say.
-Would you take a look at my hands?

512
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:29,606
l think that's a matter of personal hygiene.
l am talking about public safety.

513
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,815
Now listen up, everybody.
This is serious.

514
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:37,546
We've gotta do something.

515
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:40,785
This is war! Now, we didn't start it...

516
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:43,259
...but we are going to finish it.

517
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,762
l don't care if we work time and a half...

518
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,458
...l don't care if we have
to work double time...

519
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:52,765
...but mark my words, we are gonna
nail these punks, starting now!

520
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,465
-We can get them!
-Yeah!

521
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:57,041
Let's kick ass!

522
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:00,843
-Freeze!
-Freeze!

523
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,847
Cuff them.

524
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,814
l can't. l forgot my cuffs.
They're on the bike.

525
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:09,046
No problem.

526
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:22,666
Hey, hey. Excuse me. l hate to interrupt,
but can l go to the wedding?

527
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:26,499
l mean, l've got a gift.
Look. Remote. Huh?

528
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:35,878
Excuse me.

529
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,544
-l don't think you should be doing that.
-What you gonna do about it?

530
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:45,820
-l have to arrest you or something.
-You don't wanna use that.

531
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,858
Look, l'm serious. That's my--

532
00:45:48,028 --> 00:45:50,360
Oh, l'm sorry.

533
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:52,425
Oh, l didn't know--

534
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,707
-Zed don't like when you miss payments.
-You're late.

535
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:14,011
Hey!

536
00:46:14,822 --> 00:46:16,346
That's my greengrocer.

537
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,214
Walk your beat, cop.

538
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:53,793
-He thinks he's Bruce Lee.
-You wanna bet?

539
00:46:55,762 --> 00:46:57,161
Damn you.

540
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:59,026
Wanna fight, huh?

541
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:01,562
Fight me!

542
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,608
He's very good.

543
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,247
l like this.

544
00:47:41,074 --> 00:47:43,338
Oh! Not on broccoli!

545
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:03,690
Oh! Not on cauliflower!

546
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,497
-Hey, hey.
-Sweetchuck!

547
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,667
Where you going, man?

548
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,705
Come on, mother.

549
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,211
Come on! Come on back here, man!

550
00:48:31,124 --> 00:48:33,718
-Come on, he ran in here!
-We got him surrounded!

551
00:48:37,264 --> 00:48:38,925
Hey.

552
00:48:43,704 --> 00:48:45,865
Right. Okay, okay.
We'll be right there.

553
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:50,135
There's a huge fight at the Blue Oyster Bar.
Should we send the SWAT team?

554
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,302
No. You send Mahoney in.

555
00:48:53,814 --> 00:48:57,375
M-1 5, a 41 5 in progress
at the Blue Oyster Bar.

556
00:48:57,551 --> 00:49:00,213
-Blue Oyster?
-l'll get the address. Wait a minute.

557
00:49:00,387 --> 00:49:04,118
-The Blue Oyster Bar is--
-621 Cowan Avenue.

558
00:49:31,284 --> 00:49:32,945
l'm going in.

559
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:38,357
Coming out!

560
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:44,192
Hey, Hightower.

561
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:49,993
Looks pretty bad in there.

562
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:51,599
l'm going in.

563
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:54,366
Oh, no, no, no.
Hightower, don't go in there.

564
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:57,601
He's gonna get himself killed. Hightower!

565
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,512
Put these in the truck.
l'll be right back.

566
00:50:08,488 --> 00:50:09,853
He'll be right back.

567
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:17,327
You have the right to remain silent.
The right to a court-appointed attorney.

568
00:50:17,497 --> 00:50:21,092
You have the right to sing the blues.
You have the right to cable TV.

569
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,826
You have the right to sublet.

570
00:50:23,003 --> 00:50:25,801
You have the right to paint the walls.
No loud colors.

571
00:50:25,972 --> 00:50:28,304
Hightower. Thanks a lot, man.

572
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,103
Anytime.

573
00:50:36,249 --> 00:50:38,308
Y'all be good, now.

574
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,521
Excuse me. Could l have
your signature for this?

575
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:56,692
-Sure. What do you got?
-Authorization for a body cavity search.

576
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:01,136
Listen, each and every one of you men,
and you too, of course...

577
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,139
...deserve real congratulations.

578
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,609
That's a damn fine piece
of police work. Really.

579
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,044
l think you'll feel the difference today.

580
00:51:09,216 --> 00:51:11,684
The whole neighborhood
is excited about this.

581
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:13,410
Really. Proctor!

582
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:15,578
l tell you, when this watch is over...

583
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:18,247
...we'll go to the Club & Cuff.
Drinks on me.

584
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:20,723
Captain, Chief Hurst is on the phone.

585
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:25,597
-We'll leave you alone, sir.
-No, no, no. This is for you too, huh?

586
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:29,435
Lassard.

587
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:31,597
Yes, sir.

588
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,202
Forty-two arrests, sir. Yes.

589
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:40,376
Well, l told you these young recruits
could take care of the job, sir.

590
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,948
Here comes Mauser with more good news.
Can you hold on?

591
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:47,479
l'm afraid we had to drop
most of the charges.

592
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:50,452
lt appears we had to drop
most of the charges?

593
00:51:50,624 --> 00:51:52,216
lmproper arrest procedures.

594
00:51:52,392 --> 00:51:55,884
-Unnecessary use of force, sir.
-''Unnecessary use of force''?

595
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:58,121
We had to release the prisoners.

596
00:51:58,298 --> 00:52:01,790
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
Will there be anything else?

597
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:04,801
No, l just wanna be alone.

598
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,806
Unnecessary use of force?!

599
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:13,434
What are they talking about?
How are they supposed to do the job?

600
00:52:17,317 --> 00:52:18,841
Mahoney.

601
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,819
Mauser...

602
00:52:20,987 --> 00:52:22,887
...l know what you're doing.

603
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:28,589
Then you better be nice to me, huh?
Because l'm gonna be in charge here soon.

604
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:46,039
Yeah, l'll get to that later.

605
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:51,944
l'm all right.

606
00:52:53,186 --> 00:52:54,744
l'm trying.

607
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:02,358
Tack!

608
00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:05,464
Tack, why all dressed up?
You look great.

609
00:53:05,632 --> 00:53:07,793
-l got a date with Kirkland.
-You little--

610
00:53:07,968 --> 00:53:11,062
Your first date, huh?
Good going, good going.

611
00:53:11,238 --> 00:53:14,799
-What you got there, cologne?
-No. lt's gun oil.

612
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,046
-Where's Mahoney?
-Here.

613
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,951
Hey, Mahoney? Somebody here to see you.

614
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,349
-You Mahoney?
-Yeah.

615
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:31,319
-l'm here for the BCS.
-BCS?

616
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:34,554
-Body cavity search.
-Oh, right, right, right.

617
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:36,559
Where is he?

618
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:43,632
Everybody out.

619
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,430
Let's get out of here.

620
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:51,406
What are you doing?
Wait a minute!

621
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:55,043
-Shut him up.
-What are you doing?

622
00:53:55,882 --> 00:53:58,715
Now, just relax, and we'll get along fine.

623
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:02,278
We'll talk later.

624
00:54:22,709 --> 00:54:24,074
Hello, Tackleberry.

625
00:54:24,744 --> 00:54:26,371
Kirkland.

626
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:31,011
You look very nice.

627
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:35,349
Permit me to respond in kind.

628
00:54:35,722 --> 00:54:38,452
l've never seen you
in civilian attire before.

629
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,388
-Disappointed?
-Oh, negative.

630
00:54:41,795 --> 00:54:44,457
-And you?
-Oh, no.

631
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:55,406
Well, almost 1 900 hours.
Guess we better go.

632
00:54:55,575 --> 00:54:57,042
Right.

633
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:00,944
Here.

634
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,943
What's this?

635
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:07,051
They're ear cuffs.
l had them made just for you.

636
00:55:09,956 --> 00:55:11,321
Gift.

637
00:55:50,296 --> 00:55:52,355
Good night, Tackleberry.

638
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:55,431
Good night, Kirkland.

639
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:00,931
-Tackleberry?
-Yes?

640
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,640
l love you.

641
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:06,809
Ditto.

642
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,654
-Oh, Eugene.
-Oh, Kathleen.

643
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:36,700
Eugene.

644
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:18,884
Oh, Eugene!

645
00:57:25,959 --> 00:57:27,483
Good evening.

646
00:57:31,998 --> 00:57:34,398
Oh, excuse, please.

647
00:57:44,477 --> 00:57:46,945
Happy birthday, Pete.

648
00:57:47,447 --> 00:57:49,938
lt's not my birthday, Eric.

649
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,582
ls all that crap necessary?

650
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,218
-You seem a little edgy, Pete.
-No, l'm fine.

651
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,829
You want chopstick or fork?

652
00:58:04,998 --> 00:58:06,898
How are things at work?

653
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:09,028
Awful.

654
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,337
lf l don't do something quick,
l'm out of a job.

655
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:14,496
They're saying l'm too old.

656
00:58:14,674 --> 00:58:16,904
They're saying l'm losing it.

657
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,671
They're saying that l'm paranoid.

658
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,245
They're all out to get me, Eric.

659
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,475
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

660
00:58:25,785 --> 00:58:27,878
Try to relax.

661
00:58:29,055 --> 00:58:31,580
l'm sorry. lt's just the strain, that's all.

662
00:58:32,525 --> 00:58:35,016
You stupid bastard!

663
00:58:35,195 --> 00:58:36,719
Excuse me.

664
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:40,423
Why are you doing this to me?

665
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:42,332
-Who?
-You!

666
00:58:42,635 --> 00:58:45,536
And those rookies you sent me.

667
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:48,572
All they can do is screw up.

668
00:58:48,741 --> 00:58:54,202
Now the neighborhood is turning against us.
They're coming at me from all directions.

669
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,677
That would be normal.

670
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:58,941
Why don't you do something?

671
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,019
-Like what?
-Well...

672
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:05,180
...something to reassure the neighborhood.

673
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:09,825
A special show of police involvement
for the neighborhood.

674
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:12,490
A street fair.

675
00:59:14,534 --> 00:59:16,297
A street fair.

676
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:21,306
Eric, that's a brilliant idea.

677
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:24,335
What's a big brother for?

678
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:34,350
-This fish is boiling.
-Oh, you want stir-fry?

679
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:50,635
Step right up! lt's so simple
even a quarterback can do it.

680
00:59:50,803 --> 00:59:52,532
-You look like a quarterback.
-Me?

681
00:59:52,705 --> 00:59:54,138
-Yeah.
-Could you hold this?

682
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:56,275
l'll hold your cotton candy. Come on.

683
00:59:56,442 --> 00:59:58,467
l know you can do it. Come on.

684
00:59:58,645 --> 01:00:00,840
Get it up on your shoulder.

685
01:00:17,563 --> 01:00:19,963
Thank you, Mrs. Mayor.

686
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:24,092
Now, this broom is just a symbol
of the new spirit...

687
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:28,229
...that's sweeping across
our neighborhood.

688
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:37,483
And so, Mrs. Mayor,
perhaps you'll join with me...

689
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:41,711
...in sweeping the crime
off our streets for good.

690
01:00:49,762 --> 01:00:54,961
-What's going on here?
-Cops are having a fair.

691
01:00:56,002 --> 01:00:58,266
-What for?
-They're trying to raise money...

692
01:00:58,438 --> 01:01:01,066
...to clean up the neighborhood.

693
01:01:02,942 --> 01:01:04,466
That's awful nice of them.

694
01:01:04,644 --> 01:01:07,442
Are they gonna have games
and prizes and rides?

695
01:01:07,613 --> 01:01:10,081
Yeah!

696
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:15,585
-Are they gonna have a Ferris wheel?
-They got a big one.

697
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,656
l hate Ferris wheels!

698
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:23,721
l got a bad stomach. They make me sick.

699
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:27,195
-You don't have to ride on it.
-No!

700
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:33,431
-Well, l'll go on it if you go on with me.
-Okay.

701
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:36,937
Let's go have some fun.

702
01:01:59,098 --> 01:02:00,998
lt's mayhem.

703
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,647
-Hi, are you the mayor?
-Yes. Yes, l am.

704
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,718
-l voted for you.
-Oh, that was very nice of you.

705
01:02:20,953 --> 01:02:25,583
-l know when l'm whipped.
-Sir, that's not like you.

706
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:29,023
-Who's taking over? Don't tell me.
-Mahoney.

707
01:02:29,195 --> 01:02:32,892
Captain Mauser wants to see you
in the squad room. Now.

708
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:41,872
From this moment on, l am the de facto
commander of this precinct.

709
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:50,179
My name is Captain Mauser. Captain.

710
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:54,183
On Thursday last...

711
01:02:54,353 --> 01:03:00,292
...yours truly was the object
of a disgusting personal attack.

712
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:07,432
And l would like to have some names.

713
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,534
Just some names.

714
01:03:14,841 --> 01:03:16,604
Okay.

715
01:03:16,776 --> 01:03:22,908
Have it your way. But l will suspend
every single one of you!

716
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,785
Sir.

717
01:03:29,355 --> 01:03:30,617
l did it.

718
01:03:36,028 --> 01:03:38,087
Mahoney.

719
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,627
Mahoney?

720
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,794
-What kind of clown do you think l am?
-A juggling clown?

721
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:49,503
-You're suspended. lndefinitely! Sit down!
-You can't do that.

722
01:03:49,675 --> 01:03:53,839
-You suspend him, you suspend me.
-My pleasure.

723
01:03:54,013 --> 01:03:55,981
Sit down, smelly.

724
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,480
We don't know where they come from,
where they hide out.

725
01:03:59,652 --> 01:04:02,746
We don't even know who their leader is.

726
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:07,625
-God, would l like to nail that bunch.
-l would love to get my job back.

727
01:04:08,294 --> 01:04:12,253
l say we do what Baretta would do.

728
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,830
Baretta?

729
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,566
-What?
-Go undercover.

730
01:04:17,737 --> 01:04:20,433
lnfiltrate the gang. Get their confidence.

731
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:24,906
-Schtulman.
-You think you could do that?

732
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,243
No.

733
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,979
But he could.

734
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,056
-He's right.
-No.

735
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:40,590
You're young enough.

736
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,456
Hell, you even look like
one of the little creeps.

737
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:47,156
-He's talking about a television show.
-Mahoney, here's the deal.

738
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:50,894
Now, l can't pay you a salary,
can't even give you expenses.

739
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:55,964
lf you get yourself in a jam,
l might not be able to bail you out.

740
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,542
-Could be dangerous.
-You could get killed.

741
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:00,976
He's right.

742
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:07,042
Sounds awfully tempting.

743
01:05:50,596 --> 01:05:55,465
Get out of there!
He'll call you back!

744
01:05:58,804 --> 01:06:01,830
l said, he'll call you back!

745
01:06:03,009 --> 01:06:05,534
Hey, man! Hey, man, what you doing?

746
01:06:07,246 --> 01:06:09,339
-Nothing.
-Why'd you mess up the phone?

747
01:06:09,515 --> 01:06:12,313
l felt like it. Don't sit so close!

748
01:06:12,485 --> 01:06:15,818
-l'm Flacko. This is my man Mojo.
-What do they call you, man?

749
01:06:15,988 --> 01:06:19,685
-Jughead! Jughead!
-Me and Mojo, we're with the Scullions.

750
01:06:19,859 --> 01:06:22,419
-Who do you run with?
-The Archies. The Archies.

751
01:06:22,595 --> 01:06:26,531
-l ain't never heard of no Archies.
-Used to be the Fudpuckers.

752
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,499
-Oh, yeah. l think l know some Fudpuckers.
-Don't press your luck!

753
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:33,104
-Hey, you should be with us.
-Oh, yeah? Why?

754
01:06:33,272 --> 01:06:35,740
-Because we the baddest.
-You the baddest.

755
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:39,275
-How do l get to be a Scallion?
-Scullion, not Scallion.

756
01:06:39,445 --> 01:06:42,846
What's the difference?
You're lucky you're sitting with me.

757
01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:44,949
Don't worry, man. We get you in.

758
01:06:45,117 --> 01:06:48,450
Here comes the Man.
Watch your feet, he's gonna run them over.

759
01:06:53,693 --> 01:06:56,059
Well, my, my.

760
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:59,456
Hello, there.
What are you boys up to, huh?

761
01:07:00,499 --> 01:07:02,763
Know anything about
destruction of property?

762
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:06,462
-Man, we ain't done nothing.
-Oh, you ain't? Oh, my, look at that.

763
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:11,269
Put them against the wall. You too, chico.
Come on, get over there! Spread your legs!

764
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,309
Come on!

765
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:16,813
What do you think you're doing?
Come on! Spread them!

766
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:21,352
Don't move! Don't move! Shut up!
Get out of the car.

767
01:07:22,988 --> 01:07:27,152
Come over here. Toss out your gun.
Now we're gonna have a little fun.

768
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:31,353
Know what l mean? A little fun.
Now you spread them. You spread them.

769
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:36,029
Now kick him. Yeah, kick him.

770
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:38,966
You like that? Kick him again. And harder.

771
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:44,699
-You're crazy.
-You like that? Hold it, hold it. Hey, Jones.

772
01:07:44,877 --> 01:07:49,075
That's it, that's it, that's it. All right.
Now get away from the car.

773
01:07:49,248 --> 01:07:50,840
Get away from the car.

774
01:07:51,016 --> 01:07:55,851
Who's this guy? This guy giving us lip?
Maybe we should give him a little lip.

775
01:07:57,089 --> 01:07:59,216
You like that? How about some more?

776
01:08:01,694 --> 01:08:04,390
Hey, get out of here. Get out of here.

777
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,626
Hope you're all right, sir.
What do you think?

778
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,268
Beautiful, baby.

779
01:08:12,037 --> 01:08:16,736
-There's the little girl. Come on, June.
-This is my big little brother Bud.

780
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:19,173
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, Bud.

781
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,903
-Hi, little girl.
-Oh, Daddy!

782
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,483
-So you're gonna leave Daddy, huh?
-This is Eugene.

783
01:08:25,651 --> 01:08:27,551
Hi, Tackleberry.

784
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,985
-Good grip.
-l better check the roast.

785
01:08:31,157 --> 01:08:34,126
Yeah, check the roast, sweetheart!

786
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,654
Hey, come on. Sit down.

787
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:44,701
My little girl here tells me
that you're into self-defense.

788
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,839
-That's quite correct, sir.
-Yeah, well...

789
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:51,807
...l was in the South Pacific back in '44,
in the Seabees.

790
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:56,110
Daddy was middleweight champion
in the Seabees.

791
01:08:56,382 --> 01:09:00,045
l used to be pretty good at boxing,
but my boy is pretty good too.

792
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,188
He was on the high school
championship team.

793
01:09:03,355 --> 01:09:06,882
-But l can still take him, right?
-l don't know, Dad. Take it easy.

794
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,924
-Come on!
-l don't think so, Dad.

795
01:09:09,094 --> 01:09:11,654
Come on. Come on.

796
01:09:12,264 --> 01:09:15,961
-Oh, you all right, Dad?
-Hey, pretty good, huh?

797
01:09:18,604 --> 01:09:21,937
-l'm sorry, kid, huh? lt's all right, huh?
-lt's all right.

798
01:09:22,675 --> 01:09:23,937
Good!

799
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:39,517
-Are you all right?
-Good, huh? That was....

800
01:09:42,294 --> 01:09:47,926
You boys stop that foolishness
and come to the table. Dinner's ready!

801
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:52,560
When these two start at it,
they're just a couple of kids.

802
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:56,572
What do you say?
Go have some chow, huh?

803
01:09:56,742 --> 01:09:58,004
Aren't they sweet?

804
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:01,337
Captain, if you could tape this on him
as high as you can.

805
01:10:01,513 --> 01:10:04,107
-Where did you get this thing?
-l built it.

806
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:08,583
-Why does it say ''Mr. Microphone''?
-lt's okay. l made a few modifications.

807
01:10:08,754 --> 01:10:13,020
All right, okay. Sir!
Sir, it's a little tight.

808
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:16,492
Sorry. Okay, hold on.

809
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:22,999
Now, look. Tonight, they're taking me to
meet the leader of the gang, the head guy.

810
01:10:23,535 --> 01:10:27,403
That's good. As long as this is on,
we'll hear every word, right?

811
01:10:27,573 --> 01:10:29,905
-Right.
-Do me a favor, and yourself.

812
01:10:30,075 --> 01:10:33,772
Just try to drop a hint now and then
as to where you are...

813
01:10:33,946 --> 01:10:36,847
...so we can sort of keep track
of you, okay?

814
01:10:37,016 --> 01:10:38,608
-Sir?
-Yeah.

815
01:10:38,784 --> 01:10:42,811
-You sure this is gonna work?
-Will you stop worrying?

816
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:46,653
Mumphrey swings. And it's a home run!

817
01:10:49,628 --> 01:10:52,529
Does that every once in a while.
Just give it a tap.

818
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,760
-Hey!
-All right.

819
01:10:56,936 --> 01:11:00,497
All right. Hey, it's your shot. Sorry.

820
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:04,200
-Hey, hey, great car. Where'd you buy it?
-Get in.

821
01:11:04,376 --> 01:11:05,707
-All right.
-ln the back.

822
01:11:05,878 --> 01:11:08,813
-ln the back.
-Come on, let's go.

823
01:11:16,121 --> 01:11:20,080
-Hey, man, it's hot. Take off your coat.
-No, no, no. l'm fine. l'm fine.

824
01:11:20,259 --> 01:11:24,457
-I like hot.
-Damn. Damn!

825
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:27,758
-Where we going?
-That's for me to know and you to find out.

826
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:30,424
Right, right. I guess Flacko's right. Right.

827
01:11:30,602 --> 01:11:32,536
-Wait until you meet Zed.
-Zed?

828
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,673
-Yeah, he's the man.
-He's bad.

829
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,307
Hey, he's the best.

830
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,572
-Mahoney, talk to me.
-Sir, he can't hear you.

831
01:11:40,746 --> 01:11:42,941
l know that, Schtulman.

832
01:11:43,315 --> 01:11:48,651
Hey, are we going south?
Because l got a lot of enemies down South.

833
01:11:51,423 --> 01:11:53,584
Yeah, man. Yeah, man.

834
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:57,058
I like it, man. I like it.
I don't know where I am. I like it.

835
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:17,944
Yo, we got a friend. A friend.

836
01:12:18,984 --> 01:12:21,452
All right, all right.

837
01:12:22,654 --> 01:12:26,283
l like it. l like it. You know what l mean?
l like it. All right.

838
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:29,655
-What is this place?
-Used to be where they kept the bears.

839
01:12:29,828 --> 01:12:32,820
Oh, yeah? Well, where are the bears?

840
01:12:33,565 --> 01:12:37,729
Yeah, right. Bears. Maybe l should
go home, get something to eat.

841
01:12:37,903 --> 01:12:41,202
Oh, hi, fella. Hi, nice to see you.
Nice shades. Nice shades.

842
01:12:41,373 --> 01:12:43,034
Oh, nice bridge. Little shaky.

843
01:12:50,983 --> 01:12:53,508
Hey, l like this place. l really like it.

844
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:58,154
-He's home.
-Yeah, home. l like it, l like it.

845
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:02,326
Lot of big steps, lot of graffiti on the wall.
A cavelike atmosphere.

846
01:13:02,494 --> 01:13:05,292
Just like The Flintstones.
Where's Fred and Wilma?

847
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,432
-He's cool.
-Where you been all my life?

848
01:13:07,599 --> 01:13:11,797
Don't get fresh. Maybe later.

849
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,562
l'm in trouble.

850
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:17,732
What a place! Looks like a flea market.
l went shopping yesterday.

851
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:20,743
We got the same barber.
You get a headache from that?

852
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:26,944
You'll be awfully lonely sleeping without
Mrs. Beasley.

853
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:29,110
-I know.
-Zed?

854
01:13:29,288 --> 01:13:33,156
-l'm watching Family Affair.
-Zed.

855
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:36,590
lt's a rerun. What do you want?

856
01:13:36,762 --> 01:13:42,792
-l think he'd be a good Scullion.
-You don't think, Flacko. You ask!

857
01:13:42,968 --> 01:13:46,665
-You got a name? What do they call you?
-Jughead.

858
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:51,539
Jughead. My mother's name
was Jughead.

859
01:13:51,944 --> 01:13:56,677
-Well, l've been thinking of changing it.
-Why? lt's a good American name.

860
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,874
As such!

861
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:03,085
Right, right, right. Yeah, nice place.
Great place.

862
01:14:03,489 --> 01:14:08,256
Thank you very much. l had a woman who
used to come in here about once a week...

863
01:14:08,427 --> 01:14:11,055
...but l had to fire her. lt didn't pan out.

864
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:13,630
-Oh, really? l might know someone.
-Shut up!

865
01:14:13,799 --> 01:14:17,758
-l don't know anyone. Not a person.
-What are you so nervous about?

866
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:21,599
l don't know. l don't know. l don't know.
The place weirds me out.

867
01:14:21,773 --> 01:14:25,800
-It smells like animals.
-They took him to my place?

868
01:14:25,978 --> 01:14:27,343
-Where are we?
-The old zoo.

869
01:14:27,513 --> 01:14:29,037
The old zoo!

870
01:14:30,616 --> 01:14:35,576
The old zoo. The old--
Not the new zoo, but the old zoo.

871
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:38,086
You have a cigarette? Some smokes?

872
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:40,020
-The old zoo.
-The old zoo?

873
01:14:40,192 --> 01:14:44,253
-l never even saw the new zoo.
-Well, now's your chance, Schtulman.

874
01:14:44,429 --> 01:14:49,264
Lou may love it. lt'll be like a new home.
Turn the wheel!

875
01:14:52,638 --> 01:14:55,664
What about a light?
What about some little fire?

876
01:14:58,177 --> 01:15:00,611
You shouldn't smoke.
lt's bad for your health.

877
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,648
-Think l'll quit.
-Sunday, Sunday at Raceway Park.

878
01:15:04,816 --> 01:15:09,185
-Dragsters--
-You're wired!

879
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:13,546
-You're a cop.
-No, no, no. l'm a singer.

880
01:15:15,861 --> 01:15:18,056
You're a cop.

881
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:21,595
And you're an ugly cop.

882
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:26,427
Attention all units. Attention all units.
We've got a 997 at the old zoo.

883
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,972
-997?
-We've got a 997 at the old zoo.

884
01:15:30,142 --> 01:15:33,111
A 997 at the old zoo.
Mahoney needs help.

885
01:15:33,645 --> 01:15:38,378
Step on it, please. Not you, Lou!

886
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:41,610
All units. We have a 997
at the old abandoned zoo!

887
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,620
-What are you doing?
-l was calling for assistance.

888
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,055
-Mahoney's in trouble.
-Mahoney is suspended.

889
01:15:48,227 --> 01:15:51,060
You will do nothing of the kind.

890
01:15:52,364 --> 01:15:54,332
Hurry! Hurry! Mahoney's in trouble!

891
01:15:54,499 --> 01:15:57,559
-Mahoney!
-Let's go!

892
01:16:01,206 --> 01:16:03,436
-What's up?
-Mahoney's in trouble.

893
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:05,577
-Let me drive.
-Will you get in!

894
01:16:05,744 --> 01:16:08,872
Hey! Wait a minute!

895
01:16:09,448 --> 01:16:11,541
Wait a minute!

896
01:16:11,717 --> 01:16:16,051
-Don't make me flare my nostrils!
-Excuse me, Zed. Look, relax.

897
01:16:16,221 --> 01:16:18,917
You gotta calm down.
You gotta breathe with me.

898
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:22,288
-One, two, three.
-l'm getting too much caffeine.

899
01:16:22,461 --> 01:16:26,397
-Yeah, l know. l'm gonna go now.
-l ought to kill you!

900
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,132
-Hightower.
-Yes, sir?

901
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,928
l want you and Jones to cross that bridge.

902
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:34,561
Wait outside this entrance until
you hear my signal. Get going.

903
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,731
No going.

904
01:16:36,908 --> 01:16:40,435
Well, well, well.

905
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:44,438
lf it isn't the former captain...

906
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,978
...Pete Lassard.

907
01:16:49,488 --> 01:16:54,892
-What the hell do you think you're doing?
-l'm making a plan of attack.

908
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:59,326
Now, there's an air vent on top
of that cave. l'll be going in through there.

909
01:16:59,498 --> 01:17:02,899
Like hell you are. l'm in charge here.

910
01:17:03,068 --> 01:17:04,865
-Fackler.
-Yes, sir.

911
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,870
-You'll come with me.
-Where?

912
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,235
To the air vent.

913
01:17:11,943 --> 01:17:13,467
Captain Mauser.

914
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,587
-We're gonna do this my way.
-l'm not gonna move my elbow.

-l'm gonna lower you down real gently.

This is the police department.

942
01:20:03,582 --> 01:20:07,643
Throw down your weapons, put up
your hands and come out of this cave.

943
01:20:09,821 --> 01:20:12,255
-Hi, boys.

-So where are you from?
-Drop the gun, punk!

948
01:20:54,032 --> 01:20:56,523
You won't shoot!
You don't have any guts!

949
01:20:56,701 --> 01:20:59,261
Three more seconds,
you don't have any brains.

950

-Good job, sir!
-Thanks, Mahoney. Pick up the gun.

954
01:21:19,925 --> 01:21:21,552
That didn't hurt.

955
01:21:22,193 --> 01:21:24,354
That didn't hurt.

956
01:21:24,563 --> 01:21:26,963
That didn't hurt.

957

-That hurt!
-Don't move, dirtbag!

958
01:21:30,902 --> 01:21:32,733
Where you been, Hooks?

Haven't carried live ammo since '73.

961
01:22:06,237 --> 01:22:08,865
Welcome back, captain.

-Hi, commandant.
-Mahoney, how are you?

969
