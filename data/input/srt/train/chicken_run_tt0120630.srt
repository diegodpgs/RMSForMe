1
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,959
Shush!

2
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,797
I'm stuck!

3
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,835
Get back.

4
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:48,072
Hmm!

5
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:23,751
- Mr. Tweedy.
- Eh?

6
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,464
What is that chicken
doing outside the fence?

7
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,501
Oh! I don't know, love. L...

8
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:33,503
Just deal with it. Now!

9
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:43,940
I'll teach you to make a fool out of me.

10
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:51,558
Now let that be a
lesson to the lot of ya!

11
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:54,779
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!

12
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:33,996
Oh!

13
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:08,817
Morning, Ginger. Back from holiday?

14
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:10,834
I wasn't on holiday, Babs.

15
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:12,782
I was in solitary confinement.

16
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,775
Oh, it's nice to get a bit
of time to yourself, isn't it?

17
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:22,735
Roll call!

18
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:24,739
Come along now. You'll
be late for parade.

19
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:28,058
Pip, pip. Quick march.
Left, right, left, right!

20
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:31,452
- Come on. Smarten up.
- Ooh!

21
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:33,337
Discipline! Order!

22
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:37,132
Back in my R.A.F. Days when the
senior officer called for a scramble,

23
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,390
You'd hop in the old crate and tallyho.

24
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,615
Chocks away!

25
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,449
Give over, you old fool.
They just want to count us.

26
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,654
Oh, how dare you talk back
to a senior ranking officer.

27
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:50,488
- Why, back in my R.A.F. Days...
- Fowler, they're coming. Back in line.

28
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:53,972
- Oh, right, right.
- Oh!

29
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,767
There will be a stern reprimand
for you, lad. You're grounded.

30
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:02,685
Attention!

31
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:09,563
Welcome back, hen. Is there a new plan?

32
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,040
I thought we tried goin' under.

33
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:31,800
Ah! Over. Right.

34
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:43,201
How's the egg count?

35
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:46,136
I've laid five eggs this morning. Five!

36
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:49,036
- Well-Chuffed with that, I was...
- Shush!

37
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:59,434
Oh, no. Edwina.

38
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,398
Bunty, why didn't you
give her some of yours?

39
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:07,232
I would have. She didn't tell
me. She didn't tell anyone.

40
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,188
Oh, is Edwina off on holiday?

41
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:17,936
We've got to get out of here.

42
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:20,933
Ginger! Are we still on?

43
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,860
Oh, we're on, all right.

44
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:27,655
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in hut 17.

45
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:51,490
Oh!

46
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,853
You called? Nick and...

47
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,688
- Fetcher.
- At your service.

48
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:06,405
Over here.

49
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:09,166
We need some more things.

50
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,750
Right you are, miss.

51
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:12,914
How about this quality
handcrafted tea set?

52
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:13,344
Uh, no.

53
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,370
- Or this lovely necklace and pendant?
- It's love...

54
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:16,904
Or this beautiful little number,

55
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:19,804
All the rage in the fashionable
chicken coops of Paris.

56
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,368
Simply pop it on like so,

57
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:24,522
And as the French hens say, "Voila!"

58
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:25,727
That's French.

59
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:29,521
That's two hats in one, miss.
For parties, for weddings.

60
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:34,081
Oh, but madame, this makes you
look like a vision, like a dream.

61
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,564
- Like a duck.
- No, thank you.

62
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:40,558
We're making this. We need
these things. Can you get them?

63
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:44,242
Oh, oh, oh, this is a big job, miss.

64
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:46,718
Oh, bigger than the others.
No, no. This is gonna cost.

65
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:49,562
Same as always. One bag of seed.

66
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,876
- You call this pay?
- It's chicken feed.

67
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,156
- What else could we give you?
- Eggs.

68
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:56,040
- Eggs?
- Eggs.

69
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:57,975
We can't give you our
eggs. They're too valuable.

70
00:11:58,076 --> 00:11:59,875
And so are we.

71
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:05,434
After you, Fetcher.

72
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:07,470
After I what?

73
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:09,473
- Move!
- Ooh!

74
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,795
Hmm.

75
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,956
Twenty-Two and nine.

76
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,990
Fourteen shillings and threepence.

77
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:26,989
Seven and sixpence times three.

78
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:28,954
Two and nine.

79
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:32,153
Fourpence halfpenny.

80
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:35,593
D
- Oh! Stupid, worthless creatures!

81
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:39,427
I'm sick and tired of
making minuscule profits.

82
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:53,744
Hmm.

83
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:00,002
Hmm!

84
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:02,346
Oh, yes.

85
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,582
Those chickens are up to something.

86
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,158
Quiet. I'm onto something.

87
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,664
They're organized. I know it.

88
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:12,019
- I said, quiet.
- That ginger one.

89
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,938
I reckon she's their leader.

90
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:16,024
- Mr. Tweedy!

91
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,698
I may finally have found a way to
make us some real money around here,

92
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,622
And what are you on about?

93
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:23,542
Ridiculous notions of escaping chickens.

94
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:27,376
- But... But...
- It's all in your head, Mr. Tweedy. Say it!

95
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:30,936
It's all in me head.
It's all in me head.

96
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:34,059
Now, you keep telling yourself that,

97
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:36,815
Because I don't want to
hear another word about it.

98
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,371
- Is that clear?
- Yes, love.

99
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:42,069
But you know that ginger one...

100
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:44,697
They're chickens, you dolt!

101
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:48,432
Apart from you, they're the most
stupid creatures on this planet.

102
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:52,131
They don't plot, they don't
scheme, and they are not organized!

103
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:57,295
- Order! Order!

104
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,129
- Quiet, everyone. Settle down.

105
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:05,328
I would like to call to order...
Please, if you could just settle...

106
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:08,608
Let's have some discipline
in the ranks! What, what!

107
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:10,772
- Thank you, Fowler.
- In my R.A.F. Days,

108
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,646
We were never allowed to waste
time with unnecessary chitchat.

109
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:15,965
Yes, thank you, Fowler.

110
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,726
I...

111
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:23,644
Right!

112
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:28,367
Carry on.

113
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:32,203
Now, I know our last escape
attempt was a bit of a fiasco,

114
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:34,427
But Mac and I have come
up with a brand-New plan.

115
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:35,162
- Show 'em, Mac.
- Right.

116
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:36,861
We tried going under the
wire and that didn't work.

117
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,399
So, the plan is, we go over it.

118
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,340
- This is us, right?

119
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,765
We get in like this.

120
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,557
Wind her up and... let her go!

121
00:14:56,757 --> 00:15:00,556
Good grief! The turnip's bought it!

122
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:06,076
Farmer's coming!

123
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:13,393
Operation Cover-Up!

124
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:16,733
Whee!

125
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:19,793
Ouch!

126
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:26,830
Hmm.

127
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,830
Huh?

128
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,633
- Mr. Tweedy!
- Ooh. Ouch.

129
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:44,468
- Where are you?
- Ooh. It's all in your head.

130
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:48,346
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

131
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:53,225
Think, everyone, think.
What haven't we tried yet?

132
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,109
Uh...

133
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:57,584
We haven't tried not trying to escape.

134
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:59,821
Hmm. That might work.

135
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:01,988
What about Edwina?

136
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:05,747
How many more empty nests will it take?

137
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:09,582
Perhaps it wouldn't be empty if she'd spent
more time layin' and less time escapin'.

138
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,666
So laying eggs all your life...

139
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:15,181
And then getting plucked, stuffed
and roasted is good enough for you?

140
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:17,264
It's a livin'.

141
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:20,025
You know what the problem is?

142
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,859
The fences aren't just round the
farm. They're up here in your heads.

143
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:28,379
There's a better place out
there somewhere beyond that hill,

144
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:32,417
And it has wide open
spaces and lots of trees...

145
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:35,381
And grass.

146
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:39,216
Can you imagine that? Cool, green grass.

147
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:43,300
- Who feeds us?
- We feed ourselves.

148
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,539
- Well, where's the farm?
- There is no farm.

149
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:49,173
- Then where does the farmer live?
- There is no farmer, Babs.

150
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,772
- Is he on holiday?
- He isn't anywhere. Don't you get it?

151
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:56,691
There's no morning head count, no
farmers, no dogs and coops and keys...

152
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:59,617
And no fences.

153
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:03,451
In all my life I've never
heard such a fantastic...

154
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,653
Load of tripe!

155
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:09,734
Oh, face the facts, ducks.

156
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:13,568
The chances of us gettin' out
of here are a million to one.

157
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:17,646
Then there's still a chance.

158
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:40,727
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. What am I doing?

159
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:44,561
Who are you trying to fool?
You can't lead this bunch of...

160
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:49,001
Oh, heaven help us.

161
00:17:58,598 --> 00:18:02,038
Freedom!

162
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:05,477
Huh?

163
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:19,119
Whoa!

164
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:22,953
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You've been a wonderful audience.

165
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:27,513
- Ouch!
- Oh, yes.

166
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,993
That's it.

167
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:44,429
Get him inside quickly.

168
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:53,226
This is our way out of here.

169
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,991
We'll make posters?

170
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:58,825
No. What's on the poster, Babs.
What's on the poster. We'll fly out!

171
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:03,866
He must be very important to have his
picture taken. What do you suppose he does?

172
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,764
Isn't it obvious? He's a
professional flying rooster.

173
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,503
He flies from farm to
farm, giving demonstrations.

174
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:12,108
- Do you suppose?
- Oh, absolutely.

175
00:19:12,143 --> 00:19:14,342
Not in the dark, no.
No, not in there. No.

176
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:16,941
Get out. Good. Gotta get...

177
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:24,619
Who are you? Where
am I? What's goin' on?

178
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,737
Ouch! What happened to my wing?

179
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:28,784
You took a rather nasty fall.

180
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,299
And sprained the anterior tendon
connecting your radius to your humerus.

181
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,183
I gave it a wee bit of a tweak,
Jimmy, and wrapped her up.

182
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:34,778
Was that English?

183
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,337
She said you sprained
your wing. She fixed it.

184
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:40,097
- I made the bandage.
- I-I carried you in.

185
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:42,861
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Whoa.

186
00:19:42,896 --> 00:19:46,656
Let's back up and start
from the top. Where am I?

187
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,895
You're right. How rude of
us. We're just very excit...

188
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,891
This is a chicken farm.

189
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,819
And we're the chickens.

190
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:56,538
Yeah, with you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens...

191
00:19:56,573 --> 00:20:00,172
I don't like the look of this one.
His eyes are too close together.

192
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:02,737
- Father, please.
- And he's a Yank!

193
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:05,332
Easy, Pops. Cockfighting's
illegal where I come from.

194
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,255
And where is that exactly?

195
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,210
Just a little place I call the land
of the free and the home of the brave.

196
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:13,210
- Scotland!
- No! America.

197
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,733
Oh! America.

198
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:19,568
Poppycock. Pushy Americans. Always
showing up late for every war.

199
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,727
Overpaid, oversexed and over here!

200
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:27,171
What's eatin' Grandpa?

201
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:29,531
Oh, don't mind him, Mister... Mister?

202
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:33,166
The name's Rocky. Rocky the Rhode
Island Red. Rhodes for short.

203
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:36,805
- Rocky Rhodes?
- Catchy, ain't it?

204
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,684
Um, Mr. Rhodes, is this you?

205
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:43,409
Uh, who wants to know?

206
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:45,488
A group of rather desperate chickens.

207
00:20:45,523 --> 00:20:49,323
You see, if it is you, then you just
might be the answer to our prayers.

208
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:56,360
Well, then, call me a miracle,
doll face, 'cause that's me.

209
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,884
And what brings you
to England, Mr. Rhodes?

210
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:04,280
Why, all the beautiful
English chicks, of course.

211
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:07,243
Give over!

212
00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:09,523
You see, I'm a traveler by nature.

213
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:13,357
I did that whole barnyard thing for a
while, but I couldn't really get into it.

214
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:16,682
Hi. How are you? Nope.

215
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:18,680
The open road. That's more my style.

216
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:22,475
Yep, just give me a pack on my back
and point me where the wind blows.

217
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:26,234
In fact, you know what
they call me back home?

218
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:29,633
You're gonna love this.
The Lone Free Ranger.

219
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:32,398
- Ooh!
- Isn't that great?

220
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:35,032
- I knew it was possible.
- Oh, it's possible, all right.

221
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,877
- I knew the answer would come.
- Amen!

222
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:40,711
We're all going to fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes is going to show us how, right?

223
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,430
That's... What? Did you say "fly"?

224
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,970
- You can teach us.
- No, I can't.

225
00:21:48,004 --> 00:21:51,874
Listen. Shh...
You hear that?

226
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:55,709
That's the open road calling my name,
and I was born to answer that call. Bye.

227
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:59,552
He must have very good hearing.

228
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:03,387
Okay, okay, where's
the exit? Ah, this way.

229
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:07,586
Mr. Rhodes, um, perhaps I didn't
explain our situation properly.

230
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,070
We lay eggs day in and day out,

231
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:12,589
And when we can't lay
any more, they kill us.

232
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:16,424
It's a cruel world, doll face.
You might as well get used to it.

233
00:22:16,742 --> 00:22:20,102
Which part of "they kill
us" do you not understand?

234
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:22,108
I got my own set of
problems to worry about.

235
00:22:22,143 --> 00:22:24,301
Besides, this birdcage can't
be that hard to bust out of.

236
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:26,747
In fact, watch me.

237
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:30,581
It's not so hard to get one
chicken out of here or even two,

238
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,625
But this is about all of us.

239
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,379
- All of you?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.

240
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:39,264
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.

241
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,738
You want to get every chicken in this
place out of here at the same time?

242
00:22:42,773 --> 00:22:46,102
- Of course.
- You're certifiable.

243
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:48,496
You can't pull off a stunt
like that. That's suicide.

244
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:50,022
Where there's a will, there's a way.

245
00:22:50,057 --> 00:22:51,936
Couldn't agree more. I
will be leaving that way.

246
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,816
But...

247
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:55,539
- Mr. Rhodes, please...
- I'm the type of guy

248
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,373
That likes to roam
around I'm never in one...

249
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:20,649
So that's it. You're from the circus.

250
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:22,533
Shh!

251
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,488
You're on the run, aren't you?

252
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:26,453
You wanna keep it down?

253
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,268
I'm trying to lay low here.

254
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:32,012
I should turn you in right now.

255
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:35,766
- You wouldn't. Would you?
- Give me one reason why I shouldn't.

256
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:39,086
Because I'm... cute?

257
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,449
Hey, hey, hey! What kind
of crazy chick are you?

258
00:23:44,484 --> 00:23:47,564
- Do you know what'll happen if he finds me?
- It's a cruel world.

259
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,489
I just decided. I don't like you.

260
00:23:49,524 --> 00:23:52,244
I just decided. I don't
care. Now, show us how to fly.

261
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,922
- With this wing?
- Teach us then.

262
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:56,207
No!

263
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:59,101
He's valuable, you say?

264
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:01,925
- Sure.
- Get the torch.

265
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,161
Now you listen here, sister.
I'm not going back to that life.

266
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:07,880
I'm a Lone Free Ranger.
Emphasis on free!

267
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,679
And that's what we want. Freedom!

268
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,078
Fancy that.
They're coming this way.

269
00:24:16,113 --> 00:24:18,337
Oh, oh, no. No. Oh,
no. They're on to me.

270
00:24:18,372 --> 00:24:20,877
Teach us to fly and we'll hide you.

271
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,742
And if I don't?

272
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:26,116
Was your father by any chance a vulture?

273
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:29,914
Do we have a deal?

274
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,631
Time to make good on that deal, doll...

275
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:51,471
The name is Ginger.

276
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,872
- Comfortable?
- Not really.

277
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:13,706
- Maybe this will help.
- Nice hideout.

278
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,909
Ouch. I had more room in my egg.

279
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:20,465
We've held up our end of the
deal. Tomorrow you hold up yours.

280
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,389
- What deal?
- The flying!

281
00:25:22,424 --> 00:25:24,423
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right,
right, right. Don't worry.

282
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,343
I'll teach you everything I know.

283
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:29,343
Now, which bunk is mine?

284
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:35,425
Absolutely outrageous!

285
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,341
Asking a senior officer
to share his quarters...

286
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:40,897
And with a noncommissioned
Yank, no less.

287
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:43,915
- Why, back in my day, I'd never...
- Hey!

288
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,864
You weren't exactly
my first choice either.

289
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:49,102
And scoot over. Your wing's
on my side of the bunk.

290
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:52,937
Your side of the bunk? The whole
bunk is my side of the bunk!

291
00:25:53,578 --> 00:25:57,376
Just... What's that
smell? Is that your breath?

292
00:25:57,977 --> 00:26:01,775
It's absolutely outrageous.

293
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:09,620
So you wanna fly, huh?

294
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:13,453
Well, it ain't gonna be easy, and it
ain't gonna happen overnight either.

295
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,413
You see, flying takes three things.

296
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:19,212
Hard work, perseverance and...

297
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:22,536
- Hard work.
- You said hard work twice!

298
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:26,330
That's because it takes twice
as much work as perseverance.

299
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,049
Codswallop!

300
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:35,928
Now, the most important thing
is we have to work as a team,

301
00:26:37,168 --> 00:26:40,967
Which means... you do
everything I tell you.

302
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:46,806
Right! Let's rock and roll.

303
00:26:53,564 --> 00:26:56,524
- Oh. Oh, oh.
- Oh. Oh, oh.

304
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:27,197
Mrs. Tweedy! The chickens are...

305
00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:30,721
Pecking?

306
00:27:30,756 --> 00:27:34,556
And left, two, three.
And right, two, three.

307
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:39,275
And... stop right there. Oh, yeah, down.

308
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:43,075
Down. Yeah, yeah, make little
circles. That's it. Faster.

309
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,874
Faster. Oh, yes. Perfect.

310
00:27:47,992 --> 00:27:51,791
Oh, that's the spot.

311
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:03,469
I thought you were going
to teach us how to fly.

312
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:05,994
That's what I'm doing.

313
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:09,027
Isn't there usually
some flapping involved?

314
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,227
Hey, do I tell you how to lay eggs?

315
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:14,672
Relax. We're making progress.

316
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:18,506
Really? I can't help feeling
we're going around in circles.

317
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:23,625
What the... Hey! Cut it
out! You're making me dizzy.

318
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,389
I think they're ready to fly now.

319
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:30,224
Good, because they
certainly can't walk anymore.

320
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:35,102
Up and at 'em, gals. Let's flap.

321
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:42,500
Watch, Fetcher. Let's see if old
Attila the Hen has come to her senses.

322
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,379
It's raining hen!

323
00:28:56,457 --> 00:28:59,057
- What's this caper, love?
- We're flying.

324
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:00,942
Obviously.

325
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:04,777
- Flippin' hell. Look at this, Fetch.
- They're gonna kill themselves.

326
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:09,775
- Wanna watch?
- Yeah, all right.

327
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:16,333
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

328
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:18,657
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

329
00:29:18,692 --> 00:29:22,492
Hey! Careful of those eggs!

330
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:30,610
Sunny-Side up.

331
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:35,371
Now they're over easy!

332
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,169
Definitely scrambled.

333
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:41,053
Go! Go! Go!

334
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:43,808
Go, go, go, go! Go!

335
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:46,527
Poultry in motion!

336
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:02,204
Birds of a feather flop together.

337
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:09,687
Great work, ladies. Great work!

338
00:30:09,722 --> 00:30:12,321
The pain you're feeling
is a good thing. It's good.

339
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:14,886
Pain is your friend, okay?
It's a positive thing.

340
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:18,521
Just keep the faith there, uh... What
was your name? Agnes! You'll get there.

341
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:20,405
Ducky, I think you flew four feet today.

342
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,200
Right, four feet! From
the roof to the ground.

343
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:26,959
It's all part of the process,
ladies. Nothing to worry about.

344
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:29,158
Ya cheese-Eating little...

345
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:32,002
Whoa!

346
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:34,762
That doesn't sound good. Ha, ha, ha.

347
00:30:34,797 --> 00:30:37,477
Okay, the ground's
shaking. Are we worried?

348
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:41,235
Are we worried?

349
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:49,035
The circus. Quick. Hide me.

350
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,039
- Hide me.
- Come on.

351
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:54,833
One isn't awarded a medal like this
for flapping about like a lunatic, what.

352
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:59,116
Now, see here! This is
an officer's quarters.

353
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,591
- Quick. In here.
- Get out of here immediately, sir!

354
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,756
Give it a rest, Pops.

355
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:07,590
Out of here! I shall have you
on a charge within the week.

356
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,181
Cheers, mate.

357
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:54,780
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

358
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:58,899
It's all in your head.

359
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,103
Ooh!

360
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:06,657
What... What... What's all this then?

361
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:08,822
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy.

362
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:12,657
No more wasting time with petty egg
collection and minuscule profits.

363
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:16,736
No more eggs? But we've
always been egg farmers.

364
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:20,094
Me father and his father and all
their fathers. They was always...

365
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:22,871
Poor! Worthless. Nothings.

366
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:25,578
But all that's about to change.

367
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:29,052
This will take Tweedy's
farm out of the dark ages...

368
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:32,809
And into full-Scale
automated production.

369
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:36,532
- Melisha Tweedy will
be poor no longer.

370
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:40,016
Ooh!

371
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:43,850
I'll put it together then, shall I?

372
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:50,774
This isn't good, Mac.

373
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:54,608
Whatever's in those boxes is for us,
and I don't think it's softer hay.

374
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:57,131
Aye, hen. And I hate
to be the voice of doom,

375
00:32:57,166 --> 00:33:00,926
But I've been calculating my figures, and
I just don't think we're built for flyin'.

376
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:05,205
But I saw him. He flew
in over that fence.

377
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,090
Aye, aye, I believe you,

378
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:10,924
But if we could just see it for
ourselves, that may answer some questions.

379
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,489
You're right. I'm sorry.

380
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,927
We've been at this all week,
and we're getting nowhere.

381
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:19,761
If his wing were better, he could...
Oh! I'll have a word with him.

382
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:28,524
Where is he?

383
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,398
They didn't give me this
medal for being a Yank nanny.

384
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:34,639
A simple "I don't know" would suffice.

385
00:33:34,674 --> 00:33:37,795
Beware of that one, young Ginger.

386
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,882
That Yank is not to be trusted.

387
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:44,716
That Yank is our ticket out of here.

388
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:48,835
And the pig says to the horse,
"Hey, fella, why the long face?"

389
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:53,634
Oh, oh, look, look.

390
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:56,611
Oh. Cocktail!

391
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:59,553
Give over!

392
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:06,193
So, um, anyway...

393
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:11,031
Remember those flying tips
tomorrow. They're very important.

394
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:13,950
Keep thinking those flighty thoughts.

395
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,235
Oh, yeah.

396
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,154
They're swell chicks. They really are.

397
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:21,989
Look at what Babs made me. A beak
warmer. Isn't that the cutest?

398
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:26,547
And that Bunty. She
really packs a punch.

399
00:34:26,582 --> 00:34:28,992
Is there a problem here?

400
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,071
- Have we flown over that fence?
- Not quite.

401
00:34:31,106 --> 00:34:32,786
Then there's a problem.

402
00:34:32,787 --> 00:34:34,466
Good things come to
those who wait, doll face.

403
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:38,264
Ginger!

404
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:45,603
Okay, how long did it take you?

405
00:34:45,604 --> 00:34:46,904
To do what?

406
00:34:46,939 --> 00:34:48,789
To learn how to fly.

407
00:34:48,824 --> 00:34:51,703
Apples and oranges, baby
doll. I'm gifted. They're not.

408
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:54,106
You can't compare the two, okay?

409
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,221
The point is, these things take time.

410
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:58,266
Which we are rapidly running out of.

411
00:34:58,301 --> 00:34:59,323
We haven't even lifted
off the ground. Why?

412
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:00,346
Thrust.

413
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:04,180
I went over my calculations, and I figured
the key element we're missing is thrust.

414
00:35:07,979 --> 00:35:09,943
L
- I didn't get a word of that.

415
00:35:09,978 --> 00:35:11,858
Thrust! Other birds
like ducks and geese,

416
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,737
When they take off, what
do they have? Thrust.

417
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:16,981
I swear she ain't usin' real words.

418
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:19,861
- She said we need more thrust.
- Oh, thrust.

419
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:21,795
Well, of course, we need thrust.
Thrust and flying are like this.

420
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,696
That's flying and that's thrust.

421
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:28,155
- Would you excuse us?
- Aye.

422
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,099
Ah, the wing, the wing, the wing.

423
00:35:31,134 --> 00:35:34,373
If we don't see some results by tomorrow,
the deal is off, and you're on your own.

424
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:37,613
No more hiding. The farmers will find
you, and it's back to the circus, flyboy.

425
00:35:38,292 --> 00:35:42,091
You're the first chick I ever
met with the shell still on.

426
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:47,330
Sleep tight, angel face.
The Rock's on the case.

427
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,570
Ginger!

428
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:54,774
Whew!

429
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:58,608
Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!
What, what.

430
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:04,531
- Oh, it was a beaut, guv'nor.
- Hmm?

431
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:07,850
A fine piece of work,
if I do say so meself.

432
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:10,585
- I say so meself too.
- I wish I could have seen it.

433
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,285
We slipped into the farmer's
room, all quiet like.

434
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,701
- Like a fish.
- Yeah, and we...

435
00:36:16,736 --> 00:36:20,083
"Like a fish"? You stupid Norbert.

436
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:22,729
Anyway, guv, here it is.

437
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,567
- El merchandiso.
- That's Spanish.

438
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:29,402
- What are these two crooks doing here?
- So, you know each other.

439
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:31,646
She don't think we're valuable.

440
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:34,286
Guys, you are without
a doubt the sneakiest,

441
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:37,480
Most light-Fingered thieving
parasites I've ever met.

442
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:40,640
- Oh, don't, don't. Stop it.
- I've gone bright red.

443
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:42,962
So, uh, how about them eggs?

444
00:36:42,997 --> 00:36:44,958
- Eggs? Don't tell me you promised them...
- Yep!

445
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:48,334
Promised them every
egg I lay this month.

446
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,841
And when can we expect
the first installment?

447
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:54,675
I'm brewing one up as we speak,
guys. I'll keep you posted.

448
00:36:55,595 --> 00:36:58,196
Pleasure doing business with you, sir.

449
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:01,760
Sucker.

450
00:37:01,795 --> 00:37:03,959
- What?
- You've lied to them.

451
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:07,794
I didn't lie, doll face. I
just... omitted certain truths.

452
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,878
I'll give them exactly what I promised.

453
00:37:09,912 --> 00:37:12,553
- Which is nothing.
- Which is what I'll give them.

454
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:15,592
And what will you give us?

455
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:19,390
Thrust!

456
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:23,310
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good.

457
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,194
Now this is just a little helper.

458
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:29,028
Something to get you going.
It's a thrust exercise.

459
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:31,827
- The tension's killing me.
- It's gonna kill her!

460
00:37:31,862 --> 00:37:35,587
- Release!
- Whoa!

461
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:42,225
Come on! Flap!

462
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:47,345
You can do it. Flap, flap, flap!

463
00:37:50,183 --> 00:37:53,943
Yes, yes, yes!

464
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:57,943
Is that your first offense?

465
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,540
Oops.

466
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:15,898
Roll call! I haven't laid any eggs.

467
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:18,504
- Hide me.
- Three days and not one.

468
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:19,718
Oh, no!

469
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,898
- Why didn't you tell us, Babs?
- Hide me!

470
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:22,938
We've been so busy with the flying...

471
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:24,736
- They're coming!
- Hide me!

472
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:27,216
Hide yourself!

473
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:38,374
Oh!

474
00:39:25,924 --> 00:39:28,803
Double their food rations, Mr. Tweedy.

475
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:31,682
I want them all as fat as this one.

476
00:39:32,043 --> 00:39:35,486
Oh!

477
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:39,321
All of me life flashed before me eyes!

478
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:43,325
It was really borin'.

479
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,159
Chicken feed. My favorite!

480
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:49,239
Wait. Wait.

481
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:55,603
Ooh!

482
00:39:55,638 --> 00:39:59,397
No. Wait!

483
00:40:00,476 --> 00:40:04,276
Babs, please! Bunty! Stop it! Wait!

484
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:08,274
Stop!

485
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:14,718
Stop it!

486
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:18,552
Something is wrong
here. Can't you see that?

487
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,237
Strange boxes arrive in the barn.

488
00:40:21,272 --> 00:40:23,472
Babs stops laying, but they
don't take her to the chop,

489
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,715
And now they're giving us extra food.

490
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,190
Don't you see what's happening?
They're fattening us up.

491
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:32,790
- They're going to kill us all.

492
00:40:32,825 --> 00:40:36,589
Whoa, whoa! Heavy alert.

493
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,189
- She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind?

494
00:40:39,224 --> 00:40:41,273
Keep eating. Save some for me.

495
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:44,591
What are you doing? How
dare you! Let go of me!

496
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:48,387
Listen. I've met some hard-Boiled eggs in
my day, but I'd say you're about 20 minutes.

497
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:52,625
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you got to lighten up.

498
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,550
Over in America, we have this rule.

499
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,884
If you want to motivate
someone, don't mention death.

500
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:00,911
Funny. Over here, the rule
is: Always tell the truth.

501
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:03,869
That's been working like
a real charm, hasn't it?

502
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:07,382
Here's some free advice. You want them to
perform? Tell them what they wanna hear.

503
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:09,826
You mean lie.

504
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:13,461
Here we go again. You
know what your problem is?

505
00:41:13,496 --> 00:41:15,465
You're... difficult.

506
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,260
Why? Because I'm honest? I
care about what happens to them,

507
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,899
Something I wouldn't expect a lone
free ranger to know anything about.

508
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:25,418
If this is the way you show it,
I hope you never care about me.

509
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:29,217
- I can assure you, I
never will. - Good! - Fine!

510
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,292
What's all this?

511
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:21,127
Well, here she is. Ask
and you shall receive.

512
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,086
- That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship is what it is.

513
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:27,902
- Solid as a rock.
- Ooh!

514
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:30,649
- It's supposed to do that.

515
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:34,483
- It's perfect, guys.
- And how's that egg coming?

516
00:42:35,043 --> 00:42:38,243
This is a double yolker.

517
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,401
I don't see what
this has to do with...

518
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:50,645
You will.

519
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,684
We've been workin' too hard.

520
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,319
Time to kick back a bit,
shake those tail feathers.

521
00:42:55,354 --> 00:42:58,958
Look at him. Nellypodging
around like a...

522
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,202
Oh, good heavens. What's happenin'?

523
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:05,037
That's called a beat, sister.
Feel it pulsing through your body?

524
00:43:05,677 --> 00:43:08,856
Oh, yes. Pulsing. Fancy that.

525
00:43:08,891 --> 00:43:12,363
Hey, well, then go with it, baby.

526
00:43:12,398 --> 00:43:15,835
Oh, my. Look! I'm going with it!

527
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:19,278
Bunty, what's got into you?

528
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:21,393
Same thing that's got
into you apparently.

529
00:43:21,428 --> 00:43:23,919
Flip, flop, fly

530
00:43:23,954 --> 00:43:26,152
- I don't care if I die
- Just go with the flow, gal!

531
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,433
- Flip, flop, fly
- Let it go!

532
00:43:28,468 --> 00:43:30,956
I don't care if I die

533
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:34,036
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-Bye

534
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:37,309
Now, see here. I don't
recall authorizing a hop.

535
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:39,311
Oh, shut up and dance.

536
00:43:39,346 --> 00:43:43,069
Oh! Oh!

537
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:48,507
What are you sobbing about,
you nancy?

538
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:53,306
Little moments like this, mate. It's
what makes the job all worthwhile.

539
00:43:58,145 --> 00:44:01,905
Wanna dance?

540
00:44:02,026 --> 00:44:03,910
Yeah, all right.

541
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:07,344
Now, give me one more kiss
Hold it a long, long time

542
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:08,988
Huh?

543
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:12,782
Give me one more kiss
Hold it a long, long time

544
00:44:14,103 --> 00:44:16,462
Love me, baby, till the
feelin' hits my head like wine

545
00:44:16,497 --> 00:44:18,502
So fine So glad you're mine

546
00:44:18,537 --> 00:44:20,666
Flip, flop, fly

547
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:23,385
I don't care if I die

548
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,219
Flip, flop, fly I don't care if I die

549
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:31,298
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-Bye

550
00:44:32,138 --> 00:44:35,743
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-Bye

551
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:39,577
Yeah, don't ever leave
me Don't ever say good-Bye

552
00:44:39,856 --> 00:44:42,657
- Yeah
- Ooh!

553
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:49,215
Did ya see that? I flew!

554
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:52,379
Attagirl, Babsy. Attagirl.

555
00:44:52,414 --> 00:44:55,933
- Oh! Your wing. It's better.
- Well...

556
00:44:55,968 --> 00:44:58,430
- How about that?
- Fantastic.

557
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:01,439
You can fly for us tomorrow.

558
00:45:01,474 --> 00:45:04,412
Uh, uh, yeah, so it seems.

559
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:05,976
I flew! I flew!

560
00:45:06,011 --> 00:45:09,695
Looks like I owe you an apology.

561
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,170
I didn't think you cared
about us, but after all this...

562
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:15,846
Well, it seems I was wrong.

563
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:18,453
Hey, easy, Miss Hard-Boiled.

564
00:45:18,488 --> 00:45:20,848
I might think you're turning soft.

565
00:45:25,128 --> 00:45:28,927
Uh, listen, there's
something I got to tell ya.

566
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,646
I...

567
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,364
No. You'd better wait here.

568
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,479
Ooh, that's champion,
that is. What is it?

569
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,558
It's a pie machine, you idiot.

570
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:11,277
Chickens go in, pies come out.

571
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:13,633
Ooh! What kind of pies?

572
00:46:13,668 --> 00:46:15,921
- Apple.
- My favorite!

573
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:19,756
Chicken pies, you great
lummox! Imagine it.

574
00:46:21,035 --> 00:46:23,995
In less than a fortnight,
every grocers' in the county...

575
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,951
Will be stocked with box upon box...

576
00:46:26,986 --> 00:46:29,873
Of Mrs. Tweedy's Homemade Chicken Pies.

577
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:31,479
Just Missus?

578
00:46:31,514 --> 00:46:34,512
Woman's touch. Makes the
public feel more comfortable.

579
00:46:34,547 --> 00:46:37,797
Oh, right. How does it work?

580
00:46:37,832 --> 00:46:41,590
Get me a chicken and I'll show you.

581
00:46:41,871 --> 00:46:44,390
I know just the one.

582
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:51,149
I've got a score to settle with you.

583
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:55,069
Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!

584
00:46:58,187 --> 00:47:01,987
We mustn't panic.
We mustn't panic!

585
00:47:02,426 --> 00:47:04,310
Quiet there!

586
00:47:04,345 --> 00:47:08,145
Quiet, I say! Let's have
some discipline, what, what.

587
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:11,984
The enemy has taken a prisoner.
This calls for retaliation!

588
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:15,228
- Retaliation!
- What's going on? What's happening?

589
00:47:15,263 --> 00:47:19,062
They got Ginger, Mr. Rhodes.
They're taking her to the chop!

590
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:23,102
Well, what are you waiting for,
laddie? Fly over there. Save her!

591
00:47:23,461 --> 00:47:27,260
Of course... No, no! No,
that's just what they'd expect.

592
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:29,941
But I say we give them the
old element of surprise.

593
00:47:29,976 --> 00:47:32,597
And catch Jerry with his trousers down.

594
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:35,219
I like the sound of
that. What's the plan?

595
00:47:35,254 --> 00:47:37,416
The plan... The plan.

596
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:39,542
The plan... Uh, Babs!

597
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:43,377
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.

598
00:47:53,856 --> 00:47:55,740
Whoa.

599
00:47:55,775 --> 00:47:58,215
Look at the size of that thing.

600
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:04,658
Oh, no!

601
00:48:04,693 --> 00:48:07,752
Chickens go in,

602
00:48:07,787 --> 00:48:10,812
Pies come out.

603
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:14,056
Chicken pies.

604
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,971
Not... Not apple pies.

605
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:19,769
Chicken!

606
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,788
Oh, great. Brilliant!

607
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:29,294
- Yo, baby doll!
- Rocky!

608
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:31,732
- I'm coming!
- Hurry!

609
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:34,332
- I'm still coming!
- Come on!

610
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:38,166
- Stop this thing!
- I'm gettin' there!

611
00:48:40,046 --> 00:48:42,125
Oh, shoot!

612
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,170
Rocky!

613
00:48:44,205 --> 00:48:47,044
I'll be down before you can say...

614
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:48,683
Mixed vegetables!

615
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,162
Aaaah!

616
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:55,562
Aaah! Ohh!

617
00:48:57,882 --> 00:49:01,640
Whoa-Ohh-Ohh-Ohh!

618
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,179
Whoa-Ohh-Ohh!

619
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:11,004
D
- Oh! Get it?

620
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:13,618
- Dough!
- I'm stuck!

621
00:49:13,653 --> 00:49:16,197
Nothing to it. Oops.

622
00:49:24,355 --> 00:49:28,155
Ohh! Oh!

623
00:49:30,954 --> 00:49:34,754
Hang on!

624
00:49:36,914 --> 00:49:40,753
Look out!

625
00:49:42,872 --> 00:49:46,672
Whoa!

626
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,909
Hey! Aha!

627
00:50:00,908 --> 00:50:04,667
Yes!

628
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:11,786
Oh, it's like an oven in here.

629
00:50:20,504 --> 00:50:22,230
Come on!

630
00:50:22,265 --> 00:50:25,624
Wait up! I'm com...

631
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,280
Don't leave...

632
00:50:28,315 --> 00:50:30,902
Get over to the...

633
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,379
The door! Come on!

634
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:07,494
She's gonna blow! Run!

635
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,858
Huh?

636
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:14,252
What did you do, you great pudding?

637
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:18,051
I didn't do 'owt!

638
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:28,130
- Turn it off!
- It won't turn off!

639
00:51:50,285 --> 00:51:53,444
- Ouch!
- We've got to show the others. Come on.

640
00:52:01,762 --> 00:52:04,001
Look! I fixed it!

641
00:52:04,036 --> 00:52:05,761
Huh?

642
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,327
- Chicken pies?
- Ohh! - Oh, no!

643
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:14,241
- Yes, but...
- I don't want to be a pie.

644
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:17,324
I don't like gravy.

645
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,638
Ladies, please. Let's
not lose our heads.

646
00:52:20,673 --> 00:52:24,437
Lose our heads?

647
00:52:30,157 --> 00:52:33,996
What I meant to say was, Rocky sabotaged
the machine and bought us more time.

648
00:52:34,031 --> 00:52:35,880
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

649
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:38,994
And better still, he's
going to fly for us tomorrow.

650
00:52:39,029 --> 00:52:42,074
And once we've seen
how's it done, we'll get it.

651
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:43,958
So don't worry,

652
00:52:43,993 --> 00:52:47,752
Because tomorrow everything's
going to go much, much smoother.

653
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:59,790
All right, Pops, what did I do now?

654
00:52:59,825 --> 00:53:02,989
A very brave and honorable deed, sir.

655
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:06,994
In the light of your
action this evening, I...

656
00:53:07,029 --> 00:53:10,827
I dutifully admit that I
have misjudged your character.

657
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:15,986
So I present you with
this medal for bravery.

658
00:53:16,386 --> 00:53:18,271
And...

659
00:53:18,306 --> 00:53:22,065
I salute you.

660
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:24,390
In honor of the occasion,

661
00:53:24,425 --> 00:53:27,864
I surrender the bunk entirely.

662
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:31,303
I shall sleep under the stars.

663
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:36,303
Oh, uh, I await tomorrow's
flying demonstration...

664
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:40,261
With great anticipation.

665
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:45,221
You and me both, Pops.

666
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:54,223
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Were you...

667
00:53:54,258 --> 00:53:56,703
- Is this your... I'll get down.
- No, no, it's just...

668
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:58,817
- Since you're here...
- No, I'm glad you're here, because...

669
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:00,737
- I'm sorry. You go first.
- You go ahead. I'll...

670
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:05,101
Um, I just wanted to say...

671
00:54:05,136 --> 00:54:07,976
I may have been a bit harsh at first.

672
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:11,215
Well, what I really mean is,

673
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,100
Thank you...

674
00:54:13,135 --> 00:54:15,694
For saving my life.

675
00:54:15,729 --> 00:54:18,253
For saving our lives.

676
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,417
You know,

677
00:54:20,452 --> 00:54:22,337
I come up here every night...

678
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:26,172
And look out to that hill and just imagine
what it must be like on the other side.

679
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:28,696
It's funny, I've...

680
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:32,210
I've never actually felt
grass beneath my feet.

681
00:54:32,245 --> 00:54:34,095
I'm sorry.

682
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:37,329
Here I am rambling on about hills and
grass, and you had something to say.

683
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:39,174
Uh,
y-Y-Yeah.

684
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:43,009
Um, it's just that, y
- You know,

685
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:46,968
Life as I've experienced
it, you know, out there,

686
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:50,066
Lone free rangin' and stuff, it's, uh,

687
00:54:50,101 --> 00:54:52,651
It's full of disappointments and, uh...

688
00:54:52,686 --> 00:54:55,486
What, you mean grass isn't
all it's cracked up to be?

689
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:57,370
Grass! Exactly. Grass.

690
00:54:57,405 --> 00:55:00,249
It's always greener on the other side.

691
00:55:00,284 --> 00:55:04,083
And then you get there
and it's brown and prickly.

692
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:08,603
You see what I'm tryin' to say?

693
00:55:09,763 --> 00:55:13,562
What I'm trying to say is,

694
00:55:14,842 --> 00:55:18,281
You're welcome.

695
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,205
You know,

696
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,999
That hill is looking closer
tonight than it ever has before.

697
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,563
Oh!

698
00:55:28,598 --> 00:55:32,398
Well, good night... Rocky.

699
00:55:34,038 --> 00:55:37,837
Good night... Ginger.

700
00:55:59,472 --> 00:56:03,111
Company, attention!

701
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:10,589
Well, today's the day,
girls. We're going to fly!

702
00:56:10,624 --> 00:56:13,114
I can feel it!

703
00:56:13,149 --> 00:56:16,469
Finally, we get to see a
real professional in action.

704
00:56:16,504 --> 00:56:19,348
Better start warming
up. I'll go and get him.

705
00:56:19,383 --> 00:56:21,632
- Rocky. Knock
-Knock.

706
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:25,467
Everyone's waiting, so I told them to...

707
00:56:29,106 --> 00:56:32,904
R
- Rocky?

708
00:58:10,004 --> 00:58:12,529
Oh, a cannon.

709
00:58:12,564 --> 00:58:14,583
Aye, that would give you thrust.

710
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:16,567
I knew he was fake all along.

711
00:58:16,602 --> 00:58:20,401
In fact, I'm not even
certain he was American.

712
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:23,280
So, what's the next plan, hen?

713
00:58:23,315 --> 00:58:25,165
Let's face it.

714
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,079
The only way out of here
is wrapped in pastry.

715
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,924
Perhaps he just went on holiday.

716
00:58:31,959 --> 00:58:35,118
Perhaps he just went to get
away from your infernal knitting!

717
00:58:35,153 --> 00:58:37,963
Ohh! Ohh!

718
00:58:37,998 --> 00:58:41,358
You were the one that was always
hitting him. See how you like it.

719
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:44,156
Don't push me, four-Eyes!

720
00:58:45,991 --> 00:58:47,133
Quiet there!

721
00:58:47,368 --> 00:58:49,041
Quiet, I say!

722
00:58:49,076 --> 00:58:52,715
Dissension in the ranks. Precisely
what Jerry would have wanted.

723
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,238
The old divide and conquer.

724
00:58:54,273 --> 00:58:58,074
A proper squadron work together,
like we did in my R.A.F. Days.

725
00:58:58,473 --> 00:59:01,093
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map...

726
00:59:01,128 --> 00:59:03,677
And old Whizzbang at
the tail-End Charlie.

727
00:59:03,712 --> 00:59:06,832
WingCo would give the call, hop
in the old crate, chocks away!

728
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:10,116
Wizard show it was.
That's how you get medals.

729
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:13,950
Will you shut up about
your stupid blooming medals!

730
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,949
Ooh!

731
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:20,835
Ohh!

732
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:22,874
How dare you!

733
00:59:22,909 --> 00:59:25,272
Madam, forgive me.

734
00:59:25,307 --> 00:59:27,308
A-As an officer, I offer my most...

735
00:59:43,024 --> 00:59:45,983
Fowler?

736
00:59:47,903 --> 00:59:50,343
Everyone, shut up!

737
00:59:51,663 --> 00:59:55,462
Eh?

738
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,106
Fowler.

739
01:00:01,141 --> 01:00:03,480
What exactly is the R.A.F.?

740
01:00:03,515 --> 01:00:05,887
What do you mean, what is it?

741
01:00:05,922 --> 01:00:08,990
The Royal Air Force is what.

742
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:12,058
Then what's the "old crate"?

743
01:00:13,337 --> 01:00:17,136
Ahh! There she is.

744
01:00:17,778 --> 01:00:19,581
Gorgeous, isn't she?

745
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,461
You mean, you flew in one of these?

746
01:00:22,496 --> 01:00:25,975
Beautifully built. In fact, there's
a bit of a story to that as well.

747
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,859
We were out on a "recce," you see.

748
01:00:27,894 --> 01:00:30,734
Ops had given the go-Ahead,
but the weather duffed up.

749
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:33,499
Yes. Of course.

750
01:00:33,534 --> 01:00:36,417
We might actually be
able to pull this off.

751
01:00:36,452 --> 01:00:39,692
- We're still going to fly out of here.
- What, what?

752
01:00:39,727 --> 01:00:41,572
Fowler's provided the answer.

753
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:43,456
I have?

754
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:46,331
Uh, yes, yes, yes. Of course I have.

755
01:00:46,366 --> 01:00:48,267
Uh, how have I?

756
01:00:48,302 --> 01:00:50,170
We'll make...

757
01:00:50,205 --> 01:00:52,054
A crate.

758
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:55,808
Mac, you'll handle the engineering.

759
01:00:55,843 --> 01:00:57,574
Babs, manufacturing.

760
01:00:57,609 --> 01:00:59,728
Fowler will be chief aviation advisor.

761
01:00:59,763 --> 01:01:01,345
Bunty, eggs.

762
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,891
- Eggs?
- Eggs.

763
01:01:02,926 --> 01:01:06,127
Right, just like the ones
that rooster was gonna lay.

764
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,971
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they?

765
01:01:09,006 --> 01:01:11,885
- Don't they?
- No, it's a lady thing, apparently.

766
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,770
Ask your mum.

767
01:01:13,805 --> 01:01:17,044
One egg for every item on the
list. First payment in advance.

768
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:19,123
Right! When do we start?

769
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:21,540
Come on!

770
01:01:21,575 --> 01:01:24,648
Hey.

771
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:27,721
Oh!

772
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:32,046
Huh?

773
01:01:32,081 --> 01:01:35,580
What the dickens?

774
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:39,079
Oh, gnomes now.

775
01:01:42,478 --> 01:01:45,537
Voila!

776
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:48,597
Give me.

777
01:01:57,955 --> 01:02:01,074
Hmm?

778
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:04,195
Aah!

779
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,991
- Ohh!
- All right, here.

780
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:30,548
Eggs from heaven!

781
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:33,508
No! From her bum!

782
01:02:58,903 --> 01:03:02,547
Mmm?

783
01:03:02,582 --> 01:03:06,021
- Idiot!
- That was close.

784
01:03:06,056 --> 01:03:07,985
Too close.

785
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,821
We can't stop now. Come
on, everyone! Go for it!

786
01:03:10,856 --> 01:03:14,620
Really go for it! Go, go, go, go!

787
01:03:15,938 --> 01:03:18,419
- Mac, we need those
calculations quickly. - Uh-Huh.

788
01:03:18,454 --> 01:03:21,435
Agnes, that has to be really secure.

789
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,417
- Careful up there, Fowler!
- Roger!

790
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:26,302
Bunty, give him a hand.

791
01:03:26,337 --> 01:03:28,176
Well done, Babs. Keep it up.

792
01:03:28,211 --> 01:03:31,974
No problem, doll face.

793
01:03:44,693 --> 01:03:47,131
Oh, I'm the type of guy

794
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:49,349
That likes to roam around

795
01:03:49,384 --> 01:03:51,817
I'm never in one place

796
01:03:51,852 --> 01:03:54,215
I roam from town to town

797
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:57,770
And when I found myself
fallin' for some girl

798
01:03:57,805 --> 01:03:59,706
I'd hop right in that car...

799
01:03:59,741 --> 01:04:01,609
And travel 'round the world

800
01:04:01,644 --> 01:04:03,848
'Cause I'm a wanderer

801
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:05,693
Yeah A wanderer

802
01:04:05,728 --> 01:04:08,208
I roam around and
'round Around and 'round

803
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:11,487
'Cause I'm a wanderer

804
01:04:11,522 --> 01:04:13,087
Yeah, a wanderer

805
01:04:13,122 --> 01:04:14,411
Oh, boy.

806
01:04:14,446 --> 01:04:20,325
I roam around and 'round
Around and 'round, around

807
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,124
Come on.

808
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:26,404
Please.

809
01:04:29,523 --> 01:04:33,282
Oh, no. He's fixed it.

810
01:04:37,201 --> 01:04:40,801
Get the chickens.

811
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:43,938
Which ones?

812
01:04:43,973 --> 01:04:47,040
All of them.

813
01:04:51,598 --> 01:04:54,283
Me tools!

814
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:57,117
Why, you thieving little buggers!

815
01:04:57,152 --> 01:05:00,876
What's the plan?

816
01:05:02,676 --> 01:05:04,475
- Attack!
- Huh?

817
01:05:06,275 --> 01:05:09,574
Nice plan.

818
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:12,874
Mrs. Tweedy!

819
01:05:13,634 --> 01:05:16,637
Aaaah! Mrs. Tweedy!

820
01:05:16,672 --> 01:05:19,472
The chickens are revolting!

821
01:05:19,507 --> 01:05:22,272
Finally, something we agree on.

822
01:05:22,307 --> 01:05:24,071
Help! Mrs...

823
01:05:26,911 --> 01:05:28,650
Mmm... Mmm?

824
01:05:28,685 --> 01:05:31,418
Under the hut.

825
01:05:31,453 --> 01:05:34,150
Come on!

826
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:40,668
- What have we done?
- This is it, everyone.

827
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,553
We're escaping.

828
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:44,832
- What, now?
- Now!

829
01:05:44,867 --> 01:05:47,946
- But, Ginger, she's not ready.
- Listen.

830
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:51,026
We'll either die free
chickens or die trying.

831
01:05:53,105 --> 01:05:56,104
Are those the only choices?

832
01:05:56,139 --> 01:05:59,105
- Let's do it.
- Scramble!

833
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:14,341
This way!

834
01:06:44,454 --> 01:06:48,253
Mrs. Tweedy!

835
01:06:48,414 --> 01:06:51,258
The exits are located here and here.

836
01:06:51,293 --> 01:06:53,673
In the quite likely
event of an emergency,

837
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:56,052
Put your head between your knees and...

838
01:06:56,087 --> 01:06:58,055
Kiss your bum good-Bye.

839
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,211
All right, Fowler, ready for takeoff.

840
01:07:00,246 --> 01:07:04,009
Behind you all the way.

841
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:06,769
But you're supposed to be up there.

842
01:07:06,804 --> 01:07:08,415
You're the pilot.

843
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:12,248
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I can't fly this contraption.

844
01:07:12,609 --> 01:07:15,608
Back in your day...
the Royal Air Force...

845
01:07:15,643 --> 01:07:18,407
6-4-4 Squadron,
poultry division.

846
01:07:18,442 --> 01:07:20,292
We were the mascots.

847
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,965
You mean you never
actually flew the plane?

848
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,102
Good heavens, no.

849
01:07:24,937 --> 01:07:27,170
I'm a chicken.

850
01:07:27,205 --> 01:07:31,003
The Royal Air Force doesn't let chickens
behind the controls of a complex aircraft.

851
01:07:32,524 --> 01:07:34,608
We're all gonna die!

852
01:07:34,243 --> 01:07:36,529
Fowler, you have to fly it.

853
01:07:36,564 --> 01:07:40,322
You're always talking about back in
your day. Well, today is your day.

854
01:07:42,122 --> 01:07:45,881
You can do it, you old sausage.

855
01:07:46,881 --> 01:07:49,040
Wing Commander T.I. Fowler...

856
01:07:49,075 --> 01:07:50,961
Reporting for duty.

857
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:56,084
Well, come on. What are you waiting for?

858
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:59,878
We haven't got all day. Let's
get this crate off the ground.

859
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:01,794
Fowler! Now!

860
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:03,677
Roger! Contact!

861
01:08:15,155 --> 01:08:18,955
Cleared for takeoff!

862
01:08:23,552 --> 01:08:27,512
Chocks away!

863
01:08:27,547 --> 01:08:31,313
Whoa!

864
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:38,310
- Full throttle!
- Full throttle!

865
01:08:58,346 --> 01:09:00,710
We need more power!

866
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:04,544
I cannot work miracles, Cap'n!
We're givin' her all she's got!

867
01:09:13,543 --> 01:09:17,342
- Gotcha!
- Hard right!

868
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,062
Oh, mother!

869
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,780
Turn her around. I'll get the ramp.

870
01:09:36,218 --> 01:09:40,018
Aaah!

871
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:44,456
Put the ramp down.

872
01:09:46,295 --> 01:09:48,575
You are going to be a pie!

873
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:55,853
Ginger!

874
01:09:56,254 --> 01:10:00,052
Rocky!

875
01:10:05,851 --> 01:10:09,650
Heads up!

876
01:10:20,468 --> 01:10:22,213
Look out!

877
01:10:22,248 --> 01:10:26,007
- Aah!
- Clear the runway!

878
01:10:43,924 --> 01:10:47,722
Ginger! Let's go!

879
01:10:50,401 --> 01:10:54,161
We're flying!

880
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:06,959
- Aah!
- That's for leaving.

881
01:11:06,994 --> 01:11:08,403
Eew.

882
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:12,237
And this is for coming back.

883
01:11:13,037 --> 01:11:14,922
- Whoa!
- Uhh!

884
01:11:14,957 --> 01:11:17,961
Great Scot! What was that?

885
01:11:17,996 --> 01:11:21,795
A cling-On, Cap'n! And
the engines can't take it!

886
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:28,593
Oh, goodness.

887
01:11:28,628 --> 01:11:31,272
Babs! Scissors!

888
01:11:31,307 --> 01:11:32,597
Bingo.

889
01:11:32,632 --> 01:11:34,278
Lower me down.

890
01:11:34,313 --> 01:11:35,992
- But, Ginger, I...
- Just do it.

891
01:11:36,027 --> 01:11:38,277
Increase velocity!

892
01:11:38,312 --> 01:11:42,071
- What does that mean?
- It means pedal your flippin' giblets out!

893
01:11:54,308 --> 01:11:58,108
- Lower!
- I'm trying!

894
01:12:00,547 --> 01:12:03,626
- Aah!
- Aaah!

895
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:06,705
- Fowler, look out!

896
01:12:12,705 --> 01:12:16,464
- Whoa!
- Oh! Ginger!

897
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:28,180
Fire! Fire!

898
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:32,340
Me eggs.

899
01:12:32,661 --> 01:12:35,065
No!

900
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,858
Blea-Aah!

901
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:41,263
More ammo! Hurry!

902
01:12:41,298 --> 01:12:43,457
- We got no more eggs!
- Ginger!

903
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,097
Look out!

904
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:56,776
No!

905
01:13:07,373 --> 01:13:10,192
- Huh? -
Bye-Bye.

906
01:13:10,227 --> 01:13:13,011
- Aaah!
- Bombs away!

907
01:13:13,046 --> 01:13:15,776
Mr. Tweedy!

908
01:13:15,811 --> 01:13:19,571
Oh, that was good. That was good!

909
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:23,469
The old bird bought it!

910
01:13:23,504 --> 01:13:26,448
Mrs. Tweedy! Mrs. Twee...

911
01:13:43,724 --> 01:13:47,525
Whoa!

912
01:13:57,282 --> 01:14:01,081
I told you they was organized.

913
01:14:10,919 --> 01:14:12,838
We did it, everyone!

914
01:14:24,957 --> 01:14:28,756
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

915
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:33,454
Aww!

916
01:14:33,489 --> 01:14:35,318
Whoa!

917
01:14:35,353 --> 01:14:39,113
Keep peddling! We're not there yet!

918
01:14:41,673 --> 01:14:45,472
You can't see paradise
if you don't pedal!

919
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:53,635
Put your drumsticks into it!

920
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:55,994
That's what I told him, what, what.

921
01:14:56,029 --> 01:14:59,708
We were losing altitude, you see,
and heading for a fearful prang.

922
01:14:59,743 --> 01:15:01,944
This is a lovely holiday.

923
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:04,112
I'll be sad to go back.

924
01:15:04,147 --> 01:15:06,986
Safety at all times is imperative.

925
01:15:07,021 --> 01:15:08,923
Now, wind 'er up and...

926
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:10,825
- Whee!
- Let 'er go!

927
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:12,792
So...

928
01:15:12,827 --> 01:15:14,746
Is it as good as you imagined?

929
01:15:14,781 --> 01:15:16,791
No.

930
01:15:17,126 --> 01:15:19,869
It's better.

931
01:15:20,604 --> 01:15:23,703
Come on. I'll show
you how to play cricket.

932
01:15:26,823 --> 01:15:28,948
'Ey, 'ey, here's a thought.

933
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:32,142
Why don't we get an egg and
start our own chicken farm?

934
01:15:32,177 --> 01:15:35,021
That way we'll have all
the eggs we could eat.

935
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:37,540
Right. We'll need a chicken then.

936
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,346
No. No, we'll need an egg.

937
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:42,624
You have the egg first. That's
where you get the chicken from.

938
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:45,579
No, that's cobblers. If you don't have
a chicken, where you gonna get an egg?

939
01:15:45,614 --> 01:15:48,424
From the chicken that
comes from the egg.

940
01:15:48,459 --> 01:15:51,303
Yeah, but you have to have
an egg to have a chicken.

941
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,217
Yeah, but you gotta get the
chicken first to get the egg,

942
01:15:53,252 --> 01:15:57,056
And then the egg...
you get the chicken out.

943
01:15:57,091 --> 01:16:00,855
Hang on. Let's go over this again.

944
01:16:08,173 --> 01:16:10,974
<i># All right. #</i>

945
01:16:11,009 --> 01:16:13,019
<i># Yeah. #</i>

946
01:16:12,752 --> 01:16:17,791
<i># When I get the blues,
gonna get me a rockin' chair #</i>

947
01:16:17,831 --> 01:16:22,071
<i># When I get the blues,
gonna get me a rockin' chair #</i>

948
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:26,790
<i># When the blues overtake me,

951

<i># She's so small, she can rumba

952

967
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:20,978
The egg, obviously.

968
01:19:21,013 --> 01:19:22,898
Rollin' along, happy as Larry.

969
01:19:22,933 --> 01:19:25,832
Then, crack! Hatches
into the first chicken.

970
01:19:25,867 --> 01:19:28,418
Yeah, but where'd the
egg come from, then?

971
01:19:28,453 --> 01:19:29,972
What do you mean, where'd it come from?

972
01:19:30,007 --> 01:19:32,358
Egg comes rollin' along, happy as Larry.

973
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:35,574
It's wonderin'
where'd it come from?

974
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:38,669
Without a chicken, you get
no egg to come rollin' along.

975
01:19:39,104 --> 01:19:41,493
Well, conversely, without an
egg to hatch into the chicken,

976
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:44,407
Then there will be no chicken to lay the
other egg that hatches into the chicken...

977
01:19:44,442 --> 01:19:46,153
That lays the egg I
mentioned in the first place.

978
01:19:46,187 --> 01:19:47,427
So we got two eggs now?

979
01:19:47,428 --> 01:19:50,067
No, we're still talking
about the very first egg.

980
01:19:50,102 --> 01:19:51,923
What happened about
the very first chicken?

981
01:19:51,724 --> 01:19:53,646
It's in the very first egg!

982
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:56,525
- Don't you listenin'?
- Uh, guys, guys?

983
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,721
Tryin' to enjoy paradise over here.

984
01:19:59,156 --> 01:20:00,884
- Oh, sorry, guv.
- Beg your pardon.

985
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:03,924
- Won't happen again.
- Thanks.

986
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:06,247
- Gitface.
- Pillock.

987
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:09,562
Thinks he's such a big shot 'cause
he's got his name on a poster.

988
01:20:09,797 --> 01:20:11,967
These show biz folk are all the same.

989
01:20:11,502 --> 01:20:14,846
- Yeah, the rats are the stars, actually.
- Yeah, of course they are.

990
01:20:15,081 --> 01:20:16,521
- We do all the work,
- But he does get all the birds.

991
01:20:16,522 --> 01:20:17,322
He gets all the credit.

992
01:20:17,796 --> 01:20:19,800
- He gets everything.
- Yes, he does. Everything.

993
01:20:19,835 --> 01:20:23,599
- You said it, mate.
- I know.
