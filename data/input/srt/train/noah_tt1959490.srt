I want my daddy to sing to me.

You know, I, too, lost my father

when I was very young.

189
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,410
There's a song he used
to sing me sometimes

YOUNG HAM: Then why
are you helping us?

211

The Creator formed us

The day He made the heavens.

We watched over Adam and Eve.

Saw their frailty and their love.

215

And then we saw their fall.
And we pitied them.

<i>We were not stone then,

Ah, berries, yes.

Yes.

Before he walked on,

287
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,286
my father Enoch told me
that one day,

if man continued in his ways,

289

The Creator would
annihilate this world.

So what I saw is true?

291
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,326
All life blotted out
because of what man has done?

292
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,329
Can it not be averted?

293
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,801
Noah, you must trust
that He speaks in a way

that you can understand.

295
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,886
So you tell me.

296
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,163
Can this destruction be averted?

297
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,727
No.

298
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,166
Oh.

299
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,640
He sent me here.

300
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,681
Why send me if there's
nothing I can do to stop it?

301
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,566
Well, perhaps He simply sends
you here to share a cup of tea

302
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,205
with an old man.

303
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,375
So, is that all you saw?

304
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,085
The fires of destruction
on this place?

305
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,207
No, not fire.

306
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,406
Water.

307
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,055
Water? Huh.

308
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,175
My father said it would be fire.

309
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,885
I saw water.
Death by water.

310
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,525
I saw death.

311
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,843
And I saw new life.

312
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,563
There's something more, Grandfather.

313
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,409
Something I'm to do.

314
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,080

315
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,129
I just didn't see what it was.

316
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,245
New life.

317
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,206
Well, perhaps there is
more for you to see.

318
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,921
Did He not send you here

319
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,202
to drink a cup of tea
with an old man?

320
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,082
The medicine always tastes bad.

the only one moving.

METHUSELAH: Was she hurt badly?

323
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,615
YOUNG SHEM: She had
a big cut on her belly.

324
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,007
Mother helped
and I held her hand.

325
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,847
That must have
made her feel safe.

326
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,527
Well?

327
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,325
Fire consumes all.

328
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,844
Water cleanses.

329
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,282
It separates the foul
from the pure.

330
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,369
The wicked from the innocent.

331
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,282
And that which sinks
from that which rises.

332
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,371
He destroys all,

333
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,003
but only to start again.

334
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,847

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,161
Yes.
