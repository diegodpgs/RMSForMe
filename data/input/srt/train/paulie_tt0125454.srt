1
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:50,582
The agency told you you had to pay
for your own uniforms, right?

2
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,311
(Heavy accent)
Yes, I to buy with money from job.

3
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,187
No, no, no. You can't start
a job without a uniform.

4
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,920
But how to buy when not been paid?

5
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,326
- You don't have any money?
- No.

6
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,197
This is why I take job.
To make money.

7
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,667
This is why I come to America.

8
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,001
- To be big shoot.
- Shot. Big shot.

9
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:19,977
I try not to live in past.
Only present tense since I come.

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,813
(Chuckling)
Yeah, but big shoot makes no sense.

11
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,886
This is the main building.

12
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:31,923
Administration, lecture rooms
and the laboratories.

13
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,427
It's just the floors in here.

14
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,589
Don't worry about the cages
or what's in 'em.

15
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,224
The research assistants feed them.

16
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,633
You know, they study animal behavior.

17
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:48,468
In cage,
only can behave like prisoner.

18
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:52,636
Word of advice, my man.
Try not to think so much,

19
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,647
and whatever you do,
don't bother the professors.

20
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,546
They're the real big shoots
around here.

21
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,055
Watch your step.

22
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,923
(Sighing)

23
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,331
This is purgatory.

24
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,204
I'll get the trash.

25
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,905
(Snoring)

26
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,459
What bird kind is this?

27
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,222
(Snorts) Huh?

28
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,923
The biting kind. Be careful.

29
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,365
(Growls)

30
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,270
Are you bird or dog?

31
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,068
What... What he's doing down here?

32
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,169
Paulie's an old project
for Dr. Reingold.

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,807
Didn't work out. Loss of funding
or something. I can't remember.

34
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:08,752
But he's not eat, I think,
and he lose his feather.

35
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,289
Don't worry about him.

36
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,985
Come on. I'll show you
where the incinerator is.

37
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,643
(Singing)

38
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,955
(Singing continues)

39
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,834
(Buffer starts)

40
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,721
(Singing)

41
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,928
# I loved you
the first time I saw you

42
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:39,042
# I always will love you

43
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,045
# Marie #

44
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,816
You made me your fairy godmother.

45
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:57,419
So if I'm your fairy godmother,
I command you to go to sleep.

46
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,760
You gotta go to sleep, Marie.

47
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:04,326
Look, I'll be right here.

48
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,338
Good night, Marie. I love you, too.

49
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,439
OK, I'll see you in the morning.

50
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,977
- (Yelling)
- Hey, who are you?

51
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,077
What are you doing down here?
Get outta here!

52
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:26,488
Come on! Leave me alone!
And don't come back!

53
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:30,926
Virgil. First, he's singing.
Now he's talking.

54
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,998
Quit messing with that parrot

55
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,432
and get back to work
before you get us both fired.

56
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,193
M.A.

57
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,360
Hello.

58
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,204
"Food consists of seeds,

59
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,710
"nuts, bugs.

60
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,612
"Flocks are seen feeding
in mango trees,

61
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,378
"bearing ripe fruit."

62
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,080
(Door opens)

63
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,862
Mango.

64
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,675
Muchas gracias.

65
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,033
(Sighing) Let's see.

66
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,472
What shall I have for lunch tonight?

67
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,907
Now, here is some big banana,

68
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,883
very plump papaya...

69
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:37,786
and... some nice mango.

70
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,826
Oh, yes, this is a good one.

71
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:46,991
Nice and yellow on the inside.

72
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:55,672
Oh, yes,
this going to taste delirious.

73
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,009
You like mango, bird?

74
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,087
Hmm? It's very juicy...

75
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,487
and good for growing feathers.

76
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,028
Want a bite? Hmm?

77
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,291
Say "mango".

78
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,435
Mango.

79
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,153
Mmm. Oh, this good.

80
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,317
Mmm.

81
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,826
All right. Mango, mango, mango.

82
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,955
M-a-n-g-o. Mango.
Are you happy now?

83
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,329
(Gasps and coughs)

84
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,334
Oh, my God.

85
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,805
This is what you've reduced me to.
I've sold out for a piece of fruit.

86
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,639
(Gasping)
I can't believe it. You can talk?

87
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,976
Believe it, Tolstoy, but don't
forget the fruit, the mango.

88
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,573
Give it to me, you mop monkey.

89
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,585
- Oh.
- Bird?

90
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,587
(Bird) Oh, my Lord.

91
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:21,251
What your name is, bird?
Talk to me, bird.

92
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,825
Bird.

93
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,058
The, uh, skin test...

94
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,591
- Excuse me, you are Dr. Reingold?
- Yes, I am.

95
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,695
- I am Misha Belenkoff.
- Hello.

96
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,741
- I have to ask you about a parrot.
- Parrot?

97
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:41,142
The one in the...
down in-in-in dungeon.

98
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,147
Maybe is wrong word. Uh...

99
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,649
- There is a bird down there.
- Mm-hmm.

100
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,651
A green parrot.

101
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,051
Oh, the little conure.
Yeah. Is he still with us?

102
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,785
Yes, I come to tell you,
with great amazement,

103
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,225
he can talk.

104
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,231
- No, he mimics.
- Mimics? What is "mimics"?

105
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,392
He repeats what he hears.
He does not talk.

106
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:06,870
No, he understand.
He's intelligent, Doctor.

107
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,702
I know...

108
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,799
I appreciate your concern, Mister...

109
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,810
- Belenkoff.
- Belenkoff.

110
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,245
But, well, you see these people?

111
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,841
This is what they do.
And this is what I do.

112
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,319
Don't you think if we had an animal
with that kind of intelligence,

113
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,050
somebody would have noticed?

114
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:30,390
I know parrot talk. He sing song.

115
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:34,728
He understand speech.
He even insult me.

116
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:39,066
- He call me mop monkey.
- (Laughing)

117
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,332
He talk.

118
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,908
I can prove you to it.

119
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,679
Would you like some mango?

120
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,143
(Misha) Mango.

121
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,523
(Growls)

122
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,629
(Dr. Reingold) Speak.

123
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,995
(Squawks)

124
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,831
- Speak.
- (Squawks)

125
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,401
No, please, listen, sir.

126
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,642
Maybe if I explain better.
If I say...

127
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,083
I think you've said enough.
Let us do our job and you do yours.

128
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,348
Like, maybe, pick up the trash.

129
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,273
Great. Now we're both in trouble.

130
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,502
What is problem with you?

131
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,909
You know,
maybe they should stuff you,

132
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:59,417
scoop you out, fill you with foam
and glue you to fake tree.

133
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:17,401
You're lonely, I think. I am lonely.

134
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,064
In Russia,
I was teacher of literature.

135
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:25,166
In America,
I am cleaner of bird crap.

136
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,408
I miss words.

137
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,317
I miss my language.

138
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:40,120
I just would like someone to talk to.

139
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,128
- Join the club.
- What?

140
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,528
I said, join the club.

141
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:51,035
So I'm not crazy. You CAN talk.

142
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,368
- Of course I can talk.
- Then why you not?

143
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,101
Because talking
just gets you into trouble.

144
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,804
- Trouble? Why you say that?
- It's a long story.

145
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,643
I'm Russian.

146
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,274
I like long stories.

147
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,479
All right, Chekhov. Sit down.

148
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,487
(Sighing) It all started with Marie.

149
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,527
The one in the song.

150
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,058
Yeah. The one in the song.

151
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,999
(Indistinct talk)

152
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,798
(Woman) Marie!

153
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,669
Marie, come see
what your grandpa brought you.

154
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,651
- (Stuttering) G-G-Grandpa!
- My beautiful girl.

155
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,316
W-What d-did you bring me?

156
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,325
Look in the basket, sweetie.

157
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:52,056
(Paulie) 'I opened my eyes,
and there she was.'

158
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,163
B-Bird.

159
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,168
(Squawking)

160
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,776
(Paulie) 'I didn't know what this
creature was, but I liked it.'

161
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,110
I thought I'd give her someone
to talk to. I named him Paulie.

162
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,117
Pretty P-Paulie.

163
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,147
(Paulie) 'Pretty Marie.'

164
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,886
You w-w-want some?

165
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:34,565
Just mix a little in there, OK?

166
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,573
O-OK.

167
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,574
G-Go down.

168
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,881
D-D-Do y-you like this?

169
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,017
G-G-Good.

170
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,028
G-G-Good boy.

171
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,189
(Chattering)

172
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,360
Marie, can you help Mommy?

173
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,837
This goes on the glass tray.
This goes in the star bowl, OK?

174
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,205
(Background music) # Lonely days
are gone, I'm a-goin' home

175
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,837
# My baby just wrote me a letter

176
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,314
# I don't care how much money
I got with me

177
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,510
# I got to get back to my baby... #

178
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,519
(Mom) Hey, Jerry,
did you get something to drink?

179
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,784
- Here you go, guys.
- Oh, that's great. Thanks.

180
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,557
Marie, can you get that bird
off the table?

181
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,129
Marie.

182
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:36,258
- Paulie's h-helping me.
- He's helping you. I know. I know.

183
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,769
Why don't you two go outside and play
until Daddy gets here?

184
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,637
Y-Y-Y-You like that?

185
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,870
Wait t-t-t-till Daddy sees you.

186
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,079
(Cheering)

187
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,492
There she is. There she is.

188
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,298
She's growin'. Hi, Bunny.

189
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:20,902
- How's my big girl?
- Say hello to your daddy, Marie.

190
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,682
Handshake first, kiss later, OK?

191
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,919
Ooh, that's a strong handshake.

192
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,862
- (Squawking)
- Hey.

193
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,496
When did we get a bird?

194
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,873
G-G-Grandpa g-got him for me.

195
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,709
H-H-His n-name is Paulie.

196
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,884
(Music box)

197
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,863
P-Paulie w-wants a kiss, too.

198
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,628
OK.

199
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,906
# I loved you the first time

200
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:29,140
# I saw you

201
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,809
# And I always...
will love you, Marie #

202
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,892
Good night.

203
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,866
(Door slams)

204
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,905
(Dad) I just cannot believe
you didn't tell me.

205
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,433
(Mom) I wanted to write you.

206
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,412
- Well, then, why didn't you?
- I didn't know what to say.

207
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,712
Is she getting any better?
Is it going away?

208
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,718
No, but it won't go away if you
put too much pressure on her.

209
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,084
I don't think
you put enough pressure on her.

210
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,181
I can't stand to see her suffer.
I can't stand it!

211
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,319
What happens when she goes to school?
Do you think she'll be made fun of?

212
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,957
Because I can guarantee you
that she will be.

213
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,296
You tell me.
What do you think we should do?

214
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,805
I just think all this "we love you
whatever you do" is not gonna help.

215
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:35,112
Great, great. We'll just order
her to stop stuttering? Is that it?

216
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,124
OK, y-y-you are
the fairy godmother,

217
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,250
a-a-and I a-am the princess.

218
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,453
We live in a big castle,

219
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:54,157
a-a-a-and I have
lots of princess dresses.

220
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,234
OK, fairy godmother,
m-make me talk right.

221
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,169
(Door slams)

222
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:08,942
A-A-A-A-And p-p-p-please hurry.

223
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:13,507
All right, Marie. Let's take
your time. There's no hurry, OK?

224
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,019
This is a?

225
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,256
But-ter-fly.

226
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:29,031
(Chuckles) Ball.

227
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,043
Um, I'll tell you what.

228
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,205
I'll let you take
these cards with you,

229
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:47,012
and maybe you'll feel more
comfortable practicing at home.

230
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,854
OK, relax.

231
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,189
Take a deep breath.

232
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,320
Let it out slowly.

233
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,359
Now say "house".

234
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:08,496
H-H-H...

235
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,737
- House, sweetie, house.
- Hey, how are my girls?

236
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,778
Good.

237
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,780
- How's it goin'?
- Good. Very good.

238
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,782
Good.

239
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,988
What are you workin' on?
Cup. That's right.

240
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,649
- Come on. You can say "cup".
- C-C-C...

241
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:30,319
That's right, baby. You can do
it. Look at me. Watch me. Cup.

242
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,832
C-C-C-C...

243
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,662
Cup.

244
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:41,364
Lila, just let her say it.
Why don't you just let her say it?

245
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,536
Look, I'm sorry. You keep
saying it for her. Let her say it.

246
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,910
I'm doing my best!

247
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,542
They told you to say the word?
I don't think so. Let her say it.

248
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,917
Am I supposed to leave
her there totally frustrated?

249
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,582
Cup.

250
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,182
- (Dad) Just let her say the word.
- Cup.

251
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,152
C-up.

252
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,597
Cup.

253
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,230
C-Cup.

254
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,472
You did it, Marie. You did it!

255
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,035
(Paulie) 'All it took was one word
and they shut up.

256
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,083
'I wanted to learn more.'

257
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,414
- What's that?
- Ch-Ch-Chair.

258
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,454
That's a chair. Give me some of that.

259
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,648
- F-F-Fence.
- Fence.

260
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,726
Fl-Flower.

261
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,726
- What about this?
- R-Rock.

262
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,989
Rock. What are those?

263
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,225
- Ew, bugs.
- Don't mind if I do. (Chuckles)

264
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,236
I'm going to the store.
Wanna take a ride with me?

265
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,068
N-N-No. Paulie i-i-is helping me...

266
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,574
learn some new words.

267
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:58,915
No, Bunny, birds don't talk,
and they don't teach, OK?

268
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,111
They just repeat what we say.
They don't understand.

269
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,246
P-P-Paulie understands.

270
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,455
Pretty quiet, aren't you there,
Professor?

271
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:16,056
I was quiet. I'm sorry I was,
but I was afraid of him.

272
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,466
And that's not all I was afraid of.

273
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,663
Come on. Birds fly.

274
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,104
You were afraid to fly?

275
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,267
I was afraid of heights.

276
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,710
- Until I learned a new word.
- What?

277
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,510
- (Gasping)
- What?

278
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,913
No, no, no...

279
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,815
(Paulie)
'I had no idea what it was.'

280
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,319
Bad idea. Very bad.

281
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:41,324
(Paulie) 'But something told me
it was hazardous to my health.'

282
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,657
I see claws and teeth and eyes.
And claws and teeth and eyes.

283
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,891
The claws! Look at those claws.

284
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,763
(Paulie) 'So this flea bag
got run of the place,

285
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,337
'and was allowed
to hang out on the couch

286
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,600
'where me and Marie used to watch TV.

287
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,165
'I was banished to
this very uncomfortable coat rack,

288

'which they called a "perch".'

290
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,212
- (Meowing)
- Hey, kitty, kitty.

291
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:17,053
(Paulie) 'And so began
a lifelong trend of speaking,

00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,359
'when I should've
kept my big beak shut.'

293
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,559
(Paulie) Here, kitty, kitty.
Come on outside.

294
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,535
Come on. We've got some shrimps
on the barbecue for ya.

295
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,402
Right heres. No. Keep... Hey.

296
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,444
Turn around and go outside, you
stupid hair ball. They're calling.

297
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,912
Go on. That's it. Go outside, Muffy
or Pumpkin, or duh...

298
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,915
I don't even know your name.

299
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:44,045
Uh, go, uh, go dig something up
or bury something.

300
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,681
Why are you coming towards me?
No, you...

301
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,090
That's not good. You don't wanna
be on the furniture.

302
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,628
It doesn't match your coat.
(Chuckles) Get down. Get down.

303
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,393
Get down from the furniture.
Get down. You don't even like salad.

304
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,899
That's...

305
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,200
- Ah! Look out!
- (Meowing)

306
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,476
Come on. Leave me alone, cat!
(Laughing)

307
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,548
I wasn't laughing at you.
Come on. Leave me alone.

308
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,083
- (Hissing)
- Stop!

309
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:17,713
- Stop it, you bad cat!
- Stupid hair ball.

310
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,313
- Shoo!
- Yeah, shoo!

311
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,589
I don't think she can
tell the difference

312
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,662
between fantasy and reality.

313
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,323
Come on.

314
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:31,232
You know what she said?
Are you ready for this?

315
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,134
She said the bird told her
the cat started it.

316
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,639
- (Lila) She said that to you?
- Yeah.

317
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,403
Well, she's five years old.
It's her imaginary friend.

318
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,945
I don't know.

319
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,572
She doesn't have any other friends.

320
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,277
She hasn't made
any other attachments.

321
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,353
I just...

322
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:53,515
I really think that we should
consider getting rid of the bird.

323
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,618
I don't know, Warren.
She loves that bird.

324
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,630
She loves that bird.

325
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,039
(Paulie) Now where we goin'?

326
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,440
You have to learn how to fly, Paulie.

327
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,945
No, I don't want to.

328
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,506
- You h-have to.
- Why?

329
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:24,214
So in case you ever go away,
y-you can fly back to me.

330
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:28,315
- Away?
- We h-have to be together, r-right?

331
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,826
- Right.
- Then f-fly.

332
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,962
(Groaning) Oh. You again.

333
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,701
Come on, Paulie. D-Don't look down.

334
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:45,742
Look at the stars.
N-Now spread your wings.

335
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,868
OK.

336
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,173
Don't look down. You could do it.

337
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,182
If it's so easy, why don't you do it?

338
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:56,084
- OK, I'll show you.
- All right, come on.

339
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,320
Hey, good shot. You almost got him.

340
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,864
Anything?

341
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,735
Wow.

342
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:22,838
OK, now spread your wings.
D-Don't look down.

343
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:27,408
OK, ready? One, two, fly!

344
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,784
Come on. Now, fly. Come on, fly.

345
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,620
Whoa, Marie. Look out!

346
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,695
- Marie! Help us, somebody!
- Help!

347
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,287
It's Marie! Help!

348
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,390
(Marie screaming)

349
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,937
- Oh, baby.
- My God.

350
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,370
(Warren) Are you OK?

351
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,442
(Marie crying)

352
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:55,980
(Paulie) 'Marie couldn't talk.
The dad couldn't listen.

353
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,106
'The mom couldn't cope.

354
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,582
'So they got rid of me.'

355
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,123
(Marie) Paulie!

356
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,990
(Paulie) Marie.

357
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,393
- Paulie!
- Marie.

358
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,931
Marie, come back.

359
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,592
- Paulie!
- Marie!

360
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,931
- Paulie!
- Marie!

361
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,098
Paulie!

362
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,109
(Sobbing) Fly back to me!

363
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,343
Paulie!

364
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:35,783
Paulie, I love you! Fly back to me!

365
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:40,620
(Marie sobbing)
Fly back to me, Paulie!

366
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,853
So they bring you here?

367
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,363
Nah, no. It wasn't that easy
hitting rock bottom.

368
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,262
I did a bunch of things.

369
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,768
First, I did a stint
as a window display

370
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,270
in a place called Bloomingdale's.

371
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,102
And I was in a brochure
for Costa Rica.

372
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,609
I did some work as a magician's
assistant doing children's parties,

373
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,475
but when Zintar fell on hard times,

374
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,606
he had to choose
between me and the cape.

375
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,741
Guess which one he pawned.

376
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:11,117
# What's new, pussycat,
whoa, whoa, whoa #

377
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,050
Shut up, you goddamn flying rat,
shut up.

378
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,027
# Pussycat, pussycat,
you are delicious

379
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,757
# And if my wishes
could all come... #

380
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,598
May you're uncomfortable in there?
Maybe you need a change.

381
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,661
How about this nice toaster oven
for top brown only?

382
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,536
Come on, Artie.
We haven't pawned anything all day.

383
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,406
Let's catch the number nine
at Belmont. I'm bored.

384
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,878
- You and me both.
- I wanna go home.

385
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,380
Get on line.

386
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,386
Yo, Artie, today is your lucky day.

387
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,150
Right. Fresh outta the showroom,
right? Where's the receipt?

388
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,657
- Lost it.
- Ten bucks.

389
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,387
Ten bucks? Come on, gimme a break.

390
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,986
I'm trying to upgrade
the level of your merchandise.

391
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,157
(Paulie) Hit the brakes, ugly.

392
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,430
Cute. Do you train the bird
to insult your customers?

393
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:02,199
No, I could tell you're ugly
all by myself.

394
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,709
- How'd he do that?
- He watches television.

395
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,508
What an angle.

396
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,674
I could see how his unique skills
could really...

397
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,685
come in handy
to an intelligent guy, huh?

398
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,722
(Paulie) Yeah, I'll let you know
when I see one.

399
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,121
How much you want for him, Artie?

400
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,285
A lot more than ten bucks, baby.

401
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:27,125
You'd have to grift for more
than a year to make his numbers.

402
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,200
OK, which of you three
is the proprietor?

403
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,235
Very funny, toots.
What do you got there?

404
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,932
Oh, this is my easel.
It's a very fine one.

405
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,304
My late husband got it for me,

406
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,969
and I really hate to part with it,
you know?

407
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:47,245
Yeah, whatever. Dead husband aside,
do you wanna pawn or sell?

408
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,149
Well...

409
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,812
The real question is,

410
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,052
are you prepared to throw in
that potholder on your head?

411
00:29:56,327 --> 00:30:01,560
Well, that was extremely rude.

412
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,566
Did you teach him that?

413
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:06,136
No. That's the thing.
The dirty mouth is all his.

414
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,340
What are you looking at?

415
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:15,240
You know,
I think I'll take him with me.

416
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,645
Well, I don't think so, lady.
See, I saw the bird first.

417
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,277
Oh, no, no. I'm afraid you are not
the right owner for him.

418
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,948
Somebody has to teach
this beautiful bird some manners.

419
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,649
Might as well be me.

420
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,024
What's wrong with my manners? (Burps)

421
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,587
(Paulie) All right.
Let me out now, Grandma.

422
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:38,658
- Very funny. Let me go. Joke's over.
- Hey, stop that.

423
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,603
Keep it up
and you'll be in a cage yourself.

424
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,606
- Come on, would you let me out?
- Hush.

425
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:47,508
Padre, you see this broad?
She's a birdnapper. Let me out!

426
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,811
Somebody check this lady's purse.
I bet she's got a hamster in there.

427
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,816
- Get out. Scram.
- Thank you. Jeez.

428
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,818
- Where are you going?
- Home.

429
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,150
- Are you gonna walk all the way?
- That's right.

430
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,781
Well, why don't you fly?
It's a lot faster.

431
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,726
Can't fly.
# Cha, cha-cha-cha, cha... #

432
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,788
You can talk, but you can't fly.
All right, see you around.

433
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,130
All right. See ya.

434
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,704
- (Bell ringing)
- (Squawking)

435
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,966
(Humming)

436
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:21,205
Uh, you know what?
I thought it over, and I'm back.

437
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,671
Besides,
I don't know where she lives.

438
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,808
- Where who lives?
- Marie.

439
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,253
She's all alone,
and we're supposed to stick together.

440
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,456
Do you think you could use
a little bit of help?

441
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,689
Yes.

442
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:43,791
- Yes, what?
- Yes, toots.

443
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,531
- Mm, "yes, please".
- Man, you're needy.

444
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,575
Alweather, Alweather, Alweath...
Alweather!

445
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:56,443
Oh, are we in luck. There's
only one Alweather in this book,

446
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,777
and it's pretty close by.

447
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,444
What do you say we just go over
and surprise her?

448
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,848
Recognize anything?

449
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,449
That's it. That's the house.

450
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,859
That's it, that's it, that's it.
That's the one!

451
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,560
Oh, dear.

452
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:49,123
I'm sorry, dear. They've moved away.

453
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,828
- Away?
- Mm-hmm. To Los Angeles.

454
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:56,304
All right, well,
let's get back in the cab, huh?

455
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:01,071
Oh, no. It's clear across
the country. It's 3,000 miles.

456
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,874
Please.

457
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:09,911
I'm afraid "please"
just won't work in this situation.

458
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,856
(Woman) But, what's the matter
with New Jersey?

459
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,751
It's nice, if you give it a chance.

460
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,761
(Thunderclap)

461
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,800
Why does your house have wheels?

462
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,370
Houses are cheaper with wheels.

463
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,838
I was thinking more along the lines

464
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,535
that houses with wheels
can go places.

465
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:37,137
Well, not anymore, I'm afraid.

466
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:41,480
Earl and I used to travel
all of the time, you know?

467
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,884
But things change.

468
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:48,015
He had even crazier ideas
than you have.

469
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,960
We always used to talk about
going to the Grand Canyon,

470
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:56,261
but we just never got that far.

471
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:01,532
Earl said that if you stand right at
the edge just when the sun comes up,

472
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,837
it's like seeing the first sunrise
in the whole world.

473
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:09,709
- He was kind of poetic, wasn't he?
- For an ex-Marine.

474
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,374
Hmm, you miss Earl.

475
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,748
- Oh, let's not talk about that.
- You miss Earl.

476
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:19,186
Eat your dinner.

477
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,758
Like I miss Marie.

478
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,395
(Sighs)

479
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,557
- Ready?
- Ready!

480
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,863
(Engine starts)

481
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,531
- So long, Jersey!
- So long, Jersey!

482
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:40,372
(Paulie chattering, whooping)

483
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,583
(Paulie) 'I thought flying was scary
until I drove with Ivy.

484
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,914
'Now, that's scary.'

485
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,480
Ah, yes. You and I are right here,

486
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,719
and Marie is right there.

487
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:00,093
Right there. Well, not...
You know, not literally.

488
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:04,066
This is a map - an atlas.
It's a book full of maps.

489
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,931
I'll teach you about books.

490
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,732
(Paulie) 'Ivy was a great teacher.

491
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,898
'She was a philosopher, an explorer.

492
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:13,170
'Unfortunately,
she also thought she was a singer.'

493
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,246
# He has tramped upon the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored

494
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,872
# He has loosed
the fateful lightning... #

495
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,316
Please. I'm a bird. I have a small
brain, and it's about to explode.

496
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,320
# His truth goes marching on #

497
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,356
(Paulie) Let's try something
a little more classby.

498
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:30,223
(Both) # What's new pussycat,
whoa, whoa, whoa

499
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:36,699
# What's new pussycat,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

500
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:41,394
# Pussycat, pussycat,
I've got flowers

501
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:45,408
# And lots of hours
to spend with you

502
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,002
# So go and powder
your cute little pussycat nose... #

503
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,104
(Paulie)
So when will we get there?

504
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,412
(Ivy)
Maybe that's the wrong question.

505
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,452
Maybe we should be asking,

506
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,920
"What are we gonna see
along the way?

507
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,992
"What wrong turn are we gonna make...

508
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:06,291
"that will take us
someplace unexpected?

509
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:11,259
"Will the weather be for us,
or will it be against us?

510
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,428
"Will we lose faith?

511
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:17,702
"Will we get there, or won't we?"

512
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,208
- You're scaring me.
- (Chuckling)

513
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,303
It's good to be scared sometimes.

514
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,405
Put your wings up.

515
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,946
That's it. Very good.

516
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:33,353
You should learn how to fly, Paulie.

517
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:37,018
The last time someone suggested
that, it didn't work out so good.

518
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,291
You're missing out on something
that's probably pretty great.

519
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,299
Hey, why don't you try it
and let me know.

520
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:48,462
- Are you tired?
- A little bit.

521
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:04,185
(Paulie) The desert is fun.
What is the biggest desert?

522
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,486
It's the North Pole. It doesn't
have to be hot to be a desert.

523
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,983
It just has to not have rainfall.

524
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,622
Could we stop at
the world's largest ball of twine?

525
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,667
That'd probably be more
fun than Mount Rushmore.

526
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:20,464
There's a truck up ahead.
Don't those guys ever get tired?

527
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,937
Ivy, look out! Get outta the way!

528
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,801
Oh!

529
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,116
(Sighing) Oh.

530
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:51,728
(Paulie) You know, maybe your
house shouldn't have wheels.

531
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,895
Oh, dear.

532
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:58,908
All right, all right.
I'll go get some help.

533
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,844
You stay here. You know, it's...
Don't be frightened.

534
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,847
Let's see.

535
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,227
(Paulie) 'For all
of her pleases and thank yous,

536
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,820
'words weren't
really that important to Ivy.

537
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,195
'It's what she saw that mattered.

538
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,895
'Seems to me, the way it works out,

539
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:30,406
'it's the things you love most
that are the things they take away.'

540
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:37,046
(Ivy) The doctor says
I really mustn't drive any more.

541
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,878
You'll just have to
go ahead without me.

542
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:45,251
Los Angeles is due west from here,
right into the setting sun.

543
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:49,349
I can be your eyes.
I can watch the road for you.

544
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,428
Besides, I can't go without you.

545
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,431
Oh, of course you can.

546
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:02,165
I'm not very good at good-byes, dear,
so I think you should go now.

547
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:07,176
Just right now. And you send me
a postcard when you get there.

548
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,746
(Ivy) Where did I put that comb?

549
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,263
Oh.

550
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,106
Thank you.

551
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,046
(Paulie) 'And so I stayed.'

552
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,743
(Ivy) We nearly home yet?

553
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,948
(Paulie)
Go to your left here. There you go.

554
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:58,222
You know what you are, Paulie?
You're my seeing-eye parrot.

555
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,964
You've been a dear friend to me,
Paulie.

556
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,402
We're birds of a feather, you and I.

557
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:12,237
Betwixt and between, that's us.

558
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:17,212
So what do we have tonight?
Is it pretty?

559
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,214
Oh, very pretty.

560
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,513
There's more orange now,
and it's getting darker.

561
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,645
Just a little gold left.

562
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,315
The sun must almost be set.

563
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,124
- Can you see any stars yet?
- Not yet.

564
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,692
(Paulie)
'And then one day, the cat got her.'

565
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,446
Oh.

566
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,421
(Paulie) 'There are
things in life you put off,

you're gonna do them later.

'But the real thing Ivy taught me

573
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,485
So, you flew all the way here?

574
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,181
(Paulie) Yep, all the way.

575
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,418
- Is long way to go by yourself.
- Tell me about it.

576
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,756
So what you did next?

577
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:55,195
Ivy introduced me
to a lot of wonderful things,

578
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,860
but, you know, she left
one very important thing out.

Hi, I'm Paulie. Uh, Paul.

587
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,817
Could you help me?
I'm a little lost.

Me llamo Lupe.
Soy una pajara muy bonita.

00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:03,294
Huh? Uh, maybe we got off
to a bad start.

590
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,461
Look, my name's Paulie, and I'm
a little lost. I need some help.

591
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:11,268
Hey, wait. Where you going?
Hey, wait for me.

(Man) Hey, you guys, knock it off.
What are you doing? What's going on?

595
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,292
Oh.

596
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,197
Hey, you, come on down here.

597
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,198
Yeah, you. Come on.

598
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:41,203
OK, what's your story?

599
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,638
Uh, yes. Uh, I'm looking for
someone named Marie Alweather.

600
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,007
But I'm afraid I may be lost.
Can you tell me where I am?

601
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,745
(Chuckles)

602
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:58,151
You're in L.A. East L.A.

603
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:02,055
L. A? L. A! Oh, my gosh, I made it!

604
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,389
I made it! L. A! I don't believe it!

605
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:08,898
I don't believe it. You can talk?

606
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,297
They talk.

607
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,301
Them? (Chuckles)

608
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:16,372
They don't talk. I say "taco."
They say "taco."

609
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:20,705
- (Together) Taco, taco, taco.
- Are they OK?

610
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,803
Sure, they're OK.

611
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:28,408
I don't know about me.
I'm talking to a bird.

612
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,046
OK, I'm talking to a bird.

613
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:40,192
- Is her daddy's name Moe?
- Uh-uh. Warren.

614
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,197
Oh.

615
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:46,201
Well, I'm sorry, amigo. Such
an Alweather is not in this book.

616
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,771
Maybe they have an unlisted number.

(Squawking)

618
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,470
Hmm. Pero, ¿sabes qué?

619
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,638
You know what I was thinking?

620
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:02,117
- Can you carry a tune or dance?
- What do you mean?

621
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,586
Get ready to turn. Da. Turn.

622

(Humming)

623
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,055
OK, that's it. Come on.

00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,931
- (Squawking)
- No.

626
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,732
(Sighs) Tell you what.

627
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,572
Why don't we have one guy on each
end, and then Lupe in the middle?

628
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:31,205
OK, uh, Chaco, uh, Paco, hello?

629
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,977
- Come on. Talk to them.
- I'm trying.

630
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,883
- Talk to them in parrot.
- What?

631
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,751
Talk in parrot,
so they'll understand.

632
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:43,088
- Talk parrot? Right.
- Yeah. Come on now.

633
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,153
OK... (Whistling) Hey,
where you going? What'd I say?

634
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:51,098
- Man, what did you say?
- I don't know. I don't talk parrot.

635
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,965
Hey! Hey, Paulie! Where did you go?

636
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,404
Hey, all of you! Get your little
feathered butts back in here.

637
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:01,170
We gotta rehearse.
You think this stuff just happens?

638
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:10,185
(Clears throat)
Uh, I really like you a lot.

639
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,188
(Yellow bird)
I really like you a lot.

640
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,451
Wow. I'm so glad you feel that way.

641
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,756
(Giggling)
Wow. I'm so glad you feel that way.

642
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:22,525
- Are you listening?
- Are you listening?

643
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:26,569
- Or are you just repeating?
- (Laughing)

644
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,367
(Misha) Well, women can be tough.

645
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,873
(Paulie) Tell me about it.

646
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:35,433
So, how do you know
if you've met the right one?

647
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,946
Well, for me...

648
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,950
Let me see.

649
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,044
She would be pretty, but smart.

650
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:50,218
She would have books on her table
and flowers in her hair.

651
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,728
- And...
- And lots of golden feathers.

652
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,197
Well, yes, important
to have high standard.

653
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,235
- So, Misha, you got a girlfriend?
- No.

654
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:03,466
Well, once. Little bit.

655
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:06,667
What? How do you have
a little bit of a girlfriend?

656
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,007
- Well...
- This is interesting. Go on.

657
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:14,674
Before I'm coming to America,
there was girl.

658
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,221
We were student together
at university.

659
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:23,692
Sure, we talk about books.
We even fight about them.

660
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,922
She was very smart. And stubborn.

661
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,021
I say book mean one thing.

662
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,660
She say, "No, Misha.
Book mean other thing."

663
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,832
One time, she act in play...

664
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,910
in front of whole school.

665
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:45,914
I was working behind curtain,
in dark.

666
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:50,350
I see her on stage.

667
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:55,551
She had little flowers
in her hair...

668
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,891
and the light make them all...

669
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,897
different color.

670
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:08,536
And I say to myself,
"My God, she's beautiful.

671
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:15,709
"Maybe too beautiful for me,
but I will tell her how I feel."

672
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:22,575
Afterward,
when I'm come near to her...

673
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,883
She stole your words away.

674
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,084
Yes.

675
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,688
She marry my best friend.

676
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,825
He told her how he feel.

677
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:44,966
At wedding,
she take me aside and say,

678
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:50,342
"Misha, I always like you best,

679
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,348
"but I was afraid...

680
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,351
"afraid of your silence."

681
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,093
It's important to speak up.

682
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,797
So, you're going to tell me
what happened to Lupe,

683
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,927
or shall I go sweep more floor?

684
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,937
(Paulie) OK, OK.

685
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:19,774
(Singing in Spanish)

686
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:25,041
(Paulie) 'So I had a girl in L.A.,
all the mangos I could eat.

687
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:28,083
'Everything was going great.
But you know how it is.

688
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,784
'Soon as you think you're OK,

689
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,516
'the past comes back to bite
your tail feathers.'

690
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,081
- Come on. Let's go, will ya?
- Yeah.

691
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:45,163
(Singing in Spanish)

692
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,732
Come on, come on. Sit down.

693
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,608
What are we doing here?
You never take me any place nice.

694
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,116
What are you talking about?
This is nice. Look at this.

695
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,117
Because you're a loser, that's why.

696
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,983
Would you stop with the loser.
I'm not a loser.

697
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,386
I'm just lookin' for the right angle.

698
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,322
Angle. Listen to you.

699
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:13,062
Hey, could I get a drink today, huh?

700
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,757
(Continues singing in Spanish)

701
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,063
Any drink, please. Somebody.

702
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,008
Did you see that?

703
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,346
I think I know that bird
from somewhere.

704
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:50,526
Hey, taco guy! Come on!

705
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,864
Come over here! Yeah.

706
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,767
Hey, I'll give you $50
for that green parrot over there.

707
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,602
- What? For Paulie?
- I don't know. Yeah.

708
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,176
No, I'm sorry, señor,
he's not for sale.

709
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:04,042
50 bucks. Use it for something.
He's a parrot.

710
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,047
He could get lost
or get eaten by a goat.

711
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:08,049
This way, you got something
to show for him.

712
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:11,848
Like I said, thank you,
but he's not for sale.

713
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,355
You know what?
Maybe you can help me, though.

714
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,948
My bird is looking for his friend,
Marie Alweather.

715
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,153
Do you know anybody by that name?

716
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,662
- Alweather? In East L. A?
- Sí. Sí.

717
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,233
- What a jerk.
- OK, well, gracias.

718
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,495
Come on, taco man.
I'm just joking around.

719
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:29,003
Come on. 50 bucks.

720
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,003
Everybody wants
a piece of the action, huh?

721
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,273
You know, I was thinking
about costumes, you know?

722
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,474
What about
a little fruit hat for Lupe?

723
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:44,714
You know, like that...
what's her name... Dolores Del Rio.

724
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:50,084
What's the matter, my friend?

725
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:53,685
Mm, I know. You're thinking
about Marie, huh?

726
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:57,460
No, I was thinking about Lupe
wearing nothing but that fruit hat.

727
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,795
You are some kind of weird bird,
my friend.

728
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,137
But tonight, we sing, hmm?
Have a big time.

729
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,180
(Paulie)
'Ignacio was all right for a human.

730
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,340
'He knew me better
than I knew myself.

731
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,476
'I hadn't forgotten Marie,
but I got a little sidetracked.

732
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,578
'I had the prettiest parrot in L.A.
interested only in me,

00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:23,284
'I was in show business, and
for once in my life, I was a bird.'

(Lupe) # Estoy loca
(Ignacio) # She's crazy

# Mucho crazy

Cops? Yeah, how ya doin'?

744
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:58,990
I don't normally do this.
I'm just trying to be a good citizen.

745
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:02,292
You know what I mean?
I'm down here at this taco stand,

746
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,867
and I gotta be honest,
it's pretty disgusting.

747
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:07,494
There's no floor,
no roof, no bathrooms.

748
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:11,734
And I gotta be honest, there's gotta
be 1,000 maniacs running around here.

749
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:14,469
There's rats the size of footballs,

750
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:16,842
and a guy's serving alcohol
to children.

751
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:18,937
Is that allowed? I didn't think so.

752
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:22,644
Why don't you come and help me out?
I'm tryin' to do a good deed.

761
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:58,919
Police! Hey, look! It's the cops!
Come on! Let's get out of here!

762
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,218
(Screaming, chattering)

763
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:04,157
(Paulie) Hey, what's goin' on?
Where's everybody goin'

764
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,490
Go on! Get out of here!

765
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,860
Lupe, you dropped your hat!

766
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,864
(Paulie) Come on!
Come on, let me out of here!

767
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,869
Where am I?

768
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:19,667
Would you let me out of here,
please?

769
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:23,872
- Who are you?
- I'm Benny. You don't remember me?

770
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,383
- Think back. The pawn shop?
- Where's Ignacio?

771
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,976
Who knows? He's probably
halfway to Guatemala by now.

772
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,419
- Why?
- Because he's an illegal.

773
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,617
Oh, yeah?
And what does that make you?

774
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:40,059
(Sighs) Look, pal.

775
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:43,724
You're going about finding
your friend Marie the wrong way.

776
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:47,064
You got dreams, man.
I respect that. I got dreams.

777
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,833
You're never gonna find your friend
from singing under sombreros.

778
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,374
If you want something,
you gotta do more than just dream.

779
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,376
You gotta get out there.
You gotta take it.

780
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,378
- Take it?
- Yeah, take it.

781
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,005
That's the only way
we'll get a piece of the pie.

782
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,516
- I like pie.
- What?

783
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,746
I said, "I like pie."

784
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:08,290
Yeah, I like pie, too.

785
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,201
Look at the size of this place, man.

786
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,202
(Engine shuts off)

787
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:24,467
- You're not gonna kiss me, are ya?
- What? Get outta here.

788
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,941
If you wanna find Marie, you're
gonna need lots of the green stuff.

789
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,842
- Green stuff?
- Yeah, green stuff.

790
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,643
- Money.
- What for?

791
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,241
What for? For phone books.

792
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:40,220
That's how you find somebody. You
gotta look 'em up in a phone book.

793
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:41,813
It's very expensive.

794
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,759
It's not like somebody comes and
drops a bunch on your doorstep.

795
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,227
Come on, Benny!

796
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:51,631
Hey, what if she ain't
in the phone book? That's what...

797
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:54,328
Then you gotta hire some private
detective or something.

798
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,032
I don't know, pal.
It's a very expensive operation.

799
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,512
Don't worry, though.
We'll find Marie.

800
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:07,310
Just gotta come up
with the right plan.

801
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,510
(Paulie) 'Benny had a lot of plans.

802
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:13,282
'Most of 'em stunk, but the one
about hiring a detective was good.

803
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,751
'I figured, for the right amount
of green stuff,

804
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,624
'any detective worth his trench coat
could find her.

805
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:22,163
'So, we became a team.'

806
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:29,863
Five, zero, seven, zero.

807
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,416
- Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Watch where you're goin'.

808
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,153
I'm sorry. Excuse me. OK.

809
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,583
(Paulie) 'Benny said money was the
most important thing in the world.

810
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:22,021
'So, deep down, people would
understand if you stole it.

811
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:26,662
'Towards the end of the month, the
pickings were always a little slim.

812
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:30,597
'I don't know if that's cos they
spent it all or cos we stole it.'

813
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,659
(Beeping, buzzing)

814
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,234
Move it along, fella.
You're broke. Come on.

815
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:48,216
(Paulie) 'But the real problem
in all of this was Benny.

816
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,048
'He was a small-timer
any way you looked at it.

817

'Jumpin' up and down over 20s
when there were bigger fish to fry.'

818
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,849
- (Seagulls screeching)
- (Benny and Paulie laughing)

819
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,987
Get 'em! Get 'em!

820
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,861
I gotta tell you, Paulie. God!

821
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,867
You are the greatest thing
to ever happen to me, man.

822
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,096
Hey, thanks, man.

823
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:11,367
No, I'm serious, Paulie.
You're the best.

824
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:16,070
Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt
your little testosterone festival,

825
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,079
but the bird hasn't made us
that much money.

826
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:22,550
Hello? What are you talking about,
"that much money"? We're doin' great!

827
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:26,645
I should be, like,
lounging by a pool in a mansion,

828
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:30,123
wearing a mink coat and,
like, 18-karat diamond earrings.

829
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,923
She's right. We're wasting our time,
when there are rocks to be grifted.

830
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:39,463
- What do you know about diamonds?
- We met in a pawnshop, Einstein.

831
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,732
You can tell a real diamond
from a fake?

832
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,897
Yeah.

833
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:46,771
I've seen shot glasses
cut better than that.

834
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:51,811
I cannot believe you, Benito.

835
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:55,850
You're gonna get me a real diamond,
and you're gonna help him.

836
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,887
Diamonds?
Ruby, it's a little out of my league.

837
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,616
Your league, but not his.

838
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,691
(Ruby) Park right there.
(Benny) Where?

839
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,819
(Paulie) 'Finally, these
canary brains got the right idea.

840

restaurant for a burrito

'before the big heist.'

843
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,068
(Paulie) Would you hurry up?

844
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,437
- 'That was a bad idea.'
- (Paulie) Hurry up. Pull over.

845
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,477
(Farts)

846
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:25,346
(Paulie) Sorry.

847
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:28,144
Paulie, would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

848
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:31,414
- OK.
- There you are. All right, come on.

849
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,013
I'll talk to you in a second, pal.

850
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,918
(Benny) Do you think
that's a good idea? A chimney?

851
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,156
It's not exactly parrot-friendly.
He could twist an ankle.

852
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,530
What is your problem, Benito?
He's a freakin' bird! Just tell him.

853
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,034
- Now?
- Now!

854
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,365
All right.

855
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:59,010
- That Ruby's high maintenance.
- (Chuckles) Yeah.

856
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:03,075
Hey, but after tonight, we'll have
enough money to find your Marie.

857
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,587
Come on,
who's the coolest bird in L. A?

858
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:09,351
- Get out of town.
- Paulie's my main man. Right?

859
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,087
Dude.

860
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,390
Go on, Paulie.
Get the jewelry for us.

861
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,757
Go ahead, buddy. Go ahead.

862
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,946
Here comes Santa!

863
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,447
(Grunts and coughs)

864
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,911
(Sneezes)

865
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,988
(Paulie) 'The most important thing

866
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:43,150
'is to leave nothing that links you
to the scene of the crime.'

Maybe I should go, you know?
See if he's OK, you know?

879
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:22,053
- I'm gonna go see if he's OK.
- Benny!

880

Hold it right there. Turn around.

881

Put 'em up! Drop it!

with Grandma's necklace?

- Open the window!

Don't leave me! I'm stuck in here!
Benny, the kid's got a weapon!

Come on, would you
let me out of the box?

- He talked up a storm on the way.
- I'm sure.

898
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:23,844
- Take a look at this little fellow.
- Jeez.

899
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,982
Oh.

900
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,251
Little conure.

901

Does he have a name?

902
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,955
Yeah, Paulie.

903
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:41,464
- So, he flew down your chimney.
- Well, that's what he told me.

904
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,470
Ah. (Chuckles)

905
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:46,541
Well, many parrots have quite
extensive vocabularies,

906
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:50,339
but there's a difference between
cognizant speech and parroting.

907
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:51,937
(Paulie) "Aviator Supply Center."

908
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:55,245
He keeps talking
about a Marie Alweather.

909
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,819
- (Paulie) Hey.
- I think she might be his owner.

910
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,286
Well, that's not unusual, either.

911
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:04,155
Lots of people train their birds
to repeat names...

912
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,160
and addresses in case they get lost.

913
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,890
- I'm sure that's the case.
- Do you have a phone book?

914
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,299
- Pardon?
- Please?

915
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:15,029
He's very polite.

916
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:18,800
I'm sure that's
just a trained response.

917
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,172
But I'd like to keep him here
a few days...

918
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:24,337
and maybe, uh, run some tests.

919
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,813
Build him up a bit.
He looks a little undernourished.

920
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,816
But, uh, don't worry.

921
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,512
You did the right thing
bringing him here, Gerald.

922
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,020
- We'll take good care of him.
- OK.

923
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:37,320
I want you to understand
what it is we do here.

924
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:41,157
Mostly we just listen and we watch.

925
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:46,132
You see, there's this gap
between animals and humans.

926
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:49,227
And the gap is called speech.

927
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:53,468
Now, if that gap could be bridged,
we could truly understand each other.

928
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,443
Won't you consider helping us?

929
01:06:56,545 --> 01:07:01,039
Tell you what. I'm gonna have
you moved out of here tonight.

930
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,675
And I promise you,

931
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,313
I will take you to see Marie
when we're done.

932
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,721
Maybe I'm the one
who should be locked up.

933
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,956
You promise?

934
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:24,706
I promise.

935
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,707
(Man) We're going to
ask you some questions.

936
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:30,301
We'd like for you
to identify the picture.

937
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,472
- What is this?
- Duck.

938
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:38,983
- What is this?
- Kite. Umbrella.

939
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,250
I don't see
how this is bridging the gap.

940
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:45,316
I know this is frustrating,
but we have to follow protocol

941
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,659
to prove that you're capable
of cognizant speech.

942
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,029
Everyone can see that I can talk.

943
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,332
- What is this?
- Now, what is that word again...

944
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,342
for a dish composed of meat,
fowl, fish or vegetables,

945
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,344
covered in a layer of paste
and baked?

946
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:06,040
Oh, yeah. It's a pie. Then again,

947
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:09,515
a pie can be a magpie,
a collection of rules, a copper coin

948
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:12,246
or what you call a fine lookin' lady.

949
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:14,754
And if you don't believe me,
look it up, blondie.

950
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,553
Pie can also mean a whole, as in
the pie of which we crave a piece,

951
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,187
like the whole enchilada,
the big salami, the grand prize.

952
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:24,357
The talking bird which you hope
will make you rich. That kind of pie.

953
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,628
Me! I'm the pie here.
And if you don't mind...

954
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,033
taking your fingers
out of me for a moment,

955
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,164
I'd like to get some lunch,
you lab rat!

956
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,175
How do I score that?

957
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:40,374
You said that?

958
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:43,543
I told you,
talking just gets you into trouble.

959
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:46,120
No. It's not that.

960
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:51,891
It's how you say things.
You have to be careful.

961
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,563
Woman say, "You like my hat?"

962
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,155
You say,
"No, make you look like floor lamp."

963
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:00,167
You get punch in nose.

964
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,567
I got worse than that.

965
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:07,967
- (Snoring)
- (Door opens and closes)

966
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,572
(Dialing phone)

967
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,981
(Reingold)
Yes, Dr. Manning, he's asleep.

968
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,953
- Yeah, this will put us on the map.
- (Grunt)

969
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,182
This will change everything.
I'm telling you,

970
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:25,317
he is the most extraordinary
creature I have ever encountered.

971
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:28,828
Yeah, well,
I have grant committees

972
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:31,331
from the N.I.H. and the N.S.F.

973
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:35,301
Some guy from the National Geographic
is talking about a special.

974
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,304
(Chuckling)

975
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,533
Mmm.

976
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:43,976
Actually, I have located the owner.
It's Marie Alweather.

977
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,639
- She lives in Cambria, California.
- Marie?

978
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:50,116
Uh, yes.

979
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,119
Yes, I understand.

980
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,358
No, I agree.

981
01:09:56,425 --> 01:10:00,691
There's no legal requirement
that we have to return him.

982
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,958
He's the property
of the Institute now.

983
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,659
(Paulie) What?

984
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,628
- So, I'll see you tomorrow.
- (Paulie) Property?

985
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:11,365
OK. Bye-bye. (Hangs up)

986
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:15,000
It is the thing that makes us us.

987
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,943
And because language is so tied...

988
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,038
to what it is to be human,

989
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:23,550
we have always been urged not
to attribute human characteristics,

990
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:26,553
like consciousness
and logic and feelings,

991
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:29,182
to our non-speaking animal subjects.

992
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,418
Until now.

993
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:36,126
What we are proposing...

994
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:39,201
is a multidisciplinary
research program,

995
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:44,034
that will not only unlock
the mystery of animal communication,

996
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,505
but get to the heart
of language itself.

997
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:50,204
And just as every journey
starts with a single step,

998
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:53,406
this program starts with a single,
extraordinary subject.

999
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:57,349
- Hello, Paulie. How are you today?
- (Squawk!) Paulie want a cracker!

1000
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:01,014
(Laughing)

1001
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:04,058
I thought you liked mangos the best.

1002
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,286
(Paulie) Paulie want a cracker.

1003
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:10,354
(Chuckling) Well, we can get
a lot of crackers later.

1004
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,559
Let's, uh, take a look
at the flash cards.

1005
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,568
(Paulie)
'They wanted a talking bird? Fine.

1006
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,138
'I was gonna give them
a talking bird.'

1007
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,139
- What is this?
- Up yours.

1008
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:22,142
- What is this?
- Up yours, jackass!

1009
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:25,441
- (Indistinct chattering)
- This is just opening-night jitters.

1010
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,480
- What are you doing?
- Up yours!

1011
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,786
- Why are you doing this?
- You promised.

1012
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:40,059
Liar. Liar!

1013
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:42,824
Liar! Liar! Liar!

1014
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,991
Liar! Liar!

1015
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,296
- Close the door!
- (Gasping)

1016
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,274
Can't have him
trying to fly away again.

1017
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,610
He could seriously injure himself.

1018
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,979
(Grunting)

1019
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,426
I'm just gonna cut a few primary
flight feathers. It won't hurt.

1020
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:16,089
No. Oh, come on. (Grunting)

1021
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:20,931
- This is for your own good.
- Don't! (Grunting)

1022
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:22,970
(Paulie) 'They were cutting me.

1023
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:26,667
'They were taking away the one thing
that made me different from them.'

1024
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,542
(Crying) No!

1025
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:37,976
(Paulie)
I never talked to anybody again.

1026
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:41,784
Then when I started biting people,
they moved me out of the sun.

1027
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:46,119
When was that?

1028
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,753
I can't even remember.

1029
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:54,000
(Door opens)

1030
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:58,165
(Virgil) Wrap it up down there.
Don't forget to lock up.

1031
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,041
We will find your Marie.

1032
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,215
That's what they all said.

1033
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,590
Now, we'll get you out, Paulie.

1034
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,597
What... What are you...

1035
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:26,190
What are you doing, Misha? Come on.

1036
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,361
I don't think you know
what you're doing.

1037
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,337
They could have you deported.
Come on, Misha.

1038
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,670
You're making too much noise.

1039
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:37,837
You're destroying laboratory
property. They're gonna fire you!

1040
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,773
Misha.

1041
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:54,693
(Panting) Come, Paulie. Come on.

1042
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,698
Don't be afraid.

1043
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,568
Come.

1044
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,507
Come, Paulie.

1045
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,516
Let's go.

1046
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,565
You tell me Dr. Reingold
find where Marie lives.

1047
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:35,228
Maybe address is still in his office.

1048
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,681
Not in "Paulie" file.
Not in "Parrot" file.

1049
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,846
Not in any bird file.

1050
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:56,322
Look in the human file.
Look under little girls.

1051
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:00,088
- Look in the "Marie" file.
- "Marie?"

1052
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:03,631
Alweather. Alweather!

1053
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:12,796
(Misha) Marie Alweather. M.A.

1054
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,846
What? What is it?

1055
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:33,288
"M.A."

1056
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:35,522
M.A. Marie Alweather.

1057
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:39,567
1440 Spruce Lane,
Cambria, California.

1058
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,816
Hello?

1059
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:59,820
Excuse me, please.
Sorry I'm calling so early.

1060
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,152
Does Marie Alweather live there?

1061
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,459
(Paulie) Marie?

1062
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:09,595
Can you tell her I found Paulie.

1063
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,360
Marie! Marie! Hey, Marie, it's me!

1064
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,231
- Shh.
- Marie! Marie! It's me, Paulie!

1065
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,237
(Laughing and cheering)

1066
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:21,298
No, uh, l-l-I'm telling you...

1067
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:25,471
- Paulie. I found him.
- Marie! Marie! Marie!

1068
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,572
What do you think you're doing?

1069
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:33,221
Uh, I've come cleaning office. So...
But I later come back.

1070
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,848
What's the bird doing
out of his cage?

1071
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,391
Well...

1072
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,362
Get the bird.

1073
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,263
Come on.

1074
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:49,234
- Look, just grab...
- No. No!

1075
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,806
- (Squawking)
- No! Hey!

1076
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,467
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm taking him.

1077
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:56,874
- You're what?
- I'm taking him where he belongs.

1078
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:59,573
He belongs to the Institute.

1079
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:03,139
No, he belongs to little girl
who needs him.

1080
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:06,812
And you knew.
You knew it all the time.

1081
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,755
Paulie, come.

1082
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,917
Who do you think you are?

1083
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:18,828
I am Mikeal Andreovich Belenkoff.

1084
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:22,426
And you are a liar and a coward
and a very rude man.

1085
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:24,562
And you're fired.

1086
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:28,165
No. No. I am not fire.

1087
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:30,972
- I am quit.
- You...

1088
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,686
(Paulie) Uh-oh.

1089
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,188
Stop that man!

1090
01:17:57,472 --> 01:18:00,168
It's locked!

1091
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:03,108
- (Knocking)
- Get out of the way!

1092
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,385
Get somebody!

1093
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,334
(Reingold) Open this door!

1094
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:30,030
Open this door!

1095
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,412
(Reingold) Don't do this!

1096
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,913
- Paulie.
- Wait.

1097
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:53,051
- Come. Come.
- Wait!

1098
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:58,561
- Where you are going?
- Come on. Help me.

1099
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:12,279
(Squeaking)

1100
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,287
(Loud animal noises)

1101
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:28,180
(Woman) Yeah, it's just
about half a mile down the road.

1102
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:31,748
Bye. Good luck.

1103
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:40,390
I think this is the one.

1104
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:49,439
I can't breathe.

1105
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:51,444
Look.

1106
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:55,840
(Paulie) It's her. Misha, it's her.

1107
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:57,885
(Misha) Now I can't breathe.

1108
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:02,579
(Paulie) Marie? Marie?

1109
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:08,184
- No, no, no. Please, please, wait.
- It's not her.

1110
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:10,992
- Not?
- It's not Marie.

1111
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:12,999
(Door closes)

1112
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,262
(Sighs)

1113
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:21,431
- Maybe it's wrong house.
- It's always the wrong house.

1114
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:23,476
Paulie?

1115
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:29,315
Paulie, is that really you?

1116
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,219
It's me, Paulie. It's Marie.

1117
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,347
No.

1118
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:41,628
Paulie, don't be afraid.

1119
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:45,097
I just grew up, that's all.

1120
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,260
Go away. Leave me alone.

1121
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:50,932
Paulie?

1122
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,031
I'm sorry. We are in shock.

1123
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:01,840
- Paulie, come back here.
- It's not Marie. It's not her.

1124
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:11,786
(Marie) # You're the song
that the tree sings

1125
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:16,296
# When the wind blows

1126
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:19,265
# You're a flower

1127
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,597
# You're a river

1128
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,194
# You're a rainbow... #

1129
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,206
Marie?

1130
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:32,977
# I loved you the first time

1131
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:37,313
# I saw you

1132
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:41,287
# And I always will love you, Marie #

1133
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:43,254
Marie!

1134
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:49,830
You got big!

1135
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:51,831
Mm-hmm.

1136
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:54,663
- You flew.
- What?

1137
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:58,064
- You flew, Paulie.
- I did?

1138
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:03,133
- Yes, you did!
- How? His wings were clipped.

1139
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:06,042
The feathers must have grown back.
They always do.

1140
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,240
No.

1141
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:09,977
- You can fly.
- No.

1142
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,985
Oh, yes, you can.

1143
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:23,261
Whoo-hoo!

1144
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,629
(Paulie laughs)

1145
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:39,073
Oh, this is my little neighbor,
Kimmy.

1146
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:42,479
Remember the parrot I told you about,
who helped me when I was little?

1147
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,484
- Uh-huh.
- He's home.

1148
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:47,783
- Can I play with him sometime?
- Yes.

1149
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,830
I can't thank you enough.

1150
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:58,990
You're welcome.

1151
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:03,332
- So, I will go now.
- Oh, no, no. Please don't rush off.

1152
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:06,771
- Won't you come inside?
- No, it's OK.

1153
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,207
Uh, you will have much to talk about.

1154
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:13,838
Uh, goodbye. Goodbye, Paulie.

1155
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:16,542
Misha, where you goin'?

1156
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:20,482
She has flowers in her hair.

1157
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:23,819
- (Sighs)
- I bet she has books on her table.

1158
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:26,052
- Paulie...
- What is he talking about?

1159
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:29,358
I'm not always sure.

1160
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:31,728
Misha, don't be afraid to speak.

1161
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:37,269
I'd love it if you stayed.

1162
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:47,348
You know, I would like that.
I would like that very much.

1163
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:52,779
Paulie, how did you find me?

1164
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:55,651
(Paulie) Well, it's a long story.

1165
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,850
- It's the only kind he knows.
- (Chuckles)
