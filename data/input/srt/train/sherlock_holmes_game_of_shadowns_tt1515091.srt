When did you start working
for the postal service?

14
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:08,515
That was you back there?

15
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,240
It's shame your activities
have landed you in the gutter

16
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,529
a curious parcel? Who's
the intended recipient?

17
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,954
Why don't we discuss that
over dinner tonight?

18
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,073
- I'm free for lunch.
- Hmm.. I'm not

19
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:21,887
how about at savoy,
eight o'clock?

20
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:23,075
Splendid

21
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:25,108
and will you becoming
as yourself?

22
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:25,900
Most likely

23
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,643
three men have been following
you for the last half mile

24
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:32,853
their motives highly unsavoiry

25
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,056
no

26
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:48,311
oh, and by the way,
they're not pursuing me

27
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:51,396
they're escorting me, and instead
of three, there seems to be..

28
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,601
Ah.. Four

29
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,812
steady hands with that Irene

30
00:02:57,836 --> 00:03:00,359
oh, I don't think it's my
hands you've to worry about

31
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:04,218
now, be careful with the face boys,
we do have a dinner date tonight

32
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,078
don't fill up on bread

33
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:32,211
I've got the rest of it

34
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,383
uhh, it's coming back now

35
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:08,722
hey, youths!

36
00:05:16,337 --> 00:05:20,158
<i>Now comes to lot 34.</i>

37
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:25,562
<i>Egyptian sarcophagus of
outstanding Providence</i>

38
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,701
<i>retrieved from the
valley of the kings</i>

39
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,454
your payment, doctor..
He sends his thanks

40
00:05:30,604 --> 00:05:33,246
who will bid, one
hundred pounds?

41
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:36,376
One hundred pounds!

42
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:40,206
Please give this to
him, he's expecting it

43
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:44,356
tell him our friend thinks I
delivered it to his sister

44
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:51,754
ah, stay

45
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:53,966
while I check the contents.

46
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,637
- I was assured full payment would be there.
- Yes

47
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,511
but assured by whom? Have
you ever met him in person?

48
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,282
All likely...

49
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,071
Hold it, hold it, hold it...
Don't move it!

50
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:12,935
Judging from its size and weight,
it's not payment you were expecting

51
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,876
I'd wager the contents are
rather more incendiary

52
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:17,860
- who is this?
- It's..

53
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,775
Hello, darling.

54
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,368
Oh dear... I told
you not to move it

55
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:29,172
it seems a secondary
charge has been activated

56
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,075
sweet thing, I might need your help
in the disposal of this parcel

57
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:35,589
1600, 1700..

58
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:37,997
- 1800..
- Well, good luck!

59
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:40,213
One million pounds!

60
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:45,811
Oh... and uhm... by the way, fire..
Fire!

61
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,968
Leave my side and you'll
be dead within an hour

62
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,219
and don't be late for dinner

63
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:58,942
I expect that my schedule be quite tight
because of these activities here.

64
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:01,776
- I'm never late in my life, only early.
- Passionately

65
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:07,351
hmm... hmm... very witty, so
confident even in retreat

66
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:10,785
I'll hold on to that.. We'll
read it together during aperitif

67
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:11,842
all right..

68
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:14,328
Dinner and a show

69
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,957
stay! Trust me.. This is
what I do for a living

70
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,443
hey hoffmanstahl, you
should count yourself lucky

71
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:29,032
this faceless man with whom
you find yourself in business

72
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,337
is no ordinary criminal

73
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:33,302
he's the Napoleon of
crime, fortunately..

74
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,652
You now have me as an ally

75
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,437
I'm a consulting detective
of some repute...

76
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,166
Perhaps you've heard of me..
My name is Sherlock hol..

77
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,325
Holmes..

78
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:33,149
Ah.. Fresh pot of tea,
thank you, George

79
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,562
yes, miss adler

80
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:39,257
fine choice, this place

81
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:42,902
do you have the letter?

82
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:44,557
It was taken

83
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:49,382
taken? Now that is unfortunate

84
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,857
during the chaos created
by your package

85
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:02,556
perhaps if you had
shared your plans

86
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:06,149
you wish to know my
plans now, do you?

87
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,854
Did you imagine miss adler, that
something would happen to you?

88
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:12,982
Is that why you chose to meet
here, in a public place?

89
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:15,436
Your favorite restaurant

90
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:48,518
I don't blame you

91
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,498
I blame myself

92
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:58,430
it's been apparent me for some time that
you had succumbed to your feeling for him

93
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:03,370
and this isn't the first occasion
mister Holmes has inconvenienced me

94
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,353
in recent months

95
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:08,373
the question is

96
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:12,124
what to do about it?

97
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:18,271
But

98
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,920
that's my problem to solve now

99
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,548
I no longer require
your services.

100
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,523
Mrs. Hudson?

101
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:03,068
Ooh, Mrs. Hudson?

102
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,509
Holmes, you in there?

103
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:17,430
Your hedge needs trimming..

104
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:23,408
<i>Where am I?</i>

105
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:26,708
Okay, where you are,
as long as you ready.

106
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:31,708
<i>I'm waiting..</i>

107
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,708
I'm not going to play this game

108
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,812
remember I have to
catch the last..

109
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:47,651
Train

110
00:12:47,758 --> 00:12:50,583
- o oh..That's you there, I'm afraid..
- You win

111
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:57,288
I lose.. Game over

112
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:01,172
still don't see me?

113
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,792
<i>(French) What a surprise</i>

114
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:12,497
I'm not going out with
you dressed like that.

115
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:18,177
Would you prefer I joined you in the fashion
folk pathway and fine military dress...

116
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:23,572
With that hedonist hand-made scarf..
Clearly, one of your fiancé's early efforts?

117
00:13:23,932 --> 00:13:26,917
- Oh... how I've missed you, Holmes.
- Have you?

118
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,871
Why?

119
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:32,386
I've barely of noticed your absence..
Then again I'm knee deep in research

120
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:35,687
extracting fluids from the
adrenal glands of sheep

121
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:38,563
and designing my own
urban camouflage

122
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:43,719
all the while verging on a decisive breakthrough,
in the single most important case of my career

123
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:47,000
perhaps of all time.

124
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:49,241
Mrs. Hudson, how are you?

125
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:53,123
Ohh.. I'm so pleased to see you, doctor..
Thank you for inviting me tomorrow

126
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:55,556
and thank you for
looking after gladstone

127
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:59,805
dear... dear sickly sweet nanny

128
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:02,294
might I have a word?

129
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,023
Yummy..

130
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:06,202
Feed the snake, woman

131
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:08,407
you feed it!

132
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:12,112
Touchy touchy.

133
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,566
Doctor, you must get
him to a sanatorium

134
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,604
he's been on a diet of coffee,
tobacco, and cocoa leaves

135
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:20,987
he never sleeps

136
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:24,537
I hear multiple voices, as
if he's rehearsing a play

137
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:27,014
leave him to me

138
00:14:27,124 --> 00:14:30,085
don't you have a goat
that needs worming?

139
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,466
Oh, how kind of you to remind me

140
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:36,812
so much to look forward to..
What would I do without you?

141
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:39,968
Good luck on patient, doctor

142
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,661
why are you here?

143
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:45,915
I'm getting married, tomorrow?

144
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,928
Oh, embrace me!

145
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:51,272
Watson's getting married

146
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:54,902
- you lost a few pounds.
- Less than you picked them up

147
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:58,036
nurturing on Mary's
muffins no doubt

148
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,059
pour us a Brandy..
Stag party has begun

149
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,782
it's our last adventure Watson

150
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:08,915
I intend to make the most of it

151
00:15:19,455 --> 00:15:21,806
I see you've made good
use of my old office

152
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:25,029
- do you like my spider's web?
- Is that what you call it?

153
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:27,303
Follow that strand

154
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,124
question..

155
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:32,406
What do a scandal involving
an Indian cotton tycoon,

156
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:34,582
the overdose of a
Chinese opium trader..

157
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:36,510
Bombings in strasbourg
and vienna,

158
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:41,404
and the death of a steel magnate
in America, all have in common?

159
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:45,422
Well, according to your diorama

160
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,202
Professor James moriarty

161
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:49,988
indeed

162
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:52,142
mathematical genius

163
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,595
celebrated author and lecturer

164
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:56,140
boxing champion at Cambridge,

165
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,911
where he'd made friends with
our current prime minister

166
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:02,987
do you have any evidence to
substantiate your claim?

167
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,342
Hmm.. This..

168
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,256
Now do you see?

169
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:11,493
Doctor hoffmanstahl's death?

170
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,826
Yes, I've heard you speak of
him extolling his virtues

171
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:19,124
oh, hoffmanstahl was at the forefront
of medical innovations, a true pioneer

172
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:24,027
just the other day, I averted an
explosion that was intended for him

173
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,333
it says here, he
died of heart attack

174
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,590
has all my instruction
been for naught?

175
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,780
You still read the offical
statement and believe it?

176
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:34,917
It's a game dear man, a shadowy game..
We're playing cat and mouse,

177
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,829
the Professor and I..
Cloak and dagger..

178
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:40,542
I thought it was spider and fly

179
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:42,811
I'm not a fly, I'm a cat

180
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:45,210
not a mouse, but a dagger

181
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:47,584
you're drinking embalming fluid

182
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:50,776
oh yes.. Care for a drop?

183
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,625
- You do seem..
- Excited?

184
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:53,999
- Manic.
- I am!

185
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:55,230
- Verging on..
- Ecstatic?

186
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Psychotic.

187
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:00,866
- I should've brought you a sedative.
- I'll give my life to see his demise

188
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:05,245
he must be stopped.. Before his evil
machinations come to a crescendo

189
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:06,882
and how will you do all that?

190
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:10,874
Don't be a dingy bird, bad people
do bad things because they can

191
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:14,833
no one.. Not the victims, the police,
the governments, not anyone!

192
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,873
- Except the great Sherlock Holmes.
- Correct

193
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:19,772
on this diet, will
work it all out

194
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:20,543
right

195
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,540
- or thereabouts.
- Thereabouts - not quite that

196
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,949
here's to your good health

197
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:29,092
dingy bird!

198
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:34,753
What you did to gladstone now?!

199
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,825
<i>Ricinus communis the
fruit is highly toxic</i>

200
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:41,015
he's barely breathing!

201
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:45,178
It was an excellent opportunity..
This may be just the thing

202
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:49,498
I hope you don't mind terribly
if I tried my adrenal extract

203
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:52,724
how many times are you going
to kill my dog, Holmes?

204
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,642
He took off like a
monkey from a box!

205
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,075
- I may need one of those in a few hours.
- Consider it a wedding gift

206
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,403
Watson, might we use
an alternative exit?

207
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:11,498
- Is there something different about you?
- I'm under observation

208
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:15,535
- as you should be.
- You drive

209
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:22,240
will your beard, be
with us all night?

210
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:25,798
I'll remove it once we're
South of trafalgar square

211
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:30,345
if you believe moriarty has
you under observation,

212
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:32,440
isn't this a bit conspicuous?

213
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,122
It's so overt, it's covert.

214
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:40,734
Trafalgar square

215
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:43,059
we must be safe by now

216
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:52,733
why are you looking at
me with such concern?

217
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,288
I'm so very worried

218
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:57,182
your vitality's been
drained from you

219
00:18:57,605 --> 00:19:01,103
- marriage it's the end, I tell you.
- I think of it as the beginning

220
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,761
- armageddon!
- Rebirth!

221
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,265
- Restriction!
- Structure!

222
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:07,473
- Answering to a woman?
- Being in a relationship

223
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:10,983
a life in matrimony, the
possibility of a family,

224
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,402
who wants to die alone?

225
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:19,044
So, we'll have a good old fashioned romp tonight,
you'll settle down have a family.. And I'll...

226
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,283
Die alone..

227
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,094
Yes that's about it

228
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:30,522
perhaps it's better for one to die alone than to..
Live life in eternal purgatory

229
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:34,922
anyway

230
00:19:39,735 --> 00:19:41,465
not bad, that

231
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:44,031
so, where are we going?

232
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:47,664
<i>(Mycroft) In the future, there will be one
of those machines in every town in Europe</i>

233
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,701
loitering in the
woodshed again..

234
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:51,742
- Are we, my king?
- Good evening, Shirley

235
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:55,297
I see your boot maker
is ill, dear brother

236
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:59,777
as I detect that you've recently changed
the brand of soap, with which you shave..

237
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:04,655
May I point out the chimney in the front room of Baker
street, is to the need of a damn good sweeping out..

238
00:20:04,677 --> 00:20:08,135
Are you aware that the hackney carriage by
which you arrived, had a damaged wheel?

239
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,557
Yes, the left

240
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:14,969
and it's plain to the meanest intelligence that
you've recently acquired a new bow for your violin

241
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:16,824
same bow, new strings

242
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:19,233
and may I deduce, mycroft..

243
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:21,627
- Good evening, by the way.
- No!

244
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,191
He doesn't

245
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:27,086
may I deduce, that you who
rarely strays from the path..

246
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:29,912
Runs from your home to
the diogenes club..

247
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:34,117
And never on a Monday.. When they
serve your favorite potted shrimps..

248
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:38,728
Must be here for some far more
important reason than my stag party

249
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:44,699
<i>you know, he's nothing like as slow-witted as
you've been leading me to believe, Shirley</i>

250
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:46,537
you're quite right,
doctor Watson

251
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:49,568
but with all the conflict
in Europe at the moment..

252
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,483
The whole situation could..

253
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:54,509
Excuse me, suddenly erupt..

254
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,318
I'm here, to avoid
a dire catastrophe

255
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:02,579
if the concerns of two nations

256
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:04,851
which shall remain nameless..

257
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:08,911
But I can tell you they
speak French and German

258
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:13,018
are not dealt with tonight I shall
be forced to go to Switzerland

259
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:16,550
to attend a ghastly peace
summit in richtenburg

260
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,092
<i>first thing about the Switzerland
is the altitude...(Fading)</i>

261
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:25,315
<i>I'm so glad you invited
your brother..(Sarcasm)</i>

262
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:43,499
- This looks promising.
- And your poison of choice gentlemen?

263
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:46,759
We'll start with the champagne,
we may need several more chairs

264
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:48,694
perhaps a good cigar

265
00:21:49,872 --> 00:21:53,088
and uhm.. Don't bother
with the chairs

266
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:58,158
what is it your brother does exactly?
- He is the keeper of the broom covet of state,

267
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:01,767
no ambition, no energy
and I'm repeatedly told,

268
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:03,992
that he's indispensable
to the British government

269
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,645
particularly the foreign office..
I would like to propose a toast

270
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:08,828
really?

271
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:12,765
To my dear friend, doctor John..

272
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:16,783
Ummm... Hamish.. Watson..

273
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:21,316
- I'm right here.
- On the Eve of his wedding, he...

274
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:26,120
- Has been the best of companions.
- Shouldn't we be waiting?

275
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:29,308
- For the boys from my rugby club?
- He's always kept us

276
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:33,475
- they could've attend flat footed on the ground.
- All of them?

277
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:36,447
- Hmmm.. What about the chaps from my medical school?
- I attempted they declined

278
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,313
- the lads from.
- There's no man better

279
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:41,268
- who is it your looking for?
- Worth having at your side.

280
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:44,818
- I don't know a single damn person here, do I?
- There's no need for hysterics

281
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,771
you know me, and
you know mycroft..

282
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,288
Don't be a pounce, Watson

283
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:50,913
pounce?!

284
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:54,746
You completely forgot about
my stag party, didn't you?

285
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:58,935
- Why are we here?
- Your in very good health doctor

286
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,388
shame none of your
friends could make it

287
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:10,180
I'm going to the gaming tables

288
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,311
I refuse for this night to be a
total loss, give me my money!

289
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:15,795
Happily... give me
the wedding ring!

290
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:18,703
Oh... now you are interested
in being the best man

291
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:20,987
you're suppose to
keep the ring anyway

292
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:23,544
just as you're supposed
to organize my stag party

293
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,160
you don't want to lose
it on a bet John...

294
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:28,490
And invite my friends, which
by the way, there are many

295
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,336
you're the one with no friends,

296
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:33,173
surely no mates..

297
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:40,058
He's all me, me, me, isn't he?

298
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:04,298
Please sit

299
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:07,542
put your money on the
table and we will begin

300
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:16,560
welcome, I'm madame simza

301
00:24:20,396 --> 00:24:24,081
cards can illuminate your past

302
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:28,682
clarify your present,
and show you the future

303
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:34,522
if you have a specific
question, hold it in your mind

304
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:47,804
- hold it.
- Let me know when your ready

305
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:51,875
actually, I prefer to read..
Your fortune

306
00:24:55,988 --> 00:24:57,599
temperance

307
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,285
inverted..

308
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,608
Indicative of volatility

309
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:04,816
a woman who recently
taken a confident drink

310
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:09,250
from what does she seek solace?
What does she wish not to see?

311
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:12,805
Ah, a fool embarrassing himself?

312
00:25:13,674 --> 00:25:15,904
Oh, yes the fool

313
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:20,216
someone had been led astray, involved
in something without their knowledge

314
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,943
not bad, but um.. You have
to make me believe you..

315
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:26,072
I have to see it in your eyes

316
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,659
I can do better

317
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:33,599
the two of cups, a powerful bond..
But between whom?

318
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,128
A brother and a sister perhaps?

319
00:25:36,642 --> 00:25:39,598
And I see a name.. Yes it's..

320
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:41,962
Rene

321
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:44,986
what do you want?

322
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:47,591
The devil

323
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:54,151
why are we playing this game?

324
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,415
- Where did you get this?
- I stole it from a woman in an auction room

325
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:09,308
but I believe it was
intended for you.

326
00:26:14,643 --> 00:26:18,328
<i>SIM my love, remember my face
as you never see it again..</i>

327
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:22,316
<i>That is the price I must pay, to
change the course of history..</i>

328
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,469
I have finally found
my purpose in life

329
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:30,092
so the question I've been holding is,
what purpose is rene fulfilling?

330
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:35,813
Time is up

331
00:26:35,938 --> 00:26:38,265
I have other clients

332
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:46,785
<i>though you may not have detected
the wisp of astrakhan fur</i>

333
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:48,435
snagged on a nail
from my left shoulder

334
00:26:48,555 --> 00:26:53,300
you couldn't have failed to notice the
overpowering aroma of herring pickled in vodka

335
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:56,743
in tandem with a truly
unfortunate body odour

336
00:26:56,913 --> 00:27:00,302
there's a man concealed
in the rafters above us

337
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:03,841
a cossack, renowned for the
invisible acrobatic abilities..

338
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:07,567
And are notorious for their
hunting, as assassins

339
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:12,063
so it's safe to presume that your
next client, is here to kill you

340
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:14,836
anything else? No?

341
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,701
First, pillage the nest

342
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,815
clip wings

343
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:32,952
now blunt his beak

344
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:39,758
crack eggs

345
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,856
scramble pinch of salt

346
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,442
touch of pepper

347
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:55,526
flip the omelette

348
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,053
additional seasoning required

349
00:28:03,776 --> 00:28:06,663
breakfast is served

350
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:22,742
come with me I need
you alive, now!

351
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:36,755
Didn't see that in
the cards, did you?

352
00:29:56,555 --> 00:29:58,463
Carry down folks, carry down..

353
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:02,997
Looks like we get ourselves
our next cock fight

354
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:09,692
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.. Let him go!

355
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:37,263
Get after him!

356
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:48,303
All mine?

357
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:14,486
Now, wait a minute

358
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:53,070
<i>- you're right, it is sting.
- Hey, you you run, where, where's you...?</i>

359
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:57,755
Just had a fight!

360
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,708
- You just had a fight?
- Yes

361
00:32:01,714 --> 00:32:02,737
where were you?

362
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:06,459
I am glad to see you're taking your
best man duty so seriously, Sherlock

363
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:09,574
I was on my own.. You're
not gonna get my moneys!

364
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:11,766
She was biting my leg

365
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:17,018
I'll have carruthers put some fuel into that motor
carriage of yours.. You do have a wedding to attend..

366
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:19,708
Oh, I'll drive..

367
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:28,407
- Another drink?
- I don't know, I think you've had quite enough

368
00:34:57,832 --> 00:35:00,134
I've been to a
wedding here before

369
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,322
a funeral too

370
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:10,360
the Professor wants to meet

371
00:35:11,032 --> 00:35:13,482
I'd expected to hear
from him sooner..

372
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:18,930
In light of recent events - and he was wondering if it
would be convenient for you to come by the college ..

373
00:35:18,954 --> 00:35:23,008
This afternoon.. His lecture
concludes at four..

374
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:25,039
Looking forward..

375
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:28,497
One side chumney.

376
00:35:52,229 --> 00:35:56,463
Fischerweise... schubert, 1826

377
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,524
<i>(speaking German)</i>

378
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:07,277
- Give up your foolish trickery.
- This fish you can not cheat..

379
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,606
I hope I'm not intruding

380
00:36:11,492 --> 00:36:13,835
ahh, excuse me.. Please take
these up to Mr. Williams

381
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:16,440
and make sure he packs
my white tie and tails..

382
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:17,980
I'll take care of it Professor

383
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:21,706
I do apologize, I'm off
on a blasted lecture tour

384
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:24,433
- would you care for some tea or coffee?
- Neither..

385
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,926
- Something stronger perhaps?
- No, but...

386
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:30,291
Might I trouble you
for an inscription?

387
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:34,785
<i><font color="#00ffff">The dynamics of an asteroid & lecture
notes by Professor James moriarty</font></i>

388
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:51,269
I read that the good doctor
was to be married today

389
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:54,313
- how was the service?
- Definitive

390
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:58,316
he'll no longer be party to my investigations,
he's out of the equation, I..

391
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:03,067
Trust you'll take this
into consideration?

392
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:09,745
<i><font color="#00ffff">The art of domestic holticulture</font> and
what considerations will you grant me?</i>

393
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:22,248
- Have you actually read the book?
- I found it compelling

394
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:26,890
though, I'm primarily intrested
in your more recent, endeavors

395
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:29,901
I take that as a compliment

396
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:33,581
I have the utmost
regard for your times

397
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,182
it's a pleasure..
To finally meet you

398
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,333
officially

399
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,772
are you familiar with the
study of graphology?

400
00:37:46,957 --> 00:37:49,698
I've never given it any
serious thought, no

401
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:52,563
psychological analysis
of handwriting

402
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:55,625
<i>the upward strokes on the p,
the j, and the m, indicate..</i>

403
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:58,215
A genius level of intellect

404
00:37:58,357 --> 00:38:02,967
while the flourishes on the lower zone, denote
a highly creative yet meticulous nature

405
00:38:03,578 --> 00:38:07,084
but, if one observes the overall
slant, and the pressure of the writing

406
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:09,944
there's a suggestion
of acute narcissism,

407
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,651
a complete lack of empathy, and a
pronounced inclination toward..

408
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:16,774
- No!
- Moral insanity

409
00:38:17,313 --> 00:38:22,287
an answer to your previous request, regarding
doctor Watson, not being involved..

410
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:26,128
The answer is.. No

411
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:31,487
the laws of celestrial mechanics
dictate that when two objects collide

412
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:37,705
there is always damage
of a collateral nature

413
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,996
<i>(speaks Latin) For example..</i>

414
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:45,600
Two gentlemen, find themselves
at cross of purposes

415
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:50,485
a young woman torn between them

416
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:53,522
the strain proves
too much for her

417
00:38:53,682 --> 00:38:56,484
and she suddenly falls ill

418
00:38:56,494 --> 00:39:00,823
with.. Tragic consequences

419
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:06,138
a rare form of tuberculosis

420
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:09,580
she succumbed in a
matter of seconds

421
00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:14,926
now

422
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:20,022
are you sure you want
to play this game?

423
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,586
I'm afraid you'd lose

424
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:26,769
rest assured

425
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:30,167
if you attempt to bring
destruction down upon me

426
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:33,399
I shall do the same to you

427
00:39:33,544 --> 00:39:35,690
my respect for you, Mr. Holmes..

428
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:39,495
Is the only reason
you're still alive

429
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:44,769
you've paid me several compliments..
Let me pay you one in return..

430
00:39:45,006 --> 00:39:49,240
When I said if I were assured
of the former eventuality

431
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:54,043
I will cheerfully
accept the latter

432
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:01,703
I'll be sure to send my
regards to the happy couple

433
00:40:05,063 --> 00:40:07,276
another time then..

434
00:40:28,532 --> 00:40:29,895
All aboard!

435
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:33,724
- Which cart are we?
- We should be just... here

436
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:38,169
first class!

437
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:41,764
All aboard! All aboard!

438
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,940
Hurry up doctor Watson,
your wife needs you

439
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:49,012
coming Mrs. Watson

440
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:56,725
first class champagne.. You do know
how to spoil a girl, Mr. Watson

441
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:59,362
you're not just any girl

442
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:03,636
I'm sorry madam, but you can't use the
lavatory while the train's in station

443
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:10,024
you're Mrs. Watson

444
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:13,072
give me that bottle

445
00:41:27,414 --> 00:41:30,085
John, there is no where else
in the world I'd rather be

446
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,874
there's no one I'd
rather be with

447
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:36,660
why do you have a gun stuffed
down the back of your trousers?

448
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,093
Old habits

449
00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:44,554
come in!

450
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:49,098
- Oh yes, please.
- We didn't order that

451
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:53,288
- with our compliments, sir.
- Thank you, put it there

452
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,488
open the door, John!

453
00:42:12,724 --> 00:42:15,646
I think it's time
for you to leave

454
00:42:21,357 --> 00:42:22,986
sit down

455
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:50,915
I agree it's not my best
disguise, but I had to make do

456
00:42:52,643 --> 00:42:55,227
- my God!
- They'll be back

457
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,411
- ohh.. John, shut the door!
- They'll only shoot through it my lovey

458
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:59,808
- he's right.
- Oh my God!

459
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,272
- I understand.
- Do you?

460
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:05,576
Terribly inconvenient

461
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,682
we don't have much time!

462
00:43:14,332 --> 00:43:17,212
- How many are we expecting?
- Half a dozen - who are they?

463
00:43:17,372 --> 00:43:19,722
A wedding present from moriarty

464
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:22,625
lovely ceremony by the way,
many a tears shed in joy

465
00:43:22,781 --> 00:43:24,316
oh John!

466
00:43:24,418 --> 00:43:27,158
- Just a minute, darling.
- Do you trust me?

467
00:43:27,502 --> 00:43:28,499
No

468
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:30,568
well, then I should have to

469
00:43:30,844 --> 00:43:33,079
do something about that

470
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:35,271
no...!!

471
00:43:39,078 --> 00:43:41,831
Who's up to bat
next you bastards!

472
00:43:41,972 --> 00:43:44,355
Send out the fastballer!

473
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,285
John, do shut the door!

474
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:53,683
It had to be done

475
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:56,125
she's safe now!

476
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:01,227
In my own defense, I
timed it perfectly

477
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:03,626
did you killed my wife?!

478
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:07,454
Did you just kill my new wife?!

479
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:08,904
Of course not!

480
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,789
What do you mean?

481
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:14,784
How do you know that.. When you
just threw her off the train?!

482
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:17,162
I told you I'd
timed it perfectly

483
00:44:17,295 --> 00:44:20,000
what does that mean?

484
00:44:22,887 --> 00:44:24,809
- Calm down!
- Explain!!

485
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,602
By the time I'd explain
we'd both be dead!

486
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,155
I'm sorry madam but you can't use the
lavatory while the train's in station

487
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:07,155
<i><font color="#00ffff">caution! Phosphorus
highly flammable </font></i>

488
00:45:36,338 --> 00:45:38,404
that was no accident

489
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:41,112
it was by design

490
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:47,838
now, do you need
me to elaborate?

491
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:52,468
Or can we just crack on?

492
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,998
Come on!

493
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,934
Don't worry old boy, she's as safe
as houses, she's with my brother

494
00:46:09,044 --> 00:46:11,651
I'm on my honeymoon!

495
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,877
Why did you lead them here?

496
00:46:13,995 --> 00:46:16,003
- Why did you involve us?
- There not here for me

497
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,248
there here for you!

498
00:46:23,504 --> 00:46:25,432
Fortunately

499
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:34,037
so am I

500
00:46:34,153 --> 00:46:35,948
now mind the door!

501
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:37,906
Good evening

502
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:43,723
I think you'll find second
class is more comfortable,

503
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:45,803
the coast is clear

504
00:46:46,088 --> 00:46:48,643
to the South! Quick march!

505
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:58,880
- Lie down with me, Watson!
- Why?!

506
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:01,352
I insist

507
00:47:07,398 --> 00:47:12,501
- what are we doing down here?
- We are waiting, I am smoking

508
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:35,039
- patiently waiting.
- For what?!

509
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,274
Your window of opportunity

510
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:47,407
make it count!

511
00:47:55,012 --> 00:47:56,412
I said make it count!

512
00:47:56,955 --> 00:47:59,557
How many windows must I provide?

513
00:48:20,328 --> 00:48:23,531
Who'd have known that honeymooning in
Brighton was such a dangerous notion?

514
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:24,949
Is that all this is about?

515
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:27,670
By your own admission,
you've never enjoy it there

516
00:48:27,997 --> 00:48:29,998
I've never been to Brighton

517
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:33,816
or... your just too fragile
to remember at present

518
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:36,663
tell me that my wife's safe!

519
00:48:36,993 --> 00:48:37,993
I can't do both

520
00:48:38,526 --> 00:48:39,527
I promise

521
00:48:39,804 --> 00:48:41,590
as I said, I timed it perfectly

522
00:48:49,374 --> 00:48:50,875
over here, madam!

523
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:55,987
I believe congratulations
are in order Mrs. Watson

524
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:00,416
I'm the other Holmes

525
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:04,253
you mean there's two of you?

526
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,912
Oh how marvelous, could this
evening get any better?

527
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:09,582
Why were Mary and I
targeted at all?

528
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:10,552
Excellent question

529
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:13,341
the answer is two fold

530
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:14,089
he's after us

531
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:15,390
because of you!

532
00:49:15,408 --> 00:49:17,909
I'm afraid you must bear
half the responsibility

533
00:49:17,952 --> 00:49:19,353
here it comes..

534
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:22,145
Had you and Mary had not been
so hellbent on your wedding,

535
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:23,706
we could've already
solved this case

536
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,780
<font color="#ffff01">there it is..
It's my fault now</font>

537
00:49:24,156 --> 00:49:26,656
all I'm saying is that
the argument could mean

538
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,661
<font color="#ffff01">no, it couldn't</font>

539
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:29,266
that your nuptials were
rather poorly timed

540
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:31,536
thus

541
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:33,716
our relationship

542
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:35,345
relationship?

543
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:37,644
Very well, partnership

544
00:49:38,618 --> 00:49:41,254
has not yet run it's course

545
00:49:41,755 --> 00:49:44,800
my dear fellow if you could be bothered
to see this through to the end,

546
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:48,094
I shall never again
ask you to assist me

547
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:56,194
once more until the bridge

548
00:49:56,803 --> 00:49:57,994
that's the spirit!

549
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,188
Now to the question,

550
00:49:59,378 --> 00:50:00,879
this is so deliciously
complicated

551
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,058
you may be asking yourself

552
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:06,359
what does a crimial mastermind want
with a simple gypsy fortune teller?

553
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:07,859
It's about her
brother, I tell you

554
00:50:08,182 --> 00:50:09,883
when we find him and we must

555
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,462
after you find my luggage

556
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,911
go on

557
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:16,088
wait

558
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:18,307
where is it were going?

559
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:22,503
Paris, the most sensible
honeymoon destination of all..

560
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:47,501
So, why Paris?

561
00:50:47,768 --> 00:50:48,669
Peaches

562
00:50:49,155 --> 00:50:50,795
outside the city of montroy..

563
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:54,654
There's a gypsy camp famous
for it's dried fruit,

564
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:55,948
especially peaches

565
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,345
and there we shall find

566
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,700
our fortune teller..

567
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:02,445
And return her bag

568
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:07,026
<i>(speaks French)</i>

569
00:52:07,183 --> 00:52:08,184
<i>(Speaks French)</i>

570
00:52:19,825 --> 00:52:21,496
My ticket?

571
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,800
<i>(Speaks French)</i>

572
00:52:33,962 --> 00:52:36,663
Unfortunately you won't
be needing yours

573
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:39,360
it's a shame Professor

574
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:42,902
I was looking forward
to don Giovanni

575
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,300
<i>(speaks French) Thank
you/ thank you</i>

576
00:52:52,376 --> 00:52:54,677
follow meinhard!

577
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,800
<i>(Speaks French)
Stop, thank you</i>

578
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:35,430
wake up, we're here

579
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:38,198
brace yourself, were
about to be violated

580
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:40,087
don't be so cynical

581
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:41,491
<i>(speaks French)
Good afternoon..</i>

582
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:43,494
<i>(Speaks French) Madam simza?</i>

583
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,821
<i>(Speaks French) Yes, yes, sir</i>

584
00:53:47,419 --> 00:53:48,974
perfect

585
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,295
they're taking my luggage..

586
00:53:50,296 --> 00:53:52,623
Laugh them away Watson,
I have her bag

587
00:53:52,624 --> 00:53:55,169
<i>(speaks French)
This is her bag</i>

588
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,160
you had her bag

589
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,240
now they have my coat

590
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,760
where is madam simza?

591
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,920
This is simza.

592
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,920
SIM is a goose

593
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,960
I am SIM

594
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,240
nice scarf.. I like

595
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,800
- you hungry?
- Famished.

596
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,360
Madam, this is a glorious
hedgehog goulash

597
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,120
I can't remember ever
having had better

598
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,320
do tell me, when was the last
time you had a hedgehog goulash?

599
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,080
I told you, Watson,
I can't remember

600
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,000
perhaps you've repressed it

601
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,800
that's where we differ,
unlike you, I repress nothing

602
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,520
perfectly normal

603
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,560
how dare you be rude to this woman
who has invited us into her tent

604
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,320
offered us her hedgehog?

605
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,200
Says the man who throws
women from trains

606
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,280
who are you two?

607
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,160
Concerned citizens

608
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,040
why did someone try to kill me?

609
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,600
Your brother has become involved
with a very dangerous man

610
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,440
who clearly believes that rene has
told you something you shouldn't know

611
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,720
I don't know anything

612
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,680
I've been looking for
him for over a year

613
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,960
that was why I was in London

614
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,720
- it's the last place anyone saw him.
- It's clear that your brother loves you

615
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,840
he'd never send you a message
that would put you in harm's way

616
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,720
any information, therefore, would
be, by default, unintentional

617
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,960
has he sent you anything else?

618
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,400
Just a few drawings

619
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,000
let's just see what
they have to tell us

620
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,200
unusual choice of paper, thicker
gauge, designed for a printing press

621
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,400
- and it's the same stock as the letter.
- Hmm..

622
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,480
They smell musty

623
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,240
must have been stored
somewhere cold and damp

624
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,920
what's that? Blood?

625
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,080
Wine.. So, a wine cellar located
near a printing press..

626
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,720
That should narrow it down

627
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,240
<i>there's a wine cellar used by
the anarchist group lapin vert.</i>

628
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,760
Rene was close to their leader

629
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,360
Claude ravache

630
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,040
- a bomb maker.
- I sampled some of his work last week

631
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,280
I was a part of the
movement, so was rene

632
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,960
until it became too
extreme for us.

633
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,320
Ravache knows me

634
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:19,040
if my brother's back
there, he will see us

635
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,280
go send him a message

636
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,400
whatever you do, don't let
these gypsies make you drink

637
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,600
of course

638
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,480
you dance?

639
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,320
For God's sake, don't dance!
It'll be the death of you

640
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,280
you know what happens
when you dance

641
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,080
oh, good morning, Mrs. Watson

642
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,740
- have you had breakfast?
- I...

643
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,740
<i>Stanley here does a
wonderful deviled kidney.</i>

644
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,600
- Carruthers?
- Morning, sir

645
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,160
telegram for Mrs. Watson

646
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,800
uh..

647
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,680
It just doesn't make any sense

648
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,200
allow me

649
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,040
oh, yes

650
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,560
<i>my most loathed Mary, I do not love
you, I never wish to see you again</i>

651
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,840
<i>..every moment I count away
from you is a blessing</i>

652
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,600
fret not, it's a double
encryption, my dear

653
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,960
that sherly and I have
used since we were boys

654
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,080
if the first letter of the
message is a consonant

655
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,280
then what follows is
the mirrored truth.

656
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,720
- I see.
- Hmm..

657
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,200
Stanley!

658
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,860
You know, although our time together
has been but a brief interlude

659
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,260
I'm beginning to understand how
a man of particular disposition

660
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,840
under certain circumstances,
extreme ones perhaps

661
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,240
might grow to enjoy
the company of

662
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,400
- a person of your gender..
- Hmm

663
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,400
thank you so much

664
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,760
most charming

665
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,480
may? Terribly sorry, thank you

666
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,200
where are you going, Stanley?

667
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,280
Still hiding in basements?

668
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,480
I'm not here to see you

669
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,720
yeah

670
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,120
with your English friends

671
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,320
1189, a seminal vintage

672
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,520
the year of our
glorious revolution

673
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,700
- is he here?
- When freedom triumphed over tyranny

674
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,520
is my brother here?

675
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,000
I haven't seen him
for a long time

676
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,200
you're lying

677
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,660
sit, please..

678
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,440
A letter was received from
rene using this same paper

679
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,340
of course, he took it
with him wherever he went

680
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,080
he's telling the truth..
Rene isn't here

681
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,960
- he was given another assignment...
- By an anonymous benefactor

682
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,040
another englishman

683
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,440
with money, power, who
supported our cause

684
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,640
and now

685
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,040
he dictates our every move

686
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:16,700
demanding I take responsibility
for his acts of terror

687
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,680
I made a deal with the devil

688
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,680
but after tonight

689
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,200
it will be over

690
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,920
my job is almost done

691
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,400
he's had you plant
another bomb, hasn't he?

692
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,200
Claude, please

693
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,500
these men can help you

694
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,760
I wish they could

695
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,400
you see, gentlemen

696
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,280
he has my wife and children

697
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,360
if you tell us
where the bomb is.

698
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,760
- I'll find a way to help your family.
- That's already taken care of

699
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,200
we have a deal

700
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,960
he and I

701
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,120
no loose ends

702
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,460
there's only one thing I can
do to keep my family safe

703
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,960
- you've less than 10 minutes.
- Don't!

704
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,640
He has no further need of that pistol, why
don't you take it and cover the stairs?

705
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,600
There's only one way
out of this place

706
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,280
right you are

707
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,080
ah, ingenious

708
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,860
that's the one..
Quickly as we can!

709
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,620
You know what to do with
that sandbag, Watson

710
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,600
quick now!

711
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,380
Doctor, could you
secure that leaver?

712
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,920
You could have told me.

713
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,580
Ravache was strong.. He lived for
liberty, he would never take his own life

714
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,360
calm yourself

715
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,820
my brother, he's weak.

716
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,280
SIM, I need you to
take a deep breath

717
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,640
and follow us

718
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,000
to the opera!

719
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,800
<i>News paper: <Font color="#00ffff">trade conference:
Meinhard at the hotel du triomphe</font></i>

720
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,860
<i>troller's label:
<Font color="#00ffff">hotel du triomphe</font></i>

721
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,360
I was mistaken

722
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,640
- what?
- I made a mistake

723
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,400
he took the shot from here

724
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,100
using a tripod and
a shooting stick

725
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,080
and realized there was
a better position

726
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:40,180
there's a faint scrape where he dragged
his tripod and set it up.. Here

727
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,300
- 600 yards..
- 650?

728
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,440
Not to mention.. A 7
or 8 mile an hour wind

729
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,120
he would've needed a wind gauge

730
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,480
which he placed here

731
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,580
and put a cigarette down here

732
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,920
can anyone shoot that far?

733
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,760
Not more than half a dozen
men in all of Europe

734
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,420
how many of those men
served in Afghanistan?

735
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,940
<i>- Why?
- Hirschsprung with a touch of tekel</i>

736
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:10,080
must have fallen out
when he was rolling up

737
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,080
wasn't that the blend
you all smoked?

738
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,740
- Didn't I read something about a colonel?
- Sebastian moran

739
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,600
best marksman in
the British army

740
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,760
dishonorable discharge

741
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:28,100
he's likely now a gun for hire, this is the
second victim of his, that I've encountered

742
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,980
what better way to
conceal a killing?

743
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,920
No one looks for a bullet
hole in a bomb blast

744
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,860
- he's 20 minutes late.
- He must come soon

745
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,700
I don't have any papers

746
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,960
and I am a foreigner

747
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:54,960
this climate is exactly
what moriarty wants

748
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,920
<i>the omelette
finelle was divine</i>

749
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,640
but they spared every
expense on the tea

750
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,720
now, shall we compare moods,
or consider what we know?

751
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,020
Last night's bombing
was clearly meant

752
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:12,800
to look like Germany's
retaliation for strasbourg

753
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,940
however, the bomb was also meant to
conceal the murder of just one man

754
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,820
the man killed by the gunshot was
none other than Alfred meinhard

755
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,900
he makes guns, big guns..

756
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:32,420
Only days ago, a large share of his company
was bought by an unknown investor.

757
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,240
Moriarty

758
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:38,400
the clues point in one direction, but
to avoid repeating last night's debacle

759
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:42,000
I was obliged to collect more
sufficient data, hence my tardiness

760
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,200
train departs in 40 minutes, sir

761
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,700
just the bags!

762
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:20,700
But..

763
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,320
We have enough time for me
to indulge my little habit

764
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,560
yes

765
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:29,880
his habit of feeding that urban
species, the feral pigeon

766
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,080
so there are seven mainline
railway stations in Paris

767
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,620
<i>but taking 10 minutes to get
to the jardin des tuileries</i>

768
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:41,920
where the largest concentration
of the winged vermin may be found

769
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,160
<i>reduces there to one,
the gare du nord</i>

770
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:50,480
where he will be just in time to
catch the 11:04 train to Berlin

771
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,600
it makes several stops along
the way, one of which is..

772
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,080
Heilbronn..

773
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,320
Exactly, where we must go..

774
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,280
Where meinhard's factory is

775
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,400
it's moriarty's factory now

776
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,800
unfortunately, due
to the bombing

777
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,990
the crossing between France
and Germany is to be closed

778
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,680
I'm afraid our pursuit is over,
unless we can happen upon a comrade

779
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,900
who knows their way
around borders

780
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,280
too English

781
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,960
however, you do make
a fantastic gypsy

782
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,160
certainly smell like
a fantastic gypsy

783
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,120
oh no no, I don't
mean be demeaning

784
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,440
it is a nice scarf

785
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,680
no, no, too English..
It'll suit you more

786
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,440
black one is yours,
gray one is mine

787
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,640
- and this is for you.
- Uhumm..

788
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,960
Right

789
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,440
- where are the wagons?
- The wagon is too slow

790
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,000
can't you ride?

791
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,800
It's not that he can't ride

792
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,320
how is it you put it, Holmes?

793
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,160
They're dangerous at both
ends and crafty in the middle

794
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,640
why would I want anything with a mind of
its own, bobbing about between my legs?

795
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,320
Then I shall require a
bicycle, thank you very much

796
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,990
it's 1891.. Could've
chartered a balloon

797
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,440
how can we make this
more manageable?

798
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,840
Here's the fire?

799
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,180
It's not as if Germany
is going somewhere

800
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,160
we know another way

801
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,740
slow and steady wins the race

802
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,000
come on!

803
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,990
We slip in through the loading
bay, find out what he's doing

804
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:39,560
and we get out

805
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,400
getting out might be tricky

806
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,000
we will get you out

807
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,200
if my brother's in
there, get him out alive

808
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,080
are you happy?

809
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,400
- What?
- At this moment

810
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:11,520
are you as happy as you would be
on your honeymoon in Brighton?

811
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,840
I'm not going to grace that
question with an answer

812
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,520
are you happy?
- Oh, we're here for another reason? I think we're

813
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,680
- okay.
- Shall we get on?

814
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,580
- Simple question.
- Are we gonna do something?

815
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,000
- Wait here for them to come back around?
- What time is it?

816
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,560
- 3.15
- over there

817
01:16:28,561 --> 01:16:31,880
in the residential part of the
complex should be a telegraph office

818
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,440
send this to mycroft, be
back here on the hour

819
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,040
that's what you get, Mr. Holmes,
when industry marries arms

820
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,440
now put your gun down

821
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,720
it's a bit old-fashioned

822
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,400
what you need is one of these

823
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,480
go on

824
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,840
pick one

825
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,680
machine pistol, self-repeating

826
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,840
takes 1.63 caliber rounds

827
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,520
in one of these

828
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,600
a 10-shot box magazine

829
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,200
- easy enough to load.
- Hmm..

830
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,260
I'd imagine one would have to retract
the bolt to engage the first round

831
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,180
easier done than said

832
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,140
take him to the surgery

833
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,360
I'll find the doctor

834
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,720
<i>come at once if convenient..</i>

835
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,200
<i>If inconvenient,
come all the same</i>

836
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,080
<i>it is schnapps</i>

837
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,440
a telegram was sent from here

838
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:14,680
<i>this isn't schnapps, it's aquavit,
distilled from potato mash</i>

839
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,820
a common misconception..
Thank you, by the way

840
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,080
who was it sent to?

841
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,740
My horror at your
crimes is matched only

842
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:25,820
by my admiration at the skill
it took to achieve them

843
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,640
who was it sent to?

844
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:33,900
You used the anarchists and their
bombs to create a crisis in Europe

845
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,200
nation against nation

846
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,420
under various pseudonyms, you bought,
schemed, or murdered your way

847
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,180
to numerous industries, assuring that
none of it could be traced to you

848
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:47,120
cotton, opium, steel, now
arms and chemical weaponry

849
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,520
all to be shipped across
Europe in less than a week

850
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,920
everything from
bullets to bandages

851
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,640
now that you own the supply, you
intend to create the demand

852
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,540
a world war

853
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,280
you are familiar with
schubert's work?

854
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:15,960
The trout is perhaps my favorite

855
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:22,800
a fisherman grows weary of
trying to catch an elusive fish

856
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,160
out the way, out the way!

857
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,640
So he muddies the water

858
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,800
I'm warning ya

859
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,260
confuses the fish

860
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,840
you were warned

861
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,840
it doesn't realize until too late
that it has swum into a trap

862
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,920
let's try this again, shall we?

863
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:35,040
To whom did you
send the telegram?

864
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,520
To my..

865
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,480
To my brother mycroft

866
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,220
what are you playing at?

867
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,640
That's not fair..

868
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,060
I've just got one
more question for you

869
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,260
which one of us
is the fisherman?

870
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,940
And which the trout?

871
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,320
Holmes?

872
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,680
- Holmes?
- Uhh..

873
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,200
<i>Take your time,
take your time..</i>

874
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,600
Uh..

875
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,340
Always good to see you, Watson

876
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,460
- what were you thinking?
- Wait

877
01:26:29,461 --> 01:26:30,560
wait..

878
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,440
Well, if you must know, I was thinking
I had him, right where I wanted him

879
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,040
right, crack on then..

880
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,480
Professor

881
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,400
I'm all right, I'm all right

882
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,240
don't waste time attending to me

883
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,200
I'll find them
I'll find them..

884
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,720
Turn in three, two, one

885
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,480
come on, hurry up!

886
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,040
Go!

887
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,680
- Did you see my brother?
- No, but I'm certain he's been here

888
01:27:40,681 --> 01:27:42,640
- where are we going?
- Over that wall

889
01:27:42,641 --> 01:27:45,340
- how do you know I would find you?
- You didn't find me

890
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,800
you collapsed a building on me!

891
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,060
- Where are the horses?
- They're behind!

892
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,160
- We need them.
- You wanna go back?

893
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,520
What's our way out?

894
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,540
That's our way out!

895
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,760
Go! Go!

896
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,920
Come on!

897
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,080
Marko! Marko!

898
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,460
He's not breathing

899
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,310
cradle his head!

900
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,040
Raise his legs!

901
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:40,520
Bloody, you're not
gonna die on me!

902
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,320
I'm not gonna make
this easy on you

903
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,440
come on, come on!

904
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,280
Come on!

905
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:59,400
Come on!

906
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,720
I know you can hear me,
you selfish bastard!

907
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,840
Come on!

908
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,820
I know you can hear
me, you bastard!

909
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,300
His wedding gift..

910
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,040
Terrible dream!

911
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,440
You and Mary and gladstone
and I, were in a restaurant

912
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,140
that satanic pony was there as
well, a massive fork in his hoof!

913
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,760
And he turned on me!

914
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,880
What have you administered?

915
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,840
Your wedding present

916
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,240
who's been dancing on my chest?!

917
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,720
Me..

918
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,360
Why is my ankle so itchy?

919
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:12,260
Because you have a large piece
of wood sticking out of it

920
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,960
good lord! You, Thomas

921
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,780
I have an important job to discuss
with you, remind me of it later

922
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,240
sit down, drink this

923
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,960
I need to get that out
before it turns septic

924
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,720
- did you call me "selfish bastard"?
- Probably

925
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,480
just leave it in! Leave it!

926
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,440
You are a..

927
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,480
- Oh, you are some sort of..
- Be nice

928
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,080
I'm sorry you didn't
get to Brighton

929
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,320
me, too..

930
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,630
- I think we should go home.
- I concur

931
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,920
we're going home

932
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,620
via Switzerland

933
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:22,980
what better place to start
a war than a peace summit?

934
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:28,880
We'll drop in and see my brother,
I'm sure he's missed you

935
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,960
I still don't understand why you
simply don't cancel the summit

936
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,400
the fact is it's going to happen
whether we like it or not

937
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,680
everyone has already arrived

938
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,040
although these gentlemen
may be talking peace

939
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,640
believe me, they're readying
their armies at home

940
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,440
to cancel the summit now
would be tantamount to war

941
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:04,390
- the telegram, wasn't it clear?
- We have doubled the security, sir

942
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:06,580
oh, doubled security,
that's comforting

943
01:37:06,581 --> 01:37:09,460
you don't understand the
delicacy of the situation

944
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:11,500
I passed the telegram
on to my superiors

945
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:15,580
but they're the one who brought moriarty into
advise on the peace process in the first place

946
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,860
he has positioned
himself brilliantly

947
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,240
he's one of our foremost intellectuals,
he's a personal friend..

948
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,800
Personal friend of the prime
ministery as we all know that

949
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:25,900
I believe you, but
where's your evidence?

950
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,600
He's too good to leave evidence

951
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,580
he doesn't leave loose ends

952
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,200
oh, he's alive.

953
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,940
Sherly, put that down

954
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,990
what is this contraption? May I have it?
The effect is most invigorating

955
01:37:39,999 --> 01:37:44,260
that's my private and personal supply
of oxygen, and you're not to touch it

956
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,620
this argument is
getting us nowhere

957
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:51,740
I've arranged for documents to be prepared
which allow you into the ball, carruthers?

958
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,400
Stanley, Stanley

959
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:58,960
you haven't aged a day, is
that my favorite chutney?

960
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,620
The fact is, we don't
really know what he planned

961
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,880
- it would be another bomb.
- No, it wouldn't be another bomb

962
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,120
that doesn't make sense

963
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,920
why would he attack all the
nations, only to unite them?

964
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,980
It should be an assassination

965
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,960
by alone gunman at close range.

966
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:17,920
Rene

967
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,080
unfortunately, yes

968
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:23,640
- you knew.
- I had my suspicions

969
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,990
but having seen who would be
attending, I'm now certain

970
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,640
well, at least we know
who to look out for.

971
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,920
Rene will be the evidence

972
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:35,800
if we can find him and stop him, we
will perhaps not only save his life

973
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:38,720
but prevent the collapse
of Western civilization

974
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,920
no pressure

975
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,560
welcome, ambassador

976
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,720
Professor James moriarty

977
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,960
now we're all present

978
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:40,520
I can tell you that the targets are the
German chancellor and his ambassador

979
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,760
with French prime
minister and his man

980
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:47,820
and the other nations are really working out
which side to take should hostilities erupt

981
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:50,720
cause prince Michael, as cousin of
the tzar, and the Russian ambassador

982
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:54,180
and the archduke Karl Ludwig and
the austro-Hungarian ambassador

983
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,660
the Romanian prime minister
and his ambassador

984
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:01,260
and of course our prime minister
and the British ambassador

985
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:04,760
he'll choose a moment when the dignitaries
are assembled, preferably standing still

986
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,720
is there to be an
official photograph?

987
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,760
Indeed, yes in.. Uh..
38 minutes

988
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,280
in which case, we
might as well dance

989
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,920
I've never done this before

990
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:25,920
just follow my lead

991
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,360
- what do you see?
- Everything

992
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,720
that is my curse

993
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:59,080
but you don't see what
you're looking for

994
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:18,280
I thought you'd never ask

995
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,880
over my shoulder

996
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:26,760
young man, German
uniform, ceremonial sword

997
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,440
got him

998
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,160
professional opinion?

999
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,840
Trauma

1000
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,320
major injury

1001
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:39,000
but excellent repair work.

1002
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,120
Doctor hoffmanstahl

1003
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:46,140
you did say he was at the
forefront of a medical innovation

1004
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,360
we've already seen an
example of his skills

1005
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,760
those twins weren't twins

1006
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:55,360
my suspicions were
aroused in heilbronn

1007
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,880
when one failed to go
to the aid of the other

1008
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:03,280
I also noticed the discreet but
unmistakable puckering behind the ear

1009
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:06,920
where his skin had been drawn
back, I should've realized then

1010
01:42:06,921 --> 01:42:09,600
that they were a
surgical experiment

1011
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,540
to see if it is possible to
make one man look like another

1012
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,560
his face is no longer his own

1013
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:20,220
what better way to guarantee his
world war, than to make the assassin

1014
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:23,200
one of the ambassadors

1015
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:29,440
that narrows down the
possibility to one of six

1016
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:33,120
you and SIM shall
find her brother

1017
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,440
- of this I have no doubt.
- Holmes

1018
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,680
you know my methods

1019
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,400
and I know where you'll be

1020
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:45,920
no possible solution could be
more congenial to me than this

1021
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:49,440
by the way, who taught
you how to dance?

1022
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:51,600
You did

1023
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,000
well, I've done a fine job

1024
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,080
be careful

1025
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:37,200
shall we go to work?

1026
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:43,800
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
gather for the portrait

1027
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,240
I'm sorry

1028
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,640
is this a bad time?

1029
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,000
Never better

1030
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:03,240
- would you bring that clock?
- Hmmhh..

1031
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,800
We get to play that
game after all

1032
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,720
here we are

1033
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,600
don't want you to catch a cold

1034
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,840
a five-minute game?

1035
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,880
If you think you can manage it

1036
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,520
we both have two bishops

1037
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,910
I may be absent from that
room, but my methods are not

1038
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,300
you can't mean doctor
Watson, surely

1039
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,740
that doesn't seem fair

1040
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:24,800
right, the surgery
will have left scars

1041
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,920
only four of them have the
hairline to hide them

1042
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,560
the ambassador that you replaced
with rene, is he still alive?

1043
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,520
Would you like me to
recommend your next move?

1044
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:45,360
They're all my brother's
height, right build, but..

1045
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,320
Their eyes

1046
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,160
their eyes are wrong,
rene has blue eyes

1047
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:55,440
he could be wearing glass
lenses to change the color

1048
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,480
in which case, his
eyes will be hurting.

1049
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:03,600
Rene is left-handed

1050
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,300
perhaps the assassin
will take measures

1051
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,120
to ensure he doesn't
give himself away

1052
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,260
like a gambler concealing a tell

1053
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:18,740
I think it might be him

1054
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,680
you think?

1055
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,840
Your clock is ticking

1056
01:46:22,841 --> 01:46:23,680
you have to be sure

1057
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,640
may I remind you,
this is blitz chess

1058
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,640
a single miscalculation
will cost you the game

1059
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,280
if I tackle the wrong man to the
ground, I could start a war

1060
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:37,880
maybe it's less obvious

1061
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:41,320
a nervous tic, a
ﬂutter of anxiety

1062
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:44,320
I expect everyone has a
reason to be nervous tonight

1063
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,400
I don't know

1064
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:00,560
so perhaps it's the opposite..

1065
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:03,420
Failure to behave naturally

1066
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,820
an actor so consumed
with his performance

1067
01:47:06,821 --> 01:47:09,640
that the one characteristic
he cannot accommodate

1068
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,940
is spontaneous reaction.

1069
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:05,000
Carruthers, protect
the prime minister!

1070
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:17,060
Germany will pay!
Mark my words!

1071
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,580
That doesn't bode well, does it?

1072
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:25,600
Seems your bishop was of
some benefit, after all

1073
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,660
the game is still young

1074
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:29,860
actually, it's in
its adolescence

1075
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,520
there are more of us!

1076
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,600
Germany will pay!

1077
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:51,240
No loose ends

1078
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:59,760
what happened to him?
I'm a doctor, a doctor!

1079
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,840
What happened?

1080
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,140
<i>- Curare (Muscle paralyzer)
- What's wrong with him?</i>

1081
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:26,000
It's poison

1082
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:27,800
do something!

1083
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:33,800
Doctor, do something!

1084
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,200
No

1085
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:56,120
I think you've just lost
your most valuable piece

1086
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:00,920
but a winning strategy sometimes
necessitates sacrifice

1087
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:02,960
a war has been averted

1088
01:50:02,990 --> 01:50:05,620
hmm.. Oh, I disagree

1089
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,220
how so?

1090
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:11,580
Didn't you find it strange,
that the telegram you sent

1091
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:13,880
didn't inspire any
action to stop me?

1092
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:21,360
You see, hidden within
the unconscious

1093
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,580
is an insatiable
desire for conflict

1094
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:32,760
so you're not fighting me, so much
as you are the human condition

1095
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,160
all I want to do is own the
bullets and the bandages

1096
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:43,560
war on an industrial
scale is inevitable

1097
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,080
they'll do it themselves
within a few years

1098
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:52,120
all I have to do is wait

1099
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,320
I like Switzerland

1100
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:02,440
they respect a
man's privacy here

1101
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,600
particularly if he has a fortune

1102
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,200
bishop takes knight, check!

1103
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,800
The game is over

1104
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,720
you should get that
shoulder looked at

1105
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:23,200
about that fortune of yours

1106
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:28,520
I believe it's just been
substantially reduced.

1107
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:30,820
King to rook two

1108
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,820
I attended several
of your lectures

1109
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,280
the equations of motion, which
you will find in my book

1110
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,840
the energy that is required to
release these explosions is

1111
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:42,400
it was in oslo when I first caught
a glimpse of your little notebook

1112
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:45,460
red leather-bound from
smythson of bond street

1113
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:49,100
rook to king's
rook three, check!

1114
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,340
Bishop to rook three

1115
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:04,680
<i>until I observed your
penchant for feeding pigeons</i>

1116
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:08,800
then it occurred that with
an empire so enormous

1117
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:12,200
even you must keep a
record of it somewhere

1118
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,760
bishop takes bishop

1119
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:16,500
rook to bishop four

1120
01:52:16,501 --> 01:52:19,040
I then only required
the notebook itself

1121
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,600
you didn't make it easy

1122
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:23,960
just the bags

1123
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:27,020
I would dare to endure a
considerable amount of pain.

1124
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:30,000
Mycroft

1125
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,800
care of her majesty's
secret service

1126
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:39,040
but the notebook would undoubtedly be
encoded, so how then to break the code?

1127
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:42,560
- Rook takes rook.
- Pawn takes rook

1128
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,520
bishop to bishop seven

1129
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:47,140
queen takes knight pawn

1130
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:52,160
<i>does <font color="#00ffff">the art of domestic
horticulture</font> mean anything to you?</i>

1131
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,000
How could a man as meticulous
as you own such a book

1132
01:52:56,060 --> 01:53:00,580
yet completely neglect the flowers
in his own window box? Irony abounds

1133
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,700
never mind, it's safe, in London

1134
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:12,480
where my colleagues are
making good use of it

1135
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,560
the most formidable criminal mind in
Europe has just had all his money stolen

1136
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:22,320
<i>by perhaps the most inept inspector
in the history of Scotland yard</i>

1137
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:23,920
any chance of a cup of tea?

1138
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,760
Box 0403

1139
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,760
- tick!
- Box 0801

1140
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:34,040
- how much more is there?
- That's the end of page two

1141
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,400
page three..

1142
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:43,400
<i>Be careful what you fish for!</i>

1143
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:50,920
He'll be making an anonymous donation
to the widows and orphans of war fund

1144
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:54,440
bishop to bishop eight..
Discover check!

1145
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:57,240
And, incidentally, mate!

1146
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:04,200
I seem to have injured my
shoulder, would you mind?

1147
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,640
Be my pleasure

1148
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:18,480
once we've concluded
our business here

1149
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:21,160
it's important you know

1150
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:25,480
I shall endeavor to find the most
creative of endings for the doctor

1151
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,160
and his wife

1152
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,920
<i>his advantage, my injury</i>

1153
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:40,080
<i>my advantage, his rage</i>

1154
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:46,320
<i>incoming assault,
feral, but experienced</i>

1155
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:49,440
<i>use his momentum to counter</i>

1156
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,760
<i>come now</i>

1157
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,520
<i>you really think you're the
only one who can play this game</i>

1158
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:05,280
<i>trap arm, target weakness</i>

1159
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:07,520
follow with haymaker

1160
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:10,680
<i>ah.. There we find the
boxing champion of Cambridge</i>

1161
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:13,200
<i>competent, but predictable</i>

1162
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:18,440
<i>now allow me to reply</i>

1163
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,280
<i>arsenal running dry..
Adjust strategy</i>

1164
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:29,560
<i>wound taking its toll</i>

1165
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:34,200
<i>as I feared, injury
makes defense untenable</i>

1166
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:43,320
<i>prognosis,
increasingly negative</i>

1167
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:50,800
<i>let's not waste any more
of one another's time</i>

1168
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:58,600
<i>we both know how this ends</i>

1169
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:14,760
<i>conclusion, inevitable</i>

1170
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,600
<i>unless..</i>

1171
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:31,880
<i>A few words may suffice to
tell the little that remains..</i>

1172
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,360
<i>Any attempt at finding the
bodies was absolutely hopeless..</i>

1173
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,680
<i>And so there..</i>

1174
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:56,760
<i>Deep down in that dreadful couldron
of swirling water and seething foam</i>

1175
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:03,480
<i>will lie for all time..</i>

1176
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:09,040
<i>The most dangerous criminal</i>

1177
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:15,360
<i>and the foremost champion of
the law of their generation..</i>

1178
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:23,800
<i>I shall ever regard
him as the best..</i>

1179
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:32,760
<i>And the wisest man
whom I have ever known</i>

1180
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,600
John?

1181
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:39,320
- John.
- Uhumm..

1182
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,560
You should probably pack

1183
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:42,840
it's half past two

1184
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,920
- and the carriage is coming at four.
- Hmm

1185
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:48,680
it's gonna be a beautiful
week in Brighton

1186
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:51,320
yes, it'll be fun

1187
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,280
I'm looking forward to it

1188
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,240
you know I miss him too

1189
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:59,600
in my own way

1190
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:08,780
he would have wanted us to go

1191
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:12,760
he would have wanted
to come with us

1192
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:16,600
when's Mrs. Hudson
coming for gladstone?

1193
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:18,960
Oh, soon

1194
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:22,760
three o'clock

1195
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,400
Mary?

1196
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:54,120
Who delivered this parcel?

1197
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:56,240
A postman

1198
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:59,960
the usual chap or..

1199
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:03,160
Did he look peculiar?

1200
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:12,120
