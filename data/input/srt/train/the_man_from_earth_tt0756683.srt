1
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,998
Hey, buddy.

2
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:47,033
You don't waste time, do you?

3
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:48,732
I try not to.

4
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:50,067
Well, you need help?

5
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:51,167
Sure.

6
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,599
Would you like to tell us...

7
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:59,033
what the hell that was all about?

8
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:00,365
I don't like good-byes.

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,233
Kind of the point of
a goodbye party, John.

10
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:05,784
Went to a certain amount
of trouble, you know?

11
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:08,265
Could've at least stayed
a few minutes, huh?

12
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,200
Eaten some of the food
we so feverishly prepared?

13
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:13,799
I apologize, Harry.

14
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,399
But why are you moving so quickly?

15
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:17,534
You only resigned a couple of days ago.

16
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,634
You got the history chair at Stanford.

17
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:20,732
I wish.

18
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,933
Well, taquitos, chicken wings,

19
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:24,817
Roastie-toasties and beer.

20
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,632
If we'd had more time,

21
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,701
We'd have done something
a little more grandiose.

22
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:30,467
Candlelight dinner at McDonald's.

23
00:01:30,502 --> 00:01:32,032
Strippers.

24
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:33,868
Taquitos are fine.

25
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:35,799
A'right.

26
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,599
Art's gonna be along, too.

27
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:39,400
He's, uh, talking to a student. Pfft.

28
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:41,299
Is George taking over for you?

29
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,000
George or Trimbell - Has
the Dean made up his mind?

30
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:45,100
He hasn't called.

31
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:46,132
My god!

32
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,566
Wh-What is this?

33
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:48,866
It looks like a Van Gogh,

34
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,351
But I've never seen it before.

35
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:51,766
Is that an original, John?

36
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:54,133
No, it's just a gift someone gave me.

37
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:56,117
Still, it's a superb copy.

38
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:58,076
Contemporaneous, I think,

39
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,000
May I take a closer look?

40
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:01,133
Please, yeah.

41
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,934
Yeah, it's the same
stretcher as Van Gogh used.

42
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,534
Yeah, there's writing
on the back in french.

43
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,968
Oh, "To my friend Jacque Bourne."

44
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:12,199
Wonder who that was?

45
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:13,699
Someone he knew, I guess.

46
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,399
Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.

47
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:18,334
Surely you'll have this
looked at, appraised?

48
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:20,332
Well, maybe sometime,

49
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:23,601
But I wouldn't really want money for it.

50
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,299
That does it.

51
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:29,165
Put that stuff in the kitchen.

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,701
No, I'm gonna put it
in the bathroom, John.

53
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,968
Gas is off, electricity's on.

54
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,199
Get comfortable while you can.

55
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:40,734
The furniture's going this afternoon.

56
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:43,234
It's been years since I sat on a floor.

57
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:45,184
Heh. I can't remember her name.

58
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,826
Eh, it's good for the back.

59
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,714
Can we do yoga exercises?

60
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,567
Tantric yoga, we can.

61
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:51,899
( Chuckles )

62
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:54,534
So you're leaving good old "We teach you"?

63
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,601
Rather suddenly, you must admit.

64
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,285
Truth time, John.

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,934
Is there a problem?

66
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,299
No.

67
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,517
Oh, come on, you know we wanna help.

68
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,701
That's appreciated,
but really--

69
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:08,735
There's no problem.

70
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,352
Well, now I am curious.

71
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:11,660
Where are you going?

72
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:12,899
Givin' up tenure...

73
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:14,899
a decade of professorship,

74
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:17,332
In line to chair the department,

75
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:20,200
And you don't know where you're going?

76
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:21,666
Call it cabin fever.

77
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,200
After a while, I get itchy feet.

78
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:25,499
I've done this before.

79
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:28,601
No, no, no, you're too young
to have done this before.

80
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:30,901
And he hasn't aged a day in ten years.

81
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,432
Every woman on the faculty

82
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,033
Would give anything to have that secret.

83
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:36,634
Is that what they're after, Edith?

84
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,300
Oh, stop, Harry.

85
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:41,098
( Giggles )

86
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,701
Wow, can you pull this?

87
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:45,717
What the hell?

88
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:47,043
What do you hunt?

89
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:48,289
Deer, mostly.

90
00:03:48,324 --> 00:03:49,466
Around big bear.

91
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,866
With a bow and arrow?

92
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:52,632
Most people can't bag a deer

93
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,667
With a rifle and a telescopic sight.

94
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,285
Though, good eatin'.

95
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,833
The best wild game.

96
00:03:57,868 --> 00:03:59,634
Lives naturally, eats naturally.

97
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, it's beautiful.

98
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,100
( Motor hums )

99
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:05,834
Art.

100
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:09,165
Ah.

101
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,467
So, can I get an "a" for awesome?

102
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,518
Oh, my gosh.

103
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,776
( Chuckles )

104
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,289
That was fun.

105
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,732
Hey, John.

106
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:20,200
You know Linda. You
had her last semester.

107
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:21,566
Hi. Hey.

108
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:23,734
She's one of my victims
now. I'm taking her home.

109
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,400
She wanted to come by
and say hello goodbye.

110
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:26,867
Is Art as tough as I hear?

111
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:28,265
Oh, archaeology's tough.

112
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,634
Dr. Jenkins is a fine teacher.

113
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,285
Oh, that's very politic.

114
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,866
It's very true. Uh-huh.

115
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,365
Something for you to
read on the road, pal.

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,300
<i>"Shadows of the cave:
parallels to early man."</i>

117
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:40,734
Author: M. Jenkins.

118
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:41,951
Publish or perish.

119
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:43,098
I'd rather read

120
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,200
Than write another one.

121
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:46,133
Thank you.

122
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:47,399
Hi.

123
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,684
Oh, everybody, this is Linda.

124
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:51,934
Linda, this is everybody.

125
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:53,501
Linda. Hi.

126
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:55,766
So.

127
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,300
Where you going, John,
like we give a damn?

128
00:04:58,335 --> 00:04:59,501
We've already covered that.

129
00:04:59,536 --> 00:05:01,965
John's got itchy feet.

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,300
There are over-the-counter
remedies for that, John.

131
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:05,734
( Laughs )

132
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:08,567
So there is a problem.

133
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,365
No.

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,701
I just like to move on now and then.

135
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:14,067
It's a personal thing.

136
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:17,534
Well, not to pry.

137
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,965
I'm sorry I don't
have more to offer you.

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,534
Got conversation, some
seats for your behinds,

139
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:31,601
And, uh...

140
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,868
Is he ducking out on us again?

141
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,965
...I do have this.

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,632
Oh ho ho! Johnny Walker Green!

143
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,434
( Laughs ) didn't even
know they made it in green.

144
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:49,899
What do they pay you?

145
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,866
Nothing is too good for my friends.

146
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,868
But I'm sorry-- We are
down to plastic cups now.

147
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:56,868
That's a sacrilege I'll tolerate.

148
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:58,551
I will do the honors.

149
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:00,200
Oh, come to papa.

150
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,300
Ooh! Here, cups, cups.

151
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:04,367
There we go.

152
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:05,501
Step on in here.

153
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:06,566
There ya go...

154
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:09,067
one for the birthday
boy-- Excuse me. Art?

155
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,199
No, not for me.

156
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:11,599
Oh, no, I don't drink.

157
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:13,667
( Laughs ) we're not
gonna card you, darling.

158
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:15,701
All right, here, join
the circle at least.

159
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:20,400
Well, to long life and good fortune

160
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:21,965
To our esteemed friend

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,917
And colleague, John Oldman.

162
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:25,834
May he find undeserved bliss

163
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:27,067
Wherever he goes.

164
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:28,065
Here, here.

165
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,984
<i>Skael. Na zdorovye.</i>

166
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:31,868
One off the top, John.

167
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:38,701
Mm! Oh, that's good.

168
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:39,901
Excuse me.

169
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:45,501
John, we're all sorry to see you go.

170
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:46,601
Truly.

171
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,199
Okay. Now we're done with that,

172
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:53,234
What do we do for the
rest of the afternoon?

173
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:55,051
Anyone got a good topic?

174
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:56,834
Like this, maybe? Heh.

175
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:57,866
What is that?

176
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,634
It's a burin of a parrot beak.

177
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,484
Inclined chisel point...

178
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,300
probably early Magdalenian.

179
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:06,567
May I see that? Sure.

180
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,400
Yes indeed, that's what it is.

181
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:16,833
What's a burin?

182
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,499
A burin is a flint tool

183
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:21,133
For grooving wood and
bone, antlers especially,

184
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:23,632
To make spear and harpoon points.

185
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,667
Magdalenians weren't
noted for flint work,

186
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:27,434
So this is a very nice specimen.

187
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:29,934
Okay, what's a Magdalenian?

188
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,365
A later Cro-magnon,

189
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,699
Without gettin' technical.

190
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:35,868
It's the final culture
of the upper paleolithic.

191
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,685
If stones could speak, eh, Art?

192
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,432
So where'd you get that, John?

193
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,033
Believe it or not, from
a thrift shop-- A quarter.

194
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:43,599
You lucky dog!

195
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:45,901
I gotta go digging
for this kind of stuff.

196
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:47,133
Can I, uh...?

197
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,167
Yeah.

198
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:52,701
Huh.

199
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,432
Maybe...

200
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,032
I'm glad you did this.

201
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,868
Did what? You mean come over?

202
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,599
Maybe?

203
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:06,917
Definitely.

204
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:08,276
Gee, thanks.

205
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:09,601
Well, so are we.

206
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,032
So are we.

207
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,200
We couldn't let you just run off.

208
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:14,400
Thanks.

209
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:18,199
John, what is up, huh?

210
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,734
<i>Are you on America's most wanted?</i>

211
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:20,899
We won't turn you in.

212
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,300
Yeah, come on, out with it.

213
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,300
You're among friends.

214
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,567
Snoopy friends.

215
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:25,599
Forget it.

216
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:27,265
You are creating the mystery here.

217
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,601
Obviously, you have something
you'd like to say. Say it!

218
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:32,868
Well, maybe I...

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,234
ten, nine, eight, seven...

220
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:36,300
Harry, stop.

221
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,666
There is something I'm
tempted to tell you, I think.

222
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:44,300
I've never done this before,
and I wonder how it'll pan out.

223
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,133
( Harry chuckles )

224
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,767
I wonder if I could ask
you a silly question.

225
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:50,766
John, we're teachers.

226
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,734
We answer silly questions all the time.

227
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:53,833
Hey!

228
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:57,534
What if a man from the upper paleolithic

229
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:59,368
Survived until the present day?

230
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:01,167
What do you mean, survived?

231
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,499
Never died?

232
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,350
Yes. What would he be like?

233
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:06,132
Well, I know some guys.

234
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,984
You ever been to the Ozarks?

235
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,766
It's an interesting idea.

236
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,300
What, are you working on
a science fiction story?

237
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,567
Say I am. What would he be like?

238
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:15,884
Pretty tired.

239
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,743
( Laughter )

240
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,532
Well, seriously,

241
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,734
As Art's book title suggests,

242
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,901
He might be like any of us.

243
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:25,199
Dan. A caveman?

244
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:27,051
Well, there's no anatomical difference

245
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:28,833
Between, say, a Cro-magnon and us.

246
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,267
Except that as a rule,
we've grown taller.

247
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:33,632
What's the selective
advantage of height?

248
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,400
Better to see predators
in tall grass, my dear.

249
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:38,699
Actually, tall and skinny

250
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:41,601
Radiates heat more
effectively in warmer climates.

251
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:42,899
And as for neanderthals,

252
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,634
I mean, we've all seen apish people.

253
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:45,868
That strain's still with us.

254
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:48,000
But he'd be a caveman.

255
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:49,032
No, he wouldn't.

256
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,065
John's hypothetical man

257
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,868
Would have lived
through 140 centuries...

258
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:53,265
yeah, roughly.

259
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,683
...and changed with every one of them.

260
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:58,032
I mean, assuming normal intelligence.

261
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,534
Well, we think men of
the upper paleolithic

262
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:02,401
Were as intelligent as we are.

263
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,199
They just didn't know as much.

264
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:07,200
John's man would have
learned as the race learned.

265
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:10,368
In fact, if he had an inquiring mind,

266
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:13,466
His knowledge might be astonishing.

267
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:15,767
If you do write that,
let me have a look at it.

268
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:18,033
I'm sure you'll make some
anthropological boners.

269
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:19,132
It's a deal.

270
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,017
What would keep him alive?

271
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,868
What does the biologist say?

272
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:24,532
Cigarettes.

273
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,365
And ice cream. ( Laughs )

274
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,499
All right, all right, I'll play.

275
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:32,234
All right, um, in science fiction terms,

276
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:33,901
I would say...

277
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,234
perfect regeneration
of the body's cells,

278
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,365
Especially in the vital organs.

279
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,267
Actually, the human
body appears designed

280
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,365
To live about 190 years.

281
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,234
Most of us just die of slow poisoning.

282
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:50,766
Maybe he did something right,

283
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:54,100
Something everybody else
in history had done wrong.

284
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,532
What, like eat the food,

285
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,567
Drink the water, and breathe the air?

286
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,551
Prior to modern times,

287
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:01,466
Those were pristine.

288
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:05,968
We've extended our lifespan
in a world that's, uh...

289
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:07,866
not fit to live in.

290
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,365
You know, it could happen.

291
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,701
The pancreas turns over
cells every 24 hours,

292
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:13,335
The stomach lining in three days,

293
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,934
The entire body in seven years,

294
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,499
But the process falters.

295
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:19,334
Waste accumulates, eventually
proves fatal to function.

296
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:22,000
Now if a quirk in his immune system

297
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:23,766
Led to perfect detox,

298
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:25,767
Perfect renewal, then yeah.

299
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:28,032
He could duck decay.

300
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,300
Mm, that's a secret
we'd all love to have.

301
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,267
Would you really want to do that?

302
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:35,199
Live 14,000 years?

303
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:38,033
Well, if I could stay
healthy and I didn't age,

304
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:39,199
I mean, why not?

305
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:41,400
Yeah. What a chance to learn.

306
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,265
Is anyone hungry?

307
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,167
You know, the more I think
about it, yeah, it's possible.

308
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:48,766
Anything is possible, right?

309
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:52,067
After all, one century's magic,
another century's science.

310
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:54,234
They thought Columbus
was a nut job, right?

311
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,332
Pasteur, Copernicus?

312
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:57,000
Aristarchus long before that.

313
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:58,132
Right.

314
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,484
I had a chance to sail with Columbus,

315
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,893
Only I'm not the adventurous type.

316
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:05,864
I was pretty sure the earth was round,

317
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,616
But at that point, I still thought

318
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,334
He might fall off an edge someplace...

319
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,667
look around, John.

320
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,098
We just did.

321
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,467
I suppose there's a
joke in there somewhere,

322
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:28,968
But I don't get it.

323
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:30,768
There's nothing to get.

324
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:32,499
What are we talking about?

325
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,434
We were just talking about a caveman

326
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,834
Who survives until the present time.

327
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:39,200
As you said, what a chance to learn,

328
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:40,634
Once I learned to learn.

329
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,868
Did you start the whiskey
before we got here?

330
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:49,834
Pretend it's science fiction.

331
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,632
Figure it out.

332
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:56,167
Okay, a--( Laughs )--
Very old Cro-magnon

333
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:57,734
Living until the present.

334
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,300
( Grunts loudly )

335
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:01,332
Oh!

336
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:05,501
( Laughing )

337
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,599
What?

338
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:10,534
John just confided that
he's 14,000 years old.

339
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:14,167
Oh, John, you don't look a day over 900.

340
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:15,432
Okay, okay.

341
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,200
All right, Spock, I'll
play your little game.

342
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:19,918
What do you want? What's the punch line?

343
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:22,601
Every ten years or so, when people start

344
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,367
To notice I don't age, I move on.

345
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:29,384
That's very good,
that's very quick, John.

346
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,801
I wanna read that
story when you're done.

347
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:33,332
You want more?

348
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,234
By all means. This is great.

349
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:36,267
All right, now...

350
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:37,299
( laughs )

351
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,968
So you think that you are a...

352
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:41,065
a, uh, Cro-magnon.

353
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,667
Well, I didn't learn it in school.

354
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:44,399
That's my best guess,

355
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:48,901
Based on archaeological data,
maps, anthropological research.

356
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,299
Since Mesopotamia,

357
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:53,500
I've got the last...
4,000 years straight.

358
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,667
You're ahead of most
people, so please, go on.

359
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,267
Well, you know the background stuff,

360
00:13:58,302 --> 00:13:59,732
So I'll make it brief.

361
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,234
In what I call my first lifetime,

362
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,968
I aged to about 35...

363
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:05,632
what you see.

364
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,801
I ended up leading my group.

365
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:09,666
They saw me as magical.

366
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:12,732
I didn't even have to fight for it.

367
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,634
Then fear came, and they chased me away.

368
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,165
They thought that I was

369
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,534
Stealing their lives away to stay young.

370
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:21,868
The prehistoric origin
of the vampire myth.

371
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,833
That is good!

372
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:23,899
First thousand years,

373
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:26,032
I didn't know up from sideways.

374
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,501
How do you know the
first thousand years?

375
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,068
An informed guess, based on what

376
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,566
I've learned in my memories.

377
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,667
Most people can scarcely
remember their childhood,

378
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:35,767
But you have memories of that time?

379
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:37,365
Like yours, selective.

380
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,767
You know, the high points,
the low points, traumas.

381
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:42,532
They stick in the mind forever.

382
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:46,467
Put down at 3 or 35,
you still feel a twinge.

383
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:50,265
Go on.

384
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,350
I kept getting chased
because I wouldn't die,

385
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:56,776
So I got the hang of
joining new groups I found.

386
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:00,167
I also got the idea of
periodically moving on.

387
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,799
We were semi-Nomadic, of course,

388
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,801
Following the weather
and the game we hunted.

389
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,799
The first 2,000 years were cold.

390
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:10,434
We learned it was warmer
at lower elevations.

391
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:13,068
Late glacial period, I assume.

392
00:15:13,103 --> 00:15:15,667
What was the terrain like?

393
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:18,833
Mountainous.

394
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,734
Vast plains to the west.

395
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,868
West--Something you
learned in school.

396
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:27,499
Towards the setting sun.

397
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,867
I suspect I saw the British Isles

398
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:32,200
From what is now the french coast.

399
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:33,866
Huge mountains...

400
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:36,634
on the other side of
an enormous deep valley

401
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,585
That was shadowed by the setting sun.

402
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,466
This is before they were separated

403
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:43,133
From the continent by rising
seas, as glaciers melted.

404
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,732
That happened?

405
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,901
Yes, the end of the Pleistocene.

406
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:49,968
So far, what he says fits.

407
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:52,035
Oh, yeah, into any textbook.

408
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,032
And that's where I found it.

409
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,934
How can I have knowledgeable recall

410
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:57,918
If I didn't have knowledge?

411
00:15:57,953 --> 00:15:59,833
It's all retrospective.

412
00:15:59,868 --> 00:16:02,334
All I can do is
integrate my recollections

413
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,132
With modern findings.

414
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,834
Caveman, you gonna hit me
over the head with a club

415
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,518
And drag me into the bedroom?

416
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:10,167
You'd be more fun conscious.

417
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,132
Oh, John.

418
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,432
Let me get this straight.

419
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,317
We're not talking about reincarnation.

420
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:16,167
You're not saying that you remember

421
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:17,601
Whatever the hell it would be,

422
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:18,965
200 separate lifetimes, dying

423
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,400
And being born again and yada yada?

424
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:22,901
One lifetime.

425
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,434
Some lifetime.

426
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:26,766
Wow.

427
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:29,267
Maybe there is something
to this reincarnation thing.

428
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:30,566
You're supposed to come back

429
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,201
Again and again, learn and learn,

430
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:33,801
And somehow, John, you just managed

431
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:35,367
To bypass all the other bodies.

432
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:37,667
Well, what's the point?

433
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,532
What about oceans?

434
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,866
Didn't see them till much later.

435
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:47,234
So how would you know
an ocean from a lake?

436
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,098
Big waves--
Something else

437
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,332
I can only surmise in retrospect.

438
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,367
Were you curious about
where it all came from?

439
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:57,034
We would look up at the sky and wonder.

440
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:59,234
"There's gotta be
some big guys up there.

441
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,033
What else made all this down here?"

442
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:02,566
At first I thought

443
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:05,201
There was something
wrong with me--

444
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:07,801
Maybe I was a bad guy for not dying.

445
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:12,200
Then I began to wonder if I was cursed

446
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:14,499
Or perhaps blessed.

447
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,200
Then I thought maybe I had a mission.

448
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:19,984
Do you still think you do?

449
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,734
God works in mysterious ways.

450
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:25,133
I think I just happened.

451
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:26,634
( Phone ringing )

452
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,834
( Laughs )

453
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:33,968
Wow.

454
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:35,067
Hello?

455
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,983
Yes, Ellie?

456
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:39,834
What's wrong?

457
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:40,984
Sandy?

458
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,100
Coming.

459
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,365
Yeah?

460
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,133
Do we have Ellie's midterm here?

461
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,599
Yeah, sorry.

462
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:54,100
I picked it up with the periodicals.

463
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:55,432
Got it.

464
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:57,167
No, you're worried about your parents?

465
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,300
Don't--Don't
worry.

466
00:17:58,335 --> 00:17:59,965
You passed, c+.

467
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
Take care of yourself.

468
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:03,833
Good kid.

469
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:05,701
What does pre-Med need with history?

470
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,068
Got it.

471
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:08,400
Thank you.

472
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:11,866
Sorry, guys.

473
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:13,599
John, please continue.

474
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,868
Come on, I thought we
were done with that.

475
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:17,501
No! Let's go on with it.

476
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:18,899
It's interesting.

477
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:21,767
Besides, I think he's making
a certain amount of sense.

478
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:24,367
Like Hegel-- Logic
from absurd premises.

479
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,185
That Van Gogh?

480
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,933
He gave it to me.

481
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:30,667
I was, uh, Jacque Bourne at the time,

482
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:31,917
A pig farmer.

483
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:33,259
A pig farmer?

484
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:34,532
( Laughing )

485
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,632
I like to work with my hands.

486
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,767
He would come out to the place, paint.

487
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:40,868
We talked about capturing nature in Art.

488
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:43,035
Turner, Cezanne, Pissaro.

489
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,002
Oh, the Nolde landscapes.

490
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:46,899
Not in Van Gogh's time.

491
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:48,467
He would have loved them, though.

492
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,499
Yes.

493
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:51,232
Well, I don't understand

494
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:53,434
Why you can't remember
where you're from.

495
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:55,234
Geography hasn't changed.

496
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,933
I learned
that in--

497
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,267
Professor Hensen's tepid lectures.

498
00:18:58,302 --> 00:18:59,699
But you're right.

499
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:01,868
Where did you live when
you were five years old?

500
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:02,998
Little rock.

501
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,033
Your mother, she took you to the market?

502
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:06,367
Mm-hmm. What direction was it?

503
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:07,784
From your house.

504
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:09,167
I don't know.

505
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:10,132
How far?

506
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,032
Um, three blocks.

507
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,567
Were there any references

508
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,032
That stuck in your mind?

509
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:16,534
Well, there was a gas station

510
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,132
And a big field.

511
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,300
I was told I could never go there alone.

512
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:21,968
And if you went back there today,

513
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,466
Would it be the same?

514
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:26,367
No. I'm sure it's all
different and built up.

515
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:29,234
Thus the saying-- "You
can't go home again"

516
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,534
Because it isn't there anymore.

517
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,332
Picture it
on my scale--

518
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:35,667
I migrated through an endless flat space

519
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:38,098
Full of endless
new things--

520
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:42,968
Forests, mountains, tundra, canyons.

521
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:46,551
My memory sees what I saw then.

522
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,876
My eye sees freeways, urban sprawl,

523
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:53,132
Big macs under the Eiffel tower.

524
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,868
Early on, the world
got bigger and bigger,

525
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,199
And then...

526
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,033
think what I've had to unlearn.

527
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:01,899
And now you're moving on.

528
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,634
As you've said, there's
talk of my not aging,

529
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:07,432
And when that happens, I move on.

530
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:11,033
Well, it might make sense
to set up your next identity,

531
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:14,334
Your next ten years, and
then just drop into it.

532
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,118
I've done that a few times,

533
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:17,977
Even passed as my own son.

534
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:19,766
"Oh, you're an engineer, too?

535
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,299
You're Ben's son. He was a good man."

536
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,984
Saves trouble with
credentials and references.

537
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:27,634
On the other hand, I've
been busted a few times.

538
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:30,701
Spent a year in
jail, Belgium, 1862--

539
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:32,365
I won't
forget that--

540
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
For faking a government application.

541
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:36,299
When'd you come to America?

542
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,467
1890, right after Van Gogh's death,

543
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:40,534
With some french immigrants...

544
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,133
moving on.

545
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:47,968
An answer for every question.

546
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:49,732
Except one, John.

547
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,100
Why're you doing this?

548
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:56,100
A whim. Maybe not such a good idea.

549
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:57,666
I...

550
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:00,801
wanted to say goodbye to you as me,

551
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:02,751
Not what you thought I was.

552
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:04,632
Well, since this isn't funny,

553
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:07,100
We think you might have a problem.

554
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,901
A very serious problem.

555
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,983
I've got boxes to move.

556
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:13,767
I'll give you a hand.

557
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:19,767
Wouldn't you have
some relic, an artifact

558
00:21:19,802 --> 00:21:22,200
To remind you of your early life?

559
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:23,701
Like this, maybe?

560
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:25,100
Thrift shop.

561
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:26,200
Really.

562
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:30,868
If you lived 100... 1,000 years...

563
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,866
would you still have this?

564
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,867
What would cause you to keep it?

565
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:38,834
As a memento to your beginnings,

566
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:40,368
Even if you didn't have

567
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:42,435
The concept of beginnings?

568
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,467
It would be gone, lost.

569
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:46,666
No.

570
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,501
I don't have artifacts.

571
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:52,367
Keep that.

572
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:55,734
Interesting.

573
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,500
You could have lied about that.

574
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,634
Don't talk about me while I'm gone.

575
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:11,466
Is he serious?

576
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,265
If he is, I'm sorry to say he's...

577
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,200
oh, how could he have
concealed that for ten years?

578
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,334
Least he doesn't appear to be dangerous.

579
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:23,199
What are you doing?

580
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:25,234
Checkin' for a hidden mic.

581
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:26,601
<i>Candid camera.</i>

582
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,384
He's fabricating these wild stories.

583
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,334
I've never seen him acting like this.

584
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:34,466
Oh, it's crazy.

585
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:37,934
All right, all right,
as soon as you can, then.

586
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,167
I love you, you know.

587
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:48,968
I know.

588
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:53,501
Since my first week at the office.

589
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:58,532
And?

590
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:01,899
I care very much about you,

591
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:04,501
But now you know what
you'd be getting into.

592
00:23:04,536 --> 00:23:06,434
Do you really think you're a caveman?

593
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,033
Do you?

594
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,299
Could you love me,

595
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,734
Or don't you believe in that anymore?

596
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,400
I've gotten over it too many times.

597
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,434
Fond of you...

598
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:28,133
certainly attracted to you.

599
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:31,467
That's it?

600
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,000
I can work with that.

601
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,750
If what I'm saying is true,

602
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:45,300
You and any children will age.

603
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:46,599
I won't.

604
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,566
And one day I'll leave.

605
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:51,567
You'll go back to your
May-December romances.

606
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:52,732
The simple fact is

607
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,767
That I can't give you forever.

608
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,167
How long's forever?

609
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,100
Who ever really has it?

610
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:08,684
My parents split up before I was born,

611
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:11,634
And then my mom's next marriage lasted

612
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:13,100
What, a whole three years?

613
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,033
Then there's death,
illness, acts of god...

614
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,200
no one knows how long they have.

615
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:25,634
Or how little.

616
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,434
I love you.

617
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:33,968
Take whatever you can get.

618
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,534
Like ten years?

619
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,983
Ah! Ha ha ha!

620
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,400
( Yells )

621
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:48,417
Uhn!

622
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:49,365
Oh.

623
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,432
Why did you do that?

624
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:54,100
I wanted to see how fast you
were. Check your reflexes.

625
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:56,267
I don't have eyes in
the back of my head,

626
00:24:56,302 --> 00:24:58,068
I can't hear a flea walking,

627
00:24:58,103 --> 00:24:59,799
I am not in any way superman.

628
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,267
Well, I'm a second-degree black belt.

629
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:04,100
Give it another thousand years.

630
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:07,767
Well. I got it, I got it, I got it.

631
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:10,332
Jesus.

632
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,234
Smooth demonstration, Harry.

633
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:14,267
Sit on it, Dan.

634
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,033
I still have questions.

635
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:18,833
I-I do too, John.

636
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:21,467
I mean, are we done with prehistory yet?

637
00:25:21,502 --> 00:25:24,384
Remember any of your original language?

638
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,267
A little. One thing
hasn't changed much...

639
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:28,667
( wolf whistles )

640
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:32,866
Did you ever do any cave Art?

641
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:34,934
Do you know the rock Art at Les Eyzies?

642
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:36,098
Mm-hmm.

643
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:38,467
It was the work of a man named...

644
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,065
Giraud.

645
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,750
He did a pretty good job.

646
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:45,226
He would draw the animals

647
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:47,581
That we hoped to find to eat.

648
00:25:47,616 --> 00:25:49,691
One day after a fruitless hunt,

649
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:51,847
Our chief stomped his teeth out

650
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,933
Because his magic had failed him.

651
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:57,033
After that, someone had
to chew his food for him.

652
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:58,868
Finally, he
got-- I suspect--

653
00:25:58,903 --> 00:26:00,965
An infected jaw,

654
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,667
And he was abandoned.

655
00:26:02,702 --> 00:26:04,466
That's awful.

656
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:06,317
You have to know what to kill.

657
00:26:06,352 --> 00:26:08,098
Is this why all your students

658
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,467
Say your knowledge of history is...

659
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,532
so amazing?

660
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,632
No, that's mostly based on study.

661
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:17,934
Remember, it's one man,
one place at a time,

662
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:20,232
My solitary viewpoint

663
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:22,968
Of a world I knew almost nothing about.

664
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:24,199
Well, let's talk about

665
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,267
What you say you
do know about--

666
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:27,717
Historical times.

667
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,133
Don't encourage him.

668
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:30,332
Edith.

669
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:33,200
Next few thousand years, it got warmer.

670
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:34,599
A few thousand
years--

671
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,134
See, now, I know you're guessing.

672
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,634
You can't get there from here, Art.

673
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,000
Well then, pray, continue.

674
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:45,000
We hunted
reindeer, mammoths--

675
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:46,998
Bison, horses,

676
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:48,534
The game retreated northward

677
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:49,732
As the climate changed,

678
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,868
You got the idea of growing food

679
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,666
Rather than gathering it,

680
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:55,834
Raising animals rather
than hunting them.

681
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:57,467
Am--Am I getting
warm, here?

682
00:26:57,502 --> 00:26:58,998
I bet I am.

683
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:01,501
Lakeside living becomes commonplace,

684
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,133
Fishing,
fowling-- Come on!

685
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:06,400
John, this is out of any textbook.

686
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:07,432
Even yours.

687
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:10,299
You got most of it right.

688
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,350
Eventually I headed to the east.

689
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:14,559
I'd grown curious about the world.

690
00:27:14,594 --> 00:27:17,164
I'd gotten the hang of going it alone,

691
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:19,734
Learning how to fit in when I wanted to.

692
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:21,599
East.

693
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:23,499
Towards the rising sun?

694
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:26,300
Yes. I thought it might be warmer there.

695
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:30,434
That's when I saw an ocean.

696
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,432
The Mediterranean, probably.

697
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:36,800
It was around the
beginning of the bronze age,

698
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:39,133
So I followed the trade
routes from the east,

699
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:40,365
Copper, tin,

700
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,533
Learning languages as I went.

701
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:46,632
Everywhere, creation myths,

702
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,400
New gods, so many, so different.

703
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:52,133
I finally realized that it was...

704
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:54,699
probably all hogwash,

705
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:57,299
So I was Sumerian for 2,000 years,

706
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:59,634
Then finally Babylonian under Hammurabi.

707
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:01,165
Great man.

708
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,732
And I sailed as a Phoenician for a time.

709
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,968
See, moving on had been
easier as a Hunter-Gatherer...

710
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:11,032
difficult when villages emerged,

711
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:14,501
Tougher still in city states
where authority was centralized.

712
00:28:14,536 --> 00:28:16,299
Strangers were suspect.

713
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:20,000
It seemed as though I
was always moving on.

714
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,998
I learned some
new tricks--

715
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,634
Even faked my death a couple of times.

716
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,968
I continued east

717
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:30,766
To India,

718
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:34,267
Luckily at the time of the Buddha.

719
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:35,467
Luckily.

720
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,934
Most extraordinary man I've ever known.

721
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,098
He taught me things

722
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,450
I'd never thought about before.

723
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:46,767
You studied... with the Buddha?

724
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:48,234
Until he died.

725
00:28:49,534 --> 00:28:52,501
He knew there was something
different about me.

726
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:54,951
I never told him.

727
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:57,332
This is fascinating.

728
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,632
I almost wish it were true.

729
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:03,400
Yeah, if it was true,
why are you telling us?

730
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:05,133
I mean, we might leave here today,

731
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:06,701
Go out there, tell everybody.

732
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:08,234
It would vanish in disbelief.

733
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:11,901
A story that goes around the room.

734
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:13,965
No credibility.

735
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,100
Even if I could make you believe me,

736
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:18,833
In a month, you wouldn't.

737
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:21,368
Some of you would call me a psychopath,

738
00:29:21,403 --> 00:29:23,868
Others would be angry
at a pointless joke.

739
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:25,902
Some of us are angry now.

740
00:29:25,937 --> 00:29:27,866
This--This
was a bad idea.

741
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:30,634
Uh, I love you all, and I do not want

742
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,001
To put you through anything.

743
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,299
Then why are you doing it?

744
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:35,634
'Cause I wanted
to say goodbye--

745
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:36,599
As yourself.

746
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:37,950
I think you've done that,

747
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,267
Whoever that self is.

748
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:40,499
Easy, Edith.

749
00:29:40,534 --> 00:29:42,165
We're just grading his homework.

750
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,000
I see what's going on. You're
playing the good cop, Dan.

751
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,332
That's fine. Just enjoy it.

752
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,033
All right, I think this
whole thing is just a crock!

753
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:50,766
I should leave, but I'm gonna stay.

754
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:53,501
You know why? 'Cause I wanna
see what this is all about.

755
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,032
So do I. What is this all about?

756
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:57,167
Let's ask Dr. Freud,
who's just arrived.

757
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:58,567
Hey, will! Will!

758
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:01,501
Art. Hey.

759
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,866
John!

760
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,365
I'm glad I caught you.

761
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,333
Someone mentioned
that you were leaving--

762
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:09,232
Called you, told you that I've lost it.

763
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:12,033
Glad you're here. Things are
going in unexpected directions.

764
00:30:12,068 --> 00:30:13,300
Yes, so I hear.

765
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:14,566
Hi.

766
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:16,184
Are you hungry?

767
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:17,732
Uh, thank you, no.

768
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,934
Whiskey? Johnny walker green.

769
00:30:19,969 --> 00:30:21,934
Oh, yes.

770
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:25,299
( Closes door )

771
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:27,934
You look very familiar,
my dear. Linda Murphy.

772
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:30,534
I'm in your Tuesday
psych 1 class, Dr. Gruber.

773
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:33,100
Ah, well, this lesson may be something

774
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:36,165
I could not have imagined.

775
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,532
I regret being so
obvious about this, John,

776
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:43,834
But these people are all
very concerned for you.

777
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:46,466
Yes, I'm cutting out paper dinosaurs.

778
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:49,667
I really wish I'd been
here from the beginning.

779
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:50,699
Me too.

780
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,732
Let me just say something right now.

781
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,100
There's absolutely no
way in the whole world

782
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:57,866
For John to prove this story to us,

783
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:00,868
Just like there's no way
for us to disprove it.

784
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:03,065
No matter how outrageous we think it is,

785
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,367
No matter how highly trained
some of us think we are,

786
00:31:06,402 --> 00:31:08,566
There's absolutely
no way to disprove it.

787
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:13,067
Our friend is either a
caveman, a liar, or a nut.

788
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:14,567
So while we're thinking about that,

789
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:17,234
Why don't we just go with it?

790
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:18,699
I mean, hell, who knows,

791
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:20,750
He might jolt us into believing him,

792
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:22,767
Or we might jolt him back to reality.

793
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:25,284
Believing? Whose reality?

794
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,767
So... you're a caveman.

795
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,065
Yes. Uh...

796
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,532
<i>uh, I was a Cro-magnon, I think.</i>

797
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,334
You don't know if
you're a caveman or not?

798
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:36,634
No, I'm sure about that.

799
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:37,766
A Cro-magnon, then.

800
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,899
When did you first realize this?

801
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:42,133
When the Cro-magnon
was first identified,

802
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:44,234
When anthropology gave them a name,

803
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,732
I had mine.

804
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:47,165
Well, please continue.

805
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,133
I'm sure you must have more to say.

806
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:51,067
Would you like me to lie on the couch?

807
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:53,667
( Laughs ) as you wish.

808
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:58,132
As a physician, I'm curious.

809
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:01,501
In this enormous lifetime you describe,

810
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,351
Have you ever been ill?

811
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:05,167
Sure, as much as anyone.

812
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:06,734
Seriously ill?

813
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:08,232
Sometimes.

814
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:10,199
Of what? Do you know?

815
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:11,800
In prehistory, I can't tell you.

816
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:13,367
Maybe pneumonia once or twice.

817
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,265
Last few hundred years,

818
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,467
I've gotten over typhoid, yellow fever,

819
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:23,634
Smallpox...I survived the black plague.

820
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:24,933
Bubonic?

821
00:32:24,968 --> 00:32:26,332
Oh, that's terrible.

822
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,065
More so than history describes.

823
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,634
And smallpox-- But
you're not scarred.

824
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:32,833
I don't scar.

825
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,234
No, John, that is not possible.

826
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:35,566
Please, let's take John's story

827
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:38,717
At face value and explore
it from that perspective.

828
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:41,834
If he doesn't scar, it's
no stranger than the rest.

829
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:44,300
John, would you please stop by my lab,

830
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:46,132
Suffer a few tests from

831
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,000
Your friendly neighborhood biologist.

832
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:49,332
I'm leery of labs.

833
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,683
Afraid I might go in and
stay for a thousand years

834
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:54,000
While cigarette smoking
men try to figure me out.

835
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:55,868
You don't think that I would betray you?

836
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:57,332
Walls have ears.

837
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:59,868
Medical tests might be a
way of proving what you say.

838
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:01,085
I don't wanna prove it.

839
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,260
So you're telling us this,

840
00:33:02,295 --> 00:33:03,365
The yarn of the century,

841
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,134
And you don't care if
we believe it or not?

842
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:06,835
I guess I shouldn't
have expected you to.

843
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,501
You're not as crazy as you think I am.

844
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:09,466
Amen.

845
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,967
I've always liked you.

846
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:12,418
Why, thank you, dear.

847
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:13,799
Now that's changing.

848
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,332
Surely you don't believe this nonsense.

849
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,400
I think we should remain
courteous to someone

850
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:19,032
Who we've known and trusted, Edith.

851
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,767
Here you sit--You
can't break his story.

852
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:24,467
All you can do is thumb your nose at it.

853
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,501
Is that what you're doing, John?

854
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:28,185
Are you laughing at us inside?

855
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,799
I wish you didn't feel that way.

856
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:33,200
What you're saying--
It offends common sense.

857
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:35,033
So does relativity,
quantum mechanics--

858
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:36,699
That's the way nature works.

859
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:41,133
But your story doesn't fit
into nature as we know it.

860
00:33:41,168 --> 00:33:42,868
But we know so little, Dan.

861
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,167
We know so little.

862
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:46,365
How many of you know

863
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,684
Five geniuses in your field

864
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:48,933
That you disagree with...

865
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:50,567
one you would like to strangle?

866
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:52,732
Strangle them all.

867
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,400
It's bad enough we have to listen

868
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:55,668
To Harry's idiotic jokes.

869
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:56,866
Thank you very much, Edith.

870
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,300
Maybe when I'm 110, I'll
be as smart as you are.

871
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:00,767
If you lived as long as John did,

872
00:34:00,802 --> 00:34:02,451
You still wouldn't grow up.

873
00:34:02,486 --> 00:34:04,065
Come on, guys. Take it easy.

874
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,567
How often do we get to meet someone

875
00:34:06,602 --> 00:34:10,033
Who says he's a stone age man?

876
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:11,300
Well, once is enough.

877
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:12,699
Edith.

878
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:14,834
All right. A guy
with your mind--

879
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:16,899
You'd have studied a great deal.

880
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:20,367
I have ten degrees,
including all of yours...

881
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:22,766
except yours, will.

882
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:24,968
That makes me feel a trifle lilliputian.

883
00:34:25,003 --> 00:34:27,332
That's over the span of 170 years.

884
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:30,601
I got my biology degree
at oxford in 1840,

885
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,334
So I'm a little behind the times.

886
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:33,632
The same in
other areas--

887
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,434
I can't keep up with the
new stuff that comes along.

888
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,399
No one can.

889
00:34:37,434 --> 00:34:38,734
Not even in their specialty.

890
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:40,299
So much for the myth

891
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:42,067
Of the super-wise,
all-knowing immortal.

892
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:43,965
I see your point, John.

893
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,632
No matter how long a man lives,

894
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,766
He can't be in advance of his times.

895
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:50,801
He can't know more than
the best of the race knows,

896
00:34:50,836 --> 00:34:53,801
If that--I mean, when the
world learned it was round,

897
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:55,151
You learned it.

898
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:56,510
It took some time.

899
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:57,799
News traveled slowly

900
00:34:57,834 --> 00:34:59,734
Before communications were fancy.

901
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:02,365
There were social obstacles,

902
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,601
Preconceptions, screams from the church.

903
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:06,766
Ten doctorates.

904
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:08,667
That's impressive,
John. Did you teach them?

905
00:35:08,702 --> 00:35:10,032
Some.

906
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,666
You might have all done the same.

907
00:35:12,701 --> 00:35:15,834
Living 14,000 years
didn't make me a genius.

908
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:17,167
I just had time.

909
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:18,799
Time.

910
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:20,799
We can't see it, we can't hear it,

911
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:24,534
We can't weigh it, we can't
measure it in a laboratory.

912
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:26,799
It's a subjective sense of becoming

913
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:31,300
What we are instead of what
we were a nanosecond ago,

914
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:33,734
Becoming what we will
be in another nanosecond.

915
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,768
The Hopis see time as a landscape,

916
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:38,252
Existing before and behind us,

917
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:40,701
And we move-- We
move through it,

918
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,499
Slice by slice.

919
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:43,799
Clocks measure time.

920
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,199
No, they measure themselves.

921
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:47,599
The objective referent
of clock is another clock.

922
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:50,033
How very interesting. What
has it got to do with John?

923
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:52,065
Oh, he--He
might be a man

924
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:57,133
Who lives outside of time as we know it.

925
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:02,132
Yes, uh, well.

926
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:05,283
People do go around armed these days.

927
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:08,400
If I shot you, John--
You're immortal?

928
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:10,365
Would you survive this?

929
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,167
I never said I was immortal, just old.

930
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:14,365
I might die.

931
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,799
And then you could wonder

932
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:18,200
The rest of your incarcerated
life what you shot.

933
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:22,667
Well, uh, may I?

934
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,299
( Sighs )

935
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:25,998
Preferable to a gun.

936
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:29,300
Will, that was a bit much.

937
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:31,951
Ooh. Books.

938
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:34,532
Doctorates.

939
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,783
Yes, you have grown and changed.

940
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:40,209
But there is always innate nature.

941
00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:42,601
Wouldn't you be more comfortable

942
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:44,234
Squatting in the backyard?

943
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,751
Sometimes I do, will.

944
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,234
Look up at the stars.

945
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:48,265
Wonder.

946
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,701
And what did primitive man make of them?

947
00:36:50,736 --> 00:36:52,632
A great mystery.

948
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:55,065
There were gods up there then.

949
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,601
Shamans who knew about them told us.

950
00:36:57,636 --> 00:36:58,868
They still do.

951
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:02,334
Have you ever wished it would end?

952
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:05,933
No.

953
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:08,332
Fourteen thousand years.

954
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:11,017
Injuries, illness, disasters.

955
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:13,376
You've survived them all.

956
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:15,701
You're a very lucky man.

957
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:20,984
( Knocks )

958
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:22,234
Come in.

959
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,300
John Oldman?

960
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:27,666
Yes.

961
00:37:27,701 --> 00:37:29,601
Charity now. We're here
to pick up the furniture.

962
00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:31,399
It's all yours.

963
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:32,666
Here, take this chair.

964
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,667
I'm gonna go drink in the corner.

965
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:39,234
You're, uh... you're donating it?

966
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:40,468
Everything?

967
00:37:40,503 --> 00:37:41,632
I'll get more.

968
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,200
Do you always travel this light?

969
00:37:43,235 --> 00:37:45,334
It's the only way to move.

970
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:48,899
Oh, you--

971
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,466
You've talked a good deal

972
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,734
About your extraordinary
amount of living.

973
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,934
What do you think of dying, John?

974
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,567
Do you fear death?

975
00:37:57,602 --> 00:37:58,866
Who wouldn't?

976
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,034
How did primitive man regard death?

977
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:03,167
Well, we had the practical concept.

978
00:38:03,202 --> 00:38:05,134
You know, we stopped,

979
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:07,032
Fell down, didn't get up,

980
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,267
Started to smell bad, come apart.

981
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:11,432
Injuries we
could understand--

982
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:14,033
If someone's insides
were all over the ground.

983
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:15,365
Infections...

984
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,868
they were, uh, mysterious.

985
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,432
Aging...

986
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,998
the biggest mystery of all.

987
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:26,032
You realized you were different.

988
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:29,133
<i>Longer to realize how I was different,</i>

989
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:30,965
To find a way to synthesize

990
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,516
My experience into a view of myself.

991
00:38:33,551 --> 00:38:36,033
At first, I thought everybody had

992
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:37,799
Something wrong with them.

993
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:41,434
They got old and they
died, animals, too...

994
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:42,499
but not me.

995
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:45,417
( Coughs pointedly )

996
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:48,300
Oh, forgive me, my dear.

997
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:49,965
You live simply.

998
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,501
I've owned castles, but why leave a lot

999
00:38:52,536 --> 00:38:53,801
If you're always leaving?

1000
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:55,032
I have money.

1001
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,801
What, you get into
at&t at 50 cents, John?

1002
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:01,732
As one grows older,

1003
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:07,100
The days, weeks, months
go by more quickly.

1004
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:10,201
What does a day or a year

1005
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:12,818
Or a century mean to you?

1006
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:15,400
The birth-death cycle?

1007
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:17,051
Turbulence.

1008
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:18,632
I meet someone,

1009
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,501
Learn their name, say
a word, they're gone.

1010
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:25,934
Others come like waves. Rise, fall.

1011
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:29,901
Ripples in a wheat
field, blown by the wind.

1012
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:32,634
Do you ever get tired of it all?

1013
00:39:32,669 --> 00:39:34,065
I get bored now and then.

1014
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,367
They keep making the same
stupid mistakes over and over.

1015
00:39:37,402 --> 00:39:38,300
Hey.

1016
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:40,599
Then you see yourself

1017
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:42,834
As separate from the rest of humanity.

1018
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:45,634
I didn't mean it that way.

1019
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:48,100
But of course...

1020
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:50,265
I am.

1021
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,632
( Chuckles )

1022
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:54,499
Are you comfortable
knowing that you have lived

1023
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:58,400
While everyone you knew--
Everyone you knew, John!--

1024
00:39:58,435 --> 00:39:59,566
Has died?

1025
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:01,367
I've regretted losing people...

1026
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:02,399
often.

1027
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,834
Have you ever felt
guilt about that--

1028
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,118
Something akin to survivor's guilt?

1029
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:09,367
In the strict psychological sense?

1030
00:40:09,402 --> 00:40:10,734
I suppose I have.

1031
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:11,868
Yeah.

1032
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:15,434
But what can I do about it?

1033
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:18,934
Indeed.

1034
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,267
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1035
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:22,466
Gentlemen,
I'm--

1036
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:24,434
I'm gonna keep the couch.

1037
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:25,399
Thanks.

1038
00:40:25,434 --> 00:40:27,599
Ladies? Will? Oh, no...

1039
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,267
you've got a heart condition.
Don't grump about it.

1040
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,067
Hey, how about changing
the subject, will?

1041
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:33,866
Enough with the--
With the dying.

1042
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:37,601
But this is the flip
side of his coin, Harry.

1043
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:40,399
I'm very curious to know his feelings.

1044
00:40:40,434 --> 00:40:43,334
Would you prefer I asked
him about his father?

1045
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:44,767
I thought you always started with

1046
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:46,132
"Tell me about your mother."

1047
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:49,200
Yes, but prehistory was
strongly patriarchal.

1048
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:52,351
Surely you remember your father.

1049
00:40:52,386 --> 00:40:55,432
I seem to remember a figure,

1050
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:58,400
Perhaps an older brother,
a social father, maybe.

1051
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:00,098
Well, no matter.

1052
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:02,501
I can scarcely remember mine.

1053
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,532
Do you feel a vacancy

1054
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,584
In your life about that, John,

1055
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:10,601
Something you wish could be filled

1056
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:13,501
By a face, a voice, an image?

1057
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:17,365
Not at this late date.

1058
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,701
There must be someone--
Probably many--

1059
00:41:19,736 --> 00:41:21,434
That you valued intensely.

1060
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:22,833
Loved.

1061
00:41:22,868 --> 00:41:26,368
You saw them
age and die--

1062
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:29,833
A friend, a colleague, a wife.

1063
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:33,167
Certainly you've had wives and children?

1064
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:34,566
I'd move on.

1065
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:36,399
I had to move on.

1066
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:39,133
Making him history's biggest bigamist.

1067
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:40,199
( Chuckles softly )

1068
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:42,901
Have you ever in your life thought

1069
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:44,534
"It should have been me"?

1070
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:47,866
Maybe.

1071
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:49,365
Yeah, Art has told me

1072
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,165
That some of your early fellows

1073
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,883
Feared you were stealing their lives.

1074
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:56,567
Have you thought that perhaps you were?

1075
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:58,032
Perhaps you are!

1076
00:41:58,067 --> 00:42:01,267
There have always been
legends of such a thing,

1077
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:03,332
A creature not quite human

1078
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:07,434
Taking not the blood,
but the life force itself?

1079
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:08,732
My god, will.

1080
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,199
Unconsciously, perhaps,

1081
00:42:11,234 --> 00:42:15,234
By some biological or psychic mechanism

1082
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:17,232
That we can only guess at.

1083
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:20,267
I'm not saying you would do
such a thing deliberately.

1084
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:23,334
I'm not saying that you
would even know how to...

1085
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:24,667
would you?

1086
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,100
But would such a thing be fair?

1087
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:30,766
So you believe me now?

1088
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:34,132
I'm only exploring what you have said.

1089
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:38,067
Whether I believe it or
not is of no importance.

1090
00:42:38,102 --> 00:42:39,884
We will die...

1091
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:41,632
you will live.

1092
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,801
Will you come to my funeral, John?

1093
00:42:43,836 --> 00:42:45,065
Hey, will...

1094
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,299
you've gone too far.

1095
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:49,000
John didn't ask to be what he is.

1096
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:51,667
And we did not ask to hear about it.

1097
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,199
But if it were true,

1098
00:42:53,234 --> 00:42:56,300
Is there one among us
who would not feel envy,

1099
00:42:56,335 --> 00:42:58,801
Even perhaps a touch of hatred?

1100
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:02,517
You told us of yourself, John.

1101
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:04,309
Can you imagine how we feel?

1102
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:06,505
I never thought of that.

1103
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,632
Since you may not die,

1104
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:11,432
While we most assuredly will...

1105
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:13,634
there must be a reason for that, no?

1106
00:43:13,669 --> 00:43:15,501
Perhaps you are an expert.

1107
00:43:16,901 --> 00:43:19,434
Uh, that's it, Mr.
Oldman. Have a good one.

1108
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,167
Thank you. You too.

1109
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:27,000
Or are you a vampire, John?

1110
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:29,767
Even an unknowing one.

1111
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:32,499
Do you stand alive and tall

1112
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:34,667
In a graveyard that you helped to fill?

1113
00:43:34,702 --> 00:43:36,165
That's going too far.

1114
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,100
Bored, perhaps lonely,
because your heart

1115
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,151
Cannot keep its treasures.

1116
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:43,167
Is that what you're doing?

1117
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:46,534
Have you led a wrongful life?

1118
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:49,634
Well, then, perhaps...

1119
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:52,567
it is time to die.

1120
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:55,566
Wait a minute, now.

1121
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:57,566
Look, I don't know what John is doing,

1122
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:00,032
But I sure as hell don't
like what you're doing.

1123
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:02,501
Give me that gun or I'm
gonna break your goddamn arm.

1124
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:05,834
You sound like our football coach, Dan.

1125
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,801
What do you think, John?

1126
00:44:07,836 --> 00:44:09,766
A shot to the arm?

1127
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:12,701
Perhaps we could watch it heal.

1128
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:14,884
A bullet in
the head--

1129
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:17,033
What exactly will happen?

1130
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,165
I have papers to correct.

1131
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,917
As much as I dislike that job,

1132
00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:30,634
It'll be preferable to this.

1133
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:34,300
I leave you with it.

1134
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:38,933
Jesus Christ.

1135
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,901
What the hell was that all about?

1136
00:44:40,936 --> 00:44:42,199
Where'd he get a gun?

1137
00:44:42,234 --> 00:44:43,817
He had you on the ropes, John.

1138
00:44:43,852 --> 00:44:45,400
Are you really so damn smart?

1139
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:46,767
It's not like will.

1140
00:44:48,634 --> 00:44:50,467
Mary passed away yesterday.

1141
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:54,199
Who?

1142
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,634
His wife.

1143
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,834
She had, uh, pancreatic cancer.

1144
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:02,801
Will!

1145
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:06,132
I didn't know about Mary.

1146
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:09,567
I'm sorry. I can see how
this might have hit you.

1147
00:45:09,602 --> 00:45:13,501
Please, permit me to
be infantile by myself.

1148
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:15,834
Will, please.

1149
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:28,634
( Starts car )

1150
00:45:32,434 --> 00:45:34,283
What the hell were you thinking, Art?

1151
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,133
Oh, come on. Something had to be done.

1152
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:37,551
I have to say I agree.

1153
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:38,899
And he's our friend.

1154
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:41,167
Whatever else on earth is going on,

1155
00:45:41,202 --> 00:45:42,268
He's our friend!

1156
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:43,299
You sure about that?

1157
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:44,899
Why are you being so hard on him?

1158
00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:47,634
One of my favorite
people has disappeared.

1159
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:51,001
Can you get Alzheimer's at 35?

1160
00:45:51,036 --> 00:45:54,334
Maybe I'm trying to wake him up.

1161
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:57,968
Maybe I'm too sad to cry.

1162
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:05,234
What I said about myself hurt him.

1163
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:07,632
He struck
back expertly--

1164
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:10,433
That stuff about stealing life forces?

1165
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:13,200
I've always wondered about the reasons.

1166
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:22,868
Well, we still have an
afternoon to kill, right?

1167
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,767
Charades?

1168
00:46:28,968 --> 00:46:31,165
No. John?

1169
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,868
I have a charade, and
it is just for you.

1170
00:46:33,903 --> 00:46:34,899
Sandy, come here.

1171
00:46:34,934 --> 00:46:36,584
Come on, come on, come on.

1172
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:38,234
Okay, this one's for you.

1173
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:40,199
Ready?

1174
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:42,434
( Grunts like ape )

1175
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,734
( Wolf whistles )

1176
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:47,868
( Grunting )

1177
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,717
Ooh!

1178
00:46:52,752 --> 00:46:54,199
Uhn.

1179
00:46:54,234 --> 00:46:55,850
My first wedding?

1180
00:46:55,885 --> 00:46:57,393
There you go.

1181
00:46:57,428 --> 00:46:58,866
There you go!

1182
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:01,601
Very good, and I bet at least one of us

1183
00:47:01,636 --> 00:47:02,766
Is your direct descendent.

1184
00:47:02,801 --> 00:47:04,867
And I didn't even send a Christmas card.

1185
00:47:04,902 --> 00:47:07,068
Christmas card? What
about a birthday card?

1186
00:47:07,103 --> 00:47:09,234
And don't even get me
started on the candles...

1187
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:11,234
with the blowing and the ( huffs )

1188
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:13,133
For years with the blowing.

1189
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,132
Yeah, all right. I tried.

1190
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,434
Well, uh, call me underdeveloped,

1191
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:22,801
But I'd like to hear more.

1192
00:47:25,033 --> 00:47:26,350
Me too.

1193
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,632
More.

1194
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:30,033
You double-damn swear
this isn't some cockamamie

1195
00:47:30,068 --> 00:47:32,234
Science fiction story or...

1196
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:33,601
you're pulling on us?

1197
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:36,098
Next question.

1198
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:37,467
You--You--You
realize

1199
00:47:37,502 --> 00:47:38,766
This is an invitation

1200
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:40,968
To men in white suits with happy pills.

1201
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:41,998
Think about it--

1202
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:43,868
A mechanism allowing survival

1203
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:45,232
For thousands of years?

1204
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:47,499
Run out of room even faster.

1205
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,801
Then we'd have to go to mars as a colony

1206
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:51,701
As we expanded, as we'd have to.

1207
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:53,632
I'd like that.

1208
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:55,634
On a planet of another star.

1209
00:47:55,669 --> 00:47:57,499
I envy you.

1210
00:47:57,534 --> 00:47:59,866
Did you have a pet dinosaur?

1211
00:47:59,901 --> 00:48:02,267
They were a little bit before my time.

1212
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:03,499
At least something is.

1213
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:06,601
No doubt you could give us
a thousand details, John,

1214
00:48:06,636 --> 00:48:07,666
Corroborating your story,

1215
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:10,167
From the Magdalene to the Buddha to now.

1216
00:48:10,202 --> 00:48:11,332
Ten thousand,

1217
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:12,968
And you could stay out of the books.

1218
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:15,432
Oh, it's getting chilly.

1219
00:48:15,467 --> 00:48:17,667
Here, come over here. Join me.

1220
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:23,667
That, uh, raises an
interesting question, John.

1221
00:48:23,702 --> 00:48:25,165
Could there be others like you

1222
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,400
Who escaped the aging
process as you have?

1223
00:48:27,435 --> 00:48:28,784
Representing something terrific

1224
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:30,133
We don't even know about biology.

1225
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:31,401
We're learning all the time.

1226
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:32,599
Yeah, but how would he know?

1227
00:48:32,634 --> 00:48:35,667
He doesn't wear an I.D. Badge
saying "yabba dabba doo."

1228
00:48:35,702 --> 00:48:38,318
There was a man in the 1600s.

1229
00:48:38,353 --> 00:48:40,899
Where were you in 1292 a.D.?

1230
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:43,534
Where were you a year ago on this date?

1231
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,968
Anyway, it was the
1600s, and I met a man,

1232
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:51,701
And I had a hunch that he was...

1233
00:48:51,736 --> 00:48:53,632
like me, so I told him.

1234
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:57,434
Ah. See, you said this was a first.

1235
00:48:57,469 --> 00:48:58,432
I forgot.

1236
00:48:58,467 --> 00:49:00,334
A crack in your story, John?

1237
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:02,368
A touch of senility.

1238
00:49:02,403 --> 00:49:04,332
Anyway, he said yes,

1239
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:06,367
But from another time, another place.

1240
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:07,899
We talked for two days.

1241
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:09,901
It was all pretty convincing,

1242
00:49:09,936 --> 00:49:12,165
But we couldn't be sure.

1243
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,467
We each confirmed what the other said,

1244
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:16,734
But how do we know if the confirmation

1245
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:18,534
Was genuine or an echo?

1246
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:20,265
I knew I was kosher,

1247
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,200
But I thought, "maybe
he's playing a game on me."

1248
00:49:24,235 --> 00:49:27,599
You know, a scholar
of all we spoke about.

1249
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:30,667
He said he was inclined
with the same reservation.

1250
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:31,899
Now, that's interesting.

1251
00:49:31,934 --> 00:49:34,100
Just as we can never be sure,

1252
00:49:34,135 --> 00:49:35,684
Even if we
wanted to--

1253
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:37,199
I mean, if we were sure,

1254
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:38,899
You couldn't be sure of that.

1255
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,033
We parted, agreeing
to keep in touch--

1256
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:42,466
Of course,
we didn't--

1257
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,968
And 200 years later I thought I saw him

1258
00:49:45,003 --> 00:49:47,234
In a train station in Brussels.

1259
00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:48,801
Lost him in the crowd.

1260
00:49:48,836 --> 00:49:50,965
Oh, what a shame.

1261
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,800
I--I mean, if
it were true.

1262
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:54,566
Okay, here's one for you.

1263
00:49:54,601 --> 00:49:56,901
What do you do in your spare time?

1264
00:49:56,936 --> 00:49:58,032
( Laughs )

1265
00:49:58,067 --> 00:49:59,165
Every 50 years or so,

1266
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,065
When I wanna get away from the rush,

1267
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,133
I go down to a primitive
tribe in new guinea

1268
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:05,868
Where I'm worshipped as an immortal god,

1269
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:08,267
And they have a huge statue of me.

1270
00:50:08,302 --> 00:50:09,466
It's a big party.

1271
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:11,532
Yeah, I've got a lot of pictures of it,

1272
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:13,399
But I've already packed
them up. I'm sorry.

1273
00:50:13,434 --> 00:50:17,167
I won't make the obvious nasty
crack about more unwashed cavemen.

1274
00:50:17,202 --> 00:50:18,532
Actually, bathing was the style

1275
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:20,434
Until the middle ages
when the church told us

1276
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:23,300
It was sinful to wash away god's dirt,

1277
00:50:23,335 --> 00:50:24,532
So people were sewn

1278
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:26,217
Into their underwear in October

1279
00:50:26,252 --> 00:50:27,959
And they popped out in April.

1280
00:50:27,994 --> 00:50:29,667
You said you just happened.

1281
00:50:29,702 --> 00:50:31,534
I don't believe that.

1282
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:33,332
If your story's true,

1283
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:36,283
Why did god allow you to happen?

1284
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:39,200
That makes an interesting point.

1285
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:40,866
Are you religious, John?

1286
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:43,434
I don't follow a known religion. No.

1287
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:44,499
Ever.

1288
00:50:44,534 --> 00:50:46,817
Long time ago I did,

1289
00:50:46,852 --> 00:50:49,065
Like most people.

1290
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,901
Some just never get over it.

1291
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:52,300
Do you believe in god?

1292
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,165
As Laplace said,

1293
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,834
"I have no need of that hypothesis."

1294
00:50:57,869 --> 00:50:59,365
He may be around, though.

1295
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,050
He's everywhere. We just can't see him.

1296
00:51:02,085 --> 00:51:04,701
Pfft. If this was the best I could do,

1297
00:51:04,736 --> 00:51:06,251
I'd be hiding, too.

1298
00:51:06,286 --> 00:51:07,732
And creation...

1299
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:10,100
it's here--I'm not so
sure it was created.

1300
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:11,432
What then?

1301
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:15,033
Maybe it's just accumulated,
fields affecting fields.

1302
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:17,701
What about the source
of the field energies?

1303
00:51:17,736 --> 00:51:19,666
Wouldn't that imply a prime mover?

1304
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,799
I'd wonder about the
source of the prime mover,

1305
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:25,033
Infinite regress, but that
doesn't imply anything to me.

1306
00:51:25,068 --> 00:51:26,799
Back to the mystery.

1307
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,866
It's a very old question,

1308
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:32,767
But there's no answer
except in religious terms.

1309
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:35,499
If you have faith, it's answered.

1310
00:51:35,534 --> 00:51:38,968
Did you ever meet any person
from our religious history?

1311
00:51:39,003 --> 00:51:41,033
A biblical figure?

1312
00:51:41,068 --> 00:51:42,367
In a way.

1313
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:44,065
Who?

1314
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,566
We should skip this one.

1315
00:51:45,601 --> 00:51:47,300
No, no, no skipping. Come on.

1316
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:48,551
Next question.

1317
00:51:48,586 --> 00:51:49,960
No, come on!

1318
00:51:49,995 --> 00:51:51,299
( Clamoring )

1319
00:51:51,334 --> 00:51:52,599
Come on, spit it out!

1320
00:51:52,634 --> 00:51:54,265
Good lord! You were one of them!

1321
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,934
This is going in a direction
that I--I didn't expect.

1322
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:01,151
I hoped it wouldn't--
We...call it a night.

1323
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:04,334
Come on! You were someone
in religious history?

1324
00:52:04,369 --> 00:52:05,566
Yes.

1325
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:07,133
In the bible?

1326
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:08,098
Yes.

1327
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,165
Someone we know?

1328
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,234
How could we not know
someone in the bible?

1329
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:12,701
I mean somebody important.

1330
00:52:12,736 --> 00:52:14,133
You may think you know him,

1331
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:15,666
But it's mostly myth.

1332
00:52:15,701 --> 00:52:19,050
The entire bible is
mostly myth and allegory

1333
00:52:19,085 --> 00:52:22,400
With maybe some basis
in historical events.

1334
00:52:22,435 --> 00:52:26,734
You were part of that history?

1335
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:27,834
Yes.

1336
00:52:28,968 --> 00:52:30,199
Moses.

1337
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:34,067
Moses was based on Misis, a Syrian myth,

1338
00:52:34,102 --> 00:52:35,634
And there are
earlier versions--

1339
00:52:35,669 --> 00:52:37,732
All found floating on water,

1340
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:40,300
The staff that changed to a snake,

1341
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:42,834
Waters that were parted so followers

1342
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,401
Could be led to freedom

1343
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:45,899
And even receive laws

1344
00:52:45,934 --> 00:52:47,501
On stone or wooden tablets.

1345
00:52:47,536 --> 00:52:50,399
One of the apostles.

1346
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,850
They weren't really apostles.

1347
00:52:52,885 --> 00:52:55,232
They didn't do any real teaching.

1348
00:52:55,267 --> 00:52:58,567
Peter the fisherman learned
a little more about fishing.

1349
00:52:58,602 --> 00:53:00,601
How do you know that?

1350
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:06,000
The mythical overlay is so enormous...

1351
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,432
and not good.

1352
00:53:09,467 --> 00:53:15,632
The truth is so, so simple.

1353
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:19,367
The new testament in 100
words or less. You ready?

1354
00:53:19,402 --> 00:53:20,968
I don't think I wanna hear this.

1355
00:53:21,003 --> 00:53:22,499
Harry, will you take me home?

1356
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:24,650
No, not right now. I
do want to hear this.

1357
00:53:24,685 --> 00:53:26,767
Sit down, Edith. You
act like you believe him.

1358
00:53:26,802 --> 00:53:28,165
It's sacrilege.

1359
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,383
How can it be sacrilege?

1360
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:30,532
He hasn't said anything yet.

1361
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:33,184
The new new testament is sacrilege.

1362
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:35,766
There are a dozen new new testaments,

1363
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:38,934
From Hebrew to Greek
to Latin to Tyndale,

1364
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:40,767
All the way to king James,

1365
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:42,098
All revisionist,

1366
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:44,365
And all called revealed truth.

1367
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,566
I mean a new new testament in 100 words.

1368
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:49,901
I can give you the ten
commandments in ten words.

1369
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,466
Don't. Don't, don't, don't,

1370
00:53:51,501 --> 00:53:53,300
Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

1371
00:53:53,335 --> 00:53:54,899
( Laughs ) Don't.

1372
00:53:54,934 --> 00:53:58,000
The commandments are just modern
updates of more ancient laws.

1373
00:53:58,035 --> 00:53:59,833
Hammurabi's code.

1374
00:53:59,868 --> 00:54:02,367
That's right, they
weren't the first, right?

1375
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:05,334
Edith, I was raised on the Torah...

1376
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:06,799
my wife, on the Koran.

1377
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:08,467
My oldest son is an atheist.

1378
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:10,317
My youngest is a scientologist.

1379
00:54:10,352 --> 00:54:12,098
My daughter is studying Hinduism.

1380
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:16,367
I imagine that there is room there
for a holy war in my living room,

1381
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:18,567
But we practice live and let live.

1382
00:54:19,901 --> 00:54:21,334
Why don't you sit down.

1383
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:31,367
What is your preferred
version of the bible?

1384
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:32,833
The King James, of course.

1385
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:35,334
It's the most modern, the
work of great scholars.

1386
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:36,834
Modern is good.

1387
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:40,868
All right, John, hit
us with the short form.

1388
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:44,934
Guy met the Buddha, liked what he heard,

1389
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:46,768
Thought about
it for a while--

1390
00:54:46,803 --> 00:54:48,567
Say 500 years, while he returned

1391
00:54:48,602 --> 00:54:50,568
To the Mediterranean,

1392
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:52,499
Became an Etruscan.

1393
00:54:52,534 --> 00:54:54,132
Seeped into the roman empire.

1394
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,968
He didn't like
what they became--

1395
00:54:56,003 --> 00:54:58,199
A giant killing machine.

1396
00:54:58,234 --> 00:54:59,933
He went to the near east thinking,

1397
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:03,234
"Why not pass the Buddha's
teachings on in a modern form."

1398
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:05,466
So he tried.

1399
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:07,667
One dissident against Rome?

1400
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:08,833
Rome won.

1401
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:10,232
The rest is history.

1402
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:12,734
Well, sort of. Lot of
fairy tales mixed in.

1403
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:17,532
I knew it.

1404
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:19,500
He's saying he was Christ.

1405
00:55:19,535 --> 00:55:21,399
Oh, no. That's the medal

1406
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:23,767
They pinned on Jesus
to fulfill prophecy.

1407
00:55:23,802 --> 00:55:24,965
The crucifixion.

1408
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
He blocked the pain
as he had learned to do

1409
00:55:28,035 --> 00:55:29,365
In Tibet and India.

1410
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,766
He also learned to
slow his body processes

1411
00:55:31,801 --> 00:55:34,400
Down to the point where
they were undetectable.

1412
00:55:34,435 --> 00:55:35,834
They thought he was dead.

1413
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:37,199
So his followers pulled him

1414
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:39,532
From the cross, placed him in a cave...

1415
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:42,200
his body normalized as
he had trained it to...

1416
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:45,933
he attempted to go away undetected,

1417
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:48,400
But some devotees were standing watch.

1418
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:52,284
Tried to explain.

1419
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,699
They were ecstatic.

1420
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:57,199
Thus, I was resurrected,

1421
00:55:57,234 --> 00:55:59,250
And I ascended to central Europe

1422
00:55:59,285 --> 00:56:01,232
To get away as far as possible.

1423
00:56:01,267 --> 00:56:03,734
You don't mean a word of this, John.

1424
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:05,734
My god, why are you doing this?

1425
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:07,300
Let me see your wrists.

1426
00:56:07,335 --> 00:56:08,766
I don't scar.

1427
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:10,432
Besides, they tied me...

1428
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:13,634
but nails and blood make
better religious Art.

1429
00:56:13,669 --> 00:56:16,801
( Laughs ) all the
speculations about Jesus.

1430
00:56:16,836 --> 00:56:18,566
He was black, he was Asian,

1431
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:21,084
He was a blue-eyed
Aryan with a golden beard

1432
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,532
And hair straight out
of Vidal Sassoon's,

1433
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:26,734
He was a benevolent alien,
he never existed at all.

1434
00:56:26,769 --> 00:56:28,866
Now he's a caveman.

1435
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:32,000
The Christ figure goes all
the way back to Krishna--

1436
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:33,067
Hercules, of course.

1437
00:56:33,102 --> 00:56:34,098
Hercules?

1438
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:36,800
Born of a virgin, Alcmene.

1439
00:56:36,835 --> 00:56:39,467
A god for a father, Zeus.

1440
00:56:39,502 --> 00:56:42,098
The only begotten.

1441
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:44,699
<i>The savior--
The Greek? Soter.</i>

1442
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,866
The good shepherd, the prince of peace,

1443
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:49,434
Bringing gentle persuasion
and divine wisdom.

1444
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:52,268
He died, joined his father on Olympus

1445
00:56:52,303 --> 00:56:55,032
A thousand years before Gethsemane.

1446
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:58,934
How can you compare pagan
mythology to the true word?

1447
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:01,501
Pretty damn closely, I'd say.

1448
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:03,998
The early Christian leaders,

1449
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:05,933
They threw away Hebrew manuscripts

1450
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:08,868
And borrowed from pagan
sources all over the place.

1451
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:11,499
Do you realize how...

1452
00:57:11,534 --> 00:57:13,766
inconsiderately you're
treating my feelings?

1453
00:57:13,801 --> 00:57:17,300
About as inconsiderately
as we're treating John's.

1454
00:57:17,335 --> 00:57:19,566
Well, he doesn't
believe what he's saying!

1455
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:22,167
Do you believe literally
everything in the bible, Edith?

1456
00:57:22,202 --> 00:57:23,299
Yes!

1457
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:24,699
Before you say it,

1458
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:27,400
I know it's undergone a lot of changes,

1459
00:57:27,435 --> 00:57:29,901
But god has spoken through man

1460
00:57:29,936 --> 00:57:31,933
To make his word clearer.

1461
00:57:31,968 --> 00:57:34,365
He couldn't get it right the first time?

1462
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,600
We're imperfect! He had to
work to make us understand.

1463
00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:40,618
<i>He couldn't get us right
the first time, Edith?</i>

1464
00:57:40,653 --> 00:57:43,601
Taken alone, the
philosophical teachings of Jesus

1465
00:57:43,636 --> 00:57:46,585
Are Buddhism with
a Hebrew accent--

1466
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,534
Kindness, tolerance, brotherhood, love,

1467
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:51,232
A ruthless realism acknowledging

1468
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:54,501
That life is as it is here
on earth, here and now.

1469
00:57:54,536 --> 00:57:57,635
The kingdom of god, meaning goodness,

1470
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:00,734
Is right here, where it should be.

1471
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,833
"I am what I am becoming."

1472
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:04,434
That's what the Buddha brought in.

1473
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:05,833
And that's what I taught.

1474
00:58:05,868 --> 00:58:08,834
But a talking snake
make a lady eat an apple,

1475
00:58:08,869 --> 00:58:09,965
So we're screwed.

1476
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,532
Heaven and hell were peddled

1477
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:14,817
So priests could rule
through seduction and terror,

1478
00:58:14,852 --> 00:58:18,067
Save our souls that we never
lost in the first place.

1479
00:58:18,102 --> 00:58:19,699
I threw a clean pass...

1480
00:58:19,734 --> 00:58:21,834
they ran it out of the ballpark.

1481
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:24,566
This is blasphemy.

1482
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:27,417
It's horrible! Who else were you?

1483
00:58:27,452 --> 00:58:29,742
Solomon, Elvis, Jack the Ripper?

1484
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:31,855
It's been said that Buddha and Jesus

1485
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,934
Would laugh or cry if they'd known

1486
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,601
What was done in their name.

1487
00:58:35,636 --> 00:58:37,199
And if there is a creator,

1488
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:40,084
He'd probably feel the same way.

1489
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:42,693
I see ceremony, ritual, processions,

1490
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,397
Genuflecting, moaning, intoning,

1491
00:58:45,432 --> 00:58:48,067
Venerating cookies and wine,

1492
00:58:48,102 --> 00:58:49,833
And I think...

1493
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:51,234
it's not what I had in mind.

1494
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:52,566
But that's Vatican flapdoodle.

1495
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:55,098
It doesn't have a thing to do with god.

1496
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:58,266
As you said, John,
everywhere, religions...

1497
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:01,400
from exalting life to
purging joy as a sin.

1498
00:59:01,435 --> 00:59:04,067
Rome does it as grand opera.

1499
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:07,133
A simple path to goodness needs

1500
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,100
A supernatural roadmap.

1501
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:11,232
Supernatural...

1502
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:13,899
a stupid word, I mean...

1503
00:59:13,934 --> 00:59:15,834
anything that happens,
happens within nature,

1504
00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:17,968
Whether we believe in it or not.

1505
00:59:18,003 --> 00:59:20,067
Like a 14,000-year-old
caveman.

1506
00:59:20,102 --> 00:59:22,400
( Car approaching )

1507
00:59:28,901 --> 00:59:31,050
I--I--I drove
for a while,

1508
00:59:31,085 --> 00:59:33,200
And then I sat for a while.

1509
00:59:33,235 --> 00:59:34,599
I'm so ashamed.

1510
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:36,334
( Shivering ) and I'm freezing.

1511
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:37,599
Well, come inside.

1512
00:59:37,634 --> 00:59:39,767
I still don't believe you, of course.

1513
00:59:39,802 --> 00:59:40,799
You need help.

1514
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:41,833
Everybody needs help.

1515
00:59:41,868 --> 00:59:43,934
Yes, well, some more than others.

1516
00:59:57,934 --> 01:00:00,098
From the Buddha to the cross,

1517
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:04,801
I have always imagined
both as entirely mythic--

1518
01:00:04,836 --> 01:00:07,199
But I would like to hear more.

1519
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:09,900
May I lie on the couch for a moment?

1520
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:12,567
I'm not as young as I used to be.

1521
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:16,299
Ohh!

1522
01:00:16,334 --> 01:00:18,399
( Laughs )

1523
01:00:18,434 --> 01:00:22,466
So, you were Jesus.

1524
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:25,601
Well, perhaps somebody had to
be, for better or for worse.

1525
01:00:25,636 --> 01:00:27,332
The jury is still out.

1526
01:00:27,367 --> 01:00:30,365
When did you begin to
believe you were Jesus?

1527
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,501
When did you begin to believe
you were a psychiatrist?

1528
01:00:33,536 --> 01:00:36,599
Since I graduated Harvard medical school

1529
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:39,334
And finished my residency,
I've had that feeling.

1530
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,618
Oh, I sometimes dream about it.

1531
01:00:41,653 --> 01:00:43,833
Have you acted upon this belief?

1532
01:00:43,868 --> 01:00:46,234
I had a private practice for a while,

1533
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:47,734
And then I taught.

1534
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,165
Nothing unusual--

1535
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,467
Oh, until one day, I met a caveman

1536
01:00:52,502 --> 01:00:55,034
Who thought he was Jesus.

1537
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:57,532
Do you find that unusual?

1538
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:00,000
Very. I would stake my reputation

1539
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:02,399
He as sane as I am,

1540
01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:05,367
So why does he persist in such a story?

1541
01:01:05,402 --> 01:01:07,534
There must be a reason, though.

1542
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:09,434
Unless I imagined it all?

1543
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:10,699
Is that possible?

1544
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:12,567
I think you're as sane as he is.

1545
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,317
Oh, god, I--

1546
01:01:14,352 --> 01:01:16,033
( Laughs ) no.

1547
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:20,501
Did you ever find it
prudent to worship yourself

1548
01:01:20,536 --> 01:01:22,300
Rather than be thought a heretic?

1549
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:23,532
That would be something.

1550
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:26,100
Other times, Christianity
was considered heresy.

1551
01:01:26,135 --> 01:01:27,866
I had to pretend other faiths.

1552
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:31,968
And what does Jesus have
to say to those present

1553
01:01:32,003 --> 01:01:34,367
Who find it difficult to believe in him?

1554
01:01:34,402 --> 01:01:37,033
Believe in what he tried to teach,

1555
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,965
Without rigmarole.

1556
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,683
Piety is not what the
lessons bring to people.

1557
01:01:41,718 --> 01:01:44,367
It's the mistake they
bring to the lessons.

1558
01:01:51,767 --> 01:01:54,501
Well, it's getting to be night.

1559
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,167
I still have stuff to carry

1560
01:01:58,202 --> 01:02:00,534
And a long drive.

1561
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:02,065
I'll help.

1562
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,701
John, do you have a
destination in mind?

1563
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:08,450
Never mind.

1564
01:02:08,485 --> 01:02:09,834
I won't ask.

1565
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:11,901
Thank you.

1566
01:02:19,267 --> 01:02:22,098
Anyone mentally ill can imagine

1567
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:25,100
A fantastic background--
Even an entire life--

1568
01:02:25,135 --> 01:02:27,399
And sincerely believe it.

1569
01:02:27,434 --> 01:02:30,033
The man who thinks he is napoleon

1570
01:02:30,068 --> 01:02:31,899
Does believe it.

1571
01:02:31,934 --> 01:02:34,850
His true identity has taken a backseat

1572
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:37,767
To his delusion and the need for it.

1573
01:02:37,802 --> 01:02:39,784
If that's the case with John,

1574
01:02:39,819 --> 01:02:42,026
There is a grave disorder.

1575
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:44,199
Organized brilliantly.

1576
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:46,299
He's got an answer for everything.

1577
01:02:46,334 --> 01:02:48,968
It might involve
rejection of his father,

1578
01:02:49,003 --> 01:02:50,651
Of his entire early past,

1579
01:02:50,686 --> 01:02:52,265
Replaced by this fantasy.

1580
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,400
He says he can't remember his father.

1581
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:55,399
Precisely why?

1582
01:02:55,434 --> 01:02:57,000
You said he was sane.

1583
01:02:57,035 --> 01:02:58,300
Did I?

1584
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,200
Do you think that perhaps our caveman

1585
01:03:02,235 --> 01:03:04,000
Has a monkey on his back?

1586
01:03:04,035 --> 01:03:05,599
Drugs?

1587
01:03:05,634 --> 01:03:07,098
No, no, no, no.

1588
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:09,534
I've done a lot of consulting
work with narcotics.

1589
01:03:09,569 --> 01:03:11,651
I've seen people
tripping, strung out--

1590
01:03:11,686 --> 01:03:13,734
Whatever's up with John, it isn't that.

1591
01:03:13,769 --> 01:03:15,618
I've looked
for signs--None.

1592
01:03:15,653 --> 01:03:17,432
Could cavemen really talk?

1593
01:03:17,467 --> 01:03:19,868
We think that language
came into existence

1594
01:03:19,903 --> 01:03:21,132
60,000 years ago.

1595
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:23,165
The structure of stone age culture

1596
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,467
Is evidence of the
ability to communicate--

1597
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:26,866
Verbally.

1598
01:03:26,901 --> 01:03:28,567
( Wolf whistles; clicks )

1599
01:03:28,602 --> 01:03:30,734
Oh, shut up.

1600
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:42,100
Maybe it'd be easier if I were.

1601
01:03:42,135 --> 01:03:43,267
Crazy?

1602
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:46,065
No.

1603
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,100
( Coyote howls )

1604
01:03:59,234 --> 01:04:01,965
That is fascinating, isn't it,

1605
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,133
A brave attempt to teach
Buddhism in the west.

1606
01:04:05,168 --> 01:04:06,851
It's no wonder he failed.

1607
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:08,499
We're not ready for it.

1608
01:04:08,534 --> 01:04:10,968
You're talking
as if you believed him.

1609
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:13,135
Well, it is possible, isn't it?

1610
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,151
I mean, anything is possible.

1611
01:04:15,186 --> 01:04:17,393
Look, we have two simple choices.

1612
01:04:17,428 --> 01:04:19,566
We can get all bent out of shape

1613
01:04:19,601 --> 01:04:21,968
Intellectualizing or
bench-pressing logic,

1614
01:04:22,003 --> 01:04:24,601
Or we can simply relax and enjoy it.

1615
01:04:24,636 --> 01:04:26,399
I can listen critically,

1616
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:29,801
But I don't have to make
up my mind about anything.

1617
01:04:29,836 --> 01:04:31,265
But you think you do?

1618
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,033
Well, unfortunately, there's
no authorities on prehistory,

1619
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:35,851
So we couldn't stop him there.

1620
01:04:35,886 --> 01:04:37,634
There are experts on the bible.

1621
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:39,232
Dream on.

1622
01:04:39,267 --> 01:04:41,566
Yeah, thus the lost years of Jesus.

1623
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:44,265
He didn't exist until John put on a hat.

1624
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,334
I don't believe in angels and the
nativity and the star in the east,

1625
01:04:48,369 --> 01:04:51,467
But there are stories about
the childhood of Jesus.

1626
01:04:51,502 --> 01:04:53,866
History hates a vacuum.

1627
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:56,467
Improvisation, some of it very sincere,

1628
01:04:56,502 --> 01:04:57,599
Fills the gaps.

1629
01:04:57,634 --> 01:04:58,965
It would have been easy

1630
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,899
To falsify a
past back then--

1631
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:05,300
A few words, credulity--
Time would do the rest.

1632
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,501
Now you're talking as
if you believed him.

1633
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,632
Well, look at the
popular myths surrounding

1634
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:12,300
The Kennedy assassination
in a few short years--

1635
01:05:12,335 --> 01:05:15,334
You had, uh,
conspiracy, Mafia, CIA--

1636
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,299
That's a mystique that'll never go away.

1637
01:05:18,334 --> 01:05:22,167
It's always been a small step
from a fallen leader to a god.

1638
01:05:22,202 --> 01:05:25,033
I don't think anybody
will deify Kennedy.

1639
01:05:25,068 --> 01:05:27,000
We're more sophisticated than that.

1640
01:05:27,035 --> 01:05:28,601
We are?

1641
01:05:28,636 --> 01:05:30,167
We are.

1642
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,365
Well, you're finally fulfilling

1643
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,300
One prophecy about the millennium, John.

1644
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:39,532
What's that?

1645
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:42,133
Here you are again.

1646
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:53,666
You like the fire, John.

1647
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:57,200
Everywhere I've lived,
I've had a fireplace.

1648
01:05:57,235 --> 01:05:59,701
Childhood fixation, I guess.

1649
01:06:01,367 --> 01:06:03,400
Helps me to feel secure.

1650
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:06,868
There are predators out there.

1651
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,117
One thing I didn't pack...

1652
01:06:11,152 --> 01:06:12,934
I thought I might need it.

1653
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:18,400
( Plays Beethoven's 7th symphony )

1654
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:23,467
<i>Wouldn't sacre du printemps
be more appropriate?</i>

1655
01:06:23,502 --> 01:06:24,534
What?

1656
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,232
You've got...

1657
01:06:28,267 --> 01:06:31,434
four men of science
completely baffled, my friend.

1658
01:06:31,469 --> 01:06:33,998
We--We don't know
what to make of you.

1659
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:36,766
Did you know Voltaire
was the first to suggest

1660
01:06:36,801 --> 01:06:40,234
That the universe was created
by a gigantic explosion?

1661
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:42,532
I think Paul would agree.

1662
01:06:42,567 --> 01:06:44,998
And then Goethe was the first to suggest

1663
01:06:45,033 --> 01:06:48,901
That spiral nebulae were
swirling masses of stars.

1664
01:06:48,936 --> 01:06:51,065
We now call them galaxies.

1665
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,799
It's kind of funny how
often new concepts of science

1666
01:06:53,834 --> 01:06:56,734
Find their first tentative
forms of expression in the arts.

1667
01:06:56,769 --> 01:07:01,666
So did Beethoven do physics on the side?

1668
01:07:01,701 --> 01:07:05,000
He spent most of his
time lying on the floor

1669
01:07:05,035 --> 01:07:06,699
In front of his legless piano

1670
01:07:06,734 --> 01:07:09,467
Surrounded by orange
peels and apple cores.

1671
01:07:11,634 --> 01:07:14,434
Now we're on the floor
listening to Beethoven.

1672
01:07:15,701 --> 01:07:17,232
Full circle.

1673
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,567
Did you have, um...

1674
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:22,365
any religious beliefs,

1675
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,650
Or did you give it much thought?

1676
01:07:24,685 --> 01:07:26,901
You can't get there with thought.

1677
01:07:26,936 --> 01:07:28,585
You have faith?

1678
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:30,199
In a lot of things.

1679
01:07:30,234 --> 01:07:33,300
Do you have faith in
the future of the race?

1680
01:07:33,335 --> 01:07:35,265
I've seen species come and go.

1681
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,367
Depends on their balance
with the environment.

1682
01:07:39,067 --> 01:07:40,767
We've made a mess of it.

1683
01:07:40,802 --> 01:07:42,484
There's still time,

1684
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:44,132
If we use it well.

1685
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:46,868
Christianity has been a worldwide belief

1686
01:07:46,903 --> 01:07:48,566
For 2,000 years.

1687
01:07:48,601 --> 01:07:50,801
How long did the Egyptians worship Isis

1688
01:07:50,836 --> 01:07:52,432
Or the Sumerians Ishtar?

1689
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:55,100
In India, sacred cows wandered freely

1690
01:07:55,135 --> 01:07:56,933
As reincarnated souls.

1691
01:07:56,968 --> 01:07:58,734
In a thousand years,
they'll be barbecued

1692
01:07:58,769 --> 01:08:00,334
And their souls will be in squirrels.

1693
01:08:00,369 --> 01:08:01,701
You weren't Jesus!

1694
01:08:03,734 --> 01:08:04,934
Oh, Edith.

1695
01:08:07,734 --> 01:08:10,501
( Clears throat ) if
it rains... it won't.

1696
01:08:10,536 --> 01:08:11,885
How do you know that?

1697
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,234
I don't smell it.

1698
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:17,667
Were you...

1699
01:08:18,934 --> 01:08:21,200
I guess... a medicine man?

1700
01:08:21,235 --> 01:08:23,432
I was a shaman a few times.

1701
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:26,801
I revealed some truths
to eat a little better.

1702
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,868
You think that's all
religion is about...

1703
01:08:29,903 --> 01:08:32,432
selling hope and survival?

1704
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:34,833
The old testament sells fear and guilt.

1705
01:08:34,868 --> 01:08:37,450
The new testament is
a good code of ethics,

1706
01:08:37,485 --> 01:08:40,033
Put into my mouth by
poets and philosophers

1707
01:08:40,068 --> 01:08:42,134
That are much smarter than I am.

1708
01:08:42,169 --> 01:08:44,200
The message is never practiced.

1709
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:47,000
Fairy tales build churches.

1710
01:08:48,067 --> 01:08:50,217
What about the name "Jesus"?

1711
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:52,367
Did you pull that out of a hat?

1712
01:08:52,402 --> 01:08:54,734
I called myself John.

1713
01:08:54,769 --> 01:08:57,032
I almost always do.

1714
01:08:57,067 --> 01:08:59,098
As tales of the resurrection spread,

1715
01:08:59,133 --> 01:09:01,901
<i>The name was confused
with the Hebrew "yochanan,"</i>

1716
01:09:01,936 --> 01:09:03,751
Meaning "god is gracious."

1717
01:09:03,786 --> 01:09:05,532
My stay on earth was seen

1718
01:09:05,567 --> 01:09:09,217
As divine proof of immortality.

1719
01:09:09,252 --> 01:09:12,868
That led to "god is salvation"

1720
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:14,365
<i>Or Hebrew "yahshua,"</i>

1721
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,567
Which in translation
became my proper name,

1722
01:09:17,602 --> 01:09:20,201
<i>Changing to late Greek, "iesous,"</i>

1723
01:09:20,236 --> 01:09:22,766
<i>Then to late Latin, "iesus,"</i>

1724
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:25,399
And finally medieval Latin, "Jesus,"

1725
01:09:25,434 --> 01:09:28,400
And it was a wonder
to watch it all happen.

1726
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:31,551
Then you didn't claim
to be the son of god?

1727
01:09:31,586 --> 01:09:34,632
Began as a schoolhouse
and ended as a temple.

1728
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:38,234
I said I had a master that
was greater than myself.

1729
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:40,251
I never said he was my father.

1730
01:09:40,286 --> 01:09:42,199
I wanted to teach what I learned.

1731
01:09:42,234 --> 01:09:44,299
I never claimed to be king of the Jews,

1732
01:09:44,334 --> 01:09:47,467
I never walked on water,
I never raised the dead.

1733
01:09:47,502 --> 01:09:50,801
I never spoke of divine
except in the sense

1734
01:09:50,836 --> 01:09:52,968
Of human goodness on earth.

1735
01:09:56,501 --> 01:10:00,100
No wise men came from the
east to worship at a manger.

1736
01:10:00,135 --> 01:10:02,232
I did do a little healing

1737
01:10:02,267 --> 01:10:04,100
With some eastern medicine I'd learned.

1738
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:08,000
That's it.

1739
01:10:11,801 --> 01:10:13,684
The three wise men began as a myth

1740
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:15,567
About the birth of the Buddha.

1741
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,267
John, I should be home,
uh, kissing my wife.

1742
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:28,634
We're all here, trapped by your story...

1743
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:35,868
hoping for a...revolution? I don't know.

1744
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,150
Are there any, uh...

1745
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:43,100
more revelations for us?

1746
01:10:49,567 --> 01:10:51,467
It's just like old times.

1747
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,067
You weren't Jesus.

1748
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:05,267
Quote the sermon on the mount.

1749
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,566
Which one?

1750
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:09,801
Darby, King James,
New American Standard?

1751
01:11:09,836 --> 01:11:11,666
Do you know them all?

1752
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:14,868
No one knows the one, not even me.

1753
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,199
I...

1754
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:18,534
I did some teaching on a hill one day.

1755
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:20,601
Not that many people stayed.

1756
01:11:20,636 --> 01:11:21,732
But you...

1757
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:24,400
biblical Jesus said,

1758
01:11:24,435 --> 01:11:26,551
"Who do you think I am?"

1759
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:28,667
He gave them a choice.

1760
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,567
I'm giving you one.

1761
01:11:34,534 --> 01:11:35,901
Were you?

1762
01:11:37,901 --> 01:11:40,534
If I said no, could you ever be sure?

1763
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:50,567
( Sobs )

1764
01:11:57,701 --> 01:11:59,634
Turn that off.

1765
01:11:59,669 --> 01:12:00,601
Please.

1766
01:12:03,701 --> 01:12:05,717
This has gone far enough.

1767
01:12:05,752 --> 01:12:07,699
It's gone much too far.

1768
01:12:07,734 --> 01:12:10,284
These people are very upset.

1769
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:12,799
I don't believe you're mad,

1770
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:15,133
But what you're saying is not true.

1771
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:19,067
That leaves only one explanation.

1772
01:12:20,234 --> 01:12:22,334
The time has come when you must admit

1773
01:12:22,369 --> 01:12:23,534
This is a hoax...

1774
01:12:25,234 --> 01:12:26,499
a lie.

1775
01:12:26,534 --> 01:12:30,165
Isn't that true, John?

1776
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,968
If you don't drop
this now-- If you can--

1777
01:12:33,003 --> 01:12:34,499
I'll be convinced

1778
01:12:34,534 --> 01:12:37,484
That you need a great deal of attention.

1779
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,434
I can have you committed
for observation.

1780
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:42,101
You know that.

1781
01:12:42,136 --> 01:12:44,052
I ask
you now--

1782
01:12:44,087 --> 01:12:45,933
I demand
it--

1783
01:12:45,968 --> 01:12:49,033
That you tell these people the truth.

1784
01:12:49,068 --> 01:12:52,317
Give them closure.

1785
01:12:52,352 --> 01:12:55,567
It's time, John.

1786
01:12:55,602 --> 01:12:56,767
Please.

1787
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:13,200
End of the line. Everybody off.

1788
01:13:16,467 --> 01:13:18,432
What?!

1789
01:13:18,467 --> 01:13:20,600
It was a story.

1790
01:13:20,635 --> 01:13:22,734
It was all a story.

1791
01:13:22,769 --> 01:13:23,718
( Sobs )

1792
01:13:23,753 --> 01:13:24,667
Good god!

1793
01:13:26,467 --> 01:13:28,250
Another fairy tale?

1794
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:29,998
All of it?
But what--

1795
01:13:30,033 --> 01:13:31,399
What in the name of heaven...

1796
01:13:31,434 --> 01:13:33,667
John, you had us wondering
whether you were sane or not,

1797
01:13:33,702 --> 01:13:35,265
And it's just a story!

1798
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,601
Where'd you come off with such
a half-baked, asinine idea?

1799
01:13:38,636 --> 01:13:40,400
At least you're relieved I'm not a nut.

1800
01:13:40,435 --> 01:13:42,068
I'd prefer you were!

1801
01:13:42,103 --> 01:13:43,701
You gave me the idea.

1802
01:13:43,736 --> 01:13:45,101
All of you.

1803
01:13:45,136 --> 01:13:46,432
Come again?

1804
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:48,034
Edith saw my fake Van Gogh.

1805
01:13:48,069 --> 01:13:49,485
You could have just told me.

1806
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,110
You commented that I never age.

1807
01:13:51,145 --> 01:13:52,701
You gave me the book on early man.

1808
01:13:52,736 --> 01:13:54,299
Dan, you spotted the burin

1809
01:13:54,334 --> 01:13:56,000
And you said, "if stones could speak."

1810
01:13:56,035 --> 01:13:57,632
I knew it.

1811
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:00,098
I got the notion, I ran it past you

1812
01:14:00,133 --> 01:14:02,701
To check your reactions,
and I took it too far.

1813
01:14:02,736 --> 01:14:04,065
Too far?

1814
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,566
Check my reaction.

1815
01:14:05,601 --> 01:14:08,167
You asked if I was a figure
from religious history,

1816
01:14:08,202 --> 01:14:09,684
If there were others like me,

1817
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:11,132
If I'd created future identities.

1818
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:14,317
We were chasing our
tails around the maypole,

1819
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:17,467
Enjoying the mystery,
the analytical stretch.

1820
01:14:17,502 --> 01:14:19,400
You were playing my game!

1821
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:20,965
I was playing yours.

1822
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,601
Oh, man, you know, you
had us going, right?

1823
01:14:23,636 --> 01:14:24,833
You were good, man.

1824
01:14:24,868 --> 01:14:26,332
You know those Chinese boxes,

1825
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:29,434
One inside the other inside
the other inside the other--

1826
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:32,501
I feel like I'm in the last box.

1827
01:14:32,536 --> 01:14:34,801
You son of a...

1828
01:14:34,836 --> 01:14:35,833
bitch!

1829
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:37,684
How could you do this to us?

1830
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:39,466
I was worried about you.

1831
01:14:39,501 --> 01:14:41,850
I know, I was tempted
to cop out many times,

1832
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:44,200
But I couldn't resist
seeing whether or not

1833
01:14:44,235 --> 01:14:45,968
You could refute what I was saying.

1834
01:14:46,003 --> 01:14:47,902
I had the
perfect audience--

1835
01:14:47,937 --> 01:14:49,801
Anthropologist, archaeologist,

1836
01:14:49,836 --> 01:14:51,901
Christian literalist...

1837
01:14:51,936 --> 01:14:54,065
a psychologist.

1838
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,165
Okay, I've had enough of this.

1839
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,267
I'm outta here. You
wanna come? Let's go.

1840
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,632
So, John.

1841
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,267
Are you gonna write the story?

1842
01:15:02,302 --> 01:15:03,901
If I do, I'll send you copies.

1843
01:15:03,936 --> 01:15:06,151
Don't bother with mine, okay?

1844
01:15:06,186 --> 01:15:08,367
You are absolutely certifiable.

1845
01:15:08,402 --> 01:15:10,100
I don't know you!

1846
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,801
It was nice seeing
you again, Dr. Oldman.

1847
01:15:16,234 --> 01:15:18,033
Your name's a pun, isn't it?

1848
01:15:18,068 --> 01:15:19,033
Old man?

1849
01:15:20,901 --> 01:15:23,501
Did that help you with your story?

1850
01:15:23,536 --> 01:15:25,133
Linda!

1851
01:15:26,767 --> 01:15:27,834
Bye.

1852
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,234
Well, Art was half right.

1853
01:15:33,269 --> 01:15:34,768
( Laughs )

1854
01:15:34,803 --> 01:15:36,267
Which half?

1855
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:42,067
Well, at least I don't
have to throw away half

1856
01:15:42,102 --> 01:15:43,868
Of what I know about biology.

1857
01:15:43,903 --> 01:15:45,501
Which half?

1858
01:15:45,536 --> 01:15:47,065
( Chuckles )

1859
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,165
It's a beautiful idea,

1860
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:53,067
So rich, so full of possibilities.

1861
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:56,434
Perhaps you should write
a paper on it, doctor.

1862
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,165
Maybe I will.

1863
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,367
I'll interview you in the rubber room

1864
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:01,866
For further details.

1865
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:03,934
You may still need help, my friend.

1866
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:18,899
My ass.

1867
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:21,098
I thought it sounded pretty good.

1868
01:16:21,133 --> 01:16:23,200
They believe you because they have to.

1869
01:16:23,235 --> 01:16:25,267
But the one thing that I know about you

1870
01:16:25,302 --> 01:16:26,833
Is that you would never use people

1871
01:16:26,868 --> 01:16:28,601
Or abuse their goodwill and intelligence

1872
01:16:28,636 --> 01:16:30,334
Like they think you've
just done to them.

1873
01:16:30,369 --> 01:16:31,466
Psych 101?

1874
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:34,065
No, it's woman,
one-on-one.

1875
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,883
So you're a pretty fast liar, Mr. Ugg,

1876
01:16:36,918 --> 01:16:40,759
But I wanna know--
What's your real name?

1877
01:16:40,794 --> 01:16:44,601
Believe it or not, the
sound was always John.

1878
01:16:44,636 --> 01:16:46,535
Why'd you cave to Gruber?

1879
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:48,202
What happened was enough.

1880
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:49,799
Just--Just
needed to stop.

1881
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:52,000
I shouldn't have expected it to work.

1882
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,350
Fourteen thousand years old.

1883
01:16:55,385 --> 01:16:57,300
I bet that's a lot of women.

1884
01:16:57,335 --> 01:16:59,300
Are we counting?

1885
01:16:59,335 --> 01:17:00,667
Maybe.

1886
01:17:02,634 --> 01:17:04,701
Well, I'm taking Edith home.

1887
01:17:04,736 --> 01:17:05,634
Sandy?

1888
01:17:07,033 --> 01:17:08,567
I'm gonna stay.

1889
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:15,300
Are you sorry for some
of those things you said?

1890
01:17:15,335 --> 01:17:17,868
I'm sorry I said them.

1891
01:17:17,903 --> 01:17:19,332
Well.

1892
01:17:19,367 --> 01:17:20,834
Like a good Christian,

1893
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,351
I...oh, John.

1894
01:17:23,386 --> 01:17:25,834
Oh! Well.

1895
01:17:27,033 --> 01:17:29,265
You did a terrible thing,

1896
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,699
But we're all so
thankful you're all right.

1897
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:34,801
Even Art--He just hates
things he can't understand.

1898
01:17:34,836 --> 01:17:36,599
You're a sadist, John,

1899
01:17:36,634 --> 01:17:38,732
But I admit I got a kick out of

1900
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:40,501
Chasing my tail around your maypole...

1901
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:42,701
even if that is all I caught.

1902
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:43,866
Good luck to you.

1903
01:17:43,901 --> 01:17:45,467
Wish you the best. Thank you.

1904
01:17:45,502 --> 01:17:46,501
Ready?

1905
01:17:55,534 --> 01:17:57,400
- Later on.
- Okay, good night.

1906
01:18:00,234 --> 01:18:01,167
Mm-hmm.

1907
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:05,799
Mmm.

1908
01:18:05,834 --> 01:18:08,732
I don't know, man.

1909
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,734
Something about this...

1910
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:13,018
something about you, John.

1911
01:18:13,053 --> 01:18:15,232
The more I think about it,

1912
01:18:15,267 --> 01:18:18,133
The more I'm no longer
in that Chinese box.

1913
01:18:18,168 --> 01:18:20,034
( Inhaling deeply )

1914
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:21,866
I sense...space.

1915
01:18:21,901 --> 01:18:26,801
A kinda latitude of what
we happily call reality,

1916
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:29,868
In which, as everybody keeps saying...

1917
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,933
anything's possible.

1918
01:18:32,968 --> 01:18:34,834
Yes. No, no. No, no.

1919
01:18:34,869 --> 01:18:36,668
No--No
more words.

1920
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:38,432
I'm gonna go home,

1921
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:40,267
<i>And I'm gonna watch star trek</i>

1922
01:18:40,302 --> 01:18:42,384
For a dose of sanity.

1923
01:18:42,419 --> 01:18:44,432
Good luck to you, man,

1924
01:18:44,467 --> 01:18:46,883
Wherever this may lead you.

1925
01:18:46,918 --> 01:18:49,265
You drop me a line sometime.

1926
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,133
Let me know how you're making out.

1927
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:53,667
I will.

1928
01:18:55,968 --> 01:18:57,200
Mm. Mwah.

1929
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:08,032
So, John Oldman.

1930
01:19:08,067 --> 01:19:10,634
What other pun names have you used?

1931
01:19:10,669 --> 01:19:11,968
Lots.

1932
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:16,567
John Paley for John Paleolithic,

1933
01:19:16,602 --> 01:19:18,965
John Savage--

1934
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,100
Got really crazy about 60 years ago.

1935
01:19:21,135 --> 01:19:22,968
When I was teaching at Harvard,

1936
01:19:23,003 --> 01:19:25,799
I was John Thomas Partee.

1937
01:19:25,834 --> 01:19:28,367
John T. Partee--
Boston tea party--

1938
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:29,584
I get it.

1939
01:19:29,619 --> 01:19:30,826
Yeah, I know.

1940
01:19:30,861 --> 01:19:32,033
Wait, wait, wait.

1941
01:19:32,068 --> 01:19:34,365
Boston?

1942
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,533
60 years ago?

1943
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:38,667
J-John Partee?

1944
01:19:42,567 --> 01:19:47,133
You did not teach chemistry!
I do not believe you!

1945
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,968
Your mother's name was Nola.

1946
01:19:51,003 --> 01:19:52,200
No. Yeah.

1947
01:19:52,235 --> 01:19:54,265
No.

1948
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:56,766
Yes, Nola.

1949
01:19:56,801 --> 01:19:58,434
( Crying ) my mother!

1950
01:19:59,801 --> 01:20:01,400
I reject this!

1951
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
My--My--My
dog's name.

1952
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,000
We had him before I was born.

1953
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:09,032
Woofie.

1954
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:10,400
Woof, woof, woofie...

1955
01:20:15,901 --> 01:20:17,851
Gruber. She remarried?

1956
01:20:17,886 --> 01:20:19,801
She said you abandoned us.

1957
01:20:20,868 --> 01:20:22,532
Sorry, I had to move on.

1958
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:24,300
You know that. I left enough.

1959
01:20:24,335 --> 01:20:26,484
I left enough. I'm cold.

1960
01:20:26,519 --> 01:20:28,610
Chilly willy, always cold.

1961
01:20:28,645 --> 01:20:30,666
Never could stand the cold.

1962
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:34,400
( Sobs ) wait, you--
You had a beard.

1963
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:36,067
Yeah, you used to tug on it

1964
01:20:36,102 --> 01:20:37,634
To see if it was real.

1965
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:39,200
Agh! Will!

1966
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:40,133
God.

1967
01:20:41,567 --> 01:20:42,998
911, now!

1968
01:20:43,033 --> 01:20:44,900
( Gruber gasps )

1969
01:20:44,935 --> 01:20:46,767
Come on, Will.

1970
01:20:46,802 --> 01:20:47,933
Will.

1971
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:48,901
Come on, buddy.

1972
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,334
( Siren blaring )

1973
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,183
You'll stay in touch, Dr. Oldman.

1974
01:21:23,218 --> 01:21:25,326
In case there are any questions.

1975
01:21:25,361 --> 01:21:27,434
I'll be back for the funeral.

1976
01:21:27,469 --> 01:21:28,467
Miss.

1977
01:21:38,734 --> 01:21:40,901
You never saw a grown child die.

1978
01:21:42,367 --> 01:21:43,300
No.

1979
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:28,667
Chantelle Duncan: * I've seen rivers rise *

1980
01:23:28,702 --> 01:23:32,866
* seen mountains fall *

1981
01:23:32,901 --> 01:23:38,234
* seen endless vistas coming to an end *

1982
01:23:39,667 --> 01:23:43,634
* I've seen stars collide *

1983
01:23:43,669 --> 01:23:47,632
* heard oceans roar *

1984
01:23:47,667 --> 01:23:54,200
* I know what it means
to lose your only friend *

1985
01:23:56,267 --> 01:23:59,766
* nothing lasts forever *

1986
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:03,234
* that's what I've always heard *

1987
01:24:03,269 --> 01:24:06,200
* all things good must end *

1988
01:24:06,235 --> 01:24:09,801
* you know it's true *

1989
01:24:10,934 --> 01:24:14,500
* nothing lasts forever *

1990
01:24:14,535 --> 01:24:18,032
* but maybe some things do *

1991
01:24:18,067 --> 01:24:24,850
* forever is the way I feel for you *

1992
01:24:24,885 --> 01:24:31,634
* forever is the way I feel for you *

1993
01:24:43,968 --> 01:24:47,632
* I've seen men take *

1994
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:51,732
* the world into their hands *

1995
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:56,934
* and change it, mold it,
to their point of view *

1996
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,683
* I've felt the earth shake *

1997
01:25:02,718 --> 01:25:06,232
* seen men take a stand *

1998
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:12,767
* and fight when it's
the one thing left to do *

1999
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:18,265
* nothing lasts forever *

2000
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:22,234
* that's what I've always heard *

2001
01:25:22,269 --> 01:25:24,734

2004
01:25:33,185 --> 01:25:36,699

2005
01:25:36,734 --> 01:25:43,517

2006
