00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:03,901
I just don't want
the bubble to burst.

174
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,570
Seems like, uh...

175
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:12,638
whenever anything good
in my life happens,

176
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:15,971
I'm just afraid
I'm going to lose it.

177
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:22,912
I love you.

178
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,955
I really love you.

179
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:29,620
Ditto.

180
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:34,130
The pilot
first reported trouble

181
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,131
when the number two
engine blew,

182
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,601
the one in the tail
of the plane...

183
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:42,037
Oh,Jesus,
another one?

184
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,533
Oh, don't watch that.

185
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,904
I should cancel
my L.A. trip.

186
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:53,041
These things always
happen in threes.

187
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,143
Sam, get serious.

188
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,585
Besides, you lead
a charmed life.

189
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,657
Oh, yeah?
So did they.

190
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,452
It's amazing.

191
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,119
Just like that.

192
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:05,423
Blackout.

193
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,517
 Oh 

194
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:07,284
 My love 

195
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,691
 My darlin'

196
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,196
 I've hungered for... 

197
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:14,663
What are you doing?

198
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:17,693
I couldn't sleep.

199
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,704
 A long 

200
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,001
 Lonely time 

201
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,041
I must
have passed out.

202
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:27,270
What time is it?

203
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,710
It's 2 a.m.

204
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,375
 And time 

205
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:36,250
 Goes by 

206
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,653
 So slowly 

207
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,625
 And time 

208
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:46,630
 Can do so much 

209
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:50,634
 Are you 

210
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,034
 Still mine 

211
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:55,139
Oh, no.

212
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,241
I hope it wasn't
a masterpiece.

213
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,037
It's not now.

214
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,212
Can I help?

215
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,339
Yeah.

216
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:06,349
Put your hands here
and get them wet.

217
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,620
Just let the clay
slide between your fingers.

218
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,422
 Godspeed your love 

219
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:21,762
 To me 

220
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,408
 Lonely rivers flow 

221
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,374
 To the sea 

222
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,604
 To the sea 

223
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,672
 To the open arms 

224
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,081
 Of the sea 

225
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,846
 Yeah 

226
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,146
 Lonely rivers sigh 

227
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,757
 Wait for me 

228
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,258
 Wait for me 

229
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,330
 I'll be comin'home 

230
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:56,527
 Wait for me 

231
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,102
 Oh 

232
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:03,640
 My love 

233
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:07,337
 My darlin'

234
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,437
 I've hungered 

235
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:14,679
 Hungered for your touch 

236
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:17,755
 A long 

237
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,656
 Lonely time 

238
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,294
 And time 

239
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,768
 Goes by 

240
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:36,670
 So slowly 

241
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,710
 And time 

242
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:43,339
 Can do so much 

243
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,215
 Are you 

244
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:53,451
 Still mine 

245
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:58,461
 I need 

246
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:01,828
 Your love 

247
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:05,198
 I 

248
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:09,103
 I need your love 

249
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:12,870
 Godspeed your love 

250
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:19,448
 To me 렁

251
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,862
Oh, no.

252
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,831
What's the matter?

253
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:12,867
A glitch.
What's up?

254
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,872
The Greenberg and White accounts--
I can't get in.

255
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,305
The Mac code
isn't working.

256
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,603
Oh, I changed it.

257
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,609
Why?

258
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,340
Nothing. I want to
nose around a bit.

259
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,778
Is something wrong?

260
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,645
Can you keep a secret?

261
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,382
Yeah, sure.

262
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,648
What's up?

263
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,258
There's too much money
in these accounts.

264
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,326
Too much money?
That's impossible.

265
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,831
Sam, this is going
to take you hours.

266
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:46,426
Let me do this.

267
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,869
It's already
taken me hours.

268
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:49,429
Let me figure it out.

269
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,872
No, that's OK.

270
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,876
It's like
a vendetta now.

271
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:54,878
Thanks, though.
I appreciate it.

272
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:55,970
OK.

273
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,016
If you start to go blind,
give a shout.

274
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,552
OK. Adios.

275
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,884
Listen, what are you
and Moll doing tonight?

276
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,924
We're going to the theater
to see Macbeth.

277
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,994
She likes
the guys in tights.

278
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,626
You want to go?

279
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,754
No, thanks.

280
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,491
I want a full
report, though.

281
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,657
Later.

282
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:16,792
Yeah.

283
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,771
Well, I loved it.

284
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,366
I was spellbound
the whole time.

285
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:27,775
I could tell.

286
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,369
So could
everyone else

287
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,938
with that resonating
snore of yours.

288
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,523
Did I tell you
what Melissa said?

289
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:40,955
Yeah, about six times.

290
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,526
It wasn't six times.

291
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:44,959
Quit being
so blase about this.

292
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,553
This is really
important.

293
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,963
I'll have two pieces
in her gallery.

294
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:53,003
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

295
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,594
Molly,
The New York Times

296
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,607
is just some
frustrated little critic

297
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,940
with pimples on his ass
who flunked art school.

298
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,410
Who cares what they think?

299
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,845
About eight million
readers, that's who.

300
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:07,749
Nah, they're just
reading the sports page.

301
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,753
Your work
is really beautiful.

302
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,355
It really is.

303
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:12,480
Thanks.

304
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,922
It shouldn't matter
what anyone else thinks,

305
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:16,493
just what I think.

306
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:23,898
I want
to marry you, Sam.

307
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,333
What?

308
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,700
What?

309
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,364
Yep.

310
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,738
I've been
thinking about it.

311
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,301
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

312
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:37,540
and I think we
should just do it.

313
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,412
You're serious.

314
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:40,883
Yeah.

315
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:46,418
What's that look for?

316
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,465
You never wanted
to talk about it.

317
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,939
Do you love me, Sam?

318
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,070
Well, what do you think?

319
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,110
Why don't you
ever say it?

320
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:14,682
What do you mean?
I say it all the time.

321
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,117
No, you say ''ditto,''

322
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,447
and that's
not the same.

323
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,992
People say I love you
all the time,

324
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,528
and it doesn't
mean anything.

325
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:31,033
You know, sometimes
you need to hear it.

326
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,167
I need to hear it.

327
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:36,965
Let's go.

328
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,981
What should we do?

329
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,542
Let me handle it.

330
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,984
What do you want?

331
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:52,021
Your wallet--
give it to me!

332
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:55,149
Sam, just give it to him.

333
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,889
OK, just take the money.
Just leave--

334
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,728
No, Sam--

335
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,734
You son of a bitch!

336
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,734
Sam, don't!

337
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,530
Somebody help us!

338
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,701
Jesus Christ, Sam!

339
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,539
Just get off him.

340
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,239
Somebody!

341
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:19,210
Somebody help us!

342
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,076
Sam, just let...

343

get used to it.

We must
surrender them all.

We are all travelers
on the same road,

446

which leads
to the same end.

As our loved one
enters eternal life,

let us remember
that love, too, is eternal.

we will miss him,

your shirts today.

to tell you hello.

about you every minute.

You relax.
You're the dead guy.

845
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,528
Want me to help?
You apologize.

846
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,528
Jesus Christ!

847
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,689
I'm leaving.

848
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:18,096
Nobody talks to me like that,
you understand?

849
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:19,657
Now, you better
apologize.

850
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,100
I'm sorry.

851
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,102
I apologize.

852
00:52:22,171 --> 00:52:23,729
OK?

853
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,604
Now, would you
sit down?

854
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:27,607
Please?

855
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,837
He's apologized.

856
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,982
I need you to tell
Molly what I'm saying,

857
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,985
but you have to tell her
word for word.

858
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:40,544
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying

859
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,783
word for word.

860
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,027
Molly, you're in danger.

861
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:52,033
You can't just
blurt it out like that.

862
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,830
And quit moving around,
will you?

863
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,427
You're making me dizzy.

864
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:57,938
I'll just tell her
in my own way.

865
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:01,566
Molly, you in danger,
girl.

866
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,612
What are you
talking about?

867
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,773
I know the man
who killed me.

868
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,406
He knows
who killed him.

869
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,077
His name's Willy Lopez.
I know where he lives.

870
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:12,119
He's a Puerto Rican,
Willy Lopez.

871
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:13,654
He knows
where he lives.

872
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:14,655
Write it down.

873
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,055
You write it down.

874
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,626
I ain't no
damn secretary.

875
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:18,659
Just do it!

876
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:20,092
Argh!

877
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,630
He's so testy.

878
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:25,667
What is it you
want me to write?

879
00:53:25,768 --> 00:53:28,566
It's 303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

880
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:30,002
303 Prospect Place?

881
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:31,005
Yeah.

882
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,132
That's my
neighborhood.

883
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:35,176
Molly, he's got
my wallet,

884
00:53:35,244 --> 00:53:36,734
he's got my key,

885
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,177
and he was
in here.

886
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:41,614
He's got his wallet
and key and was here.

887
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,618
Yesterday after your
walk with Carl,

888
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,052
you talked to Floyd,
took off your clothes--

889
00:53:46,155 --> 00:53:47,622
All right,
all right.

890
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,952
When you came in
after your walk with Carl,

891
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:51,993
he saw
everything.

892
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,563
Go to the police.
It was a setup.

893
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,598
I was murdered.

894
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:59,668
He says go to the police.
He was murdered.

895
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:00,997
There's somebody
else involved--

896
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,903
I don't want no more
to do with this.

897
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,497
Where are you going?

898
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:08,543
I'm leaving, I did everything
I said I'd do.

899
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:10,670
And don't be
following me.

900
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,680
I'm finished.
I mean it.

901
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,081
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death.

902
00:54:15,184 --> 00:54:16,173
Goodbye.

903
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:21,254
Molly, there is no one
on earth besides you

904
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,652
who wants this
to be true more than me,

905
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,025
but you got to be
rational about this.

906
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,190
Sam is no more
in this room than--

907
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:35,896
Look, I understand the
need to hang on to him,

908
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:38,974
I really do,
but this is absurd.

909
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:43,068
I know this seems absurd,
but it had to be real.

910
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,113
You believed some
fortune-teller from Brooklyn

911
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,172
who shows up
at your door?

912
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:50,184
I watched her have
a conversation with him.

913
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,550
I don't buy it, Moll,
not for a minute.

914
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:54,849
What about the things
she knew?

915
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,549
What things?

916
00:54:56,692 --> 00:55:00,287
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

917
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,155
Carl, we were alone.

918
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:05,723
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

919
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,498
She said Sam knew
who killed him.

920
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,906
Yeah, that he
was set up.

921
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:16,945
This is getting
deranged.

922
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,503
We're off
the deep end.

923
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:20,775
She had a name
and an address--

924
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,782
Willy Lopez.

925
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,183
303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

926
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:27,052
This is sick.

927
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:28,646
Oh, Carl.

928
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,725
This is really sick.

929
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:32,793
Oh, God.

930
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,260
Molly, I don't
understand

931
00:55:34,363 --> 00:55:36,263
how you could--
you could...

932
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,835
swallow this crap.
I mean...

933
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,269
this guy
may not even exist.

934
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:46,307
Maybe she's just
trying to use you

935
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,969
to set someone up.

936
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,080
You're right.

937
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,681
You're absolutely right.

938
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,683
That's what
I got to find out.

939
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:58,117
What do you mean,
find out?

940
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,314
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

941
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,956
Sam wants you to
go to the police?

942
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,824
Jesus, Moll. Are you
out of your mind?

943
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,228
What are you going
to tell the police?

944
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,822
That some
storefront psychic

945
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,232
has been communing
with the dead?

946
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,827
Do you know what
that sounds like?

947
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,237
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

948
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:20,940
I'm sorry.

949
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:23,807
This stuff just really
gets to me,

950
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:24,811
you know?

951
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,212
It's OK if you
don't believe me.

952
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:28,806
I'm trying to, Molly.

953
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,980
Look...

954
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:37,024
if it'll make you
feel any better,

955
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:41,256
I'll go check
this out, OK?

956
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:44,265
I want you to try
and get some sleep.

957
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,265
OK?

958
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:47,233
All right.

959
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,271
I'll call you
in the morning.

960
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:51,271
OK.

961
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,394
Be careful.

962
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,680
[Knock Knock]

963
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,215
Carl.

964
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,219
What the hell
are you doing here?

965
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,422
Who you been
talking to, Willy?

966
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,958
''Talking to''?
What the hell do you mean?

967
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,288
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

968
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,296
Where's she
getting it from?

969
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,855
I haven't said
a word to anybody.

970
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,299
She knows your name
and where you live.

971
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,837
A lot of women
know where I live.

972
00:57:55,938 --> 00:57:57,838
This is not a joke.

973
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,874
She knows
about the murder.

974
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,274
I want you
to find this bitch,

975
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,868
whoever she is,

976
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,880
and I want you to--

977
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,115
Just get rid
of her, OK?

978
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:14,713
I've got $4 million stuck
in a god damn computer.

979
00:58:14,857 --> 00:58:17,155
If I don't get
those codes,

980
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,161
if that money is not
transferred soon...

981
00:58:22,865 --> 00:58:24,355
I'm...

982
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,456
dead.

983
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:27,024
We're both dead.

984
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,400
Why not tell them
you only launder money

985
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:30,995
the first of the month?

986
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:32,904
What the hell
is wrong with you?

987
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,374
Is everything a joke?

988
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:37,172
You killed a man.

989
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,302
You were supposed
to steal his wallet.

990
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:40,881
-Was that a joke?
-I did you a favor.

991
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:42,314
That was a freebie.

992
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,750
Look, these are
drug dealers, OK?

993
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:49,221
Just don't blow this
for me.

994
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,159
I've risked my job.
I could go to jail.

995
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:55,424
$80,000 of that money
is mine.

996
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,029
Look, just...

997
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,798
let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

998
00:59:02,905 --> 00:59:05,465
I'll get the address book
myself, OK?

999
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,834
You god damn bastard!

1000
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:34,925
Why?

1001
00:59:35,037 --> 00:59:37,471
Why? You were
my friend!

1002
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:42,241
I had a life,
god damn you.

1003
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:44,039
I had a life!

1004
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,354
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

1005
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:57,926
But she was real.

1006
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:01,622
You think I'd come down here
if it wasn't real?

1007
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:03,623
You know,

1008
01:00:04,066 --> 01:00:07,365
you told me if I had
any new information

1009
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,960
that I should come.

1010
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:10,369
So here I am.

1011
01:00:14,543 --> 01:00:16,477
I know
how this sounds.

1012
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:18,479
I hear myself
saying it,

1013
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:20,481
and I want
to cringe.

1014
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:23,518
But this woman knew things
she couldn't have known.

1015
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:26,077
Things Sam
only said to me.

1016
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:29,214
OK, according to this
psychic lady,

1017
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,692
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place

1018
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:35,692
watching us
all the time?

1019
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:36,693
Huh?

1020
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:42,403
Hell, I'm never going
to get undressed again.

1021
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:43,403
Excuse me.

1022
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:46,407
I got more
important things to do.

1023
01:00:57,319 --> 01:00:59,583
The guy's name
is Willy Lopez.

1024
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:03,055
All I'm asking you to do
is check it out.

1025
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,523
OK. Wait here.

1026
01:01:04,593 --> 01:01:08,324
Let me see if the guy's
got a record, all right?

1027
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,160
Great.

1028
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:14,219
What are you doing?

1029
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,355
Where's the file
on Willy Lopez?

1030
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:17,955
There isn't one.

1031
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:19,967
He was probably
some old boyfriend

1032
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:22,367
she was trying
to get even with.

1033

This psychic woman's
got a record

01:02:24,473 --> 01:02:26,964

a long way.

Look,
this is impossible.

It goes on and on.

1044
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,263
She knew things,
private things.

1045
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:51,765
Now, how could she
have known all that?

1046
01:02:51,867 --> 01:02:54,358
A lot of times
they read the obits.

1047
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:57,701
She just had to see
the word ''banker''--boom.

Hell, they even go
through your...garbage

to find things
they can use--

1050
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:03,775
letters, old papers.

1051
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,344
It doesn't take much.

1052
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:07,346
No.

1053
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,042
It was real.

1054
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,747
She knew about a...

1055
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,355

People want so much
to believe.

1061
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:37,677
They're grieving,

1062
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,111
they're vulnerable...

1063
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:42,609
and they will
give anything

1064

what they're doing.

Wow. What
did you tell them?

01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:26,927
At least
1 0 inches thick.

1169
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,655
A ripoff artist, huh?

1170
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:30,823
No, Molly.

1171
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:34,534
You know,
the sad thing...

1172
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:38,105
is that
I believed her.

1173
01:09:38,206 --> 01:09:39,673
Molly...

1174
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:43,802
sometimes
we need to believe.

1175
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:46,745
Why? What's the point?

1176
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,214
Molly, it's not easy to face
the realities of life sometimes.

1177
01:09:50,652 --> 01:09:52,711
You got to
give yourself that.

1178
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:57,553
What you've got to remember
is the love that you guys felt.

1179
01:09:57,659 --> 01:09:59,991
You got to remember
how good Sam was.

1180
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:02,553
You were everything
to him, Molly.

1181
01:10:02,664 --> 01:10:03,995
You were his life.

1182
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,111
I feel so alone.

1183
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,155
You're not alone.

1184
01:10:30,258 --> 01:10:31,156
OK?

1185
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:34,927
You got your work.
You're incredibly talented.

1186
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,962
You're young.

1187
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:38,259
You're fantastically
gorgeous.

1188
01:10:39,968 --> 01:10:42,300
I don't know
what's real anymore.

1189
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:46,040
I don't know
what to think.

1190
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:50,972
Just think about Sam.

1191
01:10:53,648 --> 01:10:56,515
Think about the time
you guys had together.

1192
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,584
How wonderful that was.

1193
01:11:00,822 --> 01:11:01,948
Yeah.

1194
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:06,093
Let your feelings out,
Moll. It's OK.

1195
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:08,662
Life turns on a dime.

1196
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,154
You know?

1197
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:13,857
I mean...

1198
01:11:15,003 --> 01:11:16,561
people think that...

1199
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:19,697
they're there forever, that there's
always going to be tomorrow,

1200
01:11:19,841 --> 01:11:21,138
but that's bullshit.

1201
01:11:21,276 --> 01:11:23,210
Sam taught us that.

1202
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:27,045
You have to
live for now.

1203
01:11:29,684 --> 01:11:30,810
For today.

1204
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:51,804
I can't.

1205
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:52,805
I'm sorry.

1206
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:53,806
It's OK.

1207
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:56,604
I--I--I can't.
It's just too soon.

1208
01:11:56,711 --> 01:11:57,643
It's OK.

1209
01:11:57,712 --> 01:11:59,612
You've been great,
Carl.

1210
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,585
But I need you
to leave.

1211
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,950
I understand totally.

1212
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:06,986
Please.

1213
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:15,891
Could we just have dinner
tomorrow night? Just talk?

1214
01:12:15,997 --> 01:12:18,329
Can I interest you
in that?

1215
01:12:19,701 --> 01:12:20,725
Yeah.

1216
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:21,734
Sure.

1217
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:22,735
Great.

1218
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:31,937
Hey.

1219
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:39,010
Get off my train!

1220
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:40,012
No.

1221
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:41,878
Get off!

1222
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:42,974
Get off!

1223
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:43,880
Get off!

1224
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,249
Get off!

1225
01:13:45,353 --> 01:13:46,718
Get off!

1226
01:13:46,821 --> 01:13:47,947
Get out of here!

1227
01:13:48,089 --> 01:13:49,078
Get off!

1228
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,122
No.

1229
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:52,125
Show me
how you do that.

1230
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,457
I'm not leaving
till you teach me.

1231
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:55,696
Get off!

1232
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:56,854
No.

1233
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:57,863
Get off!

1234
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,374
You stubborn asshole.

1235
01:14:07,475 --> 01:14:08,965
Ha ha ha.

1236
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,408
What are you doing?

1237
01:14:10,478 --> 01:14:12,412
What the hell
are you doing?

1238
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,970
What am I doing?

1239
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,414
You're trying to move it
with your finger.

1240
01:14:16,484 --> 01:14:18,816
You can't push it.
You're dead.

1241
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,263
It's all in your mind.

1242
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:32,823
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

1243
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:34,834
You think you're
wearing those clothes?

1244
01:14:34,936 --> 01:14:37,166
You think you're crouched
on that floor?

1245
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:38,170
Bullshit!

1246
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:40,764
You ain't got a body
no more, son!

1247
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:42,206
It's all up here!

1248
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:43,800
You want
to move something,

1249
01:14:43,878 --> 01:14:46,210
you got to move it
with your mind!

1250
01:14:46,314 --> 01:14:47,804
You got to focus!

1251
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:49,816
How? How do you focus?

1252
01:14:49,884 --> 01:14:52,284
I don't know
how you focus.

1253
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,910
You just focus.

1254
01:14:57,225 --> 01:14:58,988
How did you do that?

1255
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,290
You got to take
all your emotions,

1256
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:04,093
all your anger, all your love,
all your hate,

1257
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:05,496
and push it way down

1258
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,359
into the pit
of your stomach

1259
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,960
and let it explode
like a reactor. Pow!

1260
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,139
OK.

1261
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:14,139
OK.

1262
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,739
Don't laugh.

1263
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:47,031
Way to go, kid.

1264
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,506
I did it.

1265
01:15:50,278 --> 01:15:51,802
I did it.

1266
01:15:51,946 --> 01:15:53,243
Way to go.

1267
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:03,122
From your gut,
like I told you.

1268
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:09,029
Give it time.
What else have you got?

1269
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:19,029
How long
have you been here?

1270
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:23,369
Since they pushed me.

1271
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:25,001
Someone pushed you?

1272
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,341
Yeah, someone pushed me.

1273
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:27,847
Who?

1274
01:16:27,949 --> 01:16:29,246
You don't believe me?

1275
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:32,218
You think I fell?
You think I jumped?

1276
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,787
Well, fuck you!

1277
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,412
It wasn't my time!

1278
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,457
I wasn't supposed to go!

1279
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:40,027
I'm not supposed
to be here!

1280
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:44,259
Oh.

1281
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:46,827
Oh.

1282
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:53,300
Oh, I'd give anything
for a drag.

1283
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:55,602
Just one drag.

1284
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,468
Are you all right?

1285
01:16:57,612 --> 01:17:00,240
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

1286
01:17:00,348 --> 01:17:02,316
Who sent you?

1287
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,183
Who sent you?

1288
01:17:08,356 --> 01:17:09,880
Leave me alone.

1289
01:17:10,024 --> 01:17:11,355
Leave me alone!

1290
01:17:11,459 --> 01:17:13,586
Leave me alone!

1291
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,139
Yes!

1292
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:14,988
You need
to concentrate,

1293
01:18:15,089 --> 01:18:16,420
'cause if
you concentrate,

1294
01:18:16,524 --> 01:18:17,991
you'll probably
rouse him.

1295
01:18:18,092 --> 01:18:19,423
What's his name
again?

1296
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:20,425
Orlando.

1297
01:18:20,528 --> 01:18:21,495
Orlando.

1298
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:24,462
Orlando. Orlando.
Is there an Orlando here?

1299
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:25,464
I'm here.

1300
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:26,465
He's here.

1301
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:27,899
Oda Mae, I--

1302
01:18:28,002 --> 01:18:28,900
Sam.

1303
01:18:29,003 --> 01:18:30,334
Excuse me.
I'm Orlando.

1304
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:31,895
The line's
over there.

1305
01:18:32,006 --> 01:18:33,906
Where did these ghosts
come from?

1306
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:35,373
You can hear them, too?

1307
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:38,378
I hear them in the morning
and the evening.

1308
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:40,073
They're coming
into the shower.

1309
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:43,184
Did you tell every spook
you met about me?

1310
01:18:43,284 --> 01:18:45,980
I got spooks from Jersey
coming in here.

1311
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,680
There's stuff going on
you wouldn't believe.

1312
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,724
It's amazing.
You're really doing it.

1313
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:51,754
I know.

1314
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:53,654
Can you
hurry this up?

1315
01:18:53,761 --> 01:18:55,991
Oh, chill out.
Chill out.

1316
01:18:56,097 --> 01:18:57,428
I need your help.

1317
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,433
There's something
we need to do.

1318
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,900
I'm not doing anything
else with you, Sam.

1319
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,903
You're holding on
to a life

1320
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:05,370
that doesn't
want you anymore.

1321
01:19:05,473 --> 01:19:07,634
It doesn't want you.
Give up the ghost.

1322
01:19:07,742 --> 01:19:09,676
Are you speaking
to me?

1323
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:11,678
Does it look like it?

1324
01:19:11,746 --> 01:19:14,374
You're supposed to be
concentrating, aren't you?

1325
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,006
You going to try it?

1326
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,278
Thank you very much.

1327
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,717
Sam, are you going
to get out of here?

1328
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:20,716
Uh-uh.

1329
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:22,320
Fine, then stay there.

1330
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:23,321
Excuse me.

1331
01:19:23,424 --> 01:19:24,322
Excuse me.

1332
01:19:24,425 --> 01:19:25,687
You ready now?

1333
01:19:25,793 --> 01:19:27,226
Let's do it.

1334
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:29,694
I got to talk
to you now.

1335
01:19:29,797 --> 01:19:31,264
I've got a plan.

1336
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:34,995
All we got to do
is we can...

1337
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,229
Oda Mae?

1338
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:44,439
Oda Mae.

1339
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:48,115
Ortisha?

1340
01:19:49,517 --> 01:19:51,485
Orlando. Is that you?

1341
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:54,522
Ortisha, where you at?
I can't hardly see.

1342
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:55,486
Here.
Sh-She's here.

1343
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:59,026
In front of you.
I'm right here.

1344
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:05,829
Damn, baby, what did
you do to your hair?

1345
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:09,502
Orlando, you like it?

1346
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:12,129
It's autumn sunrise.

1347
01:20:14,642 --> 01:20:18,134
Get out of me,
you son of a bitch.

1348
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:23,843
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

1349
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:25,211
Orlando?

1350
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:26,684
Ugh!

1351
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:29,256
I can barely move.

1352
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:31,187
You should know
better than that.

1353
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:33,317
Jumping into bodies
wipes you out.

1354
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:34,359
Everybody out.

1355
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,759
What happened
to Orlando?

1356
01:20:35,863 --> 01:20:38,388
Where's
the insurance policy?

1357
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:39,830
Are you deaf?

1358
01:20:39,934 --> 01:20:42,300
I said everybody out!

1359
01:20:42,403 --> 01:20:43,563
Everybody out!

1360
01:20:43,671 --> 01:20:45,161
Get out! Get out!

1361
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:46,604
Everybody get out!

1362
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:00,180
Get out.

1363
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:01,550
You the fortune-teller?

1364
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:03,156
Who are you?

1365
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:04,588
That's an interesting
question.

1366
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:07,454
Why don't you tell me?

1367
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:08,586
Willy.

1368
01:21:08,696 --> 01:21:10,095
Willy?

1369
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,790
Prospect Place Willy?

1370
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:13,799
Get out of here fast.

1371
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,841
Oda Mae!
Sister! Sister!

1372
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,916
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1373
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,688
We're in trouble,
so you got to help.

1374
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:39,692
What do you mean we?
You're already dead.

1375
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,194
These people
are trying to kill me.

1376
01:21:42,296 --> 01:21:43,627
And they'll be back.

1377
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:46,633
Why don't you just find
a house to haunt?

1378
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:49,192
Get some chains and
rattle them or something.

1379
01:21:49,303 --> 01:21:51,464
I have a plan,
and it will work,

1380
01:21:51,572 --> 01:21:53,403
but get some
of your fake I.D.s.

1381
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:54,702
Forget it.

1382
01:21:54,842 --> 01:21:58,278
If you do this, they'll
never bother you again.

1383
01:22:03,284 --> 01:22:04,376
Scout's honor.

1384
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,210
All right.

1385
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:08,913
What do I have to do?

1386
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:11,124
What exactly
do I have to do?

1387
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,794
You got a nice dress?

1388
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:20,462
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

1389
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:23,868
Sorry. I made a joke.
I love your shoes.

1390
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:26,462
I don't know anything
about banking.

1391
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,873
Oda Mae, would
you just relax?

1392
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,500
Listen, I'm nervous.

1393
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,512
I'll get you
through it.

1394
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,946
Your fake driver's
license is great.

1395
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:38,515
Oh, Sam. I don't think
I should do this.

1396
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:41,588
Straight ahead.
A stairway that says new accounts.

1397
01:22:41,689 --> 01:22:43,589
I ain't giving
them money.

1398
01:22:43,691 --> 01:22:45,625
Do what I say.
Don't talk.

1399
01:22:46,694 --> 01:22:48,025
Tell her you're here

1400
01:22:48,262 --> 01:22:51,595
to fill out a signature
card for a new account.

1401
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:55,965
I'm here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

1402
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:57,970
Do you know
your account number?

1403
01:22:58,072 --> 01:22:59,630
926-31 043.

1404
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:00,503
926...

1405
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:01,506
31 043.

1406
01:23:01,642 --> 01:23:03,337
31 043.

1407
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:05,877
Rita Miller.

1408
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,878
Who?

1409
01:23:06,981 --> 01:23:07,879
Rita Miller.

1410
01:23:07,982 --> 01:23:08,914
Rita Miller.

1411
01:23:09,016 --> 01:23:10,506
Didn't you sign a card

1412
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:11,882
when you opened
the account?

1413
01:23:12,019 --> 01:23:14,510
Carl Bruner opened it
for you by phone

1414
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:16,522
and asked you
to come in today.

1415
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,388
Carl Bruner opened it
for me by phone.

1416
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:21,587
Now he's asked me
to come in today.

1417
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:24,228
Is that right?

1418
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,799
Yeah.

1419
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:31,736
All right.Just sign this
card on the bottom line, please.

1420
01:23:31,839 --> 01:23:34,740
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

1421
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:41,981
No, no, no!
Rita Miller.

1422
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:44,415
I'm so sorry.

1423
01:23:44,485 --> 01:23:45,850
You know, I...

1424
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:48,786
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

1425
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,993
Make sure it goes up to
the third floor file

1426
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:59,589
because you have
a transaction to make.

1427
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:02,464
Make sure this goes
to the third floor file.

1428
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,936
I have a transfusion
to make.

1429
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:05,904
A what?

1430
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,531
Let's go.

1431
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:10,907
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

1432
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:12,980
Uh...uh,
yes, sure.

1433
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:14,805
Thank you so much.

1434
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:18,818
Bye-bye. I just
love these pens.

1435
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:22,412
What do you want to
keep the pen for?

1436
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:23,455
[Ring]

1437
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:24,889
Carl Bruner speaking.

1438
01:24:24,992 --> 01:24:26,459
Hi, Carl.

1439
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:27,459
Mr. Balistrari.

1440
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:30,497
Balistrari? Carl,
it's me,John.

1441
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:34,899
John.John, sorry, um,
what--what-- what--what's up?

1442
01:24:35,002 --> 01:24:37,493
I've got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

1443
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:38,470
Oh, right.

1444
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,905
I'll pick it up
later, all right?

1445
01:24:41,008 --> 01:24:42,703
I'll be here
till 6:00.

1446
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:51,515
I don't suppose I can
talk you into losing the hat.

1447
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:52,950
You keep
messing with me,

1448
01:24:53,087 --> 01:24:54,520
you'll be here
by yourself.

1449
01:24:54,655 --> 01:24:59,961
Shh. Now tell the guard
you're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

1450
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:02,794
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

1451
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:04,831
Do you have
an appointment?

1452
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:06,833
No, I'm here
for my health.

1453
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,835
Tell him Rita
Miller's here.

1454
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:11,394
You--You just tell him
Rita Miller's here.

1455
01:25:11,505 --> 01:25:12,403
One moment.

1456
01:25:12,506 --> 01:25:13,404
Don't embellish.

1457
01:25:13,507 --> 01:25:14,940
Jawohl.

1458
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:16,475
Excuse me?

1459
01:25:20,114 --> 01:25:22,605
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.

1460
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:24,617
I've known him
for five years,

1461
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,619
and he still
thinks my name's--

1462
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:28,016
Why are you
whispering?

1463
01:25:28,155 --> 01:25:30,316
Just be quiet
and listen.

1464
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,789
He's a social moron.

1465
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:34,589
Just tell the guard
Ferguson knows you.

1466
01:25:34,695 --> 01:25:37,596
You spent time with him
and his wife Shirley

1467
01:25:37,698 --> 01:25:40,599
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year. Got it?

1468
01:25:40,701 --> 01:25:42,726
What is this
in regards to?

1469
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,737
What? He doesn't
remember me?

1470
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:46,739
Oh, we spent
all that time

1471
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:50,072
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year.

1472
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:51,701
It was beautiful.

1473
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:54,748
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere.

1474
01:25:54,815 --> 01:25:55,747
It--

1475
01:25:57,685 --> 01:25:59,050
Gas.

1476
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:03,021
I get a little gas
from time to time.

1477
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:04,557
That's all. Gas.

1478
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:06,990
Quit poking me!

1479
01:26:07,094 --> 01:26:08,527
Well,
don't overdo it.

1480
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,563
Now, listen.
This'll be easy.

1481
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:13,759
Ferguson was so drunk,
he could've had a conversation

1482
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:16,098
with Tina Turner
and not remember.

1483
01:26:20,474 --> 01:26:22,135
I don't know, Sam.

1484
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:23,740
Here we go.

1485
01:26:27,114 --> 01:26:28,046
Hello. Hello.

1486
01:26:28,115 --> 01:26:29,480
Uh, yes.

1487
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:32,575
Of course, yes.

1488
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:35,155
Well, uh, it's been
a...a long time.

1489
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:36,150
Long time.

1490
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:38,789
Ask how Bobby
and Snooky are doing.

1491
01:26:38,859 --> 01:26:40,793
How are Bobby
and Snooky doing?

1492
01:26:40,861 --> 01:26:43,421
Fine. Fine.
Thank you.

1493
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:44,862
Thank you
for asking.

1494
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:49,801
Uh, and how is
your, uh, family?

1495
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,997
Oh, couldn't
be better.

1496
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:53,664
Well...wonderful.

1497
01:26:53,774 --> 01:26:55,674
Tell him you've
been wondering

1498
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:58,142
how they did on the
Gibraltar securities.

1499
01:26:58,212 --> 01:26:59,702
I was just wondering,

1500
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:02,578
how did you do on
the Gibraltar securities?

1501
01:27:02,683 --> 01:27:03,945
The Gibraltar
securities?

1502
01:27:04,051 --> 01:27:07,919
Well, it looks like we topped out
on that one, huh?

1503
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:08,921
Sure did.

1504
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:09,922
Sure did.

1505
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:11,788
That was
a useful tip.

1506
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,019
Good old Randy.

1507
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:15,994
Good old Randy. Got a
good old head on his shoulders.

1508
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:17,223
Her shoulders.

1509
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:18,829
Her shoulders.

1510
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:19,922
Randy.

1511
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:22,469
So, what, um...

1512
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,003
what brings you
here today?

1513
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:25,595
You're closing
an account.

1514
01:27:25,706 --> 01:27:27,037
I'm closing an account.

1515
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:29,837
Do you have
your account number?

1516
01:27:29,977 --> 01:27:30,841
Yes?

1517
01:27:30,978 --> 01:27:31,876
Yes.

1518
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:32,877
Yes.

1519
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:33,878
926-31 043.

1520
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:36,745
926-31 043.
Is that right?

1521
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:37,749
Yeah.

1522
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,046
Good.

1523
01:27:47,194 --> 01:27:50,686
Well, Rita, it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

1524
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,960
$4 million
from us today.

1525
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:54,534
$4 million!

1526
01:27:54,635 --> 01:27:56,535
Say yes. Say yes!

1527
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:57,536
Is that correct?

1528
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:58,537
Yes.

1529
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:00,870
Yes.
Yes, uh, yes!

1530
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:02,772
Yes, that's correct.

1531
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:04,469
Easy, easy.

1532
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:09,709
Yes. Well, how
would you like that?

1533
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:11,785
1 0s and 20s.

1534
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:12,818
Pardon?

1535
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,512
Tell him
a cashier's check.

1536
01:28:14,655 --> 01:28:16,987
I think better
a cashier's check.

1537
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:18,888
A cashier's check.
Fine.

1538
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:20,893
Well, of course,
uh, you know,

1539
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:22,895
we require identification
from everyone.

1540
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:24,487
Oh, I see.

1541
01:28:24,598 --> 01:28:25,895
It's just
procedural.

1542
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,695
Yes. I...

1543
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:38,306
Thank you.

1544
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:41,047
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll be right back.

1545
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:44,147
$4 million!

1546
01:28:44,251 --> 01:28:45,149
Shh!

1547
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:53,123
Yeah, get me the
First Island Bank of Nassau.

1548
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:54,627
It's on the Rolodex.

1549
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:08,532
Well, we have some, uh,
things for you to sign here.

1550
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:11,578
This officially
closes the account.

1551
01:29:11,645 --> 01:29:13,579
And, uh,
here you are.

1552
01:29:13,647 --> 01:29:14,978
Now sign Rita Miller.

1553
01:29:15,082 --> 01:29:16,174
Mm-hmm.

1554
01:29:17,651 --> 01:29:21,087
Rita Miller.
That's my name.

1555
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:25,056
My name. Rita Miller.
My name.

1556
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:27,559
That's my name.

1557
01:29:27,661 --> 01:29:28,559
Molly, hi.

1558
01:29:28,662 --> 01:29:29,560
Hi.

1559
01:29:29,663 --> 01:29:32,791
Oda Mae,
I'll be right back.

1560
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,162
Just anywhere?

1561
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:35,166
Right here.

1562
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:36,167
Right.

1563
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:42,234
Fine.

1564
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:44,777
The, uh, check.

1565
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,080
This, uh--

1566
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:49,945
Here you are.

1567
01:29:50,017 --> 01:29:53,953
The person you need
is right down on the end.

1568
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:01,060
Mama took the money that
she made in the oil wells,

1569
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:03,653
and she sunk it
into gas pumps.

1570
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,426
You know, how they have
at the gas station?

1571
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:08,658
It's very,
very lucrative.

1572
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:09,668
Oda Mae...

1573
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:11,068
it really adds up.

1574
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:12,730
Say goodbye.

1575
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,172
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1576
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:17,972
Now, may I keep the pen?

1577
01:30:18,078 --> 01:30:21,104
Say good night to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

1578
01:30:21,248 --> 01:30:22,146
Bye-bye.

1579
01:30:22,249 --> 01:30:24,149
Why are you
rushing me?

1580
01:30:28,522 --> 01:30:30,353
What is wrong?

1581
01:30:31,825 --> 01:30:32,917
Oh.

1582
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:41,164
Excuse me. Lyle?

1583
01:30:41,268 --> 01:30:42,735
Oh, yes. Uh...

1584
01:30:42,803 --> 01:30:43,735
Molly.

1585
01:30:43,804 --> 01:30:45,396
Molly.

1586
01:30:45,472 --> 01:30:47,736
Jensen. The woman you were
just doing business with...

1587
01:30:47,841 --> 01:30:48,773
Yeah?

1588
01:30:48,842 --> 01:30:50,173
What did she want?

1589
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:52,779
Did it have anything
to do with Sam?

1590
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,110
Sam? Why, no. No.

1591
01:30:55,182 --> 01:30:57,514
That was Oda Mae Brown,
right?

1592
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,514
No. Her name
was Rita Miller.

1593
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:01,310
She was closing
an account.

1594
01:31:01,455 --> 01:31:02,820
Is there a problem?

1595
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:07,650
No, I guess not.
Thank you.

1596
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:39,716
Carl,
is something wrong?

1597
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,158
Is somebody playing
with the computers?

1598
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:43,161
What?

1599
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:45,164
One of my accounts
is closed.

1600
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:46,756
Which account?
What's wrong?

1601
01:31:46,867 --> 01:31:49,165
You want me
to call someone?

1602
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,760
No, it's OK.

1603
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:52,839
I can do it.
I got it.

1604
01:31:56,076 --> 01:31:57,373
$4 million!

1605
01:31:57,511 --> 01:32:00,480
What am I going to
do with this money?

1606
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:02,510
I'm going
to buy the block.

1607
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:06,514
I'm going to make my sister
go to a fat farm.

1608
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:09,152
I'm going to
buy the building.

1609
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:10,554
I've got an idea.

1610
01:32:10,824 --> 01:32:11,552
Please donate.

1611
01:32:11,825 --> 01:32:14,419
Take the check
out of your purse.

1612
01:32:14,561 --> 01:32:17,997
Right. I should put it
where nobody can get it.

1613
01:32:18,098 --> 01:32:19,429
No. No. Endorse it.

1614
01:32:19,533 --> 01:32:22,434
If I endorse it,
then if I drop it,

1615
01:32:22,536 --> 01:32:24,026
somebody will get it.

1616
01:32:24,104 --> 01:32:27,096
I never said you were
going to get the money.

1617
01:32:27,207 --> 01:32:30,005
It's blood money.
I was killed for this money.

1618
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:31,475
Now,
endorse the check.

1619
01:32:31,578 --> 01:32:34,138
What are you going
to do with it?

1620
01:32:35,849 --> 01:32:37,214
Look over there.

1621
01:32:37,284 --> 01:32:39,878
To your left.

1622
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:45,387
You don't think
I'm giving this $4 million

1623
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:47,393
to a bunch of nuns.

1624
01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:49,929
If you don't,
they'll track you down.

1625
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,395
Get rid of it.

1626
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:53,057
Sam,
you're killing me!

1627
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,498
It's $4 million!

1628
01:32:54,601 --> 01:32:56,034
You'll go to heaven.

1629
01:32:56,136 --> 01:32:58,434
I don't want
to go to heaven.

1630
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,837
I want to
cash the check.

1631
01:33:03,977 --> 01:33:04,841
Hello.

1632
01:33:04,978 --> 01:33:06,309
You'll thank me
later.

1633
01:33:06,413 --> 01:33:07,971
How are you
doing?

1634
01:33:09,616 --> 01:33:11,550
Now, endorse it
''Rita Miller.''

1635
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:12,547
I know.

1636
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:15,550
Make it out
to St.Joseph's shelter.

1637
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:18,586
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

1638
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:25,598
Now give it to her.

1639
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:28,157
I want to feel it
one more time.

1640
01:33:28,268 --> 01:33:30,168
Give the lady
the check.

1641
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:31,168
I will!

1642
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:34,197
Hand her the check.

1643
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:36,333
You can do it.

1644
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:39,609
Give her the check.

1645
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,643
I will!

1646
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:47,454
Bless you, child.
Bless you.

1647
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,157
Give it to her.

1648
01:33:55,229 --> 01:33:58,130
Let go. Let go!

1649
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:00,097
Shit.

1650
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:06,503
I'm proud of you,
Oda Mae.

1651
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:10,099
I don't care. Stay away
from me from now on.

1652
01:34:10,177 --> 01:34:13,112
What is that nun going
to do with it?

1653
01:34:13,213 --> 01:34:16,114
Leave me alone.
Never talk to me again.

1654
01:34:16,216 --> 01:34:18,150
I think you're

What?

1817

Push a penny
under the door.

1818
01:45:53,813 --> 01:45:55,713
Push a penny
under the door?

I'd give anything

if I could just
touch you once more.

my body.

Use your body?
