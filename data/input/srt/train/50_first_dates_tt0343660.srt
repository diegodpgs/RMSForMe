1
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:54,235
So tell me. How was Hawaii?

2
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:57,772
- It was unbelievable.
- Oh, yeah?

3
00:00:58,216 --> 00:01:00,741
- Well, what happened?
- I met this guy.

4
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:03,312
It was the best week of my life.

5
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,588
It was just a little
vacation romance.

6
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:08,589
But he was so sweet.

7
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:11,058
He took me to all these
cool local places.

8
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:13,527
We went scuba diving...

9
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:16,097
- Snorkeling.
- Mountain climbing.

10
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:18,685
We went cliff diving.

11
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:23,088
Well, we got a little drunk.

12
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:25,556
- He gave me...
- A back rub.

13
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:26,990
We slow danced...

14
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:28,594
...in the rain.

15
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:30,789
But it wasn't just about the sex.

16
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:34,225
He pounded me like a mallard duck.

17
00:01:35,203 --> 00:01:37,137
It ended kind of weird, though.

18
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:39,469
When I asked for his number,
he said he's...

19
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:40,969
- Married.
- Gay.

20
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,871
- Entering the priesthood.
- He doesn't believe in phones.

21
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:47,613
He just kind of ran away.

22
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:50,206
You know, it was just
a little fling, but...

23
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:51,708
I won't forget my week...

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,619
...with Henry Roth.

25
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:56,417
- Henry Roth.
- Harry.

26
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,192
Harry Paratesticles.

27
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:01,325
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,424
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

29
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:06,962
Henry Roth, why didn't you tell me
you were a secret agent?

30
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:11,899
I prefer intelligence operative,
and I couldn't tell you until I knew you.

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,208
Well, can I call you when I land?

32
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:17,973
You can call me, but I'll be in Peru.
I said that a little loud.

33
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:21,704
Come on, that's a 187, code blue.
We got the wolf sleeping at night.

34
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,584
He's slipping his arm in the drawer
and out comes the cookie jar. All clear.

35
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:28,517
Got it?

36
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:31,691
Well, maybe when you
get back from Peru.

37
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,286
- I don't think that's an option, Lisa.
- Linda.

38
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:39,130
I know. I changed your name
for your protection.

39
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:43,101
We have to go our separate ways now.

40
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:45,762
Well, goodbye.

41
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:47,604
Got it! Moving out!

42
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:55,715
- What the hell is your problem?
- Just keep going, I'll give you $20.

43
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:59,981
- You got it. How's your balls?
- Killing me. Hit it.

44
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:17,032
Easy, Honah Lee.

45
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:20,399
Hey, I'm a person, not a seal.

46
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:26,303
Well, I am a vet, not a doctor. So just
hold still, or I won't give you a treat.

47
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:28,179
I know, it's okay.
You see that, kids?

48
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:31,342
You see what happens
when you play with sharks?

49
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,311
Now, why you gotta spread those lies?
Sharks are like dogs.

50
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:37,951
They only bite when you
touch their private parts.

51
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,318
That's a good title
for my documentary.

52
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,390
Sharks: They Only Bite When
You Touch Their Private Parts.

53
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:49,428
Or you could call it,
Sharks: They Tried to Eat My Kidney.

54
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,704
All right, enough already.
You too, Willie.

55
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:56,901
All of you.

56
00:03:57,345 --> 00:03:58,835
He just cast a spell on us.

57
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:03,249
All right. Put this on four times
a day for two weeks.

58
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:06,252
- You can handle that.
- What's wrong with that turtle?

59
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:09,152
Lung problems because
he smoked too much turtle weed...

60
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:11,416
...which is bad for you. Right, Ula?

61
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:14,293
What? I don't smoke weed.

62
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:19,265
Hey, Honah Lee? How's that hot
wahine nympho from Ohio?

63
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:22,063
Great. I dropped her off
at the airport this morning.

64
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,836
Come on, I need some details.

65
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:27,034
You get some booby, some assy,
a pull on your poi-poi? Come on.

66
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,036
Daddy, what's a nympho?

67
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:33,506
Oh. The nympho
is the state bird of Ohio.

68
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:37,544
You're the state idiot of Hawaii.

69
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:41,184
Here you go. Bite the fish,
chew the fish, love the fish. Enjoy.

70
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,187
- You crack me up, kamaaina.
- Oh, yeah?

71
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:45,290
- One of these days...
- Yeah?

72
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:48,691
...you'll show one of those
tourists such a good time...

73
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,363
...she'll wanna stay on the island.

74
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:52,332
Why do you say
mean things like that...

75
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,391
...and why is your foot
on my pillow?

76
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:59,532
I don't want your ass on it, either.
Get up! Get up!

77
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,374
It could happen.

78
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:04,276
Then you won't be able to go
on your boat trip to Alaska.

79
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:11,215
You'll be stuck here, waking up next to
the same old, ugly broad, just like Ula.

80
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:18,722
- Just kidding, guys.
- About the old part or the ugly part?

81
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:24,023
Henry, come quickly!
It's Jocko!

82
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:33,202
Jocko! What's going on
with you, buddy?

83
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:36,308
Don't be scared.
Everything's gonna be fine.

84
00:05:36,444 --> 00:05:38,810
Just stay calm. All right.

85
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:43,042
Willie, I don't need you to see this.
Get out of here, now!

86
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,976
Okay, check the temperature
of the pool. Go! Hurry!

87
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:51,016
What are you doing?
I meant check the thermometer!

88
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,017
Give me a hand. Let's go!

89
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,725
Get me two fish
from the barrel. Now.

90
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,294
- Okay.
- Just hang in there.

91
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:59,399
- Here.
- It's gonna be all right.

92
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:02,527
That's a little warm.
Go to the bottom of the barrel, please.

93
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:11,672
Okay, there. That's good. Thank you.

94
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,446
Come on, buddy, take it. Take it.

95
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:15,472
- He's not responding!
- I know, Alexa!

96
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:18,969
Sorry, I smacked you. You needed
the fish-slap to calm down.

97
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,955
- Do you understand? Are you calm?
- Yes. Fish-slap calm me.

98
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:24,389
I'm gonna try to get him
breathing manually...

99
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:28,189
...so I need your face next
to his mouth to see if it's working.

100
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:29,428
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

101
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,363
- One, two, three!
- Nothing, nothing!

102
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,937
All right! Try it again. If it doesn't
work we'll perform a tracheotomy.

103
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:40,201
We don't wanna do that, so let's
pray this works. One more time.

104
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:42,533
One, two...

105
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,986
That's a lot of vomit.

106
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:57,354
This is why I got into
this business.

107
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:59,618
To save sea animals.

108
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:01,961
You should go
wash yourself off, okay?

109
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,522
Maybe try some turpentine.
That might take the stink away.

110
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,503
Yeah, high-five is right, buddy.

111
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:13,837
I knew you were gonna burp,
but the vomit thing was awesome!

112
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,238
That's what she gets for eating
my roast beef sandwich.

113
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:18,807
Willie, did you see that?

114
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:42,798
Captain's log:
November 5th, 6: 45 a. m.

115
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,369
I've taken the Sea Serpent for
a trip around the island of Oahu.

116
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:49,475
It is by far the longest voyage
she has yet undertaken...

117
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:52,239
...and its completion will signal
that she's ready...

118
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,547
...for our great journey
to Bristol Bay...

119
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:58,074
...whose unspoiled walrus habitat
will yield an abundance of...

120
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:08,084
Damn it!

121
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,223
Are you kidding me?

122
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:31,915
Aloha, honey.
What can I get for you?

123
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,610
I guess I'll take a cup of coffee.

124
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:37,590
- You guess?
- Yeah, I already ate breakfast.

125
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,322
I need to kill some time before the
Coast Guard gets here to tow my boat.

126
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:42,891
What did you eat?

127
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,793
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
and some Gatorade.

128
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:50,160
They're not breakfast.
I get you Spam and eggs.

129
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:52,503
Nick, I need Spam and eggs.

130
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,767
Hey.

131
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:58,407
- You like the peanut butter cups?
- Yes.

132
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:01,012
Want me to put peanut butter cups
in your eggs?

133
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,480
No, that's okay.

134
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:06,347
Peanut butter cups.

135
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,470
- Hey, Sue, nice haircut.
- Mahalo, Lucy.

136
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:01,173
Are you staring at me or her?

137
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,199
Because you're starting
to freak me out.

138
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:07,612
Settle down and eat your pancakes.

139
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:14,483
I think she's a local girl.
I wanted to go up to her...

140
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:17,987
...but I was kind of off my game.
But, man, was she cute, though.

141
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:20,250
I thought you liked your bitches
from out of state.

142
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:24,494
Yeah, that's usually my policy.
Make sure I don't get tied down.

143
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:27,132
Freeze that image right there.

144
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:31,535
There's the little fella.
Congratulations, Mommy.

145
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:35,971
Sounds to me like someone
is afraid of commitment.

146
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:37,710
Let me guess.

147
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:40,213
Your high school sweetheart
got drunk at party...

148
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:43,375
...then cheated on you
with whole wrestling team.

149
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:46,948
Close. Actually, it was my
college girlfriend Tracy.

150
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:50,222
And it wasn't a wrestling team.
It was her academic advisor.

151
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:54,284
- Oh, she liked the older man.
- Older women. About 50 years older.

152
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,422
I hope you shot the stupid tramp.

153
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:59,130
What's with the "tramp"
and the "bitches" talk?

154
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:02,861
- Are you drunk or something?
- I apologize for nasty talk.

155
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,637
I am grouchy due to lack
of recent physical intimacy.

156
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,641
Shut up, because here comes
one-time-only opportunity.

157
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:14,646
What I will do now is go into
your office and become naked.

158
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:18,411
Next move is up to you.

159
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,686
I may not be as limber
as I once was...

160
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:27,284
...but I make up for it with enthusiasm
and willingness to experiment.

161
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:31,731
I don't know if you realize,
I'm not into guys.

162
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:53,285
Hey, Mr. Peanut Butter Cups.

163
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,948
Hey, Mr. Could-Kill-Me-in-One-Punch.
How you doing?

164
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:58,985
- You're back.
- Couldn't get enough of that Spam.

165
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,919
Fry some up and throw
some eggs on it.

166
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:02,886
- You got it.
- All right, mahalo.

167
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,628
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi, Nick.

168
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:22,315
You know, why don't you try this?

169
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:27,946
It's kind of a hinge.

170
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:34,054
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- Well, you're too close to the project.

171
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,692
Don't be hard on yourself.

172
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:38,627
Right. Sometimes you need
an outsider's perspective.

173
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,595
Fresh eye never hurts.

174
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,132
I'm Lucy.

175
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:45,804
Yes. I'm Henry Roth.

176
00:12:45,873 --> 00:12:47,704
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

177
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,935
It's pretty. Keep up the good work.

178
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,179
Wait. I see you're sitting there alone.
Do you wanna come and sit down?

179
00:12:56,884 --> 00:13:01,150
- Sure, that'd be great, if that's all right.
- Okay.

180
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:08,259
- So are you an architect?
- I am not. I'm in fish.

181
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:10,362
Oh, that's where the smell
is coming from.

182
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:13,059
Yeah, yeah, I was feeding
a walrus this morning...

183
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,234
...and I thought I got most of it
off of me, but guess I didn't.

184
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:20,339
- I love that smell.
- No, you don't.

185
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:23,740
- Fish don't even like that smell.
- No, I do. My dad's a fisherman.

186
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:27,847
He and my brother Doug, they go
out to sea for months at a time.

187
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:31,942
And I miss them so much while they're
gone that when they come back...

188
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,787
...I just hold on to them
for five minutes each.

189
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:43,692
And they smell just like your hands.
It's the best smell in the world.

190
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:46,228
Well, my fingers are available...

191
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:49,163
...for your sniffing pleasure
anytime you need them.

192
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:51,905
- Wanna?
- Okay.

193
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:04,850
Sea lions are known
for their athleticism...

194
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:07,386
...and dolphins are known
for their intelligence.

195
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:11,924
- Walruses are known for their...
- Tusks?

196
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,898
Their tusks. Also their male parts
can get pretty gigantic.

197
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:22,629
Yeah, yeah, it's the second biggest
out of all the mammals.

198
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,928
- What's the first?
- I think Tattoo-Face.

199
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:32,639
I like your laugh.

200
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,947
I like you making me laugh.

201
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:37,849
I hate to break this up,
but we're setting up for lunch.

202
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:41,113
Oh, okay. Sorry, Sue.

203
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:45,356
And the real cool thing about walruses
is they're very mysterious.

204
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:47,722
- Mysterious?
- Yeah, yeah.

205
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:50,462
We don't really know what
they're like in the wild.

206
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,728
Don't they just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time?

207
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:56,868
All we really see is what they do
outside of the water...

208
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:59,529
...but who knows what
they do under the ice...

209
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,305
...where they spend
two-thirds of their lives.

210
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:07,208
Well, maybe they're intimidating the
other creatures with their big winkies.

211
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,175
That is one theory.

212
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:12,849
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

213
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,717
It's my dad's birthday, and we go
every year and we pick a pineapple.

214
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:20,790
- It's a tradition.
- That sounds nice. Okay, well...

215
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:22,518
...I had a great time.

216
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,622
- Me too.
- Okay.

217
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:29,332
Would you like to have breakfast
again tomorrow morning, same time?

218
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:31,936
- Because I teach an art class at 10.
- Really?

219
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,631
- Yeah.
- I wish I could make it...

220
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,565
...but, yes, I will be there.

221
00:15:37,544 --> 00:15:39,205
- Take care.
- Okay.

222
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:42,709
- One for the road. It is fishy.
- Got you good.

223
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:43,948
- Aloha.
- Aloha!

224
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:45,985
See you tomorrow.

225
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,715
Oh, my God.

226
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:52,150
Oh, my goodness.

227
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:03,695
Shit.

228
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:07,199
I had a bee on me.

229
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:09,906
- All right.
- He was a big one.

230
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,675
Which means
"look at those two shitheads. "

231
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:26,889
That was the stupidest-looking
swing I've ever seen.

232
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:29,426
I'm gonna take a Molokai
on that one.

233
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:32,064
No throwing. Come on.

234
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:35,261
Stop laughing, you hyenas.
Let's see what you get.

235
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:37,434
Okay, you heard me. Go! Go!

236
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:39,196
Show papa what you got.

237
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:54,178
- You suck, you're good at everything.
- Father of the Year strikes again.

238
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:59,752
By the way, cuz, I met this sexy, blond
tax attorney at Starbucks today.

239
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:03,892
I told her you the kahuna
she wanna have fun on this island.

240
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:05,894
You want her number?

241
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,862
You pimping tourists for me again?

242
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:10,797
Yes! I live vicariously
through you, remember?

243
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:12,104
My life sucks.

244
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:15,370
Now, come on. Give her the Waikikiki
sneaky between the cheeky.

245
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:21,080
Ula needs it. I imagine I did it and then
I can get through another weekend.

246
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:23,412
I'm staying in. Sorry.
Thank you, though.

247
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,379
- What?
- Hey, Dad!

248
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:27,643
Not now, Keanu Mokokokakau.

249
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:29,212
But your stitches are bleeding.

250
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:33,421
It must've been my huge back-swing.

251
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,788
You think you can stitch me up
after I get back from surfing?

252
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:40,691
- Yeah, looking forward to it.
- I wouldn't surf with a wound like that.

253
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,032
You might attract a shark.

254
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,865
What's wrong with that?
Sharks are naturally peaceful.

255
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:48,164
Is that right?
How'd you get that nasty cut, anyway?

256
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,642
A shark bit me.

257
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,643
Nice.

258
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:53,703
Go smoke another one, bro.

259
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:56,376
That shark theory's
starting to catch on.

260
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:57,946
Now, will everybody keep it down...

261
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:01,177
...while I whack the crap
out of this thing?

262
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,786
Sit! Stay! Shit! No!

263
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,726
Where the hell is it?

264
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:19,171
Looking for something?

265
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:28,704
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

266
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:31,878
The same thing you are.
Looking for my ball.

267
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:36,587
This is weird. I've been thinking
about you all morning, all day.

268
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:38,918
Can't wait to have breakfast
with you again.

269
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:42,195
I know. And I just wanna eat you up.

270
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:45,665
- Really?
- Yeah. Tomorrow and the next day...

271
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,633
- ... and the next day and the next day.
- All right. Okay.

272
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,203
Oh, my.

273
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:54,503
Oh, Lucy, that feels so good.

274
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:59,144
No, my nipples are too sensitive.
Stop that.

275
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,275
- What happened?
- Your ball hooked into that cart...

276
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:10,120
...bounced back and hit you in
the head. It was freaking hilarious.

277
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:12,247
- What?
- Who's Lucy?

278
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,023
And what's up with your nipples?

279
00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:20,631
I can't be falling for a local.
I ain't ever going back to that diner.

280
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,531
- This where you got hit?
- Yes!

281
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:33,234
You're so lucky you're a professional
cliff diver in Hawaii.

282
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,771
- Yeah, well, it's a living.
- I'm a tax attorney.

283
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:38,478
- We never get to have any fun.
- Is that right?

284
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:44,121
I'd like to do something
extra fun tonight.

285
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,666
Taking it deep, aren't you?

286
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:03,258
How about another
fishbowl for the lady?

287
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:05,710
- Why don't I just tap a keg for her?
- Okay.

288
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:09,281
I think I'm getting kind of drunk.

289
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:12,012
- Are you getting drunk?
- Getting there.

290
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,584
So, what are you thinking?

291
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:21,418
What am I thinking?

292
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:27,664
Actually, I'm not drunk at all,
Noreen, and neither are you...

293
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:31,167
...because there's no alcohol
in these drinks.

294
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:34,329
Sadly, I've used this technique
many times.

295
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:36,605
It helps lovely tourists,
such as yourself...

296
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:39,971
...loosen up without impairing
your ability to stay awake...

297
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:43,373
...and have guilt-free,
vigorous sex with me.

298
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:45,909
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

299
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:50,084
I'm not a cliff diver, either.
I'm afraid of heights.

300
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,848
Well, since it's my last night in town...

301
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,662
...can I pretend you didn't just say that
and still have sex with you anyway?

302
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:01,994
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

303
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:06,135
Well, can you at least point me in
the direction of someone who can?

304
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:09,398
That guy over there
could help you out.

305
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,939
- Isn't that a woman?
- Jeez, I'm not really sure.

306
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:21,582
But you're too drunk to notice,
remember? Take care.

307
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:33,388
- Hey, you. Aloha.
- Aloha.

308
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,598
Not aloha, "hello," aloha, "goodbye. "
We're closed today. Go away.

309
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:40,134
- What are you talking about?
- Order up!

310
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:43,239
- Don't move. I have to talk to you.
- Okay.

311
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:46,072
- Hey! Tattoo-Face!
- Hey, Peanut Butter Cups!

312
00:21:57,924 --> 00:21:59,221
Hi.

313
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:01,154
Hi.

314
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:04,727
My fingers are extra fishy today,
if you care to take a whiff.

315
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:07,194
What was that?

316
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:11,029
I was petting my walrus all morning
and thinking of you the whole time.

317
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:15,237
Okay, pervert.
I think that you should leave.

318
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:18,639
What? I was joking because
of what we talked about yesterday.

319
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:20,913
Yesterday?

320
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:23,915
I've never even met you.

321
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,545
- Nick! I need help!
- Coming, Lucy.

322
00:22:27,954 --> 00:22:29,819
Nick, put that down.
I'll handle it.

323
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:33,255
- You, follow me.
- Wait a... What's going on?

324
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,655
I was kidding around with you!

325
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:39,931
What's happening here?
Is she crazy or something?

326
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:44,835
Lucy is a very special person.
Very different from other people.

327
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:46,938
Okay.

328
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:50,966
About a year ago, Lucy was
in a terrible car accident.

329
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:55,005
She and her father went up
North Shore to get a pineapple.

330
00:23:32,018 --> 00:23:36,682
Her father broke some ribs, but Lucy
suffered a serious head injury.

331
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:39,117
She lost her short-term memory.

332
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,721
So she can't remember anything?

333
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:44,690
No, no, no, she has all of her
long-term memory.

334
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,362
That's a different part
of the brain.

335
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:50,697
Her whole life, up to the night before
the accident, she remembers.

336
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:53,801
She just can't retain
any new information.

337
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,704
It's like her slate gets wiped clean
every night while she sleeps.

338
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:02,344
Hold on. This sounds like something
I would tell a psycho girl...

339
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:04,642
...so she'd stop calling me.
Am I the psycho girl?

340
00:24:05,051 --> 00:24:06,951
I wish I was making this up!

341
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:09,817
She has no memory
that she ever met you.

342
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:12,023
What about the
pineapple-picking thing?

343
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:14,458
She says that every day,
because each morning...

344
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:18,360
...she wakes up thinking it's
October 13th of last year.

345
00:24:18,565 --> 00:24:21,864
She comes for breakfast because
that's what she did on Sundays...

346
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:23,798
...and October 13th
was a Sunday.

347
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,699
She has no idea
it's more than a year later.

348
00:24:28,074 --> 00:24:29,541
She reads the newspaper.

349
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:32,511
It's a special paper her father
puts on their porch.

350
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,980
It's from the day of her accident.
He got hundreds of them printed.

351
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:41,179
Lucy does the same thing every day.

352
00:24:51,147 --> 00:24:53,012
- Hello!
- Back here.

353
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:56,482
- Hi, Dad!
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

354
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:58,780
You got one without me.

355
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:03,114
The lady at the farmers' market
gave it to me as a birthday present.

356
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:05,787
I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.

357
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:09,461
I think she likes you.

358
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:13,124
- Yeah, what's not to like?
- What about our tradition?

359
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,697
Well, I have another idea.
I painted my workshop yesterday.

360
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:19,971
White.

361
00:25:20,677 --> 00:25:23,043
Now it's too white.
Gives me a headache.

362
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:25,739
Oh, yeah, you definitely
need some color in here.

363
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,674
Well, you know,
that's what I was thinking.

364
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:31,119
- Really?
- Yeah. Go nuts.

365
00:25:31,187 --> 00:25:34,588
- Paint me something for my birthday.
- I will.

366
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:38,558
And promise that we can pick
a pineapple for Thanksgiving, okay?

367
00:25:38,695 --> 00:25:41,789
- Sounds great.
- Okay, good.

368
00:25:42,198 --> 00:25:45,531
Hey, you should watch the Vikings
game while I'm painting.

369
00:25:46,202 --> 00:25:48,033
Good idea.

370
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:56,167
- Yeah, baby. Isolate.
- What are we eating tonight, Doug?

371
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:59,204
- Spaghetti, Pop.
- Try not to sweat in the sauce.

372
00:25:59,716 --> 00:26:01,149
Sorry, Pop.

373
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:09,714
Go Vikings.

374
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:14,026
Seven hundred and five.
Seven hundred and six.

375
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,528
- Seven hundred and seven.
- Hey, you guys.

376
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:18,826
Hey, sweetie.
How's the painting coming?

377
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,600
- You'll see.
- Cool.

378
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:23,934
- Oh. What's the score?
- The Vikings are on the two-yard line.

379
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,176
- If they score, they bring it to 14-10.
- Maybe they'll win for your birthday.

380
00:26:29,245 --> 00:26:31,577
And I'll bet Culpepper runs it in.

381
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:36,014
I'll bet he fakes a handoff to Williams,
throws to Kleinsasser in the end zone.

382
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:38,982
- Loser does the dishes?
- You're on.

383
00:26:39,017 --> 00:26:40,689
...keep the offense on the field.

384
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:43,725
Culpepper fakes a handoff
to Williams. He will throw.

385
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,729
He's got Kleinsasser in the end zone!
Touchdown, Minnesota.

386
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:48,662
Doug, you're good.

387
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:51,529
Maybe you should be a coach.

388
00:26:55,772 --> 00:26:58,002
- Dad.
- Moron!

389
00:26:58,274 --> 00:26:59,935
That hurt.

390
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:14,950
And you don't look a day over 25.

391
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:18,556
Yeah, right, and Doug's muscles
aren't pharmaceutically enhanced.

392
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:19,955
What? I use an herb supplement...

393
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:23,629
...that can be purchased at any
health-food store. Check this out.

394
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,598
Check out these glutes.
Rock-hard, baby.

395
00:27:26,803 --> 00:27:28,031
Pretty sweet, huh?

396
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:31,068
Stop it! You're gonna make me
throw up on the cake.

397
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:32,774
Okay, just open your present.

398
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:35,676
Okay. Let's see what we've got here.

399
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:38,542
The Sixth Sense.

400
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:42,842
Hey! When I'm done doing the dishes,
do you guys wanna watch it?

401
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,718
- Sure.
- Sure.

402
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:48,017
Ben Friedkin?

403
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:51,657
Some people, they call me freak.

404
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:57,732
- Ronald Sumner?
- I am. I am a freak. Look at me.

405
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:00,200
Just give me a chance...

406
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:08,402
I can't believe it.
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

407
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,539
I'm shocked.
Did you see that coming?

408
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:11,813
- No.
- Not a clue.

409
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:15,011
- Shocked as hell.
- Anyway, it was awesome.

410
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:17,285
- Happy birthday.
- Love you, Sis.

411
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:21,153
Your muscles are getting so big, I can
barely wrap my arms around you.

412
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:23,120
You like that?
Check this out.

413
00:28:27,864 --> 00:28:32,198
Okay, okay! Enough with the titty
dance! Let your sister go to sleep.

414
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:34,233
- I like it.
- Sweet dreams, Lucy.

415
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,429
- Good night.
- Good night.

416
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:28,151
Hey, Tracy, how you doing?

417
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:29,390
Yeah?

418
00:29:29,425 --> 00:29:32,417
Well, things changed a little bit
since high school.

419
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:04,791
And this is what happens
every single day.

420
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:07,486
How long it gonna take for
her memory to come back?

421
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:10,296
Her doctors say it may
never come back.

422
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:13,594
So, basically,
what you're saying is...

423
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,768
- ... she's perfect for you.
- What do you mean?

424
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:19,669
You can hang out all day with
no attachment, because...

425
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:22,911
Her plane leaves every night?
There's a problem with that.

426
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:24,640
- What is?
- It's evil.

427
00:30:24,675 --> 00:30:25,708
No, it isn't.

428
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:29,349
You meet her, hang out, flirt,
no commitment, nobody gets hurt.

429
00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:33,444
- She's got brain damage, you psycho.
- Okay, I'll give you that one.

430
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,821
But I think it'd be healthy for you.

431
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:38,984
You haven't allowed yourself
to connect with a girl.

432
00:30:38,995 --> 00:30:41,486
I appreciate your interest,
but leave me alone.

433
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:43,988
Hey, you'd be doing exactly
what her father does:

434
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,331
Giving her a wonderful day.

435
00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:50,598
When it's time for you to go on your
big boat trip, poof, you just leave.

436
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:52,770
She'll never even know you're gone.

437
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:56,376
I'm not sure about the "poofing" part,
because I'm not a good poofer.

438
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,979
Demonstrate a good poof for me?

439
00:30:58,014 --> 00:31:00,676
Quit busting my coconuts
for five seconds.

440
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:04,418
All right. Would you stop poofing
on that joint and do some work?

441
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:08,821
Okay. Let's get this sucker ready.

442
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:11,926
Then we're gonna take her
out for a spin.

443
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,498
Captain's log: November 7th.
Nearly midnight.

444
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:20,229
The Sea Serpent is fully
recovered from her mishap...

445
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:23,596
...and ready to once again
brave the open ocean.

446
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:28,806
I think my stitches
opened up again, cuz.

447
00:31:29,045 --> 00:31:32,276
You got a cat?
Because I feel something licking me.

448
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,026
How is it?

449
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:47,756
Peanut Butter Cups.
What are you doing here?

450
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,929
I just wanted to say hi to Lucy.

451
00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:54,366
I promise you I'm not gonna
do anything wrong.

452
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,798
What did Sue say?

453
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:59,599
She said that if I talk to Lucy,
you'll kill me with a meat cleaver.

454
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:02,567
She's the boss, cuz.
But don't worry.

455
00:32:02,578 --> 00:32:05,012
Lucy probably didn't wanna
talk to you anyway.

456
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,050
- What does that mean?
- This ain't a disco.

457
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:12,020
She doesn't want guys hitting on her
during her breakfast.

458
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:14,055
She does if it's Henry Roth.

459
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,785
- Who that?
- Who that? Me that.

460
00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:20,051
I bet you 20 bucks I can get her
to have breakfast with me again.

461
00:32:22,598 --> 00:32:25,066
- You're on.
- I love it.

462
00:32:26,102 --> 00:32:30,004
- How you doing, honey?
- Hey, Sue. Nice haircut.

463
00:32:30,106 --> 00:32:33,007
Oh, mahalo.
See you in a bit.

464
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:37,170
Nick and I have an arrangement.
You can trust me.

465
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,513
Don't worry.

466
00:33:01,637 --> 00:33:04,071
You should try this out.
Put it in there.

467
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,301
Swivelly door.

468
00:33:06,642 --> 00:33:09,042
Waffleonians can
come in and out now.

469
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:13,343
Are you from a country where it's
okay to stick your fingers...

470
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:14,741
...all over someone else's food?

471
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:18,382
No, I'm from this country.

472
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:21,054
Why? Were you gonna eat that? Oh.

473
00:33:21,157 --> 00:33:23,421
All right, well, have a good meal.

474
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:30,859
- Yeah.
- That was pathetic.

475
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,226
Yeah? Why don't you choke
on your Spam?

476
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:35,603
Double or nothing tomorrow.

477
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:45,477
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you...

478
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:48,548
...but you look like a person
who appreciates fine art...

479
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,413
...so I wanted your opinion.

480
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:57,148
I drew this. It's a picture of a father
and son fishing off a fishing boat.

481
00:33:57,193 --> 00:33:58,854
There's a walrus right there...

482
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,226
Oh, you don't speak English. Okay.

483
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:12,731
Doesn't look Chinese.

484
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:14,835
Forty.

485
00:34:16,712 --> 00:34:18,077
Can I have that?

486
00:34:18,214 --> 00:34:21,047
I need something
to wipe my ass with.

487
00:34:21,217 --> 00:34:22,548
Shut up.

488
00:34:47,743 --> 00:34:49,677
I wonder what's the matter with him.

489
00:34:50,246 --> 00:34:52,771
Looks like a stupid asshole to me.

490
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:02,349
Excuse me. Okay.
I didn't mean to startle you.

491
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:04,283
- No, that's all right. I...
- Are you okay?

492
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,558
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm having
a problem with something...

493
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:09,628
Something that I could help you with?

494
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:11,562
No, no, no. I just...

495
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:14,702
...can't read.

496
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:17,738
You gotta be kidding me.

497
00:35:17,773 --> 00:35:19,798
- I can read that for you.
- No. Thank you.

498
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:22,039
I can do this on my own.

499
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:24,245
Appreciate the sentiment.

500
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,874
I'm gonna get an order of the...

501
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:38,919
Pan...

502
00:35:39,295 --> 00:35:40,956
Pan...

503
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:44,612
Panku...

504
00:35:44,647 --> 00:35:45,926
Ca...

505
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:47,860
Panclocks.

506
00:35:48,304 --> 00:35:50,966
- Pancakes.
- Okay, I'll have pancake.

507
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:53,673
- Pancakes.
- Pancah... Pancakes! Pancakes!

508
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,408
- I'm so stupid!
- Oh, don't cry.

509
00:35:56,443 --> 00:35:59,008
- Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
- Don't cry.

510
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:02,079
- I don't know anything!
- What a loser.

511
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:08,119
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you sit with me?

512
00:36:08,324 --> 00:36:11,851
You can have some breakfast and
I'll help teach you some of the words.

513
00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:14,125
- Okay.
- All right.

514
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,230
- That sounds nice.
- Come on over.

515
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:18,357
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

516
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,673
So I comes before the E?

517
00:36:27,843 --> 00:36:30,141
- Except after C?
- Yes.

518
00:36:30,346 --> 00:36:33,144
Okay, and C is that little
half a squiggly one, right?

519
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:35,476
- Yes.
- I think I'm getting it.

520
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:39,343
- How'd you get so good at teaching?
- I'm a teacher. I do it all the time.

521
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:42,153
I'm an art teacher at
the Haluki-liki Junior High.

522
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,419
Well, you Haluki-liki the kind of
teacher all the kids have crushes on.

523
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:49,353
I know I would if I was in your class.

524
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:54,699
Okay.

525
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,498
Oh, boy, do my...
My fingers smell like fish.

526
00:36:57,873 --> 00:36:59,704
That doesn't gross you out, does it?

527
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,638
No, not at all.

528
00:37:01,877 --> 00:37:03,708
Really?

529
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:09,408
If Lucy gets hurt, I'm gonna chop you
with the meat cleaver.

530
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:10,977
Okay, okay.

531
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:14,515
So I had a nice time.

532
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,006
- Yeah, me too.
- Thank you very much.

533
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,122
- Let me get it for you.
- Thank you.

534
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:20,953
Sure.

535
00:37:21,397 --> 00:37:23,194
Okay.

536
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:34,899
I just want to eat you up, tomorrow
and the next day, next day, next day...

537
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:38,346
I'll see you around.

538
00:37:38,414 --> 00:37:40,109
Okay.

539
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,352
Really? That's it?

540
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:49,152
- That's what?
- All that flirting...

541
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:52,883
...and phony "I can't read" stuff,
and you're not gonna ask me out...

542
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:54,259
...or for my phone number?

543
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,728
- I can't read.
- Oh, shut up.

544
00:37:56,932 --> 00:38:00,265
That was one of the goofiest things
I've ever seen, but I thought:

545
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:03,269
"Hey, if this guy is so desperate
to meet me...

546
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:05,805
...he might be worth talking to. "

547
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:07,738
But then I get stiffed.

548
00:38:07,943 --> 00:38:10,104
No, no, no,
this is what happened. I...

549
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:13,278
Mahalo for the ego boost.

550
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:16,543
- You're right. You're right. I feel like...
- No worries.

551
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:18,977
I gotta...
I can read a little!

552
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:22,913
I didn't know I came before E!
That one I didn't know, I swear.

553
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,789
Oh, you idiot.

554
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,121
I hope you're happy, Shamu.

555
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:32,991
Marlin. It's Sue.

556
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:49,645
- Oh, aloha, sir. My name's Henry...
- I know who you are.

557
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:54,456
- I want to apologize to your daughter.
- Not gonna happen.

558
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,981
She's inside.
We're gonna straighten things out.

559
00:38:56,992 --> 00:39:00,291
Dad, the damn mongoose
got in the garbage again!

560
00:39:02,498 --> 00:39:04,489
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

561
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,264
Mr. Roth, I have one simple request:

562
00:39:07,503 --> 00:39:09,130
Stay away from my daughter.

563
00:39:09,505 --> 00:39:13,066
Absolutely. I hurt her feelings
and don't want it to end like that.

564
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,305
It's gonna end like this.

565
00:39:15,511 --> 00:39:17,001
Calm down, little fellow.

566
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:20,744
I'm gonna kill you! You're a dead man.
Okay, I'm calm.

567
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:22,608
I'm calm.

568
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:25,350
- Let me help you up.
- I got it! I got it.

569
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:30,015
It's just Dad and I work too hard
to protect Lucy to let some idiot ruin it.

570
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:32,493
I know what you guys do
and I totally respect that.

571
00:39:32,528 --> 00:39:36,259
If you know her condition, you know
she can't have a normal relationship.

572
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:38,659
The next morning,
she won't know who he is.

573
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:41,127
And any guy who's okay with that...

574
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:42,526
...ain't okay with me.

575
00:39:43,038 --> 00:39:46,997
- I'm not looking for a one-night stand.
- Anything with Lucy is, numb-nuts.

576
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:50,705
Give us a break.
Just stay away from the Hukilau Cafe.

577
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:53,515
My daughter's been through enough.

578
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,711
Okay. I'm sorry.

579
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:04,754
I could have whooped his ass,
but this gravel, I slipped on it...

580
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,961
Yeah, well, maybe you need to do
a few more butt flexes.

581
00:40:08,564 --> 00:40:10,031
Cheap shot, Dad.

582
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:12,533
So fresh and so clean.

583
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:15,662
Hey, Alexa, did you hook up
with that girl from the bar?

584
00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:18,038
- I chickened out.
- Really?

585
00:40:18,073 --> 00:40:21,065
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess I prefer sausage to taco.

586
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:25,262
- What?
- Yeah. No, I agree, buddy.

587
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,947
Get out of here.
Run for the hills.

588
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:30,881
Let me ask you something, Alexa.

589
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:34,078
If you promised a girl's dad
that you wouldn't see her...

590
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:36,387
...would you consider that
a binding promise?

591
00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:38,058
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

592
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:40,789
Then again, there are always ways
around such things.

593
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:42,859
- Like?
- For example...

594
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:47,364
...if I promised a woman's father
I would not see her...

595
00:40:47,603 --> 00:40:51,471
...I would simply shut my eyes
while she serviced my manhood.

596
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:55,702
That's actually a cool way to look at it.

597
00:40:55,737 --> 00:40:57,408
And a very gross way.

598
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:16,564
He asked me not to go to the Hukilau.
I'm not going there.

599
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:18,690
I'm not doing anything wrong.

600
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:27,836
Sorry to bother you.
I'm kind of stuck here.

601
00:41:29,144 --> 00:41:32,113
- Car trouble?
- Yeah. You mind giving me a jump?

602
00:41:32,648 --> 00:41:34,081
Okay.

603
00:41:34,149 --> 00:41:35,810
Appreciate your time.

604
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:37,846
Not everybody would have stopped.

605
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:40,178
- You're real sweet.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

606
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:48,652
I can't believe you fell for that.

607
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:52,759
Well, my grandfather died
trying to jump-start a car.

608
00:41:57,172 --> 00:42:00,164
I'm sorry.
I was just joking around.

609
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:03,576
I can't believe you fell for that!

610
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,374
Oh, my God.

611
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:07,147
That was very good.

612
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:09,343
- My name's Henry.
- I'm Lucy.

613
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:11,812
Nice to meet you.
You look like a nice...

614
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:21,026
Hi. Sorry for the delay.
Should be a few minutes.

615
00:42:21,196 --> 00:42:23,664
- No problem. No worries.
- Where you coming from?

616
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,826
Breakfast?

617
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:27,634
- Yeah.
- How was it?

618
00:42:27,703 --> 00:42:29,500
I had waffles. They were delicious.

619
00:42:29,705 --> 00:42:32,071
I like making little houses
out of waffles.

620
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:36,542
- You do?
- That's my thing.

621
00:42:38,714 --> 00:42:40,079
- What's your name?
- Lucy.

622
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:41,546
Hi, I'm Henry.

623
00:42:41,717 --> 00:42:44,709
Okay, pal. When she stops,
just let her pet you. Look cute.

624
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,383
Go to the middle of the road.
Thank you. Right there. Perfect.

625
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,597
- Oh, shit.
- Here she comes. Smile.

626
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:02,260
Where is she?

627
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:07,606
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

628
00:43:09,745 --> 00:43:11,610
Okay. That didn't work.

629
00:43:11,747 --> 00:43:14,614
Shit your pants? So did I.

630
00:43:20,255 --> 00:43:22,223
Okay, this is her.
Start beating me up.

631
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:23,918
Make it look good.

632
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:28,889
Give me your wallet!

633
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:32,358
Okay, haole, what do you think?
You can come to this island...

634
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:35,669
- ... eat our pineapple...
- Help me! Not so hard.

635
00:43:35,771 --> 00:43:37,904
- Take it easy.
- Try to bang our women.

636
00:43:37,939 --> 00:43:40,037
Making my sister
clean your hotel room.

637
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:42,573
Okay. What's that have to do
with this? Relax.

638
00:43:42,778 --> 00:43:45,269
- Hey! Hey! Help me, please!
- Stupid haole!

639
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:49,478
Yeah, that's right. Take that!
And that! And that!

640
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:51,252
And that! And that!

641
00:43:51,286 --> 00:43:53,550
You got him. You got him.
Enough. Enough.

642
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:55,086
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes...

643
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,780
Okay, I'll be back.
Come here!

644
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:58,919
No, no! I think he's had enough.

645
00:43:59,795 --> 00:44:01,353
I'm sorry.

646
00:44:02,297 --> 00:44:04,527
My eye!

647
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:08,031
- You got him!
- Not good enough!

648
00:44:08,303 --> 00:44:09,269
Oh, Kamehameha!

649
00:44:09,304 --> 00:44:11,363
He learned his lesson!

650
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:13,866
- What's your name?
- My name's Henry.

651
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:16,140
- You did good.
- Hi. Sorry.

652
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:18,040
I'm in a community-watch program...

653
00:44:18,313 --> 00:44:20,195
Oh, you crazy bitch!

654
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,078
Yeah, keep running!

655
00:44:22,317 --> 00:44:24,717
Okay, okay, he's... He's gone now.

656
00:44:31,326 --> 00:44:33,157
Not her. False alarm.

657
00:44:37,332 --> 00:44:40,426
Don't worry, I called the cops already.
I'm all set.

658
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:42,929
Yeah? You all set for this, Mr. Smarty?

659
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:47,775
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

660
00:44:47,843 --> 00:44:51,370
When you're finished playing your
kidnap-victim crap on my daughter...

661
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:52,574
...come by the house.

662
00:44:52,848 --> 00:44:54,941
Okay.

663
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:04,382
Oh, boy.

664
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:13,630
There's something I wanna show you.

665
00:45:23,879 --> 00:45:26,973
We figured it out. She only sings
on days she meets you.

666
00:45:27,382 --> 00:45:29,350
You're kidding me. That song?

667
00:45:29,384 --> 00:45:30,817
That's Mom and Dad's song.

668
00:45:30,886 --> 00:45:33,912
When her mom was alive,
Lucy would have me take that tape...

669
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:36,806
- ... on every fishing trip I went on.
- Oh, yeah?

670
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:39,224
Yeah, she knew it would make me
miss her mom...

671
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:41,157
...and want to come home sooner.

672
00:45:41,396 --> 00:45:45,560
I'm seeing a new side to you, sir.
I gotta tell you, it's grossing me out.

673
00:45:47,402 --> 00:45:48,733
Let me ask you something.

674
00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:52,135
What's in it for you?
What do you get out of this?

675
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:55,240
I don't know.

676
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:02,940
Wouldn't you want to spend
an hour a day with that?

677
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:05,751
Actually, no. She sings like shit.

678
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:08,889
- What?
- Can I ask you guys something?

679
00:46:08,924 --> 00:46:11,757
What'll happen down the line?
Someday she'll wake up...

680
00:46:11,927 --> 00:46:15,124
...look in the mirror and notice
she aged 10 years overnight.

681
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,397
You know something, Henry?

682
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:20,230
I worry about that
every damn day of my life.

683
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,930
Pardon me.

684
00:46:26,942 --> 00:46:30,036
Sorry to interrupt, but I noticed we
were both eating alone...

685
00:46:30,445 --> 00:46:33,903
...and I thought I could sit with you,
maybe build a syrup Jacuzzi...

686
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:37,180
- ... for your waffle house?
- Oh, that would be nice...

687
00:46:37,452 --> 00:46:39,750
...but I have a boyfriend.

688
00:46:39,955 --> 00:46:41,980
So I'm sorry.

689
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:46,325
You're making up a boyfriend
to get rid of me?

690
00:46:46,461 --> 00:46:47,860
No, I'm not.

691
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:50,056
What's his name, then?

692
00:46:50,091 --> 00:46:51,227
Ringo.

693
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:53,525
Is his last name Starr?

694
00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:56,961
- No. McCartney.
- McCartney, okay.

695
00:46:57,472 --> 00:46:59,303
- Oh, no.
- All right. I'm sorry.

696
00:46:59,474 --> 00:47:01,874
No! This cop is writing me a ticket!

697
00:47:02,477 --> 00:47:04,468
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I wouldn't go out there.

698
00:47:04,479 --> 00:47:05,878
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Go on!

699
00:47:05,981 --> 00:47:07,346
I'm coming.

700
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:09,473
The tags don't expire
for seven months.

701
00:47:09,484 --> 00:47:12,282
- They expired May of this year.
- No! No, no!

702
00:47:12,487 --> 00:47:13,954
They expire May of next year.

703
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:16,480
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

704
00:47:16,491 --> 00:47:18,220
- I don't.
- This is ridiculous.

705
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:20,723
I'm not paying for this!
It's October!

706
00:47:20,996 --> 00:47:23,464
Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
Look, October!

707
00:47:23,498 --> 00:47:25,363
Lucy, let's go back inside.

708
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:28,230
What?

709
00:47:38,013 --> 00:47:39,503
What?

710
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:48,148
Having a bad day, Doug!

711
00:48:29,564 --> 00:48:31,327
Sweetheart...

712
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:33,830
...these are from the accident.

713
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:53,816
Oh, no!

714
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:03,496
I can feel it.

715
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,127
You were in the hospital
for three months, sweetheart.

716
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:26,315
I have to talk to this doctor.
I need to hear it from him.

717
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:28,612
You have heard it, sweetie.
Many times.

718
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,024
I have?

719
00:49:33,628 --> 00:49:35,186
I'll take her.

720
00:49:36,631 --> 00:49:39,293
I have to hear for myself too.

721
00:49:50,145 --> 00:49:52,340
Doug, just take this, okay?
I can't...

722
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:54,809
I can't look at it anymore.

723
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,279
- It's gonna be all right, Luce.
- Don't call me Luce. I barely know you.

724
00:49:59,654 --> 00:50:01,884
Sweetie, you're sort of dating him.

725
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:05,524
Sorry I'm not better-looking.

726
00:50:07,662 --> 00:50:10,290
What else happened
since last October?

727
00:50:10,665 --> 00:50:14,465
- What about my students?
- Miss Campbell took over your class.

728
00:50:17,172 --> 00:50:20,107
- Did Alicia marry that guy?
- Yeah.

729
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:22,541
Doug, did you win
the Mr. Hawaii contest?

730
00:50:22,677 --> 00:50:24,975
I didn't know there was gonna be
a urine test.

731
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,908
Wow.

732
00:50:28,183 --> 00:50:29,548
Do we have sex?

733
00:50:31,186 --> 00:50:35,054
No, we don't.
Just so everybody knows that.

734
00:50:36,191 --> 00:50:37,419
We want to.

735
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:40,388
Just kidding.

736
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:47,896
So you guys have to just lie
to me every day.

737
00:51:01,716 --> 00:51:03,843
Hey, Lucy.
Good to see you again.

738
00:51:06,721 --> 00:51:08,814
What the hell's her problem?

739
00:51:09,224 --> 00:51:11,749
She doesn't remember
who you are, brah.

740
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:13,591
Oh, yeah.

741
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:16,492
I suck at this job.

742
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:20,167
Lucy, these are your
brain scans here.

743
00:51:20,235 --> 00:51:22,481
I'm afraid they show
no improvement.

744
00:51:22,516 --> 00:51:24,728
The temporal lobe
was severely damaged.

745
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,208
What we believe is scar tissue
here is impairing your ability...

746
00:51:28,243 --> 00:51:31,906
...to convert short-term memory into
long-term memory while you sleep.

747
00:51:32,247 --> 00:51:35,011
The condition's come to be known
as Goldfield Syndrome.

748
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,447
- Who's Goldfield?
- A brilliant Lithuanian psychiatrist.

749
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:40,720
He himself suffered
temporal-lobe damage.

750
00:51:40,755 --> 00:51:42,848
Took him four years
to publish his findings...

751
00:51:43,258 --> 00:51:45,920
...because he had to keep
starting over from scratch.

752
00:51:46,261 --> 00:51:49,628
Obviously, your sense of humor
is still intact, and that's here.

753
00:51:49,764 --> 00:51:51,527
Magnificent amygdala as well.

754
00:51:51,766 --> 00:51:54,667
- Doctor, I have a question.
- I'd be happy to answer it...

755
00:51:54,769 --> 00:51:59,172
...but as I've told you before, this is a
hygienic facility. Shirts are required.

756
00:51:59,274 --> 00:52:00,707
- Oh, okay.
- Nice move.

757
00:52:02,777 --> 00:52:04,472
Listen, doctor, this...

758
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:08,408
...friend of mine's been experimenting
a little with steroids.

759
00:52:08,443 --> 00:52:10,148
He's been having a lot
of wet dreams.

760
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:12,810
Could there be a connection
between them?

761
00:52:12,845 --> 00:52:14,618
Douglas, get off the juice.

762
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:17,815
As for the nocturnal emissions,
why don't you take a swim...

763
00:52:18,293 --> 00:52:22,161
...buy a shirt with no holes,
find a wahine and take her to dinner.

764
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:24,492
I'll tell my friend you said so.

765
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,030
In any case, Lucy,
your condition is stable...

766
00:52:28,303 --> 00:52:29,895
...but most likely permanent.

767
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:32,239
I'm so sorry, dear.

768
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:34,002
But it could be worse.

769
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,175
Yeah? How?

770
00:52:37,312 --> 00:52:40,145
I think you should meet
Ten Second Tom.

771
00:52:40,231 --> 00:52:43,962
Callahan Institute is the leading
brain-injury clinic in the Pacific Rim.

772
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,584
We are funded out of Sandusky, Ohio
by T.B. Callahan...

773
00:52:47,822 --> 00:52:51,087
...the automotive-components tycoon
and philanthropist.

774
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,355
And now, I would like
to introduce to you...

775
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:01,666
...our most distinguished
clinical subject...

776
00:53:01,836 --> 00:53:03,235
...Tom.

777
00:53:03,338 --> 00:53:04,930
- Hi. I'm Tom.
- Henry.

778
00:53:04,965 --> 00:53:06,067
- Marlin.
- Doug.

779
00:53:06,341 --> 00:53:07,569
- Lucy.
- Hi.

780
00:53:07,842 --> 00:53:10,003
Cool flip-flops.
Where'd you get them?

781
00:53:10,345 --> 00:53:13,371
You like those? It's interesting.
I was on the North Shore...

782
00:53:13,406 --> 00:53:14,576
Hi, I'm Tom.

783
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,318
- Henry.
- Hi.

784
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:19,343
- Marlin.
- Tom lost part of his brain...

785
00:53:19,854 --> 00:53:22,550
...in a hunting accident.
His memory lasts 10 seconds.

786
00:53:22,857 --> 00:53:24,324
I was in an accident? That's terrible.

787
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:26,486
Don't worry.
You'll get over it in seconds.

788
00:53:26,861 --> 00:53:30,319
Get over it? I mean, what happened?
Did I get shot in the brain...?

789
00:53:30,365 --> 00:53:32,595
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

790
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:34,129
- Hi.
- Doug.

791
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:35,597
- Hey.
- Marlin.

792
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:38,395
Hey, Tom, can I tell you a secret?

793
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:43,935
Don't you think you're a little old
to still have wet dreams?

794
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:50,215
- They liked that.
- Hi, I'm Tom.

795
00:53:50,385 --> 00:53:52,717
- Yeah, watch yourself, Tom.
- Easy.

796
00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:09,301
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- All right. Good night.

797
00:54:09,404 --> 00:54:11,998
Good night, you guys.
I'll see you tomorrow.

798
00:54:13,908 --> 00:54:16,502
- And I guess I'll see you too?
- Oh, yeah.

799
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:18,970
You had a rough day today.
I'm sorry.

800
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,108
I hope you get some rest tonight.

801
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:23,383
Okay.

802
00:54:23,418 --> 00:54:24,885
Good night.

803
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,682
So how you getting home?

804
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:29,014
- You gonna take the Likelike or...
- Hey.

805
00:54:31,426 --> 00:54:34,156
Thank you for being
so nice to me today.

806
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:36,989
- Sure.
- I don't want you to...

807
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,626
...strike out tomorrow.

808
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:40,798
So maybe you could talk
to me about...

809
00:54:41,436 --> 00:54:42,698
...lilies.

810
00:54:42,937 --> 00:54:44,165
Lilies?

811
00:54:44,439 --> 00:54:46,168
I'm a sucker for lilies.

812
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:48,068
Thanks for the tip.

813
00:54:48,443 --> 00:54:51,275
Good night.

814
00:54:51,946 --> 00:54:53,913
My, oh, my.

815
00:54:53,948 --> 00:54:55,939
- Lover-boy.
- Yes, sir.

816
00:54:56,451 --> 00:54:58,646
You don't have to rush off.
Stick around.

817
00:54:58,953 --> 00:55:01,421
You've earned yourself
a couple beers.

818
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:05,084
So what'll you do when
you finish the boat?

819
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,824
Actually, I'm going on a trip soon...

820
00:55:06,961 --> 00:55:09,361
...to study undersea
Pacific walrus behaviors.

821
00:55:09,464 --> 00:55:10,795
Sounds kind of fruity.

822
00:55:10,965 --> 00:55:13,195
- Thank you.
- How long is it gonna take?

823
00:55:13,468 --> 00:55:14,696
About a year.

824
00:55:14,969 --> 00:55:16,800
Guess you won't miss days like this.

825
00:55:17,472 --> 00:55:20,168
Well, maybe days like this
don't have to be so bad.

826
00:55:20,475 --> 00:55:22,306
What are you trying to say?

827
00:55:23,478 --> 00:55:24,843
When you guys tell her...

828
00:55:24,979 --> 00:55:27,897
...she's not just finding out
about the accident.

829
00:55:27,932 --> 00:55:30,815
She's finding out that her life
is basically a setup.

830
00:55:30,985 --> 00:55:32,953
I think that freaks her out the most.

831
00:55:32,987 --> 00:55:34,386
- You're an expert now?
- No.

832
00:55:34,989 --> 00:55:37,423
I'm saying I wish there was
another way besides:

833
00:55:37,492 --> 00:55:41,189
"Sorry we couldn't trick you today.
Here's pictures of your broken head. "

834
00:55:41,496 --> 00:55:43,862
- You want a broken head?
- You'll give him one?

835
00:55:43,998 --> 00:55:46,159
No, Daddy, I thought
you was gonna do it.

836
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:49,265
Nobody's gotta break my head.
I'm gonna split anyways.

837
00:55:49,504 --> 00:55:51,971
Oh, don't go just because
my son is psychotic.

838
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:55,305
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Keep them dry there, Doug.

839
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,807
Very funny.

840
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:21,695
- Excuse me. Lucy Whitmore?
- Yes?

841
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:23,936
I have a delivery for you.

842
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:26,700
- A delivery for me?
- Yes.

843
00:56:28,543 --> 00:56:31,341
Oh, they're beautiful.

844
00:56:32,046 --> 00:56:34,446
- Who are they from?
- That I can't tell you.

845
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:38,178
It's a secret admirer.
He also wants you to have this.

846
00:56:38,553 --> 00:56:41,886
- Who's your friend, Lucy?
- Oh, well, I mean, I don't know.

847
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:44,354
We just met, but look.

848
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,390
I have a secret admirer.

849
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:49,189
Oh, really? What's this?

850
00:56:49,564 --> 00:56:51,054
It's a videotape.

851
00:56:51,566 --> 00:56:53,033
A videotape of what?

852
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:55,228
I have no idea.

853
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,367
But I have to find out.

854
00:56:58,573 --> 00:57:00,063
Happy birthday, Daddy.

855
00:57:00,074 --> 00:57:03,100
- Thank you, sweetie.
- That's right. Happy birthday, sir.

856
00:57:03,135 --> 00:57:05,011
- What are you, 200 today?
- That's cute.

857
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,606
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to try something different.

858
00:57:08,641 --> 00:57:11,017
If it doesn't work,
we've only wasted one day.

859
00:57:30,605 --> 00:57:32,368
Martha Stewart faced charges...

860
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:36,508
Oh, God!

861
00:58:17,151 --> 00:58:18,846
Okay, I think it's on. Go. Go.

862
00:58:19,153 --> 00:58:21,314
Aloha! I'm Henry Roth.

863
00:58:21,656 --> 00:58:27,652
We met here at the Hukilau Cafe
about a year after your accident.

864
00:58:27,662 --> 00:58:30,688
I like you and you like me, most days.

865
00:58:31,165 --> 00:58:34,430
Every day is different, but basically
this is what happens, Lucy.

866
00:58:34,669 --> 00:58:36,102
Kikikoloko, take the camera.

867
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,432
- I got it.
- Don't drop it.

868
00:58:37,672 --> 00:58:39,697
Okay, all right.
Here we are, right here.

869
00:58:40,174 --> 00:58:42,506
The part of you in this reenactment...

870
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:44,838
...will be played
by my good friend, Ula.

871
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,240
Aloha. Sorry about your brain.

872
00:58:49,183 --> 00:58:50,582
I had a accident too.

873
00:58:50,685 --> 00:58:53,586
Believe it or not, this my good eye.

874
00:58:54,188 --> 00:58:55,416
- We ready?
- Yeah.

875
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:59,387
Hi. I like that waffle teepee
that you have built.

876
00:58:59,694 --> 00:59:03,596
Oh! So nice of you to notice.
Please, sit down.

877
00:59:03,698 --> 00:59:05,666
I would love to.

878
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:08,362
My name is Henry, by the way.

879
00:59:08,397 --> 00:59:10,102
My name is Lucy.

880
00:59:10,204 --> 00:59:12,229
Smell my fingers?

881
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:15,266
Fish. Right on.

882
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,702
So, Lucy, I work at an aquarium.

883
00:59:19,213 --> 00:59:21,681
Aquariums make me super horny.

884
00:59:21,716 --> 00:59:24,378
That's not funny.
Don't rub those.

885
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:26,710
Sorry, Mr. Whitmore,
if you're watching.

886
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:28,780
It's very late,
and my friend's unstable.

887
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:31,919
Come on, stop with the licking!
You're making me sick.

888
00:59:31,954 --> 00:59:33,250
Lucy, I'm sorry.

889
00:59:33,728 --> 00:59:38,256
Anyways, I know you wish I was
making all this stuff up.

890
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,393
I wish I was too.

891
00:59:41,736 --> 00:59:43,202
But the good news is...

892
00:59:43,237 --> 00:59:45,398
...so many people out there
care about you:

893
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,403
Your dad and Doug and a couple
of your friends here at the Hukilau...

894
00:59:49,438 --> 00:59:50,904
...who have a message for you.

895
00:59:51,245 --> 00:59:55,181
Lucy, as you know,
your mother and I were best friends.

896
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:00,311
That's why I promised her that
I would always help look after you.

897
01:00:02,256 --> 01:00:05,225
Sometimes life isn't very fair...

898
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,784
...but we still have you.

899
01:00:10,264 --> 01:00:14,166
Oh, and if you're wondering about
this guy who's making this tape...

900
01:00:14,769 --> 01:00:17,397
...he's okay.

901
01:00:17,772 --> 01:00:21,435
Hey, Lucy. Just so you know,
since you lost your memory...

902
01:00:21,776 --> 01:00:24,472
...I became governor of Hawaii.

903
01:00:24,779 --> 01:00:27,145
No, just kidding. I'm too smart.

904
01:00:29,283 --> 01:00:33,219
Kualaliku! Get your brother
off the dishwasher!

905
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:37,314
So whenever you're ready,
we'd all love to talk to you...

906
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:39,225
...and answer any questions
you have...

907
01:00:39,293 --> 01:00:42,126
...and you're the best, Lucy. Aloha.

908
01:00:57,311 --> 01:00:59,836
How many times
have I watched this?

909
01:01:00,314 --> 01:01:01,781
This is the first time.

910
01:01:06,821 --> 01:01:09,654
Okay, she cried for about an hour.
That's not too bad.

911
01:01:09,824 --> 01:01:13,419
I bet in another hour she'll be ready
to see her friends, have lunch...

912
01:01:13,828 --> 01:01:15,056
...get her life back.

913
01:01:15,329 --> 01:01:17,263
We could do this every day.

914
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:21,529
We'll leave it up to her.

915
01:01:21,836 --> 01:01:23,360
All right.

916
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:29,036
So how's the cow?

917
01:01:29,343 --> 01:01:32,574
Same as you. Every day they
have to convince her she's a cow.

918
01:01:37,351 --> 01:01:40,047
Wow, look. The bark is healing.

919
01:01:40,082 --> 01:01:41,913
You're gonna get there.

920
01:01:42,356 --> 01:01:45,018
I never hung out with you
in the afternoon like this.

921
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,827
In this lighting, man, oh, man,
you look...

922
01:01:47,862 --> 01:01:49,989
...disgusting.

923
01:01:50,364 --> 01:01:52,025
Yeah.

924
01:01:52,366 --> 01:01:57,201
I don't know how you get me to fall for
that egg-shaped head every morning.

925
01:01:57,371 --> 01:02:00,306
All I have to do is slide on
my designer jeans...

926
01:02:00,374 --> 01:02:03,901
...and just kind of wiggle
in front of you. You go nuts.

927
01:02:05,379 --> 01:02:09,042
Why couldn't I have met you one day
before the accident?

928
01:02:09,383 --> 01:02:13,012
Don't worry, because if you hung out
with me for more than one day...

929
01:02:13,387 --> 01:02:15,354
...you'd realize I'm a bore.

930
01:02:15,389 --> 01:02:17,584
- Oh, well, I have news for you.
- Yes?

931
01:02:17,892 --> 01:02:19,826
It takes less than one day.

932
01:02:19,894 --> 01:02:21,885
You know something?
That hurt.

933
01:02:21,896 --> 01:02:24,797
Your damaged temporal lobe
is causing me pain...

934
01:02:25,399 --> 01:02:27,230
...and I'm gonna get you for that.

935
01:02:28,402 --> 01:02:30,336
Now you're dead!

936
01:02:48,923 --> 01:02:52,086
- I can't believe you're pregnant.
- I know.

937
01:02:52,426 --> 01:02:55,452
- And I got her on the first try.
- Yeah. Easy.

938
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,226
And, Tammy, you are so thin.

939
01:02:57,431 --> 01:02:58,762
Thanks, Luce.

940
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:00,730
And I'm so glad you finally got...

941
01:03:00,935 --> 01:03:04,132
...that gender-reassignment surgery,
Jennifer. I mean, Jonathan.

942
01:03:04,438 --> 01:03:06,099
Mahalo.

943
01:03:06,941 --> 01:03:08,465
- Here you go, Lucy.
- Thank you.

944
01:03:08,943 --> 01:03:10,910
- You're welcome.
- You must be Lucy's friend.

945
01:03:10,945 --> 01:03:14,437
- The one who made the tape.
- I think he's more than my friend.

946
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:16,916
- You're my boyfriend, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

947
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:19,647
So every day you help her
to realize what happened...

948
01:03:19,954 --> 01:03:22,718
...and you wait patiently for her
to be okay with it...

949
01:03:22,957 --> 01:03:25,016
...then get her to fall in love
with you again?

950
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:26,721
Yes, ma'am.

951
01:03:27,962 --> 01:03:29,190
You asshole!

952
01:03:29,463 --> 01:03:32,523
You don't even open the fricking car
door for me anymore.

953
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:34,832
You're in trouble.

954
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:37,597
I gotta go tinkle.

955
01:03:41,976 --> 01:03:45,468
Okay, so tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

956
01:03:45,479 --> 01:03:47,538
Okay. Well, I've...

957
01:03:47,982 --> 01:03:51,179
...won over seven all-you-can-eat
chicken-wing contests.

958
01:03:51,214 --> 01:03:53,112
- Really?
- Yes.

959
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:56,513
And I'm a ballet dancer,
but only in my bathroom.

960
01:03:56,991 --> 01:03:59,425
No, what do you want to know?

961
01:04:00,995 --> 01:04:02,553
Do you love me?

962
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,865
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

963
01:04:08,002 --> 01:04:10,766
I was just asking more for
informational purposes.

964
01:04:11,005 --> 01:04:13,337
It's to keep the video as up-to-date
as possible.

965
01:04:13,507 --> 01:04:15,168
Sure.

966
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:19,946
Well, love is a very loaded word.

967
01:04:22,516 --> 01:04:24,507
Let's see. I...

968
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:30,321
I go to this restaurant every morning,
and I see you there, reading.

969
01:04:31,025 --> 01:04:32,890
And...

970
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:37,554
I love you very much.

971
01:04:38,032 --> 01:04:41,160
Probably more than anybody could
love another person.

972
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,667
And how do I feel about you?

973
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:51,010
You're excited about
the chicken-wing thing.

974
01:04:51,545 --> 01:04:53,342
And...

975
01:04:53,547 --> 01:04:56,744
...you've been dying to make out
with me for some time now.

976
01:05:08,562 --> 01:05:10,052
Feeling better now?

977
01:05:10,064 --> 01:05:12,897
Nothing beats a first kiss.

978
01:05:20,574 --> 01:05:23,702
There's nothing like a first kiss.

979
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,227
Nothing beats a first kiss.

980
01:05:48,602 --> 01:05:50,763
That's what I've heard.

981
01:05:55,609 --> 01:05:57,736
Nothing beats a first...

982
01:06:09,123 --> 01:06:10,385
What are you doing?

983
01:06:10,624 --> 01:06:13,115
Nothing. I was just getting
some lint off for you.

984
01:06:13,127 --> 01:06:15,095
You were going for a feelski!

985
01:06:15,129 --> 01:06:20,032
All right, I'm sorry, but this is like the
23rd time we've made out already...

986
01:06:20,634 --> 01:06:22,124
...and they're getting blue.

987
01:06:22,636 --> 01:06:25,104
I know. I know.

988
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:28,040
I mean, I really don't know.

989
01:06:28,142 --> 01:06:31,077
For me, it still feels like the first time.

990
01:06:31,145 --> 01:06:32,840
Okay, let's average it out then.

991
01:06:33,147 --> 01:06:36,082
It's the 23rd time for me
and the first time for you.

992
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,482
- That's about our 12th time.
- Yeah?

993
01:06:38,652 --> 01:06:41,621
Now, Hawaiian law clearly states
after the 12th date...

994
01:06:42,156 --> 01:06:45,387
...I'm entitled to unlimited
boob access.

995
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,460
Why didn't I meet you one day
before the accident?

996
01:06:51,665 --> 01:06:54,031
You say that all the time.

997
01:06:54,168 --> 01:06:56,136
You want to meet a friend of mine?

998
01:07:00,174 --> 01:07:01,732
All right.

999
01:07:02,676 --> 01:07:06,407
Jocko, this is Lucy.
Lucy, this is Jocko.

1000
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:10,207
Wow! Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1001
01:07:11,185 --> 01:07:13,710
He is awesome! He is so smart.

1002
01:07:14,188 --> 01:07:18,420
Check this out. Jocko, what does
the teapot do when the water's ready?

1003
01:07:21,695 --> 01:07:23,595
- Very good.
- Can I ask him a question?

1004
01:07:23,697 --> 01:07:25,255
Go ahead.

1005
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:27,360
Jocko...

1006
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:31,398
...do you think that Henry and I
are ready to take our relationship...

1007
01:07:31,433 --> 01:07:33,002
...to the next level?

1008
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:36,471
You sure about that?

1009
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:39,941
Do you think I should bring him
into the other room...

1010
01:07:40,214 --> 01:07:42,648
...and take advantage of him?

1011
01:07:48,722 --> 01:07:50,519
I saw that hand gesture.

1012
01:07:50,724 --> 01:07:52,692
- And I'm glad you did it.
- Really?

1013
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:07,207
- Use that.
- Oh, wow. Look!

1014
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:08,469
- Yeah.
- They're...

1015
01:08:08,742 --> 01:08:11,176
They're nodding in approval, I hope.

1016
01:08:11,245 --> 01:08:13,611
They like you. Let me get them
out of there.

1017
01:08:13,747 --> 01:08:16,864
Mary-Kate, Ashley, get a life.
Thank you. Sorry.

1018
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:19,981
- Oh, they're very nice, though.
- Yeah, so are you.

1019
01:08:20,254 --> 01:08:22,381
Let me get you down slow.

1020
01:08:22,756 --> 01:08:25,190
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1021
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:51,217
All right, I just wrote this,
so go easy on me.

1022
01:08:52,286 --> 01:08:55,915
The Hukilau was the place

1023
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:59,725
Where I first saw your face

1024
01:09:01,795 --> 01:09:04,423
We liked each other right away

1025
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:10,430
But you didn't remember me
The very next day

1026
01:09:11,305 --> 01:09:15,274
Forgetful Lucy

1027
01:09:15,309 --> 01:09:18,870
Has got a nice caboose-y

1028
01:09:20,314 --> 01:09:24,512
I used to trick you into pulling
Your car over so we could chat

1029
01:09:24,818 --> 01:09:29,187
But my favorite time was when you
Beat the shit out of Ula with a bat

1030
01:09:29,823 --> 01:09:33,259
And we drove up to see Dr. Keats

1031
01:09:33,827 --> 01:09:37,194
And found out why Doug always
Has to change his sheets

1032
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:42,801
Forgetful Lucy

1033
01:09:42,836 --> 01:09:47,330
Cracked her head like Gary Busey

1034
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:50,605
But I still love her so

1035
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:55,110
And I'll never let her go

1036
01:09:56,350 --> 01:10:00,116
Even if while I'm singing this song

1037
01:10:00,854 --> 01:10:04,153
She's wishing I had
Jocko the Walrus' schlong

1038
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:10,262
Forgetful Lucy

1039
01:10:10,864 --> 01:10:15,164
Her lips are so damn juicy

1040
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:19,464
How about another first kiss

1041
01:10:29,883 --> 01:10:32,010
Can't fall asleep.

1042
01:10:32,386 --> 01:10:34,354
I'm not sleeping.

1043
01:10:34,388 --> 01:10:37,186
I'm just closing my eyes.

1044
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:39,621
Well, I'm gonna go downstairs then.

1045
01:10:39,893 --> 01:10:44,091
No, no. I'm just resting.

1046
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:47,491
Lucy.

1047
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:49,368
Yeah.

1048
01:10:49,403 --> 01:10:51,394
Will you marry me?

1049
01:10:58,912 --> 01:11:02,279
- Of course.
- Good.

1050
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:05,510
Don't forget about me.

1051
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,285
Never.

1052
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,872
Good morning.

1053
01:11:33,447 --> 01:11:34,675
Oh, shit!

1054
01:11:34,948 --> 01:11:37,109
- Help! Help!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lucy.

1055
01:11:37,144 --> 01:11:39,783
Lucy! Lucy! Hey, hey, hey.

1056
01:11:39,953 --> 01:11:42,183
I know this is hard for you
to understand...

1057
01:11:42,456 --> 01:11:44,788
...but we are actually
seeing each other.

1058
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,789
We have been for a while now.

1059
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,188
Oh! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

1060
01:11:48,462 --> 01:11:50,623
If I was lying,
how would I know this?

1061
01:11:50,964 --> 01:11:54,127
You're an art teacher and you go
to the Hukilau every Sunday...

1062
01:11:54,468 --> 01:11:58,029
...and you make waffle houses
and you like Casablanca lilies.

1063
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:01,338
- Stalker!
- No, don't you remember me a little?

1064
01:12:08,482 --> 01:12:11,212
I may not be able to kick your ass,
but my sister can.

1065
01:12:11,485 --> 01:12:12,747
Thanks, buddy.

1066
01:12:12,986 --> 01:12:15,750
Little Sammy Sosa's a bit shook up,
but she'll be okay.

1067
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:17,820
She's watching the tape as we speak.

1068
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:19,958
How's my temporal lobe
looking there, doc?

1069
01:12:19,993 --> 01:12:23,394
Don't worry. You're not gonna suffer
any short-term memory loss.

1070
01:12:23,997 --> 01:12:26,932
But was your head shaped like an egg
before she hit you?

1071
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,333
Don't make fun of Henry.
It's not his fault it's shaped like that.

1072
01:12:30,504 --> 01:12:33,871
Note the intense overreaction.
That's the "roids" talking.

1073
01:12:34,007 --> 01:12:37,704
- Doug, once again, off the juice.
- It's not juice.

1074
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:39,842
It's a protein shake.

1075
01:12:40,013 --> 01:12:43,847
Henry, the boys tell me you're setting
sail for Alaska to study walruses.

1076
01:12:44,017 --> 01:12:46,815
- When does that adventure begin?
- That actually began...

1077
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:51,047
...ten years ago. That's when I started
planning and building my boat.

1078
01:12:51,525 --> 01:12:55,655
All I know is, out of all mammals,
they have the second-largest penis.

1079
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,588
I have the first.

1080
01:13:00,534 --> 01:13:01,865
That's my joke.

1081
01:13:02,035 --> 01:13:03,832
Did you tell Lucy about this trip?

1082
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:06,005
Well...

1083
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:09,907
...actually, there's nothing to tell
because I decided not to go.

1084
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:11,840
I mean, Lucy needs me here.

1085
01:13:12,045 --> 01:13:15,242
I'm just worried about
going away for a year...

1086
01:13:15,549 --> 01:13:17,847
...and ruining all the progress
she's made.

1087
01:13:18,051 --> 01:13:19,541
I know you think I'm crazy...

1088
01:13:19,553 --> 01:13:21,316
...but I think deep down inside...

1089
01:13:21,555 --> 01:13:25,047
- ... she's starting to remember me.
- No, Henry.

1090
01:13:25,058 --> 01:13:28,619
That's what you want to believe.
It's what we all want to believe.

1091
01:13:29,563 --> 01:13:31,030
But it's never gonna happen.

1092
01:13:35,068 --> 01:13:37,195
Okay. I gotta go to work.

1093
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:40,955
Will you tell her I'll be back later
to pick her up?

1094
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:43,839
See you, guys. Don't tell anyone
your sister beat me up.

1095
01:13:44,578 --> 01:13:48,309
He could go to the moon and back and
Lucy would never even know he left.

1096
01:13:48,582 --> 01:13:51,745
Sometimes I wish my wife
had Goldfield Syndrome.

1097
01:13:52,085 --> 01:13:55,054
That way she wouldn't remember
when I called her mother...

1098
01:13:55,589 --> 01:13:59,889
...a loud, obnoxious drunk with a face
like J. Edgar Hoover's ass.

1099
01:14:02,095 --> 01:14:05,223
All right. There's your medicine,
little fellow.

1100
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:08,295
Ula! Get back to cleaning the pool!

1101
01:14:08,602 --> 01:14:12,732
If that's one of your special brownies,
don't let any of the dolphins eat that.

1102
01:14:13,106 --> 01:14:16,542
How do you think I get them to
double flip and play with white kids?

1103
01:14:20,113 --> 01:14:21,444
Okay, Willie, that's it.

1104
01:14:21,615 --> 01:14:24,209
This time try to stay clean
for more than a day.

1105
01:14:24,618 --> 01:14:26,813
I made you a nice anchovy sundae.

1106
01:14:26,848 --> 01:14:28,485
Okay, enjoy that.

1107
01:14:29,122 --> 01:14:30,589
Henry?

1108
01:14:31,124 --> 01:14:33,354
- Hey!
- How's your head?

1109
01:14:33,627 --> 01:14:36,790
- Oh, it's fine. Don't worry.
- Good.

1110
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:39,155
What brings your royal cuteness
out here?

1111
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:40,531
I needed to see you.

1112
01:14:41,134 --> 01:14:42,624
Okay. What you got there?

1113
01:14:43,136 --> 01:14:45,798
It's my journal. I write in it every night.

1114
01:14:46,139 --> 01:14:48,903
- Oh, you don't like the video?
- No, I love it.

1115
01:14:49,142 --> 01:14:53,511
It's just sometimes when I watch it,
I feel like I'm being told about my life...

1116
01:14:53,647 --> 01:14:56,115
...from someone else.
And when I read this...

1117
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:58,879
...it's like I'm telling myself.

1118
01:14:59,152 --> 01:15:00,676
When did you start this up?

1119
01:15:01,154 --> 01:15:03,088
Right after you gave me the video.

1120
01:15:03,156 --> 01:15:05,488
- Really?
- I was so nervous to come here...

1121
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:08,992
...and meet the guy that makes me
fall in love with him every day.

1122
01:15:09,663 --> 01:15:12,723
Well, you probably thought
I couldn't live up to the hype.

1123
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:16,363
No. I was nervous because...

1124
01:15:18,672 --> 01:15:20,936
Because I came here
to break up with you.

1125
01:15:22,175 --> 01:15:26,144
You had plans and a life...

1126
01:15:26,179 --> 01:15:28,909
...before you met me
and now all you have time for...

1127
01:15:29,182 --> 01:15:31,480
...is to make me fall in love with you.

1128
01:15:31,685 --> 01:15:34,620
That's not all I do.
I gave a penguin a bath today.

1129
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:39,625
Which I'll have to do again tomorrow.

1130
01:15:39,693 --> 01:15:44,323
I look at my dad and my brother's
lives and I won't do that to you.

1131
01:15:44,698 --> 01:15:49,067
What do you want me to do? Be some
chapter in your scrapbook and go?

1132
01:15:49,202 --> 01:15:50,669
No.

1133
01:15:51,705 --> 01:15:58,133
My plan is to erase you completely,
so it's as if you never existed.

1134
01:16:00,213 --> 01:16:02,340
Why are you doing this?

1135
01:16:03,216 --> 01:16:07,482
Because you have to understand
that there is no future with me.

1136
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:12,818
Don't you want to have a career
and marriage and children?

1137
01:16:13,226 --> 01:16:15,421
I asked you to marry me. You said yes.

1138
01:16:15,456 --> 01:16:17,059
Kids? Yeah, I'd love to do it.

1139
01:16:18,231 --> 01:16:21,098
But how is that going to work?

1140
01:16:21,234 --> 01:16:25,500
I'm gonna wake up every morning with
an enormous belly and no memory...

1141
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:27,036
...of how it happened?

1142
01:16:28,742 --> 01:16:32,143
I have to make a new journal
that doesn't have you in it.

1143
01:16:32,245 --> 01:16:34,042
But before I do...

1144
01:16:34,247 --> 01:16:36,977
...I really want you to read
what I wrote about you.

1145
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,115
I will read about it tomorrow...

1146
01:16:39,252 --> 01:16:42,346
...when you forget about all this
breaking up stuff, okay?

1147
01:16:42,756 --> 01:16:46,157
I'm not going to forget it.
I wrote it down. I won't let myself.

1148
01:16:46,259 --> 01:16:49,228
And I'm gonna do it whether
you want me to or not.

1149
01:16:49,763 --> 01:16:52,061
I'll be at my house.

1150
01:17:00,273 --> 01:17:02,468
Okay, type this one in there.

1151
01:17:02,776 --> 01:17:04,539
Saturday, November 25th.

1152
01:17:04,778 --> 01:17:09,579
I drove out to Callahan Institute today
and had a talk with Dr. Keats.

1153
01:17:10,283 --> 01:17:12,080
There's one about me.

1154
01:17:12,285 --> 01:17:16,483
Reminder: He makes funny noises
when I kiss his neck.

1155
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:19,257
I'm gonna miss that.

1156
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:21,487
You sure you don't want me
to put that in?

1157
01:17:30,303 --> 01:17:32,270
- We can skip that one.
- No, let me read it.

1158
01:17:32,305 --> 01:17:36,571
We made love tonight! It didn't
last long, but it was incredible.

1159
01:17:39,312 --> 01:17:43,715
It's not all about how long you go. It's...
There was a connection, I thought.

1160
01:17:45,318 --> 01:17:47,047
Actually, let's just rip that out.

1161
01:18:09,843 --> 01:18:12,209
Well, that's that.

1162
01:18:19,853 --> 01:18:21,878
Henry, wait!

1163
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:30,853
Could I have one last first kiss?

1164
01:19:42,936 --> 01:19:46,463
- I ain't gonna do this, Marlin.
- You have to, Henry.

1165
01:20:19,973 --> 01:20:23,067
I'm gonna miss you, but I gotta
get the hell off this island.

1166
01:20:23,102 --> 01:20:24,500
I'm sorry I can't take you...

1167
01:20:24,978 --> 01:20:29,005
...but you've lived here so long you're
too big of a pansy to defend yourself.

1168
01:20:30,483 --> 01:20:34,180
I don't feel bad for you. I know you
got a thing going on with Candace.

1169
01:20:37,991 --> 01:20:39,458
Candace and Bernice?

1170
01:20:41,995 --> 01:20:43,860
Candace, Bernice and Rose?

1171
01:20:45,999 --> 01:20:49,628
Yeah. I fell for one chick and I'm losing
my mind. Good luck with that.

1172
01:20:50,003 --> 01:20:51,402
Okay, baby.

1173
01:20:51,504 --> 01:20:53,165
I love you.

1174
01:20:53,506 --> 01:20:55,974
Thanks, buddy.
Remember to use a condom.

1175
01:20:56,509 --> 01:20:58,500
Or in your case, a Hefty bag.

1176
01:21:09,022 --> 01:21:10,455
Well...

1177
01:21:10,523 --> 01:21:13,617
Okay, you guys. Thanks for coming
to say goodbye.

1178
01:21:14,027 --> 01:21:15,722
Be careful.

1179
01:21:16,029 --> 01:21:18,964
You make sure your father doesn't
get eaten by a shark.

1180
01:21:25,538 --> 01:21:28,473
Thank you, buddy.
What does that mean again?

1181
01:21:29,042 --> 01:21:30,839
Bring me back a T-shirt.

1182
01:21:31,044 --> 01:21:33,376
Oh, okay. You got it.

1183
01:21:34,047 --> 01:21:36,242
Come here. All right. Love you guys.

1184
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,985
My shirt size is medium husky.

1185
01:21:42,055 --> 01:21:44,353
Hey! Kikikuloa!

1186
01:21:44,557 --> 01:21:47,355
No flippies off the dock!
You could get hurt!

1187
01:21:50,063 --> 01:21:54,932
No! All right. Let the master
show you how to get it done.

1188
01:22:03,076 --> 01:22:06,705
Now you kids go down there
and find my nuts.

1189
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,911
Sure you don't want to take Doug?

1190
01:22:09,082 --> 01:22:12,711
Hey! What the heck
are you guys doing here?

1191
01:22:13,086 --> 01:22:17,648
I spoke to the harbormaster and he
said you were setting sail today...

1192
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:19,820
...so we thought we'd wish
you bon voyage.

1193
01:22:20,093 --> 01:22:23,085
This is from Nick and Sue.
They send their best wishes.

1194
01:22:23,596 --> 01:22:27,430
That's very nice.
Spam and Reese's. All right.

1195
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,000
I love Spam and Reese's.
Can I have it?

1196
01:22:30,103 --> 01:22:31,695
I guess.

1197
01:22:32,605 --> 01:22:34,698
- Doug!
- That's all right.

1198
01:22:34,733 --> 01:22:37,633
- I'm sorry.
- So...

1199
01:22:38,611 --> 01:22:39,873
...how's Lucy?

1200
01:22:40,613 --> 01:22:43,343
Actually, she's living at the institute.

1201
01:22:44,117 --> 01:22:47,484
- When did that happen?
- Three weeks ago.

1202
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:51,852
Said she didn't want to be a burden to
me and Doug anymore. I don't know.

1203
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:54,593
I couldn't talk her out of it.
You know what?

1204
01:22:54,627 --> 01:22:56,822
She's doing really great up there.

1205
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:00,190
She's teaching an art class
and she gets to paint every day.

1206
01:23:00,633 --> 01:23:02,464
In fact, she's even singing again.

1207
01:23:02,635 --> 01:23:04,830
Hey, look, I got a little gift
for you too.

1208
01:23:05,138 --> 01:23:08,938
It's just a little something
from one sailor to another one.

1209
01:23:10,643 --> 01:23:12,577
You take care of yourself out there.

1210
01:23:13,146 --> 01:23:15,580
- I will.
- Okay.

1211
01:23:24,157 --> 01:23:26,091
Henry did not tell me about you.

1212
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,753
Your fisherman muscles.

1213
01:23:29,662 --> 01:23:30,924
Can I touch?

1214
01:23:31,164 --> 01:23:32,995
Sure.

1215
01:23:38,671 --> 01:23:40,605
Yes.

1216
01:23:48,181 --> 01:23:49,478
The Beach Boys?

1217
01:23:49,682 --> 01:23:52,549
How nice of him to give me a CD
that will remind me...

1218
01:23:53,186 --> 01:23:56,644
...of all the wonderful times
I shared with his daughter.

1219
01:23:56,689 --> 01:23:59,089
What an asshole!

1220
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:19,735
Oh, why?

1221
01:24:20,213 --> 01:24:22,545
Why would you do this to me?

1222
01:24:22,715 --> 01:24:25,240
You sick bastard!

1223
01:24:29,722 --> 01:24:31,280
Oh, my God.

1224
01:24:32,225 --> 01:24:34,159
Is he trying to tell me something?

1225
01:24:38,731 --> 01:24:41,165
She only sings on days
she meets you.

1226
01:24:43,236 --> 01:24:45,204
She remembers me?

1227
01:24:45,738 --> 01:24:47,330
Holy shit!

1228
01:24:48,741 --> 01:24:51,505
She remembers me!

1229
01:24:56,749 --> 01:24:58,666
Julia, that looks great.

1230
01:24:58,701 --> 01:25:00,583
Excuse me. What am I doing?

1231
01:25:01,254 --> 01:25:04,519
You're painting a picture.
And you're doing an excellent job.

1232
01:25:04,757 --> 01:25:06,384
Oh.

1233
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,786
Holy crap! I suck.

1234
01:25:19,272 --> 01:25:20,967
Hey, hey, hey.

1235
01:25:21,274 --> 01:25:24,107
- Can we help you, sir?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

1236
01:25:24,277 --> 01:25:26,711
- What's your name?
- My name?

1237
01:25:29,282 --> 01:25:32,479
Dude, he forgot his name.
I feel bad for him.

1238
01:25:32,785 --> 01:25:35,686
Just go on up. And good luck
with that memory problem.

1239
01:25:35,788 --> 01:25:37,779
Yeah. Thank you.

1240
01:25:39,792 --> 01:25:41,089
What?

1241
01:25:41,794 --> 01:25:43,887
Lucy!

1242
01:25:44,297 --> 01:25:45,992
Lucy!

1243
01:25:46,299 --> 01:25:48,949
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hey, I met you before. I'm Henry.

1244
01:25:48,984 --> 01:25:51,599
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for Lucy Whitmore.

1245
01:25:51,804 --> 01:25:53,328
Any idea where I can find her?

1246
01:25:53,806 --> 01:25:54,772
Hi, I'm Tom.

1247
01:25:54,807 --> 01:25:57,776
Oh. Thanks anyways.

1248
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:00,676
Lucy!

1249
01:26:01,314 --> 01:26:02,781
Lucy!

1250
01:26:06,819 --> 01:26:08,582
Lucy Whitmore...

1251
01:26:09,822 --> 01:26:11,687
...can I ask you a question?

1252
01:26:14,827 --> 01:26:17,022
Do you have any idea who I am?

1253
01:26:23,336 --> 01:26:26,499
- No.
- No?

1254
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,865
That sucks.

1255
01:26:31,344 --> 01:26:34,336
- What's your name?
- I'm Henry.

1256
01:26:34,847 --> 01:26:36,610
Henry.

1257
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,717
I want to show you something.
Will you come with me?

1258
01:26:41,354 --> 01:26:42,753
Well, yeah.

1259
01:26:44,357 --> 01:26:46,291
Hey. Do you know who that guy is?

1260
01:26:46,359 --> 01:26:48,520
Dude, I don't even know who I am.

1261
01:26:48,861 --> 01:26:51,125
Oh, well, you're Pablo Picasso.

1262
01:26:51,364 --> 01:26:55,061
- Really?
- No. Not really.

1263
01:26:58,371 --> 01:27:01,033
This is my studio.

1264
01:27:20,393 --> 01:27:23,055
I don't know who you are, Henry...

1265
01:27:24,897 --> 01:27:28,833
...but I dream about you
almost every night.

1266
01:27:31,404 --> 01:27:32,928
Why?

1267
01:27:33,406 --> 01:27:37,467
What would you say if I told you
that notebook you read every day...

1268
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:40,936
...used to have a lot of stuff
about me in it?

1269
01:27:42,415 --> 01:27:45,009
I would say that that
makes a lot of sense.

1270
01:27:45,418 --> 01:27:47,215
You erased me
from your memories...

1271
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:50,583
...because you thought you were
holding me back from having...

1272
01:27:50,923 --> 01:27:52,652
...a full and happy life.

1273
01:27:52,925 --> 01:27:55,416
But you made a mistake.

1274
01:27:55,928 --> 01:27:59,557
Being with you is the only way
I could have a full and happy life.

1275
01:28:00,433 --> 01:28:02,697
You're the girl of my dreams...

1276
01:28:02,935 --> 01:28:06,701
...and apparently I'm the man of yours.

1277
01:28:11,444 --> 01:28:13,207
Henry.

1278
01:28:13,446 --> 01:28:14,845
It's nice to meet you.

1279
01:28:15,448 --> 01:28:18,440
Lucy, it's nice to meet you too.

1280
01:28:22,955 --> 01:28:24,923
Hi, I'm Tom.

1281
01:28:24,957 --> 01:28:27,118
Henry, Lucy. Nice to meet you, Tom.

1282
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:31,089
Now why don't you come back in
ten seconds so we can meet again?

1283
01:29:16,509 --> 01:29:20,104
Do you, Honah Lee, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

1284
01:29:20,139 --> 01:29:22,378
...to have and to hold
from this day forth...

1285
01:29:23,015 --> 01:29:25,108
...as long as you both shall live?

1286
01:29:25,143 --> 01:29:26,985
- I do.
- Really?

1287
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,715
Even though in, like, 10, 15 years...

1288
01:29:30,022 --> 01:29:32,718
...she could possibly let herself
go and then, like...

1289
01:29:32,753 --> 01:29:34,891
...sex could be, like,
nauseating for you?

1290
01:29:35,027 --> 01:29:37,723
What are you, nuts?
Your wife's right over there.

1291
01:29:40,032 --> 01:29:41,761
I'm just kidding, Muumuu!

1292
01:29:42,034 --> 01:29:44,901
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1293
01:29:50,042 --> 01:29:52,510
Mazel tov!

1294
01:29:53,546 --> 01:29:55,639
It's very cold, so when you're ready...

1295
01:29:56,048 --> 01:29:59,677
...put on a jacket and come have
breakfast with me. Love you.

1296
01:30:31,584 --> 01:30:36,681
Hey, hey! Good morning, Mrs. Roth.
Would you like to meet your daughter?

1297
01:30:37,089 --> 01:30:38,351
Go say hello to Mommy.

1298
01:30:40,092 --> 01:30:41,753
Hi, Mommy.

1299
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,087
That's right.

1300
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,227
Good morning.

1301
01:30:51,103 --> 01:30:53,264
Oh, my goodness!

1302
01:30:54,106 --> 01:30:56,438
- Grandpa's here.
- Hi, Dad.
