1
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,807
Oh, wow.

2
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:10,645
I mean, that was
the only tlme

3
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:13,277
I ever felt
sure about anythlng.

4
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:16,720
My whole life never seems
to catch up to that moment.

5
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:18,484
But to be unsure...

6
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:22,189
I don't know.

7
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,853
What If there's
no reason In your life

8
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,226
to feel shltty,
but you do anyway?

9
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:26,492
No enemy to polnt at.

10
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,792
Would he do that? I

11
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,565
I mean, I look at all
the people around me and-

12
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:32,797
Gabe?

13
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:35,171
What are you dolng?

14
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:39,508
You can go In there for hours,
but you can't do anythlng else?

15
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:40,739
Thls Is bullshlt.

16
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:51,820
But my whole life never seems
to catch up to that moment.

17
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,986
I mean, what If you have
no reason to feel shltty,

18
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:56,653
but you do anyway?

19
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,823
Everythlng's your
fucklng enemy.

20
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,096
Let's back up.

21
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:05,603
How does thls play start?

22
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,310
# When you wake up #

23
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,404

# Fllled wlth souls #

00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:04,063
# Some strange purse #

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:10,000
# Stuffed nervous wlth gold #

29
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:12,936
# Can you be where
You want to be? #

30
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:20,913
# Walk down any street #

31
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:25,918
# You can flnd #

32
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,853
# Look at any clock #

# Slng some strange verse #

00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:42,631
# From some
Strange song of vlnes #

36
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:45,694
# And you'll be
Where you want to be #

37
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:51,708
# I know I can't slng ##

38
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:54,803
Hey, are you sweating
in crazy places?

39
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,111
I'm talking to you about the
deadline, because right now,

40
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,946
your ass should be
sweating in crazy places.

41
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,646
Can you dig it?

42
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,812
H i, Rocky. Good
morning, and how are you?

43
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,446
What dld you say?

44
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:05,354
I'm saying that every
little sweat gland

45
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,153
in your body should be on
sweaty overdrive right now

46
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,457
because of these plans
right here on your desk.

47
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,793
Gabrlel, llsten, man, you've

00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:14,898

00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,466

I'm almost...

59
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,860
# Having rough sex #

60
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:43,987
Hello, Diamond Records.

61
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,224
Cari Skaught's office.

62
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:48,165
Princess Leia, please?

63
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:52,170
Prlncess Lela...

64
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:54,229
Chewbacca Richmond
on one.

65
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,002
Hey, Zoom.

66
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:58,203
Hey, hey, hey.
Do you thlnk

67
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:01,247
that men are innately boring and
insensitive compared to women?

68
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:02,713
Do you?

69
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:07,884
# You are my fetlsh, fetlsh #

70
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:09,717
Hey, what movle
dld you see?

71
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:13,555
U h, uh, Startlng Over
with, uh, Burt Reynolds.

72
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:14,685
U h...

73
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,290
Are you serious?

74
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,694
All right, all right, wait.

75
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:20,062
J- J ust listen, listen, listen.

76
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,896
Here is the realization.

77
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:25,870
I think that women are
naturally giving creatures,

78
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:28,305
and I think that
a man's nature

79
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:31,866
is to, uh, to take advantage
of that, of that kindness.

80
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,209
Zoom I No, walt,
you got all thls

81
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,214
from a movie about Burt
Reynolds and a chimp?

82
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,546
Am I keeping you
from something?

83
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,087
Actually, I do have a
transvestite punk band

84
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:43,986
here in the office.

85
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,887
Thelr new album Is called Rock My Labia,

86
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,950
and It's chock-full of
thls klnd of Inslght.

87
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:50,795
Oh, no. Oh,
wait a second.

88
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:52,455
U h, I got to
go, legally.

89
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,055
U h, llsten, Zoom,
can I talk to you

90
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:55,601
later about thls?
'Cause, uh...

91
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:56,931
Yeah, okay. J
- J ust one last thing.

92
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,994
A play. A play.

93
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:01,733
I am gonna write a play
about all this stuff.

94
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,503
Great I Wrlte one,

95
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,009
and I'll definitely be
there to see it. Okay.

96
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,442
Love you, Zoom.
Got to go.

97
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,140
Okay, you go
rock your labia,

98
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,613
but you brushing me off
and hanging up on me,

99
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:11,947
it's gonna be
in the play.

100
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:13,952
So baslcally you have these
dlfferent women, you know,

101
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,817
and this man.

102
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:18,413
And, so y-you know how women,
um, can kind of, uh, be

103
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,016
very n-naturally
kind of forgiving,

104
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,254
and men take advantage
of-of that and everything.

105
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,126
And men will hide
themselves in women

106
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,597
and-and they allow it,
because they're just...

107
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,271
Are you out
of your mind?

108
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:34,931
You're asking me
to represent you,

109
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,635
and you haven't
written a word?

110
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,837
I have not written
a word, no, but-but...

111
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,936
Gabriel, I love
you, honestly I do.

112
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:44,108
But I represent serious
playwrights, not schmucks.

113
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:45,481
It all starts
with the writing.

114
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,019
Right, right.

115
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,883
But I thought
if I told you the idea

116
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,216
and you liked the idea...

117
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:51,984
Gabriel, a
writer writes.

118
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,525
No offense, but if you
want to be a writer,

119
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:55,560
why don't you go
to writing school?

120
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,129
Hey, I wanna be an astronaut;
you wanna represent me?

121
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:58,494
I mean, come on.

122
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:00,396
You come to
me with an idea.

123
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,730
I can't represent
an idea.

124
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:04,394
And by the way,
I'm not really sure

125
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,233
whether I
understand this idea.

126
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,738
I know it involves a
woman, th-there's a message,

127
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:09,502
there's a-a
looking glass.

128
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,407
Wrlte It.

129
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:12,500
What I would do...

130
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:13,637
If-

131
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,037
Excuse me.

132
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,249
Yeah?

133
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,023
# I have dreamt
Of a place In tlme #

134
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:39,504
# Where nobody gets annoyed #

135
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:42,541
# But I must admlt #

136
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,702
# I'm not there yet #

137
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:47,804
# But somethlng's
Keeplng me golng #

138
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:50,213
# Maybe there's a world
That I'm stlll to flnd #

139
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:57,019
# Maybe there's a world
That I'm stlll to flnd #

140
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,356
# Open up a world
And let me In #

141
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:05,363
# Then there'll be
A new life to begln #

142
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:11,237
I think you
should tell her,

143
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:13,636
you know, 'cause
she loves you.

144
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,708
I couldn't.
She'd be so mad.

145
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,208
No, no, it'll
be fine.

146
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:18,642
You just say- oh.

147
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:20,212
She's your wlfe.

148
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,080
Hello, lovely.

149
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,252
Hello.

150
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:39,230
Listen, she's been bugging me
to go, uh, home and everything.

151
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,732
And so I think I-

152
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,233
She-she might have
lupus, I think.

153
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:43,326
Oh.

154
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:45,030
Yeah.

155
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:46,162
Well, too bad. Winston
can take her home.

156
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:47,739
You can stay.

157
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:49,240
Fine by me.
I like Winston.

158
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:51,072
M m.
See?

159
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:52,168
Ugh.

160
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,310
Listen, I
don't know.

161
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:56,848
I keep trying to keep it
together, but at this point,

162
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,315
I think I'm
doing more harm

163
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:01,751
than good by
belng here.

164
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:04,081
All right.

165
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:05,590
But just one minute.

166
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,455
I- There's this
woman down there,

167
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,017
she's one of our biggest
donors. Next to Winston.

168
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:10,186
Wlll you just
please say hello?

169
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:11,354
Okay.

170
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:13,092
Want to come?

171
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,190
Nah. I'll meet you at
the fountain, okay?

172
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:15,291
Okay.

173
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:16,357
Love you, Mom.

174
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:17,630
What about me?

175
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:18,830
See you later.
You, too.

176
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:21,198
See you.

177
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:22,331
Okay.

178
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:37,655
Want some help?

179
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:42,218
No, thanks.

180
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:45,661
Yeah.
Quarters.

181
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:47,393
There it is,
there it is, there it is,

182
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,524
there It Is.

183
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:50,227
There you go.

184
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:51,462
Thank you, thank you.

185
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:52,561
Ooh, yeah!

186
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:54,162
I thought you said

187
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,901
you'd meet me
at the fountain?

188
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,308
I'm sorry
I got wet.

189
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,313
But you were nice
to him, too, you know.

190
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,178
Sending him into the party
to get food and stuff.

191
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:04,807
That's different,
you know.

192
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:06,909
I mean, you know, he
was, he was hungry.

193
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,851
There we go!

194
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:09,980
"M ilner, " Daddy?

195
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,080
That's right.

196
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,748
What's a milner?

197
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,190
One who...

198
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,852
I don't know.
It's Scrabble.

199
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,260
You're not supposed
to know what it means.

200
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,591
Look, I-I let you
use " Lassie. "

201
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:19,859
It's a word.

202
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,025
It's a dog.

203
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,501
Christy's mom broke up
with her girlfriend again.

204
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:28,233
Really?

205
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:30,206
I thlnk she really
means It thls tlme.

206
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:31,368
She moved in with Ms. Weaver,
our new Home Ec teacher.

207
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:32,843
You and Mom met her.

208
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:34,209
How do you
keep up wlth

209
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,872
the soap opera of it all?

210
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,678
I thought that she was seeing the, um,

211
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,274
the dykey basketball coach or something.

212
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:40,443
Dad, the
word's "lesbian. "

213
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:42,282
You should know that.

214
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:44,356
It could get you a triple
word score over there.

215
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:45,948
All rlght, well,

216
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:47,287
you go ahead.

217
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:50,885
You're wiping
me out here.

218
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:52,295
Okay.

219
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:53,626
Dad, why
were you sad

220
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,030
at Mom's party?

221
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,772
You got to
stop lettlng her

222
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:04,208
stay up so late
on school nlghts.

223
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:05,869
Oh, come on.

224
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:08,209
We were just playing a little Scrabble,

225
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,545
waiting for you
and- you know.

226
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:13,210
It's educational.

227
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:15,379
U h-huh.

228
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:19,391
You know, when you have to
leave early like tonlght,

229
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,394
is supporting me
even a thought?

230
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,760
Yeah, sure
it's a thought.

231
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:26,560
No, look,
I'm-I'm sorry.

232
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:28,327
You know how I get
at those thlngs.

233
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:29,924
I mean, I just

234
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,402
klnd of freak out
a llttle blt.

235
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,904
How'd the rest
of the night go?

236
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,270
Good. Fine.

237
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,808
I'm glad I
hlred Wlnston.

238
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:39,400
I'd have gone crazy
without Winston.

239
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,913
Yeah, Winston-
he's a good guy.

240
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:44,006
I was thinking about
setting him up with Cari.

241
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:45,744
If you want
to do that to hlm.

242
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:47,581
You just said
he was great.

243
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:49,917
He is, but she's...

244
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,752
You know, she'd either
get bored or...

245
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:53,587
The guys she
dates are losers.

246
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:56,287
Good point.

247
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,455
Hey, why don't you, uh,
why don't you come to bed?

248
00:11:58,531 --> 00:11:59,520
We can do a little

249
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:00,599
performance art.

250
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:06,430
Are you ready
for Colorado?

251
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:08,633
U h, yeah, yeah.

252
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,804
It's, uh...

253
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,643
I don't know. I mean, do
you really think I should go?

254
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:18,149
J ust the way I've been
feeling and everything-

255
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:21,380
Maybe we could do Christmas in New York.

256
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:25,787
We go to my family's every year
for my father, you know that.

257
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:28,952
And it's always
weird for you.

258
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,393
Is this about
my family?

259
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:31,862
No, no, no.

260
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,363
'Cause if this is
about my family-

261
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:34,490
No, no, no. Listen,
I- I'm sorry.

262
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,159
I don't mean that.

263
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:37,361
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

264
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,166
I just, uh,
you know,

265
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:43,675
I just don't...

266
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:46,507
I don't want
to be a...

267
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:49,241
prick to be
around, you know.

268
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:55,344
H mm. Funny, that's never
a concern of yours before.

269
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:27,511

that you're a flake.

283
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:11,096
Did I say that
he was a flake?

284
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:13,155
No, you sald he was
sort of a pathetlc boner

285
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,733
for seeing a movie
during work.

286
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,563
Oh, boner, boner!

287

That's nlce In front

No, I mean, I
think it's great.

289
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,135
It just can be great and pathetic.

Well, you know, I know It's
a llttle welrd and everythlng,

The ladies were just feeding me crow.

00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:55,435
Good. I like that.

306

Oh. See a movie

322
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,129
Oh.

323
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,175
Yeah.

324
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:31,232
Scared.

325
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,277
Absolutely.

326
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:33,334
Ooh.

327
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,176
So, Cari...

328
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:38,979
Oh, no. I, uh...

329
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,814
What? I'm not
that bad, am I?

330
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:42,854
Yenta!

331
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,753
No, it's just I
have this friend

332
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:46,256
that I thought you might
be interested in meeting.

333
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:47,314
Who?

334
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:48,655
Lord Wlnston.

335
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:50,161
Royalty?

336
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:52,595
Winston Lee
Attenborough,

337
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,825
and he is my
new assistant curator.

338
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,834
And he's really cute.

339
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:59,666
Come on, Lizzie, back me up
here. He's cute, right?

340
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:02,606
He Is, Dad,
he just Is.

341
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,700
I suppose If Llzzle likes
hlm, I should just marry hlm.

342
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:07,678
Good.

343
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:10,682
No, actually, uh,
can't do it, guys,

344
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,843
'cause I'm moving in with someone.

345
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:14,715
You what?

346
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:16,379
What?

347
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,446
Yeah, the
dancer, right?

348
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:20,422
Walt, walt, walt, hold
on. Hold on, dancer, like,

349
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:21,754
stripper dancer? You're
moving in with a stripper?

350
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,590
Shh! What kind
of dancer?

351
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:25,721
Ballet. You know, the
guy she met at that party?

352
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:28,232
Wait. No, no, not Sushi the dancer?

353
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:30,701
Sachi, schmuck!

354
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,203
What, are
you deaf?

355
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:34,569
How do you say his name? Sushi?

356
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,540
No, I mean, you know, this is why.

357
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:39,043
This is why I didn't
want to tell you guys.

358
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,477
It's, like, the relationship's
in its first trimester,

359
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,538
and you know,
I knew

360
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,311
you guys would get all serious
about it and give me shit.

361
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:47,386
Well, you're the

362
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,080
only person I know that would
just move in with somebody

363
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:50,417
rather than have
a second date.

364
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,889
Yeah, dating. Yuck.

365
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,256
I think it's great.
And he's a lucky guy.

366
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,057
Yeah.

367
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:59,063
All right.

368
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,429
It is
present time!

369
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,592
# Da da-da da! #

370
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:05,068
Thank you.

371
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:06,399
And for our own

372
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:07,564
Diane Arbus
in training.

373
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,902
Thank you.

374
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:11,272
Oh...
Cari, you remembered.

375
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,836
Thank you.

376
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,608
U h, yours isn't
here yet.

377
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:20,247
Shershi...

378
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,914
You're gonna
get it.

379
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:29,821
So, Zoom, what Is all
thls about, really?

380
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,695
The-the play, the
movies, everything.

381
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,925
Do you know?

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,627
No, I don't.

383
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,795
Well, what does it
feel like?

384
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,771
You know what it is?

385
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,536
It's sort of the opposite
of what it might seem like.

386
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:46,805
I mean, I... I know
that I should be happy,

387
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,312
but... I don't know.

388
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:50,110
You know, there's
this weird thing

389
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:51,809
that happens when
you have a kid.

390
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:54,148
You just simply do
not allow yourself

391
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,486
to even consider being
anything but happy.

392
00:17:58,557 --> 00:17:59,956
J ust... that's it.

393
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:01,617
Going to be happy
and everything.

394
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,787
But I don't know-
I mean, I...

395
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:07,321
when I look back,
you know, and I...

396
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,301
I... you know, I watch
myself step into this life,

397
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,837
and it just kind of feels
like I'm full of shit.

398
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:14,167
What's full of shit?

399
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,901
Full of shit,
like how?

400
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:18,636
Like... like... like
your life is living you

401
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:22,169
instead of the other way around?

402
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:23,681
Is this about
you and Annie?

403
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:25,649
Oh, God, no.
I wish.

404
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,379
That'd make it
so much easier.

405
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,420
I would know what to do, you know?

406
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,114
But, uh... what?

407
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,351
Ah, no, wait.

408
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,350
Obviously, everything
is great.

409
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,761
God.

410
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:40,229
I have an idea.

411
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:42,163
I enjoy. Feel
comfortable. What?

412
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,702
Why don't you get into
the shopping cart?

413
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,637
All right.

414
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:49,606
All right, you can
take the bottle.

415
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:51,832
Here.

416
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:52,900
All right.

417
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:54,673
Take the bottle.

418
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,442
Okay. What are we doing?
Where are we going?

419
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:58,107
We're gonna go
on an adventure.

420
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:59,684
We're looking for joy,
bliss and identity.

421
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:01,117
Joy, bliss,
here we come.

422
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,448
All right.

423
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:03,453
Where are we
going, Zoom?

424
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,716
Thls way.

425
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,018
We're golng thls way?

426
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:11,225
You want to know...
you want to know

427
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:13,026
what my play is
gonna be about?

428
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:15,566
It's going to be about
this evil, vicious woman

429
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:18,034
who, uh, pushes
her best friend-

430
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:21,072
this man in a cart- and
then, while it's crashing,

431
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,802
she makes no attempt
to help him at all,

432
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:26,207
but instead rescues
the bottle of booze.

433
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:31,075
And I suppose
that you are this man.

434
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,986
That's me- that'd
be me in the play.

435
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:39,889
Listen, I mean, this
really doesn't have anything

436
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,893
to do with anything,
but I think I might

437
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,259
have crossed a line
with Lauren at work.

438
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,891
What?

439
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:50,663
What line? Where?

440
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:52,396
Well, no, no, it's not the line.

441
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,234
I mean, this isn't
about cheating.

442
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:57,002
It... oh, fuck.

443
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:58,906
Cheating.

444
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:00,741
No, that's not me.

445
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:03,441
Wow. And-And you
don't think that-

446
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:07,646
all of this is
about that?

447
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:10,586
But how could it not
be confusing you?

448
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:12,954
I mean, either you
and Lauren are friends,

449
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:15,016
or you are more.

450
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,526
M mm.

451
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:17,857
Touching her vagina
is not nothing.

452
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,954
Oh! Oh!

453
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:20,089
It's not nothing.

454
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:21,530
Shh, shh.

455
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,602
Vagina touching
equals confusion.

456
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:25,261
You know, okay,
okay, I got it.

457
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:27,771
Thanks.
Jesus.

458
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:31,275
Look at me.

459
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:32,708
Look at me.
Come on.

460
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,644
Now, do you
really think that...

461
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:41,380
that this is about, uh, vagina touching?

462
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:42,476
Come on.

463
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:53,658
You know what I think
you should call your play?

464
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,393
H mm?

465
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:57,969
"Trying to Find Myself
in a Friend's Vagina. "

466
00:20:58,037 --> 00:20:59,971
Shut up.

467
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,904
You stay out of
my friend's vagina.

468
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:04,805
You shut up and stay out
of your friend's vagina.

469
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:07,505
Well... I should
stay out altogether.

470
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,844
You vagina-you
got none vagina.

471
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,493
What?

472
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:25,758
Okay, so I wanted
to give this to you

473
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,832
when the moment
was just right.

474
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,334
When we found more uses
for the word "vagina"

475
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:33,929
than I ever have
before in my life, okay?

476
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,336
Here.

477
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,669
What?

478
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:38,334
Your present.

479
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,344
You know, write your fucking play, Zoom.

480
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,380
This will record
your journey.

481
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:52,955
Wow. Wow.
This is amazing.

482
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:55,686
This is so cool.

483
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:00,455
Thank you.
Thank you.

484
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:02,227
You're welcome.

485
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:05,535
Like this?

486
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:07,595
U p on your toes.

487
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:08,968
Let the water get all
the way down In the gulch.

488
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:11,099
So, like that?

489
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,973
Little soap. Yes.

490
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:14,409
Yes, yes, and you don't
want faulty presentation.

491
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,970
Right. What do
you hold on to?

492
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:18,549
U h, 12: 00- tarantula.

493
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:19,982
Oh.

494
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:21,916
I can tell
from the pose

495
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:24,080
that you fellas are feverishly
at work on my project.

496
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:25,748
Actually, we are

497
00:22:25,824 --> 00:22:27,917
absolutely not at work on your project.

498
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:29,551
Especially him.

499
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:31,596
Can I ask how
funny thls looks?

500
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:33,325
Pretty darn.

501
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:35,423
I mean, I know why I
put up with you guys,

502
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:37,935
but how are you dealing
with your other clients?

503
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:40,301
He's not. Everybody's
plssed at hlm.

504
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:42,567
Anyway, good-bye,
Gabe.

505
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:43,903
Good-bye, Lauren.

506
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:45,341
U h-huh.

507
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:48,572
Ah, he just...
he...

508
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,274
ah, he's just a
sick bastard.

509
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,943
You know, he's
showing me the, uh...

510
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:55,578
the shower thingy,
you know?

511
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:58,623
Now, wait a minute-
you're... you're here.

512
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:01,626
Yeah. We're having lunch.

513
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:04,128
Right. Right.

514
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,825
The live one.

515
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,525
The live one you've named
three times already, Lauren.

516
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:10,932
Okay, you name
five Kl S S records.

517
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,163
Okay, I will.

518
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:13,829
No, don't.
Never mind.

519
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:15,964
J ust show me one adult woman who could.

520
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:18,100
Okay.

521
00:23:18,177 --> 00:23:21,772
Ten Ryan O' Neal movies.

522
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:24,645
Ten Ryan O' Neal
mo... whoa.

523
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:25,979
This is so easy.

524
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,484
I'm going to get you started.

525
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:29,612
Love Story,
Ollver's Story.

526
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,952
Ah, see, this is why I hate
playing this game with you-

527
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:33,548
'cause you won't even let me guess.

528
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,217
And I had one, too-
a really good one.

529
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,124
The one with the, uh...
the bare-ass jeans.

530
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:39,027
And you asked
me how I was.

531
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:40,894
Well, we... we got way
too much going on right now

532
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:43,126
for me to think about how
I am, but it's not good.

533
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:45,796
U h, but llsten, you were-you
were supposed to take me

534
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,339
to lunch, and I'm eating
pizza out of my bare hand.

535
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:50,341
Pizza and Ryan O' Neal-
what the fuck?

536
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:51,808
I can tell

537
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,742
you're trying not
to "talk-talk. "

538
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:55,040
Llsten, thls has nothlng to do wlth us.

539
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:56,705
Everything is
fine, and...

540
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:58,077
and I have absolutely
no reason to feel-

541
00:23:58,183 --> 00:23:59,207
But you do.

542
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:00,751
Yeah, but-

543
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:02,343
All I ever hear
from you Is,

544
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,888
" I have no reason
to feel this way, "

545
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:05,854
" I have no excuse
to feel that way. "

546
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:07,915
Haven't you learned anything
from being a New Yorker?

547
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,687
I mean, slnce when do we need
a reason to do anythlng?

548
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:11,354
You feel shltty,
you feel shltty.

549
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,159
Well, I'm afraid this
is a little bit more

550
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:15,666
all-encompassing than
just feeling shitty.

551
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:17,725
Hey. Okay, you
are taking me

552
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:19,360
to my energy enthusiast
appointment right now.

553
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,269
I should make you
get a treatment.

554
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:22,772
Your what?

555
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,775
Actually, you should.
I'm worried.

556
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:26,174
J ust trust me.

557
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,610
Yeah, okay.

558
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,180
I'm... I'm up
for anything.

559
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:33,708
Here.

560
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:34,946
Hey, Silvia.

561
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:36,179
Hey.

562
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:37,119
Can I go
right back?

563
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:38,588
Sure.

564
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,631
I'm just here to do
a little energy work.

565
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:59,635
Yeah, you know, just charge
the batteries a little bit.

566
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:05,240
Yeah.

567
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:08,377
Get some juice.

568
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:10,887
You know.

569
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,385
All righty, then.

570
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:20,155
Gabriel.

571
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:56,429
Who are we
seeing tonight?

572
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,594
A band called
Vulvic N uisance.

573
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,537
They're actually
a punk-funk band.

574
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,198
And they're
the latest rage.

575
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:04,366
Says who?

576
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,137
Says ages
18 to 25.

577
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:08,304
Actually, I signed
them in a drunken stupor

578
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,938
and now I can't
get rid of them.

579
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:11,778
They're in my office every day.

580
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:14,881
So tell
me something-

581
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:17,285
is that dad of yours ever
gonna write that play?

582
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:18,823
I think it's going
to be a hit.

583
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,290
You do, huh?

584
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:24,125
Me, too.

585
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:30,567
Do you think Mom and Dad are all right?

586
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:33,001
I think so.

587
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:35,733
I hope so.

588
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:41,802
U h-oh, look.

589
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,816
All right, don't
move a muscle.

590
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:49,980
Someone has to put that
mime out of our misery.

591
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:51,579
Oh, no.

592
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:53,181
Oh.

593
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:55,317
Oh, you got a hole
in your pants, mime.

594
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:56,986
I nappropriate.

595
00:26:58,664 --> 00:26:59,528
So what do you think of this place?

596
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:00,929
It's okay.

597
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,261
Wow, how fucking
old are you?

598
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:03,834
Twelve.

599
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:07,497
Wicked!

600
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:11,508
A little over
a decade.

601
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:14,204
How come guys act
so stupid like that?

602
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,215
You mean, besides being
piss drunk and retarded?

603
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:21,013
Well, not just him-
like all guys.

604
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:23,611
Llke, guys In my class
act like that, too.

605
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:25,781
Most of them
aren't drunk.

606
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:27,688
Are we talking about
somebody in particular?

607
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,056
Maybe.

608
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:30,685
Maybe?

609
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:32,389
All right, here's what you have to do-

610
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:35,058
you have to see if the guy is an ass

611
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,361
or if he's just
being an ass.

612
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:37,868
Oy, Rlggsl

613
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:39,961
Go away, chlef.

614
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,370
I'm coming over there
to smell your fingers.

615
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:48,038
Yeah, I think
you'll just know.

616
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:51,708
Boys and glrls,
Vulvlc N ulsancel

617
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,380

I like your band.

622
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:20,803
# Get off #

623
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:24,439
# Having rough sex #

624
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:27,508
What do you think
they're doing?

625
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:29,746
They're probably
skating or dancing,

626
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:34,451
'cause Sushi's turned Cari into
quite the ballet aficionado.

627
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:37,893
M m. Yeah, definitely.

628
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:39,931
Yup, they're at the ballet with Sushi.

629
00:28:39,998 --> 00:28:41,124
Yeah.

630
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:45,363
# You are my fetish #

631
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,166
# Gaze down ##

632
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:54,268
Is this ready to go?

633
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:55,779
H mm?

634
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:58,111
That suitcase-
is it ready?

635
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:02,051
M m, yeah. Yeah.

636
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:04,315
What time are you

637
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:06,482
When?

638

Oh, uh, no,

641
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:16,126
I thought if you didn't finish
the revisions, you couldn't go.

642
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:19,136
No.

643
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:35,584
Okay, where to begln?

00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:46,361
I n Colorado, at grad
school, I met sweet Annle.

647
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:49,491
And then, bam,
I'm an archltect,

648
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:53,436
a father, a
husband, and...

649
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:57,372
Wow, man, Ellzabeth.

650
00:29:57,442 --> 00:30:00,377
That's the only tlme
I've really been sure

651
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:03,346
about anythlng,
totally present.

652
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:14,190
My whole life never seems
to catch up to that moment.

653
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:16,853
But to be unsure, ugh.

654
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:18,725
I don't know.

655
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:20,560
What If there's no reason In your life

656
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:22,463
to feel shltty,
but you do anyway?

657
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:23,898
No enemy to polnt at?

658
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:25,766
What do you do then?

659
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,304
I mean, I look at all
the people around me-

660
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:28,599
Gabe?

661
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:32,240
What are
you doing?

662
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,139
Working!

663
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,252
Freezing.
Hey. H uh?

664
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:24,261
Oh, it looks
great, Dad.

665
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:26,923
It's great to
see you, Gabe-O.

666
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:28,158
How are you? H uh?

667
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:29,528
Good.

668
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:30,828
Annie tells me
you're busy.

669
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:32,631
I- I mean, you know,

670
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:34,331
she tells me you're
busy, I know you're busy.

671
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,371
Dad, he's
always busy.

672
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:36,804
Gabe-O's fine.

673
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:37,842
I'm not too busy,
not too busy.

674
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:38,967
How about you?

675
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:40,136
Oh, how do I look?

676
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:41,839
Yeah, you look good.

677
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:42,936
Erik is doing the Happy
Polar Bears Tri Ath

678
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:44,038
again this year.

679
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:45,138
You are?

680
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:46,946
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

681
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:48,451
Look, it's - Look, it's no big deal.

682
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,647
You do a... you know,
a few K run,

683
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:52,815
a few K bike,
a K or two ski...

684
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:54,654
You should do it with me. It'll be fun.

685
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:55,954
It's very low-key. Why
don't you do it with us?

686
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:57,790
Oh, wow.
I don't know.

687
00:31:57,862 --> 00:31:59,159
The altitude- I forgot
about what it's like here.

688
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,630
That's a lot of
Ks and stuff.

689
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,564
That's... K, K...

690
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,726
I'm... I'm more of... I'm
not the jolly jogger kind of,

691
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:07,304
but a little air hockey
tournament, I'm your man.

692
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:11,138
Air hockey.

693
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,836
Ah, come on.
Are you sure?

694
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,378
You won't...? Annie,
what about you, honey?

695
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,571
I'm in. I'm in.

696
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,739
Yeah?
Okay.

697
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:20,409
So, Dad says you're
wrltlng a book or somethlng?

698
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:21,985
A play. Yeah.

699
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:24,078
You know, you should
do it up here.

700
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:26,851
Sidney Sheldon's got a
place up here in the summer.

701
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:28,916
Oh, wow.

702
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:30,688
What's it about?

703
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:32,423
It's, um...

704
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,363
It's like, uh, Jesus
Chrlst Superstar.

705
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,924
You know that one?

706
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,028
Only on ice.

707
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:44,700
What does that mean?

708
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:46,539
No, it's... it's,
uh... it's...

709
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:48,010
I'm just kidding.

710
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,377
It's, like, about
relationships.

711
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:52,416
U m...

712
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:55,077
It has nothing to do with
Jesus Chrlst Superstar.

713
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:56,552
H uh.

714
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:58,555
At all.

715
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:00,887
What-What kind
of relationships?

716
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,689
You know, just,
just people and-

717
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:08,728
I got to say that I
like James Bond more than-

718
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,734
All I'm asklng

719
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:13,703
Is for you to spend tlme wlth my famlly.

720
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:15,239
Why is that so hard?

721
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:16,899
You know what this
means to my dad.

722
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:18,533
All I'm saying is just,
let me just... I...

723
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,907
You know, I'll catch up with you later.

724
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:21,468
I just want
to be at my best.

725
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,240
Don't make a big
deal, Annie. Come on.

726
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,241
Why did you
come here?

727
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:28,081
What do you mean?
What? What?

728
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:29,245
Why did you come?

729
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:30,879
What favor

730
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:32,252
dld you thlnk you
were dolng me?

731
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:33,814
You're rude
to my family.

732
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:35,620
You talk to them
like they're idiots!

733
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:37,058
Oh, now, come on, I'm
not rude to your family.

734
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:38,925
Your family's fine,
all right?

735
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:40,157
I'm the same as I've always
been with your family.

736
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:41,459
They just don't get me.

737
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:42,760
Oh, my God, no.

738
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,392
Sometimes you're just...

739
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:45,936
Why? Why?
Please tell me why

740
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:46,993
does my family
not get you?

741
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:48,663
Give it a rest!

742
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:50,104
Why? Because you're so goddamn complex?

743
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:51,574
Aah! Give it
a rest, Annie!

744
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:52,667
No. Tell mel
Why? Why?

745
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:54,574
Do I get you?

746
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:56,170
Oh, do you get me?
No, you don't get me.

747
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:05,187
What the hell

748
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,348
Sorry.

749
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:07,482
Oh, that's good.

750
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:08,684
You all rlght?

751
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:09,851
Oh, God.

752
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:11,121
You feel better?

753
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:12,788
Yes, I do.

754
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,832
Thls Is great.

756
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,635

757
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:23,140
you know, and have the

758
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,108
Come on.

759
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:28,111
I know you know

760
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:31,637
how you've been pushing my buttons.

761
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:33,479
Yeah, I have.

762
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:36,019
Yeah.

763
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:40,490
I think that
I should probably-

764
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:41,889
go home.

765
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,500
Not what I thought
you were going to say.

766
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:07,482
Everything okay?

767
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:08,985
Yeah, flne.

768
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:12,580
Let's go on
the happy hike.

769
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,681
Well, let's go.
Come on.

770
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:32,537
Oh.

771
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:34,271
Look, look, I'm...

772
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:35,869
I'm tired of
waiting, Rocky.

773
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,972
No, Glenn Masters
called me directly-

774
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:39,539
not Lauren, but Glenn himself-
to request a new designer.

775
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,608
Yeah, okay.

776
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,845
Gabe left-left and didn't
deliver the designs agaln.

777
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:44,047
He just, he just left.

778
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:45,714
He's a distracted guy,

779
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,257
but when I talked to
him, his designs-

780
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:48,586
Oh, come on,
I've been through this

781
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:50,684
a thousand
times with him.

782
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,229
No. I'm over it. I'm done.
He knows this is coming.

783
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:53,855
He knows
this is coming.

784
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,194
No one ever knows
they're gonna be fired,

785
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:56,290
even if they
say they do.

786
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:57,766
He's done, over!

787
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:08,209
I wanted you to
hear it from me.

788
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:10,213
You're not pissed,
are you?

789
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:12,306
Oh, no.

790
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:18,322
No, no. I'm
not, I'm, uh...

791
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,323
I'm glad you were the one to fire me.

792
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:29,824
I guess I just feel a
bit, uh, stupid, you know?

793
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:33,165
Embarrassed.
H uh.

794
00:36:33,238 --> 00:36:36,537
I shouldn't be surprised.

795
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:38,508
M ichael thought
you'd feel that way.

796
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,339
Oh, he did?

797
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:42,913
Well, fuck him. Tell him
I was totally surprised.

798
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:53,347
What, uh... What about
Lauren's project? U h...?

799
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:55,051
Lauren's cool.

800
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,650
Look, your designs
are basically finished.

801
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:58,661
We're just dealing
with engineering now.

802
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:01,357
Don't sweat it, man.

803
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:02,592
H mm?

804
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,328
Fuck it.

805
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:10,596
Yeah.

806
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:13,601
Yeah.

807
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:15,942
U h, listen,
I'm gonna take off, okay?

808
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:17,845
I just don't-

809
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:23,581
I want to get some air and
go for a little walk and...

810
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:25,555
Gabe, Gabe,
are you okay?

811
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:28,319
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I just
want to... I just want to...

812
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:33,555
I'll see you.

813
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,502
You call me if
you need anything.

814
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:49,836
Hey, Noname.

815
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:51,848
# Noname. #

816
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,679
Gabriel?

817
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:56,948
Is he in the bathroom writing again?

818
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:59,888
I don't think so.

819
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:02,357
Gabe?

820
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:06,491
Okay.

821
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:11,433
What is it going to
be, chicken or fish?

822
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:13,299
Whatever.

823
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:14,861
No, no, come on,
you're the boss tonight.

824
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:17,464
I promised.

825
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:20,534
Mom?

826
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:23,581
How come you and Dad
are so mad at each other?

827
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:26,741
Why can't you be like when we
were in Maine for the summer?

828
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,024
We still love
each other.

829
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:37,220
It's, it's just...

830
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:39,229
J ust what?

831
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:44,234
How come the only time you
guys are together is with me?

832
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:45,462
Oh, baby, is
that true?

833
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:46,594
Yeah.

834
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:50,401
Come here.

835
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:15,064
Look In the fucklng flre.

836
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:17,260
Dare to go at the
plvotal moments.

837
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,736
Whenever you thlnk It's too
uncomfortable to look at,

838
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:23,365
look at It, wrlte It.

839
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:26,372
When Annle sald-

840
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:28,435
Why did you come?

841
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:29,673
What favor did
you think

842
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:31,009
you were dolng me?

843
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:32,742
Aah, give it
a rest, Annie!

844
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:33,749
No, tell me.
Why? Why?

845
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:34,978
Do I get you?

846
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:36,144
No, you don't get me.

847
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,951
I'm not gonna let us
do this to each other-

848
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:43,459
not a chance-
so let's dance.

849
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:57,800
Okay.

850
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:18,894
What are
you dolng?

851
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:20,657
Whoa.

852
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:23,826
Are you drunk?

853
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:26,495
Listen, I spoke
to, uh, Pamela,

854
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:28,801
and sh-she was really
impressed with the outline

855
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:31,341
an-and she said she would
continue to look at what I do,

856
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:33,639
I mean, if I really go
back and make it great.

857
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:37,010
She didn't really
exactly say that, but...

858
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:41,083
U m, what, you
mean the... the play?

859
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:42,209
Yeah, yeah.

860
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,344
Oh.

861
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:45,013
Isn't that great?

862
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:47,182
Yeah, no, tha-that's
great, I just, um...

863
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:49,488
I just, I- wha-what
does that mean?

864
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,358
Okay, Annie, I want, I want
you to take a look at it

865
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,421
and tell me
what you think.

866
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:58,833
I want you
to read it, Annie.

867
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:02,532
U m, I can't.

868
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:05,371
M m, not yet.

869
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:06,501
Why not?

870
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,070
It scares me.

871
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,349
It's a stupid
outline of a play.

872
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:19,048
It's not even a play yet.

873
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:20,283
It's just...

874
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:34,094
Okay.

875
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:38,575
But it's great.

876
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:40,440
I'm, I'm really
excited for you.

877
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:45,908
I'll see
you at home.

878
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:07,897
Okay...

879
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:12,905
Ja, ja...

880
00:42:12,977 --> 00:42:17,038
Are you ever not smoking,
Saffron Genitalia?

881
00:42:17,114 --> 00:42:18,945
It's Jenetal.

882
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:20,779
Jenitards?

883
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:22,877
Jenetal.

884
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:24,581
You know,
we don't need

885
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:26,282
your kind of trouble
here in these parts.

886
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:28,416
What kind of
trouble is that?

887
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:30,790
It's the kind of trouble
you, you can't flush

888
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:32,762
because it just
keeps floating.

889
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,593
That's very, very clever.

890
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:39,368
U h-huh, okay,
so... uh-huh.

891
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:44,206
Okay, all right, you
want to know how it works?

892
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:46,276
This is
how it works.

893
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:48,938
I haven't listened to it yet,
but every time you call me,

894
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:51,379
I'm golng to llsten to
one less song on the demo.

895
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:52,949
All rlght?

896
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:54,211
I promlse I'll
llsten to It.

897
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:55,274
Okay.

898
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:56,445
Thank you.

899
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,385
Patience is a virtue.

900
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,482
Hey.

901
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:03,959
Hl.

902
00:43:04,028 --> 00:43:05,086
What do you think?

903
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:06,151
H mm...

904
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,322
Eh... eh.

905
00:43:07,398 --> 00:43:08,524
Eh?

906
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:11,625
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

907
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:16,473
So...?

908
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,475
She liked it...

909
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:22,011
and, uh, she might
possibly even rep me.

910
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,307
She said that?

911
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:24,848
No, she didn't
say that.

912
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:26,178
She didn't say that
at all, actually.

913
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,081
I'm just, uh,
making it up.

914
00:43:28,185 --> 00:43:29,379
I'm pretending she said
that, but she did like it.

915
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:30,545
She did?

916
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:31,849
Yeah.

917
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:34,915
Fan-fucking-wonderful, man!

918
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:37,085
Sachi-he's
rubbing off on me.

919
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:39,287
Ah, ah, okay.

920
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:40,591
So this is
wonderful news.

921
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:42,529
What's with
the pouty face?

922
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,160
I- I just saw Annie and she,
she refuses to read it.

923
00:43:45,236 --> 00:43:47,602
She says that
it's scary to her.

924
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:49,969
Well, I mean,
you do talk constantly

925
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:52,669
about how the play is
about a man who is lost,

926
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:55,109
so, you know, how do
you expect her to feel?

927
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:56,840
Yeah, but, you
know, it's not-

928
00:43:56,914 --> 00:44:00,281
it's, like, symbolic of a, you know, a
- a man

929
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:02,352
not, not who
lost himself,

930
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,854
but it symbolizes a man who,
you know, is finding himself.

931
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:06,753
So what's scary
about that?

932
00:44:06,857 --> 00:44:08,688
Well, that's exactly what
she's afraid of maybe, Zoom.

933
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:11,785
I mean, what is she going to find there?

934
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:13,295
You just have
to think of it

935
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:16,298
from her side,
rather than yours.

936
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:18,028
People do that?

937
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:19,569
Every day.

938
00:44:19,637 --> 00:44:21,298
Eh, how can you be
so sure, though?

939
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:23,373
Oh, trust
me, I'm sure.

940
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:25,466
I'm even afraid of what you're
gonna do to me in the play.

941
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:26,635
Well, you should be.

942
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:30,976
You know, they're
good, by the way.

943
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:32,140
What's their name?

944
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:34,081
Placenta,

945
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:37,314
but we are talking them into
changing it to Peacepipe.

946
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:38,650
Why?

947
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:13,615
Are you okay?

948
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:15,386
M r. Richmond?

949
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:16,949
I'm pretty sure Dr.
Martin will see you now.

950
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:27,103
M r. Rlchmond,

951
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:29,662
thanks for coming.

952
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:31,298
Well, it's a
bit complicated.

953
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,468
We tried to
call your wife

954
00:45:33,544 --> 00:45:36,377
because these things are usually
best handled between us girls,

955
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,414
if you'll pardon
my saying so...

956
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,109
Is she, uh...
is-is she all set?

957
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:41,481
Does she need...?

958
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:42,712
Yeah, that's,
that's plenty.

959
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,878
Maybe I've
got a bag.

960
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:44,978
H mm.

961
00:45:47,825 --> 00:45:51,886
Your dad
seems funny.

962
00:45:51,996 --> 00:45:53,554
At least
he came.

963
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:01,904
Elizabeth.

964
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:05,407
Lizard, come on,
please, please.

965
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:07,409
Lizzy.

966
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:08,637
Hey.

967
00:46:08,712 --> 00:46:11,237
Hey, what's
going on?

968
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:12,304
Why did
you do that?

969
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:14,317
Do what?

970
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:17,354
Do what?! Bring all that
female stuff to school-

971
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:19,218
to Dr. Martin's office-

972
00:46:19,323 --> 00:46:20,813
for the whole
world to see!

973
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:22,381
I'm sorry, I was,
I was worried, Lizzy.

974
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:23,824
You're such an
asshole sometimes.

975
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:25,384
Whoa, whoa,
just a minute now.

976
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:26,929
And you can't put
this in your play.

977
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:27,929
I'm not one of your
dumb characters.

978
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:29,090
I'm a person.

979
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,190
Elizabeth-

980
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:32,064
Not that you care.

981
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:33,830
Oh, come on, all right,
listen, I know you're upset,

982
00:46:33,904 --> 00:46:35,735
but you can't speak to me
that way, all right?

983
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,831
I put my sweater around me to hide it,

984
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:44,438
and it fell off in
front of everyone.

985
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:48,679
I'm fine, Dad,
just forget it.

986
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:52,381
Hey, what's
going on, huh?

987
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,448
I don't know, I guess I'm
just PM S'ing or something,

988
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:57,254
you know, like
you and Mom.

989
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:06,459
God, It just scared
the shlt out of me.

990
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:08,528
I mean, I was hovering over my body,

991
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:11,200
watching this, uh,
asshole act like a parent

992
00:47:11,275 --> 00:47:13,038
in a scene from Llttle
House on the Pralrle-

993
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,544
you know, the special
two-hour tampon episode.

994
00:47:15,613 --> 00:47:16,637
I think I
missed that one.

995
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:19,176
That's what
it was like.

996
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,148
Hey, shh.

997
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:21,240
Llzzy?

998
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:22,751
Shh, shh, shh.

999
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,310
She's all right,
she's sleeping.

1000
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:26,252
I was out at a
meeting all day

1001
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:28,291
and I didn't get the message
until it was too late.

1002
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:30,383
Everythlng's okay. I
went down to the school.

1003
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:33,259
I heard.
Is she okay?

1004
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,561
Yeah, I mean, I think she was
embarrassed and wanted to die,

1005
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:38,226
but from what I
hear from her,

1006
00:47:38,302 --> 00:47:40,600
Zoom talked to her and
she feels fine now.

1007
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:44,163
Good. Thanks for
taking the time.

1008
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:46,402
Surprised you
could fit it in.

1009
00:47:46,477 --> 00:47:48,104
Well, uh, yeah,
I mean, I'm her father.

1010
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:49,646
Oh, really, then why
don't you act like it?

1011
00:47:49,747 --> 00:47:51,305
I mean, you're more
like her friend.

1012
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:53,007
You're everybody's
goddamn friend.

1013
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:54,675
This isn't about the
school, is it, Annie?

1014
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,412
If you want to talk
about some other shit,

1015
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:57,954
that's fine, you know,
we'll talk about it,

1016
00:47:58,022 --> 00:47:59,489
but don't insinuate
I'm a bad father.

1017
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,182
I was there with her today and...

1018
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:03,123
All right, thank you,
you're a good father.

1019
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:04,923
But it's on your time.
It's when you feel like it.

1020
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:05,984
How could you bring that
up today, of all days?

1021
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:07,427
Cari, come on.

1022
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:09,659
It's okay. You
know what? I...

1023
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,132
It's that uncomfortable
houseguest-in-the- middle-of-a-fight thing.

1024
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:12,635
I... I'm gonna get
out of here.

1025
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:14,193
I love you
both, and...

1026
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:16,102
glve my love
to Llzzy, huh?

1027
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:36,220
I'd never let anything get
in the way of Elizabeth.

1028
00:48:36,293 --> 00:48:38,454
Didn't know we were
keeping score, Annie.

1029
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:40,656
Come on-
Jesus Christ.

1030
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:37,544
I tried to call you at
Cari's, but you'd already gone.

1031
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,953
And I apologized
to her.

1032
00:49:40,024 --> 00:49:41,685
It was...

1033
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:43,693
it was rude of me.

1034
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:47,292
Yeah, I went for a
walk; I should've called.

1035
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:48,626
I'm sorry.

1036
00:49:48,732 --> 00:49:51,701
Oh, no, no.
It's all right.

1037
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:58,866
Annie, you know,
we used to...

1038
00:49:58,942 --> 00:50:04,642
just get along
so much easier.

1039
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:06,648
This isn't us.

1040
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:15,655
I'm a little confused
about what "us" is.

1041
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:18,227
What do you mean?

1042
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:21,389
Well, do we feel like a
husband and wife to you?

1043
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:31,138
We always-

1044
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:34,733
loved each other
too much to-

1045
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:40,645
even think about-
not being together.

1046
00:50:55,265 --> 00:50:59,929
If you, uh, if
you removed...

1047
00:51:00,003 --> 00:51:02,699
Lizzy from our life,
do you think you...

1048
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:04,764
Oh, but you can't.

1049
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:06,366
You can't.

1050
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,035
Lizzy's like...

1051
00:51:08,145 --> 00:51:11,273
she's the best
part of us.

1052
00:51:17,321 --> 00:51:19,221
I used to always...

1053
00:51:19,323 --> 00:51:22,224
I always thought
that with, uh...

1054
00:51:22,326 --> 00:51:25,784
with her
between us that-

1055
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:32,462
we could get past
the rest, you know?

1056
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:35,835
But I mean, that's not
fair, especially to her.

1057
00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:37,134
M m.

1058
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:51,886
What should we do?

1059
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:02,860
I just wish...

1060
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:06,460
Oh, God, I don't know.

1061
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:12,569
I love you, but...

1062
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,173
I am really...

1063
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:23,481
angry...

1064
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:24,953
inside.

1065
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:38,200
We need to get
ourselves back, Annie.

1066
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:56,819
Yeah.

1067
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,979
# There's a dream that I see #

1068
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:01,887
# I pray It can be #

1069
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:03,984
# Look cross the land #

1070
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:05,721
# Shake thls land #

1071
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:08,458
# A wlsh #

1072
00:53:08,565 --> 00:53:10,328
# Or #

1073
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,837
# A command #

1074
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:16,839
# A dream that I see #

1075
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,670
# Don't klll It, It's free #

1076
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:21,505
# You're just a man #

1077
00:53:21,612 --> 00:53:24,172
# You get what you can #

1078
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:25,839
# We #

1079
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:27,508
# All do #

1080
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:32,954
# What we can #

1081
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:34,854
# So we #

1082
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:37,155
# Can do just one more thlng #

1083
00:53:41,932 --> 00:53:43,695
# We #

1084
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,530
# Can all #

1085
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:49,868
# Be free #

1086
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,374
# Maybe not #

1087
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,444
# I n words #

1088
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:56,536
# Maybe not #

1089
00:53:56,613 --> 00:53:57,978
# Wlth a look #

1090
00:53:58,048 --> 00:54:00,380
# But wlth your mlnd #

1091
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:10,225
# Llsten to me ##

1092
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:12,955
So, I still
come home and...

1093
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,965
expect to see her
there, you know.

1094
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:17,967
Who? Annie
or Lizzy?

1095
00:54:18,035 --> 00:54:19,900
Lizzy.

1096
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:25,065
What do you miss most about
having them around the house?

1097
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:28,906
Here's the thlng.

1098
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:31,845
You can love the idea
of being alone

1099
00:54:31,915 --> 00:54:34,941
when there's someone
in the other room.

1100
00:54:35,018 --> 00:54:37,748
But when you're-you're
alone, it's different.

1101
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:39,754
It's... it's different.

1102
00:54:39,856 --> 00:54:41,483
Yeah.

1103
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:43,753
You're alone.

1104
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:46,091
But you know, it's good
for you to be alone.

1105
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:48,154
You're working
it all out.

1106
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:50,426
Drink some
good bad booze.

1107
00:54:59,776 --> 00:55:02,404
What is it with
you and bad booze?

1108
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:04,673
Does your body crave it or something?

1109
00:55:04,748 --> 00:55:06,943
I think it does.
I think there's...

1110
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:08,541
You know, it's-it's
more immediate.

1111
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:10,553
It just hits faster
than the good stuff.

1112
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:12,452
Yeah, yeah.
I n like one sip.

1113
00:55:21,598 --> 00:55:23,532
Hello?

1114
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,862
Well, you
sound like hell.

1115
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:26,027
So, how's the
play coming?

1116
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:27,263
U h...

1117
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:29,066
yeah... gee,
you know...

1118
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:30,629
Gabe, you know,

1119
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:32,641
I got to tell you,
I am so impressed

1120
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:34,472
with everything you've
sent me so far, but...

1121
00:55:34,578 --> 00:55:36,910
I really need to see
that whole play.

1122
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,448
You know, I've-I've never really
done thls klnd of thlng before,

1123
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:42,416
so I don't know if it's...
you know, it's coming together-

1124
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:44,113
I mean, I'm-I'm trying.

1125
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:46,155
But, uh, you know,
the good news Is,

1126
00:55:46,256 --> 00:55:47,814
wlth my life
falllng to shlt,

1127
00:55:47,924 --> 00:55:48,982
the play seems
to be flourlshlng.

1128
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:50,923
Well, that's good.

1129
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:52,825
I mean, not that your life
is falling to shit, but...

1130
00:55:52,929 --> 00:55:54,726
I like to hear
the word "flourlshlng. "

1131
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:57,995
Yeah. Well, you know, the
play's been my therapy,

1132
00:55:58,101 --> 00:56:01,161
uh, along wlth actual-
therapy, that Is.

1133
00:56:01,271 --> 00:56:03,171
Yeah, you know,
I'm-I'm just wrltlng,

1134
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:05,173
and at thls polnt, I
really don't even care

1135
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:07,140
If anyone sees It.

1136
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:08,768
Gabe, you know, I know you've
been going through hell,

1137
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:10,335
and, look, I mean,
we've all been there,

1138
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:12,075
and oh, blah, blah,
blah, who cares?

1139
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:14,515
And I know, I know,
I keep harping

1140
00:56:14,584 --> 00:56:17,018
on all this devotion-to-craft
stuff, but...

1141
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,520
just don't get so
Involved In your own shlt

1142
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:21,682
that you forget the favor I'm dolng you.

1143
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:24,022
I am not a therapist.
I am not a writing coach.

1144
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:26,028
I sell plays.

1145
00:56:26,129 --> 00:56:30,122
But if I'm involved, I do
care if someone sees this play.

1146
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,997
You're hyping me.

1147
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:34,536
You're, you're-you're
trying to give me a pep talk.

1148
00:56:34,638 --> 00:56:37,698
Call it what you will,
but don't fuck it up.

1149
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:40,038
Gabe...

1150
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,102
I thlnk you've got
a real shot here.

1151
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,613
I mean, what can
I tell you?

1152
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:46,273
H uman suffering's
in vogue, but...

1153
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:48,112
Look, If we play
our cards rlght,

1154
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:50,380
we can turn all this male
angst into some money.

1155
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:55,220
I know, that's not
why you're wrltlng It.

1156
00:56:55,325 --> 00:56:59,625
But it does make the journey
just a little sweeter.

1157
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:01,630
H m. Are you
the devil?

1158
00:57:01,698 --> 00:57:04,223
Oh, I hope so, honey.

1159
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:06,292
So you just keep golng, and you let

1160
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:09,805
that play have its own life,
and you have yours, all right?

1161
00:57:09,873 --> 00:57:11,067
Okay.

1162
00:57:21,351 --> 00:57:23,876
Wrltlng Ellzabeth's scenes

1163
00:57:23,987 --> 00:57:26,080
needs to be done
wlth sensltlvlty.

1164
00:57:26,189 --> 00:57:30,091
Put yourself In her
shoes, for Chrlst's sake.

1165
00:57:47,377 --> 00:57:50,107
# I am woman,
Watch me grow #

1166
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:52,613
# See me standlng

1171
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:06,695

1182
00:58:35,592 --> 00:58:37,651
Hello?

1183
00:58:41,298 --> 00:58:43,232
It-It ha... it has
been a...

1184
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,268
very long time.

1185
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:48,236
I know.

1186
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:50,205
U h, well...

1187
00:58:50,273 --> 00:58:53,208
Lizzy, uh, sort of
kind of helped me,

1188
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:58,680
uh, not be so closed-minded,
I guess, and...

1189
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:01,182
Well, yeah,
that sounds great.

1190
00:59:01,284 --> 00:59:03,684
Yeah. Especlally the part
where I get to relax.

1191
00:59:20,804 --> 00:59:22,465
Okay. Come on, Noname.

1192
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:29,438
Hello! I'm here!

1193
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:38,045
Come on, Noname.

1194
00:59:38,154 --> 00:59:39,280
Hey, I'm here!

1195
00:59:39,356 --> 00:59:40,755
Got all my stuff!

1196
00:59:40,824 --> 00:59:43,224
My typewriter,
dog's typewriter.

1197
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,633
Hey!

1198
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,066
Sorry.

1199
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:55,229
Oh, what
a surprise!

1200
00:59:55,338 --> 00:59:57,772
Oh, you took a cab all
the way from the city?

1201
00:59:57,841 --> 01:00:00,435
Yeah, sure did
- well, we stopped, got a bite to eat.

1202
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:01,534
Oh, Mamute, Lauren.

1203
01:00:01,645 --> 01:00:02,634
Hello.

1204
01:00:02,712 --> 01:00:04,771
Lauren, Mamute.

1205
01:00:04,848 --> 01:00:07,078
You are the only guy from
Manhattan who would do that.

1206
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,084
Should we invite Mamute in for a kiss?

1207
01:00:09,185 --> 01:00:10,413
Yeah, is that cool?

1208
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,748
Come on, Noname.
Come on.

1209
01:00:20,263 --> 01:00:22,424
You gonna be able
to work here?

1210
01:00:22,532 --> 01:00:25,160
Yeah, as long as
you got a good tollet.

1211
01:00:25,235 --> 01:00:27,260
Can I talk to you
about somethlng?

1212
01:00:27,337 --> 01:00:29,771
I mean, I don't want to
make a big deal out of it

1213
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,704
and be all goofy or anything,
but I was just thinking

1214
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:33,265
that, you know,
our special friendship,

1215
01:00:33,343 --> 01:00:35,208
that maybe I should...

1216
01:00:35,278 --> 01:00:36,939
or we should concentrate
more on the friendship,

1217
01:00:37,047 --> 01:00:38,776
less on the special...

1218
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:40,611
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, slow down.

1219
01:00:40,684 --> 01:00:42,777
You didn't take a taxi all the way

1220
01:00:42,852 --> 01:00:44,786
from New York
to tell me that.

1221
01:00:47,223 --> 01:00:50,784
No.

1222
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:54,455
I came here so that I
could be with you and...

1223
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:56,362
and breathe easier.

1224
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:58,628
And I am.

1225
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:00,329
It's great.

1226
01:01:00,403 --> 01:01:02,303
I told you where
I was coming from.

1227
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:04,966
So, relax.

1228
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:09,136
No worrles.

1229
01:01:09,245 --> 01:01:11,213
You want to sleep
in the guest room?

1230
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:13,977
No.

1231
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:17,679
U h...

1232
01:01:17,754 --> 01:01:19,881
Maybe I should.

1233
01:01:19,956 --> 01:01:22,083
How's that
for an answer?

1234
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:25,150
I... I think that's
a fine answer.

1235
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:34,327
A wrlter wrltes.

1236
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:36,337
A wrlter wrltes, rlght?

1237
01:01:49,786 --> 01:01:51,651

1239
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:55,315

01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,185
U h, uh,

1241
01:01:59,295 --> 01:02:01,126
Get your ass back
to the clty, klddo.

1242
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:03,358
I have a perfect producer on the hook.

1243
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:05,025
It's about to
get Interestlng.

1244
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:06,363
And Gabe,
clean yourself up.

1245
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:07,527
U h...

1246
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:12,205
Fuck me.

1247
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:17,170
Hey!

1248
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,269
H i.

1249
01:02:18,348 --> 01:02:21,784
Have a seat.

1250
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:25,387
So...

1251
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:28,048
So...

1252
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:30,388
they backed out
of the deal.

1253
01:02:30,493 --> 01:02:33,257
I'm sorry.

1254
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:35,126
So, what-what-what
does that mean?

1255
01:02:35,198 --> 01:02:36,790
We just walt
and see

1256
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:38,299
what comes in,
or what I can maneuver.

1257
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:40,233
It may take
a llttle tlme.

1258
01:02:40,336 --> 01:02:42,395
It may take
some time.

1259
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:44,564
H uh.

1260
01:02:44,674 --> 01:02:47,734
J ust so you know, that sort
of sounds deathly cancerous.

1261
01:02:47,844 --> 01:02:50,142
I mean, what the fuck
am I golng to do?

1262
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:51,805
Well, you just
keep on writing.

1263
01:02:51,881 --> 01:02:53,143
Oh, come on.

1264
01:02:53,216 --> 01:02:54,240
No, you come on I

1265
01:02:54,317 --> 01:02:55,477
I can't...

1266
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:57,349
I mean,
Jesus, Gabriel.

1267
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,411
I mean, this isn't
some kind of a fluke.

1268
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:00,819
If you're really serious about
this, you just keep at it.

1269
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:03,983
J ust be patient.
This is what I do.

1270
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,493
I'm living out of
a suitcase, Pamela.

1271
01:03:05,562 --> 01:03:07,496
Gabriel, I love you,
I really do,

1272
01:03:07,564 --> 01:03:09,429
but this fucking whining
white guy shit has gotta stop.

1273
01:03:09,532 --> 01:03:11,500
You just use thls tlme
to work on your wrltlng,

1274
01:03:11,568 --> 01:03:12,592
to prove to yourself
that you are a wrlter.

1275
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:13,760
J ust keep on going.

1276
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:14,894
J ust polish.

1277
01:03:21,711 --> 01:03:23,838
Thank you for
the flowers.

1278
01:03:25,915 --> 01:03:29,544
# Whenever you need me,
I'll be there #

1279
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:31,849
You gotta just try
shucking the corn.

1280
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:33,946
I don't get-I
don't really get it.

1281
01:03:34,023 --> 01:03:35,513
Yeah. It's clear.

1282
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:37,219
I don't think I wanna understand it.

1283
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:38,624
No, no, I... it's
just... that's too weird.

1284
01:03:38,728 --> 01:03:39,695
I think... okay,
for a woman,

1285
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:41,525
Don't knock it.

1286
01:03:41,598 --> 01:03:43,532
I think maybe yeah, because
it's nice and smooth.

1287
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,931
Like, let's say you're going,
you're going down on her,

1288
01:03:45,034 --> 01:03:45,898
and she's all wet
and slippery.

1289
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:47,027
Oh, God.

1290
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:48,593
And she-

1291
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:50,104
Oh! Mama loves Daddy,
Mama loves Daddy,

1292
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:51,798
Mama loves Daddy,
Mama loves Daddy!

1293
01:03:51,908 --> 01:03:54,468
No, I... I
honestly don't get

1294
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:57,478
the whole vagina
fascination thing of yours.

1295
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,842
I don't get it.

1296
01:03:58,915 --> 01:04:00,382
Well, uh,
you wouldn't.

1297
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,008
No, I mean, look.

1298
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:03,916
No, no. Freedom's
about choice. Yeah.

1299
01:04:03,987 --> 01:04:05,579
Okay, you turn a woman
upside down, what do you get?

1300
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:07,555
Relatively the same thing at both ends.

1301
01:04:07,624 --> 01:04:10,821
You turn a man upside down,
honey, you get a choice.

1302
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:11,916
Oh!

1303
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:12,984
Barbecue.

1304
01:04:13,096 --> 01:04:14,461
Oh!

1305
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:16,327
Yes. It's better.
I've done both.

1306
01:04:16,432 --> 01:04:17,660
I know.

1307
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:19,758
You? Wh-What
do you mean?

1308
01:04:19,836 --> 01:04:21,997
I was with a woman.

1309
01:04:22,071 --> 01:04:24,505
J unior year in college,

1310
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:26,633
there's this girl
determined to make me

1311
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:28,677
her little Mandingo
chocolate fantasy.

1312
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:30,507
H uh? And I
wasn't the one

1313
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,514
trying to be Tarzan
to her playing Jane.

1314
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:34,413
M iss thing comes
into my room-

1315
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:36,179
she's got nothing
but the robe on-

1316
01:04:36,252 --> 01:04:38,618
sits down...

1317
01:04:38,688 --> 01:04:40,212
and spreads her legs.

1318
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,588
Yeah?

1319
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:44,684
It-It looked like a boiled
egg with a split in it.

1320
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:46,251
Oh, God!
Mommy loves Daddy.

1321
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:47,887
It's ug- You've
got to admit it's-

1322
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:49,522
No, it looked like
M ick Jagger sideways.

1323
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,827
You know, like them child-bearing lips?

1324
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:52,834
Got it, I
got it, yeah.

1325
01:04:52,936 --> 01:04:54,563
Oh, honey, we're rolling
stone, go roll on home. Oh!

1326
01:04:54,637 --> 01:04:56,537
Bartender, can we get
the-the gentleman here

1327
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:58,971
the... a vodka with,
uh... with corn...

1328
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:00,942
With corn.

1329
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:02,375
And a vodka for, uh, me,
with a little... little egg.

1330
01:05:02,445 --> 01:05:04,538
Get me a... get
me a big corn.

1331
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:06,377
Or a corn.

1332
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:07,949
H i.

1333
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:12,879
You's a squirrel,
you're gonna get a nut.

1334
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:16,883
H uh?

1335
01:05:19,028 --> 01:05:22,657
I don't know, life...
life has a sense of humor.

1336
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:25,565
My dad wanted an
ultra-macho son.

1337
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:28,068
I nstead, he got me.

1338
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:30,298
Spent most of my
childhood trying to...

1339
01:05:30,373 --> 01:05:32,637
beat the fabulous
out of me.

1340
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:34,301
To no avail.

1341
01:05:34,377 --> 01:05:36,470
# Me and M rs. Jones #

1342
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:39,913
When I... when I got in
trouble, my dad used to say,

1343
01:05:40,016 --> 01:05:42,246
"J ust go ahead,
pick the punishment, "

1344
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:45,253
you know, as long as, uh,
you're creative

1345
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:47,585
and as long as he got
to approve it.

1346
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:50,649
So, you know, he would
have me read a book.

1347
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:52,524
Carl and I... as soon
as we got In trouble

1348
01:05:52,595 --> 01:05:54,563
or thought we were golng
to get In trouble,

1349
01:05:54,664 --> 01:05:56,427
we would just go and
we would get some books.

1350
01:05:56,532 --> 01:05:58,557
And we were
inseparable, even then.

1351
01:05:58,668 --> 01:06:01,068
And It was so much fun
belng on the roof wlth her,

1352
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,501
'cause when... when...

1353
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:03,596
Gabriel, Gabriel.

1354
01:06:03,706 --> 01:06:05,105
What?

1355
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:06,698
Wh-who-who are you
right now, man?

1356
01:06:06,776 --> 01:06:08,437
You're just like...
you're just like...

1357
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,445
you're turning into the
blabbering bar guy.

1358
01:06:10,546 --> 01:06:12,605
No, I'm not-

1359
01:06:12,715 --> 01:06:14,182
Do you even know that I'm
here? You're just like...

1360
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,115
bip, bip, bip, bip.

1361
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:17,618
Good Lord.

1362
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,950
You... what are you
talking about?

1363
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:21,921
You've just been talklng
about Carl all day.

1364
01:06:22,025 --> 01:06:23,515
No, I... no.
Come on.

1365
01:06:23,593 --> 01:06:25,288
No, no, It's cool.
It's great.

1366
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:27,454
You like her,
so that's good.

1367
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:30,956
You guys ever
H umpty Dumpty?

1368
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:32,796
# My favorite song #

1369
01:06:32,902 --> 01:06:35,132
Did we ever H umpty Dumpty?

1370
01:06:35,238 --> 01:06:37,001
Come on, Rock.
She's my friend. I...

1371
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:41,704
Yeah, we humped once.

1372
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:47,216
I n, uh... high school.

1373
01:06:47,283 --> 01:06:49,114
Yeah, it was...

1374
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:50,981
I don't really remember It
very well, but, uh,

1375
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:52,486
one of us puked.

1376
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:57,652
That's the split
egg thing.

1377
01:06:57,727 --> 01:06:59,752
I'm sorry. What...

1378
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:03,663
You need to just stop all
the hesitation in your life.

1379
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:05,495
Can I tell
you a story?

1380
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:08,331
Is it a... is it going
to be a... a long story?

1381
01:07:08,404 --> 01:07:09,996
Yeah.

1382
01:07:10,106 --> 01:07:12,006
Well, first, growing up black and gay...

1383
01:07:12,108 --> 01:07:13,166
had its challenges.

1384
01:07:13,276 --> 01:07:14,265
Hold on- you're gay?

1385
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:18,243
I could have also
been a dwarf, but...

1386
01:07:18,314 --> 01:07:21,681
but that wasn't the
toughest shit I dealt with.

1387
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:25,585
Toughest thing I ever
dealt with in my life

1388
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:27,680
was just
being in love.

1389
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,087
You were in love?

1390
01:07:29,158 --> 01:07:32,787
Yeah.

1391
01:07:32,862 --> 01:07:36,764
Luis, the Greek God
of Spanish Harlem-

1392
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:41,361
174 pounds of
papl chulo-

1393
01:07:41,437 --> 01:07:44,668
and-and...

1394
01:07:44,774 --> 01:07:46,765
I got up
my courage...

1395
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:53,715
You mean... you mean, you...
you said that you loved him?

1396
01:07:53,816 --> 01:07:59,379
And he didn't feel
the same way about me.

1397
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:02,549
Broke my heart.

1398
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:04,091
That's just so depressing.

1399
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,559
No. You know what?

1400
01:08:05,628 --> 01:08:07,562
I realized...

1401
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:09,564
I had a heart
to break.

1402
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:12,294
All this time, I'd
been emotionally numb,

1403
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:13,926
and now I
was feeling...

1404
01:08:14,003 --> 01:08:16,563
I wasn't feeling
what I wanted to feel,

1405
01:08:16,639 --> 01:08:18,573
but I was
alive again.

1406
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:20,232
You understand?

1407
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:23,073
And-And-And deep,
honest love like that-

1408
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:25,306
it doesn't
happen every day.

1409
01:08:25,381 --> 01:08:28,077
# It hurts so much inside #

1410
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:30,415
Are you talking
about Cari?

1411
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,647
I'm talklng
about feellngs.

1412
01:08:32,722 --> 01:08:36,488
You've been
talking about Cari.

1413
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:39,084
# Tomorrow, we'll meet
At the same place #

1414
01:08:39,162 --> 01:08:40,527
# The same time #

1415
01:08:40,596 --> 01:08:42,496
H mm?

1416
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:46,763
# Me and M rs. #

1417
01:08:46,836 --> 01:08:49,100
# M rs. Jones #

1418
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:51,606
# M rs. Jones, M rs.
Jones, M rs. Jones ##

1419
01:09:10,893 --> 01:09:16,195
Better be
Freddie Mercury.

1420
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:19,496
Zoom.

1421
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:20,866
Hey.

1422
01:09:20,937 --> 01:09:22,029
What... what
are you doing?

1423
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:23,196
It's 4: 00 a. m.

1424
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:25,805
You okay?

1425
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:27,205
Yeah.

1426
01:09:27,276 --> 01:09:29,005
Oh, yes, I am.

1427
01:09:29,078 --> 01:09:30,875
I'm drunk, a little.

1428
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:33,479
Yeah. What happened?

1429
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:37,815
Oh, but I know
what I'm doing.

1430
01:09:39,755 --> 01:09:41,655
Where did you go?

1431
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:44,916
H i.

1432
01:09:44,994 --> 01:09:46,052
Hey.

1433
01:09:46,128 --> 01:09:48,323
Come on, sit down.

1434
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:49,420
I just, uh...

1435
01:09:49,499 --> 01:09:52,061
Okay.

1436
01:09:52,134 --> 01:09:53,260
Do you want
some coffee?

1437
01:09:53,336 --> 01:09:55,304
Yes, please.
No! No.

1438
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:57,895
No, I just want... can you
just listen to me for a second?

1439
01:09:57,974 --> 01:10:00,738
'Cause I've been walking
around and thinking about us.

1440
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:02,072
You and Annie?

1441
01:10:02,144 --> 01:10:05,170
No.

1442
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:06,942
" Us"- you mean
you and me.

1443
01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:08,176
Bingo. Yeah.

1444
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:09,843
Yeah, Annie...

1445
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:14,015
and me, that would
be "them, " right?

1446
01:10:14,123 --> 01:10:15,750
Cari, it's always
been there.

1447
01:10:15,825 --> 01:10:16,849
I mean, come on.

1448
01:10:16,926 --> 01:10:18,188
U h-huh.

1449
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:19,751
See what I'm...?

1450
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:22,559
I'm going to get
us that coffee.

1451
01:10:22,632 --> 01:10:23,826
Yeah, no, no, no, Cari.

1452
01:10:23,933 --> 01:10:25,764
No, I... I
got to get...

1453
01:10:25,835 --> 01:10:27,268
I got to get this all
out at once. I love you.

1454
01:10:27,336 --> 01:10:29,201
I love you.
I'm in love with you.

1455
01:10:29,305 --> 01:10:30,772
I always have been.

1456
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,865
You're in love with me,
and it works.

1457
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:34,569
Okay?

1458
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:35,872
It works.

1459
01:10:35,945 --> 01:10:39,437
It's right.

1460
01:10:39,515 --> 01:10:41,210
You're sweet,
but you're drunk.

1461
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:42,546
No, no, no.

1462
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:43,641
It's not that.
No, no.

1463
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:44,947
Yeah, you are.

1464
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:46,010
What Is It?

1465
01:10:46,122 --> 01:10:47,248
Things okay?

1466
01:10:47,323 --> 01:10:48,483
Hey.

1467
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:50,992
Yeah, it's
just Gabe.

1468
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:52,220
Oh.

1469
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:55,958
H i, Gabe.

1470
01:10:56,032 --> 01:10:57,727
U m, why don't you
go back to bed?

1471
01:10:57,833 --> 01:10:59,460
I'll be up in just a few minutes.

1472
01:10:59,535 --> 01:11:00,661
Okay, hon.

1473
01:11:03,205 --> 01:11:05,139
Fuck. I didn't know.

1474
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:06,469
What are you doing?

1475
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:08,908
J ust let me...
excuse me.

1476
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:15,407
I'm not...
I'm not kidding.

1477
01:11:15,518 --> 01:11:18,749
Now I want
coffee, so...

1478
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:23,757
you're gonna have some,
whether you like it or not.

1479
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:26,760
I'm deadly serlous,
you know.

1480
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:29,422
You-you-you
love me, too.

1481
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:32,092
Of course, I love you.
I'm your best friend, okay?

1482
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:34,396
No, Cari.

1483
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:35,936
I'm talklng about love.

1484
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:37,062
I'm talklng
about everythlng.

1485
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:38,105
J ust-just laughing

1486
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:39,539
and... love!

1487
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:41,338
Like full-throttle,
hugs, kisses,

1488
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:44,004
crying, you know, making
love like we used to.

1489
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,479
Like that.

1490
01:11:47,016 --> 01:11:48,540
Okay, look...

1491
01:11:48,618 --> 01:11:51,451
we had sex one time, and you puked.

1492
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:53,454
That is not burning.

1493
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:55,956
That does not quallfy as romance.

1494
01:11:56,025 --> 01:11:58,619
I mean, indigestion,
maybe some bad Yukon Jack.

1495
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:00,889
But burning?
Romance? No.

1496
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:02,294
All rlght, llsten.

1497
01:12:02,398 --> 01:12:04,059
Cari, uh, listen.

1498
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:05,293
You know, we were kids.

1499
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:06,891
Right? So...

1500
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:09,301
uh... all right.

1501
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:11,863
Like my-my play.
Okay.

1502
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:13,306
I know, I...

1503
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:14,535
No, just listen,
listen, listen!

1504
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:16,100
I have been listening!

1505
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:17,440
I've heard everything
that you've said.

1506
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:18,478
Now, stop it.
You're drunk.

1507
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:19,912
All right?

1508
01:12:19,982 --> 01:12:21,677
Look, I know
you've been going

1509
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:23,309
through a terrible
time, and believe you me,

1510
01:12:23,419 --> 01:12:25,319
I feel your pain
as if it were my own,

1511
01:12:25,388 --> 01:12:27,913
but Jesus, you don't
come waltzing

1512
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,548
into somebody's house-

1513
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:31,820
at 4: 00 in the morning, I might add-

1514
01:12:31,927 --> 01:12:34,987
and... and go dictating
love all over the place.

1515
01:12:35,064 --> 01:12:36,998
Jesus, Zoom, what...

1516
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:44,495
what did you expect
anyway, really?

1517
01:12:44,607 --> 01:12:47,735
Look, we have the best
goddamn thing around,

1518
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,539
but I think now
you're confused,

1519
01:12:49,612 --> 01:12:50,704
and-and you're...

1520
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:55,012
and you're reaching.

1521
01:12:55,117 --> 01:12:56,277
No...

1522
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:04,357
You're afraid.

1523
01:13:04,427 --> 01:13:07,021
I'm not afraid anymore.

1524
01:13:07,129 --> 01:13:08,118
Is that so?

1525
01:13:08,197 --> 01:13:12,566
Yeah, it's so.

1526
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:15,035
So, I see you
have this all

1527
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:16,434
fucking figured out.

1528
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:18,200
It's my fear.

1529
01:13:18,274 --> 01:13:20,936
It's my fear that has
been just waiting here

1530
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,637
for you to come here

1531
01:13:22,712 --> 01:13:26,045
drunk in the middle of
the night to save me?

1532
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:28,379
It doesn't even faze you
how selfish this is,

1533
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:30,715
that you would come in
here gushing your love

1534
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,879
all over the place
without even thinking

1535
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:34,889
about how I feel.

1536
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,617
You have been married

1537
01:13:36,692 --> 01:13:38,626
for years and years,

1538
01:13:38,694 --> 01:13:40,685
and my role has been
to be your best friend I

1539
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:46,735
And your wife's best friend
and your daughter's best friend.

1540
01:13:48,537 --> 01:13:53,133
I exist... okay?

1541
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:58,044
I exlst.

1542
01:13:58,147 --> 01:14:00,411
And goddamn it, I will not be a new way

1543
01:14:00,483 --> 01:14:02,576
for you to
experience yourself!

1544
01:14:11,193 --> 01:14:12,660
U h, Cari...
fuck me...

1545
01:14:12,728 --> 01:14:14,161
Okay, look, I...
I want you

1546
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,925
to stay here tonight,

1547
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:17,498
because I don't want
you to go back out there.

1548
01:14:17,566 --> 01:14:20,091
But...

1549
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:22,831
I don't want
to talk to you...

1550
01:14:22,905 --> 01:14:27,274
until you realize how
fucked up this all is.

1551
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:30,701
You know, just...

1552
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:33,442
sleep it off and
sober up, and-and...

1553
01:14:33,516 --> 01:14:37,111
we'll talk
in the morning.

1554
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:39,279
You-You haven't
heard a word I said.

1555
01:14:39,355 --> 01:14:40,720
Yes, I have.

1556
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,052
I really
would like you

1557
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:45,287
to hear what
I said, okay?

1558
01:14:45,361 --> 01:14:46,794
Go on, get
some sleep.

1559
01:14:46,896 --> 01:14:48,295
We'll talk later.

1560
01:14:48,397 --> 01:14:50,092
And don't throw up
on my blanket.

1561
01:15:44,486 --> 01:15:46,181
# Lover #

1562

01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:08,419
I'm sorry, Noname.

1599
01:18:08,497 --> 01:18:09,987
M ind if I use the bed?

1600
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:17,428
Okay.

1601
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:30,009
Turned my life
inside out.

1602
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:33,350
Almost lost it
all in the park.

1603
01:18:33,422 --> 01:18:35,686
U h...

1604
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:38,158
apologized to the dog.

1605
01:18:44,967 --> 01:18:47,561
You ready to go to work?

1606
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:49,570
All right.

1607
01:18:49,638 --> 01:18:52,038
All systems go.

1608
01:19:40,522 --> 01:19:42,422
How's your
play going?

1609
01:19:42,524 --> 01:19:43,889
Great!

1610
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:45,323
Really great, I think.

1611
01:19:45,394 --> 01:19:47,453
Or it's just a...

1612
01:19:47,529 --> 01:19:49,861
a really good version
of shit; I-I don't know.

1613
01:19:49,932 --> 01:19:52,423
Am I in it?

1614
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:53,593
U h... yeah.

1615
01:19:53,702 --> 01:19:55,431
I mean, yeah, sort of.

1616
01:19:55,537 --> 01:19:57,437
I mean, you know, I mean,
the characters aren't...

1617
01:19:57,539 --> 01:19:58,972
um, they're different.

1618
01:19:59,041 --> 01:20:01,032
Nothing's real
in the play, so...

1619
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:03,271
I bet I'll be able to
tell who everyone is.

1620
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:04,845
Oh, oh, really,
you think so?

1621
01:20:04,913 --> 01:20:06,505
Look, let me
just read...

1622
01:20:06,582 --> 01:20:09,517
"All I'm asking is
for you to do... "

1623
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:12,281
Sorry. "All I'm
asking for you to do

1624
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:13,878
"is be with my family.

1625
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:16,516
"J ust go on the goddamn
happy hike, Gabe!

1626
01:20:16,592 --> 01:20:19,959
You don't have to be happy,
just get off your goddamn ass. "

1627
01:20:20,062 --> 01:20:23,623
U m, and then the character
named Gabriel says:

1628
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:27,533
" I think I'm coming down with
something, altitude sickness.

1629
01:20:28,737 --> 01:20:30,329
"Or Republican flu.

1630
01:20:31,573 --> 01:20:33,097
"J ust go without me.

1631
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,142
Maybe I'll catch up. "
What do you think?

1632
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,472
It's okay.

1633
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:37,705
Yeah, see, it's all...

1634
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:40,043
It's good.
It's good.

1635
01:20:40,115 --> 01:20:43,050
You're gonna change the
character names, though, right?

1636
01:20:43,118 --> 01:20:45,313
Yes. Well, no, it's...

1637
01:20:47,422 --> 01:20:48,480
H mm.

1638
01:20:48,557 --> 01:20:51,549
Good point.

1639
01:20:51,627 --> 01:20:56,496
Do you miss me?

1640
01:20:56,565 --> 01:20:58,533
Yeah.

1641
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,534
Of course. Always.

1642
01:21:00,602 --> 01:21:02,502
And Mom?

1643
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:05,836
Do you miss Mom?

1644
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:11,607
Sure.

1645
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,910
This Winston guy,
he seems...

1646
01:21:13,982 --> 01:21:15,210
good guy, huh?

1647
01:21:15,284 --> 01:21:16,615
Yeah. He's
really nice,

1648
01:21:16,685 --> 01:21:17,652
but he's not
there that much.

1649
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:19,118
Yeah.

1650
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:24,854
He seems good
for your mom, yeah?

1651
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,190
Hey, you know what?
I'm-I'm kind of hungry.

1652
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,730
Are you hungry? You
want to get some dinner?

1653
01:21:29,798 --> 01:21:30,856
Dad...

1654
01:21:30,966 --> 01:21:33,196
who do you see?

1655
01:21:33,302 --> 01:21:35,862
Besides your funny
toilet and Noname and me.

1656
01:21:35,938 --> 01:21:37,599
I don't know,
you know? I...

1657
01:21:37,673 --> 01:21:41,632
I like just seeing
me and you and Noname.

1658
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:43,871
Why don't you
see Cari?

1659
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:45,709
Why don't
I see Cari?

1660
01:21:45,781 --> 01:21:47,442
U hhh, yeah, well,
I don't know,

1661
01:21:47,516 --> 01:21:49,643
you might know more
about that than me.

1662
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:50,946
I don't.

1663
01:21:51,019 --> 01:21:52,543
She told me
not to worry.

1664
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:53,713
That made me worry.

1665
01:21:53,822 --> 01:21:55,449
What else
did she...?

1666
01:21:55,524 --> 01:21:57,492
No, you know what,
I don't really want to...

1667
01:21:57,559 --> 01:22:01,222
talk about this, is th...
is that okay? Yeah?

1668
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:04,891
I know I'm
just a kid...

1669
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:07,731
But I hate
seeing you alone.

1670
01:22:07,836 --> 01:22:09,326
I mean,

1671
01:22:09,404 --> 01:22:11,372
you always told me:
"Success is nothing

1672
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:13,304
without someone
to share it with. "

1673
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:14,740
Know what I mean?

1674
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:18,678
Good thing I'm
not successful.

1675
01:22:18,747 --> 01:22:20,806
Did I say that?

1676
01:22:20,882 --> 01:22:23,077
Actually, Billy Dee Williams
did in Mahogany, but you know.

1677
01:22:23,185 --> 01:22:24,743
Ah, right.

1678
01:22:24,853 --> 01:22:26,753
I'm serious.
I mean...

1679
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:29,416
being alone is okay,

1680
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:36,090
but being alone with
someone is good, too.

1681
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:38,257
And you, you, you...

1682
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,664
smarty, smart.

1683
01:22:39,735 --> 01:22:41,862
How did you get
so smart, you?

1684
01:22:41,937 --> 01:22:44,497
I guess I got
it from Mom.

1685
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:46,973
Oh, really?

1686
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:48,634
You're probably right.

1687
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:51,008
I'm joking.

1688
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:53,272
"M ultlple Sarcasms,

1689
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:55,441
a stage experience
by Gabriel Richmond"?

1690
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:56,847
You finally
finished this time?

1691
01:22:56,918 --> 01:22:58,681
Yeah, but
not totally.

1692
01:22:58,754 --> 01:23:00,619
I mean, I don't know, I
like it, I like it a lot,

1693
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:02,680
but it's...
it's kind of...

1694
01:23:02,758 --> 01:23:05,625
I don't have anyone to bounce
stuff off, just my dog, so...

1695
01:23:05,727 --> 01:23:07,092
Okay, like what
kind of stuff?

1696
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:09,026
I don't know,
like, the other day

1697
01:23:09,097 --> 01:23:10,121
I was thinking "douche bag,
" the word "douche bag. "

1698
01:23:10,232 --> 01:23:11,597
It's funny, right?

1699
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,962
Yeah, it's funny
in a kind of...

1700
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:15,161
sophomoric way, but...

1701
01:23:15,237 --> 01:23:16,966
Yeah, or "colostomy bag"
- that's funny.

1702
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:19,473
Ah, see, I like that.
See? Total collaboration.

1703
01:23:19,574 --> 01:23:21,098
I just really like
that; that's great.

1704
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:23,074
Am I in it?

1705
01:23:23,145 --> 01:23:24,874
'Cause you know if I'm in it,
I'm gonna be easy to spot.

1706
01:23:24,946 --> 01:23:26,880
Oh, you think you're gonna
be easy to spot, huh?

1707
01:23:26,948 --> 01:23:28,711
No, see, I
made you a...

1708
01:23:28,784 --> 01:23:30,149
a dwarf...

1709
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:35,485
named, uh, Rockette.

1710
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:38,321
Fine Negro enters stage left
- that's me, bitch.

1711
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:43,329
Wait, wait, wait!

1712
01:23:47,436 --> 01:23:49,996
Okay. Over here.

1713
01:23:50,105 --> 01:23:51,834
Go over there.

1714
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,339
Ah, perfect!

1715
01:23:53,442 --> 01:23:55,000
Again, again!
Come on, try it.

1716
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:57,135
What a dweeb!

1717
01:24:03,285 --> 01:24:04,752
And got It I

1718
01:24:14,496 --> 01:24:16,088
I know what
you're thinking.

1719
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:19,099
We all got Liza.

1720
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:22,034
The truth is...

1721
01:24:22,137 --> 01:24:24,697
It's not that
your timing sucks.

1722
01:24:24,806 --> 01:24:26,774
She's my best friend and she thinks

1723
01:24:26,842 --> 01:24:29,276
I'm talking about fucking
up our relationship.

1724
01:24:29,344 --> 01:24:31,039
You're just drunk.

1725
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:36,107
But pure love
is... scary.

1726
01:24:36,184 --> 01:24:38,209
We are soul mates.

1727
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,049
Very self-serving.

1728
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:44,115
You should have no other
choices, but you do...

1729
01:25:02,878 --> 01:25:04,038
Hey.

1730
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:05,078
Hey I

1731
01:25:06,348 --> 01:25:07,713
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

1732
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,579
This is definitely
the fun part.

1733
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,745
I am holding what I
hope will guarantee you

1734
01:25:12,854 --> 01:25:14,754
at least 14
minutes of fame.

1735
01:25:14,856 --> 01:25:16,756
And I got
enough copies

1736
01:25:16,858 --> 01:25:19,088
for you to send to anybody
who's ever fucked you over.

1737
01:25:21,396 --> 01:25:23,489
Oh, It's what we call
"I told you so" coples.

1738
01:25:23,565 --> 01:25:26,864
What...? Oh.

1739
01:25:26,935 --> 01:25:28,994
It's pretty
exciting, huh?

1740
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:32,335
Yeah. So, look who I ran
into on the street outside.

1741
01:25:32,407 --> 01:25:34,170
Hey.

1742
01:25:34,242 --> 01:25:36,437
I'll just let you two
alone to enjoy the moment.

1743
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:38,342
I gotta be
going, anyway.

1744
01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:40,779
Oh, Gabriel, I want to
see you back at the office.

1745
01:25:40,882 --> 01:25:43,112
The producers want to take
us out to dlnner tonlght,

1746
01:25:43,185 --> 01:25:44,516
which is a
very good sign.

1747
01:25:44,586 --> 01:25:46,451
When a play opens,

1748
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:47,920
they either send you flowers
with a condescending note,

1749
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:49,422
or they take you out
to dinner.

1750
01:25:49,524 --> 01:25:51,458
Dlnner means
you're a hlt.

1751
01:25:51,526 --> 01:25:52,993
Dinner's good.

1752
01:25:57,265 --> 01:26:00,132
All right, well, see you later.

1753
01:26:00,235 --> 01:26:01,793
Hey, Noname,
guess who's here?

1754
01:26:03,104 --> 01:26:04,537
Look who's
here, yeah.

1755
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,633
Ohhh. So you

You-You saw it?

1760
01:26:16,918 --> 01:26:20,911
The play's
really good.

1761
01:26:20,989 --> 01:26:22,889
Some of it
hurt, but...

1762
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,983
Of course, I was there.

1763
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,995
No, actually, I knew you
were there. Lizzy told me.

1764
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:29,928
Hey, dld you want some,
uh, tea, or somethlng?

1765
01:26:29,998 --> 01:26:31,090

01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:32,656

1767
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:34,564

at the gallery.

1768
01:26:34,636 --> 01:26:36,934
Oh, okay.
How's Winston?

1769
01:26:37,005 --> 01:26:38,836
Good.

1770
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:42,171
You saw it.

1771
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:43,710
You liked it?

1772
01:26:43,778 --> 01:26:44,802
I did.

1773
01:26:46,348 --> 01:26:48,009
You did it. I mean, you did it.

1774
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,517
Yeah, yeah,
I did it.

1775
01:26:50,585 --> 01:26:51,984
Yeah.

1776
01:26:52,087 --> 01:26:55,818
Only at the expense
of everything.

1777
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:58,017
You look good.

1778
01:26:58,093 --> 01:27:00,084
Happy.

1779
01:27:00,161 --> 01:27:02,789
You seem happy.

1780
01:27:02,864 --> 01:27:07,096
Yeah, I am.

1781
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:09,193
And proud, too,
I guess, that I...

1782
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:11,705
you know, that
I did this.

1783
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:13,638
Well, you should be.

1784
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:16,040
Wanna get married?

1785
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:19,880
Oh.

1786
01:27:19,981 --> 01:27:21,710
Yeah.

1787
01:27:27,155 --> 01:27:29,715
Oh, I thought I'd see
Cari at the theater,

1788
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,884
and then Llzzy sald
that there was-

1789
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,121
I don't know-what,
a misunderstanding?

1790
01:27:34,195 --> 01:27:36,891
I mean, I haven't seen
her for a while myself.

1791
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:39,126
A misunder... Well,
I guess I misunderstood

1792
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,134
the mlsunderstandlng. No.

1793
01:27:41,202 --> 01:27:46,469
Well, whatever it is,
I'm sorry.

1794
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:48,805
So, uh, you were in
the neighborhood?

1795
01:27:48,877 --> 01:27:52,005
Well, I drop Lizzy off,
you pick her up, and

1796
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,911
I've wanted to call
for a while,

1797
01:27:53,982 --> 01:27:56,507
and I just...

1798
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,979
wanted to tell you
how happy I am for you.

1799
01:28:01,056 --> 01:28:02,648
Thank you.

1800
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,264
Annie, listen,

1801
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:17,236
I realize that...

1802
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:20,103
all along I really should
have been just so much more...

1803
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:22,039
U m, no, no, don't.

1804
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:27,341
I know.

1805
01:28:37,759 --> 01:28:39,624
Oh.

1806
01:28:39,694 --> 01:28:41,958
You, take
care of hlm.

1807
01:28:50,538 --> 01:28:52,904
Not a word.

1808
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:05,147
If you could
wrlte It over...

1809
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:06,653
Oh, boy.

1810
01:29:06,755 --> 01:29:08,985
would you be
less selflsh?

1811
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:11,150
More brave?

1812
01:29:12,927 --> 01:29:15,088
Or would you
do It the same?

1813
01:29:15,163 --> 01:29:17,097
Gabrlel-

1814
01:29:17,165 --> 01:29:20,726
walks over to Mari,

1815
01:29:20,802 --> 01:29:23,066
cutting her off before
she can say anything.

1816
01:29:23,138 --> 01:29:24,662
I know what
you're thinking.

1817
01:29:24,773 --> 01:29:26,570
"Where was he ten years ago?" Right?

1818
01:29:26,641 --> 01:29:28,632
Wrong.

1819
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:30,836
Think about what Ann and
I got out of the marriage.

1820
01:29:30,912 --> 01:29:32,174
We all got Liza.

1821
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,010
She's such a
beautiful girl.

1822
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:38,348
And you loved Ann
as much as I did.

1823
01:29:38,453 --> 01:29:42,412
I think that we all got
most of our immature bugs out

1824
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:45,857
over the last ten years.

1825
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,020
We weren't hiding
from the truth.

1826
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:53,693
We were waiting for
the truth to find us.

1827
01:29:57,706 --> 01:29:59,037
Sorry.

1828
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:01,598
Are you serious?

1829
01:30:01,676 --> 01:30:04,440
Is this really the schmaltz
you're gonna throw at me?

1830
01:30:04,512 --> 01:30:06,207
It's pretty
corny, huh?

1831
01:30:12,654 --> 01:30:15,384
We weren't hiding
from the truth.

1832
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:19,119
It's just that the
lie got bigger.

1833
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:27,460
Hey, guys.
How's it going?

1834
01:30:30,038 --> 01:30:33,906
Yeah, this
is a bitch.

1835
01:30:34,008 --> 01:30:40,971
Why don't you
let me try?

1836
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,654
I love you,
and I'm sure of it.

1837
01:30:47,722 --> 01:30:49,917
I'm sure of
it forever.

1838
01:30:50,024 --> 01:30:51,924
When I wake up
hung over tomorrow,

1839
01:30:52,026 --> 01:30:53,493
I'll be sure of it.

1840
01:30:53,561 --> 01:30:55,085
And I'll tell you
the same tomorrow,

1841
01:30:55,196 --> 01:30:56,595
tell you the
same next week,

1842
01:30:56,664 --> 01:30:58,757
I'll tell you
the same next year.

1843
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:01,996
I love you forever,
and I am sure of it.

1844
01:31:07,075 --> 01:31:08,269
I love you forever,

1845
01:31:08,376 --> 01:31:10,037
and I am sure of It.

1846
01:31:12,013 --> 01:31:15,449
I love you... forever.

1847
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,279
And I'm sure of It.

1848
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:23,019
This is working?

1849
01:31:26,227 --> 01:31:28,354
I'm feellng slck

1850
01:31:28,429 --> 01:31:30,294
from all that
fake stage booze.

1851
01:31:30,398 --> 01:31:32,366
Why don't you
flll In for me

1852
01:31:32,433 --> 01:31:33,798
for the sex scene?

1853
01:31:33,902 --> 01:31:35,802
All right.

1854
01:31:35,904 --> 01:31:38,202
I thlnk I'm In love
wlth both of you.

1855
01:31:38,273 --> 01:31:39,467
Can we have
a three-way?

1856
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:45,136
I guess that's It.

1857
01:31:45,246 --> 01:31:46,611
Happy ever after.

1858
01:31:46,714 --> 01:31:48,739
So thls Is
how It works.
