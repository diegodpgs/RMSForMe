1
00:01:04,427 --> 00:01:08,420
Inside a snowflake,
like the one on your sleeve...

2
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,692
...there happened a story
you must see to believe.

3
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,962
Way up in the mountains,
in the high range of Pontoos...

4
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:38,840
...lay the small town of Whoville:

5
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,717
The home of the Whos.

6
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,391
Ask any Who, and they'll have this to say:

7
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:52,854
''There is no place like Whoville
around Christmas Day.''

8
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:56,190
Every window was flocked,
every lamppost was dressed...

9
00:01:56,357 --> 00:02:00,653
...and the Whoville band marched
in their Christmasy best.

10
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,620
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

11
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:24,469
Arbor Day was fine,
and Easter was pleasant...

12
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:27,805
...and every Saint Fizzin's day,
they ate a Fizz pheasant.

13
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:31,976
But every Who knew,
from their twelve toes to their snout...

14
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,439
...they loved Christmas the most,
without a single Who doubt.

15
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,154
-Farfingle's welcomes you!
-Thank you.

16
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:46,783
Merry Christmas!
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's!

17
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:49,911
We got a snoozlephone
for your brother Drew...

18
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:54,874
...and a snoozlephone for your brother Stu,
a muncle for your uncle...

19
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:58,836
...a fant for your aunt
and a fandpa for your cousin Leon.

20
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,172
So, we just need.... Cindy?

21
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:02,799
Sale on Aisle 3!

22
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,759
-Cindy Lou!
-Merry Christmas.

23
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:07,470
Hello, Myrna. Merry Christmas, Fred.
Excuse me.

24
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,097
Cindy Lou? Honey?

25
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,349
-Dad?
-Yeah?

26
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,393
Doesn't this seem like a bit much?

27
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:15,895
This is what Christmas is all about!

28
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,772
Can't you feel it?

29
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:19,023
Merry Christmas!

30
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:21,401
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's.
Wait a second!

31
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:22,735
Your change!

32
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:24,821
Another minute closer to Christmas!

33
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:30,869
And, for the next five minutes only,
99 percent off!

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,720
Yes, every Who down in Whoville
liked Christmas a lot...

35
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:52,807
...but the Grinch,
who lived just north of Whoville...

36
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,143
...did not.

37
00:03:57,896 --> 00:04:00,690
Get on it, girls.
All the good mistletoe's at the top.

38
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:04,152
-Hey, Drew, I'll race you!
-Not if I race you first.

39
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:07,572
Last one to the top is a stinky old Grinch!

40
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:13,328
You guys, where are we?
l think we should go back.

41
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:15,872
What? You're scared of the Grinch!

42
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:17,665
No!

43
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:20,543
They say he lives up here in a big cave.

44
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:23,379
And only comes down
when he's hungry for the taste of...

45
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,590
-...Who flesh!
-Drew!

46
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,220
You're scared of the Grinch!
You're scared of the Grinch!

47
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:33,514
-Are too!
-Am not!

48
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:38,311
Wait for me!

49
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,783
Go on, touch it. Touch the door.

50
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:53,576
Do it for me, Stu.

51
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:27,694
Well done, Max!

52
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,364
Serves them right, those Yuletide-loving...

53
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:34,826
...sickly-sweet,
nog-sucking cheer mongers!

54
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,454
l really don't like them.

55
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,499
No, l don't.

56
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:45,253
Max!

57
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:49,424
Get my cloak!

58
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:53,595
l've been much too tolerant
of these Whovenile delinquents...

59
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:56,723
...and their innocent, victimless pranks.

60
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:00,518
So, they want to get to know me, do they?

61
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,439
They want to spend a little quality time
with the Grinch.

62
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:08,276
l guess l could use a little...

63
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,111
...social interaction.

64
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:21,122
Merry Christmas!

65
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,832
Yeah, you bet.

66
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,709
Ho, ho, ho, and stuff.

67
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,880
Oh, my.

68
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,799
Someone has vandalized that vehicle.

69
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:34,761
You see, Max?
The city is a dangerous place.

70
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:37,722
The Grinch hated Christmas.
The whole Christmas season.

71
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:38,973
Top of the day. Flatfoot.

72
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:42,560
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

73
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:44,020
Here's a present for you.

74
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,357
Be sure to run real fast with it.
Come on. Double time. Move.

75
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,401
It could be that his head
wasn’t screwed on just right.

76
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:53,905
Or it could be, perhaps,
that his shoes were too tight.

77
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:56,658
But I think that
the most likely reason of all...

78
00:06:56,824 --> 00:07:00,745
...may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.

79
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:04,582
Stranger, won't let you go
till you buy a chapeau!

80
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,638
Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right?

81
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:20,557
l guess.

82
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:22,934
You guess?

83
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:28,231
lt's just, l look around at you and Mom
and everyone getting all kerbobbled.

84
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,109
Doesn't this seem superfluous?

85
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:32,235
Dad!

86
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:34,529
Dad!

87
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:39,909
-What happened to you?
-lt was the Grinch!

88
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,834
-Grinch?
-What do you want? l mean....

89
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,586
''Grinch? Oh, no!''

90
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,798
Did someone just say, ''Grinch''?

91
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:56,593
Hello, Mayor May-Who, sir.

92
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:00,847
Lou.

93
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:07,520
l don't need to remind you
that this Christmas...

94
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:10,773
...marks the one thousandth Whobilation.

95
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,067
Whoville's most important celebration!

96
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,946
And The Book of Who says, very clearly:

97
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:20,700
''Every size of Who we can measure...

98
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:24,746
''...knows that Whobilation
is a time we must treasure.''

99
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,790
Now, Lou, please tell me that your boys...

100
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,168
...were not up on Mount Crumpit...

101
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:34,130
...provoking the one creature
within a billion bilometers of here...

102
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:35,506
...who hates Christmas!

103
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:37,467
But it was the Grinch!

104
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:41,596
No, sir, the boys didn't see any Grinch.

105
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,848
lt was, and he came after--

106
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,100
l think they were up on the mountain...

107
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:49,437
...playing with matches,
or defacing public property, or....

108
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,232
That's a relief.

109
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,400
All right, you heard the man:

110
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,528
There is no Grinch problem here.

111
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,998
-l need it there by tomorrow.
-Heck of a rush.

112
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,626
Merry Christmas, Mo. Heck of a rush.

113
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:15,672
But, Dad...

114
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:17,632
...l just don't understand something.

115
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,510
Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch?

116
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,137
You kids and the Grinch!

117
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:27,934
You see, Cindy,
the Grinch is a Who, who always....

118
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,271
Actually, not a Who. He's more of a....

119
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:35,066
-A what?
-Exactly, honey.

120
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:38,194
And he's a What
who doesn't like Christmas.

121
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:41,030
Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie.

122
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:43,950
Not a single Christmas card, in or out.

123
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,618
Ever!

124
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:46,786
But why?

125
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,413
Lou, where's my mail?

126
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,832
Lou! Got the wrong mail here.

127
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,167
Lou! l got the wrong mail!

128
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:58,047
-l'll be right there.
-Lou, we got a problem!

129
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:00,800
All right, we'll straighten this out.

130
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:06,890
lt'll take them years to sort this out.

131
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:11,311
This is his and now it's yours,
and this hers and now it's his!

132
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,731
And for the rest of you:

133
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,735
Jury duty! Jury duty! Jury duty!

134
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:21,654
Blackmail. Pink slip.
Chain letter. Eviction notice.

135
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,907
Jury duty!

136
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:32,624
Would you mind helping me
take this to the back room, honey?

137
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,127
-Be careful of the sorting machine, right?
-Yeah.

138
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,374
Gesundheit.

139
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:24,592
You're the....

140
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:26,553
The....

141
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:27,887
The Grinch!

142
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:33,434
That worked out nicely.

143
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,353
Help!

144
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,613
Help me! Somebody!

145
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,365
Max, let's go.

146
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:49,993
Our work here is finished.

147
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:51,369
Help me!

148
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,122
Please help!

149
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,416
That is not a chew toy!

150
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,042
Stop it, Max!

151
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:01,337
Get that out of your mouth!
You have no idea where it's been!

152
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:07,385
Help!

153
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:13,850
Bleeding hearts of the world, unite!

154
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:24,027
There! Give me that!

155
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:27,447
Don't you know you shouldn't
take things that don't belong to you?

156
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,490
What's your problem?
Are you a wild animal?

157
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,578
Let's go.

158
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,997
Thanks for saving me.

159
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,922
Saving you?

160
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,008
ls that what you think l was doing?

161
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:51,554
Wrong-o.

162
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:58,019
l merely noticed that you were
improperly packaged, my dear.

163
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,065
Hold still!

164
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,025
Max, pick out a bow.

165
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,778
Can l use your finger for a second?

166
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,280
Hello! Hello!

167
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,620
-Cindy?
-Dad!

168
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:18,623
Daddy!

169
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,416
Daddy!

170
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:22,418
What the hey...?

171
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:24,712
Honey.

172
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,923
Cindy?

173
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:28,675
Dad! lt was amazing!

174
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:32,053
You've been practicing
your Christmas wrapping!

175
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:33,763
l am so proud of you.

176
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,142
Now, that's holiday.

177
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,771
Sweetlittle Cindy didn't know what to do.

178
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:44,816
In her head, bum-tumbled a conflict or two.

179
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,528
''If the Grinch was so bad,
then why did he save me?

180
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,238
''Maybe he wasn’t so bad.''

181
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,116
Maybe. Just maybe.

182
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:00,832
No lights on in the house.
Your mom must be shopping.

183
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:03,126
Good, l'm so glad you're home.

184
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,212
l can feel it, Lou. This is the year.

185
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:11,885
When everybody asks who has the most
spectacular lights in greater Whoville...

186
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:15,930
...they're gonna cry out,
''Mrs. Betty Lou Who!''

187
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:18,892
lsn't this the chandelier
from the dining room?

188
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,227
lt's all for the cause, dear.

189
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:24,856
And Cindy?
Could you be Mommy's little helper...

190
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:27,483
...and unscrew the bulb there
from the refrigerator?

191
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:30,111
-'Cause somehow l missed that one.
-Go on!

192
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:40,079
Every year Martha May Whovier
has the best lights.

193
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,707
Not this year.

194
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,375
This year...

195
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,046
...l'm gonna beat
that prim, perfect little prissy--

196
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,339
Betty!

197
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,301
-Hi!
-Martha!

198
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:57,555
My, l've never seen so many
beautiful Christmas lights, Betty Lou!

199
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:01,351
l'd blow every fuse
if l tried to keep up with you, Martha May!

200
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,187
lsn't this antique darling?

201
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:08,274
lt's handcrafted and almost 100 years old.

202
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,860
Jeez. l'm really impressed!

203
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,030
This, however, is new.

204
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:28,711
Betty! Sweetie!

205
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,312
Good night, Betty.

206
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:53,486
-l got it!
-Honey, l've got it.

207
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,654
Hello?

208
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,825
ls my sub-zero chillibrator running?

209
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:02,328
-l suppose.
-You better go catch it!

210
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,131
That's a good one! That is rich.

211
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,636
Let's go home.

212
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:25,810
Fleas before beauty. Thank you.

213
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,275
Come on, hurry up, Slowpoke.

214
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:49,542
There's got to be a better way!

215
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:14,067
A car would have paid for itself by now!

216
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,112
Goody. Another load coming down.

217
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:24,744
What's that stench?

218
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:26,996
lt's fantastic!

219
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,167
Max! Grab a bag.

220
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,087
We'll come back for the rest.

221
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:37,215
Of course, when l say ''we,'' l mean ''you.''

222
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:41,177
lt's amazing
what these Whos just throw away.

223
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:42,345
Oh, well.

224
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,517
One man's toxic sludge
is another man's potpourri.

225
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:50,186
l don't know. lt's some kind of soap.

226
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:06,327
''Where are you, Christmas?

227
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:10,331
''Why can't l find you?

228
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:15,879
''Why have you gone away?

229
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,760
''My world is changing

230
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:26,723
''l'm rearranging

231
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,642
''Does that mean Christmas

232
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:33,730
''changes too?

233
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,409
''Where are you, Christmas?

234
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,787
''Do you remember

235
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:55,919
''The girl you used to know?

236
00:18:57,295 --> 00:19:02,258
''You and l were so carefree

237
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,762
''Now nothing's easy

238
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:09,515
''Did Christmas change

239
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:15,146
''Or just

240
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:20,401
''me?''

241
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:48,930
Sweet!

242
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:01,276
''Be it ever so

243
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:02,735
''Heinous

244
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,864
''There's no place like home''

245
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,122
First floor, factory rejects.

246
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:17,792
Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max!

247
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:21,170
But we did our worst.
And that's all that matters.

248
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:25,049
At least l scared the bejeebles
out of that little girl at the post office.

249
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:27,594
She'll be scarred for life, if we're lucky.

250
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,237
Funny she didn't rat on us, though.

251
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,573
Must be afraid of reprisals.

252
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,794
Yes!

253
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,380
Down a size and a half!

254
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:08,509
And this time, l'll keep it off.

255
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:13,306
Get the stick, Max. Get the stick!

256
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,062
There's no stick!

257
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:20,647
l'm smarter.

258
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:29,113
Any calls?

259
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:32,700
You have no messages.

260
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,663
Odd. Better check the outgoing.

261
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:40,416
If you utter so much as one syllable...

262
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:44,379
...I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish!

263
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,465
If you’d like to fax me, press the star key.

264
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,344
Oh, well.

265
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,560
That's more like it.

266
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:20,540
Excellent year.

267
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,209
l'll tell you, Max...

268
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:25,795
...l don't know why l ever leave this place.

269
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,757
l've got all the company l need right here.

270
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,802
Hello!

271
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,387
Hello!

272
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:36,556
How are you?

273
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:37,932
How are you?

274
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,976
l asked you first.

275
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,311
I asked you first.

276
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:45,815
That's really mature,
saying exactly what l say!

277
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,527
Mature...exactly...what I say....

278
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:52,155
l'm an idiot!

279
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,616
You're an idiot!

280
00:22:57,869 --> 00:22:59,037
All right, fine.

281
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:02,665
l'm not talking to you anymore.
ln fact, l'm going to whisper.

282
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:07,128
So that by the time my voice reverberates
off the walls and gets back to me...

283
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:10,173
...l won't be able to hear it!

284
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:13,593
You're an idiot!

285
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,815
Am l just eating because l'm bored?

286
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:39,452
Who could that be?

287
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:44,499
Hello, little girl.
Are you here to read to us?

288
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:45,708
No.

289
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:49,212
l hear you know some things
about the Grinch.

290
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:53,091
Cindy Lou had some questions
in her curious heart.

291
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:57,262
Why did the Grinch hate Christmas?
Where did it all start?

292
00:23:57,595 --> 00:24:00,348
With her dad's blabbacorder
she wouldn't give an inch.

293
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:05,019
ln your own words, please tell me
everything you know about the Grinch.

294
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:06,980
Where did he come from?

295
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:11,359
He came the way all Who babies come.

296
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:14,821
On calm nights...

297
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:18,866
...baby Who girls
and tiny Who fellas...

298
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:24,080
...drift from the sky
in their own pumbersellas.

299
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:34,924
Hey, honey, our baby is here!

300
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:38,970
He looks just like your boss.

301
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:43,141
So that's how it works.

302
00:24:44,392 --> 00:24:48,771
lt was Christmas Eve,
and a strange wind blew that night.

303
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,343
We were having
our annual holiday get-together.

304
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:45,870
It was morning before anybody realized
that he was out there!

305
00:25:45,954 --> 00:25:47,038
The poor dear!

306
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:49,082
But, you know what?

307
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:51,209
We knew right away that he was special.

308
00:25:57,173 --> 00:25:59,300
Do you want a Christmas cookie?

309
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,262
Yes, which Christmas cookie
would you like?

310
00:26:02,387 --> 00:26:03,388
Santa.

311
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:06,349
His first words!

312
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,726
Yes, that is a Santa plate.

313
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,479
Do you want to hold this Santa plate?

314
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:20,655
Santa, bye-bye!

315
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,537
He was a wonderful...

316
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:29,664
...whatever he was.

317
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:33,543
And we raised him
like any other Who child:

318
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:35,628
With a deep love of Christmas.

319
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:42,343
Don't forget, tomorrow
is our big Christmas gift exchange.

320
00:26:42,844 --> 00:26:46,848
Everyone bring a special gift
for a special someone.

321
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:48,933
The...

322
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:50,643
...Grinch....

323
00:26:51,686 --> 00:26:54,480
He had no sense of color coordination.

324
00:26:55,356 --> 00:26:58,943
Although l hardly remember him.
l didn't have time to socialize.

325
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:01,696
I was far too busy with my...

326
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:03,489
...studies.

327
00:27:03,698 --> 00:27:06,701
Now, class, is everyone almost finished?

328
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:10,830
And if the truth be told, he....

329
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:12,248
He liked Martha.

330
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,044
Martha was my girlfriend.

331
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:23,092
l don't like discussing this Grinch
so very close to Christmas, but...

332
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:26,054
...maybe if you hear the truth,
you'll understand why--

333
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:27,931
Put your back into it!

334
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:31,601
l tried to take him under my wing.

335
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:36,272
You don't have a chance with her.
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

336
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,445
He had hair. Not pleasant.

337
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:45,698
He shed.

338
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,033
Not right.

339
00:27:49,577 --> 00:27:52,914
You know, Christmas
is my favorite time of year.

340
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:55,250
l just love the colors.

341
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,168
The red...

342
00:27:57,502 --> 00:27:59,212
...and the green.

343
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,926
Did I have a crush on the Grinch?

344
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,220
Of course not.

345
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,138
l didn't ask you that.

346
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:12,809
Right.

347
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:16,563
For some reason,
when he came home that day...

348
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:19,857
...he really got into the Christmas spirit
for the first time.

349
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,901
Perfect!

350
00:28:25,446 --> 00:28:26,531
Whoopsie!

351
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,540
What a lovely family heirloom!

352
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,512
The fires of love!

353
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:54,601
This will be perfect on the top of her tree.

354
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:57,604
Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas!

355
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:07,280
I want you all to look your best tomorrow.

356
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:10,158
You don't have a chance with her.

357
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:13,077
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

358
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,511
Has everyone given their gifts?

359
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:33,431
-l haven't.
-What?

360
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,732
Merry Christmas, Martha May.

361
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:46,486
Why do you have a bag on your head?

362
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:51,074
Probably because
he's embarrassed by that hideodorous gift.

363
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:54,202
Mr. Grinch...

364
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:56,913
...please take the bag off.

365
00:29:58,373 --> 00:29:59,457
Yes, you.

366
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:00,750
Take it off.

367
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:07,590
Put the book down.

368
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:13,638
And your foot.

369
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:18,268
Look at that hack job!

370
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:31,739
Stupid present!

371
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:33,950
Stupid tree!

372
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:37,203
l hate Christmas!

373
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:39,581
-The anger.
-The fury!

374
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:41,791
The muscles!

375
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:58,057
lt was a horrible day
when they were so cruel to him.

376
00:30:58,641 --> 00:30:59,809
And...

377
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:03,062
...l could hardly bear it.

378
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:22,248
l hate Christmas! l hate it!

379
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:26,211
And that was the last time
we ever saw him.

380
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:31,174
The very last time.

381
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,187
So, whatever the reason,
his heart or his shoes...

382
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:28,731
...he stood outside his cave...

383
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,192
...hating the Whos.

384
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:33,528
Alphabetically.

385
00:32:35,697 --> 00:32:38,074
Aardvarkian Abakenezer Who...

386
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:39,450
...l...

387
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:43,162
...hate you!

388
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:49,961
Aaron B. Benson Who, l hate you.

389
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,547
Hate, hate, hate.
Hate, hate, hate.

390
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,090
Double hate.

391
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:58,136
Loathe entirely!

392
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:06,811
Nutcrackers?

393
00:33:07,604 --> 00:33:10,481
lt's their Whobilation.

394
00:33:10,565 --> 00:33:13,109
He snarled with a sneer.

395
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:17,697
Tomorrow is Christmas!
lt's practically here.

396
00:33:19,157 --> 00:33:20,491
Max!

397
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:23,536
Fetch me my sedative.

398
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:27,790
Now to take care of those pesky memories.

399
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:33,254
''Whobilation, plentiful
with candy canes and pies

400
00:33:33,338 --> 00:33:36,424
''l can't wait to get there
to eat some google fries

401
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:38,134
''Whobilation, Whobilation''

402
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,552
-Dad?
-Yeah.

403
00:33:39,636 --> 00:33:43,723
l've been thinking about the Whobilation
and l may do something drastic.

404
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:45,934
That's fine, dear. Ask your mother.

405
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:48,561
-Where did she go?
-Honey!

406
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:50,271
Honey! Hi!

407
00:33:51,356 --> 00:33:55,193
Look, l just found the cutest light
for my Christmas display.

408
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,780
Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Come on.

409
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:20,009
And now, the nominations...

410
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:22,845
...for that Who among us
who best typifies...

411
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:26,432
...the qualities of Whodom and Whodery...

412
00:34:26,558 --> 00:34:30,812
...the Whoville holiday cheermeister!

413
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:42,031
Do l hear a nomination?

414
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:43,449
l nominate the Grinch!

415
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:48,413
-The Grinch?
-The Grinch?

416
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:52,542
My, my, my.

417
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,962
What an altruistic daughter
you have there, Lou!

418
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:58,673
Thank you.

419
00:35:00,174 --> 00:35:01,426
Cindy?

420
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:06,514
Let me quote a verse...

421
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:09,100
...from The Book of Who.

422
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:10,935
Thank you.

423
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:16,399
''The term 'Grinchy' shall apply
when Christmas spirit is in short supply.''

424
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:19,819
Now, l ask you: Does that sound
like our holiday cheermeister?

425
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:24,699
True, Mr. May-Who.
But The Book of Who says this too:

426
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:27,327
''No matter how different
a Who may appear...

427
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,330
''...he will always be welcomed
with holiday cheer.''

428
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,628
Yes, the book also says, the....

429
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:38,087
''The award...

430
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:41,007
''...cannot go to the Grinch, because...

431
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:44,928
''...sometimes things
get the lead-pipe cinch.''

432
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:47,430
You made that up! lt doesn't say that.

433
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:49,724
No, it does.

434
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:52,060
What page?

435
00:35:55,396 --> 00:35:58,399
Lost my place, but it's....

436
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:00,109
lt's in here!

437
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:02,153
But the book does say:

438
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:05,990
''The cheermeister is the one
who deserves a back slap or a toast.

439
00:36:06,324 --> 00:36:09,577
''And it goes to the soul at Christmas
who needs it most.''

440
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:12,288
And l believe that soul is the Grinch.

441
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:17,752
And if you're the Whos l hope you are,
you will too.

442
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:20,463
She's right!

443
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:26,803
Fine.

444
00:36:27,178 --> 00:36:30,598
You people want to waste
a perfectly good nomination...

445
00:36:30,723 --> 00:36:32,433
...why, it's up to you.

446
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,270
But l am telling you...

447
00:36:35,353 --> 00:36:38,690
...the Grinch will never come down.

448
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:41,734
And when he doesn't,
the Mayor will wear the crown.

449
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:43,903
Well, more or less.

high above the Who town.

A trip or a slip
you'd slide all the way down.

467
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:56,684
But this girl had a mission.
She knew what to do.

468
00:37:56,768 --> 00:38:01,147
She'd invite the Grinch herself,
that brave Cindy Lou.

Howdy?

471
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:31,719
Mr. Grinch?

472

Mr. Grinch!

Hello?

474
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:10,258
Excuse me.

475
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,650
Hello...

476
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:29,611
...little girl.

477
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:32,655
How dare you enter...

478
00:39:32,947 --> 00:39:35,408
...the Grinch's lair?

479
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:38,494
The impudence! The audacity!

480
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:41,456
The unmitigated gall!

481
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:43,583
You called down the thunder...

482
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:47,128
...now, get ready for the boom!

483
00:39:48,004 --> 00:39:51,925
Gaze into the face of fear!

484

Mr. Grinch...

485
00:39:56,721 --> 00:39:58,681
...my name is Cindy Lou Who.

486

You see?

487
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:04,187
Even now the terror
is welling up inside you.

488

l'm not scared.

489
00:40:07,232 --> 00:40:11,361
Denial is to be expected
in the face of pure evil.

490
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:15,114
l don't think so.

491
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:17,408
Doubt?

492
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:21,329
Another unmistakable sign
of the heebie-jeebies!

493
00:40:22,038 --> 00:40:25,542
Now you're doomed!

494
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:35,134
Run for your life...

495
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:38,638
...before l kill again!

496
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,684
l'm a psycho!

497
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:48,064
Danger! Danger!

498
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:59,409
Maybe you need a time-out.

499
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,291
Kids today.

500
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:09,335
So desensitized by movies and television.

501
00:41:10,128 --> 00:41:11,462
What do you want?

502
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:15,758
Mr. Grinch, l came to invite you...

503
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:18,970
...to be holiday cheermeister.

504
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:24,517
-''Holiday Whobie-what-y''?
-Cheermeister.

505
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:27,896
''Cheermeister. Celebrate with friends.''

506
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:33,735
That's a good one.

507
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:38,531
l know you hate Christmas,
but what if it's all just a misunderstanding?

508
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:42,368
-Don't care.
-l myself am having some Yuletide doubts.

509
00:41:43,036 --> 00:41:46,539
But maybe if you reunite
with the Whos and be a part of Christmas--

510
00:41:46,623 --> 00:41:49,626
''Maybe if you reunite with the Whos
and be a part of Christmas.''

511
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:50,710
Grow up!

512
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:52,879
Then maybe it'll be all right for me, too!

513
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:54,464
l'm sorry, your session is over.

514
00:41:54,547 --> 00:41:57,717
Please make another appointment
with the receptionist on the way out.

515
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,178
Please, please.
You have to accept the award.

516
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:07,435
Award?

517
00:42:09,854 --> 00:42:12,941
You never mentioned an award!

518
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:15,568
Yeah, with a trophy and everything.

519
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:17,695
-And l won?
-You won!

520
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,407
-That means there were losers.
-l guess.

521
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:25,787
-So, if you come--
-A town full of losers!

522
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:27,789
l like it.

523
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:31,167
Was anyone emotionally shattered?

524
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:35,380
Come on, a minute ago
l couldn't shut you up! Details, details!

525
00:42:36,631 --> 00:42:37,882
The Mayor wasn't happy.

526
00:42:40,176 --> 00:42:41,427
Oh, no.

527
00:42:42,095 --> 00:42:43,805
Martha May will be there.

528
00:42:45,598 --> 00:42:47,100
She will?

529
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:49,978
And she'll see me.

530
00:42:50,562 --> 00:42:51,646
A winner.

531
00:42:53,189 --> 00:42:56,943
She'll be on me like fleegle flies
on a flat-faced floogle horse.

532
00:42:57,026 --> 00:43:01,573
l'm sorry to disappoint you, Martha, baby,
but the G train has left the station.

533
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:03,908
So, will you come?

534
00:43:04,576 --> 00:43:05,994
All right.

535
00:43:06,828 --> 00:43:09,622
l don't know if it's
that adorable twinkle in your eye...

536
00:43:09,706 --> 00:43:11,291
...or that nonconformist streak...

537
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:15,003
...that reminds me of a younger,
less hairy me.

538
00:43:15,336 --> 00:43:17,213
But you've convinced me.

539
00:43:17,422 --> 00:43:22,385
Who knows? This Whobilation
could change my entire outlook on life!

540
00:43:23,052 --> 00:43:24,762
-Really?
-No.

541
00:43:58,796 --> 00:44:00,673
There you are, honey.

542
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:03,259
You can make snow angels later.

543
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:05,762
We can't be late for the Whobilation!

544
00:44:09,307 --> 00:44:10,767
The nerve of those Whos.

545
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:14,270
lnviting me down there
on such short notice.

546
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:17,982
Even if l wanted to go,
my schedule wouldn't allow it.

547
00:44:20,443 --> 00:44:23,238
''4:00, wallow in self-pity.

548
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:26,241
''4:30, stare into the abyss.

549
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:29,118
''5:00, solve world hunger...

550
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:31,287
''...tell no one.

551
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:33,248
''5:30, jazzercise.

552
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:36,376
''6:30, dinner with me.''
l can't cancel that again.

553
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:40,129
''7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing.''

554
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,714
l'm booked.

555
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,093
lf l bumped the loathing to 9:00,
l 'd have time to lay in bed...

556
00:44:45,176 --> 00:44:48,930
...stare at the ceiling
and slip slowly into madness.

557
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:51,432
But what would l wear?

558
00:45:11,786 --> 00:45:14,080
lt's not a dress, it's a kilt!

559
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,750
Sicko!

560
00:45:18,835 --> 00:45:19,836
Stupid.

561
00:45:20,003 --> 00:45:21,004
Ugly.

562
00:45:21,129 --> 00:45:22,589
Out of date.

563
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:25,717
This is ridiculous.

564
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,304
lf l can't find something nice to wear,
l'm not going!

565
00:45:47,488 --> 00:45:49,365
That's it, l'm not going.

566
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:05,965
It's time for our Holiday Cheermeister
of the Year Award!

567
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,683
Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!

568
00:46:18,311 --> 00:46:19,812
He isn't here.

569
00:46:20,438 --> 00:46:21,606
What?

570
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:24,192
He didn’t show?

571
00:46:25,902 --> 00:46:27,779
Who could have predicted this?

572
00:46:29,072 --> 00:46:33,159
All right. l'll swing by for a minute,
allow them to envy me...

573
00:46:33,243 --> 00:46:36,412
...grab a handful of popcorn shrimp,
and blow out of there.

574
00:46:36,913 --> 00:46:40,500
But what if it's a cruel prank?
What if it's a cash bar?

575
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:42,877
How dare they?

576
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,004
All right, l'll go.

577
00:46:45,088 --> 00:46:46,589
But l'll be fashionably late.

578
00:46:46,756 --> 00:46:48,967
No. Yes. No. Yes. No!

579
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:50,134
Yes!

580
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,346
Definitely not!

581
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:56,182
All right. l've made my decision!

582
00:46:56,724 --> 00:46:59,102
l'm going, and that's that.

583
00:47:00,645 --> 00:47:02,063
Had my fingers crossed.

584
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,778
Maybe l should flip a coin!

585
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:19,497
I guess the award goes to...

586
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:21,040
...the runner-up.

587
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:26,880
That's right. A man for whom
Christmas comes not once a year...

588
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:29,465
...but every minute of every day.

589
00:47:29,924 --> 00:47:32,385
A handsome, noble man.

590
00:47:33,094 --> 00:47:35,221
A man who
has had his tonsils removed twice!

591
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:38,224
That's an interesting story.

592
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:40,518
You see, what happened was--

593
00:47:55,491 --> 00:47:56,743
Hello, Martha.

594
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:57,952
He made it!

595
00:47:58,328 --> 00:47:59,412
-Cindy.
-Honey!

596
00:48:23,478 --> 00:48:24,479
Look--

597
00:48:27,148 --> 00:48:28,942
Hot crowd. Hot crowd.

598
00:48:30,985 --> 00:48:33,029
l believe l'm here to...

599
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:37,909
...accept an award of some kind.

600
00:48:40,245 --> 00:48:43,998
And the child mentioned a check.

601
00:48:44,499 --> 00:48:47,043
-No, l didn't.
-All right, then, give me the award.

602
00:48:47,168 --> 00:48:49,128
Come on, while l'm young!

603
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:53,675
Don’t you worry, Mr. Holiday Cheermeister,
you'll get your award.

604
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,845
But first, a little family reunion.

605
00:48:58,888 --> 00:49:02,058
They nursed you. They clothed you.

606
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:03,685
Here they are...

607
00:49:03,768 --> 00:49:06,604
...your old biddies!

608
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:10,692
Are you two still living?

609
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:12,777
We missed you!

610
00:49:13,861 --> 00:49:16,072
Rose. The sweater. The sweater, Rose.

611
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:19,158
Sweater? What are you talkin' about?
No, l can't!

612
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:20,869
l can't do that!

613
00:49:23,454 --> 00:49:25,248
Don't touch me there!

614
00:49:33,089 --> 00:49:35,300
Put him in the Chair of Cheer!

615
00:49:35,383 --> 00:49:36,801
Chair of Cheer?

616
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:38,678
What's the Chair of Cheer?

617
00:49:38,887 --> 00:49:41,014
You didn't tell me about the Chair of Cheer.

618
00:49:41,097 --> 00:49:43,474
Please, Mr. Grinch.

619
00:49:44,684 --> 00:49:46,269
No. l can't do it, honestly.

620
00:49:46,352 --> 00:49:48,146
l'm not ready. lt's too much, too soon!

621
00:49:48,438 --> 00:49:50,315
It's that time of year.

622
00:49:50,398 --> 00:49:52,692
The Cheermeister's ride
in the Chair of Cheer!

623
00:49:53,693 --> 00:49:55,820
Put me down! l mean it!

624
00:49:55,904 --> 00:49:57,280
l've got a lawyer.

625
00:49:57,363 --> 00:49:59,324
There'll be hell to pay!

626
00:50:00,742 --> 00:50:03,828
First, you'll put
your taste buds to the test...

627
00:50:03,912 --> 00:50:08,291
...as you judge the Who pudding cook-off!

628
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:10,877
-Mine first.
-l really don't know--

629
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,670
No, mine's the best!

630
00:50:13,087 --> 00:50:14,714
You'll enjoy this!

631
00:50:15,715 --> 00:50:17,759
This is not pudding.

632
00:50:18,676 --> 00:50:19,928
What is it?

633
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:24,265
This is mine. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

634
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:26,392
Christmas conga!

635
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:29,520
Look at the time.
l really should be getting back.

636
00:50:29,604 --> 00:50:31,481
All right!

637
00:50:36,277 --> 00:50:37,904
Fruitcake, tra-la-la!

638
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:40,240
No.

639
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:47,539
Fudge Judge.

640
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:51,501
Made it myself.

641
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:53,461
Yeah? Mine are homemade too.

642
00:50:54,045 --> 00:50:55,213
Okay.

643
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:57,715
Put it in. Bring it on!

644
00:50:58,424 --> 00:51:00,301
ls that all you got?

645
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:02,262
ls that all you got? Come on.

646
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:09,769
Out of the way, slow-mo!

647
00:51:11,437 --> 00:51:12,522
Excuse me.

648
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:28,162
He's number one in the sack race run!

649
00:51:28,246 --> 00:51:31,416
Number one! l'm number one!

650
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,626
l'm number one!

651
00:51:34,168 --> 00:51:37,338
No child can beat the Grinch!

652
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:44,262
l beat you.

653
00:51:52,604 --> 00:51:53,938
He won!

654
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,027
And now it's time
for the moment we've all been waiting for.

655
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,654
Yes! My award.

656
00:52:01,863 --> 00:52:03,823
-Write the check.
-There's no check.

657
00:52:03,907 --> 00:52:07,410
Are you sure? Because I thought
I heard someone mention a check.

658
00:52:07,493 --> 00:52:10,246
I said, there's no check.
And now it's time...

659
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,624
...for Present Pass-it-on!

660
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:16,169
As always, we start with our Cheermeister.

661
00:52:24,802 --> 00:52:27,347
The gift of a Christmas shave.

662
00:52:41,694 --> 00:52:43,655
Look at that hack job!

663
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,501
Yes, yes, yes. Good times!

664
00:52:58,002 --> 00:52:59,087
Good times.

665
00:53:00,421 --> 00:53:04,259
And now, l have a little something
for the love of my life.

666
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,011
Martha May...

667
00:53:09,347 --> 00:53:12,350
...please become Mrs. Augustus May-Who.

668
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:22,068
Augustus....

669
00:53:22,986 --> 00:53:24,779
lf you agree to be my wife...

670
00:53:24,988 --> 00:53:29,284
...along with a lifetime supply of happiness,
you'll also receive this:

671
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,581
It's a new car!

672
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,043
Generously provided
by the taxpayers of Whoville!

673
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,755
What do you say, Martha?

674
00:53:43,506 --> 00:53:46,509
You got 20 seconds on the clock.

675
00:53:49,804 --> 00:53:50,805
I....

676
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:56,769
These gifts are quite dazzling.

677
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:09,490
Of course they are.

678
00:54:10,491 --> 00:54:12,368
That's what it's all about, isn't it?

679
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:16,039
That's what it's always been about!

680
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:18,333
Gifts!

681
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,043
Gifts.

682
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,587
Gifts, gifts, gifts.

683
00:54:23,421 --> 00:54:25,715
You want to know what happens
to your gifts?

684
00:54:25,882 --> 00:54:28,676
They all come to me. ln your garbage.

685
00:54:29,093 --> 00:54:30,470
You see what l'm saying?

686
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:32,597
ln your garbage!

687
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:38,478
l could hang myself with all the bad
Christmas neckties l found at the dump!

688
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:41,189
And the avarice.

689
00:54:42,941 --> 00:54:45,944
The avarice never ends!

690
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:47,946
''l want golf clubs.'' ''l want diamonds.''

691
00:54:48,071 --> 00:54:51,991
''l want a pony, so l can ride it twice,
get bored, and sell it to make glue.''

692
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:57,789
Look, l don't want to make waves,
but this whole Christmas season is...

693
00:54:57,997 --> 00:55:00,375
...stupid, stupid, stupid!

694
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:03,586
There is, however...

695
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,215
...one teeny-tiny...

696
00:55:07,757 --> 00:55:09,384
...Christmas tradition...

697
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:11,427
...l find...

698
00:55:12,095 --> 00:55:14,847
...quite meaningful.

699
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:21,563
Mistletoe.

700
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,774
Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville!

701
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:36,119
Somebody's fabulous!

702
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:41,332
All right, your turn! Go on!

703
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:50,758
-Let's go!
-No!

704
00:55:51,384 --> 00:55:52,886
Excuse me, old-timer.

705
00:55:53,803 --> 00:55:55,597
Mind if l wet my whistle?

706
00:56:00,518 --> 00:56:02,145
That's my good stuff!

707
00:56:10,153 --> 00:56:12,780
Burn, baby! Burn!

708
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:28,546
The Whomanity!

709
00:56:29,047 --> 00:56:30,381
-Let's go! Come on!
-No, wait!

710
00:56:30,632 --> 00:56:33,092
-Do something.
-Right!

711
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,644
Calling all units. Calling all units.

712
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:48,191
Taxi!

713
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:52,904
lt's because l'm green, isn't it?

714
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,244
Halt!

715
00:57:00,703 --> 00:57:03,665
Evening, folks. Mind if l ride along?

716
00:57:03,915 --> 00:57:06,125
You might want to scooch over.

717
00:57:08,211 --> 00:57:09,796
You did the right thing.

718
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:19,806
Out of the way!

719
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:31,985
That's gonna hurt in the morning.

720
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:58,136
lt's gonna blow!

721
00:58:15,737 --> 00:58:17,238
You fellas all right?

722
00:58:17,322 --> 00:58:19,115
How about a nice hat?

723
00:58:19,574 --> 00:58:20,742
Lou?

724
00:58:29,834 --> 00:58:31,169
l'm hurt, Lou.

725
00:58:32,503 --> 00:58:34,797
l'm hurt, and l don't hurt easily.

726
00:58:34,923 --> 00:58:37,675
But you and your family....

727
00:58:38,676 --> 00:58:40,261
l'm so...

728
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:41,930
...disappointed.

729
00:58:43,765 --> 00:58:46,059
Can we just get back to Christmas...

730
00:58:46,476 --> 00:58:48,853
...the way it should be?

731
00:58:49,729 --> 00:58:51,272
Grinch-less?

732
00:58:51,814 --> 00:58:54,108
Merry Christmas!

733
00:58:55,151 --> 00:58:57,445
Merry Christmas!

734
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:05,537
l just wanted everybody
to be together for Christmas.

735
00:59:08,581 --> 00:59:10,375
l quite enjoyed that.

736
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,460
l hope l get another invite soon.

737
00:59:17,882 --> 00:59:19,259
Come on, come on!

738
00:59:19,342 --> 00:59:21,469
Good thing we have a spare.

739
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,641
Suffering snorkelblatz!

740
00:59:27,058 --> 00:59:29,185
They're relentless!

741
00:59:34,816 --> 00:59:38,486
Only four hours till Christmas!

742
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,117
Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow
all the Who girls and boys...

743
00:59:44,409 --> 00:59:47,579
...would wake bright and early
and rush for their toys.

744
00:59:47,704 --> 00:59:50,623
And then, the noise!

745
00:59:50,832 --> 00:59:54,669
The noise, noise, noise!

746
00:59:55,253 --> 00:59:57,380
They'll bang on tong-tinglers.

747
00:59:57,505 --> 00:59:59,632
They'll blow their floo-flounders.

748
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:03,595
They'll crash on jang-jinglers
and bounce on boing-bounders!

749
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:08,141
Then Whos young and old
would sit down to a feast.

750
01:00:08,224 --> 01:00:10,852
And they'll feast and they'll feast.

751
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:14,606
And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast!

752
01:00:14,856 --> 01:00:16,733
They'll eat their Who pudding.

753
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:20,695
And rare Who roast beast!

754
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:25,366
But there's something
l just cannot stand in the least.

755
01:00:25,742 --> 01:00:26,910
Oh, no.

756
01:00:27,285 --> 01:00:30,872
l'm speaking in rhyme!

757
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:39,214
Blast you Whos!

758
01:00:43,676 --> 01:00:47,972
And the more the Grinch thought
of what Christmas would bring...

759
01:00:48,306 --> 01:00:50,516
...the more the Grinch thought:

760
01:00:50,642 --> 01:00:53,561
l must stop this whole thing.

761
01:00:55,104 --> 01:00:59,108
Why, for year after year
l've put up with it now!

762
01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:02,695
l must stop this Christmas from coming!
But how?

763
01:01:03,905 --> 01:01:06,199
l mean, in what way?

764
01:01:09,452 --> 01:01:13,581
''Christmas is goin' to the dogs

765
01:01:14,874 --> 01:01:18,628
''We're scoffing down
the turkey and the grog

766
01:01:21,422 --> 01:01:23,883
''Things are looking very good, it's true''

767
01:01:25,426 --> 01:01:28,763
Are you having a holly, jolly...

768
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:31,432
...Christmas?

769
01:01:32,892 --> 01:01:34,352
Wrong-o!

770
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:54,330
lf you're not going to help me...

771
01:01:54,664 --> 01:01:56,875
...then you might as well....

772
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,127
Then he got an idea.

773
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:02,088
An awful idea.

774
01:02:02,964 --> 01:02:05,174
The Grinch got a wonderful...

775
01:02:05,633 --> 01:02:07,594
...awful idea.

776
01:02:07,927 --> 01:02:12,307
l know just what to do.

777
01:02:20,815 --> 01:02:23,359
The Grinch laughed in his throat.

778
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,654
And he made a quick
Santy Claus hat and a coat.

779
01:02:29,908 --> 01:02:32,577
And he chuckled and clucked...

780
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:35,205
...at this great Grinchy trick.

781
01:02:35,288 --> 01:02:39,209
With this coat and this hat,
l'll look just like Saint Nick.

782
01:02:41,044 --> 01:02:44,047
''You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch

783
01:02:45,798 --> 01:02:49,552
''You really are a heel

784
01:02:50,136 --> 01:02:54,265
''You're as cuddly as a cactus
and as charming as an eel

785
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:56,893
''Mr. Grinch

786
01:02:57,602 --> 01:02:59,395
''You're a bad banana

787
01:02:59,854 --> 01:03:03,274
''With a greasy black peel

788
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,033
''Just face the music, you're a monster

789
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,911
''Mr. Grinch, yes, you are

790
01:03:15,411 --> 01:03:19,499
''Your heart's an empty hole

791
01:03:19,874 --> 01:03:23,628
''Your brain is full of spiders
You got garlic in your soul

792
01:03:23,753 --> 01:03:26,130
''Mr. Grinch

793
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:29,592
''I wouldn't touch you with a

794
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:34,180
''thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole''

795
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:49,070
l asked for three-quarters, not five-eighths.

796
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:50,738
Stay focused!

797
01:03:57,036 --> 01:04:00,373
''You know, if you asked
the who's who of Whoville

798
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:05,336
''No one would deny it''

799
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:27,692
Air bag is a little slow.

800
01:04:30,111 --> 01:04:32,655
But that's what these tests are for!

801
01:04:33,573 --> 01:04:35,450
''You're a vile one

802
01:04:36,034 --> 01:04:37,452
''Mr. Grinch

803
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:42,498
''You have termites in your smile

804
01:04:43,124 --> 01:04:47,587
''You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile

805
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,881
''Mr. Grinch

806
01:04:51,174 --> 01:04:53,468
''Given the choice between you

807
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:56,888
''l'd take the seasick crocodile''

808
01:05:19,786 --> 01:05:23,373
Fat boy should be finishing up
anytime now.

809
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:26,251
Talk about a recluse.

810
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:30,713
He only comes out once a year,
and he never catches any flak for it!

811
01:05:32,048 --> 01:05:34,801
Probably lives up there to avoid the taxes.

812
01:05:36,844 --> 01:05:39,389
Merry Christmas!

813
01:05:41,224 --> 01:05:42,475
Oopsie.

814
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,937
Forgot about the reindeer.

815
01:05:46,771 --> 01:05:49,440
Did that stop the old Grinch?

816
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:51,734
No.

817
01:05:51,859 --> 01:05:53,903
The Grinch simply said:

818
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,864
lf l can't find a reindeer...

819
01:05:57,699 --> 01:06:00,952
...l'll make one instead.

820
01:06:05,331 --> 01:06:09,002
Oh, Max!

821
01:06:12,297 --> 01:06:14,257
So he called his dog Max...

822
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:16,885
...and he took some red thread...

823
01:06:17,093 --> 01:06:20,513
...and tied a big horn on top of his head.

824
01:06:24,183 --> 01:06:25,184
All right.

825
01:06:25,727 --> 01:06:28,605
You're a reindeer. Here's your motivation.

826
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:31,858
You're Rudolph, a freak with a red nose,
nobody likes you.

827
01:06:31,941 --> 01:06:34,903
Then one day,
Santa picks you and you save Christmas.

828
01:06:37,322 --> 01:06:39,699
No, forget that part. We'll improvise.

829
01:06:39,824 --> 01:06:42,285
Just keep it kind of loosey-goosey.

830
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:44,579
You hate Christmas! You're gonna steal it!

831
01:06:44,996 --> 01:06:48,499
Saving Christmas was a lousy ending.
Way too commercial.

832
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:51,502
Action!

833
01:06:54,172 --> 01:06:55,340
Brilliant!

834
01:06:55,757 --> 01:06:57,717
You reject your own nose...

835
01:06:57,842 --> 01:07:00,511
...because it represents the
glitter of commercialism!

836
01:07:00,595 --> 01:07:02,388
Why didn't l think of that?

837
01:07:02,472 --> 01:07:04,682
Cut, print, check the gate. Moving on.

838
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:15,985
That...

839
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:17,528
...feels...

840
01:07:17,612 --> 01:07:19,739
...good.

841
01:07:31,084 --> 01:07:33,878
Here goes nothin', hot dog!

842
01:07:39,717 --> 01:07:40,802
Wow!

843
01:07:54,941 --> 01:07:57,318
This is nuts!

844
01:07:59,362 --> 01:08:01,406
On, Crasher! On, Thrasher!

845
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:03,866
On, Vomit and Blitzkrieg!

846
01:08:12,709 --> 01:08:14,168
We're gonna die!

847
01:08:14,294 --> 01:08:16,004
We're gonna die!

848
01:08:16,379 --> 01:08:19,799
l'm going to throw up,
and then l'm gonna die!

849
01:08:22,218 --> 01:08:25,305
Mommy, tell it to stop!

850
01:08:44,282 --> 01:08:47,035
Almost lost my cool there.

851
01:08:52,248 --> 01:08:56,461
All their windows were dark.
Quiet snow filled the air.

852
01:08:56,669 --> 01:09:00,924
All the Whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care...

853
01:09:01,049 --> 01:09:03,718
...when he came to the first
little house on the square.

854
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:05,845
Welcome to Whoville, Max.

855
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:14,854
Betty?

856
01:09:15,146 --> 01:09:16,397
-Betty?
-What?

857
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:18,441
Did you hear something?

858
01:09:20,401 --> 01:09:21,736
lt's Santa!

859
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:23,780
Go right back to sleep.

860
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,497
Come on, Max. lt's our first stop.

861
01:09:32,747 --> 01:09:34,958
The old Grinchy Claus hissed.

862
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:37,919
And he climbed to the roof,
empty bags in his fist.

863
01:09:38,002 --> 01:09:41,339
He'd slide down the chimney.
A rather tight pinch.

864
01:09:41,631 --> 01:09:44,717
But if Santa could do it,
then so could the Grinch.

865
01:09:45,176 --> 01:09:48,763
He's planning a double-twisting
interrupted forward-flying 2-and-a-half...

866
01:09:48,846 --> 01:09:50,473
...with a combo tuck and pike.

867
01:09:50,598 --> 01:09:52,225
High degree of difficulty.

868
01:10:00,275 --> 01:10:03,611
He got stuck only once,
for a moment or two.

869
01:10:03,736 --> 01:10:07,407
Blasted water weight!
Goes right to my hips.

870
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:20,253
Then he stuck his head
out of the fireplace flue.

871
01:10:21,629 --> 01:10:23,923
A little more stealth, please.

872
01:10:24,299 --> 01:10:26,759
Where the little Who stockings
all hung in a row.

873
01:10:26,843 --> 01:10:27,927
These stockings...

874
01:10:28,052 --> 01:10:28,970
...he grinned...

875
01:10:29,095 --> 01:10:30,889
...are the first thing to go.

876
01:10:31,347 --> 01:10:33,808
Okay, fellas. Show time.

877
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:07,717
Then he slunk to the icebox.

878
01:11:09,052 --> 01:11:10,136
Slunk?

879
01:11:12,347 --> 01:11:16,267
He eyed the Whos' feast.
He took the Who pudding.

880
01:11:17,435 --> 01:11:19,562
He took the roast beast.

881
01:11:20,104 --> 01:11:21,189
Hike!

882
01:11:22,523 --> 01:11:24,817
He cleaned out that icebox
as quick as a flash.

883
01:11:24,943 --> 01:11:28,863
Why, that Grinch,
he even took their last can of Who hash.

884
01:11:29,948 --> 01:11:33,451
Then he stuffed all the food
up the chimney with glee.

885
01:11:34,118 --> 01:11:35,745
And now...

886
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,747
...grinned the Grinch...

887
01:11:39,707 --> 01:11:41,501
...l'll stuff up the tree.

888
01:11:41,584 --> 01:11:44,587
And the Grinch grabbed the tree,
and he started to shove...

889
01:11:45,296 --> 01:11:48,967
...when he heard a small sound
like the coo of a dove.

890
01:11:49,092 --> 01:11:50,510
Excuse me.

891
01:11:56,516 --> 01:11:59,769
The Grinch had been caught
by this tiny Who daughter...

892
01:11:59,978 --> 01:12:02,522
...who'd got out of bed
for a cup of cold water.

893
01:12:02,647 --> 01:12:06,067
Santa Claus?
What are you doing with our tree?

894
01:12:06,609 --> 01:12:10,530
But, you know, that old Grinch
was so smart and so slick...

895
01:12:12,156 --> 01:12:15,076
...he thought up a lie,
and he thought it up quick.

896
01:12:15,618 --> 01:12:16,870
Why...

897
01:12:16,995 --> 01:12:19,831
...my sweet little tot.

898
01:12:20,081 --> 01:12:21,708
The fake Santa Claus lied.

899
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:24,377
There's a light on this tree...

900
01:12:25,086 --> 01:12:26,504
...that won't...

901
01:12:26,588 --> 01:12:28,548
...light on one side.

902
01:12:29,007 --> 01:12:33,094
So l'm taking it home
to my workshop, my dear.

903
01:12:38,182 --> 01:12:40,310
l'll fix it up there...

904
01:12:40,727 --> 01:12:44,397
...and l'll bring it back here.

905
01:12:46,232 --> 01:12:48,192
Santa, what's Christmas really about?

906
01:12:48,484 --> 01:12:50,278
Vengeance!

907
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:53,281
l mean...

908
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:57,410
...presents...

909
01:12:58,494 --> 01:12:59,954
...l suppose.

910
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,793
l was afraid of that.

911
01:13:07,295 --> 01:13:10,465
And his fib fooled the child.

912
01:13:10,757 --> 01:13:14,093
Then he patted her head,
and he got her a drink...

913
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:16,596
...and he sent her to bed.

914
01:13:24,354 --> 01:13:25,355
Santa?

915
01:13:26,064 --> 01:13:29,400
-What?
-Don't forget the Grinch.

916
01:13:30,193 --> 01:13:32,153
l know he's mean and hairy and smelly.

917
01:13:34,113 --> 01:13:36,574
His hands might be cold and clammy.

918
01:13:38,076 --> 01:13:41,579
But l think he's actually kind of sweet.

919
01:13:41,955 --> 01:13:43,039
Sweet?

920
01:13:50,755 --> 01:13:52,549
You think he's sweet?

921
01:13:53,424 --> 01:13:55,218
Merry Christmas, Santa.

922
01:14:02,308 --> 01:14:05,228
And when Cindy Lou
went up with her cup...

923
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:06,980
Nice kid.

924
01:14:07,897 --> 01:14:10,525
Bad judge of character.

925
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:14,404
...he went to the chimney
and stuffed the tree up.

926
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:25,832
And the last thing he took
was the log for their fire.

927
01:14:25,915 --> 01:14:30,086
On their walls he left nothing
but some hooks and some wire.

928
01:14:30,211 --> 01:14:32,964
And the one speck of food
that he'd left in the house...

929
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:36,384
...was a crumb that was even
too small for a mouse.

930
01:14:39,512 --> 01:14:43,766
Then he slithered and slunk,
with a smile most unpleasant...

931
01:14:43,933 --> 01:14:47,687
...around each Who home,
and he took every present.

932
01:14:58,948 --> 01:15:00,033
Clearance sale.

933
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:02,118
Everything must go.

934
01:15:15,173 --> 01:15:17,133
What now?

935
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:53,711
Martha...

936
01:15:53,962 --> 01:15:57,799
...have you ever kissed a man
who lost his tonsils twice?

937
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:00,843
No, silly!

938
01:16:04,931 --> 01:16:08,518
But it's an experience
that l've always longed for.

939
01:16:08,935 --> 01:16:10,645
Kiss me, you fool!

940
01:17:33,436 --> 01:17:35,480
What are you laughing at...

941
01:17:36,314 --> 01:17:38,274
...Rudolph?

942
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,444
lt's all you, Maxie!

943
01:17:41,527 --> 01:17:44,948
3,000 feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit...

944
01:17:45,031 --> 01:17:48,618
...he rode with his load
to the tiptop to dump it.

945
01:17:58,545 --> 01:18:01,714
We did it!

946
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:08,930
We did it! We did it!

947
01:18:09,556 --> 01:18:11,599
That wasn't so bad, was it, Max?

948
01:18:15,478 --> 01:18:17,272
They'll be waking up now.

949
01:18:19,482 --> 01:18:23,236
And l know just what they'll do.

950
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,197
All those Whos...

951
01:18:26,614 --> 01:18:28,324
...down in Whoville...

952
01:18:28,449 --> 01:18:30,743
...will all cry.

953
01:18:48,887 --> 01:18:51,514
What an embarrassment!
l've been robbed!

954
01:19:21,586 --> 01:19:23,796
Mayor May-Who? Oh, dear.

955
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:34,224
l wonder who could have done this.

956
01:19:36,184 --> 01:19:37,685
Tell you people one thing:

957
01:19:38,311 --> 01:19:39,854
lnvite the Grinch...

958
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,357
...destroy Christmas.

959
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:44,567
lnvite the Grinch...

960
01:19:44,692 --> 01:19:47,487
...destroy Christmas!

961
01:19:50,657 --> 01:19:53,409
But did anyone listen to me?

962
01:19:53,493 --> 01:19:55,203
-l did.
-No.

963
01:19:55,286 --> 01:19:58,289
You choose to listen...

964
01:19:58,456 --> 01:20:03,086
...to a little not-to-be-taken-seriously girl...

965
01:20:04,045 --> 01:20:07,298
...who hasn't even grown into her nose yet.

966
01:20:08,883 --> 01:20:11,970
Cindy, l hope you're very proud...

967
01:20:12,387 --> 01:20:13,638
...of what you've done.

968
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:24,440
lf she isn't, l am.

969
01:20:26,609 --> 01:20:28,486
l'm glad he took our presents.

970
01:20:30,405 --> 01:20:32,198
-What?
-l....

971
01:20:34,993 --> 01:20:37,120
-l'm glad.
-He's glad.

972
01:20:37,996 --> 01:20:40,957
You're glad.
You're glad everything is gone.

973
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:46,337
You're glad that the Grinch
virtually wrecked....

974
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:48,882
No, not wrecked, pulverized Christmas.

975
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:50,675
ls that what l'm hearing?

976
01:20:51,759 --> 01:20:53,970
You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor...

977
01:20:54,053 --> 01:20:58,057
...because it isn't about the gifts
or the contests or the fancy lights.

978
01:20:58,141 --> 01:21:01,394
That's what Cindy's been trying
to tell everyone.

979
01:21:01,936 --> 01:21:04,147
And me. She's been trying to tell me.

980
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:07,650
What is wrong with you? This is a child.

981
01:21:08,526 --> 01:21:10,153
She's my child.

982
01:21:10,236 --> 01:21:13,072
And she happens to be right, by the way.

983
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:25,877
l don't need anything more for Christmas
than this right here, my family.

984
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:32,467
-Merry Christmas, everybody!
-Merry Christmas!

985
01:21:33,968 --> 01:21:37,972
Merry Christmas, you hunk of burnin' Who!

986
01:21:45,396 --> 01:21:47,023
Give me a break.

987
01:21:54,864 --> 01:21:55,949
Merry Christmas!

988
01:22:08,586 --> 01:22:09,754
Mr. Grinch?

989
01:22:11,214 --> 01:22:13,174
Mr. Grinch?

990
01:22:13,258 --> 01:22:16,094
Now for the final note in my symphony...

991
01:22:16,177 --> 01:22:19,180
...of downright nasty not-niceness!

992
01:22:19,514 --> 01:22:22,767
The crescendo of my odious opus!

993
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:31,401
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

994
01:22:31,901 --> 01:22:36,364
The bellowing of the bitterly bummed out!

995
01:22:36,906 --> 01:22:40,076
lt'll be like music to my ears!

996
01:22:48,418 --> 01:22:52,630
Then the Grinch heard
a sound rising over the snow.

997
01:22:52,755 --> 01:22:56,801
It started in low. Then it started to grow.

998
01:22:59,178 --> 01:23:01,639
But the sound wasn’t sad.

999
01:23:02,307 --> 01:23:05,101
Why, this sounded merry.

1000
01:23:05,977 --> 01:23:08,354
But it was merry.

1001
01:23:08,521 --> 01:23:09,689
Very.

1002
01:23:09,898 --> 01:23:13,818
Every Who down in Whoville,
the tall and the small...

1003
01:23:13,943 --> 01:23:17,196
...were singing without any presents at all.

1004
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:25,830
He hadn’t stopped Christmas from coming.

1005
01:23:26,122 --> 01:23:27,123
It came.

1006
01:23:27,248 --> 01:23:30,501
Somehow or other, it came just the same!

1007
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,924
Mr. Grinch?

1008
01:23:38,718 --> 01:23:42,555
And the Grinch,
with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow...

1009
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,308
...stood puzzling and puzzling.

1010
01:23:45,642 --> 01:23:47,769
How could it be so?

1011
01:23:48,061 --> 01:23:49,854
lt came without ribbons!

1012
01:23:50,271 --> 01:23:52,649
lt came without tags!

1013
01:23:52,899 --> 01:23:56,236
lt came without packages, boxes or bags!

1014
01:23:59,322 --> 01:24:02,158
And he puzzled and puzzled...

1015
01:24:02,242 --> 01:24:04,702
...till his puzzler was sore.

1016
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:11,042
Then the Grinch thought of something...

1017
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:12,877
...he hadn't before.

1018
01:24:13,127 --> 01:24:14,379
Maybe...

1019
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:16,881
...Christmas...

1020
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:18,841
...he thought...

1021
01:24:21,135 --> 01:24:24,806
...doesn't come from a store.

1022
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,186
Maybe Christmas...

1023
01:24:31,521 --> 01:24:32,939
...perhaps...

1024
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:41,281
...means a little bit more.

1025
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:16,232
Help me!

1026
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:18,192
l'm...

1027
01:25:19,235 --> 01:25:20,695
...feeling!

1028
01:25:27,493 --> 01:25:29,621
And what happened then...

1029
01:25:29,954 --> 01:25:32,498
...well, in Whoville they say...

1030
01:25:32,749 --> 01:25:35,418
...that the Grinch's small heart...

1031
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:39,422
...grew three sizes that day.

1032
01:26:10,828 --> 01:26:14,082
What's happening to me?

1033
01:26:37,564 --> 01:26:38,898
l'm all...

1034
01:26:40,233 --> 01:26:42,026
...toasty inside.

1035
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,578
And l'm leaking.

1036
01:26:54,914 --> 01:26:55,999
Oh, Max.

1037
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:01,671
l love you!

1038
01:27:09,721 --> 01:27:12,807
All right, that's enough.
Knock it off. Beat it!

1039
01:27:13,474 --> 01:27:15,101
Get out of here!

1040
01:27:15,268 --> 01:27:17,145
One step at a time.

1041
01:27:25,528 --> 01:27:28,615
No. The sleigh. The presents.

1042
01:27:28,823 --> 01:27:30,199
They'll be destroyed!

1043
01:27:30,283 --> 01:27:31,659
And l care!

1044
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:34,704
What is the deal?

1045
01:27:35,538 --> 01:27:37,040
Wait!

1046
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:39,792
This can't happen!

1047
01:27:39,918 --> 01:27:43,087
lt shouldn't! lt couldn't!
lt mustn't! lt wouldn't!

1048
01:27:43,713 --> 01:27:46,174
Not now, not then, not ever again!

1049
01:27:56,434 --> 01:27:57,894
No!

1050
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:48,236
Oh, well.

1051
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:51,531
lt's just toys, right?

1052
01:28:53,032 --> 01:28:54,659
Hi, Mr. Grinch!

1053
01:28:56,911 --> 01:28:58,538
Cindy Lou!

1054
01:28:58,663 --> 01:29:00,957
What are you doing up there?

1055
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:05,628
l came to see you.
No one should be alone on Christmas.

1056
01:29:22,103 --> 01:29:23,104
No!

1057
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:57,263
l got you, Cindy Lou!

1058
01:29:57,805 --> 01:29:58,890
You did it!

1059
01:30:40,932 --> 01:30:43,226
Spread eagle! Nailed it!

1060
01:31:00,910 --> 01:31:02,537
Are you all right?

1061
01:31:02,829 --> 01:31:04,080
Are you kiddin'?

1062
01:31:04,163 --> 01:31:06,624
The sun is bright and the powder's bitchin'!

1063
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:09,252
Now scoot over! lt's my turn to drive!

1064
01:31:16,759 --> 01:31:18,469
l'd better slow this buggy down!

1065
01:31:22,348 --> 01:31:26,019
-We're gonna crash!
-Now you listen to me, young lady!

1066
01:31:26,603 --> 01:31:29,147
Even if we're horribly mangled...

1067
01:31:29,898 --> 01:31:31,858
...there'll be no sad faces on Christmas.

1068
01:31:42,869 --> 01:31:44,245
What is it?

1069
01:31:44,746 --> 01:31:46,122
Help!

1070
01:31:46,372 --> 01:31:47,999
-Cindy!
-Grinch?

1071
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,170
My baby!

1072
01:31:56,382 --> 01:31:57,383
Grab an end.

1073
01:31:57,759 --> 01:32:00,303
By the way,
these lights match your outfit perfectly.

1074
01:32:03,014 --> 01:32:05,141
This could be more difficult to negotiate.

1075
01:32:05,642 --> 01:32:07,852
Heads up, Whoville!

1076
01:32:08,144 --> 01:32:09,938
Hurry! Here he comes!

1077
01:32:11,147 --> 01:32:13,691
Out of the way! l have no insurance!

1078
01:32:17,028 --> 01:32:18,279
Yeah!

1079
01:32:25,245 --> 01:32:26,329
Run for your lives!

1080
01:32:26,412 --> 01:32:28,456
Watch out, l can't stop!

1081
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:32,794
-Daddy, move!
-Dad, move it!

1082
01:32:43,846 --> 01:32:45,014
Thanks for the help.

1083
01:32:45,306 --> 01:32:47,350
-Hi, Daddy!
-Hi, Cindy, honey!

1084
01:32:47,517 --> 01:32:49,561
Merry Christmas...

1085
01:32:50,103 --> 01:32:51,437
...one and all!

1086
01:32:51,563 --> 01:32:52,564
Cindy!

1087
01:32:54,649 --> 01:32:55,650
Mommy!

1088
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,368
All right.

1089
01:33:06,119 --> 01:33:08,496
What do we have here?

1090
01:33:09,372 --> 01:33:11,666
You got me, Officer!

1091
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:14,085
l did it!

1092
01:33:14,168 --> 01:33:16,838
l'm the Grinch that stole Christmas.

1093
01:33:18,381 --> 01:33:19,716
And l'm...

1094
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,634
...sorry.

1095
01:33:26,514 --> 01:33:28,224
Aren't you gonna cuff me?

1096
01:33:28,349 --> 01:33:31,853
Put me in a choke hold?
Blind me with pepper spray?

1097
01:33:31,978 --> 01:33:33,938
You heard him, Officer. He admitted it.

1098
01:33:34,898 --> 01:33:38,484
-l'd go with the pepper spray.
-Yes, l heard him, all right.

1099
01:33:39,736 --> 01:33:42,196
He said he was sorry.

1100
01:33:43,323 --> 01:33:46,993
Besides, it looks like everything
is all here and accounted for.

1101
01:33:47,368 --> 01:33:49,162
Help me out here, people.

1102
01:33:49,871 --> 01:33:50,872
Martha?

1103
01:33:50,955 --> 01:33:53,333
Merry Christmas, August May-Who!

1104
01:33:54,918 --> 01:33:58,254
l'm afraid l do have something for you!

1105
01:34:09,265 --> 01:34:10,767
Your ring back.

1106
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:12,435
Sorry...

1107
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:15,021
...but my heart belongs to...

1108
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:17,232
...someone else.

1109
01:34:33,331 --> 01:34:35,291
No hard feelings?

1110
01:34:42,549 --> 01:34:43,967
Cheer up, dude. lt's Christmas.

1111
01:34:58,815 --> 01:35:00,942
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.

1112
01:35:05,863 --> 01:35:07,115
Your cheek is so....

1113
01:35:07,657 --> 01:35:08,741
l know.

1114
01:35:09,868 --> 01:35:10,869
Hairy?

1115
01:35:11,619 --> 01:35:13,496
-No.
-Greasy?

1116
01:35:14,414 --> 01:35:16,374
Stinky? Do l have a zit?

1117
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:17,917
No.

1118
01:35:19,586 --> 01:35:21,170
Warm.

1119
01:35:27,844 --> 01:35:32,891
''Fah who foraze, dah who doraze

1120

So he brought back the toys
and the food for the feast.

1135
01:36:38,498 --> 01:36:41,251
And he, he himself, the Grinch...

1136
01:36:41,793 --> 01:36:43,586
...carved the roast beast.

1137
01:36:43,795 --> 01:36:45,129
Yeah!

1138
01:36:59,811 --> 01:37:01,437
There's nothin' like the holidays.

-Who wants the gizzard?
-l do!
