Juice by Tappy! Juice by Tappy!
Juice by Tappy!

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,175
ohhh, Tappy's got juice!
Tappy's got juice!

3
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,340
Whoa, Tappy!

4
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,675
Juice! Juice! Juice!

5
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:33,940
Juice by you! Juice by you!

6
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:38,875
Juice! Juice by you!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

7
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:41,840
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,475
- I said, we got a winner.
- We got a winner!

9
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,540
We got a winner!

10
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:49,675
She's a flight attendant
from Washington, DC.

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,140
Please welcome Mary Kellington.

12
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:56,175
Juice by Mary!
Juice by Mary! Whoa...

13
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:59,540
Harold, please, not again the TV.

14
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:03,675
Ma! Come on, Ma! Why do you have
to make a big deal outta this?

15
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:07,275
You know you'll get the set back
in a couple of hours.

16
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:11,875
Why you gotta make me
feel so guilty, Ma?!

17
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:21,240
Jesus! What are you doing?

18
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:25,275
Trying to get me to break
my own mother's set? Or radiator?

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,540
And maybe blow up the house?

20
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:32,275
Your own flesh and blood! Is that
what you're trying to do? Your son?

21
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:38,075
Why you play games with my head,
for Christ's sake?

22
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:40,375
Harold, I wouldn't do that.

23
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:45,275
The chain isn't for you.
It's for the robbers.

24
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,375
Then why won't you come out?

25
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,675
See what I mean?
See how you always upset me, Ma?

26
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,375
Christ's sake.

27
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,875
Ma?

28
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:15,175
Ma!

29
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:20,575
Come on out. Please, Ma?

30
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,275
Ah, screw it!

31
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,040
This isn't happening.

32
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:32,975
And if it should be happening,
it would be all right.

33
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:37,475
So don't worry, Seymour.
It'll all work out.

34
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:41,475
You'll see already.
In the end, it's all nice.

35
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:51,575
Shit, man. That motherfucker's
starting to look a little seedy.

36
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,675
You particular all of a sudden?

37
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,175
I don't care,
just as long as we get our bread.

38
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,975
Just give me a hand, Tyrone.

39
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:05,275
look at that.

40
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,175
- Hello.
- Hi.

41
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:17,940
Fuck, the table too!

42
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:21,775
What do you want?
You want me to schlep it on my back?

43
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,540
- You got a friend.
- I ain't my leper's schlepper.

44
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,875
Such a son. Your mother needs you
like a moose needs a hat rack.

45
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,940
Shit, man.

46
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,775
This is some boss scag, baby.

47
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:06,075
- I mean, dynamite.
- Oh, man, it's something else.

48
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,675
You know what we need to do?

49
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:20,175
We need to get us a piece of this
Brody shit, cut it up and off it!

50
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,675
We could double our money... easy.

51
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:26,175
Buy some pieces
and we got some whole other shit.

52
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,075
That'd be righteous.

53
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:33,875
I'll bet in no time we'd get a pound
of pure straight from Sal the Geep.

54
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,140
oooh!

55
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:38,675
That's what I'm talking about,
baby - no hassles.

56
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,275
- How's it goin'?
- What's up, buddy?

57
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,675
- The usual?.
- Yeah, sounds good.

58
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,075
Anything else? Huh?

59
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:29,125
- Anything else?
- Ah, no.

60
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,975
Nothing. I'm all right.

61
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:43,975
- Good afternoon, Mrs Goldfarb.
- Good afternoon, Mr Rabinowitz.

62
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:47,075
Although I'm not so sure
how good it is. And you?

63
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,075
- What can I say? You want your TV?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

64
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:55,175
Mrs Goldfarb,
can I ask you a question?

65
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,075
You won't take it personal?.

66
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:01,575
How many years we know each other?
Who's to count?

67
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:05,375
Why not tell the police?
Maybe they could talk to Harry.

68
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:09,975
- He wouldn't be stealing the TV.
- I couldn't do that.

69
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:14,175
Harry's my only child.
He's all I have.

70
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:16,975
Thank you, Mr Rabinowitz.

00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:44,775

- 'Juice it up.'

'Hello? Who is it?'

80
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:34,175
Aw, shit. Now what?

81
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:58,940
Hello?

82
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:02,140
- 'Mrs Sara Goldfarb?'
- Me. Speaking.

83
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:04,940
This is lyle Russell
from Maylin and Block.

84
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:09,125
- I'm not interested.
- 'Wait. I'm not selling anything.

'I just want to offer you
a chance to be on television.'

86
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,775
Television?

87
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,325
'That's right,
Mrs Goldfarb. Congratulations!'

88
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,775
- look, I don't have any...
- 'I don't want money.

93
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:36,540
- Ohh...
- 'Yes, Mrs Goldfarb.'

94
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:40,075
I never thought I'd be
on television. I'm just...

95
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,375
'That's right. You, on television.

98
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:59,475
But I don't get it.
Why are you so hard on your folks?

99
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,840
I mean, they give you everything.

100
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:05,675
They hook you up with an apartment,
a croaker shrink.

101
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:09,640
Which is fine, you know.
It's great. It's just...

102
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:13,475
money is never what I really
wanted from them, you know?

103
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,675
That's pretty much
all they have to give.

104
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:20,475
Why don't you
get away from 'em?

105
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:24,475
- How am I gonna do that?
- I don't know.

106
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,575
What about your clothes?

107
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:30,275
Your sketches are great.
Open up a store.

108
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,775
- I can't.
- Why not?

109
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,475
When will I have time
to hang with you?

110
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:54,375
- Well! So where's the party?
- When I tell you, you're gonna die.

111
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,375
This is a tough one.

112
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,775
I got a great diet book.

113
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,375
Hey.

114
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:24,075
They're coming.

'Be excited! Be, be excited!'

116
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:02,075
I thought I'd catch
a little sun today.

117
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:04,940
Really?
Well, in a box you'll catch it.

118
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:10,275
Just relax and think how gorgeous
you'll look with your new red hair.

119
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,475
Today the hair, tomorrow the sun.

120
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,675
Anybody wanna waste some time?

121
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:23,940
'Angel says do it now.'

122
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:27,275
'I'll call Brody.'
'Brody?'

123
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,640
'He gets unbelievable shit.'
'Righteous.'

124
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:35,575
'look, we got this idea.'
'What is it?'

125
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:39,675
'Get a piece of stuff,
cut it up and double our money.'

126
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,875
'Then get a pound
of pure and retire.

127
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,975
'You know what that means.'

128
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:48,675
'We get off hard knocks
and on easy street.'

129
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:51,675
What's the catch?

130
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:54,840
That's a red. I mean, that's a red.

131
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,975
It's not a red red,
but that's a red. It's a red.

132
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,075
- Red?
- Yeah. It's a red.

133
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:04,275
- You're telling me that's red?
- Yeah.

134
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,175
Then what's orange?

135
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:09,475
If this is a red,
I want to know - what's orange?

136
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:15,975
Well, it could be...

137
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:20,675
that it's a little orange too.

138
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:25,175
You know something?

139
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:36,275
I always thought you were the most
beautiful girl I ever seen.

140
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,375
Really?

141
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:45,475
Ever since I first saw you.

142
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,675
That's nice, Harry.

143
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,875
That makes me feel really good.

144
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:02,975
Other people
have told me that before,

145
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,575
and it was meaningless.

146
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:18,275
Why? Because you thought
they were pulling your leg?

147
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,775
No, no, not like that. I mean...

148
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,475
I don't know. I don't know
or even care if they were.

149
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,775
Just from them it was...

150
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,475
just meaningless, you know?

151
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:38,075
When you say it, I hear it.

152
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,175
I really hear it.

153
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:52,875
Somebody like you could really
make things all right for me.

154
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,875
You think?

155
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:59,475
What is it?

156
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:02,775
Remember when I told you
about the store?

157
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,240
Yeah.

158
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,225
I've been thinking about it and...

159
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,175
I put together some numbers and...

160
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:12,275
and it's not impossible!

161
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,075
I mean, you know, you could do it.

162
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,975
You should do it!

163
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:20,975
I mean, we could do it together.

164
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,775
What do you think?

165
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,840
Stop already.

166
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,675
You'll feel better in the red dress
than in the cheese Danish.

167
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:19,975
'Three things changed my life.
Three.'

168
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,675
'Number one!
No red meat!'

169
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:25,840
'Think about it.
What do they stick in red meat?

170
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:30,375
'I ate red meat to the point where
I would eat it...right off, raw.

171
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:32,775
'I loved my meat!
I turned it around.

172
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,575
'You need to be committed.
You need to be passionate.

173
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,075
'No red meat for 30 days.
No red meat!

174
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:44,275
'Three things is all I did
to change my life. Three things.'

175
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:57,275
Ada told us. It's gorgeous.

176
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,975
We're gonna make it darker.

177
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:02,275
- Why?
- To go with my red dress.

178
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,340
- But it's looking like Madonna.
- It's not.

179
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,675
And neither is this.
But soon - I'm going on a diet.

180
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,340
- What diet?
- Eggs and grapefruit.

181
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,375
- I was on that. lots of luck.
- It's not so bad.

182
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,840
- How long you been on it?
- All day.

183
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:21,075
All day! It's one o'clock!

184
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:24,125
- Thinking thin.
- She's thinking thin.

185
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,075
My louise, she lost 50lbs
just like that.

186
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:28,975
- like what?
- Poof!

187
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:32,275
Did you put her in a sweatbox?

188
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:37,325
She went to a doctor. He gave
her pills. You don't want to eat.

189
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,275
So? You mean, I'm sitting here
not thinking about pastrami on rye?

190
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,642
Don't talk like that
when someone's on a diet.

191
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:48,975
Big deal. I'll sneak
another wedge of grapefruit.

192
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:54,640
- I'm thinking thin!
- Ooh, Sara, the mailman.

193
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:59,975
Sara Goldfarb? You have something
for me? I'm expecting something.

194
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,275
Goldfarb, Goldfarb. Sara Goldfarb.

195
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,775
- Is that it?
- That's it!

196
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,075
- Come on.
- I gotta get my stuff.

197
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,275
- All right.
- I can tell you.

198
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,475
Your name. Put your name.

199
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,292
S-A-R-A G-O-l-D...

200
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:18,451
F-A-R-B!

201
00:22:18,486 --> 00:22:20,575
Dynamite?

202
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:22,975
It's dynamite.

203
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:26,940
A-ha! Dynamite!

204
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:29,475
All right, we on our way.

205
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:32,975
- Brody's man says it's fine shit.
- All right, man.

206
00:22:34,075 --> 00:22:36,775
- Here we go.
- Hey, Ty?

207
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:42,075
- let's do this right, man.
- Come on, baby. Naturally.

208
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:50,675
- Hurry, hurry. let's hurry.
- I wonder when you'll hear.

209
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:53,775
- Hi!
- I wanna come with you!

210
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:58,575
Maybe they'll send you to the
Tavern On The Green with the stars.

211
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:02,040
Yeah, eggs and grapefruit
at Tavern On The Green.

212
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:06,175
- I hope they have that.
- Hurry before the mailman comes.

213
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,075
- Here we are.
- Mail it!

214
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:10,575
Oh, Sara!

215
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:25,775
- There it is, Jim.
- Huh?

216
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:30,975
- There it is, baby.
- Oh, shit!

217
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:35,275
- Shall we try it?
- Wait, Ty.

218
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:40,275
look, this is our chance
to make it big.

219
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:45,375
We play it right,
we can get a pound of pure.

220
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:48,240
But if we get wasted...

221
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:51,775
- we'll fuck it up.
- Right on.

222
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:55,475
Hey, look, I ain't trying
to jive you, Jim.

223
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:58,975
I don't wanna be runnin'
the streets my whole life,

224
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,140
my nose runnin' down to my chin.

225
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:05,475
All I'm sayin' is take a little
taste so we know how much to cut.

226
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,875
It's business.

227
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,075
Yeah, fair enough.

228
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:20,875
Shit...

229
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:39,475
'Thank you!
Three things is all I did.

230
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,440
'30 days is all it takes.

231
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:44,675
'Number two! No refined sugar!

232
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,140
'Now, sugar's everywhere.

233
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:50,375
'You know they even put sugar
in bottled water?

234
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:53,475
'I was sick with sugar!
That was my medicine.

235
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:57,475
'It nurtured my spiralling brain
that felt I was a loser.'

236
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,075
'Juice by you!'

237
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:03,840
'Rule two is no refined sugar.

238
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,175
'Sodas? Don't even
think about sodas any more.

239
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:11,175
'No sucking candies. None of that.
Just stay away from it.

240
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,475
'No refined sugar. For 30 days.'

241
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,375
'I'm gonna eat right.

242
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:21,175
'I am gonna pick up my spirits
and I am gonna try!

243
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:26,075
'I found hope.
And in that hope, I found a way...'

244
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:36,475
Shut up!

245
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:11,840
'Hello?'

246
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,475
- Rosie?
- 'Yeah.'

247
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,075
- Sara.
- 'Yeah?'

248
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,375
I need the number
of that doctor.

249
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:22,540
I don't understand
why you gotta see him.

250
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:25,740
Cut the son of a bitch loose,
for Christ's sake.

251
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:30,175
Because he'll tell my parents
that I've stopped therapy.

252
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,375
They're already thinking
of cutting me off.

253
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:36,775
Harry, I'm not gonna sleep with him.

254
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:39,975
I'm gonna come home
after the concert.

255
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,375
You're jealous!

256
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:45,775
Harry - jealous?

257
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:50,540
- Put your arms around me.
- No.

258
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:53,775
You are so stubborn!
Put your arms around me.

259
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,875
Stop that!

260
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:01,575
- I'll suck your eyeballs out.
- Mm-hm.

261
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:04,075
Well...

262
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:07,575
I'm disappointed
that you're indisposed.

263
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:12,175
Is Anita out of town or something?

264
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,140
Why do you ask?

265
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:18,675
I was just wondering
if she was "indisposed".

266
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:24,775
No.

267
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:29,075
She's fine, thank you.
Actually, she's in Florida.

268
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,275
- Can I ask you something, Arnold?
- Of course.

269
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:38,740
Anything. What?

270
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:41,575
- You just have something here.
- Gone?

271
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,375
A little bit, a little bit lower.

272
00:28:44,475 --> 00:28:47,075
It's OK. Don't worry.
It's much better.

273
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,575
Arnold!

274
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,575
How are you, Mrs Goldfarb?

275
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:57,475
How am I? Enormous.
That's why I'm here.

276
00:28:57,575 --> 00:29:00,475
- I've seen much worse.
- Oh...thank you.

277
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:05,075
- How's your hearing and vision?
- I have both.

278
00:29:06,175 --> 00:29:08,675
The doctor will be with you shortly.

279
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:19,375
- You're a little overweight.
- A little?

280
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:22,225
I have 50lbs
I'm willing to donate.

281
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,975
We can take care of that.
No problem.

282
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:17,475
We're on our way, baby.

283
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,875
We are on our way!

284
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:23,975
God, It was great out there.
I mean, everybody is thirsty.

285
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,940
Come to me.

286
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:30,475
Harry! I am so glad.

287
00:30:36,175 --> 00:30:38,075
Naturally.

288
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:43,575
Naturally.

289
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:50,775
Naturally.

290
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:16,675
Purple in the morning.

291
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,625
Blue in the afternoon.

292
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,475
orange in the evening.

293
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:25,075
There's my three meals,
Mr Smarty-pants.

294
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,775
And green at night. Just like that.

295
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,575
one, two, three, four.

296
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:44,040
Come back to bed, baby.

297
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:47,375
Come on now, Alice.
Got plenty of time for that.

298
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:50,975
Right now I'm grooving
with these new mirrors I got.

299
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,075
oooh!

300
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:15,075
I told ya, Mom,
one day I'd make it.

301
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:17,975
You don't have to make anything,
my sweet.

302
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:20,575
You just have
to love your mama, huh?

303
00:33:20,675 --> 00:33:22,775
What ya doin', baby?

304
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,340
Huh?

305
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,475
- What ya doin', baby?
- Nothin'.

306
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,175
Just thinkin' about you.

307
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,875
About the nasty things
I'm about to do to ya.

308
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,375
Bitch, get over here!

309
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:45,075
Ty, you scare me to death.

310
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:49,975
No, I wouldn't scare you.
I don't wanna scare nobody.

311
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:56,775
All I want out of life is a bit
of peace and happiness. That's all.

312
00:33:57,675 --> 00:33:59,475
Right now...

313
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:04,875
you're the finest fox
I ever laid my eyes on.

314
00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:09,740
That's what I'll do.
Hmm?

315
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:14,475
For my mother. I've been thinking
about getting something for her.

316
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:16,740
like...a present or something.

317
00:34:16,775 --> 00:34:20,075
But I didn't know
what I was gonna get, until now.

318
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,875
- And?
- I finally asked myself, right,

319
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,192
what's her fix?

320
00:34:25,227 --> 00:34:27,440
Television, right?

321
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:30,575
If ever there's a TV junkie,
it's the old lady.

322
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:33,975
I owe her a new set,
with all the wear and tear it got

323
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:37,275
being schlepped
back and forth to old Abe's.

324
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,475
You really love her, don't you?

325
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:44,475
I-I guess so. You know?

326
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:50,775
Most of the time
I just want her to be happy.

327
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:53,725
let's go get it now.

328
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,575
let's push off first.

329
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:03,375
It's early, Harry. We shouldn't
get going till tonight.

330
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,375
'Be excited. Be, be excited.

331
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:56,475
'Be excited. Be, be excited.

332
00:35:56,575 --> 00:35:58,140
'Be excited.

333
00:35:58,175 --> 00:36:00,640
'Be committed and be passionate.'

334
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:06,375
'I am a living testament.
65lbs thinner. I feel great!

335
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:18,175
'Number three. Ohhh, number three!

336
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:22,875
'This drives most people crazy.

337
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,775
'This is easy so far.'

338
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:26,540
- That is thin!
- She's not the same person.

339
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:31,175
I can almost zip the red dress.
I've almost got the zipper up.

340
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:33,140
- The mailman!
- Oh!

341
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:35,475
When I see it
I'll wave it all over.

342
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:38,240
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

343
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:41,975
- What did he say?
- Don't worry, Sara, it'll come.

344
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:45,575
Yeah, don't worry. It'll come.

345
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:48,925
It's Harry!

346
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,375
Harry, oh!

347
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:55,075
Hey, Ma, easy.
You'll crush me, for Christ sakes.

348
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,240
- Come inside.
- Hello.

349
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,775
Hi, Harry! Hello!
We'll have a little visit.

350
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,892
So, how are you, Harry?
You look so good.

351
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,940
- You want something to eat?
- No, Ma.

352
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:11,275
A little nosh, a piece of cake?
I could go and get something.

353
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,775
I don't have anything in the house,
but Ada would.

354
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,275
A cupcake?
You want something to eat?

355
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,340
No, no, Ma, nothing. Please, sit.

356
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,340
You're making me dizzy,
for Christ's sake.

357
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,975
You notice anything, huh?
You notice I'm slimmer?

358
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:29,040
Yeah, I guess you are.

359
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:32,575
25lbs, I lost. 25lbs!
Can you believe it?

360
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:36,275
- And that's only the beginning.
- That's great, Ma.

361
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:39,875
I'm really happy for you.
But will you sit? Please.

362
00:38:42,675 --> 00:38:48,175
I'm sorry I haven't been around
in a while, Ma, but I've been busy.

363
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:51,175
Yeah? You got a good job?
You're doing well?.

364
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:54,475
- Yeah, good, real good.
- What kind of business?

365
00:38:54,575 --> 00:38:59,175
Well, I'm sort of a distributor
like, for a big importer.

366
00:38:59,275 --> 00:39:04,075
- Ohh! I'm so happy for you!
- Ma... Easy. You're killin' me.

367
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,875
Jesus, what,
you been lifting weights?

368
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:09,740
- I knew you could do that.
- You were right.

369
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:13,075
Now maybe you'll meet
a nice girl and have a baby?

370
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:16,875
Well, I already met one.

371
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:19,540
Ma, don't go ape shit.

372
00:39:19,575 --> 00:39:23,275
- Who is she? Who's her parents?
- You know her.

373
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,975
- Marion? Marion Silver. Remember?
- Oh, Silver!

374
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,040
of course. Manhattan Beach.

375
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:33,275
House on the esplanade.
Garment business.

376
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,475
He's big in women's undies.

377
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:40,475
Before you go bouncing all over
again and make me forget, just...

378
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:45,275
What I wanna tell you
is that I got you a present.

379
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,475
I don't need a present.
Just have a baby.

380
00:39:48,575 --> 00:39:52,175
Will you let me tell you
what I got ya? Will ya, Ma?

381
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:57,675
Christ, you are really something
else today, you know that?

382
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,275
look, I know...

383
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,175
Well...

384
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:09,575
I'm sorry for being such a bastard.
I wanna make it up.

385
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:13,475
I mean, I know I can't change
anything that's happened,

386
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,940
but I want you to know that...

387
00:40:15,975 --> 00:40:19,875
That I love ya, and that I'm sorry.

388
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:25,075
And I want you to be happy.
So I got you a brand-new TV set.

389
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:29,375
It's gonna be delivered in a
couple of days. It's from Macy's!

390
00:40:29,475 --> 00:40:31,175
oh, Harry!

391
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,840
Your father'd be so happy

392
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:39,375
if he could see
what you're doing for your mother.

393
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,840
See that, Seymour?

394
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,040
You see how good your son is?

395
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:52,275
He knows what it's like
for his mother living all alone.

396
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,475
No one to visit her.

397
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:07,675
Hey, Ma.

398
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:10,340
- You on uppers?
- What?

399
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:14,275
You're on uppers.
You're on diet pills, ain't you?

400
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,875
I told you.
I'm going to a specialist.

401
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,375
That's what I thought!
You're on speed, ain't ya?

402
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,740
Harry, I'm goin' to a doctor.

403
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:26,225
- Does he give you pills?
- Of course. He's a doctor.

404
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,675
- What kind of pills?
- A purple, a blue, an orange...

405
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,640
I mean, like what's in 'em?

406
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:36,575
Oh, Harry, I'm Sara Goldfarb, not
Albert Einstein. How should I know?

407
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:39,675
Does it make you feel good
and give you pep?

408
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,375
Well... yeah, a little.

409
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:45,075
Ma, I can hear ya
grinding your teeth.

410
00:41:45,175 --> 00:41:47,575
- That goes away at night.
- At night?

411
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:51,975
Yeah, when I take the green one.
30 minutes I'm asleep. Poof.

412
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,075
Ma, Ma, ya gotta
cut that stuff loose.

413
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,240
I'm tellin' ya, it's no good.

414
00:41:57,275 --> 00:42:00,275
What do you mean it's no good?
25lbs I've lost.

415
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,940
So what? You wanna be a dope fiend?

416
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:07,575
Dope fiend? Am I foaming
at the mouth? He's a nice doctor.

417
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,875
I am telling you, he's no good.

418
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:14,175
How come you know so much? How
come you know more than a doctor?

419
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:19,875
Believe me, Ma, I know. All right?

420
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,040
You'll get strung out.

421
00:42:23,075 --> 00:42:26,175
Ah, come on!
I almost fit in my red dress.

422
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,275
The one I wore
to your high school graduation.

423
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,575
The one your father liked so much.

424
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:35,775
oh, I remember how he looked at me
in that red dress.

425
00:42:37,275 --> 00:42:40,775
Ma, what's the big deal
about the red dress?

426
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:45,175
I'm going to wear it at...

427
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:48,340
You don't know!

428
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:53,175
I'm gonna be on television.
I got a call and an application...

429
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:56,175
Come on, Ma, who's pulling your leg?

430
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,140
No, no, no. I'm tellin' ya.

431
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,375
I'm gonna be a contestant
on television.

432
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:04,075
They haven't told me when yet,

433
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:09,275
but you'll be proud when you see
your mother in her red dress on TV.

434
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:14,575
What is the big deal?. Those pills
will kill you before you get on.

435
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,575
"Big deal?. "

436
00:43:16,675 --> 00:43:18,540
You drove up in a cab.

437
00:43:18,575 --> 00:43:21,575
Did you see who had the best seat?

438
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,275
I'm somebody now, Harry.

439
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,875
Everybody likes me.

440
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,640
Soon...

441
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:32,775
millions of people will see me
and they'll all like me.

442
00:43:33,475 --> 00:43:35,675
I'll tell them about you...

443
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,375
and your father.

444
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:39,875
How good he was to us.

445
00:43:39,975 --> 00:43:41,675
Remember?

446
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,475
It's a reason
to get up in the morning.

447
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:53,375
It's a reason to lose weight,
to fit in the red dress.

448
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:57,075
It's a reason to smile.

449
00:43:58,975 --> 00:44:02,175
It makes tomorrow all right.

450
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,975
What have I got, Harry?

451
00:44:07,675 --> 00:44:09,140
Hmm?

452
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:13,575
Why should I even make the bed
or wash the dishes?

453
00:44:13,675 --> 00:44:17,175
I do them, but why should I?

454
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:20,075
I'm alone.

455
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:24,575
Your father's gone, you're gone.

456
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:29,575
I got no one to...

457
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,475
care for.

458
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:34,475
What have I got, Harry?

459
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:41,175
I'm lonely.

460
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,240
I'm old.

461
00:44:45,275 --> 00:44:47,675
You got friends, Ma.

462
00:44:47,775 --> 00:44:50,075
It's not the same.

463
00:44:51,575 --> 00:44:53,375
They don't need me.

464
00:44:58,575 --> 00:45:00,675
I like the way I feel.

465
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:05,440
I like thinking
about the red dress...

466
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:09,575
and the television
and you and your father.

467
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,775
Now when I get the sun, I smile.

468
00:45:20,975 --> 00:45:22,775
I'll come and visit, Ma.

469
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:28,575
Now that I'm straight, m-my business
is going good, I'll come.

470
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:31,175
Me and Marion,
we'll come for dinner.

471
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,040
Good. You bring her.

472
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:35,875
I'll make you
mushroom soup and a roast.

473
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:40,075
That sounds great, Ma.
That sounds great.

474
00:45:40,175 --> 00:45:44,075
- I'll call ahead, all right?
- OK.

475
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,440
I'm glad.

476
00:45:47,475 --> 00:45:52,475
I'm glad you have a nice girl
and your own business. I'm glad.

477
00:45:58,975 --> 00:46:00,540
I gotta go, Ma.

478
00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:03,975
I got an appointment in Manhattan
in a little bit,

479
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,875
but I'll be back.

480
00:46:05,975 --> 00:46:09,575
- OK, y-you still got your key?
- Yeah, I got it, Ma.

481
00:46:12,075 --> 00:46:13,775
Bye, Son.

482
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,075
Brody says you comin' up quick.

483
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:57,375
oh. Thanks, man.

484
00:47:00,075 --> 00:47:04,175
He says you're smart, you're loyal
and you're not a junkie.

485
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,675
Brody wants to promote you.

486
00:47:09,775 --> 00:47:12,675
Give you more responsibility.
Interested?

487
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:14,675
Yeah, yeah!

488
00:47:14,775 --> 00:47:16,775
Shit, yeah, man.

489
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:23,575
Brody says,
you fuck him, I kill you.

490
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,975
- I got that.
- Remember that.

491
00:47:29,675 --> 00:47:31,775
Shit! You got a white driver!

492
00:47:38,675 --> 00:47:40,575
Fuck!

493
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:45,075
What the fuck?

494
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,075
Don't move!

495
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:32,175
I love you, Harry.

496
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:37,675
You make me feel like a person.

497
00:48:40,275 --> 00:48:43,075
like I'm me...

498
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:46,675
and I'm beautiful.

499
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:50,475
You are beautiful.

500
00:48:54,775 --> 00:48:58,175
You're the most
beautiful girl in the world.

501
00:48:59,775 --> 00:49:01,875
You're my dream.

502
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:11,540
'No, I'm certain.
I've checked again.'

503
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:14,875
But maybe you gave me
a weaker one last time.

504
00:49:14,975 --> 00:49:18,675
'That isn't possible.
They're all the same potency.'

505
00:49:18,775 --> 00:49:20,875
But something isn't the same.

506
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:26,075
'You're becoming adjusted to them.
It's nothing to worry about, OK?'

507
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:46,740
- 'We got a winner!'
- 'We got a winner!'

508
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,175
'She's beautiful,
with a winning sense of humour

509
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,775
'and magical smile.

510
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:55,475
'From Brighton Beach, Brooklyn,
let's welcome

511
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,175
'Mrs Sara Goldfarb!'

512
00:49:57,275 --> 00:50:01,875
'Juice by Sara!
Juice by Sara! Ohh, Sara!

513
00:50:01,975 --> 00:50:06,975
'Sara's got juice!
Sara's got juice! Ohh, Sara!'

514
00:50:15,275 --> 00:50:18,175
love, Tyrone C.

515
00:50:18,275 --> 00:50:20,875
Get your shit together.
You made bail.

516
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:22,575
How much?

517
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:26,075
Most of our cash.
You're up for consortin'.

518
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,975
oh, shit, man!

519
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:31,940
Angel says there's a war
between the Italians and Blacks.

520
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:36,275
Sal the Geep is keeping the shit
in Florida until Brody's gone.

521
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,340
Shit.

522
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:40,375
- No one's got a thing.
- Except Big Tim.

523
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,340
Shit. let's go see him.

524
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:45,275
He only givin' up for pussy.

525
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,875
What?

526
00:50:46,975 --> 00:50:49,675
Pussy. He's hooked on it, man.

527
00:50:49,775 --> 00:50:53,375
I'd give him all he wants.
He said I ain't cute enough.

528
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:08,240
'Come on, number three!

529
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:12,275
'This drives most people crazy.

530
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:14,275
'They're not gonna like it.

531
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:17,975
'This is easy so far!
Give it up for 30 days, it will...'

532
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,275
You all right?

533
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:38,475
Yeah. It was just a bad dream.

534
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,575
Want some water?

535
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:05,175
Maybe we should dip in now.

536
00:52:05,275 --> 00:52:08,075
Come on! I already told you,
all right?

537
00:52:10,075 --> 00:52:11,940
It's all we have.

538
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:15,075
Tyrone is gonna score
in the morning, Harry.

539
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:22,575
I don't know, it's...

540
00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:24,475
it's a bitch out there.

541
00:52:26,475 --> 00:52:28,475
It'll be OK.

542
00:52:30,475 --> 00:52:32,375
It'll be OK, Harry.

543
00:52:36,575 --> 00:52:38,675
Yeah...

544
00:52:38,775 --> 00:52:40,575
I guess so.

545
00:52:47,475 --> 00:52:49,675
I love you, Harry.

546
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:32,175
What's
the problem? The weight's fine.

547
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,575
The weight's fine, I'm not.

548
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:37,775
The refrigerator...

549
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:41,275
Something wrong?

550
00:53:43,475 --> 00:53:45,275
Everything's...

551
00:53:49,675 --> 00:53:51,675
all mixed up.

552
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:54,375
- Confused...
- Nothing to worry about.

553
00:53:54,475 --> 00:53:57,675
Get this filled.
Make an appointment for a week.

554
00:54:06,975 --> 00:54:08,375
Well?.

555
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:11,775
Ty ain't found nothin' yet.

556
00:54:13,675 --> 00:54:15,575
What are we gonna do?

557
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:17,540
I don't know.

558
00:54:17,575 --> 00:54:20,275
Well, you have
to do something, Harry.

559
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:23,625
It's your fault
we don't have anything.

560
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,840
- What?
- You were all hot last night.

561
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:30,825
- That is such bullshit!
- We could've had something...

562
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,775
Was I supposed to watch you
push off and not go myself?

563
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,875
Don't put it all on me, OK?

564
00:54:48,075 --> 00:54:51,375
Don't worry, man.
We'll fill it up again.

565
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,275
Things'll get better,

566
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:57,975
then we'll be fillin'
the box back up, you know?

567
00:55:04,775 --> 00:55:07,775
So,
you wanna hear the news?

568
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,640
What news?

569
00:55:09,675 --> 00:55:13,375
You got your good news,
you got your bad news.

570
00:55:13,475 --> 00:55:15,140
Shoot.

571
00:55:15,175 --> 00:55:17,040
Good news is,

572
00:55:17,075 --> 00:55:20,075
there's gonna be
some prime on the street.

573
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:23,675
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

574
00:55:23,775 --> 00:55:25,875
Who told you that?

575
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,075
- Angel.
- Yeah?

576
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:33,675
Sal the Geep sent word to let
a couple of keys go for Christmas,

577
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:35,840
him being a good Christian and all,

578
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:38,975
not wantin' bad feelin'
during the season.

579
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,575
- You believe it?
- Well, I did...

580
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:43,675
till I heard the bad news.

581
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:51,240
Yeah?

582
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:54,175
Price is double.
You have to cop for weight.

583
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:57,575
- At least a half a piece.
- How much?

584
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,775
- Two.
- Two?

585
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:03,975
- That's fuckin' insane!
- What you gonna do?

586
00:56:04,075 --> 00:56:06,575
Man ain't gonna
lay no nickel bag on ya.

587
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,475
Where we gonna get two?

588
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,640
You mean Arnold?

589
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:14,675
Well, your parents
won't even return your call.

590
00:56:15,975 --> 00:56:17,975
I haven't seen him in months.

591
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:22,075
- So? He's still callin', ain't he?
- I don't know.

592
00:56:23,575 --> 00:56:26,375
look, I don't know what else to do.

593
00:56:26,475 --> 00:56:29,240
It's our last chance
to get back on track!

594
00:56:29,275 --> 00:56:32,975
We won't have to make
the freezing scene every day!

595
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:37,140
We need the bread.

596
00:56:37,175 --> 00:56:40,775
Getting the money
is not the problem, Harry.

597
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,975
What is the problem?

598
00:56:43,075 --> 00:56:46,075
I don't know
what I'll have to do to get it.

599
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:54,725
look...

600
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,375
Baby...

601
00:56:58,075 --> 00:57:00,575
we'll be back in business
in no time.

602
00:57:01,675 --> 00:57:03,875
We'll start movin' again,

603
00:57:03,975 --> 00:57:06,175
and we'll start savin'.

604
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:12,375
It'll be perfect, just like it was.
I promise, Marion.

605
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:17,775
You'll see.

606
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:31,875
No, I've just, uh...I've had this
flu forever, it seems like.

607
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:36,875
- Are you depressed?
- No, it's nothing like that.

608
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,575
I've been, uh...
I've been really busy.

609
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:43,375
Actually,
I've been designing...non-stop.

610
00:57:43,475 --> 00:57:47,075
Wonderful.
Glad to hear you've been productive.

611
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,740
To be perfectly frank,

612
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:56,675
I was a little surprised
to hear from you.

613
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:04,175
- Is there something wrong?
- No. Why?

614
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:09,675
Well, it's usually the case...
from someone you haven't heard from.

615
00:58:10,475 --> 00:58:12,375
Everything's fine.

616
00:58:16,175 --> 00:58:17,975
Actually,

617
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:24,075
I have a favour to ask.

618
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:32,475
You smug fuck!

619
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,975
What is it?

620
00:58:40,175 --> 00:58:42,225
I need some money.

621
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,275
May I ask what for?

622
00:58:46,075 --> 00:58:50,275
- Could you turn the light off?
- Why do you want the light off?

623
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:52,175
I just do.

624
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:56,075
- You never did before.
- Please, Arnold.

625
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,075
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, man.

626
01:02:28,175 --> 01:02:31,375
All Angel said
was meet at Waldbaum's.

627
01:02:34,475 --> 01:02:38,175
- Is this the right Waldbaum's?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

628
01:02:39,475 --> 01:02:42,975
You just watch my back,
and I'll watch yours.

629
01:02:46,575 --> 01:02:49,275
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Hey.

630
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:04,075
Everyone and their mother.

631
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08,275
The truck's gonna be here.
Back up.

632
01:03:11,075 --> 01:03:12,475
Back up.

633
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:37,975
Come back!

634
01:04:40,575 --> 01:04:44,875
Stupid fuckin' junkie!
We're fucked! We are fucked.

635
01:04:44,975 --> 01:04:47,075
Sitting in that hot-ass sun

636
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,575
while we sit here ass deep
in motherfuckin' snow.

637
01:04:54,275 --> 01:04:56,175
What if we went down there?

638
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:58,625
- Are you serious?
- Why not?

639
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,975
What the fuck are you sayin'?

640
01:05:01,075 --> 01:05:05,375
We ask some room clerk at some hotel
for a connection?

641
01:05:05,475 --> 01:05:09,375
You saying you can't nose out
some dope when it's around?

642
01:05:09,475 --> 01:05:12,340
Man, we got nothin' to lose.
It's wide open.

643
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:16,475
And if we get there right away
we can name our own price,

644
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:19,675
and have those fools
cover the street for us.

645
01:05:21,975 --> 01:05:26,675
Yeah, man. last summer was
a motherfuckin' ball, huh, Jim?

646
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:35,075
Just seems like a thousand years ago
since last summer, man.

647
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,275
It'll be like that again, man.

648
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,775
I could get Angel
to get us a short...

649
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:46,675
if we promise him
some dynamite scag.

650
01:07:04,175 --> 01:07:06,725
Thank God. Where have you been?

651
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,275
Where the hell you think I've been?

652
01:07:10,075 --> 01:07:13,275
- Where's the score?
- We had a bit of a problem.

653
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:17,275
I mean, everything was goin' good,
and then...

654
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:19,840
- some dumb-ass junkie...
- Did what?

655
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:23,275
Some dumb-ass junkie did what?!
You fucked up?!

656
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:27,675
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- You promised it was gonna be OK.

657
01:07:27,775 --> 01:07:31,675
I fucked that sleaze-bag.
I put myself through hell for you!

658
01:07:31,775 --> 01:07:36,475
- There's nothing out there!
- I don't give a shit! Fucking loser!

659
01:07:39,175 --> 01:07:41,575
You wanna be sure
we have some extra?

660
01:07:41,675 --> 01:07:44,575
Ty told me about a guy
holding some weight.

661
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:46,875
But he ain't sellin' it!

662
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:48,875
'Yeah?'

663
01:07:48,975 --> 01:07:51,575
- Gimme that guy's number.
- 'What guy?'

664
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:54,175
- The guy who likes broads!
- 'Why?'

665
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:56,175
Just gimme the number!

666
01:07:56,275 --> 01:08:00,075
'All right. 934-8777.'

667
01:08:01,775 --> 01:08:05,375
You worried so much,
go fix yourself up with him!

668
01:08:05,475 --> 01:08:10,175
You won't have to fuckin' wait
and I won't freeze my ass off!

669
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:12,075
Fuck you.

670
01:08:46,275 --> 01:08:48,640
'All right, we got a winner.'

671
01:08:48,675 --> 01:08:51,575
- 'We got a winner.'
- 'We got a winner.'

672
01:08:51,675 --> 01:08:54,275
- 'We got a winner.'
- 'We got a winner.'

673
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:58,275
'She's beautiful, with a winning
sense of humour and smile.

674
01:08:58,310 --> 01:08:59,875
'She'll win your heart!

675

to our own Mrs Sara Goldfarb!'

677
01:09:07,775 --> 01:09:12,575
'Juice by Sara!
Juice by Sara! Ohh, Sara!'

678
01:09:14,475 --> 01:09:16,275
'Ohh, Sara!'

679
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:19,040
'It's a pleasure
to be here.'

680
01:09:19,075 --> 01:09:23,575
'It's a pleasure to have you.
And that is one smashing dress.'

01:09:43,675 --> 01:09:45,840
'I'm sure he'll be here soon.

686
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:49,775
'It's almost that time.
Are you ready?'

687
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,775
'I'm ready, Tappy.'

688
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:56,675
'Not to worry. Not to worry.'

689

What are you doing here?

Why are you here?

01:10:18,275 --> 01:10:20,940
look at this.

695
01:10:20,975 --> 01:10:24,375
- It's disgusting.
- What do you expect?

696
01:10:24,475 --> 01:10:27,475
Could you do any better?

697
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:29,375
look at this.

698
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:33,475
It's an old building.
It hasn't been painted in years.

699
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:36,175
I'm old! Alone!

700
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:38,575
You don't understand.

701
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,875
Please. I'll explain.

702
01:11:22,075 --> 01:11:24,925
What is that? No, I don't want that!

703
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,775
What are you doing?
Get away from me!

704
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:29,875
- Ready, Mrs Goldfarb.
- What?

705
01:11:29,975 --> 01:11:31,975
Three, two...

706
01:11:32,075 --> 01:11:35,775
What am I supposed to do?

707
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:15,775
Feed me!

708
01:12:23,575 --> 01:12:25,340
Feed him yourself.

709
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:29,840
- Feed me, Sara.
- Feed me, Sara.

710
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:32,875
Feed me, Sara!

711
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:36,775
Feed me, Sara! Feed me, Sara!

I just wanna be on television!
Please!

713
01:13:24,475 --> 01:13:27,075
Thank you, Angel.

714
01:13:27,175 --> 01:13:29,175
Whoo-hoo!

715
01:13:29,275 --> 01:13:34,175
Sure hope this motherfucker works.
My ass could use some heat.

716
01:13:34,275 --> 01:13:38,275
- How long this trip's gonna take?
- We'll make it in a day.

717
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:40,440
A day? Shit!

718
01:13:40,475 --> 01:13:42,825
California, here we come.

719
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,917
It's Florida, Ty. Florida.

720
01:13:44,952 --> 01:13:46,940
California, Florida...

721
01:13:46,975 --> 01:13:49,775
Either way,
your pale ass getting a tan.

722
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,275
Ah!

723
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:56,475
Does this train
go to Madison Avenue?!

724
01:13:56,575 --> 01:13:58,475
Do you know Maylin and Block?

725
01:13:58,575 --> 01:14:01,875
I have their address.
It's on Madison Avenue.

726
01:14:01,975 --> 01:14:05,675
- I'm gonna be on television.
- You're whacked!

727
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,175
Hey! Hey! Hello?

728
01:14:10,275 --> 01:14:14,175
Do you know if this train
goes to Madison Avenue?

729
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:17,075
I'm gonna be on television!

730
01:14:18,575 --> 01:14:21,075
I just have to find out when.

731
01:14:22,675 --> 01:14:24,375
Florida?

732
01:14:27,575 --> 01:14:29,675
When is he gonna be back?

733
01:14:31,275 --> 01:14:35,575
A few days?
Angel, what am I supposed to do?

734
01:14:36,675 --> 01:14:38,775
Please, you gotta help me.

735
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,775
oh, come on, I can get you money.

736
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:46,675
Angel, there's gotta be something.
Anything. Help me.

737
01:14:46,775 --> 01:14:49,440
Why aren't you calling me?

738
01:14:49,475 --> 01:14:53,075
I have to know when
I'm gonna be on television.

739
01:14:54,175 --> 01:14:56,940
I'm Sara Goldfarb.

740
01:14:56,975 --> 01:15:01,175
And you should tell me
when I'm gonna be on television.

741
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,875
Just sit for a moment.
I'll ring them.

742
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,275
I just wanna know when.

743
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:11,775
Maybe you lost my card! Please,
have a look, and you'll tell me.

744
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:16,775
It's not the prizes.
I'll give them away.

745
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,975
I just wanna be on the show.

746
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:21,375
I've waited so long...

747
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:26,175
to be on with my Harry
and my grandson.

748
01:15:26,275 --> 01:15:28,675
Here, Mrs Goldfarb, sip this.

749
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:33,275
Sometimes it takes a while to get
called for a show, Mrs Goldfarb.

750
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:36,775
Oh. Oooh.

751
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,840
- Is this her?
- Yes.

752
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:45,175
- Can you walk?
- I'm walkin' across the stage!

753
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:48,875
And you should see
my Harry on television.

754
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:51,075
We're giving the prizes away.

755
01:15:51,175 --> 01:15:55,075
I just wanted
to be on the show!

756
01:15:56,575 --> 01:16:00,775
- What's her name?
- We think it's Sara Goldfarb.

757
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:04,475
Tell Seymour to meet me
at the beauty parlour.

758
01:16:04,575 --> 01:16:08,575
I've got the red dress that
I wore to Harry's graduation.

759
01:16:08,675 --> 01:16:11,075
oK, Mrs Goldfarb. Here we go.

760
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:13,775
One, two, three...

761
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:16,275
let's take it nice and easy.

762
01:16:39,675 --> 01:16:42,175
'Yeah?'

763
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:07,075
'Yeah?'

764
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:11,675
Hi...

765
01:17:14,775 --> 01:17:18,275
Tell Rose I'm going
to be on television.

766
01:17:35,175 --> 01:17:37,075
Whoo.

767
01:17:46,275 --> 01:17:47,940
oh, shit!

768
01:17:47,975 --> 01:17:50,540
God damn! How long you had that?

769
01:17:50,575 --> 01:17:55,275
- Just a few days.
- That shit don't look too good.

770
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:57,675
It don't feel too good either, man.

771
01:17:58,975 --> 01:18:02,575
But a little stuff
will take care of that.

772
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:04,792
Hey! Don't shoot in there!

773
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:06,975
I'll blow it if I don't.

774
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:09,475
Fuck it.

775
01:18:18,575 --> 01:18:20,175
oh...

776
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:23,475
Shit.

777
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:41,975
- Hi, how are you? Can you hear me?
- Yes, Seymour.

778
01:18:42,075 --> 01:18:45,575
- Take anything?
- I took my red dress and...

779
01:18:45,675 --> 01:18:48,375
- No emergency. Take her to psych.
- Television.

780
01:18:59,475 --> 01:19:01,175
Come on in.

781
01:19:04,075 --> 01:19:05,475
Thanks.

782
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:12,675
What's your name?

783
01:19:14,775 --> 01:19:16,375
Marion.

784
01:19:16,475 --> 01:19:18,375
Well, what do you know?

785
01:19:18,475 --> 01:19:20,375
Maid Marion.

786
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,075
I'm little John.

787
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:33,440
Beautiful view.

788
01:19:33,475 --> 01:19:36,175
You know what I like
about paddy chicks?

789
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:40,075
They give good head.

790
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,875
Black broads
know nothin' about head.

791
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,740
I don't know why.

792
01:19:44,775 --> 01:19:48,475
Maybe it's to do
with some ancient tribal custom.

793
01:19:53,475 --> 01:19:55,575
Come here.

794
01:20:08,175 --> 01:20:11,575
Mmm. Better save
some of that energy.

795
01:20:28,675 --> 01:20:30,975
oh, I know it's pretty, baby,

796
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:33,275
but I didn't take it out for air.

797
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:46,075
Yeah.

798
01:20:50,475 --> 01:20:54,075
I told your ass,
stay away from that arm. See?

799
01:20:55,675 --> 01:20:57,875
I gotta call Marion, man.

800
01:20:57,975 --> 01:21:01,175
That's about to be
a long-distance call now.

801
01:21:01,275 --> 01:21:05,525
That's 600 miles!
We are 600 miles closer to Miami.

802
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,775
It's also 600 miles
further away from New York.

803
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:17,825
I know where to get
a real nice taste,

804
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:20,540
though it's more like play.
Sunday night?

805
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:24,275
We're throwing a little gathering.
All good people.

806
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:26,375
I can't, I'm busy.

807
01:21:26,475 --> 01:21:28,740
Anyway, I'm not really hooked.

808
01:21:28,775 --> 01:21:31,975
Oh, I know,
but it's a real nice taste.

809
01:21:38,475 --> 01:21:40,775
I'll see you Sunday, Maid Marion.

810
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:45,040
OK, just try
and answer my questions.

811
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:49,940
- When did you start taking pills?
- Oh, the summer.

812
01:21:49,975 --> 01:21:54,075
- You started last summer?
- I got the best place in the sun.

813
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:58,075
- Ada fixed my hair.
- Everything is gonna be all right.

814
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,575
We'll get you fixed up in no time.

815
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:24,875
- Hold tight, man.
- I can't fucking cut it.

816
01:22:24,975 --> 01:22:27,075
I gotta do something about my arm.

817
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:29,175
let me see what it looks like.

818
01:22:36,275 --> 01:22:38,675
oh, damn, Jim!

819
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:41,275
oh, man.

820
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:44,040
That's one ugly motherfucker.

821
01:22:44,075 --> 01:22:46,725
- I gotta call Marion.
- Fuck that.

822
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:49,375
We gotta get you to a hospital, man.

823
01:22:54,475 --> 01:22:56,240
What is that?

824
01:22:56,275 --> 01:22:59,975
I don't want that.
I don't want that!

825
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:02,275
Ah! Oh...

826
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:40,440
What's the problem?

827
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:44,575
- It's my arm. My arm is killin' me.
- let's have a look at it.

828
01:23:48,775 --> 01:23:50,275
All right.

829
01:23:54,575 --> 01:23:56,475
I'll be back in a minute.

830
01:24:23,175 --> 01:24:25,375
I wanna play blackjack
all night long.

831
01:24:25,475 --> 01:24:30,375
So I make up this routine. I say,
"you go ahead. I don't feel good."

832
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:32,642
Sure enough, they leave...

833
01:24:32,677 --> 01:24:34,875
Ready? One, two and three.

834
01:24:36,575 --> 01:24:38,740
As soon as they leave,

835
01:24:38,775 --> 01:24:42,275
I go running back to the casino,
sit at my blackjack table.

836
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,375
I am there for the whole night.

837
01:24:44,475 --> 01:24:50,375
Finally, I get up so big, I got
five $100 black chips in my pocket.

838
01:24:50,475 --> 01:24:53,075
I swear to God.
The hours are going by.

839
01:24:53,175 --> 01:24:57,075
I'm laying back, hittin' on
hard 17 s. It was beautiful.

840
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,375
Next thing I know,

841
01:24:59,475 --> 01:25:04,275
this security guard is sitting there
telling me I have to leave.

842
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:07,675
I'm like, "Why you telling me
I have to leave?"

843
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:10,175
He says,
"You have to leave because..."

844
01:25:15,975 --> 01:25:17,575
Swallow.

845
01:25:21,175 --> 01:25:23,975
Swallow.

846
01:25:53,475 --> 01:25:57,275
You have to eat. If we're gonna
get you healthy you have to eat.

847
01:25:57,375 --> 01:26:01,875
Work with the attendants.
I'm gonna try some new medications.

848
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,575
- Hello.
- 'Marion.'

849
01:27:08,175 --> 01:27:09,875
Harry?

850
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:14,975
'Marion, I've been
thinking about you so much.

851
01:27:15,075 --> 01:27:16,975
'Are you OK?'

852
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:23,775
- When you comin' home?
- Soon.

853
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:25,375
When?

854
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:28,375
Soon.

855
01:27:29,475 --> 01:27:32,975
- 'You holdin' out all right?'
- Harry?

856
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,275
Can you come today?

857
01:27:40,975 --> 01:27:43,475
Yeah.

858
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:51,775
I'll come.

859
01:27:51,875 --> 01:27:55,175
'I'll come today.'

860
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:02,975
You just wait for me, all right?

861
01:28:06,175 --> 01:28:09,675
- OK, Harry.
- 'I'm coming back, Marion.'

862
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:11,575
- Yeah.
- 'Marion?'

863
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:13,075
Yeah?

864
01:28:14,175 --> 01:28:16,875
I'm really sorry, Marion.

865
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:18,775
I know.

866
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:29,875
Mrs Goldfarb?

867
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:33,675
You all right?

868
01:28:35,275 --> 01:28:40,975
Um, so, Mrs Goldfarb,
we've tried several medications,

869
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:43,440
and you don't seem to be responding.

870
01:28:43,475 --> 01:28:47,575
I believe we might want to try
some alternative methods.

871
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:51,575
We've had excellent results
with ECT in the past.

872
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:53,875
Um... So if I can just...

873
01:28:53,975 --> 01:28:56,575
get your John Hancock...

874
01:28:57,975 --> 01:28:59,675
we'll get underway.

875
01:28:59,775 --> 01:29:01,275
Great. Thanks.

876
01:29:02,475 --> 01:29:05,225
Oh, Jesus Christ!

877
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:07,975
I need a doctor, man.

878
01:29:08,075 --> 01:29:11,275
My friend is sick.
Give him some help, please.

879
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:14,975
I can't take it, man!
My arm! My fuckin' arm!

880
01:29:16,475 --> 01:29:18,375
Help me!

881
01:29:18,475 --> 01:29:22,875
Help us!
Somebody fuckin' help us, please!

882
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:46,340
Maid Marion. Welcome.

883
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:48,475
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

884
01:29:48,575 --> 01:29:50,240
- Yes, sir.
- OK for work.

885
01:29:50,275 --> 01:29:52,375
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

886
01:29:52,475 --> 01:29:54,840
- Yes, sir.
- OK for work.

887
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:56,975
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

888
01:29:57,075 --> 01:29:59,140
- Yes, sir.
- OK for work.

889
01:29:59,175 --> 01:30:00,975
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

890
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,240
- Yes, sir.
- OK for work.

891
01:30:03,275 --> 01:30:05,175
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?

892
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:07,075
- Yes, sir.
- OK for work.

893
01:30:07,175 --> 01:30:11,240
Fellas, meet Marion.

894
01:30:11,275 --> 01:30:13,740
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

895
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:16,040
- Yes, sir.
- OK for work.

896
01:30:16,075 --> 01:30:18,375
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

897
01:30:18,475 --> 01:30:20,475
- Yes, sir.
- OK for work.

898
01:30:20,575 --> 01:30:22,575
Show time.

899
01:30:23,475 --> 01:30:26,675
OK for work.
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

900
01:30:26,775 --> 01:30:28,575
Yes. Oof!

901
01:30:28,675 --> 01:30:32,475
Say, "sir". Goddam New York
dope fiend niggers.

902
01:30:32,575 --> 01:30:34,575
learn some manners.

903
01:30:34,675 --> 01:30:36,875
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

904
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:39,740
- Yes, sir.
- OK for work.

905
01:30:39,775 --> 01:30:43,075
- Got a mouthpiece.
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?

906
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:45,975
Says something's wrong
with his arm.

907
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:50,275
He won't be puttin'
any more dope in that.

908
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,740
- Smells worse than he do.
- Test.

909
01:30:52,775 --> 01:30:55,775
Get him
over to hospital.

910
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:58,775
Ready? And...one.

911
01:31:22,675 --> 01:31:25,475
That's the trouble
with you dope fiends.

912
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:27,875
You got a rotten attitude. You know?

913
01:31:28,675 --> 01:31:32,075
- So what are we gonna do now?
- Ass to ass.

914
01:31:32,175 --> 01:31:35,875
Ass to ass!

915
01:31:44,575 --> 01:31:48,375
Put your spineless back into it!
Come on!

916
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:53,175
Ready? And...two!

917
01:31:57,175 --> 01:31:59,175
Ass to ass!

918
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:06,375
- Put it in there!
- That's it.

919
01:32:06,475 --> 01:32:09,475
Nice and easy.

920
01:32:09,575 --> 01:32:12,740
Mashed potatoes!

921
01:32:12,775 --> 01:32:15,575
Here's the close.
I need one gram. Bingo.

922
01:32:16,975 --> 01:32:21,475
Don't give up. Don't give up.
Move it, move it, move it!

923
01:32:22,575 --> 01:32:24,240
OK.

924
01:32:24,275 --> 01:32:26,875
Ready? And...three!

925
01:32:31,975 --> 01:32:34,775
Cum! Cum! Cum! Cum!

926
01:32:37,075 --> 01:32:40,175
We're gonna take it off
at the shoulder.

927
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:43,075
Cum! Cum! Cum! Cum!

928
01:32:48,675 --> 01:32:50,075
Saw.

929
01:33:30,475 --> 01:33:32,675
Marion!

930
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:38,975
It's all right.
Don't worry. You're in a hospital.

931
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:41,275
- Marion?
- Who's that?

932
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:43,675
She'll be sent for. She'll come.

933
01:33:46,175 --> 01:33:49,175
- No.
- No?

934
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:53,325
No, she won't.

935
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,275
She'll come.

936
01:35:59,475 --> 01:36:03,040
We got a winner.
We got a winner.

937
01:36:03,075 --> 01:36:06,575
Got a winner!
We got a winner.

938
01:36:06,675 --> 01:36:10,075
Our next winner
is that delightful personality,

939
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,340
from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

940
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:16,775
Please, give a juicy welcome
