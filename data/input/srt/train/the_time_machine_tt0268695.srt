1
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:55,604
THE TIME MACHINE

2
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,898
Aren't you
Forgetting something?

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:23,083
I know. It's something to do with
The third differential coefficient.

4
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:25,696
- Not that, Tonight,
- What?

5
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:28,240
Emma?

6
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:31,387
- What time is it?
- Almost 5:00,

7
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:33,996
Oh, God.

8
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:46,062
My proposal for utilizing
Solar power, rejected,

9
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:49,160
My concepts for harnessing
Micro-energy waves, rejected,

10
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:53,167
The dean suggests that I focus on
Something that might actually help mankind,

11
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:55,414
Like his study on the benefits
Of tobacco consumption,

12
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:59,061
Alex, the problem is
Your ideas are a bit too... radical,

13
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:01,976
The problem is with
The faculty. They're dinosaurs.

14
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:04,293
They're already extinct;
they just don't know it.

15
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:06,638
They'll be discovered by
some future archaeologist,

16
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,308
And he won't know what to make of them.

17
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,796
Their dim little eyes,
Devoid of any curiosity-

18
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:13,213
Alex, it's your first year
As associate professor.

19
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:16,473
You might want to play things
A little more conservatively.

20
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,970
You sound just like my father.

21
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:22,791
Look at them, Philby. All alike.
All in identical bowler hats.

22
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:25,151
Do you want your students
To turn out like that?

23
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:26,894
I want my students prepared For the

24
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:29,045
realities of the world
They’re about to greet.

25
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:31,104
Well, I don't. I want them to run along

26
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:33,485
This street and knock
off every bowler they see.

27
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,630
Mrs. Watch it!

28
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:40,957
Oh, huzzah, the master's home.

29
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:42,974
- Did you get it?
- Hello, Mr. Philby.

30
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:45,655
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.
You're looking in the pink.

31
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,088
Must be all the exercise I get scampering
Up and down these stairs like a wee lad.

32
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,230
- Don't torture me. Did you get it?
- I got it.

33
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:53,715
- Good. Let me see.
- But don't you think for one moment...

34
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:56,459
I'm going to let you go out
In that filthy jacket.

35
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,050
Now, go in there and change.

36
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:09,424
And you've got another letter
From that annoying little man.

37
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,904
Well, go ahead,
Switch it on,

38
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,449
- It'll help people keep
Their teeth well into their 40s,

39
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:21,318
- You might think about having that cleaned.
- Oh, who has the time?

40
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:24,755
- How did you know with Molly?
- Know what?

41
00:04:24,977 --> 00:04:26,503
You were meant to be together.

42
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:28,936
- She made the best
Shepherd’s pie I ever tasted.

43
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,069
Don't you have a single
Romantic bone in your body?

44
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:34,952
No. I'm all bowler hat.

45
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:40,981
Why do you waste your time
On that crack pot?

46
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:43,560
Because he has some
Very interesting ideas.

47
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,378
A professor at Columbia should not be

48
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,504
Corresponding with a
crazy German bookkeeper.

49
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:49,833
He's a patent clerk,
Not a bookkeeper.

50
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:53,684
I think Mr. Einstein deserves
All the support I can give him.

51
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:56,763
I wonder if we'll ever
Go too far?

52
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:58,851
- With what?
- With this.

53
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:01,934
With all of this.

54
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:04,182
No such thing.

55
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:09,463
All right. How do I look?

56
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:12,412
Practically decent. Really, Alex.
Good luck tonight.

57
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:15,653
She's a fine girl. She's done
Wonderful things for you.

58
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:19,508
Don't worry. You still have that
Alluring smell of chalk.

59
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:22,665
Oh, got to hurry.

60
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,874
Now, that's more like it.
You look a proper gentleman for once.

61
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:29,530
Well, you better hope so. If Emma
Turns me down, you'll be next.

62
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:32,837
Oh, I'm already swooning.

63
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:36,252
All right. Wish me luck.

64
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,109
Thank you.

65
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:55,320
Fresh flowers. Fresh flowers.

66
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,901
- Have some flowers, sir.
- Not tonight, thanks.

67
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:05,244
No. I promised her flowers.

68
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,149
Spectacular.

69
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:19,991
Spectacular waste of money.
Damn thing's always breaking down.

70
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:22,711
- Do you need a lift?
- Yes, yes.

71
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:24,752
- How do you keep The
water temperature stable?

72
00:06:24,753 --> 00:06:26,101
There's a cantilevered gasket...

73
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,523
on the fuel regulator-

74
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,620
Oh, God. Uh-

75
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:35,627
Much obliged.
I'm always forgetting the damn brake.

76
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:39,555
Hop in. I'll give you a perambulation
Before it breaks down again.

77
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:42,797
Oh, uh, I'm afraid
I have a prior engagement.

78
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,568
Well, another time then.
We perambulate here most every night.

79
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:47,362
Certainly.

80
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:53,732
Get a horse!

81
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,898
Yes.

82
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,721
Alexander?

83
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:42,454
Oh! Whoa.

84
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:48,018
- You're late, Professor.
- I got here as soon as I could.

85
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:52,571
Well, they say it's all the rage
in Paris. But I just picked it up-

86
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:57,957
- Five dollars at Macy's. Silly, isn't it?
- Very silly. I like it.

87
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:01,699
Well, where are they?

88
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,090
- What?
- The flowers.

89
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:06,506
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?

90
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,846
Oh, I'm sorry.
I- Well, I was distracted.

91
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:12,304
Well, there's something new.

92
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:15,922
Uh, Emma, I need to talk to you.

93
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:28,021
- Oh, uh, shall we walk through the park?
- Yes.

94
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:36,348
Professor, you're shivering. I hope
you're not coming down with something.

95
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,951
Well, I'm afraid I am.

96
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:45,862
I'm not sleeping very well, and even
When I'm awake, I'm not much use.

97
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:49,946
I can't eat or think
Or do much of any thing anymore.

98
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,280
And the worst part is,
I don't know that I'll ever be well.

99
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,855
I think there's only one remedy,
And that's for you to marry me...

100
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:05,764
- And spend the rest
Of your life with me.

101
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:12,550
Oh, Emma, I know it's right.
I know we're meant to be together.

102
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:16,722
It's the only thing in my entire life
I've never had to think about.

103
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,973
Oh, Alex.

104
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:23,531
Uh-Uh, wait.
I have something for you.

105
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,739
You know,
The moment is rather dying here.

106
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:36,674
I- I know.
Hold on. Oh.

107
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:50,709
- I know it's not a diamond.
- A moonstone.

108
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,770
Well, it's your birthstone.
I thought-

109
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,695
You thought right.

110
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:10,518
I just might cry,

111
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:14,584
I couldn't help but overhear.

112
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:20,432
Two fine young people starting out
On the road of life.

113
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:22,993
I wish you the very best.

114
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:26,574
- Well, thank you.
- And as much as I hate to do this-

115
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:31,285
Moved as I am by your...
Protestations of love-

116
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,680
I'll need your money now.

117
00:10:34,897 --> 00:10:37,856
- Sir?
- And your jewelry too.

118
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,795
I guess we could cal this
your first little bump

119
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:42,466
On the road to marital bliss.

120
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,880
I don't understand

121
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:46,259
- Don't make a scene.
There's no cause for that.

122
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,693
- Just give me your wallet, will you?
- Hmm?

123
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:53,255
Did you hear me, lad?

124
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:57,096
Uh, all right, all right.
Here. That's everything.

125
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,490
And your watch.

126
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:07,613
And the gloves.

127
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:16,447
- And the ring.
- No.

128
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:19,493
I'm afraid so, darling.

129
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:24,577
- And maybe he'll Buy you a diamond now.
- Please, please. Not that.

130
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:27,271
Don't!

131
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:41,488
Why did you do that?
It's only a ring.

132
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:48,118
Emma?

133
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:59,696
Emma?

134
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,790
Oh!

135
00:12:39,664 --> 00:12:43,183
What?

136
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:55,573
Oh. Oh, sir,
Mr. Philby's here.

137
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,050
- Here?
- Yes, sir, He insisted on coming-

138
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:03,548
- Tell him to go away, I'm busy,
- I won't go away, Alex.

139
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:08,601
My God.
What's happened to you?

140
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,336
I've been-
I've been working.

141
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:17,016
You remember that?
You used to care about your work.

142
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:20,768
I care more about my life.
And yours.

143
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:23,402
I came by the house every day
After the funeral...

144
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:26,346
And every week
And every other month.

145
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:30,551
Then I stopped coming.
Did you even notice?

146
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:35,323
- It hurt me, Alex... very much.
- Then why are you here now?

147
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:38,882
- There are some things I have to Say you
may not like hearing- - I know. I know.

148
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:42,905
You're concerned. I know.
I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.

149
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:46,713
But really...
I need you to go.

150
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:48,897
- I won't leave. Not
with You hiding down here.

151
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:49,628
I'm not hiding.

152
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,135
Alex, will you please
Stand still and look at me!

153
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,107
It wasn't your fault.

154
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:10,026
No. It wasn't my fault.

155
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:15,628
Maybe we should blame Mrs. Watchit for
picking up the ring from the jeweler.

156
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:19,061
Or the jeweler for making it.

157
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:24,077
Or the poor bastard who tore
The stone from the earth.

158
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:28,524
Maybe I should blame you For introducing
me to Emma In the first place. Yes.

159
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:33,348
Alexander, nothing will
Ever change what happened.

160
00:14:33,627 --> 00:14:38,746
No, you're wrong,
Because I will change it.

161
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:43,007
David, I appreciate
Your concern. I do.

162
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:46,263
But I ask you to have faith in me.

163
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:49,514
Well, I-I want to have
Faith in you, Alex, but-

164
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,767
What- What are-
What are you doing here?

165
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:58,784
I'll tell you what. Why don't you come by
for dinner In a week, and I'll show you?

166
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:03,271
- Why don't you come home With me now?
Molly- - Did you not hear me, David?

167
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:08,086
I can't leave
When I'm so close.

168
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:13,827
All right. We'll continue
This conversation in a week.

169
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:23,048
In a week, we'll never even
Have had this conversation.

170
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:36,607
Ah. Thank you, my good man.

171
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,147
You're early.
That's a first.

172
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:09,275
I wanted to see you.

173
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,802
Well, where are they?

174
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:16,185
- What?
- The flowers.

175
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,150
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?

176
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,840
You never cease
to surprise me.

177
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:45,334
Emma, I need to talk to you.

178
00:19:45,565 --> 00:19:48,844
- Shall we walk through the park?
- No!

179
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:51,307
No,

180
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:56,754
No. Let's go into the city.

181
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,555
- Alex, what is it?
- Nothing. Let's just hurry.

182
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:04,466
Running along is all very well for you.
You're not wearing a corset.

183
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,681
Bleecker Street, and be quick about it.

184
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:38,855
Now you're all gallant.

185
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:51,358
Professor, you're shivering. I hope
You’re not coming down with something.

186
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,997
No, no. I'm fine.

187
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,829
I'm wonderful. I'm walking down
The street with you again.

188
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,790
But we took a walk
Three days ago.

189
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:08,507
Well, not like this.
Never like this.

190
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:13,024
- Heavens, look at that car.
- Oh, I've seen it.

191
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:17,930
Now I know you're ill. You're passing up
The chance to explore some new gadget.

192
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:22,851
- It's only a machine.
- Alexander, tell me what's going on.

193
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:26,811
- Is something wrong?
- No.

194
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:29,935
No.
Emma, listen to me.

195
00:21:30,142 --> 00:21:33,381
I need to leave you now, but I want you
to go straight home and stay there.

196
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:36,600
I promise you I'll come
by sometime later tonight,

197
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:38,244
And I won't make any sense.

198
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:41,685
I'll be all upset that you didn't meet
Me in the park, but you must trust me.

199
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:44,786
Everything will be all right.

200
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:51,010
Just know how much I love you,
How much I'll always love you.

201
00:21:57,006 --> 00:22:00,326
All right.

202
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:03,871
But first, where are my flowers?

203
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:12,619
Flowers it is.

204
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:15,057
Wait right there.
Don't move.

205
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:28,442
- Oh, can I help you, sir?
- Yes, a dozen roses. White.

206
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,507
- No, no. Red.
- Look out!

207
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:55,561
Easy. Easy.

208
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:21,625
I'm looking for
Professor Hartdegen.

209
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:32,570
Alex, I'm-
I'm so sorry.

210
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:38,077
- This was not supposed to happen.
- Of course not.

211
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,047
- I know there's nothing I can say.
- We were out of the park, Philby.

212
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:46,534
We were safe.

213
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:52,265
Why can't I change it?

214
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,258
I could come back
A thousand times.

215
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,318
See her die a thousand ways.

216
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,774
I don't-
I don't understand.

217
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,187
I can't find the answer here.

218
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,603
Not here.

219
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:24,565
Not now.

220
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:51,542
The future is now.

Nice suit.

I always seem to have that effect.

00:30:44,315 --> 00:30:47,155
Over here, sir.

257
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:51,785

260
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:04,574

Photonic?

265
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:20,302
A compendium
of all human knowledge.

266
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:24,884
- Oh.
- Area of inquiry?

267
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:28,512
- Do you know anything about physics?
- Ah, accessing physics.

268
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,499
Mechanical engineering.

269
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,459
Dimensional optics.
Chronography.

270

Accessing science fiction.

273
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:49,101
No, no. Practical application. My
question is why can't One change the past?

274
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:54,987
Because one cannot travel
into the past.

275
00:31:59,024 --> 00:32:01,904
- What-What if one could?
- One can not.

276
00:32:02,112 --> 00:32:05,792
Excuse me, this is something
You should trust me on.

277
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,871
Accessing the writings
Of Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells,

Harlan Elison,
Alexander Hartdegen-

279
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:15,292
- Tel me about him.
- Alexander Hartdegen, 1869 to 1903,

280

Found writings include treatise
On the creation of a time machine.

282
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:23,273
Tel me about the time machine.

283
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,484
- Time Machine was written
by H.G. Wells in 1894.

284
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:29,480
It was a motion picture by George Pal and
a stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber-

285
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:30,684
That's not what I mean.

286
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:32,804
- Would you like to hear
Selections from the score?

287
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:36,622
- No.
- There's a place called tomorrow

288
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:40,139
A place of joy
Not of sorrow

289
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:43,203
Can't you see
It’s a place for you and-

290
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,846
Thank you.
That's quite enough.

291
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,100
Will there be anything else?

292
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:53,449
Uh, no. No, I think I'll have better
Luck in a few hundred years.

293
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,550
Live long and prosper.

294
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:47,510
Sir, where is your
designated evacuation center?

295
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:49,691
Sir, you are subject
To arrest under martial law-

296
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:52,137
Please put your hands out,
Palms together.

297
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,798
You will be held in detention until your
Evacuation center clears you for transport.

298
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,470
- Wait, wait!
- Just take it easy.

299
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,337
- Hey, we got to get out of here!
- Wait. How did this happen?

300
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,258
The moon. Come on.
Move it.

301
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,578
- That's impossible, what happened?
- You been living under a rock?

302
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,960
Yes, I've been living
Under a rock. Now, tell me.

303
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,109
The demolitions for the lunar colonies
Screwed up the orbit, okay?

304
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:22,108
The moon's breaking up.
All right? Come on.

305
00:34:25,484 --> 00:34:29,203
Hey! Forget him! Come on!

306
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,240
Emma?

307
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:09,775
Shh!

308
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:14,073
Hello?

309
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:51,297
Hello.

310
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,815
Don't be afraid.

311
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,201
Oh, wait.
Don't- Don't go.

312
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:30,947
Wait. I just want to talk to you.

313
00:40:03,743 --> 00:40:08,422
Hello.

314
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:12,386
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't understand you.

315
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:14,906
- Do you know my words?
- Yes.

316
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:23,493
The lex,
The stone language.

317
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:27,283
The stone language? But do you
Understand me? Do you understand me?

318
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:30,400
We all learn it
When we're young,

319
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:34,166
They tor'jen,
Forget. They forget it.

320
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:37,002
But I teach,

321
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:48,365
What is he saying?

322
00:40:48,366 --> 00:40:50,904
- They're trying to decide if
we Should throw you in the river.

323
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,529
Tel me quickly, and tell me the truth.
Where do you come from?

324
00:40:57,971 --> 00:41:01,371
Well, actually, I'm from here.
Uh, just not from now.

325
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,759
You see, I built a machine that allows
Me to travel through time.

326
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,745
I'm from the past.

327
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:11,703
Oh.

328
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:32,206
I told them you hit your head...

329
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:35,984
And you are a wandering idiot.

330
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:54,147
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready for the moor,

331
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:59,367
- The night.
- Oh. I'll come with you.

332
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:24,205
- Eloi?
- What are your people named?

333
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:28,561
Well, I...I guess
You’d call us New Yorkers.

334
00:42:28,825 --> 00:42:32,104
New Yorkers.
Are they friendly?

335
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:35,369
Until you talk to them.

336
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:42,182
- Tell me about your village.
- It's a very busy place.

337
00:42:42,423 --> 00:42:46,022
Everyone seems to be in a hurry.
And they all wear identical bowler hats.

338
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:50,035
Little black round things
On their heads.

339
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:54,944
- What do you do there?
- Well, I was a teacher like Mara.

340
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,229
- And I make things,
- Me also,

341
00:43:03,656 --> 00:43:05,377
A sess'quin'tan?

342
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:09,052
Mara, der'enjen'wen len?

343
00:43:09,245 --> 00:43:13,884
Sess'quin'tan,
Steps of rope.

344
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:17,126
Oh, a rope ladder.

345
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:19,418
We can make one.
I will teach you.

346
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:25,752
Will you tell me more lon'el
On the next day?

347
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:29,013
Tomorrow?
Yes, I will.

348
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:32,587
Why don't you take care
Of this for me tonight?

349
00:43:32,814 --> 00:43:36,054
Thank you.

350
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:51,434
- Good night.
- Good night.

351
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:02,621
Kalen will tire you if you let him.
He's always been questioning.

352
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,249
Our parents were firm,
But it is his way.

353
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:16,914
- Where are your parents?
- They've gone from this place.

354
00:44:17,198 --> 00:44:20,398
Oh, I'm sorry.

355
00:44:41,892 --> 00:44:46,372
You were right,
Philby. I did go too far.

356
00:44:48,818 --> 00:44:51,217
Sit with me.

357
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:00,746
Mara, why do you
pull the boats up at night?

358
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,918
Afraid they'll be stolen?

359
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:06,761
Stolen?
I do not know that word.

360
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,644
Well, are you afraid that
Someone will take them?

361
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:13,121
- It is just more safe this way.
- Oh.

362
00:45:13,345 --> 00:45:16,814
- You must do things to be
safe Where you come from?

363
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:17,665
Of course,

364
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:24,345
Or when you come from.

365
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:27,606
Ah, so I'm not just
A wandering idiot.

366
00:45:37,414 --> 00:45:40,693
Col'mar,

367
00:45:40,918 --> 00:45:42,718
Maybe we could
Find some tomorrow.

368
00:45:45,214 --> 00:45:47,493
Flowers?

369
00:46:17,334 --> 00:46:20,334
Alexander, Alexander,

370
00:46:42,028 --> 00:46:46,028
Ah! Morlock!

371
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:32,256
- Is he all right?
- He had a dream.

372
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,299
Oh. So did I.

373
00:47:40,054 --> 00:47:42,534
I was moving
Through a jungle-

374
00:47:42,723 --> 00:47:45,563
And you saw a shape
Ahead of you.

375
00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:50,208
Well, a face that...
called my name.

376
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:53,442
We all have that dream.

377
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,379
- All of you?
- Yes. Now go back asleep.

378
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:03,096
You're still not well,

379
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:06,529
What does that mean,
"Morlock"?

380
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:11,510
A child's dream.
No more.

381
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:14,516
Go back asleep,

382
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:40,554
We keep these stones
In many places,

383
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:44,588
This is the room where my parents
Taught me for the first time.

384
00:48:54,346 --> 00:48:57,625
Why do you learn this language
if you don't use it?

385
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:01,210
It's a tradition we hand down.

386
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:05,237
It meant something once.
Must be here for a reason.

387
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,333
"One generation passed away,
And another comes.

388
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:14,652
But the earth abided forever. "

389
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,279
Why have you come here?

390
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:24,903
Why have you traveled
Through time?

391
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:27,928
To have a question answered.

392
00:49:28,134 --> 00:49:30,534
Question?

393
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:33,441
Yes. Why can't I change the past?

394
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:35,842
Why would you want to?

395
00:49:42,443 --> 00:49:45,123
You've lost someone.

396
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:50,307
Someone you loved very much.

397
00:50:01,006 --> 00:50:04,686
- Mara, why are there No older people here?
- What do you mean?

398
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,887
Older people, your parents' age
Or grandparents' age.

399
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,980
They've gone from this place.

400
00:50:12,184 --> 00:50:14,384
You mean, they're dead?

401
00:50:14,563 --> 00:50:17,362
Yes.

402
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:21,846
All of them?
How is that possible?

403
00:50:22,113 --> 00:50:25,153
There are things
Better left not said.

404
00:50:25,366 --> 00:50:29,926
We don't dwell
On the past, Alexander.

405
00:50:30,205 --> 00:50:32,924
- We do something else.
- What?

406
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:36,602
We remember them...

407
00:50:36,797 --> 00:50:39,197
With these,

408
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:58,957
Alexander!

409
00:51:06,788 --> 00:51:09,348
Alexander.

410
00:51:13,296 --> 00:51:15,975
- Are you coming to work
now? Come with me- - No.

411
00:51:16,132 --> 00:51:19,012
Alexander's not well enough.
We're going to see his machine.

412
00:51:19,178 --> 00:51:25,337
- Now?
- Stay with Toren.

413
00:51:25,643 --> 00:51:30,362
- Go the next day, tomorrow.
- I need to see that it's all right.

414
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,009
This way.

415
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:38,496
Will you tell me more about
N- New York tonight?

416
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,900
I will.

417
00:52:25,587 --> 00:52:29,866
Oh, good.
It seems fine.

418
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:33,013
We had quite a ride together.

419
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:37,900
- It's ready?
- Appears so.

420
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:41,621
Will you use it now?
Go back to your own time?

421
00:52:43,565 --> 00:52:46,924
Well, I- I guess I could.

422
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:51,412
Uh...

423
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:55,084
It seems so long ago.

424
00:52:55,245 --> 00:52:57,285
No. You should go.

425
00:52:57,457 --> 00:53:02,297
And I need to ask,
Will you take Kalen with you?

426
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:03,018
Why?

427
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:07,186
- Alexander, take him away,
Back to your time. Will you?

428
00:53:07,426 --> 00:53:10,786
- Mara, why?
- Please. You don't know.

429
00:53:11,014 --> 00:53:14,094
Take him away from here.

430
00:53:14,268 --> 00:53:17,108
Kalen!

431
00:53:25,864 --> 00:53:27,624
Mara, what's going on?

432
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:30,223
They're early!
We must get Kalen!

433
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:18,375
Kalen!

434
00:54:20,384 --> 00:54:23,144
Kalen! Kalen!

435
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,808
Mara!

436
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:43,504
- Kalen!
- No, stay here.

437
00:56:43,671 --> 00:56:46,031
Stay in the group!

438
00:56:58,814 --> 00:57:00,814
Run!

439
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,245
Mara!

440
00:59:21,477 --> 00:59:23,717
Mara!

441
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:42,791
Where did they take them?

442
00:59:43,043 --> 00:59:45,347
- We have to follow them.
We have to find them.

443
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,643
We do not. Col'quin tor,

444
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:51,080
- Why not?
- This is nem Eloi'tas, our life here.

445
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:58,469
- How can you just do nothing?
- How can tor'tasal'mor,

446
00:59:58,727 --> 01:00:00,966
- It is the day and the night.
- The day and the night.

447
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:04,747
This is the world.

448
01:00:04,985 --> 01:00:09,105
Why don't you fight back?

449
01:00:09,364 --> 01:00:12,764
Fight back. Why not?

450
01:00:12,994 --> 01:00:18,394
Those who farquil'pax...
Fight-

451
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:21,308
Are taken first.

452
01:00:26,926 --> 01:00:29,166
- Kalen, do you know Where they're taken?
- No.

453
01:00:29,346 --> 01:00:31,226
- Do they ever come back?
- No.

454
01:00:31,348 --> 01:00:33,467
- Has anyone ever followed them?
- I don't know.

455
01:00:33,601 --> 01:00:35,095
- Well, what about the
Morlocks? There must be a leader.

456
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:35,881
We're not supposed to talk.

457
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:38,141
Kalen, listen to me.
Listen.

458
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:41,194
Sometimes we need to Accept what's
happening to us Even if we don't want to.

459
01:00:41,401 --> 01:00:45,800
And other times we have to fight,
Even if we're afraid.

460
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:49,793
Now, it's difficult
To understand, I know.

461
01:00:50,036 --> 01:00:53,516
Believe me, I know.
Now, they're afraid,

462
01:00:53,748 --> 01:00:56,868
And I'm asking you not to be.

463
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:59,845
So will you tell me what you know?

464
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:03,646
We can save her.
Please.

465
01:01:05,387 --> 01:01:10,266
When they go,
We’re not supposed to talk about it.

466
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:17,031
- But we all know the place.
- What place?

467
01:01:17,275 --> 01:01:21,795
Where the ghosts are.

468
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:46,519
Here it is.

469
01:02:22,182 --> 01:02:26,582
Welcome to VOX system,
How may I help you?

470
01:02:26,854 --> 01:02:30,894
- It's all right.
- How may I serve you?

471
01:02:31,108 --> 01:02:34,348
What can I get you?
Oh, let's see.

472
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:37,371
Um, Henry James.
Oh, no. Yes?

473
01:02:37,575 --> 01:02:42,534
No, no, no, Too depressing, Hemingway,
Perhaps? No, Too sweaty,

474
01:02:42,831 --> 01:02:45,951
Plato, Proust, Pinter,
Poe, Pound?

475
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:48,927
No. Complete Works
of Martha Stewart?

476
01:02:49,088 --> 01:02:54,327
Ah, I have it!
Jules Verne.

477
01:02:54,636 --> 01:02:57,676
- Right up your alley, I would think,
- Photonic, right?

478
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:01,449
Or what's left of one,
What's left of all of them?

479
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:06,563
I am the last, and "these fragments
I have shored against my ruins. "

480
01:03:06,858 --> 01:03:08,739
T.S. Eliot.

481
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:13,260
You wouldn't know him yet,
But he is so depressing, yet so divine.

482
01:03:16,368 --> 01:03:20,248
Oh, I'm sorry. The lending library
is temporarily out of service.

483
01:03:20,499 --> 01:03:25,258
Not to worry. I have them all right
here- every page of every volume.

484
01:03:25,546 --> 01:03:28,466
Can you tell me
What’s happening here?

485
01:03:28,632 --> 01:03:31,672
Well, my sources are
No longer fully annotated,

486
01:03:31,887 --> 01:03:36,166
And my information is somewhat Anecdotal,
but I believe What was once one race...

487
01:03:36,392 --> 01:03:38,513
is now two.

488
01:03:38,686 --> 01:03:42,045
One above
And one below.

489
01:03:42,274 --> 01:03:45,313
Two distinct species
That have evolved.

490
01:03:45,486 --> 01:03:49,446
- And how do those below survive?
- That is the real question, isn't it?

491
01:03:56,372 --> 01:04:00,412
- I don't believe it.
- Well,

492
01:04:00,669 --> 01:04:04,668
If you don't like the answers,
You should avoid asking the questions.

493
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:11,575
Look at them.
They have no knowledge of the past,

494
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:15,326
No ambition for the future,

495
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,679
- So lucky.
- Why would you say something like that?

496
01:04:22,569 --> 01:04:27,328
Can you even imagine what it's like
to remember everything?

497
01:04:27,617 --> 01:04:31,816
I remember a six-year-old girl Who asked
me about dinosaurs 800,000 years ago.

498
01:04:32,081 --> 01:04:37,200
I remember the last book I recommended:
Look Homeward, Angel, by Thomas Wolfe.

499
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:41,702
And yes,
I even remember you,

500
01:04:47,223 --> 01:04:50,902
Time travel:
Practical application.

501
01:04:51,143 --> 01:04:55,182
How do you know about the Morlocks
if you can't leave this place?

502
01:04:55,439 --> 01:04:59,958
There was one Eloi who managed
to escape, He told me everything,

503
01:05:04,491 --> 01:05:09,010
We spent years together,
Just talking.

504
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:15,067
The conversation's a little spotty now,
But I do remember.

505
01:05:15,337 --> 01:05:20,177
- It's good to have a friend.
- Then you can help us find the Morlocks,

506
01:05:20,427 --> 01:05:22,347
Find Mara.

507
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:29,217
And if the truth is so horrible,
And will haunt your dreams for all time?

508
01:05:31,023 --> 01:05:34,662
Well, I think I'm used to that.

509
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:44,528
My friend said he came from the east,
From the jungle.

510
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,799
- will you describe it?
- I don't have to.

511
01:05:52,172 --> 01:05:55,731
Just follow the breathing.

512
01:06:28,545 --> 01:06:33,825
In the dream, we're moving toward it,
But I think it was meant to keep us away,

513
01:06:39,642 --> 01:06:42,521
- I might just go in by myself.
- No.

514
01:06:42,688 --> 01:06:47,447
Mara would be very cross with me
if you got hurt. Now, I'll find her,

515
01:06:47,693 --> 01:06:49,513
But I need you to go back To the village

516
01:06:49,514 --> 01:06:51,652
and light a fire So we
can find our way home.

517
01:06:51,906 --> 01:06:54,745
- All right? Will you do that for me?
- I lost your pocket watch.

518
01:06:54,951 --> 01:06:58,990
They took it from my room.

519
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,568
I'm sorry.

520
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,888
Why would they take it?

521
01:08:02,403 --> 01:08:05,203
Oh. Stupid.

522
01:10:11,925 --> 01:10:14,005
Mara?

523
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:40,510
Mara?

524
01:11:40,692 --> 01:11:42,652
Mara.

525
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:46,579
Mara?

526
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:58,185
Come a little closer.
I don't bite.

527
01:12:13,605 --> 01:12:16,444
Do I surprise you?

528
01:12:16,608 --> 01:12:19,888
- A little. Yes.
- Hmm.

529
01:12:20,113 --> 01:12:25,712
We weren't always like this.
After the moon fell from the sky,

530
01:12:26,036 --> 01:12:29,956
The Earth could no longer
Sustain the species.

531
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,047
Some managed to stay above,

532
01:12:33,253 --> 01:12:36,612
The rest of us
Escaped underground,

533
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:42,039
Then centuries later, When we tried to
reemerge Into the sun again, we couldn't,

534
01:12:42,347 --> 01:12:47,866
So we bred ourselves
Into castes.

535
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:51,584
Some to be our eyes and ears.

536
01:12:51,773 --> 01:12:55,933
- Some to be our muscles and sinews.
- You mean you’re hunters.

537
01:12:58,156 --> 01:13:03,674
Yes. Bred to be predators,
But bred also to be controlled.

538
01:13:03,954 --> 01:13:07,874
You see,
My caste concentrated...

539
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:11,285
On expanding
Our cerebral abilities.

540
01:13:11,463 --> 01:13:16,582
- You control their thoughts.
- Not just theirs.

541
01:13:18,554 --> 01:13:21,673
The Eloi.

542
01:13:21,849 --> 01:13:26,048
So it's not enough that you hunt
Them down like animals.

543
01:13:26,313 --> 01:13:30,112
- That's their role here.
- To be your food?

544
01:13:32,236 --> 01:13:34,277
Yes.

545
01:13:34,447 --> 01:13:38,646
And for those who are suitable,
To be breeding vessels...

546
01:13:38,869 --> 01:13:41,909
For our other colonies.

547
01:13:42,122 --> 01:13:46,242
You see,
I'm just one of many,

548
01:13:46,502 --> 01:13:50,622
I don't understand how you can sit there
And speak so coldly about this.

549
01:13:54,178 --> 01:13:58,097
Have you not considered the human
Cost of- of what it is you're doing?

550
01:13:58,349 --> 01:14:01,349
We all pay a price...

551
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,153
Alexander.

552
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:18,783
Don't worry.
You're safe.

553
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:23,210
I control them.

554
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:26,699
Without that control,

555
01:14:26,881 --> 01:14:30,440
They would
Exhaust the food supply...

556
01:14:30,678 --> 01:14:33,437
in a matter of months.

557
01:14:33,598 --> 01:14:37,437
Food supply?
They're human beings!

558
01:14:37,687 --> 01:14:39,767
Who are you...

559
01:14:39,896 --> 01:14:43,656
To question 800,000 years...

560
01:14:47,655 --> 01:14:49,415
Of evolution?

561
01:14:49,574 --> 01:14:53,294
- This is- This is a perversion
Of every natural law.

562
01:14:53,537 --> 01:14:59,177
And what is time travel But your pathetic
attempt to Control the world around you,

563
01:14:59,502 --> 01:15:04,421
- your futile effort to have
A question answered?

564
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:08,076
Do you think I don't know you,
Alexander?

565
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:13,925
I can look
Inside your memories,

566
01:15:14,145 --> 01:15:18,224
Your nightmares,
Your dreams.

567
01:15:18,441 --> 01:15:23,640
You're a man haunted by
Those two most terrible words:

568
01:15:23,946 --> 01:15:27,746
What if?

569
01:16:14,963 --> 01:16:17,802
Look at you!

570
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:21,007
- And along ponytail-
- Daddy!

571
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:25,539
- Who's that? Is it Daddy?
- Daddy! - Long ponytail,

572
01:16:25,809 --> 01:16:30,089
And we're still having lots of fun,

573
01:16:30,356 --> 01:16:33,716
Right, Right.

574
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:49,834
Da-da! Daddy.

575
01:16:51,255 --> 01:16:55,415
You built your time machine
Because of Emma's death.

576
01:16:55,676 --> 01:16:59,075
If she had lived,
It would never have existed.

577
01:16:59,264 --> 01:17:02,904
So how could you use your machine
To go back to save her?

578
01:17:03,142 --> 01:17:07,582
You are
The inescapable result...

579
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:10,536
Of your tragedy,

580
01:17:10,735 --> 01:17:13,134
Just as I...

581
01:17:13,321 --> 01:17:18,440
Am the inescapable result...
Of you.

582
01:17:57,871 --> 01:18:01,951
You have your answer.
Now go.

583
01:18:35,915 --> 01:18:39,795
I believe you have something
That belongs to me.

584
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:50,369
- We all have our time machines,
Don’t we?

585
01:18:52,977 --> 01:18:56,057
Those that take us back
Are memories...

586
01:18:57,231 --> 01:19:00,471
And those that
Carry us forward...

587
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:05,641
Are dreams.

588
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:14,350
- You're forgetting one thing.
- Huh?

589
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:22,254
What if?

590
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:53,898
- What are you doing with it?
- Changing the future.

591
01:22:56,711 --> 01:22:58,832
Come on.

592
01:23:38,343 --> 01:23:41,423
Wait. Wait here.

593
01:25:13,117 --> 01:25:14,996
Go.

594
01:25:28,593 --> 01:25:30,713
Hurry!

595
01:25:37,227 --> 01:25:39,547
Huh?

596
01:25:52,119 --> 01:25:54,199
Alexander!

597
01:26:41,217 --> 01:26:44,936
I'm sorry
You lost your machine.

598
01:26:46,808 --> 01:26:51,806
Oh, it's all right.
It was only a machine.

599
01:27:14,089 --> 01:27:17,248
"The congregation rose and stared...

600
01:27:17,467 --> 01:27:21,426
"While the three dead boys
Came marching up the aisle:

601
01:27:21,638 --> 01:27:24,638
"Tom in their lead,
Joe next,

602
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:28,690
"And Huck,
A ruin of drooping rags,

603
01:27:28,938 --> 01:27:32,138
"sneaking sheepishly in the rear.

604
01:27:32,317 --> 01:27:37,436
"They had hid in an unused gallery,
Listening to their own funeral sermon.

605
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:40,940
Aunt Poly, Mary and the Harpers
Threw themselves upon them-"

606
01:27:41,161 --> 01:27:44,120
This is the place.

607
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:46,890
So it is.

608
01:27:52,423 --> 01:27:56,383
- But there's nothing here.
- Well, it was different then.

609
01:27:56,636 --> 01:27:59,636
My laboratory
was all around here.

610
01:27:59,806 --> 01:28:03,605
The kitchen was up there
Where that tree is.

611
01:28:05,646 --> 01:28:08,886
Not that Mrs. Watchit
Ever let me go in there.

612
01:28:12,696 --> 01:28:16,536
I don't know
What to tell you, sir.

613
01:28:16,785 --> 01:28:19,584
He's been gone
This whole week.

614
01:28:19,789 --> 01:28:22,748
And you've no idea
Where he went?

615
01:28:22,957 --> 01:28:25,798
- No, sir.
- This would be my green house,

616
01:28:26,003 --> 01:28:29,323
There was a garden outside.

617
01:28:29,507 --> 01:28:32,507
Gren 'tormar'tas?

618
01:28:32,677 --> 01:28:34,718
Yes.

619
01:28:34,888 --> 01:28:38,368
- I'm glad.
- Sir?

620
01:28:38,558 --> 01:28:41,119
I'm glad he's gone.

621
01:28:41,312 --> 01:28:45,271
Maybe he's finally found someplace
Where he can be happy.

622
01:28:46,653 --> 01:28:50,412
- This was my home.
- His home.

623
01:28:50,656 --> 01:28:52,976
Long ago.

624
01:28:55,537 --> 01:28:59,535
You know, Molly and I were talking
About engaging a housekeeper,

625
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:02,791
Someone to live with us
And help take care of Jamie.

626
01:29:03,003 --> 01:29:05,763
Would you be interested?

627
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:12,454
- Perhaps just until the master returns.
- Of course.

628
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:16,562
- But there'd be some changes made.
I run a tight house.

629
01:29:16,811 --> 01:29:21,570
Oh, I have no doubt of that. I'll call
By in the morning, and we'll arrange it.

630
01:29:21,859 --> 01:29:25,658
- Good night, Mrs. Watchit.
- Good night, Mr. Philby.

631
01:29:40,797 --> 01:29:45,516
Godspeed, my fine lad.

632
01:29:45,802 --> 01:29:47,681
Godspeed.
