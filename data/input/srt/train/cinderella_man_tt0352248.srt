1
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:48,356
Attaboy! Keep him busy!

2
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:54,925
- One! Two!
- You got it!

3
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:59,960
Three! Four! Five!

4
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:03,100
Six! Seven!

5
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:06,146
Eight! Nine!

6
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:09,046
Ten! Out!

7
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:16,021
Come here, Jimmy.
Get that Sleeping Beauty out of here!

8
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:20,319
- That’s ten in a row, Jimmy.
- A knockout!

9
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:23,522
At one minute 46 seconds
of the second round,

10
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:27,532
tonight’s light heavyweight winner
from the great state of New Jersey,

11
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:31,263
the Bulldog of Bergen, James J. Braddock!

12
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:45,080
- You’re gonna be the next champ!
- How you doing?

13
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:48,178
- Just a few. Leave ‘em wanting.
- Wanna sign my name for me?

14
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:51,247
Well, at least then they can read it.

15
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,929
You’ve been getting stronger
with every fight.

16
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,024
You favor the right, sure,
but you got no stage fright.

17
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:05,127
And you have never been knocked out.
You’re in line. That’s all I’m saying.

18
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:07,833
You’re gonna get your shot.

19
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:11,036
All right, let me see what we’ve got here.

20
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:14,773
$886 for Jeanette,
$772 for Lou and Whitey.

21
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:19,545
A thousand bucks for the ring fees,
my $2,658 and your $3,544,

22
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:22,384
makes $8,860.

23
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:25,584
Stick that in your mattress, Irishman.

24
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,219
When we get there,
you gonna come in and see the kids?

25
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:31,059
It’s been a while. Come on.
They miss their Uncle Joey.

26
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:35,293
That’s very sweet.
You still married to the same girl?

27
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,429
- I was this morning.
- Congratulations. I’ll take a rain check.

28
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:44,703
And would you tell her I undercharged
on the gym fees and no load on the towel?

29
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:47,145
- I’ll be sure to point that out.
- I appreciate it.

30
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:49,706
Would you stop
up at the corner here, Frank?

31
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:53,583
Home to Jersey
for Mr. Adventure over here.

32
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,855
All right. See you, Frank.

33
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,372
Oh, I could kill you!

34
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,576
I like the sound of that.

35
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:26,176
I like the sound of that a lot.

36
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:27,744
- Jimmy.
- Yeah?

37
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:29,915
My sister.

38
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:32,857
Daddy, did we win?

39
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:37,228
Yeah, we won. How are ya Alice?

40
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:40,664
- Good. That’s wonderful, Jimmy.
- Hey, Howard.

41
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,143
Thank you.

42
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,702
So, tell me about it.

43
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:55,738
Was he a real slugger?

44
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:59,115
You know...

45
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,982
you could come and watch.

46
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,353
No.

47
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:11,486
You get hit, every time
it feels like I’m gettin’ hit too.

48
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,057
And I’m not half as tough as you are.

49
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,105
So...

50
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:24,438
- Tell me about the girls.
- Girls?

51
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:33,342
- I was at the Garden, it was a fight night...
- There was one. There must’ve been one.

52
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:35,853
No.

53
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:38,051
- Blonde?
- Brunette.

54
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,488
Tall?

55
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,091
Like a gazelle.

56
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,364
I don’t know how it is
she breathed up there.

57
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:53,366
Mr. Braddock!

58
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:58,640
You’re so strong!

59
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:01,147
And your hands...

60
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:03,978
they’re so big.

61
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,418
You’re so powerful.

62
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:12,858
Jimmy.

63
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:17,829
I’m so proud of you.

64
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:26,034
Introducing two-times
state Golden Gloves titleholder,

65
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:29,098
in both the light heavyweight
and heavyweight divisions,

66
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,941
21 and 0, with 16 wins
coming by way of a knockout,

67
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:37,939
the Bulldog of Bergen,
the pride of New Jersey

68
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:43,613
and the hope of the Irish
as the future champion of the world,

69
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:47,750
James J. Braddock!

70
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:25,154
Mom, you woke me up.

71
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:30,565
You kicked the covers off, honey.
Go to sleep.

72
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:42,603
- I can’t find my socks.
- Jim.

73
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,940
I’m sorry.

74
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,707
Mama.

75
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:50,648
- Great.
- I’m sorry, baby.

76
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,118
I washed ‘em last night.
Took ‘em right off your feet.

77
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,281
- Don’t you remember?
- No.

78
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,221
You were out like a light.

79
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:11,227
How do I keep ‘em this warm?

80
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:14,638
Mama, I want to eat too.

81
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:18,041
Mommy’ll get you some, honey.

82
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:23,579
Hey, Rosy-Rosy.
Good morning, good morning.

83
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:31,015
We got a notice yesterday.
Gas and electric.

84
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:35,957
Come on. Okey-dokey. There we go.

85
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,123
I’ll get the milk.

86
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:05,615
Well, I think there’s some left over.

87
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:08,095
Yup.

88
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:12,028
You know I got that fight tonight
at the Armory.

89
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:16,262
One guy. Abe Feldman.

90
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:20,169
- It’s 50 bucks, win or lose.
- That’s good.

91
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:23,442
If I beat him, maybe I can
get my purses back up to $75.

92
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,877
That would be great.

93
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:28,714
Rosy.

94
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,016
Use your fork, please.

95
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:35,617
Who needs a cow?

96
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,851
Mama, I want some more.

97
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:43,485
I’m sorry, sweetheart.
We need to save some for the boys.

98
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:49,064
Here you go.

99
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:54,400
You know, Mae, I dreamed last night
that I was havin’ dinner at the Ritz.

100
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:57,341
- With Mickey Rooney and George Raft.
- Really?

101
00:10:57,401 --> 00:11:01,641
I dreamed I had a steak.
A thick, juicy steak.

102
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:03,706
Like this, Rosy.

103
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:08,514
Then I had a mountain of mashed potatoes
and I went back for ice cream three times.

104
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,183
I’m stuffed. I’m absolutely full.
I cannot eat another thing.

105
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:17,656
Want to give me a hand?

106
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:19,291
Jim...

107
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:23,166
Jimmy.

108
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:48,558
Boys, hurry up. Don’t dawdle.

109
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:51,392
Let’s try and sleep a little more.

110
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:03,271
Sure, business is bunk,
And Wall Street is sunk

111
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:07,869
We’re all of us broke, And ready to croak

112
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:11,906
We’ve nothing to dunk, Can’t even get drunk

113
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:16,250
And all the while, They tell us to smile

114
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:18,417
Cheer up, gentle citizens

115
00:12:18,482 --> 00:12:20,517
Though you have no shirts

116
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:24,460
Happy days are here again,
Cheer up, smile, nertz

117
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:28,728
All aboard prosperity,
Giggle till it hurts

118
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:32,964
No more bread-line charity,
Cheer up, smile, nertz

119
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,974
Sunny smilers we must be,
The optimist asserts

120
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:40,944
Let’s hang the fathead to a tree,
Cheer up, smile, nertz

121
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:43,915
Here, Jake. Over here.

122
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:46,385
I need nine men, and only nine.

123
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:50,446
One. Two.

124
00:12:50,514 --> 00:12:52,719
Three. Four.

125
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:56,562
Five. Six.

126
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:03,401
Seven. Eight.

127
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:05,564
Nine. That’s it!

128
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:10,031
All right, let’s get a move on.

129
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,340
Come on! Get going.

130
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:15,074
Not a lot of work today.

131
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,414
See you tomorrow, all right?

132
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:31,993
Hey, Dad.

133
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,795
- No shifts today, Dad?
- What are you doing, son?

134
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:37,530
I’m being good, I’m being quiet,
I’m being ‘have.

135
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:39,164
Great.

136
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:42,732
Daddy! Daddy!

137
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:47,473
- Rosy-cheeks. How you doin’?
- Daddy! Jay stole.

138
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:49,845
- What?
- Jay stole.

139
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,555
- What’s all this about?
- See? It’s a salami.

140
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:07,495
Young lady, your brother’s in enough
trouble without you tellin’ on him.

141
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:11,127
It’s from the butcher’s, and he won’t say
a word about it. Will you, Jay?

142
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,730
Will you, Jay?

143
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:20,210
OK, pick it up. Let’s go.

144
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:25,343
Do not test me, boy. Right now.

145
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:32,982
Howard, stay here.

146
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,290
Marty Johnson had to go away
to Delaware to live with his uncle.

147
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:11,922
- Why?
- His parents didn’t have enough to eat.

148
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:22,972
Yeah, well, things ain’t easy
at the moment, Jay. You’re right.

149
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:26,170
But there’s a lot of people
worse off than what we are.

150
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:33,576
Just ‘cause things ain’t easy, that’s
no excuse to take what’s not yours, is it?

151
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:36,986
That’s stealing, right? And we don’t steal.

152
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:39,786
No matter what happens, we don’t steal.

153
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,850
Not ever. You got me?

154
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,926
- Are you giving me your word?
- Yes.

155
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:54,337
- Goon.
- I promise.

156
00:15:58,469 --> 00:16:00,970
And I promise you...

157
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:04,743
we will never send you away.

158
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:12,657
It’s OK, kid.

159
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:15,887
You got a little scared. I understand.

160
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:18,056
It’s OK.

161
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:42,210
He’s a very slow guy.
Just plants himself there.

162
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,780
So you just keep him steady,
keep him trapped in the middle.

163
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:49,157
Keep dancing around him, OK?

164
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,198
You know what to do. You know this type.

165
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,861
The guy’s a bum.

166
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:03,508
Two bits will get a guy a seat.

167
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:07,807
And that guy gets to watch you bleed
and call you a bum.

168
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:12,281
And I know I gotta take it from
him ‘cause he’s a paying customer.

169
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:14,787
I see.

170
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:17,186
Well, well, well, well, well.

171
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:19,385
Pardon me, miss.

172
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:23,155
Allow me to restate my position.

173
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,596
Mr. Abraham Feldman is a novice fighter

174
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:29,601
whose ass you should gently kick

175
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,263
until it is humped up
between his shoulder blades.

176
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,434
That is if it doesn’t offend
your overly sensitive nature. God knows.

177
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:54,389
- Now, that break’s still a few weeks away.
- I know.

178
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,986
- You were gonna tell me about this when?
- It’s fine.

179
00:17:57,054 --> 00:18:00,225
It’s not fine. No, it’s not.
What the hell? You don’t tell me?

180
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:04,394
I owe everybody money, Joe.
I owe everybody money.

181
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:10,098
I can’t get any shifts.
I ain’t got any cash.

182
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:15,408
I got it, I got it.

183
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,512
Screw them. I’ll tape it double.

184
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,214
Thanks.

185
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:28,355
Keep up. Stay up.

186
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:31,454
Keep moving, keep your legs moving.

187
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:35,857
Here comes Braddock
with his long-time manager, Joe Gould.

188
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:38,199
You’re washed up, Braddock!

189
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:42,138
- And now for our main event...
- Hey. Which one’s us, pal?

190
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,700
He’s up against Hymie Caplin’s
latest charge,

191
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:47,974
- young Abe Feldman from Schenectady.
- Six-rounder.

192
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:53,005
Some might recall that Braddock was
once a light-heavyweight title challenger.

193
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:55,112
His golden-boy peak ended

194
00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:00,214
when Tommy Loughran handled Jim
over 15 rounds back in ‘29.

195
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:02,353
Since then, the oft-injured Braddock

196
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,522
has shown only a glimmer
of his early promise.

197
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:11,295
And the losses have started to pile up.
But Braddock continues to battle.

198
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:14,135
And here comes the popular
Abe Feldman.

199
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:20,136
He looks to be the real thing and showed
real moxie in his recent win over Birkie.

200
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,178
- Who whipped Latzo?
- I did.

201
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:29,949
Goddamn right.
Who KO’d Slattery in the ninth

202
00:19:30,013 --> 00:19:33,957
when everybody said he didn’t have
a rainmaker’s chance in hell?

203
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:35,517
- That’d have to be me too.
- Right.

204
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:38,325
And we’re s’posed to pucker our assholes
over Feldman?

205
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,389
- The guy couldn’t break wind.
- No.

206
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:43,799
Jimmy, Jimmy. Jimmy.

207
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:46,737
- Any place else you’d rather be?
- No.

208
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:50,105
Good. Now what are you
gonna do about it?

209
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:55,342
Here we are halfway through the fifth
and it’s more of the same.

210
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:57,441
The boys clinch again.

211
00:19:57,508 --> 00:20:02,316
- He’s crushing my guy! Get him off!
- Break, break, break!

212
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:06,289
The boo-birds have started flying.
They want action from these fighters.

213
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:08,955
Feldman sticks a left in Braddock’s face.

214
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:11,690
Braddock’s right hand
is his best and only weapon.

215
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:14,699
He'll show the left but it lacks snap,
and Feldman knows it.

216
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:17,634
Give these yokels a shot in the ass!

217
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:21,331
Feldman ducks a haymaker,
but fails to follow up.

218
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:32,607
Another big right by Braddock.
There’s the Braddock we all recall.

219
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:36,484
But it’s one at a time.
It may not be enough.

220
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:39,048
Come on!

221
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:09,453
The referee pulls the boys apart,
and there’s the bell to end the fifth.

222
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:13,287
Easy now, easy. Easy, easy.

223
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,350
I saw that.

224
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:18,397
Bust it again? I’m calling it, Jim.

225
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:25,466
You gonna use the left? OK. Good.

226
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:29,700
You get in there, but don’t let him crowd
you. Work his belly, hammer his belly.

227
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:32,267
Last round. Come on,
you gotta show me something.

228
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:35,939
- You are giving me an ulcer, Harry!
- Shut up.

229
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:38,507
Work his belly with the left. You got it?

230
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:43,883
Give him the flapdoodle with the right,
because he don’t know. He’s kinda stupid.

231
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:47,357
Last round. Last round. Go get him!

232
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:50,122
The left! The left!

233
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,522
Damn it. I wish he could find
his goddamned left.

234
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:58,895
That’s it. Change it up.
Southpaw, that’s it!

235
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:01,701
Feldman prancing around,
looking for an opening.

236
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:04,300
But still few clean punches by the fighters.

237
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:09,506
Braddock still pawing away with the left.
Another ineffectual left from Feldman.

238
00:22:09,573 --> 00:22:13,381
Braddock can hardly lift his arms.
He’s slow on his feet.

239
00:22:13,443 --> 00:22:18,717
At least Gould in his corner is still
throwing punches, trying to urge his man on.

240
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,897
Go home!

241
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,700
No holds, Braddock.

242
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:36,037
Cavanaugh’s working harder
than the fighters.

243
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:37,736
Dry up!

244
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:46,304
Another clinch. It’s as if 80 tough fights
have finally jumped on Braddock’s back.

245
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:58,886
Cavanaugh pulls them apart. And he’s
called the fight. He’s called the fight.

246
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:05,232
It’s a no-contest. And the popcorn
and the peanuts are raining down.

247
00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:08,796
And I’m afraid to say
that’s all these fighters deserve

248
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:11,434
for the show they put on tonight.

249
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:19,072
It’s sad to see a fighter that was once the
caliber of James Braddock reduced to this.

250
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:22,709
It’s all right, Jimmy.
It’s all right, it’s all right.

251
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,882
An embarrassment, that’s what it was.

252
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:27,619
- An embarrassment!
- Where the hell’s the purse?

253
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:31,287
You wouldn’t have to be asking that
if you gave a shit about your fighter.

254
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:34,856
OK. OK. He’s fighting hurt.

255
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,269
Maybe you got fat and happy fighters
who can afford to rest between bouts.

256
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:43,864
- I don’t know. Lucky you.
- Christ, he hardly gets a punch in!

257
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:47,674
Fights being stopped by referees?
He’s pathetic!

258
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,976
Fights like that keep people away.

259
00:23:53,443 --> 00:23:56,182
We’re revoking his license, Joe.

260
00:23:56,246 --> 00:24:00,020
Whatever Braddock was gonna do
in boxing, I guess he’s done it.

261
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,152
Wait a minute.

262
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:04,595
That’s all.

263
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,059
Oh, boy.

264
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:17,468
Mr. Johnston!

265
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:21,139
Jim.

266
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:24,205
- What’s going on?
- You didn’t tell him?

267
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:27,718
Yeah, of course I told him.
He wanted to hear it from you.

268
00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:30,279
Come on, Mr. Johnston. No contest?

269
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:34,950
I broke my hand. OK? It’s legit.
You don’t see me crying about it.

270
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:40,992
I don’t see what you got to complain about.
I still put on a show. I did what I could do.

271
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:46,601
You know, we did that boondock circuit
for you - me and Joe. Remember?

272
00:24:47,597 --> 00:24:50,939
I didn’t quit on you.
And I didn’t quit tonight.

273
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,605
I didn’t always lose.
I won’t always lose again.

274
00:24:57,607 --> 00:24:59,812
- I can still fight.
- Go home.

275
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:03,377
- I can still fight.
- Go home to Mae and the kids, Jim.

276
00:25:04,948 --> 00:25:07,687
Go home? Go home with what?

277
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:10,195
Go home with what?

278
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:13,095
A broken hand from Mount Vernon?

279
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:16,294
Mr. Johnston!

280
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:52,264
Baby?

281
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:02,804
What happened?

282
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,715
I didn’t get the dough.

283
00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:08,447
They didn’t pay up.

284
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:13,117
They called it a no-contest,
said the fight was an embarrassment.

285
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:17,460
They decommissioned me.

286
00:26:20,357 --> 00:26:25,426
- Jimmy, what happened to your hand?
- It’s broken again in three places.

287
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:28,803
They said I’m through, Mae.
Said I can’t be a boxer no more.

288
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:30,775
Mercy.

289
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:37,711
OK.

290
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:47,321
Jimmy, if you can’t work, we’re not gonna
be able to pay the electric or the heat.

291
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:50,254
And...

292
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:56,130
we’re out of credit at the grocery, so...

293
00:26:57,093 --> 00:27:00,162
I think we need to pack the kids.

294
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:06,840
They could stay at my sister’s for a while,
and I’ll take in more sewing.

295
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:10,347
- Mae, I’ll get doubles, triples.
- We could make two breadlines a day.

296
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:12,908
- Jimmy, you can’t work.
- Mae, I can still work.

297
00:27:12,943 --> 00:27:15,682
Jimmy, you can’t work. Your hand’s broken.

298
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:23,091
They see me lugging this around, they
won’t pick me. Not the docks or anywhere.

299
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:27,827
So I’m gonna cover it up-
with the shoe polish.

300
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:31,762
OK?

301
00:27:57,687 --> 00:28:00,563
- I’m sorry.
- No.

302
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:07,829
No.

303
00:28:18,408 --> 00:28:19,908
No.

304
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,001
All right. Five, and only five.

305
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:48,139
One.

306
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:51,105
Two.

307
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,445
Three.

308
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:58,220
Four.

309
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,855
Five. That’s it.

310
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,135
- What the hell happened to your face?
- I got in a fight.

311
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:23,773
Yeah? What did you go and do that for?

312
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,618
That’s a good question.

313
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:30,053
Mike Wilson.

314
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:31,954
Jim Braddock.

315
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:35,857
Used to follow a pretty good
fighter with that name.

316
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,260
There’s some other guy going around
using that name now. Can’t fight for shit.

317
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:44,826
A gambling man’ll lose
a lot of money on him.

318
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:47,362
Twice.

319
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:55,176
Hey, that hand ain’t gonna work.

320
00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:57,545
You can’t slow me down. I need this job.

321
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:00,641
I need the job too.

322
00:30:09,185 --> 00:30:12,163
What’s wrong with the goddamn hand?

323
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:22,568
You see us falling behind, Jake?

324
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:26,608
He’s all right.

325
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:36,284
I appreciate it.

326
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:40,856
I’ll get a cold beer.

327
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:44,918
- Just a water for me, Quincy.
- All I got today, big spenders.

328
00:30:44,988 --> 00:30:47,364
Beer for him too. I’m buying.

329
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,202
Don’t hurt my feelings.

330
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,568
It’s been a while but...
you don’t have to twist my arm.

331
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,868
Yeah, I used to be a broker.
Still lost it all in ‘29.

332
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:02,073
Yeah, me too.

333
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:05,480
I had just about everything
I ever earned in stocks.

334
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:10,918
Even that taxi company. I mean, who
loses their dough on cabs in New York City?

335
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,015
Yeah. I thought that one was gold
for the grandkiddies.

336
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:18,892
You know there’s people living in shacks in
Central Park? They call it the Hooverville.

337
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:21,296
This governments dropped us flat.

338
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:24,801
We need to organize, you know?
Unionize, fight back.

339
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:30,439
Fight? Fight what?
Bad luck? Greed? Drought?

340
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:35,235
No point punching things you can’t see.
We’ll work our way through this.

341
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:38,283
- FDR, he’s gonna handle it.
- Screw FDR.

342
00:31:38,341 --> 00:31:40,751
FDR, Hoover, they’re all the same.

343
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,151
I come home one day,
I stand in my living room,

344
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:48,157
and between the mortgage and the market
and the lawyer meant to be working for me,

345
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:51,024
it stopped being mine.

346
00:31:51,054 --> 00:31:53,555
It all stopped being mine.

347
00:31:53,623 --> 00:31:57,033
FDR ain’t given me my house back yet.

348
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:05,133
Mama, why can’t I go to school?

349
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:07,941
Is it because I’m a girl?

350
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:11,448
Maybe. Hadn’t thought of that.

351
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:18,923
Who’s that man at our house?

352
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,121
Excuse me!

353
00:32:22,285 --> 00:32:24,490
Excuse me!

354
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:28,055
- Can I help you?
- I’m sorry, lady. You’re past due.

355
00:32:28,124 --> 00:32:30,625
No. No, you can’t.

356
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:32,898
You can’t. There’s kids.

357
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:36,168
If I don’t, they let me go.

358
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:39,039
- They already let two guys go.
- Please.

359
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:43,772
This apartment is what we got left
that keeps us hangin’ on.

360
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,716
Lady, I got kids too.

361
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:59,192
$6.74.

362
00:32:59,255 --> 00:33:01,960
How much to turn it back on?

363
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:05,403
Four months.

364
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,632
$44.12.

365
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:16,938
If I work 26 hours out of every 24,
it still won’t add up.

366
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:26,515
We ain’t got nothing. Nothing left to sell.

367
00:33:31,754 --> 00:33:34,925
All the guys you could’ve married.

368
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:39,869
Yeah. What happened to those guys?

369
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,894
It’s Howard.

370
00:34:03,953 --> 00:34:06,488
Since this afternoon.

371
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:16,766
Bless us, O Lord,

372
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:21,436
and these thy gifts which
we are about to receive from thy bounty.

373
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:26,710
Jim.

374
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:29,922
I’m all prayed out.

375
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:54,376
Where are you going?
I said where are you going?

376
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:58,009
Go ahead, you no-good bastard!

377
00:34:58,074 --> 00:35:00,984
Go on, then! We don’t need you!

378
00:35:01,044 --> 00:35:04,613
All right. Help me.
Pick up some of that wood.

379
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:07,557
- I got it, Mama.
- Let’s go, sweetheart.

380
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,632
Nice and warm.

381
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,099
Baby?

382
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:27,376
Baby?

383
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:29,938
Look at mommy.

384
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,981
Sweet Lord.

385
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:46,757
Mommy?

386
00:35:51,227 --> 00:35:53,898
What’s wrong?

387
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:57,238
Nothing, sweetheart.

388
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,176
Mommy will be right back, OK?

389
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,529
Howard’s fever was getting worse,

390
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:59,093
and then Rosy started to sneeze.

391
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:13,681
- Where are they, Mae?
- Jimmy, we can’t even keep ‘em warm.

392
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:17,554
Where are the kids?

393
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:21,887
The boys’ll sleep on the sofa at my
father’s. Rosy’ll stay at my sister’s.

394
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:23,622
Jimmy, we can’t keep ‘em.

395
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:26,323
You don’t make decisions
about our children without me.

396
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:29,367
What if they get really sick?
We already owe Dr. Macdonald...

397
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:31,766
If we send ‘em away,
then all this is for nothing.

398
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:34,067
- It’s just until...
- What else is it for?

399
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,937
If we can’t stay together,
we’ve lost, we’ve given up!

400
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:39,806
I am not giving up!
I am trying to protect our children!

401
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:42,574
Mae, I promised him.

402
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:44,945
Outside the butcher’s
I looked him in the eyes

403
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:49,247
and I promised him with all my heart
I would never, ever send him away.

404
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:54,523
- You can’t do this.
- You weren’t here.

405
00:37:55,284 --> 00:37:58,319
You can’t break my promise.

406
00:37:58,387 --> 00:38:02,490
Jim, you didn’t see. You weren’t here.

407
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:13,238
I’m sorry.

408
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:19,214
I’m sorry, Jimmy.

409
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:24,516
What are you doing?

410
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:30,490
Jim?

411
00:38:30,553 --> 00:38:32,792
Jimmy?

412
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,492
Where are you goin’?

413
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:38,229
Where are you goin’, Jimmy?

414
00:38:57,413 --> 00:39:00,152
That doesn’t qualify you, sir.
What else can you tell me?

415
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:02,523
My wife is losing all of her teeth.

416
00:39:02,585 --> 00:39:06,859
I got a relief order for her, and the doctor
says it’s due to insufficient diet.

417
00:39:06,923 --> 00:39:11,695
She’s still nursing the baby on account
of we can’t afford milk for the family.

418
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:25,713
I never thought I’d see you here, Jim.

419
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:31,310
I want none of my fighters
going up against John Henry Lewis.

420
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:34,784
None of ‘em. This guy’s an animal.

421
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:41,049
Well, I gotta tell you, he jumped up,
kicked his stool out of the ring.

422
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:45,459
He was furious.
He started to holler. I grabbed the mike...

423
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:53,768
There’s Jimmy Braddock.

424
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:03,944
The thing is, I can’t afford to...

425
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:06,177
I can’t afford to pay the heat.

426
00:41:06,242 --> 00:41:08,549
I’ve had to farm out my kids.

427
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:11,856
They keep cutting shifts down at the docks.

428
00:41:11,914 --> 00:41:14,892
You just don’t get picked every day.

429
00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:21,361
I sold everything I got
to anybody who would buy.

430
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:32,964
I went on public assistance. I signed on at
the relief office. They gave me 19 dollars.

431
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:38,936
I need another 18 dollars and 38 cents so
I can pay the bill and get the kids back.

432
00:41:42,511 --> 00:41:47,546
You know me well enough to know
if I had anywhere else to go,

433
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,991
I wouldn’t be here.

434
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:58,428
If you could help me through this time,
I sure would be grateful.

435
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:11,880
Sure, Jim. Sure.

436
00:42:18,748 --> 00:42:21,021
Good luck.

437
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:22,822
Jim.

438
00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:29,260
Jimmy.

439
00:42:57,353 --> 00:42:59,524
Here you go, Jim.

440
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:02,925
Good luck, Jim.

441
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:27,687
I’m sorry, Joe.
I didn’t... I’m sorry.

442
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:31,752
What in the hell
do you have to be sorry about?

443
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:33,924
Jesus Christ, Jim.

444
00:43:40,896 --> 00:43:43,567
How short are you?

445
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:56,717
About a dollar fifty.

446
00:43:58,914 --> 00:44:00,085
OK.

447
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,728
- We’re home! We’re home!
- We’re finally home!

448
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,561
Good.

449
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:20,474
Hey, all right.

450
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,946
Howard, don’t jump on the bed.

451
00:44:23,005 --> 00:44:26,540
Sorry, Mom. Read to me, Jay.

452
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:28,678
On his way up and down the stair,

453
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:32,915
he often paused to sniff,
but he never asked for anything...

454
00:44:37,186 --> 00:44:40,793
Happy birthday to you

455
00:44:41,194 --> 00:44:44,294
Happy birthday to you

456
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,036
- Happy birthday, dear Howard
- Junior!

457
00:44:49,098 --> 00:44:51,042
- Sarah!
- Jean!

458
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,010
Happy birthday to you

459
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,377
- Make a wish, kids.
- Blow!

460
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:06,453
Howard, come on. They’re gonna
cut the cake up. You gotta line up.

461
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:11,152
- Looking forward to some chocolate cake?
- I liked it better when we had our own.

462
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,993
I can understand that.

463
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:18,469
- Hiya, Howard.
- Hi.

464
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:21,939
Did your dad ever tell you
I used to spar with him?

465
00:45:21,997 --> 00:45:25,202
- You hit the Father?
- As often as I possibly could.

466
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:27,643
He was kind of tricky, though.
Hard to catch.

467
00:45:27,703 --> 00:45:29,613
Go and get some cake. Go on.

468
00:45:30,706 --> 00:45:33,207
Missed you at Mass, Jimmy.

469
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:36,117
I can get an extra shift on a Sunday.

470
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:38,951
- James.
- Excuse me.

471
00:45:39,014 --> 00:45:42,356
Every day, fix the world.
How about fixing your family?

472
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:46,885
What kind of father’s too proud to cross the
street ‘cause she can’t have her own cake?

473
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:49,262
You’re drunk at church, for Christ’s sake.

474
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:52,792
- Is that a joke, Sara?
- I’m just saying it’s enough!

475
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:56,737
- Hey, guys, where’s the ref?
- Stay out of it. It’s between man and wife.

476
00:45:56,799 --> 00:46:00,107
- How do you even call yourself that?
- What’d you say to me?

477
00:46:00,169 --> 00:46:02,545
- Get off me.
- A couple of drinks, no harm in that.

478
00:46:02,604 --> 00:46:05,980
All washed up, can’t get a fight.
Well, you wanna fight me?

479
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:08,280
Don’t do this. I ain’t got no beef with you.

480
00:46:08,344 --> 00:46:11,447
Come on! Can’t make it in the ring?

481
00:46:11,513 --> 00:46:14,423
Come on, Braddock!
I could take your head off. Come on!

482
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:16,984
Jim, no!

483
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:20,689
- You OK, baby? You OK?
- Get off me.

484
00:46:20,756 --> 00:46:23,495
Go to hell. The both of you.

485
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:25,900
Jesus, Jim. He wasn’t gonna hit me.

486
00:46:28,063 --> 00:46:30,507
Mike! Wait!

487
00:46:40,776 --> 00:46:44,220
What it’s all about is
rotating your body behind your fist. Bang.

488
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:46,450
That’s right. Right in the kisser, yeah.

489
00:46:46,548 --> 00:46:48,287
Boom.

490
00:46:48,317 --> 00:46:50,295
There you go. Yeah.

491
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:53,296
There you go. Good girl.

492
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:55,799
You got a better jab than your dad.

493
00:46:57,226 --> 00:47:01,193
- Boy, you are a brave man.
- Not really. Mae’s at the store.

494
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:06,005
- That’s a good one, kiddo.
- Wanna go play while I talk to Uncle Joe?

495
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:11,145
Joe Gould.

496
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:16,275
- Still looking dapper, I see.
- Certainly. Gotta keep up appearances.

497
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,182
- Good to see you, Jimmy.
- Nice to see you, Joe.

498
00:47:21,116 --> 00:47:23,560
Well, nice day.

499
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:25,790
Yeah.

500
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:30,098
You drove all the way out here
to talk about the weather?

501
00:47:30,526 --> 00:47:34,493
Maybe I was in the neighborhood.
You ever think of that? A little fresh air.

502
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:37,905
Joe, this is Jersey.

503
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:41,743
Yeah. Good point. Yeah.

504
00:47:43,105 --> 00:47:44,878
Good point.

505
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:48,151
I got you a fight.

506
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,847
- Go to hell.
- Come on. You want it, don’t you?

507
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:53,254
Are we gonna tell
the Boxing Commission or not?

508
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:56,725
Yes. And they’ll sanction it.
This one fight and one fight only.

509
00:47:56,785 --> 00:48:01,025
- It’s not a comeback. It’s just one fight.
- Why?

510
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,897
- ‘Cause of who you’re fighting.
- How much?

511
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:06,232
- Just ask me who you’re fighting.
- How much?

512
00:48:06,295 --> 00:48:10,603
250 dollars. You’re on at the big show
at the Garden tomorrow night.

513
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:15,201
You fight Corn Griffin, Jimmy. Number two
heavyweight contender in the world.

514
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,475
- Prelim before the championship bout.
- Joe, this ain’t funny.

515
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:23,746
No, it’s not. And it ain’t no favor either.
Griffin’s opponent got cut and can’t fight.

516
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:28,620
We had to find somebody they could throw
in at a day’s notice. Nobody legit would...

517
00:48:30,652 --> 00:48:33,857
Nobody would take a fight with Griffin
without training.

518
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,659
So I told them...

519
00:48:36,725 --> 00:48:41,669
use the angle Griffin’s gonna knock
out a guy who’s never been knocked out.

520
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,901
You’re meat, Jimmy.

521
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:46,876
- Are you on the level, Joe?
- Come on. Always.

522
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:51,337
- For 250 dollars, I would fight your wife.
- Now you’re dreaming.

523
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:53,782
- And your grandmother.
- Teeth in or teeth out?

524
00:48:53,842 --> 00:48:56,377
- Take ‘em out.
- Then you’re dead. Down, gone.

525
00:48:56,445 --> 00:48:59,446
- 250 bucks?
- 250 bananas. Come here.

526
00:49:03,085 --> 00:49:05,461
Programs here.

527
00:49:06,788 --> 00:49:10,994
Programs here.
45 cents. Programs here.

528
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:13,003
I mean, for Christ’s sake.

529
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:15,766
A hundred and something fights,
you never been knocked out.

530
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:18,332
Who the hell
goes and sells his gear?

531
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:21,277
80 fights as a pro, 50 as an amateur.

532
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:24,075
How soon they forget.
I’m so sorry.

533
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:28,379
Borrowed gear, borrowed robe.
Knock yourself out.

534
00:49:29,378 --> 00:49:31,879
Hey, Joe.

535
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:39,027
You know, I might as well get an
Aooga horn and chase him round the ring.

536
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:41,595
That’s good.

537
00:49:41,657 --> 00:49:44,601
- You been drinking?
- Are you trying to hurt my feelings?

538
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:48,127
Well, you’re just too loose.
You’re spooking me. Sharpen up.

539
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:51,368
Come on, Joe.
We both know what this is, right?

540
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:55,801
I get to put a little more distance
between my kids and the street

541
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:59,576
and I get to say goodbye at the Garden.

542
00:50:00,576 --> 00:50:02,713
Full house, night of a big fight.

543
00:50:03,645 --> 00:50:05,748
Thank you very much.

544
00:50:05,814 --> 00:50:07,814
Right, come on. Hurry up.

545
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:10,088
Let’s get the lead out here.

546
00:50:12,654 --> 00:50:15,393
What the hell was that?

547
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,958
- They ran out of soup on the line.
- Ran out of soup on the line?

548
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:22,828
How the hell are you supposed to fight
on an empty stomach?

549
00:50:23,258 --> 00:50:24,792
Good evening.

550
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:29,803
Welcome to tonight’s broadcast
of the Primo Camera/Max Baer fight

551
00:50:29,864 --> 00:50:32,637
for the heavyweight championship
of the world.

552
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,041
Hash is all they had, OK?

553
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:37,604
- Eat. Quick.
- You got a spoon?

554
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:40,481
For Christ’s sake. It’s not there?
We gotta go anyway.

555
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:43,918
- One bite, Joe. I’ll eat it with my fingers.
- Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!

556
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:49,150
I don’t have time to retape you.
Just sit tight and I’ll find you a spoon.

557
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:52,256
For Christ’s sake.

558
00:51:03,465 --> 00:51:05,966
Is that a ghost I’m seeing?
An apparition?

559
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:09,774
Or is that James J. Braddock,
the Bulldog of Bergen?

560
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:12,111
How you feeling, Jimmy?
How’s that right hand?

561
00:51:12,173 --> 00:51:14,674
Braddock, you’re up.

562
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:22,787
- Sporty Lewis. How you doing?
- How you doing?

563
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:27,688
July 18, 1929.

564
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:30,228
New York Herald.

565
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:34,760
Proving he was too young and too green

566
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:37,034
and rushed to the top,

567
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:41,306
Loughran wiped the ring
with the Bulldog’s career.

568
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:44,245
A sad and somber funeral,

569
00:51:44,305 --> 00:51:47,306
with the body still breathing.

570
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:50,318
I don’t fight the fights, Jimmy.
I just write about ‘em.

571
00:51:50,345 --> 00:51:54,016
Sporty, save the crap for the customers.

572
00:52:04,893 --> 00:52:08,894
- Who’s Jim Braddock?
- Get your pencil out. I got your lead line.

573
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:11,736
I’m not kidding. Write this down.

574
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:17,769
The walk from the locker room to the ring
was the only time tonight Jim Braddock...

575
00:52:17,939 --> 00:52:21,849
- Looking good, Jimmy!
- was seen on his feet. You got that?

576
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:25,252
Before the championship baffle,
we’ll bring you a special bout,

577
00:52:25,313 --> 00:52:28,882
featuring Charlie Harvey’s
soldier boy, Corn Griffin.

578
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,087
Griffin is the fella that ran rings
around the champion Camera in training.

579
00:52:33,154 --> 00:52:37,291
His opponent? Looks like they dug
old Jim Braddock out of retirement

580
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:39,358
for one more fight.

581
00:52:39,427 --> 00:52:40,927
Mike.

582
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:43,098
- What?
- Isn’t that your buddy?

583
00:52:44,098 --> 00:52:46,599
In this corner...

584
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:53,711
the sensational heavyweight slugger
from Fort Benning, Georgia,

585
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:58,050
who’s punching a path to
the top of the division,

586
00:52:58,112 --> 00:53:00,954
John Corn Griffin.

587
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:03,627
Corn Griffin.

588
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:08,759
His opponent, the popular battler

589
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:13,631
who has never been KO’d
in more than 80 professional bouts...

590
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:16,105
- Quincy, beer. We got a fight.
- Coming right up.

591
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:19,108
...from North Bergen, New Jersey,

592
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:21,440
James J. Braddock.

593
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:25,141
Braddock!

594
00:53:29,077 --> 00:53:30,077
Yeah!

595
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:51,669
The skinny from ringside
is that Braddock won’t last two rounds.

596
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:54,040
Griffin is the five-to-one favorite.

597
00:53:54,102 --> 00:53:56,671
Joe Gould claims
Braddock’s right hand is fine.

598
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:58,773
Jimmy will need two good hands tonight.

599
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:08,387
Griffin storms out of his corner.
Things are up-tempo right away.

600
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:13,356
Come on, Braddock. Make a fight of it.

601
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:22,673
Get out of it, Jimmy!

602
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:26,436
Braddock takes a left to the body
and a right to the head.

603
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:28,877
Braddock giving ground now.

604
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:33,641
Get out of there, Jimmy!

605
00:54:39,047 --> 00:54:43,048
- And Braddock is down!
- Shut up. I wanna hear this. Shut up.

606
00:54:43,117 --> 00:54:47,254
Jim? You’re fine, you’re fine, you’re fine.
Stay down. Stay down.

607
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:59,101
- One. Two.
- Stay down. What’s the hurry?

608
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:02,736
- Three.
- Hey, listen! Work the left. Try two lefts.

609
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:05,544
Give him two lefts. Pop, pop.

610
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:07,413
- Double it up.
- Seven.

611
00:55:07,475 --> 00:55:11,010
- Up, up, up, up. Let’s go.
- Eight. Nine.

612
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,750
- Braddock, up at nine.
- Yeah! Come on, Jimmy!

613
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:16,956
Referee waving Griffin in.

614
00:55:18,286 --> 00:55:21,093
Move in on that! Nice move!

615
00:55:27,395 --> 00:55:30,032
Welcome to New York.

616
00:55:31,733 --> 00:55:34,234
That’s more like it. Let me see that cut.

617
00:55:34,302 --> 00:55:36,337
You look great.

618
00:55:36,404 --> 00:55:38,973
It sure as hell beats working on the docks.

619
00:55:40,842 --> 00:55:46,743
Say, the two jabs look sensational, they
look sweet! He’s loading up on you, see?

620
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:50,153
He opens up after you jab,
and you gotta come in with the right.

621
00:55:50,218 --> 00:55:52,253
Real quick. Pop, pop. Bang.

622
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,559
But you gotta stop
some of those left hands.

623
00:55:55,623 --> 00:55:57,896
See any gettin’ past my head?

624
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:59,959
Keep moving. Pop, pop, bang.

625
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:07,567
Griffin is still winging big shots.
He wants to be the first to stop Braddock.

626
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:14,976
Another big right hand.
Snapped Griffin’s head back with that one.

627
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,913
Griffin loading up.

628
00:56:21,015 --> 00:56:24,220
- Move out!
- Another big flurry by Griffin.

629
00:56:24,285 --> 00:56:29,525
Braddock hanging tough.
But, folks, he is taking a beating.

630
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:33,827
That’s two rounds more
than I thought he was gonna go.

631
00:56:33,895 --> 00:56:37,237
He’s a half a step behind you.
Do you feel that? Pop, pop, bang.

632
00:56:37,298 --> 00:56:40,867
- Stick with it. Stick with it.
- Busy, busy.

633
00:56:42,403 --> 00:56:45,176
Six minutes of fury so far.

634
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:49,308
Braddock has the look of a man
trying to hold back an avalanche.

635
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:55,989
Griffin cuts him with the left.
Braddock is stepping in postholes.

636
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:58,892
Keep him in front of you!

637
00:57:00,922 --> 00:57:02,593
Lure him in, Jim.

638
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:05,294
Jimmy’s finally moving his head.

639
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:07,696
Pick your spot.

640
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,069
Pop, pop - now!

641
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:18,375
Griffin is down!

642
00:57:23,578 --> 00:57:26,488
Where the hell have you been,
Jimmy Braddock?

643
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:30,184
One. Two. Three.

644
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:34,320
He’s up at three.
The referee wipes his gloves.

645
00:57:41,229 --> 00:57:44,332
That’s it! That’s it! No daylight!

646
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:46,503
Take it to him!

647
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:50,375
- Another big right by Braddock.
- Finish him, Jim!

648
00:57:57,211 --> 00:57:59,950
Knock him back to the goddamn Ozarks!

649
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,751
Griffin is ready to go!

650
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:07,822
Break it up.

651
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:09,458
Get back.

652
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:13,959
Get back to your corner.

653
00:58:17,365 --> 00:58:19,036
Jimmy!

654
00:58:21,936 --> 00:58:24,709
This fight is over! This is incredible!

655
00:58:24,772 --> 00:58:27,773
Corn Griffin,
the number two contender in the world

656
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:31,616
has just been knocked out
by Jim Braddock in the third round.

657
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,020
- What an upset!
- You son of a...!

658
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:37,423
It’s pandemonium here in the Garden.

659
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:47,226
Settle down, for Christ’s sake!

660
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:51,401
Jesus H. Christ.

661
00:58:51,465 --> 00:58:54,238
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

662
00:58:54,302 --> 00:58:58,905
Mary Magdalene, all the saints
and mothers and... Jesus!

663
00:58:58,973 --> 00:59:03,110
Did I say Jesus?
Where the hell did that come from?

664
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:06,985
When my hand was broken, I had to work
down the docks and I had to use my left.

665
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:10,515
- So... Well, no, that and luck.
- Luck?

666
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:14,187
- Sheer, dumb-ass Irish luck.
- Don’t give me that luck of the Irish crap.

667
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:17,631
Lucky? That’s something you ain’t been
in a long time, brother.

668
00:59:17,692 --> 00:59:19,863
- Everybody’s due.
- Due or not, I’ll take it.

669
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:22,928
You had the left.
The left - but you were bouncy.

670
00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:25,498
You were bouncy.
You went: pop, pop, bang!

671
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:26,771
Pop, pop, bang!

672
00:59:26,834 --> 00:59:29,244
Unbelievable. Pop, pop, slide.

673
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:32,940
- Sliding, slipping. You were like a cat.
- I did that on hash.

674
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:37,883
Imagine what I would’ve done to him
if I’d had a couple of steaks.

675
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:40,616
Jimmy?

676
00:59:40,681 --> 00:59:43,057
That was one hell of a goodbye.

677
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:51,724
Here you go, fellas.

678
01:00:22,323 --> 01:00:24,562
Jesus Christ.

679
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:30,432
Murder him, Maxie!

680
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:38,606
This is fighting? Why doesn’t he
just hit him with a goddamn chair?

681
01:00:41,008 --> 01:00:43,509
Griffin was supposed to fight Baer next.

682
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:47,045
He should kiss your ass
for saving him from that thing.

683
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:10,572
Throw him down, Maxie!

684
01:01:10,638 --> 01:01:12,979
Give it to him, Maxie!

685
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:31,560
Ladies and gentlemen, the new
heavyweight champion of the world -

686
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,898
Max Baer!

687
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,450
Come on. He’s home.

688
01:02:16,303 --> 01:02:18,303
I won.

689
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:23,110
I knew you’d win!

690
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:27,282
- I knew you’d win!
- You won, you won, you won!

691
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:33,192
Get the silverware.

692
01:02:33,254 --> 01:02:38,323
So, was it like you said?
Or are they letting you back in?

693
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:43,235
No, baby. It was just one fight.

694
01:02:56,343 --> 01:03:00,810
- Jake! Jake!
- I need seven men, and seven only.

695
01:03:00,881 --> 01:03:03,882
One. Two.

696
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:06,054
Three.

697
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,766
Four. Five.

698
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:16,771
Thanks.

699
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,637
Braddock!

700
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:28,543
Listened in last night. Was that really you?

701
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:33,354
- Yeah.
- Didn’t think I’d be seeing you back here.

702
01:03:33,414 --> 01:03:36,756
It came up at the last minute, you know?
It was a one-fight deal.

703
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:40,693
The purse was $250. My end of that
was a little less than half. It was $123.

704
01:03:40,754 --> 01:03:43,425
We owed $118. Left me with five bucks.

705
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:46,161
- Makes you a rich man.
- Around here.

706
01:03:46,227 --> 01:03:48,728
- Good fight.
- Thanks.

707
01:03:48,796 --> 01:03:50,296
- Dock seven.
- Seven.

708
01:03:56,537 --> 01:03:59,379
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Mike.

709
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:06,248
- Good fight.
- Thanks.

710
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:14,523
- I wouldn’t have hit Sara.
- I know, Mike.

711
01:04:14,588 --> 01:04:18,532
I couldn’t live with myself
if I’d have hit her.

712
01:04:19,326 --> 01:04:22,463
I just get so angry with all this shit.

713
01:04:25,332 --> 01:04:29,299
You know, if you were gonna win,
you could’ve told me.

714
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:32,246
If I knew I was gonna win,
I would’ve bet on myself.

715
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:36,409
- Why can’t you ever listen to me, huh?
- I don’t know.

716
01:04:36,477 --> 01:04:41,717
...to determine whether the strikers
were willing to submit to arbitration...

717
01:04:46,287 --> 01:04:49,890
Why don’t you go play with the boys,
sweetheart? Be careful.

718
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:53,830
- Hey, Rosy.
- Hi, Daddy.

719
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:57,236
Beep beep! Vroom, vroom.

720
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:02,743
You know, Joe Gould was just here.

721
01:05:02,803 --> 01:05:04,906
- Yeah, I saw him.
- You did?

722
01:05:07,274 --> 01:05:13,741
He thinks the commission might be
willing to reverse their ruling.

723
01:05:13,814 --> 01:05:16,553
He thinks he can get me another fight.

724
01:05:16,617 --> 01:05:20,152
He wants me to stop working
and get back in shape.

725
01:05:21,155 --> 01:05:24,292
I thought it was just the one fight.

726
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:26,461
Well, yeah.

727
01:05:29,797 --> 01:05:33,798
He fronted us 175 dollars so I can train.

728
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:39,979
Know what that is right there?
That’s a second chance.

729
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:43,475
That’s what that is.

730
01:05:46,046 --> 01:05:48,319
It’s not that I’m not grateful,

731
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:50,985
or proud.

732
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:54,052
I am. I’m so proud of you.

733
01:05:55,556 --> 01:05:58,659
But we got off easy
when you broke that hand.

734
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,763
We’re back to even now.

735
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:04,568
And nine months from now
we’ll be back in the same boat.

736
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:08,075
Baby, please.
We just don’t have anything left to risk.

737
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:10,408
Hey, hey.

738
01:06:11,472 --> 01:06:15,007
There’s still some juice in these legs
and I can still take a few.

739
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:17,610
Baby, please.

740
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:21,320
Just let me take ‘em in the ring.

741
01:06:21,382 --> 01:06:24,224
At least I’d know who was hitting me.

742
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,771
I’m gonna go tell the kids.

743
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:46,041
- Jay. Guess what.
- What?

744
01:06:46,106 --> 01:06:48,675
- I got another fight.
- Who with?

745
01:06:48,742 --> 01:06:53,243
I don’t know, but he’s goin’ down.
Hey, Howard!

746
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,392
Jesus.

747
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:36,126
Joe, open the door.

748
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:40,435
Joe, open the damn door.

749
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:42,995
Don’t hide in your fancy apartment.

750
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:45,768
I want to talk to you.

751
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:49,743
You are not gonna make my husband
your punching bag all over again.

752
01:07:49,803 --> 01:07:54,872
We are just gettin’ by and you take him
from his work like a bloodsucking leech.

753
01:07:54,942 --> 01:08:00,080
And I will not let you get him hurt again like that.
Do you hear me? I will not let you.

754
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:06,085
I guess you’d better come in.

755
01:08:17,231 --> 01:08:20,732
- How is it?
- Too sweet. Per usual.

756
01:08:20,801 --> 01:08:22,938
Really? Go figure.

757
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:25,938
- Yours?
- Nice, thanks.

758
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:30,376
Sorry about that.

759
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:35,646
Just don’t want folks
to see you down, that’s all.

760
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:37,921
I didn’t know. I mean, I thought that...

761
01:08:37,985 --> 01:08:40,258
Yeah. That’s the idea.

762
01:08:41,188 --> 01:08:44,030
Always keep your hands up.

763
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:48,061
So...

764
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:54,097
Sold the last of it two days ago-
so Jimmy could train.

765
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:57,440
Why?

766
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,479
Well...

767
01:09:02,543 --> 01:09:05,248
Sometimes you have an instinct, Mae.

768
01:09:05,746 --> 01:09:08,985
You see something in a fighter.

769
01:09:10,517 --> 01:09:14,461
You don’t even know if it’s real,
you’re looking for it so bad.

770
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:24,469
Can’t have no hope at all.

771
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:28,441
But this is crazy. I mean, you don’t even
know if you can get him a fight.

772
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:32,878
I’ll get him a fight. Believe me, if it’s
the last thing I do, I’ll get him a fight.

773
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,816
Honey. Go get us
some of those crackers, would you?

774
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:41,253
She looks good wearing the pants.

775
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:59,338
Can you ever stop yours?
When he sets his mind to a thing?

776
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:05,640
I wish I could.

777
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:11,216
See, I never know
who it’s harder on - them or us.

778
01:10:11,912 --> 01:10:15,481
We have to wait for them to fix everything.

779
01:10:17,084 --> 01:10:19,425
And every day...

780
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:23,965
they feel like they’re failing us.

781
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:29,365
Really, it’s just the world that’s failed,
you know.

782
01:10:34,368 --> 01:10:36,971
It’s a lovely apartment.

783
01:10:37,971 --> 01:10:39,971
Thank you.

784
01:10:42,142 --> 01:10:44,483
Now, what am I gonna go and do that for?

785
01:10:44,544 --> 01:10:49,147
You saw the papers. The News had to print
extra copies the day after Braddock’s fight.

786
01:10:49,216 --> 01:10:52,455
People are sentimental.
Some people are sentimental.

787
01:10:52,552 --> 01:10:55,655
Yeah? So tell me why I care.

788
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:58,963
You’re still sore over the way
Braddock took down Griffin, fine.

789
01:10:59,026 --> 01:11:02,027
It was a heartbreak-
for a lot of people, yes.

790
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:04,402
But look.

791
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,342
You got an elimination series over who
gets a shot at Baer for the championship.

792
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:15,009
John Henry Lewis,
he’s your number two in line.

793
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:19,144
Now, he already defeated Braddock
once in Frisco, correct?

794
01:11:19,212 --> 01:11:22,156
Say you put Braddock
back in the game against Lewis.

795
01:11:22,215 --> 01:11:24,784
Lewis wins, you get
your revenge on Braddock,

796
01:11:24,851 --> 01:11:28,693
and your boy gets a topflight tune-up
with full publicity before Lasky.

797
01:11:28,755 --> 01:11:31,096
And what happens? You make more money.

798
01:11:34,594 --> 01:11:38,561
Now, say on the other hand,
by some minute, infinitesimal chance,

799
01:11:38,632 --> 01:11:40,769
God forbid, Braddock beats Lewis,

800
01:11:40,834 --> 01:11:43,573
you got an old favorite
go up and lose against Lasky.

801
01:11:43,637 --> 01:11:46,876
And what happens?
You’ll make more money.

802
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:52,544
James! Either way you’re a richer man with
Braddock back in the ring than if he’s not.

803
01:11:52,612 --> 01:11:56,681
Come on. Don’t be foolish.
We both know the name of this game.

804
01:11:57,684 --> 01:11:59,957
And it sure as hell ain’t pugilism.

805
01:12:12,232 --> 01:12:15,005
They oughta put your mouth in a circus.

806
01:12:16,002 --> 01:12:18,275
What do you say?

807
01:12:19,306 --> 01:12:22,648
Don’t chase him.
Go around. Cut him off.

808
01:12:22,709 --> 01:12:24,709
Time!

809
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:27,982
- I got you a fight.
- Who?

810
01:12:28,048 --> 01:12:31,253
You’re gonna fight
John Henry Lewis again.

811
01:12:31,318 --> 01:12:35,421
- Joey! I could kiss you.
- Please, not in front of the fellas.

812
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:39,797
- Ain’t John Henry one of Johnston’s boys?
- You let me worry about that, please.

813
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,634
Now I know why you won’t kiss me.
You’re all puckered out already.

814
01:12:43,697 --> 01:12:48,505
- Brother, you have no idea.
- Lewis? Kicked our ass in Frisco.

815
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:53,740
- Who’s this? Who’s our ass up here?
- Joe Gould, Mike Wilson. Mike, Joe.

816
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:56,080
That guy ain’t been beat in ten fights.

817
01:12:56,143 --> 01:12:59,553
But you win on a long shot
and that’s a great payday for me.

818
01:13:00,113 --> 01:13:02,216
- That’s great.
- I’ll keep that in mind.

819
01:13:02,282 --> 01:13:05,817
You got more important things
to think about. Come here.

820
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:10,796
Now, I ain’t gonna bullshit you, all right?
You win one, I can get you another.

821
01:13:10,857 --> 01:13:15,631
Win again, and then things maybe
start getting serious around here.

822
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:17,502
Jimmy...

823
01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:20,565
Win.

824
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:41,689
That’s it.

825
01:13:50,096 --> 01:13:54,768
That’s it, James. Be a bully, James.
Aggression. That’s it.

826
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:18,260
Thanks.

827
01:14:20,327 --> 01:14:22,771
I know this isn’t what you wanted,

828
01:14:22,829 --> 01:14:25,739
but I can’t win without you behind me.

829
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:28,743
I’m always behind you.

830
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:30,905
Thank you, baby.

831
01:14:32,772 --> 01:14:35,477
I got a great idea.
Want to come along?

832
01:14:35,542 --> 01:14:38,043
Come on. Just this once?
All right, all right.

833
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:41,680
OK, OK.
I’ll make that a rain check, then.

834
01:15:09,242 --> 01:15:11,811
Lewis still moving well here in the fourth.

835
01:15:12,512 --> 01:15:15,183
He dances in and out
before Braddock can react.

836
01:15:18,518 --> 01:15:21,689
Don’t let him set the pace, Jimmy.

837
01:15:23,723 --> 01:15:25,860
There you go, there you go.

838
01:15:28,461 --> 01:15:32,030
Braddock slides to his right,
tries cutting down the ring.

839
01:15:41,508 --> 01:15:44,009
- Knock him out, knock him out.
- Braddock!

840
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:49,284
Lewis spins his way up the ropes
and looks to resume control at the bell.

841
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:55,361
There we go. Suck it up, suck it up.
Deep breath, deep breath.

842
01:15:55,422 --> 01:15:58,866
- Breathe, breathe.
- He’s even faster than I remember.

843
01:15:58,925 --> 01:16:02,028
Yeah, yeah. He’s fast.
Big deal. You’re not so bad yourself.

844
01:16:02,095 --> 01:16:04,664
What are you doin’?
You beat this guy easy last time.

845
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:06,072
He ain’t the same guy.

846
01:16:06,132 --> 01:16:09,303
Use your speed. Keep that jab
in his face and slide to his right.

847
01:16:09,369 --> 01:16:12,506
You see that? Keep him in front of you,
cut him off. Right?

848
01:16:12,572 --> 01:16:15,743
And let go with the punches.
Hit him. He ain’t gonna like it.

849
01:16:15,809 --> 01:16:20,276
I guarantee you, the more you hit
this bastard, the slower he’s gonna get.

850
01:16:20,347 --> 01:16:22,984
He’s an old man, he’s slow.
He can’t keep up with you.

851
01:16:23,049 --> 01:16:25,152
- How’s that cut?
- He’s all right.

852
01:16:25,218 --> 01:16:28,958
Knock the legs out from under him.
Trap him in the corner and work him.

853
01:16:29,022 --> 01:16:33,091
Do not fight this fight his way.
You make him fight this fight your way.

854
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:35,830
Let’s go. You got him, you got him.

855
01:16:38,231 --> 01:16:40,231
A left to the body, a right to the head.

856
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:46,176
A left-right-left by Lewis. His dancing
shoes are off. It’s a fight now, folks.

857
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:50,316
- Work his body!
- Punching well with both hands now.

858
01:16:50,377 --> 01:16:53,548
Toe-to-toe. No one giving an inch.

859
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:58,422
That left has some pop!

860
01:16:58,485 --> 01:17:01,952
Jimmy’s hoping those body shots
will pay dividends.

861
01:17:02,022 --> 01:17:04,398
Keep him in there! Stay with it!

862
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:08,933
Don’t give him any room. No room!

863
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:13,271
- Outta the corner!
- Braddock pushing all the action now.

864
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:17,175
Lewis can’t discourage him.
Tremendous pressure from Jimmy.

865
01:17:17,237 --> 01:17:21,113
Lewis is running out of real estate
in this 24-foot ring.

866
01:17:21,174 --> 01:17:23,743
Jump on him!

867
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,617
And Lewis is down.

868
01:17:29,516 --> 01:17:31,426
Gotcha. Good boy.

869
01:17:33,853 --> 01:17:35,990
- One.
- Getup.

870
01:17:36,056 --> 01:17:37,761
- Two.
- Come on. Come on.

871
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:40,325
Three.

872
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,531
Four.

873
01:17:42,595 --> 01:17:44,971
Five.

874
01:17:45,031 --> 01:17:47,304
Six.

875
01:17:50,537 --> 01:17:53,208
The referee wipes his gloves.
Braddock steams back in.

876
01:17:53,273 --> 01:17:55,649
Close it down!

877
01:17:55,708 --> 01:18:01,243
A big right by Braddock. Lewis is a piece
of meat and Braddock is carving him up.

878
01:18:02,782 --> 01:18:07,192
Braddock is now dominating Lewis.
Here comes Jimmy!

879
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,575
Side to side. Side to side.

880
01:18:21,634 --> 01:18:25,840
In the tenth, riding high after his
dazzling victory over John Henry Lewis,

881
01:18:25,905 --> 01:18:29,508
Jim Braddock has just hit a wall
named Art Lasky.

882
01:18:32,145 --> 01:18:37,680
- He can’t keep taking those body shots.
- He’s cracked a couple of ribs for sure.

883
01:18:38,785 --> 01:18:42,525
Lasky walks through those jabs
and keeps working on Braddock’s body.

884
01:18:42,589 --> 01:18:48,034
Braddock won’t fold. He’s making Lasky
work hard for every minute of every round.

885
01:18:48,094 --> 01:18:50,867
That’s it. Get on him.

886
01:19:02,408 --> 01:19:04,784
Lasky’s starting to impose his will,

887
01:19:04,844 --> 01:19:09,845
showing why Johnston is making noises
about matching him with Baer for the title.

888
01:19:13,853 --> 01:19:16,263
Break it up.

889
01:19:17,223 --> 01:19:19,564
Break clean.

890
01:19:26,966 --> 01:19:29,171
Don’t sit down. You’re not tired.
You’re fine.

891
01:19:29,235 --> 01:19:31,576
Get that thing outta here.
He don’t need it.

892
01:19:32,005 --> 01:19:34,983
Is he looking over?
Shake your head like you don’t need it.

893
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:37,985
Shake your head
like you don’t want it. Yeah.

894
01:19:38,044 --> 01:19:40,920
- Why isn’t he sittin’ down?
- Pay attention.

895
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,924
Now he’ll wonder: If Braddock is
such an old man, why’s he still standing?

896
01:19:44,984 --> 01:19:47,621
Why’s he still coming at me?

897
01:19:47,687 --> 01:19:51,222
You’re stronger than this guy.
Don’t back up, don’t back off!

898
01:19:51,824 --> 01:19:56,132
This guy is a bull-rusher. He’ll keep
coming at you all night, until you stop him.

899
01:19:56,196 --> 01:19:59,231
He can’t back up. You stop him.

900
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:03,709
You gotta beat this son of a bitch
from the inside out!

901
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,873
You hear me? You gotta get in there.

902
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:09,542
You get in there and hit him
and keep hitting until you break his nose.

903
01:20:09,609 --> 01:20:11,712
You fill his face with blood.

904
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:15,953
Beat him from the inside out, Jim,
from the inside out!

905
01:20:16,516 --> 01:20:20,790
Lasky continues to fire. Braddock
looks like he’s finally starting to wilt.

906
01:20:20,853 --> 01:20:23,990
That’s it. That’s more like it.

907
01:20:24,924 --> 01:20:26,424
Back him up.

908
01:20:28,194 --> 01:20:32,297
Lasky now looking to put a Grimm ending
to Braddock’s fairy-tale comeback.

909
01:20:32,365 --> 01:20:35,741
Lasky pounding hard shots to the body.

910
01:20:38,538 --> 01:20:41,539
Braddock just took a tremendous shot,
a hard right to the head,

911
01:20:41,608 --> 01:20:43,813
which knocked his mouthpiece
to the canvas.

912
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:16,875
Braddock just took Lasky’s best shot
and it didn’t even faze him.

913
01:21:37,063 --> 01:21:40,041
Get in there and take that sucker!

914
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:43,736
He’s showing tremendous determination.

915
01:21:48,508 --> 01:21:51,145
Right in there, and get his nose!

916
01:21:57,317 --> 01:21:59,988
Braddock comes in
with a hard shot to the body.

917
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:03,758
Lasky’s wilting under the pressure
from the Bulldog of Bergen.

918
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:09,358
Braddock’s now back on the attack.
Another vicious combination by Braddock.

919
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:11,532
Lasky flowing blood from the nose.

920
01:22:11,597 --> 01:22:13,870
The 15th and final round.

921
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:16,843
Braddock now looks like
the younger fighter.

922
01:22:16,903 --> 01:22:21,370
The Garden is on its feet!
Jim Braddock will not be denied!

923
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:24,908
There’s the bell.
This one goes to the scorecards.

924
01:22:26,946 --> 01:22:31,288
And the winner, by unanimous decision,

925
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:34,954
James J. Braddock!

926
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:54,140
Thanks, buddy.

927
01:22:57,577 --> 01:23:00,078
- Max?
- What?

928
01:23:01,414 --> 01:23:03,517
Max!

929
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:07,391
Jim Braddock just beat Lasky.
They made him the number one contender.

930
01:23:07,453 --> 01:23:09,124
- Max, when are we...?
- Shut up.

931
01:23:09,188 --> 01:23:11,961
- Maxie.
- Shut up!

932
01:23:18,831 --> 01:23:22,741
I’m not gonna fight Jimmy Braddock.
He’s a chump.

933
01:23:22,802 --> 01:23:26,973
You tell Johnston to bring me
somebody who can fight back.

934
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:30,744
You’re gonna bust your contract?
It’s done, Max.

935
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:48,364
There’s Braddock.

936
01:24:29,168 --> 01:24:31,339
Hey, Mrs. Braddock.

937
01:24:34,607 --> 01:24:37,483
- Sara’s here.
- Yeah?

938
01:24:37,543 --> 01:24:40,714
- I got her to sleep.
- Hey.

939
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,917
Hey, Jim.

940
01:24:44,484 --> 01:24:47,360
Mike’s gone missing.

941
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:49,523
How long?

942
01:24:50,490 --> 01:24:52,593
Three days.

943
01:24:52,658 --> 01:24:55,932
I’ve been staying at my brother’s
since Jake cut him.

944
01:24:55,995 --> 01:24:58,336
Jake fired him? I didn’t know that.

945
01:24:58,397 --> 01:25:03,603
You know how Mike gets.
All his talk, so much trouble.

946
01:25:05,004 --> 01:25:08,005
He’s been sleeping nights
down in the Hooverville.

947
01:25:08,074 --> 01:25:11,052
My brother didn’t have room
for both him and us.

948
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:14,054
Mike said, you know,
if he had to stay down there anyway,

949
01:25:14,113 --> 01:25:17,182
he was gonna try
to get everybody organized.

950
01:25:17,717 --> 01:25:20,956
Something’s wrong, Jim. I know it.

951
01:25:21,888 --> 01:25:25,162
Now I’m hearing
there’s some trouble in Hooverville.

952
01:25:25,224 --> 01:25:28,634
He wouldn’t leave me and the baby
for this long.

953
01:25:29,295 --> 01:25:31,568
He just wouldn’t.

954
01:25:32,131 --> 01:25:35,041
I didn’t know who else to come to, Jim.

955
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:47,442
Come on, out of the way.
Beat it. Move along.

956
01:25:54,921 --> 01:25:58,626
Get the hell out of here, coppers!

957
01:25:59,692 --> 01:26:02,261
Mike! Mike Wilson!

958
01:26:03,863 --> 01:26:06,398
Mike Wilson!

959
01:26:07,934 --> 01:26:11,276
We didn’t do nothing. You let
these commies in here and start a riot.

960
01:26:11,337 --> 01:26:13,872
Then what do you think’s
gonna happen?

961
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:16,782
Get over here. On your feet!

962
01:26:16,842 --> 01:26:20,081
You pull a knife on me, you son of a bitch?

963
01:26:25,618 --> 01:26:29,653
We tried to break up these agitators,
peaceful like, but they charged us.

964
01:26:29,722 --> 01:26:32,996
- What is this?
- Horses got spooked, the wagons tipped.

965
01:26:33,059 --> 01:26:37,060
Three or four of ‘em got run over.
They’re hurt pretty bad.

966
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,471
Go away. Come on, move.
Move back.

967
01:26:44,537 --> 01:26:47,140
Keep those bastards back.

968
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:52,550
Get those guys next.
The ones who got trampled.

969
01:26:59,185 --> 01:27:02,322
- Hey, Jim.
- Mike.

970
01:27:06,759 --> 01:27:08,862
You’re gonna be OK, Mike.

971
01:27:08,928 --> 01:27:12,429
- Tell Sara... Tell her...
- I’ll tell Sara.

972
01:27:12,498 --> 01:27:14,635
...I’m gonna be late, Jimmy.

973
01:27:55,741 --> 01:27:58,980
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

974
01:27:59,045 --> 01:28:03,785
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

975
01:28:04,383 --> 01:28:06,918
Give us this day our daily bread

976
01:28:06,986 --> 01:28:12,260
and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

977
01:28:12,324 --> 01:28:17,064
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

978
01:28:17,229 --> 01:28:19,229
Mae. Look up, Mae.

979
01:28:29,075 --> 01:28:31,075
How about it, Pete, yeah?
Time-out.

980
01:28:31,143 --> 01:28:34,121
That’s it. Keep your questions
short and to the point.

981
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:37,419
We’re gonna start off with Frank Essex.
Frank Essex.

982
01:28:37,483 --> 01:28:40,518
Take it easy, Petey. Jeez.
Frank Essex, Daily News.

983
01:28:40,586 --> 01:28:44,155
A lot of reporters here today,
a lot of people interested in this fight.

984
01:28:44,223 --> 01:28:48,099
What do you got to say
to your fans today, Jimmy?

985
01:28:49,428 --> 01:28:52,804
I guess I’m grateful for the opportunity.

986
01:28:55,301 --> 01:28:59,404
I know that these days
not everybody gets a second chance.

987
01:28:59,472 --> 01:29:01,609
I have a lot to be grateful for.

988
01:29:01,674 --> 01:29:06,414
I have three beautiful, healthy,
troublemaking kids.

989
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,321
And I have the prettiest wife
a man could wish for.

990
01:29:10,382 --> 01:29:12,917
Bob Johnson, Boston Globe.

991
01:29:12,985 --> 01:29:17,259
Two days ago we ran a story about you
giving your relief money back.

992
01:29:17,823 --> 01:29:20,494
Can you tell our readers why?

993
01:29:21,927 --> 01:29:25,462
I believe we live in a great country.

994
01:29:25,531 --> 01:29:30,271
A country that’s great enough to help
a man financially when he’s in trouble.

995
01:29:31,337 --> 01:29:36,077
But lately I have had some good fortune
and I’m back in the black,

996
01:29:37,076 --> 01:29:39,486
and I just thought I should return it.

997
01:29:41,781 --> 01:29:45,816
Listen, what’s the first thing you’re
gonna do if you make world champion?

998
01:29:45,885 --> 01:29:50,159
First thing? I’m gonna have to
go and buy some turtles.

999
01:29:50,923 --> 01:29:55,265
I said to the kids when I left the house this
morning I was gonna bring back the title,

1000
01:29:55,327 --> 01:29:58,498
and they thought I said turtle.

1001
01:29:59,498 --> 01:30:01,942
So, naturally,
I don’t wanna let ‘em down.

1002
01:30:02,001 --> 01:30:06,172
But if I could bring back the title
and a turtle, they sure would be tickled.

1003
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:09,045
You got that? Title, turtle. Right?

1004
01:30:09,108 --> 01:30:12,450
- Jake Greenblatt from Chicago Trib.
- Hello, Jake.

1005
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:14,852
It’s been a while. What’s changed, Jimmy?

1006
01:30:14,914 --> 01:30:18,051
I mean, you couldn’t win a fight
for love or money, right?

1007
01:30:18,117 --> 01:30:20,220
How do you explain your comeback?

1008
01:30:20,686 --> 01:30:25,096
The truth is, Jake, for a number of years
there, we was fighting injured.

1009
01:30:25,157 --> 01:30:29,260
I broke my hand. More than once.

1010
01:30:29,328 --> 01:30:34,829
I got in a car accident one time I was
on the road, and I had to get that fixed.

1011
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,571
Ihad a run of bad luck.

1012
01:30:39,071 --> 01:30:42,379
And this time around,
I know what I’m fighting for.

1013
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:45,510
Yeah? What’s that, Jimmy?

1014
01:30:45,578 --> 01:30:48,385
- Milk.
- Milk?

1015
01:30:48,447 --> 01:30:52,187
- Sporty Lewis, New York Herald.
- Sporty.

1016
01:30:52,284 --> 01:30:54,955
Actually, my question’s for Mrs. Braddock.

1017
01:30:54,987 --> 01:30:57,829
Mrs. Braddock, my readers
would love to know,

1018
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:02,800
how do you feel about the fact
that Max Baer’s killed two men in the ring?

1019
01:31:04,063 --> 01:31:08,234
So, how do you feel about that, ma’am?
Are you scared for your husband’s life?

1020
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,642
She’s scared for Max Baer,
is who she’s scared for, Mr. Lewis.

1021
01:31:11,704 --> 01:31:14,705
How about one more question?

1022
01:31:25,517 --> 01:31:30,927
- Said downstairs you wanted to see us.
- Sure. Jim, come on in. Have a seat.

1023
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:33,161
Right here.

1024
01:31:34,793 --> 01:31:38,032
Editorial says this fight is good as murder.

1025
01:31:38,097 --> 01:31:43,098
And everybody associated with it should
be hauled into court and prosecuted after.

1026
01:31:43,168 --> 01:31:46,703
They’re getting letters from people
saying you’re their inspiration.

1027
01:31:46,772 --> 01:31:50,875
Like you saved their lives or something.
If you ask me, it’s a lot of crap.

1028
01:31:50,943 --> 01:31:54,978
But I’m not getting hung out to dry
if something happens to you.

1029
01:31:55,047 --> 01:31:57,025
You’re all heart.

1030
01:31:57,983 --> 01:32:01,154
My heart’s for my family.
My brains and my balls are for business.

1031
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:04,755
- And this is business. You got me?
- Got you.

1032
01:32:08,093 --> 01:32:11,162
You will know exactly
what you’re up against.

1033
01:32:12,131 --> 01:32:18,035
And my attorney Mr. Mills will witness I’ve
done everything in my power to warn you.

1034
01:32:20,039 --> 01:32:22,676
You know, I seen the Camera fight.

1035
01:32:22,741 --> 01:32:26,344
- Camera’s height saved him.
- He was knocked down 12 times.

1036
01:32:26,412 --> 01:32:29,288
Exactly. It would’ve been worse
if he was shorter.

1037
01:32:29,348 --> 01:32:34,349
Baer had to punch up to hit him.
Took a little something off.

1038
01:32:41,226 --> 01:32:43,329
That’s Frankie Campbell.

1039
01:32:43,395 --> 01:32:46,566
Stand-up fighter,
knows how to take a punch.

1040
01:32:47,266 --> 01:32:49,539
His style familiar, Jim?

1041
01:32:50,436 --> 01:32:53,710
- Like looking in a mirror.
- He don’t need to see this.

1042
01:32:53,772 --> 01:32:56,807
He’ll see it or I’ll call off the fight.

1043
01:33:07,553 --> 01:33:09,690
Do you see that combination?

1044
01:33:09,755 --> 01:33:13,892
Campbell didn’t go down
on the first punch. He was a tough guy.

1045
01:33:13,959 --> 01:33:17,335
Second one killed him, on the spot.

1046
01:33:23,769 --> 01:33:26,213
Just cut it off, will you?

1047
01:33:32,378 --> 01:33:38,084
The autopsy said that his brain was
knocked loose from the connecting tissue.

1048
01:33:40,652 --> 01:33:43,630
Consider your ass fully covered, OK?

1049
01:33:46,859 --> 01:33:48,859
Run it again.

1050
01:34:53,859 --> 01:34:58,803
Remember Ernie Schaaf?
Nice guy. You lost one to him in’ 31.

1051
01:34:58,864 --> 01:35:03,104
Ernie took one of those on the chin
from Baer. He was dead and didn’t know it.

1052
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:09,044
Next fight, first little nothing jab put him
to sleep forever. Detached brain, they said.

1053
01:35:10,542 --> 01:35:12,815
Joe

1054
01:35:12,878 --> 01:35:15,379
No snappy comeback?

1055
01:35:15,447 --> 01:35:19,448
It ain’t my skull
the guy’s gonna try and stove in.

1056
01:35:20,752 --> 01:35:23,093
You want to think about it?

1057
01:35:24,523 --> 01:35:26,899
You think you’re telling me something?

1058
01:35:27,893 --> 01:35:31,360
What, like boxing’s dangerous,
something like that?

1059
01:35:33,499 --> 01:35:38,909
You don’t think triple shifts or workin’ nights
on scaffolds is just as likely to kill a guy?

1060
01:35:39,638 --> 01:35:44,139
How many guys died the other night living
in cardboard shacks trying to save on rent?

1061
01:35:44,209 --> 01:35:47,517
Guys just trying to feed their family.
‘Cause men like you

1062
01:35:47,579 --> 01:35:51,319
have not yet quite figured out a way to
make money out of watching that guy die.

1063
01:35:51,416 --> 01:35:55,156
In my profession - and it’s my profession -

1064
01:35:56,588 --> 01:35:59,998
I’m a little more fortunate.

1065
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:06,336
All righty, then.

1066
01:36:06,398 --> 01:36:10,467
You guys have dinner here tonight.
Take your wives. It’s on me.

1067
01:36:10,536 --> 01:36:12,946
We’ll snap some pics on your way out.

1068
01:36:13,005 --> 01:36:15,915
You change your mind,
at least we got some press out of it.

1069
01:36:15,974 --> 01:36:18,009
Good. Come on.

1070
01:36:29,555 --> 01:36:31,999
It’s gorgeous. It’s gorgeous.

1071
01:36:32,057 --> 01:36:33,557
Jimmy.

1072
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:37,592
- Can we get silver faucets?
- What do you want, a dozen?

1073
01:36:37,663 --> 01:36:42,767
Listen. A little bird told me to check
the evening editions. Let’s see what we got.

1074
01:36:42,834 --> 01:36:45,607
Boxer Jim Braddock
has come back from the dead

1075
01:36:45,671 --> 01:36:49,581
to change the face of courage
in our nation.

1076
01:36:49,641 --> 01:36:51,244
That’s nice.

1077
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:53,845
- Sporty Lewis wrote that.
- Sporty Lewis?

1078
01:36:55,013 --> 01:36:58,855
Get this:
In a land that’s downtrodden,

1079
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:02,759
Braddock’s comeback
is giving hope to every American.

1080
01:37:04,289 --> 01:37:09,563
People ready to throw in the towel
are finding inspiration in their new hero.

1081
01:37:10,362 --> 01:37:12,897
As Damon Runyon has already written,

1082
01:37:12,965 --> 01:37:16,102
he’s truly the Cinderella Man.

1083
01:37:17,069 --> 01:37:18,740
- Cinderella Man?
- Yeah.

1084
01:37:18,804 --> 01:37:21,043
I like it.

1085
01:37:21,106 --> 01:37:25,550
- It’s kinda girly.
- Oh, brother. This is gonna be fun.

1086
01:37:25,611 --> 01:37:27,782
- Excuse me.
- Jim.

1087
01:37:28,614 --> 01:37:31,456
- I’m not quite finished yet.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

1088
01:37:31,516 --> 01:37:33,426
Thank you.

1089
01:37:33,485 --> 01:37:36,258
You know what? I got the bill here.

1090
01:37:36,321 --> 01:37:40,390
Johnston, he’s a big spender.
He’s gonna leave a big, big tip.

1091
01:37:40,459 --> 01:37:43,664
It’s a real peach.
Gotta love the guy, right, sweetie?

1092
01:37:43,729 --> 01:37:46,366
- Look at this!
- This is me.

1093
01:37:50,302 --> 01:37:52,007
Jimmy.

1094
01:38:11,137 --> 01:38:12,637
Oh, boy.

1095
01:38:13,973 --> 01:38:17,042
- You think Johnston set that up?
- Yeah, I think maybe.

1096
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:19,882
A few extra pics for the dailies.

1097
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,187
From the gentleman who just arrived.

1098
01:38:23,249 --> 01:38:26,591
Mr. Baer said to wish you bon voyage.

1099
01:38:30,823 --> 01:38:33,324
Don’t open it. We’ll take it with us.

1100
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:35,132
- Hey, Joey?
- Yeah?

1101
01:38:35,194 --> 01:38:37,604
- Get the coats.
- Whoa, whoa, Jim.

1102
01:38:37,663 --> 01:38:40,266
Jim. Jimmy.

1103
01:38:46,872 --> 01:38:51,509
- Well, if it ain’t Cinderella Man.
- Thanks for the champagne.

1104
01:38:51,611 --> 01:38:54,589
You’re doing great publicizing the fight.
I appreciate it.

1105
01:38:54,614 --> 01:38:58,149
I hope it’s gonna be
a very successful night for both of us.

1106
01:38:58,217 --> 01:39:01,991
You keep tellin’ people
you’re gonna kill me in the ring.

1107
01:39:02,054 --> 01:39:05,657
I got three kids. You’re upsettin’
my family, particularly my wife.

1108
01:39:05,725 --> 01:39:07,998
Listen, Braddock.

1109
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:11,368
I’m asking you sincerely
not to take this fight.

1110
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:15,101
Now, you seem like a decent fella.
People admire you.

1111
01:39:15,167 --> 01:39:17,668
I really don’t want to hurt you.

1112
01:39:17,703 --> 01:39:22,875
It’s no joke, pal.
People die in fairy tales all the time.

1113
01:39:22,942 --> 01:39:25,147
- Max!
- Jim! How about a shot?

1114
01:39:25,211 --> 01:39:27,018
- Smile.
- There you go.

1115
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:29,318
- Just smile.
- One more.

1116
01:39:29,382 --> 01:39:32,485
Yeah, the smart thing’d be
for you to take a fall.

1117
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:34,620
Circus act’s over, old man.

1118
01:39:37,723 --> 01:39:39,223
- Right here.
- Great.

1119
01:39:39,292 --> 01:39:42,168
I think I’ll go a few rounds
with the dancing Baer.

1120
01:39:45,064 --> 01:39:47,837
Very good. OK. OK.

1121
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:50,901
Hey, we’ll see you in the ring.
How about that, champ?

1122
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:53,141
Yeah? Come on. Let’s go, Jim.

1123
01:39:53,205 --> 01:39:55,740
Max, my wife Mae.

1124
01:39:55,808 --> 01:39:58,081
You oughta talk to him, Mae.

1125
01:39:58,144 --> 01:40:01,145
You are far too pretty to be a widow.

1126
01:40:02,014 --> 01:40:06,651
- That’s not nice, Max. Not nice.
- Maybe I can comfort you after he’s gone.

1127
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:10,288
Hey! I said shut your goddamn mouth,
you punk!

1128
01:40:15,594 --> 01:40:18,436
Sorry. Send me the cleaning bill.

1129
01:40:19,432 --> 01:40:23,933
Get that, boys? Now he’s got his wife
doin’ his fighting for him.

1130
01:40:28,174 --> 01:40:30,379
Yeah. Ain’t she something?

1131
01:40:35,414 --> 01:40:37,551
Get me a drink.

1132
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:50,127
OK. Three-punch combo, OK?

1133
01:40:50,196 --> 01:40:53,299
Pop, pop, bang. Come on.

1134
01:40:54,567 --> 01:40:57,443
Yeah. That’s good.

1135
01:40:57,503 --> 01:41:00,106
Keep your thumbs tucked in,
keep your elbows in.

1136
01:41:00,172 --> 01:41:02,241
All right, that’s enough now.

1137
01:41:02,308 --> 01:41:05,252
- There’s some sting in that.
- That’s enough, please.

1138
01:41:05,311 --> 01:41:07,812
Yeah, good. Bang.

1139
01:41:09,648 --> 01:41:13,717
- I want a turn, Dad.
- Where’s the defense? Get your hands up.

1140
01:41:13,786 --> 01:41:15,786
I want a turn.

1141
01:41:17,857 --> 01:41:20,596
Pop, pop, bang.

1142
01:41:22,395 --> 01:41:24,373
Pop, bang, bang.

1143
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:25,964
Come on, Howie.

1144
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:30,806
That’s enough! No boxing in the house!

1145
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:35,212
No boxing out of the house. All right?
No boxing, period.

1146
01:41:35,274 --> 01:41:39,616
You’re gonna stay in school,
and then go to college and have professions.

1147
01:41:39,678 --> 01:41:42,883
Because you’re not gonna have
your skulls smashed in too.

1148
01:41:42,948 --> 01:41:45,619
Do you understand me?
Is that clear?

1149
01:41:54,693 --> 01:41:56,500
Why don’t you get ready for bed?

1150
01:42:19,084 --> 01:42:22,687
I... used to pray...

1151
01:42:23,656 --> 01:42:27,464
for you to get hurt just enough

1152
01:42:27,526 --> 01:42:30,402
so you couldn’t fight anymore.

1153
01:42:30,463 --> 01:42:34,237
And when they took your license away,
even scared as I was,

1154
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:38,244
I went to the church
and I thanked God for it.

1155
01:42:38,304 --> 01:42:44,044
‘Cause I always knew a day might come
when it could kill you.

1156
01:42:44,109 --> 01:42:48,315
- I just knew it, Jimmy, and now it’s here.
- Hey. You just got the jitters.

1157
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:53,324
He’s killed two men, Jimmy.
What’s worth it? Huh? What’s worth it?

1158
01:42:53,419 --> 01:42:56,658
I have to believe I got
some kind of say over our lives.

1159
01:42:56,689 --> 01:42:58,133
OK?

1160
01:42:58,190 --> 01:43:02,191
If things are bad, that we can change ‘em.
We can make things better for our family.

1161
01:43:02,261 --> 01:43:05,796
But I need you to be safe!

1162
01:43:05,865 --> 01:43:08,843
- Nothing’s safe, and without that...
- So much!

1163
01:43:08,901 --> 01:43:12,072
- Nothing’s safe at all.
- I need you to be safe. All right.

1164
01:43:12,137 --> 01:43:16,081
I have stood by for all of it.

1165
01:43:16,141 --> 01:43:19,051
Until now.

1166
01:43:19,111 --> 01:43:22,180
Not for this, Jimmy. I just can’t.

1167
01:43:23,115 --> 01:43:28,685
So you train all you want. Make a show of it
for yourself, for the papers.

1168
01:43:28,754 --> 01:43:31,323
But you find a way out of that fight.

1169
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:34,800
Break your hand again if you have to.

1170
01:43:57,583 --> 01:43:59,822
So how's he doing?

1171
01:43:59,885 --> 01:44:02,261
He’s old, he’s arthritic,

1172
01:44:02,321 --> 01:44:05,560
and his ribs haven’t been right
since the Lasky fight.

1173
01:44:05,624 --> 01:44:07,829
What’s the bad news, sunshine?

1174
01:44:08,561 --> 01:44:11,664
- Joe. The reporters are here.
- Jesus.

1175
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:14,867
Right. Get rid of that
goddamn rib protector. Jimmy!

1176
01:44:14,934 --> 01:44:17,912
Press is here, boyo!
Get bouncing around in that ring!

1177
01:44:17,970 --> 01:44:20,880
Showtime, big smiles!
You’re the belle of the ball!

1178
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:23,816
Baer don’t need to know
about no goddamn ribs.

1179
01:45:53,365 --> 01:45:55,468
Bye, Dad.

1180
01:46:15,921 --> 01:46:18,228
Come on. Lets go. Lets go.

1181
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:21,132
Let’s go. Come on.

1182
01:46:33,472 --> 01:46:35,848
- Look! It’s Braddock!
- Jimmy!

1183
01:46:35,908 --> 01:46:38,443
There’s Braddock!

1184
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:44,287
Hey, this is your night, Bulldog.

1185
01:46:44,349 --> 01:46:47,384
- Give him a good fight, now.
- We’re with you, Jimmy!

1186
01:46:47,453 --> 01:46:49,556
You’re gonna beat him, Bulldog!

1187
01:46:54,026 --> 01:46:56,936
- Well, look who’s here.
- Hi, Aunt Alice.

1188
01:46:56,995 --> 01:46:59,632
Come on in.

1189
01:46:59,698 --> 01:47:02,369
No radio, all right?

1190
01:47:02,434 --> 01:47:05,878
- Yeah. Sure.
- All right. Be back soon.

1191
01:47:27,159 --> 01:47:31,069
- Hello, Mae.
- I came to pray for Jim.

1192
01:47:32,931 --> 01:47:35,670
So did they.

1193
01:47:35,734 --> 01:47:38,178
Yeah.

1194
01:47:46,245 --> 01:47:50,189
They all think that Jim’s...
fighting for them.

1195
01:48:53,078 --> 01:48:56,579
- Yeah?
- Who beat that John Henry Lewis?

1196
01:48:59,318 --> 01:49:02,921
- That Braddock guy.
- Correct.

1197
01:49:02,988 --> 01:49:05,261
Who whupped that Art Lasky punk?

1198
01:49:05,324 --> 01:49:08,393
- James J. Braddock.
- Correct again.

1199
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:12,029
Now, refresh me on this one.
Who was it that took that Corn Griffin

1200
01:49:12,097 --> 01:49:14,666
and turned him inside out
with no questions asked?

1201
01:49:14,733 --> 01:49:17,472
Who was that?

1202
01:49:17,536 --> 01:49:20,037
I used to think it was me,
but now i'm kinda thinking it was you.

1203
01:49:20,105 --> 01:49:23,049
No, don’t you sell yourself short.

1204
01:49:23,108 --> 01:49:28,109
At some stage, you think maybe
we’ll do some taping, maybe?

1205
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:30,521
Why not, why not?

1206
01:49:35,854 --> 01:49:38,093
Let’s see. How’s that?

1207
01:49:39,858 --> 01:49:41,858
What?

1208
01:50:00,312 --> 01:50:02,483
Excuse me, ma’am.

1209
01:50:10,522 --> 01:50:13,432
You can’t win without me behind you.

1210
01:50:16,228 --> 01:50:18,729
That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.

1211
01:50:28,273 --> 01:50:33,149
Maybe I understand some
about havin’ a fight.

1212
01:50:34,846 --> 01:50:38,313
So you just remember who you are.

1213
01:50:38,784 --> 01:50:41,353
You’re the Bulldog of Bergen

1214
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:44,557
and the pride of New Jersey.

1215
01:50:44,623 --> 01:50:47,158
You’re everybody’s hope,

1216
01:50:47,225 --> 01:50:50,135
and you’re your kids’ hero.

1217
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:57,236
And you are the champion of my heart,
James J. Braddock.

1218
01:51:07,446 --> 01:51:09,787
You know, you’d better go home.

1219
01:51:10,749 --> 01:51:13,318
You know, boxers hang around
places like this

1220
01:51:13,385 --> 01:51:16,192
and you don’t want to get tangled up
in that kind of crowd.

1221
01:51:16,254 --> 01:51:18,823
A nice girl like you.

1222
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:21,197
OK.

1223
01:51:21,259 --> 01:51:23,896
I’ll see you at home.

1224
01:51:29,267 --> 01:51:31,677
Please, Jimmy.

1225
01:51:33,071 --> 01:51:35,708
I’ll see you at home?

1226
01:51:36,675 --> 01:51:38,778
See you at home, baby.

1227
01:51:59,531 --> 01:52:02,600
Madison Square Garden Bowl...

1228
01:52:02,667 --> 01:52:05,202
the biggest pugilistic event
of the year.

1229
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:08,941
Max Baer versus the
Cinderella Man - Jimmy Braddock.

1230
01:52:10,308 --> 01:52:15,718
In a moment, the contestants for tonight’s
bout will be making their way to the ring.

1231
01:52:36,935 --> 01:52:39,436
God Almighty.

1232
01:52:46,945 --> 01:52:50,412
Jim Braddock’s rise to number one
heavyweight contender

1233
01:52:50,515 --> 01:52:52,515
has truly been miraculous.

1234
01:52:52,551 --> 01:52:57,120
Never in all my years
have I seen this arena so quiet.

1235
01:53:25,083 --> 01:53:27,584
You can do it, Jimmy!

1236
01:53:34,926 --> 01:53:37,267
James J. Braddock, the Cinderella Man,

1237
01:53:37,329 --> 01:53:39,773
who just a year ago
was standing in a bread line.

1238
01:53:39,831 --> 01:53:42,366
Braddock’s a tremendous underdog
with the betters,

1239
01:53:42,434 --> 01:53:44,935
but you wouldn’t know it
from the crowd’s reaction.

1240
01:53:50,675 --> 01:53:54,585
People buying tickets looked
as if they were spending their last dollar.

1241
01:53:54,646 --> 01:53:58,181
But they’re here now, and 35,000 strong.
Listen to them!

1242
01:54:18,069 --> 01:54:21,809
We understand Max Baer
has left his dressing room. There he is.

1243
01:54:21,873 --> 01:54:24,612
Baer has the look and swagger
of a Hollywood star.

1244
01:54:24,676 --> 01:54:29,677
Tonight there’ll be no playacting, not with
Braddock in the ring. This fight is for real.

1245
01:54:29,748 --> 01:54:32,351
The table’s been set:
let’s get to the main course.

1246
01:54:36,621 --> 01:54:39,497
Gentlemen, I gave you the rules
in the dressing room.

1247
01:54:39,558 --> 01:54:43,559
- One minute to midnight, Cinderella.
- Your clock’s about ticked down, asshole.

1248
01:54:43,628 --> 01:54:46,038
Tell laughing boy no backhanding.

1249
01:54:46,097 --> 01:54:49,837
- No holding and hitting on the breakaway.
- No low blows.

1250
01:54:49,935 --> 01:54:55,470
- Tell this bohunk no manhandling.
- Watch your language, you nasty little shit.

1251
01:54:59,511 --> 01:55:04,319
- Holy mackerel, it talks! Look at that.
- Keep your hands up at all times.

1252
01:55:04,382 --> 01:55:08,383
Touch gloves and come out fighting.
Good luck. Go to your corners.

1253
01:55:08,453 --> 01:55:12,329
I’ll kick his Mick balls up to the roof
of his mouth. That oughta taste familiar.

1254
01:55:15,594 --> 01:55:17,765
Come on, Jimmy boy!

1255
01:55:19,264 --> 01:55:22,674
Come on, boys.
Get some pictures here. Come on!

1256
01:55:31,476 --> 01:55:35,079
You can do this. This guy is made for you.

1257
01:55:35,146 --> 01:55:37,851
Have a picnic, all right?

1258
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:44,230
There’s the bell, and the fight is on.

1259
01:55:51,963 --> 01:55:56,100
The boys come out and immediately
Braddock shoots a left to Max’s jaw.

1260
01:55:57,902 --> 01:56:00,812
That’s it. Take it right to him, Jimmy.

1261
01:56:02,507 --> 01:56:04,348
Now, now.

1262
01:56:04,409 --> 01:56:07,114
He snaps Braddock’s head back
with two uppercuts.

1263
01:56:07,178 --> 01:56:12,554
It’s always the question of which Max will
show up in the first round- killer or clown?

1264
01:56:21,493 --> 01:56:25,062
It looks like he’s enjoying himself,
mugging for the crowd.

1265
01:56:26,698 --> 01:56:29,142
A big flurry by Braddock.
A vicious right to the head.

1266
01:56:37,909 --> 01:56:42,080
Take it easy, pal.
I’ll let it go a couple of rounds.

1267
01:56:42,147 --> 01:56:46,216
Madcap Maxie is heavily favored to put
the long snore on Jim in the first round.

1268
01:56:46,284 --> 01:56:49,660
That right hand is dynamite,
especially with his man on the ropes.

1269
01:56:49,754 --> 01:56:51,959
He’s gonna carry him for a couple of rounds.

1270
01:56:56,795 --> 01:56:59,898
Break it up. Break it up, I said!

1271
01:57:03,601 --> 01:57:06,340
Jim survived the round
and looked pretty good doing it.

1272
01:57:06,404 --> 01:57:08,677
Braddock will not be bullied, not tonight.

1273
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:12,309
When he does this horseshit, knock it off.
He’s trying to thumb you.

1274
01:57:12,377 --> 01:57:15,753
And then slip inside of there
and shorten up the punches, right?

1275
01:57:15,814 --> 01:57:19,656
Shorten ‘em up. That’s your turf.
Inside is yours.

1276
01:57:19,718 --> 01:57:22,696
- Put him down, Braddock!
- Come on, Braddock!

1277
01:57:22,754 --> 01:57:25,857
Well, no one expected Braddock
to go past the first round.

1278
01:57:25,924 --> 01:57:29,061
- Stay inside of him.
- The experts were wrong again.

1279
01:57:29,127 --> 01:57:33,503
- Shorten ‘em up!
- There’s the bell. The second round.

1280
01:57:33,565 --> 01:57:35,838
Now add some salt on it!

1281
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:41,208
Braddock lands a hard right to the head.
Max swats him away with utter contempt.

1282
01:57:41,272 --> 01:57:45,443
He appears to be toying with Braddock.
There’s no other word for it.

1283
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:48,579
Struts around the ring
without a care in the world.

1284
01:57:51,282 --> 01:57:54,624
Sharp and vicious. Clip it, short. Good.

1285
01:57:59,357 --> 01:58:01,767
Knock that out.

1286
01:58:01,826 --> 01:58:07,168
And Max responds with swinging rights
and lefts. All power punches from Maxie.

1287
01:58:14,305 --> 01:58:17,806
Braddock comes back
with a vicious right to the head.

1288
01:58:22,814 --> 01:58:24,985
Cover up. Cover up.

1289
01:58:26,317 --> 01:58:28,818
Is that the right spot, Jimmy?

1290
01:58:28,853 --> 01:58:31,160
Break it up. Make it clean.

1291
01:58:40,865 --> 01:58:42,536
How are those ribs?

1292
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:46,442
OK. All right.
Take it easy. Just breathe.

1293
01:58:46,504 --> 01:58:49,675
- Deep breaths. Relax.
- Good rhythm.

1294
01:58:49,774 --> 01:58:52,911
You’re looking great out there, Jimmy.
You look great.

1295
01:58:52,944 --> 01:58:55,047
Hey, Jim? Jim?

1296
01:58:55,113 --> 01:58:58,091
If he goes for your body,
drop the elbows on him.

1297
01:58:58,149 --> 01:59:00,525
Teach him a lesson.
Break his goddamn hand.

1298
01:59:00,585 --> 01:59:04,120
That round was tough to score.
Braddock landed several right hands.

1299
01:59:04,189 --> 01:59:06,599
And those thunderous body punches
by the champ

1300
01:59:06,658 --> 01:59:08,795
should pay dividends in the later rounds.

1301
01:59:10,929 --> 01:59:13,873
In the fifth, Baer’s smile is gone.

1302
01:59:15,667 --> 01:59:20,202
Jimmy comes in there with a hard right,
then neatly slides up to Baer’s left.

1303
01:59:20,738 --> 01:59:23,875
Avoiding the counterpunch,
Jimmy sticks a jab.

1304
01:59:26,978 --> 01:59:29,854
Now the crowd is jeering
and even laughing at the champ,

1305
01:59:29,914 --> 01:59:32,119
and Maxie’s none too pleased.

1306
01:59:32,183 --> 01:59:35,320
All right, break it. Break. Break, break.

1307
01:59:35,753 --> 01:59:39,061
Baer backhands Braddock
across the face. That’ll cost Maxie.

1308
01:59:39,123 --> 01:59:42,033
- You lousy shaygitz!
- That’s a warning, Max.

1309
01:59:43,895 --> 01:59:46,066
I’m sorry.

1310
01:59:47,499 --> 01:59:50,272
- Hows that wife of yours?
- Break!

1311
01:59:54,539 --> 01:59:57,847
- Does she talk about me?
- Break off the wrastling. Break it up.

1312
01:59:57,909 --> 02:00:00,910
Quit fooling around, Max.

1313
02:00:02,413 --> 02:00:05,584
- Low blow!
- Keep ‘em up.

1314
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:07,821
Wake up, you wet son of a bitch!

1315
02:00:13,224 --> 02:00:16,725
Max salutes the crowd.
He’s one of a kind, folks.

1316
02:00:16,794 --> 02:00:19,135
Say my name in her sleep?

1317
02:00:20,164 --> 02:00:22,937
Baer took a chinful of Braddock’s head
in that clinch.

1318
02:00:23,001 --> 02:00:25,036
That’s it! Work his body!

1319
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:30,309
She miss me?

1320
02:00:30,375 --> 02:00:32,648
Baer grips Braddock’s head in a headlock.

1321
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:35,688
Hey, Max!
You gonna punch him or pork him?

1322
02:00:35,747 --> 02:00:37,156
That’s your job, asshole.

1323
02:00:37,215 --> 02:00:40,216
Jimmy fights his way free,
gets a shot to the head.

1324
02:00:40,285 --> 02:00:42,786
You kidding me? You watching this?

1325
02:00:42,854 --> 02:00:44,764
You’re gonna get hurt.

1326
02:00:45,423 --> 02:00:49,390
Braddock keeps punching.
They hammer each other toe-to-toe.

1327
02:00:53,598 --> 02:00:55,439
Keep your hands up and mouth shut.

1328
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:58,239
You watching the fight,
or the cute guy in the front row?

1329
02:00:58,303 --> 02:01:02,213
Take a seat, Maxie. He’s nothin’, nobody.
The guy has got nothin’.

1330
02:01:02,273 --> 02:01:05,274
Jesus. Sit down.

1331
02:01:06,244 --> 02:01:07,983
Give me the sponge.

1332
02:01:08,046 --> 02:01:10,217
- What are you doin’?
- Don’t worry about it.

1333
02:01:10,281 --> 02:01:13,918
- Quit screwing around.
- Relax.

1334
02:01:13,985 --> 02:01:16,292
Give me the goddamn water.

1335
02:01:21,693 --> 02:01:23,796
Ten seconds!

1336
02:01:34,105 --> 02:01:37,015
Hit this guy. Hit him! Hit him!

1337
02:01:37,075 --> 02:01:39,178
Cut him down to size!

1338
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:43,179
Shit.

1339
02:01:43,615 --> 02:01:45,820
In the seventh, the boys come out again.

1340
02:01:45,883 --> 02:01:48,622
And Max is all business now.

1341
02:01:51,255 --> 02:01:52,892
- Get him!
- Come on!

1342
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:56,465
Slide it, Jimmy!

1343
02:01:57,595 --> 02:02:01,664
Braddock starting to look his age here
as Baer pushes him around the ring.

1344
02:02:02,233 --> 02:02:05,870
Baer swings hard to the body.
Braddock gets in a right to the head.

1345
02:02:17,548 --> 02:02:19,889
Jesus Christ.

1346
02:02:19,951 --> 02:02:23,691
Baer with a tremendous shot.
That was the hardest blow in the fight.

1347
02:02:30,094 --> 02:02:33,538
Baer pounds him again,
with another right to the head.

1348
02:02:41,706 --> 02:02:43,547
Push him, push him!

1349
02:02:54,886 --> 02:02:57,091
Braddock gets in a vicious uppercut.

1350
02:02:58,790 --> 02:03:00,927
- Baer keeps on punching.
- Johnny!

1351
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:04,902
That’s enough.
Break it up, break it up.

1352
02:03:04,962 --> 02:03:07,167
You’re gonna go home in butcher paper.

1353
02:03:07,231 --> 02:03:09,936
Butcher paper!

1354
02:03:12,904 --> 02:03:15,405
All right, let me see that nose.

1355
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,850
Get it out, get it out. Let me see it, Jim.

1356
02:03:17,909 --> 02:03:20,182
That’s nothing.
That’s a piece of cake.

1357
02:03:20,244 --> 02:03:23,620
Keep your head up, breathe
through your mouth. Breathe, breathe.

1358
02:03:23,681 --> 02:03:28,057
All your ugly friends are down from Jersey.
They dressed up nice, came to see you.

1359
02:03:28,119 --> 02:03:31,654
You’re putting ‘em to sleep.
You’re not turning him anymore, Jimmy.

1360
02:03:31,723 --> 02:03:35,224
Come on, pick it up. Spit that out, boyo.

1361
02:03:35,293 --> 02:03:38,862
Good boy. Good boy, good boy.

1362
02:03:38,930 --> 02:03:41,601
Good boy. Come on.

1363
02:03:43,401 --> 02:03:46,106
The boys go after each other immediately.

1364
02:03:46,170 --> 02:03:49,273
- Braddock gets in a left to the body and...
- Mae.

1365
02:03:51,776 --> 02:03:54,720
It’s the cops.

1366
02:03:54,779 --> 02:03:58,587
Braddock stumbles away.
Baer tries that right again.

1367
02:03:58,649 --> 02:04:01,525
They come together.
Braddock swings a left and a right.

1368
02:04:01,586 --> 02:04:03,257
Please, Ma.

1369
02:04:04,822 --> 02:04:07,732
Braddock sticks out a left.
Baer still after him.

1370
02:04:07,792 --> 02:04:11,668
Another left, and a hard right!
That’s knocked Baer for a moment.

1371
02:04:11,729 --> 02:04:13,468
Baer tries that right again.

1372
02:04:17,335 --> 02:04:21,938
A hard right to Braddock’s head.
Braddock is hurt. His legs are gone.

1373
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:31,956
Braddock sticks out a left. Another left.

1374
02:04:36,621 --> 02:04:39,565
Neither man will back down.
It’s a slugfest, folks.

1375
02:04:39,624 --> 02:04:41,795
And there’s the bell.

1376
02:04:41,859 --> 02:04:45,167
James J. Braddock has exhibited
a lot of heart here

1377
02:04:45,229 --> 02:04:47,934
over 11 grueling rounds
with the champion.

1378
02:04:47,999 --> 02:04:51,204
Nobody expected him to last
more than a few innings with Baer,

1379
02:04:51,302 --> 02:04:54,746
yet here he is,
and he’s held his own.

1380
02:04:54,772 --> 02:04:57,750
But now we head
into the championship rounds, folks.

1381
02:05:00,745 --> 02:05:03,246
Jim? Look at me.

1382
02:05:05,316 --> 02:05:08,521
I swear to God, boyo. Win, lose or draw...

1383
02:05:09,053 --> 02:05:12,656
Thanks, Joey. For all of it.

1384
02:05:13,324 --> 02:05:18,325
Son of a bitch.
All right? Stop talking. Get in there!

1385
02:05:18,396 --> 02:05:21,340
And bury him!

1386
02:05:21,933 --> 02:05:24,672
Come on, Jimmy!

1387
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:34,882
Here in the 12th, James J. Braddock is
showing this crowd what heart is all about.

1388
02:05:41,886 --> 02:05:46,023
Jimmy seems to be timing that left
and has slapped it away several times.

1389
02:05:51,896 --> 02:05:54,635
You stay with him! Son of a bitch!

1390
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:59,210
Braddock with a shoeshine.
Left-right, left-right!

1391
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:03,680
- Am I seeing what I’m seeing?
- Finish him, Jimmy, finish him!

1392
02:06:03,741 --> 02:06:06,378
Braddock! Braddock!

1393
02:06:14,585 --> 02:06:18,552
Maxie’s glamour-boy smile
is now a bloody grimace.

1394
02:06:18,623 --> 02:06:21,726
This crowd is definitely hoping
for a Braddock victory.

1395
02:06:21,792 --> 02:06:24,793
But Mr. Baer might have something
to say about that.

1396
02:06:28,266 --> 02:06:29,607
Holy crap!

1397
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:37,811
Low blow!

1398
02:06:39,277 --> 02:06:40,948
Jesus!

1399
02:06:41,012 --> 02:06:45,547
- Hey! Why not just kick him in the balls?
- Joe, back in your corner.

1400
02:06:45,616 --> 02:06:48,787
What are you afraid of, you son of a bitch?

1401
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:54,934
- Come on, ref.
- Jesus Christ!

1402
02:06:55,459 --> 02:06:59,960
McAvoy is on the verge
of losing control of this fight.

1403
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,137
Knock him on the ground, Bulldog!

1404
02:07:07,838 --> 02:07:10,339
- Last round.
- That’s right! Next champ!

1405
02:07:12,476 --> 02:07:15,818
You won this one. It’s a cinch. It is yours.

1406
02:07:16,914 --> 02:07:20,119
But I want you to play it cagey now.
All right?

1407
02:07:20,184 --> 02:07:24,094
I know you don’t like laying back,
but I want to stay away from his right.

1408
02:07:24,155 --> 02:07:26,360
Do you understand me? Stay away.

1409
02:07:26,424 --> 02:07:28,561
Right hand.

1410
02:07:28,626 --> 02:07:31,661
You’re behind. Are you listening to me?

1411
02:07:31,729 --> 02:07:34,866
You wanna lose the championship
to this goddamn nobody?

1412
02:07:36,334 --> 02:07:38,209
This is your night.

1413
02:07:39,971 --> 02:07:41,005
Stay away.

1414
02:07:41,072 --> 02:07:44,073
Put him down! Put him down!

1415
02:07:44,141 --> 02:07:46,244
Use the right hand, right hand.

1416
02:07:48,512 --> 02:07:51,513
This is it. This is your shot.

1417
02:07:51,615 --> 02:07:53,752
- Ten seconds!
- Finish him.

1418
02:07:58,689 --> 02:08:02,394
It’s the last round, Jimmy.
There ain’t no more.

1419
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:06,927
You play this bastard smart
and they can’t take it from you.

1420
02:08:15,573 --> 02:08:21,477
One more round. McAvoy is at center ring,
waiting for the fighters to join him.

1421
02:08:42,633 --> 02:08:45,270
Touch gloves.

1422
02:08:46,604 --> 02:08:50,514
The boys touch gloves at center ring.
And now they’re right back at it!

1423
02:08:50,608 --> 02:08:53,018
No, Jimmy!

1424
02:08:54,812 --> 02:08:57,517
Leave him alone!

1425
02:08:57,581 --> 02:09:01,684
Stay away from him! That ain’t laying back!

1426
02:09:01,752 --> 02:09:05,026
Braddock’s corner is yelling at him
to stay away from Baer,

1427
02:09:05,089 --> 02:09:06,623
who’s looking for the knockout.

1428
02:09:06,690 --> 02:09:08,725
Stay off him, Jim. Come on.

1429
02:09:11,529 --> 02:09:13,098
Right hand, Max!

1430
02:09:21,005 --> 02:09:23,449
What is he, stupid?

1431
02:09:25,676 --> 02:09:27,915
Step away, step away!

1432
02:09:27,978 --> 02:09:30,319
trying to survive this brutal onslaught.

1433
02:09:30,381 --> 02:09:33,018
Stay off him!

1434
02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:37,688
Looking good, Maxie!

1435
02:09:41,792 --> 02:09:44,168
That’s the uppercut.
Stay the hell away from it.

1436
02:09:44,228 --> 02:09:47,331
Baer cutting loose with thunderous shots.

1437
02:09:47,398 --> 02:09:49,774
A left to the body.
Baer, again with the right.

1438
02:09:50,201 --> 02:09:52,804
Braddock covering up, trying to hang on.

1439
02:09:53,737 --> 02:09:58,011
Baer looking for the knockout. He doesn’t
want this one to go to the cards, folks.

1440
02:09:58,075 --> 02:10:00,314
They pound each other with lefts and rights.

1441
02:10:00,377 --> 02:10:06,219
Braddock blocking with his gloves and
elbows. Snaps a big right to Maxie’s jaw.

1442
02:10:14,291 --> 02:10:17,394
Baer smashes him with a big right.

1443
02:10:24,902 --> 02:10:28,312
Braddock is back on the ropes.

1444
02:11:13,784 --> 02:11:16,785
Braddock lands a crushing right!

1445
02:11:16,854 --> 02:11:21,923
Maxie desperately wants
to keep the crown from slipping away.

1446
02:11:25,629 --> 02:11:27,698
Jesus Christ!

1447
02:11:31,435 --> 02:11:33,970
Stay with him.

1448
02:11:37,908 --> 02:11:40,943
Both fighters are tired.

1449
02:11:49,353 --> 02:11:51,592
Baer is trying wildly for the knockout.

1450
02:11:52,189 --> 02:11:56,758
Jimmy is still standing. And he’s not
only standing, he’s moving forward.

1451
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:12,413
This is the finish. Both boys are tired.

1452
02:12:12,476 --> 02:12:16,250
This is not boxing, folks.
This is a walloping ballet.

1453
02:12:20,517 --> 02:12:23,756
- Ten seconds!
- Son of a bitch.

1454
02:12:37,635 --> 02:12:41,045
There’s the bell!
It’s over! This fight is over!

1455
02:12:43,073 --> 02:12:45,244
Son of a bitch!

1456
02:12:52,316 --> 02:12:55,487
What a fight! Unbelievable!

1457
02:12:59,156 --> 02:13:03,623
Braddock came into this fight
the biggest underdog in pugilistic history.

1458
02:13:03,694 --> 02:13:06,035
For 15 rounds
he gave it everything he had

1459
02:13:06,096 --> 02:13:08,369
against the younger, stronger champion.

1460
02:13:19,443 --> 02:13:21,546
We are waiting for the decision.

1461
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:24,580
It’s over.

1462
02:13:30,254 --> 02:13:32,891
McAvoy. McAvoy.

1463
02:13:33,324 --> 02:13:36,063
- What?
- Help me out. How’d you score the fight?

1464
02:13:36,126 --> 02:13:39,331
- Nine-five, one even.
- Which way?

1465
02:13:39,897 --> 02:13:43,171
- You have to read it in the papers, Sporty.
- No, come on!

1466
02:13:45,569 --> 02:13:48,376
What the hell is this crap?

1467
02:13:50,941 --> 02:13:55,408
They take this long to make a decision,
they’re gonna decide to screw someone.

1468
02:13:56,647 --> 02:14:00,091
- Make a decision!
- They’re gonna rob this poor bastard.

1469
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:02,526
Unbelievable bullshit.

1470
02:14:08,926 --> 02:14:11,927
Come on, make a decision here!

1471
02:14:15,299 --> 02:14:19,505
The crowd, on its feet for almost
the entire fight, is still standing,

1472
02:14:19,570 --> 02:14:24,037
yelling for who they clearly believe
to be the winner of this fight.

1473
02:14:25,008 --> 02:14:28,748
We’ll have to wait and see
how the judges scored it.

1474
02:14:45,829 --> 02:14:48,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

1475
02:14:48,565 --> 02:14:51,270
we have your decision.

1476
02:14:52,336 --> 02:14:54,575
It’s unanimous.

1477
02:14:54,638 --> 02:14:59,139
Winner and the new world champion,

1478
02:15:00,477 --> 02:15:03,751
James J. Braddock!

1479
02:15:19,563 --> 02:15:21,336
You son of a bitch.

1480
02:15:21,398 --> 02:15:24,137
Jim Braddock has defeated Max Baer

1481
02:15:24,201 --> 02:15:27,179
for the heavyweight championship
of the world!

1482
02:15:29,506 --> 02:15:32,007
He won!

1483
02:15:48,008 --> 02:15:50,508
You earned it.
Hell of a fight.
