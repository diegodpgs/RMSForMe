FURY: I didn't lie.

195

Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

ROGERS: Those hostages could have died, Nick.

199

That's what makes it an army.

Not a bunch of guys

Look, I didn't want you doing

a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

He'd say, "Hi."

They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

229

Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

He'd show them.

235

Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

236

once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

the World Security Council

we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

and calling it protection.

00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,533
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

265
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,220
But we did it
so that people could be free.

Come on in.

581
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,013
PIERCE: That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

582
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:56,620
when I was at State Department
in Bogota.

583
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:59,293
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

584
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:03,737
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

585
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:07,422
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

586
00:42:07,573 --> 00:42:08,904
and he comes to me with a plan.

587
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,108
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

588
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:13,898
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

589
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:18,460
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

590
00:42:18,693 --> 00:42:20,821

and what do they find?

They find it empty.

592
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:25,536
Nick had ignored my direct order,

593
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:29,055
and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

594
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,855

a dozen political officers,

00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,054

602

he was the one who bugged it?

603

00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:10,181
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

607
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:12,828
ROGERS: Are you saying he's a suspect?

608
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:14,503
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

609
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,499
PIERCE: No, no.
It's more complicated than that.

610
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:20,259
<i>Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.</i>

611
00:43:20,453 --> 00:43:23,935
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

612
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:28,544
and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

613
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,016
The last one going to
a holding company

614
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,380
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

615
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:34,933
ROGERS: Am I supposed to know who that is?

616
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,095
PIERCE: Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

617
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:40,224
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

618
00:43:40,973 --> 00:43:44,261
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

619
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:49,221
ROGERS: Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

620
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:51,417
PIERCE: The prevailing theory

621
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,303
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

622
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:57,860
and sale of classified intelligence.

623
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:02,503
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

624
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:08,418
ROGERS: If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

625
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:11,735
PIERCE: Why do you think we're talking?

626
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:17,944
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

627
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:21,899
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

628
00:44:23,373 --> 00:44:27,697
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

629
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,900
to build a really better world

630
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:34,776
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

631
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:38,458
And that makes enemies.

632
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:43,623
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

633
00:44:43,813 --> 00:44:46,578
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

634
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:50,658
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

635
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:54,579
makes me really, really angry.

Many of which you seemed to have had
a personal hand in telling.

1581
02:03:13,533 --> 02:03:14,773
Agent, you should know

1582
02:03:14,933 --> 02:03:16,617
that there are some on this committee

1583
02:03:16,813 --> 02:03:18,941
who feel, given your service record,

1584
02:03:19,133 --> 02:03:20,862
both for this country and against it,

1585
02:03:21,613 --> 02:03:23,377
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1586
02:03:23,573 --> 02:03:25,541
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1587
02:03:27,453 --> 02:03:29,057
ROMANOFF: You're not going to put me in a prison.

1588
02:03:30,053 --> 02:03:33,978
ROMANOFF: You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

1589
02:03:35,413 --> 02:03:36,824
Do enlighten us.

1590
02:03:37,093 --> 02:03:38,424
ROMANOFF: Because you need us.

1591
02:03:39,533 --> 02:03:41,820
<i>Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,</i>

1592
02:03:42,013 --> 02:03:44,175
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

1593
02:03:44,733 --> 02:03:47,498
<i>But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.</i>

1594
02:03:49,133 --> 02:03:51,101
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

1595
02:03:52,133 --> 02:03:53,817
You'll know where to find me.

1596
02:04:29,293 --> 02:04:32,137
FURY: So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1597
02:04:32,653 --> 02:04:34,178
You get used to it.

1598
02:04:36,893 --> 02:04:39,055
FURY: We've been data mining HYDRA'S files.

1599
02:04:39,293 --> 02:04:41,421
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1600
02:04:42,973 --> 02:04:44,338
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1601
02:04:45,293 --> 02:04:46,533
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1602
02:04:47,693 --> 02:04:49,343
There's something I got to do first.

1603
02:04:50,253 --> 02:04:52,779
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

1604
02:04:53,853 --> 02:04:55,537
SAM: I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1605
02:04:56,653 --> 02:04:58,417
FURY: All right, then.

1606
02:05:03,053 --> 02:05:07,263
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

1607
02:05:09,053 --> 02:05:10,657
ROMANOFF: You should be honoured.
That's about as close as he gets

1608
02:05:10,853 --> 02:05:12,503
to saying thank you.

1609
02:05:13,653 --> 02:05:14,734
ROGERS: Not going with him?

1610
02:05:15,213 --> 02:05:16,499
No.

1611
02:05:16,693 --> 02:05:18,695
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1612
02:05:19,533 --> 02:05:21,693
ROMANOFF: I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

1613
02:05:21,893 --> 02:05:22,894
ROGERS: That might take a while.

1614
02:05:23,413 --> 02:05:25,017
ROMANOFF: I'm counting on it.

1615
02:05:27,253 --> 02:05:28,379
That thing you asked for,

1616
02:05:28,733 --> 02:05:31,054
I called in a few favours from Kiev.

1617
02:05:34,013 --> 02:05:36,744
ROMANOFF: Will you do me a favour? Call that nurse.

1618
02:05:37,173 --> 02:05:38,379
ROGERS: She's not a nurse.

1619
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:40,416
ROMANOFF: And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1620
02:05:41,333 --> 02:05:43,415
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1621
02:05:44,173 --> 02:05:45,174
ROMANOFF: She's nice.

1622
02:05:57,653 --> 02:05:59,417
Be careful, Steve.

1623
02:06:00,253 --> 02:06:01,982
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1624
02:06:13,533 --> 02:06:15,297
You're going after him.

1625
02:06:15,693 --> 02:06:16,979
ROGERS: You don't have to come with me.

1626
02:06:17,133 --> 02:06:18,214
SAM: I know.

1627
02:06:20,173 --> 02:06:21,334
When do we start?

1628
02:08:20,733 --> 02:08:24,374
MAN: It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1629
02:08:25,093 --> 02:08:26,424
Everything he knows about.

1630
02:08:27,013 --> 02:08:28,933
<i>Herr Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,</i>

1631
02:08:29,053 --> 02:08:30,862
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1632
02:08:31,053 --> 02:08:32,782
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1633
02:08:33,773 --> 02:08:36,617
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1634
02:08:40,453 --> 02:08:41,943
What we have

1635
02:08:43,973 --> 02:08:46,624
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1636
02:08:49,253 --> 02:08:52,939
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

1637
02:08:55,733 --> 02:08:59,579
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1638
02:09:00,733 --> 02:09:04,180
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

1639
02:09:04,373 --> 02:09:06,216
and keep them off our scent.

1640
02:09:06,413 --> 02:09:08,654
What about the volunteers?

1641
02:09:08,893 --> 02:09:10,418
The dead will be buried so deep

1642
02:09:10,653 --> 02:09:12,781
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1643
02:09:14,853 --> 02:09:16,093
And the survivors?

1644
02:09:18,213 --> 02:09:19,738
The twins.

1645
02:09:23,293 --> 02:09:26,422
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

1646
02:09:28,613 --> 02:09:30,536
It's not a world of spies any more.

1647
02:09:30,733 --> 02:09:32,701
Not even a world of heroes.

1648
02:09:33,693 --> 02:09:36,424
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

1649
02:09:38,293 --> 02:09:40,580
There's nothing more horrifying

1650
02:09:41,413 --> 02:09:42,539
than a miracle.
