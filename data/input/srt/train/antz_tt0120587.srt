1
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,855
All my life, I've lived
and worked in the big city

2
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,171
which, now that I think of it,
is kind of a problem,

3
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,656
since I always feel
uncomfortable around crowds.

4
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,573
I mean it.
I have a fear of enclosed spaces.

5
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,055
Everything makes me feel trapped.

6
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,099
I tell myself there's gotta be
something better out there.

7
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,296
But maybe I... I think too much.

8
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,338
I think everything
goes back to the fact...

9
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,974
that I had a very anxious childhood.

10
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,972
My mother never had time for me.

11
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,729
When you're the middle child
in a family of five million,

12
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,176
you don't get any attention.
How is it possible?

13
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,933
And I've had
these abandonment issues.

14
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,251
My father was basically a drone,
like I've said.

15
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,013
And the guy flew away
when I was a larva.

16
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,174
And my job, don't get me started,
because it really annoys me.

17
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,855
I-I was not cut out to be a worker,
I'll tell you right now.

18
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,773
I-I-I feel physically inadequate.

19
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,897
My whole life,
I've never been able to lift...

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,494
more than 10 times
my own body weight.

21
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,818
And, when you get down to it,
handling dirt is, you know... urgh,

22
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,539
is not my idea
of a rewarding career.

23
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,498
It's this whole gung ho,
superorganism thing...

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,219
that... that, you know, I can't get.

25
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,052
I try, but I don't get it.

26
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,894
I mean... I'm supposed
to do everything for the colony.

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,574
A-and what about my needs?
What about me?

28
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,494
I've gotta believe
there's someplace better than this.

29
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,698
Otherwise, I would just curl up
in a larval position and weep.

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,136
(Sighs) The whole system
makes me feel...

31
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,211
(Exhales) insignificant.

32
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,576
(Doctor) Excellent.
You've made a breakthrough.

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,891
- I have?
- Yes, Z. You are insignificant.

34
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,652
I am?

35
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,771
(Chattering)

36
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,976
(Ant) Ground floor.

37
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,776
(Babies crying softly)

38
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,374
- (Cries)
- Uh, worker.

39
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,131
Soldier.

40
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,051
Ooh. (Giggles)

41
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,256
- Uh-oh.
- Worker.

42
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,771
(Cries)

43
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,816
(Ant) Let's try it again.

44
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,650
Firm grip. Swing hard.
Back straight. Concentrate.

45
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,577
Follow through.

46
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,257
(Grunts)

47
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,369
OK. Got to keep a positive attitude.

48
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,213
Even though
I'm utterly insignificant.

49
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,296
I'm-I'm insignificant, um,
but with attitude.

50
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,610
- (Coughs)
- (Woman) Oh, sorry, Z,

51
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,214
- I didn't see ya.
- Great, Azteca.

52
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,854
I'm so meaningless, I'm invisible.

53
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,936
- (Grunts)
- (Laughter)

54
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,891
Now, you're getting it.

55
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,336
After all, it's not about you.

56
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,213
It's about us... the team.

57
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,814
It's about... this.

58
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,254
Uh, a giant hole in the ground?

59
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,969
- OK, people. Are we feeling good?
- (All) Yeah!

60
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,971
- Yeah.
- Great.

61
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,009
Now, R-1734 through Z-7829,
you guys are on wrecking ball.

62
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,852
- You got it.
- Swell.

63
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,096
- You got it.
- (Ant) All right.

64
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,250
(Enthusiastic shouts)

65
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,808
Now, remember, Azteca,
"Be the ball."

66
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,779
That's the main thing.
You know, be one with the ball.

67
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,691
Would you cut it out already?

68
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,090
Jeez. I love my work.
And you, well...

69
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,489
You think too much.

70
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,653
Come on, Z. Help us build
a bigger, better colony.

71
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,731
And try to be happy about it.

72
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,776
Sure, you know. I mean, why...

73
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,091
How could I be unhappy being
construction equipment?

74
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,774
- OK, workers, remember.
- Here it comes.

75
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,658
- Be the ball.
- Oh!

76
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,812
(Foreman)
Let the energy flow through you.

77
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,052
G-grin and bear it. This is...
this is for the colony. Oh.

78
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,812
- (All yelling)
- Ow!

79
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,370
T-this is just a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

80
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,452
- Hang on. Here we go.
- Faster. Harder.

81
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,974
Did you know
heights make me nauseous?

82
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,015
No.

83
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,409
(Ant) This is a ball!

84
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,934
- (All yelling)
- Hey!

85
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,209
- (Azteca) Oh, Z.
- Yes, yes. I dropped the ball.

86
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,733
(Ant) Workers. They're weak.

87
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,051
They lack discipline.
They lack commitment.

88
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,849
General, I know there's
been a glitch or two,

89
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,216
but everybody is working full tilt,
as it is...

90
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,654
You can't help it, it's your nature.

91
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,890
But in spite of your limitations,

92
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,813
you will finish
this tunnel on schedule.

93
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,697
Come hell or high water.

94
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,693
Anyone who falls behind
will explain why to Colonel Cutter.

95
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,376
And let me assure you, the colonel
is not as understanding as I am.

96
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,257
Dismissed.

97
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,617
Four more days, Cutter.
Four more days.

98
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,375
Then we can bid farewell
to their kind of incompetence.

99
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,813
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,891
A fresh start.

101
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,858
- Imagine it!
- A strong colony, sir.

102
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,817
A colony we can be proud of.

103
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,175
Yes, but we're not there yet.

104
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,856
We just got word that a termite army
has mobilised against us.

105
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,489
- Against us?
- We'll have to send troops...

106
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,377
to attack their colony.

107
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,769
Attack a termite colony, sir?

108
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,816
- That's suicide.
- Exactly.

109
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,688
- Do you have the list I asked for?
- Yes, General.

110
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,739
These are the units
loyal to the queen.

111
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,372
Hm. Then they're
the ones we'll be sending.

112
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,577
It's a shame.
There's some fine officers here.

113
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,733
Don't we need the queen's
approval to declare war?

114
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,776
Our very next stop, Cutter.

115
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,579
General,
we've been at peace for years.

116
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,572
- Why would they attack?
- They want our land.

117
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,734
They're desperate for new territory.
Perhaps they think we've grown soft.

118
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,371
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador,
negotiate a new treaty?

119
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,896
- We don't need to send soldiers.
- Believe me,

120
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,376
every ant in this colony
is so precious to me.

121
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,258
- (Grunts)
- That's why we must strike now.

122
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,410
We have the element of surprise.

123
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,298
If the termite troops
enter our colony...

124
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,259
Yes, General,
I know what they can do to us.

125
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,333
- Very well.
- You've made a wise decision.

126
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,856
In fact, you've ensured
the future of this colony.

127
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,651
Hello, General.

128
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,938
Princess Bala. What a nice surprise.

129
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,488
You look lovelier
each time I see you.

130
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,573
Thanks. I hope you're not
just here on business.

131
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,493
Oh, of course... (Chuckles)
of course not.

132
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,180
Because, um, it might be nice...

133
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,856
if we had a conversation once
before we get married.

134
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,934
You're absolutely right. Schedule me
some private time with Princess Bala.

135
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,376
Uh, sir, there is time now
for a personal moment.

136
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,815
We're a few seconds
ahead of schedule.

137
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,777
Excellent. Princess.

138
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,330
Well, a few seconds isn't much,

139
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,732
but I guess if it's quality time...

140
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,336
So, how was your day?
Anything interesting happen?

141
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,698
- We declared war.
- Declared war?

142
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,657
Boy, talk about a rough day.

143
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,699
Sir, I hate to interrupt,
but time stands still for no ant.

144
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,611
Princess.

145
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,176
Mom, could you remind me,
why am I marrying this guy?

146
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,138
Bala, do we have to argue
about this again?

147
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,008
We don't have anything in common.
The guy's a stiff.

148
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,694
Yes, darling.
I know the General is...

149
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,170
a little gruff
and somewhat overbearing at times,

150
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,058
but I know that he cares about you.

151
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,291
He's just not particularly good
at showing it.

152
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,168
But he was very persistent
when he asked to marry you.

153
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,932
But why me?

154
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,695
Because you're the one
who has to continue my work.

155
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,649
- What if I don't like my place?
- Everyone has their place, Bala...

156
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,732
you, the soldiers, the workers.

157
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,493
It's not that bad
being princess, is it?

158
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,811
Would you rather be
carting around dirt all day?

159
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,697
Mother, don't be so dramatic.

160
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,816
(Music plays)

161
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,698
At least they have some fun
every now and then.

162
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,410
- Two aphid beers.
- Why'd I have to be born a worker?

163
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,856
You soldiers get glory,
plus you get to go outside.

164
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,977
You meet interesting insects,
you kill them.

165
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,211
Yeah. But you get to spend
all day with those...

166
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,860
beautiful worker girls.

167
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,331
Weaver, they're career girls.
They're obsessed with digging.

168
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,299
I don't think I'm ever
gonna meet the right girl for me.

169
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,577
A girl for you?
I was talking about a girl for me.

170
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,969
Don't you want your aphid beer?

171
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,531
Call me crazy, but I can't drink
from the anus of another creature.

172
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,258
Suit yourself.

173
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,492
Ahh. Me, I'm cuttin' loose.
We got royal inspection comin' up.

174
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,290
Standing around like an idiot while
a bunch of blue-bloods smirk at you.

175
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,331
How do you put up with it?

176
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,139
Z, I've known you
for a long time, right?

177
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,415
You were born two seconds after me.

178
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,776
And ever since then
I've listened to you complain.

179
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,694
What are you bitching about?
We ants are running the show.

180
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,691
We're the lords of the Earth.

181
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,499
Hey, don't talk to me
about earth, OK?

182
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,095
Cos I just spent all day
hauling it around.

183
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,411
(Sighs) There's just
gotta be a better place.

184
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,968
There is. I've been there.

185
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,176
Sorry? Were you talking to me?

186
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,172
There is a better place...

187
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,932
Insectopia.

188
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,658
Oh, really?

189
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,935
Lunatic at three o'clock.

190
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,013
You can't understand till you
go there and see it yourself.

191
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,090
You can be your own ant there.

192
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,535
The streets are paved with food.

193
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,656
Nobody tellin' you what to do.

194
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,139
No wars.

195
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,778
No colony.

196
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,218
- I shoulda never left.
- Oh. Fascinating.

197
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,213
We were on a long-range recon.
I got cut off from my unit.

198
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,929
Nothing like post-traumatic stress
disorder to complete your day.

199
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,614
- Then I saw it! Insectopia!
- Hey!

200
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,611
You head towards the monolith.

201
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,249
Ten clicks past the canyons
to the land of red and white.

202
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,695
You've had enough for one night.

203
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,248
Come on. Before you get in trouble.

204
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,776
Head for the monolith. Listen to me!
The monolith!

205
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,697
That guy's got a screw loose.

206
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,248
- Across the lake!
- Insectopia. Hmm.

207
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,535
It'd be great if it were that easy.

208
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,169
- Yeah. Dream on, Z.
- Cross the lake!

209
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,058
Look for the land of red and white!

210
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,131
Wow!

211
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,690
This is so... gritty.

212
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,817
Ten minutes, right?
This place is off limits.

213
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,494
Just blame me.
Say it was all my idea.

214
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,608
- It is all your idea.
- Besides, no one will recognise us.

215
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,055
Come on, girls. What do you say?

216
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,337
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

217
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,015
(Dull voice on PA)
'OK, everybody, 6:15. Time to dance.'

218
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,058
- Time to cut a rug, Z.
- Oh, no. That's OK.

219
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,371
I'm gonna leave the rug
just the way it is, Weaver.

220
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,930
(# Slow jazz)

221
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,052
Step back, ladies.

222
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,450
I'm gonna ask one of these
workers to dance with me.

223
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,019
Oh.

224
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,376
What a bunch of losers.

225
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,169
Mindless zombies capitulating
to an oppressive system.

226
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,012
Hi. Wanna dance?

227
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,091
Absolutely.

228
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,290
Follow me.

229
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,895
So, how come I haven't seen you
around here before?

230
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,734
Oh, I don't get out much.
I, uh, I work over at the palace.

231
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,130
The palace?
I bet those royals really live it up.

232
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,656
Course they're all...
you know... from inbreeding.

233
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,889
What?

234
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,898
Yowch!

235
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,690
Y-y... yowch! Yowch.

236
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,731
- Yooowch.
- What on earth are you doing?

237
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,177
Well, actually, to tell you
the truth, I'm sort of making it up.

238
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,693
Really?

239
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,456
Why does everybody have to dance
the same? That's completely boring.

240
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,451
It's no fun.

241
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,929
(# Samba)

242
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,009
Hey. Watch your step, worker.

243
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,978
You watch yours
or you'll be in big trouble!

244
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,291
Th-th-that's OK.
I'll... let him off this time.

245
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,099
Are you crazy?
He's built like a pebble.

246
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,890
- Aren't you gonna defend yourself?
- Hey, buddy. Get back in place.

247
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,450
- Me? Uh... uh...
- What if he doesn't want to?

248
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,620
Yeah. What if I don't like my place?

249
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,056
- We got us a troublemaker.
- Buckle up, Spanky.

250
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,338
This one goes out
to all the lazy workers.

251
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,648
(Grunts)

252
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,300
Watch that aggressive behaviour,
buddy.

253
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,450
He's just a worker. (Muffled)

254
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,577
- (Ants shouting)
- (Chuckles)

255
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,971
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
The guards are coming.

256
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,858
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait.

257
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,976
(Shouting and fighting)

258
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,255
Princess? You're a princess?

259
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,496
Uh... I gotta go.

260
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,731
- When can I see you again?
- Let me think.

261
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,492
Never.

262
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,094
- Bye.
- No, wait!

263
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,655
Oof!

264
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,851
# What a day it has been

265
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,773
# What a rare mood I'm in

266
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,739
# Why, it's almost like
being in love

267
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,497
# There's a smile on my face
for the whole insect race

268
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,016
# Why, it's almost like
being in love #

269
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,011
(Whistle blows)

270
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,697
Yowch.

271
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,895
(General chatter)

272
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,211
- Can I get you another one, pal?
- No... thanks.

273
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,576
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Yeah. I don't blame you.

274
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,209
It's always slow in here
before those royal reviews.

275
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,452
I guess soldiers need their shuteye
before they meet the queen.

276
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,098
That's it!

277
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,296
You know, I was once...

278
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,052
See ya.

279
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,215
(Snoring)

280
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,854
Psst. Weaver.

281
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,329
I figured it out. Weaver. Weaver!

282
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,257
What? What?

283
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,133
I got a great idea.
Switch places with me.

284
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,859
Let me go to the inspection
instead of you.

285
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,899
- What time is it?
- The royal family will be there.

286
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,814
- This is the only way I can see her.
- See who?

287
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,733
- Princess Bala.
- Are you nuts?

288
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,539
You want me
to switch places with you?

289
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,410
Do you know how much trouble you can
get into for impersonatin' a soldier?

290
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,968
It's trouble
just listenin' to someone

291
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,654
talkin' about
impersonatin' a soldier.

292
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,412
You have to help me.

293
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,413
If I can't see her again,
my life is not worth living.

294
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,657
P-p-please, Weaver. Please.

295
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,698
Switch jobs with me just, you know,
for a day.

296
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,453
Th-think of everything
I've done for you.

297
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,134
Hm. I can't think of anything.

298
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,133
OK. So, think of all the things
that I'm gonna do for you.

299
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,256
Would I meet some worker girls?

300
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,491
Are you kidding?
They always go for the new guy.

301
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,411
It's like a sport for them.

302
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,699
And they will definitely go for
an adorable little insect like you.

303
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,375
Weaver, I... I have to see her again.

304
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,658
Z, what kind of chance
do you have with a princess?

305
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,653
I mean, she probably
won't even remember you.

306
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,773
(Sighs) I-I know it sounds nuts...

307
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,896
but I have to try.

308
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,331
- Oh, boy.
- (Marching music)

309
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,610
Princess, fancy meeting you here.

310
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,538
What do you say we... lose this crowd?

311
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,056
Oh, me?
You know, I... I wear many hats.

312
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,779
You'd have to call me
a Renaissance ant.

313
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,498
(Man) Eyes right!

314
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,619
- Beautiful! Just beautiful!
- Mm.

315
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,777
- The precision. The order.
- Oh.

316
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,136
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
Hey. It's me.

317
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,057
Remember Z from the bar?

318
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,450
Princess Bala!
Princess Bala! Princess...

319
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,134
Bala, you must encourage the troops.

320
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,017
Wave.

321
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,979
Oh. She sees me.
Excuse me, guys. I-I... Sorry.

322
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,211
- I just got a better offer. Excu...
- Company halt!

323
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,737
Princess! (Princess Bala!)

324
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,129
Quiet there! Get back in rank.

325
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,452
- You new, kid?
- Y-yes, but I'm gettin' out soon.

326
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,690
I got a trial membership.

327
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,772
Trial membership. (Chuckles)
Good one!

328
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,454
- Name's Barbatus.
- Z.

329
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,417
- Right face!
- Psst.

330
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,379
(Whip cracks)

331
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,939
Sacrifice.

332
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,296
To some, it is just a word.

333
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,450
To others, it is a code.

334
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,134
- I'm bad at word games.
- (Chuckles)

335
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,929
A soldier knows that the life
of one ant doesn't matter.

336
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,851
What matters is the colony.

337
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,296
He'll live for the colony,
fight for the colony,

338
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,938
die for the colony.

339
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,376
- This guy's crazy.
- I hear ya.

340
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,090
At 0800 hours, we received word
that the termite enemy has mobilised.

341
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,570
We have no choice
but to launch a pre-emptive strike.

342
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,128
You are the queen's finest.

343
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,893
I know you will all do your duty.

344
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,653
I am proud to send you into battle.

345
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,208
Into... I'm... I'm sorry. Into battle?

346
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,532
- Dismissed.
- Left face! Forward march!

347
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,373
I think there's been
a terrible mistake.

348
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,293
The truth is
I just... came for the speech.

349
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,814
Don't worry, kid.
I'll watch out for ya.

350
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,133
- Sound off.
- One!

351
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,131
- Two!
- Three!

352
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,336
- Huh?
- Five!

353
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,773
- Six!
- Seven!

354
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,213
- Eight!
- Nine!

355
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,653
- Ten!
- Eleven!

356
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,093
- Twelve!
- Thirteen!

357
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,529
# We ants go marching one by one
hurrah, hurrah

358
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,211
(All) # We slaughter termites
just for fun, hurrah, hurrah... #

359
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,734
So, these termites, th-they're...

360
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,856
We're talkin' pushovers, right

361
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,613
Not really,
they're five times our size.

362
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,578
And they shoot acid
from their foreheads.

363
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,537
Hey! Keep it movin', shorty!

364
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,296
(All) # We ants go marching
two by two, hurrah, hurrah

365
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,816
# We'll all be dead before
we're through, hurrah... #

366
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,256
Say, exactly... what exactly
does our platoon do?

367
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,492
I mean, will we be serving beverages
or processing paperwork?

368
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,016
Our platoon has the best assignment -
first into battle.

369
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,378
# We ants go marching three by three,
hurrah, hurrah

370
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,052
(All) Hurrah! Hurrah!

371
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,736
# We're off to face our destiny
hurrah, hurrah... #

372
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,778
Let's not...
We're being too hasty here.

373
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,976
These guys sound like bruisers.

374
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,654
How were you figuring
on beating them?

375
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,655
Superior numbers, kid. Overwhelm
their defences and kill their queen.

376
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,413
Fellas, you're being
a little extreme.

377
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,016
Let's influence their political
process with campaign contributions.

378
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,018
I like you, kid.
You got a sense of humour.

379
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,493
Forward!

380
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,333
Come on!
Let's kick some termite butt!

381
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,018
Over the top!

382
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,097
- (All shouting)
- Yeeow!

383
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,299
Yee-ha!

384
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,337
(Shouting stops)

385
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,457
- Where is everyone?
- Something's not right.

386
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,052
Don't be scared, kid.

387
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,251
- (Gasps)
- (Growls)

388
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,615
They're here! Ahh!

389
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,018
Attack!

390
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,618
(Shouting, roaring and screaming)

391
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,177
(Groans)

392
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,458
Come on!

393
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,732
- (Roars)
- Ahh!

394
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,568
Barbatus, you saved my life.

395
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,935
Don't get all sappy about it.

396
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,013
- Hey, guys! Behind you!
- (Roars)

397
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,612
Hey... hey, guys?

398
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,975
Can somebody help me here?
Anybody...?

399
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,734
Yeah!

400
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,776
(Grunting)

401
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,169
OK, mama! Unh!

402
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,216
Yeah. Oof!

403
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,251
Oh, yeah. Big guy comin' through.
(Grunts)

404
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,491
I love it.

405
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,937
Hey, hey, hey!
Take it easy, muscles.

406
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,858
You're makin'
the rest of us look bad.

407
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,771
What happened to Z?

408
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,739
He's... takin' a personal day,
so I'm filling in.

409
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,017
You fill in any more,
and you'll explode.

410
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,132
Eh, you got a problem?

411
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,736
No, uh... uh... Nobody told me
digging was so much fun.

412
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,698
You know, you pick the dirt up.
You move it.

413
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,978
You pick it up again.
You move it again. Lots of reps.

414
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,210
You exercise the arms
and the thorax.

415
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,973
Yes, I... I see what you mean.

416
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,011
- Yeah. Fascinating.
- Sorry, sir!

417
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,449
I was just chattin'
with my friend, sir.

418
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,818
You know, I just had a chat
with General Mandible.

419
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,939
Anybody who doesn't meet his quota
is going to be downsized.

420
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,330
Come on. Cut him a break. He's new.

421
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,454
Hey. What do you say we help
your attitude a little bit...

422
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:54,011
by taking away
your rations for the day.

423
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,931
Thanks for your time.

424
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,893
I don't know what came over me.
Talking back like that?

425
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,571
I must be losin' it.

426
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,537
Sorry I got you in trouble.

427
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,373
But, you can...
share my rations... Whoa!

428
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,337
If you want.

429
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,890
- Are you askin' me out to dinner?
- (Chuckles)

430
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,936
Oh, no. I...

431
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,298
Well, if you don't have
anything else planned...

432
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,452
(Laughs) I'll check my calendar.

433
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,292
You know,

434
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,417
I'm kinda glad Z's takin' a breather.

435
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,417
Kid!

436
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,616
Kid, over here.

437
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,698
Barbatus.

438
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,250
Be honest, kid. Am I hurt bad?

439
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,095
N-no. N-not at all. You're...
Actually, you're lookin' terrific.

440
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,331
You got, you know,
swell colour in your cheeks.

441
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,333
No. I can see it in your eyes.

442
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,251
I'm a goner.

443
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,491
Help me up, Z.

444
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,252
(Sniffs)

445
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,729
I c-can't feel my legs.

446
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,450
You gotta hang in there, buddy.
I know you're gonna make it.

447
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,735
Just take... take deep breaths.

448
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,937
Because I'm gonna try
and find your body.

449
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,854
It's bound to be...
out there... s-somewhere.

450
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,052
(Coughs, sighs)

451
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,614
B-Barbatus, hang on.

452
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,218
- B-Barbatus.
- Don't make my mistake, kid.

453
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,497
Don't follow orders your whole life.

454
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,493
Think for yourself. Ohh...

455
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,657
Barbatus.

456
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,297
(Cutter) We're on schedule. Work
is completed on "A" section, sir.

457
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,496
We're clearing "D" section now.

458
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,777
I want double shifts
around the clock.

459
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,579
- Is that clear?
- Crystal, sir.

460
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,935
Good. What about section...

461
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,057
- Excuse me, sir.
- This better be important.

462
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,210
It's the termite battle, sir.

463
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,976
The enemy was destroyed, but it was
a disaster for our troops, as well.

464
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,450
Well, that's terrible. Terrible.

465
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,816
There is good news, sir.
One soldier made it back.

466
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,572
- No kidding.
- What?

467
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,653
Word is spreading. The Queen
wants to meet the war hero.

468
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,059
Damn!

469
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,335
Good. Damn good.

470
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,058
Uh, I'll handle this.

471
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,459
(Footsteps approaching)

472
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,174
- Congratulations, soldier.
- (Ahem)

473
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,371
You're a little short for a war hero,
aren't you?

474
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,773
A war hero? Sir, I-I don't
actually think that I'm a hero.

475
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,896
Good. I don't like heroes.

476
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,130
But, sir. You don't understand...

477
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,211
(Crowd cheering)

478
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,808
I... I didn't do anything.

479
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,859
I mean, it was all horrible.
It was just... just a massacre.

480
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,931
A-a massacre upon a massacre.

481
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,409
That's good, soldier. Now, wave.

482
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,853
(Cheering)

483
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,899
There was nothing
you could do, Weaver.

484
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,540
You didn't know
they were going to war.

485
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,497
I just feel horrible.

486
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,573
Poor Z.
I should have never let him go.

487
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,778
Wait a minute.
That's no soldier. That's Z!

488
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,819
Z? The little guy made it!
(Chuckles)

489
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,618
(Crowd cheering)

490
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,052
Let's go, soldier.

491
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,289
(Cheers)

492
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,093
(Cheers)

493
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,653
As I was saying, son,
you are an ant after my own heart.

494
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,455
An ant that looks Death
in the face and laughs.

495
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,132
Well, the truth is,

496
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,178
I-I just make belittling comments...

497
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,332
and snicker behind Death's back.
(Chuckles)

498
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,457
(Queen) General Mandible.

499
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,897
Keep your comments to yourself.
Let me do the talking.

500
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,373
(Yawns)

501
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,248
May I present
Her Majesty the Queen.

502
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,853
Charmed. Charmed.

503
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,851
And the Royal Princess Bala.

504
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,895
(Purrs)

505
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,255
Welcome home, soldier.

506
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,697
We cannot begin to express our
gratitude for your heroic efforts.

507
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,011
The private asked me to convey
his humble appreciation.

508
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,853
Please, please,
it was nothing, really.

509
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,889
Just run-of-the-mill valour...
and extraordinary courage, you know.

510
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,131
In battle,
there's very little time to think.

511
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,417
One must attack! Attack! Attack!

512
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,094
- (Chuckles) Well, indeed.
- (Muffled)

513
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,696
As you can see, Your Highness, the
battlefield is fresh in his mind,

514
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,295
so this is the perfect time
to debrief the private.

515
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,292
Oh, please, General.
Not on our first date.

516
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,735
(Chuckles) "Not on our first date."

517
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,539
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

518
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,373
Well, maybe. Then again, maybe not.

519
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,930
And then... then again...
Yowch.

520
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,534
That's it! The guy from the bar.

521
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,293
- Don't... Shh.
- Bar? What bar?

522
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,577
I danced with this guy at the bar
the other night.

523
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,491
He was just a worker, then.

524
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,209
- What were you doing at a bar?
- That's what I want to know.

525
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,657
No. This isn't about me. I mean,
look what this worker's done.

526
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,937
You're thinkin' of someone else.
I am a soldier.

527
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,171
Exactly. You WERE a worker

528
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,899
but now, you're a war hero.

529
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,575
- He's a worker?
- A worker danced with my fiancée?

530
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,571
F-fiancée?

531
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,855
W-w-wait a minute.

532
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,500
This is not how it looks.
I can explain.

533
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,889
She was the one making all the moves.

534
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,811
Arrest him.

535
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,175
H-hey, wait, can't we discuss this?

536
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,649
What are you doing? Let go of her!

537
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,890
- He's taking her hostage!
- Huh?

538
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,336
No. No, I'm not.
I mean, yes, I am.

539
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,093
One more step
and the princess gets it.

540
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,853
Oh, let go of me!

541
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,135
Ow! Don't make me hurt her.

542
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,097
Get off!

543
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,811
(Both screaming)

544
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,056
(Groans) Ugh. Oh.
What are you doing, you creep?

545
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,052
Are you out of your puny little mind?

546
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,779
(Ant) There they are! Let's go! Move!

547
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,851
Oh, good.

548
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,977
Here they come,
to rescue me... and kill you.

549
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,379
Kill?

550
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,258
- Hey, you guys!
- Stop! What are you doing?

551
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,012
Get off, you little twerp!

552
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,773
Don't throw away
everything we've got!

553
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,857
What're you waiting for? Hello! Guys!

554
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,728
- Huh?
- What is it?

555
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,330
It's beautiful.

556
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,775
Ridgeway, get out of there!

557
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,052
- Oof!
- Oh!

558
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,968
(Both sigh)

559
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,575
- Oh, don't worry. I'm OK.
- You?!

560
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,573
You're OK?
Hey, who cares about you?

561
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,776
- I almost died.
- Calm down.

562
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,648
Don't let a little
near-death experience ruin your mood.

563
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,574
Hey, this is not a mood.
You're not listening to me.

564
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,412
Where am I?

565
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:10,092
Look, what's-your-name, just climb up
that tree and find out where I am.

566
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,172
Look, th-the trick is not to panic.

567
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,774
You know,
h-h-he w-who panics is lost.

568
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,216
What am I saying? We are lost.

569
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,332
- Whoa!
- (Gasps)

570
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,773
(Chuckles)

571
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,134
Ow!

572
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,573
I've been kidnapped
by the village idiot.

573
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,139
Who's the bigger idiot -

574
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,530
the idiot, or the idiot
who gets kidnapped by the idiot?

575
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,895
Did you talk those termites to death?

576
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,859
I can't believe you tried
to pass yourself off as a soldier.

577
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,771
Why are you stalking me?

578
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,011
Don't you realise that I'm...
out of your league?

579
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,331
YOU were cruising the worker bar
for action,

580
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,456
And you happened to find it...

581
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,169
the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker.

582
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,769
Please. I was slumming it.
Don't you get it?

583
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,615
I chose you because you were the most
pathetic little bug in the joint.

584
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,659
I was gonna let you become part
of my most erotic fantasies,

585
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,935
but now, you can forget that.

586
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,457
You know, I guess what you prefer
is Old Blood and Guts.

587
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,613
His idea of a romantic night out
is two seats at an execution.

588
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,260
You really chose the right husband.

589
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,171
For your information,

590
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,731
the General and I
are deeply, deeply in...

591
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,578
engaged.

592
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,572
You come right back
down here this instant!

593
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,369
We are marching straight back
to the colony so that I...

594
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,293
(Bala continues in background)

595
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,616
The monolith!

596
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,414
Wonderful. That's an appealing offer.

597
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,732
But, considering the options, you go.
I'm going to Insectopia.

598
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:00,736
Oh, come on. Insectopia?
You're crazier than I thought.

599
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,018
Yeah? Well, I happen to have it
on a very reliable source.

600
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,375
(Ahem) Or... or should I say,

601
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,451
a drunk, raving source?

602
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,692
But the point is, I'm convinced
the place definitely exists.

603
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,819
Stop! I order you to stop, worker!

604
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,336
Hey, I got a name, OK? It's Z.

605
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,298
And out here,
you can't order me around.

606
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,178
All right. Fine. No problem.

607
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,137
Oh...!

608
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,977
(Rumbling)

609
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,858
Wha-what? (Screams)

610
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,370
- (Growls)
- (Gasps)

611
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,497
Worker! Worker! Where are you?

612
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,653
Z? Z? Wait for me.

613
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,016
No more excuses, General.
I want my daughter back.

614
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,615
I'm beginning to doubt
your ability to handle this.

615
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,170
Your Highness, we will
spare no effort to bring her back.

616
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,812
Princess Bala is... essential
to all our plans for the future.

617
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,130
So he kills himself 100 termites,

618
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:14,135
gets a few medals, then bada-bing,
bada-bip, bags himself the Princess.

619
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,132
- He looks him in the eye...
- And says, "Bite me."

620
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,972
To General Mandible?

621
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,574
Buddy. Hey, hey, buddy.

622
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,015
You heard about the war hero named Z?

623
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,375
Runs off with the Princess, right?

624
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,817
When they sent the guards after him,
he just looks at 'em and boom!

625
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,973
- They burst into flames.
- Z? (Chuckles) You talkin' about Z?

626
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,132
I know Z. He's a friend of mine.
I think you...

627
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,895
- You know Z?
- Yeah. He's a worker.

628
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,936
A worker? That's impossible.

629
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,773
A worker can't do anything,
except work.

630
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,737
Yeah. We got no choice.

631
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,493
We do have a choice.
Uh, I mean, look at Z.

632
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,253
He wanted something,
and he went for it.

633
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,538
He's not alone. I was a soldier
and I switched places with him.

634
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,178
You're tellin' me...

635
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,058
- I don't have to be here?
- We've got a choice?

636
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,649
They don't want you to know,
but we don't have to work.

637
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,459
Workers control
the means of production.

638
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,451
If Z don't dig, I don't dig.

639
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,658
People, what is this,
an encounter group? Get back to work.

640
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,855
Why?

641
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,331
...on the tunnel! This guy, Z,
he's leadin' a revolution!

642
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,297
I'll... get back to you.

643
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,894
(All chattering)

644
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,372
Think about it, Z... two ants.

645
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,931
Who ever heard of two ants?
Two million ants, maybe. But two?

646
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,659
Look, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty...

647
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,300
And this whole desert thing?

648
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,770
- It just doesn't work for me.
- Yada, yada, yada...

649
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,209
It's about time you took me back.

650
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,808
Take yourself back. Phew.

651
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,296
Excuse me!
You kidnapped me, remember?

652
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,055
That means you have
certain responsibilities.

653
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,859
You can't just abandon me here.

654
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,489
- It's better than the colony.
- You're not serious?!

655
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,017
Maybe you were living it up,
but personally, this beats digging.

656
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,490
If you'd ever done
a day's labour you'd know.

657
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,254
Labour?
What do you know about labour?

658
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,059
How would you feel
if you had to give birth

659
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,893
every ten seconds
for the rest of your life?

660
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,131
- Gee.
- Water!

661
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,018
Ahh. All you think about is yourself.

662
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,455
Nobody else ever thought about me.

663
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,418
So I don't need anybody else.

664
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,218
Unh!

665
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,860
(Muffled) Help! Help me, Bala!

666
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,898
Help! B-B-B-B-Bala!

667
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,857
I'll get you out. Hold on.

668
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,015
Help, Ba...

669
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,609
(Both gasping)

670
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,176
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

671
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,253
Now, maybe we can put
this fantasy behind us...

672
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,410
and head back to the colon...

673
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,776
Oh, Z! What are you doing?

674
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,489
- We've gotta cross the lake.
- Am I missing something?

675
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,811
Didn't we just get OUT of the water?

676
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,299
Bala, look,
what have you got to lose?

677
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,579
I mean, think about it. Do you really
want to be Mrs Raving Lunatic?

678
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,489
There's a better place.

679
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,930
Z, please.

680
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,454
Just... gimme one chance.

681
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,735
If we don't find Insectopia soon,

682
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,096
I promise
I'll take you back to the colony.

683
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,933
(Bala) I hope you know
what you're doing.

684
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,772
(Z) Yeah, me too.

685
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,577
(Indistinct shouting)

686
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,856
(Chanting) We want Z! We want Z!

687
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,297
People, come on. I know some ants
who won't make their quota.

688
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,814
Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor.

689
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,613
(Chanting continues)
We want Z! We want Z!

690
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,057
Sorry, sir. I came as soon as I
heard. I was debriefing the trackers.

691
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,337
- And? What's the report?
- Well, this Z, sir...

692
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,376
He's one slippery character.

693
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,532
They lost Bala's trail
at the edge of the lake.

694
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,611
The lake?

695
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,373
(All) # All we are saying

696
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,770
# Is give Z a chance... #

697
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,249
What's that soldier doing there?

698
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,498
It appears he's holding hands, sir.
With a worker.

699
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,856
I don't like the way
things are going, Cutter.

700
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,374
I'm counting on you for results.

701
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,974
- Can I depend on you or not?
- Yes, sir.

702
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,255
All right. Let's wrap this up.

703
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,572
(Chanting)
We want Z! We want Z! We want Z!

704
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,777
I've heard a lot about this Z.

705
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,768
I even had the pleasure
of meeting him once.

706
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,771
But where is he now?!

707
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,294
Can anyone point him out?

708
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,969
I mean, if this Z
cares so much about us,

709
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,937
then why isn't he here?

710
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,938
I'll tell you why.

711
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,012
Because Z doesn't
give a damn about us.

712
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,091
(Ants murmuring)

713
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,775
That's why he kidnapped our princess
and ran away.

714
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,051
Z is no hero.

715
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,131
We are the heroes.

716
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:14,293
We are the ones ensuring
the future of our great colony.

717
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,089
And when we've completed
this magnificent structure,

718
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,740
we will reap the benefits -

719
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,698
more food and less work for everyone.

720
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,338
(Murmurs of approval)

721
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,139
And as further reward
for your efforts,

722
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,654
every one of you
will get the day off...

723
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,412
(Excited murmurings)

724
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,018
so you can be the guests of honour at
the MegaTunnel dedication ceremonies!

725
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,534
(All cheering)

726
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,696
Mandible! Mandible!

727
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,217
(Chanting) Mandible!
Mandible! Mandible! Mandible!

728
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,810
Now, bring me that soldier.

729
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,538
(Chanting) Mandible! Mandible!

730
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,417
(Yawns)

731
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,693
(Gasps) Oh, my God! Z! Come here!

732
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,533
It's Insectopia!

733
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,617
You were right. It really is here.

734
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,456
- Huh?
- All right. All right!

735
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,576
- You're a genius.
- Let's eat.

736
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,412
Mmph!

737
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,491
Huh. (Nervous chuckle)

738
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,338
(Muttering)

739
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,019
Well? What's the problem?

740
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,376
- There's some kind of force field.
- (Buzzing)

741
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:43,296
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me!
How do you get in?

742
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:49,334
Yes, well, I'm afraid
this is a private function.

743
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,732
- Who are your friends, dear?
- Crawling insects, poopsie.

744
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,812
Oh. The poor dears.

745
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,091
(Slowly) Uh, good morning.

746
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,978
- Huh?
- Darling, really.

747
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,695
Greeting every insect
that emerges out of the grass?

748
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,615
Pardon me!
I guess you don't recognise me!

749
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,371
I've been travelling
and I'm all... schlumpy.

750
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,371
I'm Princess Bala.

751
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:24,136
Oh! It's even worse.
They're Eurotrash.

752
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,895
Darling, they're poor.
They're dirty. They're smelly.

753
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,414
We have to help them.

754
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,573
If you'll just wait right here,
we'll fetch you a little something.

755
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,891
Oh, please, Muffy.
Not another crusade.

756
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:43,054
Chippie, we have a social obligation
to the less fortunate.

757
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,258
I know you laugh at my hobbies,
but this is important to me!

758
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,218
Mm. You have such a big heart.

759
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,372
That's why you're
my little cuddly-widdles.

760
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:58,295
Oh, my big, strong pheromone factory.

761
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,217
- Mmm!
- Oh!

762
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,333
Oh, brother.
Suddenly I've lost my appetite.

763
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,779
- You know...
- Muffy...

764
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,936
I guess I had imagined Insectopia...

765
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,689
I don't know... a little differently.

766
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,777
- Oh, Muffy!
- (Gasps)

767
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,296
- No! Oh, no! (Sobbing)
- Oh, no.

768
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,848
- Rumbling
- Look out!

769
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:34,099
Z, help me! Z!

770
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,212
Don't let me... Don't let me go, Z.

771
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,459
Get me out of here!

772
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,298
Bala!

773
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,818
Whoa, this is not good.

774
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,177
Whoa!

775
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,051
Whoa-oa-oa!

776
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,697
(Bala screaming)

777
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,612
Whoa!

778
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,499
Hi.

779
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,093
(Both screaming)

780
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,689
(Thud)

781
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,930
- Z?
- Yes?

782
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:06,253
It looks like this is it, just
when... I was starting to like you.

783
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,211
(Both scream)

784
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,496
Who the hell is that?

785
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,813
Uhh!

786
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,614
That's enough.

787
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,737
I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

788
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:40,211
Soldier, the princess is vital
to the future of this colony.

789
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,975
She must be returned
to take her proper place as queen.

790
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,255
We already have a queen.

791
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,929
As for your friend Z,
why should I hurt him?

792
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,931
(Chuckles) He's not important.

793
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,171
Now, soldier,

794
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:58,252
we all know that one individual ant
doesn't matter.

795
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,332
Not you...

796
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,456
- not Cutter...
- (Door opens)

797
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,815
- (Azteca grunts)
- Not even her.

798
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,090
Azteca! (Groaning)

799
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,774
Don't tell that tight-ass! Aagh!

800
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,930
- (Grunting)
- Where is Z?

801
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,092
- I don't know where he is!
- Hmm.

802
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,852
That's too bad.

803
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,977
(Azteca groaning)

804
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,579
Wait!

805
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,139
Insectopia.

806
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,849
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's where he'd be going.

807
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:37,094
Soldier, you think this is a game?
Insectopia does not exist.

808
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,818
As a matter of fact...

809
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,379
it does.

810
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,372
- Sir?
- I'll brief you on the co-ordinates.

811
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,338
You're gonna bring
the princess back.

812
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,615
And as for Z... Kill him.

813
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,578
But you said he didn't matter.

814
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,699
It's for the good of the colony.
You made the right decision.

815
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,136
Gentlemen, now you can see...

816
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,014
how dangerous individualism can be.

817
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,933
It makes us... vulnerable.

818
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,171
Let's go.

819
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,137
(Door slams)

820
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:16,054
Take him back to the MegaTunnel.
Put him on the front line.

821
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,098
Dismissed.

822
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:31,490
(Sighs) Jeez, what was I thinking?
I almost got you killed.

823
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:35,255
Z, you know, you really
shouldn't be so hard on...

824
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:39,219
(Straining) That's it.
I'm taking you back to the colony.

825
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,212
- Uhh! Ow! Oh.
- Uhh!

826
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,610
Insectopia.
You know, I must've been crazy.

827
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,292
- Z?
- But you know what?

828
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,336
- I admit it when I'm wrong.
- Z.

829
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:53,208
And this time, I gotta tell ya,
I was absolutely, 100%...

830
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,688
correct.

831
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:02,173
Have... have you ever seen
anything more beautiful in your life?

832
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:06,776
- It's... Insect...
- Shh! Don't jinx it. Come on!

833
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,851
# I can see clearly now
the rain is gone

834
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,091
(Burps)

835
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:27,651
# I can see all obstacles in my way

836
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:34,689
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind

837
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,977
- (Ladybug) Pardon us.
- # It's gonna be a bright

838
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,689
# (Bright, bright)
Bright sunshiny day

839
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:45,329
- (Insects squealing)
- # It's gonna be a bright

840
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,095
# (Bright, bright)
Bright sunshiny day

841
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:58,338
# Look all around
nothing but blue skies

842
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,258
# Look straight ahead nothing but

843
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,408
# Blue skies

844
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,617
# Whoa

845
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:22,093
# I can see clearly now
the rain is gone

846
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,057
(Buzzing)

847
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,735
# I can see all obstacles in my way #

848
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,051
All right, everybody.
I want all teams in place,

849
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,337
fully prepared
to seal the doors here and here.

850
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,890
'Make certain the digging crew
stays on schedule...

851
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,859
'for breakthrough
midway in the dedication ceremony.

852
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,659
'Now all we need is the princess.'

853
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,411
(Sniffs) Mm.

854
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:15,539
- This stuff tastes like crap.
- Really? Let me try some.

855
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:21,378
Hey, it is crap. Not bad.

856
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,499
- Somebody needs to feed that fire.
- Dude, I did it last time.

857
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:28,219
I'm not gonna get it.
It's not my job.

858
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,737
What about the new guy?
He hasn't contributed yet.

859
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,699
And... (Sighs) You know,
he just died in my arms like that.

860
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,456
I... You know, I don't think
he ever once in his life...

861
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,451
made his own choice.

862
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:47,218
I never knew it was like that.

863
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,370
I mean, up in the palace...

864
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,499
Well, I guess we just let the general
make all the decisions.

865
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:59,737
Let me ask you something. What
made you come to the bar that night?

866
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,335
I guess I was looking
for a little trouble.

867
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,412
Well, (Chuckles)
trouble's my middle name.

868
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,176
Actually, my middle name is Marion,
but... don't spread that around.

869
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,377
You're pretty strange.
You do know that?

870
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,896
Well... (Ahem) Strange
isn't the word I would use.

871
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,778
I like it.
You're not like anyone else.

872
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:25,695
Actually, now that you mention it,
there is a certain strangeness to me.

873
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:30,410
I mean, it's, you know, kind of
a bizarre quality. Some said "freak".

874
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,253
But it's, uh, you know, complimentary.

875
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,372
Hey, new guy!

876
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,212
We need more wood.

877
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,777
I'll be right back.
Just hold that thought...

878
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,818
whatever it is you were thinking.

879
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,495
Hey, you ever wonder why
they call you guys "pests"?

880
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,334
(Mosquito) What if, like,
we're just these tiny things...

881
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:00,698
and we're just, like, part of
this whole other huge universe...

882
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,090
that's, like, so big
we don't even know it exists?

883
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,132
(Ladybug chuckles)
Man, that is so deep.

884
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,494
Perfect.
Nothing like manual labour...

885
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,498
on the most romantic night
of my life.

886
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,411
(Buzzing)

887
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:22,212
Hi. I was in the neighbourhood
and I thought I'd drop in.

888
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,568
This is, uh, very bohemian.

889
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,730
Aloha, dude. Welcome to Insec...

890
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,050
- (Groans)
- (Insects gasp)

891
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,689
Sorry for interrupting.

892
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:40,410
You see, our princess has,
uh, gone missing,

893
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,650
and we're just sick about it.

894
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,929
She's about yea tall,
fairly easy on the eyes.

895
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,217
- Anybody seen her?
- (All) That's her.

896
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:56,410
Don't worry, Princess,
you'll be back home soon.

897
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,731
Listen, Cutter, I'm...
I'm not going back.

898
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,256
(Sighs) The thing is, Princess,
I got orders.

899
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,379
Orders? Can't you just once
think for yourself?

900
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,449
Well, that was very impressive.
Where's Z?

901
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,890
- Z? He's, uh...
- Dead.

902
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,695
Z's dead.
You don't need to worry about him.

903
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:25,535
Z's dead.
Well, he was an ant with ideas.

904
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,372
Too bad for him.

905
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,099
Princess, your colony needs you.

906
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,296
- (Grunting)
- (Bala) Cutter!

907
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,452
- Stop right now! Let go of me!
- Bala!

908
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,457
Stop, you...

909
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,939
Oh, no.

910
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,773
(Muttering) What am I gonna do?

911
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,057
All right, look.
Let's be rational about this.

912
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,052
You know, Bala and I,
she's a princess...

913
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:51,291
and I'm a...
I'm a soil-relocation engineer.

914
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,656
So... You know...
On the other hand, uh...

915
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,459
I've gotta go back for her.

916
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:00,458
(Chippie, drunk)
I'll... give you a lift.

917
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,657
Sss... Whoa! Ohh!

918
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,935
It's the least I can do.

919
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:11,458
Besides... it's what my waddly-kiddles
would want.

920
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,656
(Sniffling and sobbing)

921
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,618
Uh, look, how about
a cup of joe...?

922
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,534
- Well, old boy... saddle up.
- I saw a puddle of coffee there.

923
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,975
It... Whoa!

924
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,937
(Both groaning)

925
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,617
(Z) Look out!

926
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,334
(Bala grunting)

927
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,615
Ah, Princess.

928
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:39,136
- You're just in time.
- Take your hands off me!

929
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,688
General, what is going on here?

930
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,659
- I DEMAND an explanation.
- I'll explain... afterwards.

931
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,698
- Is the south-east entrance secure?
- Yes, sir.

932
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,577
Not afterwards. Now.

933
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:58,293
I don't like the way you think
or the way you run this colony.

934
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:01,611
And I don't like you.
The wedding is off.

935
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,773
- Things are going to change here.
- You're right, Princess.

936
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,853
Things are going to change.
Make her more comfortable.

937
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,569
- (Gasps)
- She'll be here for a while.

938
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:17,573
What do you think you're doing?
My mother will have your head.

939
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:22,654
I doubt that. (Chuckles) Ah, you've
got a fighter spirit, Bala.

940
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,652
Just what we need
to start our new colony.

941
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,652
We'll rinse away
the filth from our gutters.

942
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,971
We'll start anew,
with you by my side as my queen.

943
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,051
You're crazy.

944
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,377
I believe history
will see things differently.

945
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,532
All right, gentlemen.
Take your positions.

946
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,134
Someday... someday you'll thank me.

947
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,133
(Chippie and Z moaning)

948
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:58,132
(Z) Pull up! Pull up!
Aah! There it is!

949
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,336
(Chippie mutters and hiccups)

950
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,735
Oof! (Coughs) Oh!

951
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:07,052
Well, then, go get
the woman you love, Z.

952
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,449
So long, Chip. And thanks.

953
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,018
You there.
Where do you think you're goin'?

954
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,694
Me? Oh, no, I was just...
You know, I...

955
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,816
You're not supposed to be here.

956
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,779
Workers are to report
to the tunnel-opening ceremonies.

957
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:31,298
Yes, yes, of course. Well, I should
get going, then. I... (Ahem)

958
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,052
You know, the-the...

959
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,334
(Soldier) Hey!

960
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:37,457
- I'm going to the... the t-tunnel...

961
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,371
- Get moving.
- Better get...

962
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,975
I'm going to the
tunnel-opening ceremonies...

963
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,860
Excuse me, please.
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

964
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:49,818
- Hey!
- Opening the tunnel. They need me.

965
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,460
- I'm the key man.
- Where are you going?

966
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,735
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

967
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,571
- (Crashing)
- (Bala) Hey! Let me outta here!

968
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,093
Hey!

969
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,459
Gosh, this-this day just keeps
getting better and better.

970
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,014
(Bala shouting in distance)

971
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:19,453
(Bala) Are you listening to me
out there? I'm the princess!

972
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,337
Damn it!

973
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,090
- Wow, your manners haven't improved.
- Z!

974
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,535
(Gasps) Whoa! Whoa!

975
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,692
- (Gasps) Ooh!
- It's you. You came back for me.

976
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:38,376
Well, yeah, I came back for you.
I have strong feelings for you.

977
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:42,339
Let's face it, you're... you're...
you're beautiful...

978
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:46,413
A little combative at times,
but I think we can work on that.

979
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,092
You talk too much.

980
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,778
Gee, I think I'm about to become
the strong, silent type.

981
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,979
Come on. The city's deserted.
We'd better get outta here.

982
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:03,052
Z... (Sighs) We can't go.

983
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,735
Mandible's insane.
He... he keeps talking about...

984
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:10,654
washing away the filth
and-and changing history and...

985
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,857
and I think he's going to try
to kill my mother.

986
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,693
(Z) Not just your mother... everyone.

987
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,930
- What's going on?
- Look.

988
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,976
Here we are, safe in the city.

989
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,893
But they're gonna seal
everybody off in the MegaTunnel.

990
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:25,936
And... here's the lake.

991
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,375
You're right.

992
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,655
We can't leave now.

993
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,810
Come on. We gotta get down there.

994
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:37,256
Today is the realisation of a dream.

995
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,570
A dream of a proud colony.

996
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:43,733
A pure colony. A colony reborn.

997
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,856
(Cheering)

998
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:51,416
Moments from now
this tunnel will open.

999
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,334
The past will be washed away
and a new day will dawn.

1000
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,376
(Cheering)

1001
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,451
A stirring speech, General.

1002
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:02,737
I wish my daughter
were here to appreciate it.

1003
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:06,733
Your Majesty, I know
how concerned you are about Bala.

1004
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,288
But my scouts
are on her trail and...

1005
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,213
I don't want to discuss it.
Just find her.

1006
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,655
I will, Your Highness.

1007
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,531
Goodbye.

1008
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,937
(Soldiers talking)

1009
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:30,571
(Ants chattering)

1010
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,779
Seal up the doors.

1011
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:39,297
- Cutter, did you hear me?
- Sir, I've been thinking.

1012
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:43,658
Do we need to do this?
Look at what these workers have done.

1013
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,369
They got the right stuff.
Isn't there any other way?

1014
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,576
Cutter, you're a fine officer.

1015
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,493
You have discipline,
courage, ability.

1016
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:57,096
But you seem to have a weakness for
the lower orders I find disturbing.

1017
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,695
- Now, are you with me?
- Sir, uh... I apologise.

1018
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:03,692
- All right, then. Seal it up.
- Yes, sir.

1019
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,932
(Grunting)

1020
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,410
(Queen) As I look out
on this magnificent tunnel,

1021
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,570
I am filled with pride.

1022
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,458
- (Z) Jump!
- In these difficult times,

1023
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:28,010
it is a great solace to know
that you, our workers...

1024
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,409
- (Queen continues)
- Mom! Wait!

1025
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,778
Every worker in the colony is here.
Hey, that guy owes me money.

1026
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:39,331
(Queen) This tremendous
accomplishment is a testimony to...

1027
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,379
Go warn your mother.
I've gotta get to those diggers.

1028
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:47,339
- There's not enough time.
- Leave the pessimism to me, OK?

1029
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,251
- (Queen continuing)
- Ow!

1030
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,898
- Ooh!
- Yeeow!

1031
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,448
Excuse me! Sorry. Excuse me.

1032
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:56,657
When our expert diggers
break through to the surface...

1033
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,095
- Mom! Stop!
- The sun will pour in...

1034
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:02,217
Bala! Where've you been?
Are you all right?

1035
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,450
- I'm fine.
- What happened?

1036
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:07,140
Mother, we're in terrible danger.

1037
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,372
(Panting)

1038
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,337
(Sighs)

1039
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,809
Put your backs into it, people!

1040
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,539
Wait! Hold... Hey, stop digging!

1041
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,770
- Z? Is that you?
- We must stop!

1042
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,135
- Z! You're back!
- (Bones crunch)

1043
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,370
- Oh, Z! Oh.
- (Gasping) Weaver!

1044
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,497
Z! What's the matter?

1045
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,811
H-hold up, everyone.
Stop! Stop digging.

1046
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,460
- On whose authority?
- Your own authority.

1047
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,656
If you break through, we'll...

1048
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,049
Drown. This tunnel is going to flood.

1049
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,290
We've got to get everyone out.

1050
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,291
(All murmuring)

1051
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:51,895
Look, I got orders,
and those orders say "dig".

1052
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:55,370
What if someone ordered you
to jump off a bridge?

1053
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:59,214
Oh, I'm asking the wrong guy here.
Look, think for yourselves!

1054
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,053
Gimme that!
I've had enough out of you.

1055
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,096
Get back to work.

1056
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,410
(Weaver) What's that noise?

1057
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,615
Uh-oh.

1058
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,416
- Let's get outta here!
- Run!

1059
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,297
(All screaming)

1060
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,689
(Weaver) Run! Keep going!

1061
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:20,375
Everyone, listen to me.
We've all been deceived.

1062
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,618
We need to calmly
head toward the exits.

1063
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,897
- Run for your lives! Flood!
- No. Don't panic.

1064
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:31,177
- Don't panic!
- Every ant for himself!

1065
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,137
(Gasps)

1066
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,176
(All screaming)

1067
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,175
All the exits are blocked!

1068
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,211
- What do we do?
- There's nothing we can do!

1069
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,853
Yes, there is.
Weaver, give me a leg up.

1070
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:20,852
Everyone, listen to me!

1071
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:23,408
- Who the heck are you?
- He's Z!

1072
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,776
(All murmuring)

1073
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:30,978
Listen, we gotta help each other
get out before we all drown.

1074
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:33,255
- How?
- By making a ladder.

1075
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,534
A ladder!

1076
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:37,373
Hey, if we built this,
we can do anything.

1077
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,691
- OK, let's move it!
- All of you, gather round.

1078
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,338
You, start climbing.

1079
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,530
- Grab my arm.
- All right. Here I go.

1080
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,975
- Go, go, go!
- Right!

1081
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:53,930
- Excuse me, Your Majesty.
- (Grunting)

1082
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,699
Z, I've gotta help my Mom.

1083
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,568
Don't worry. I know almost
exactly what I'm doing.

1084
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,971
I'll see you at the top.

1085
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:11,057
(Mandible) Gentlemen,
there comes a time...

1086
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,290
in the evolution of a colony...

1087
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:17,168
when the strong are meant
to rise above the weak.

1088
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,656
Now is that time.

Oh, God, we're not gonna make it.

1093
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,816
- We need more ants.
- You two better get up there.

1094
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,130
Weaver, you can't hold it alone.

1095

Get going.

1096

Hang in there, buddy.

1097

- Got it!
- Hurry up! Go, go, go, go!

(Gasps)

1099

Our princess is secure,
and a glorious future is at hand.

1100

We can all stand proud.

- (Soldiers gasp)
- What the hell is that?

I think that's the weak element, sir.

1104

- Gimme... gimme a hand!
- Z! You?

1105
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:35,217
Let go! Don't you understand?
It's for the good of the colony!

We are the colony!

01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:47,977
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

1110
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,654
This is for the good
of the colony, sir.

1111

You useless, ungrateful maggot!

1112

I am the colony!

Men, let's move it!
Get these ants up here.

1117
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:20,812
- Keep it moving.
- Thank goodness we made it.

1118
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,777
Wait here.

1119
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,858
- Uhh! OK.
- Thank you.

1120

Weaver.

1121
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,012
Where's Z?

1122
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,134
Oh, no.

1123
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:54,098
(Weaver) Back up, everybody, back up!

1124
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,968
- Give him some air. Back up.
- Z, oh, Z.

1125
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:03,458

you still owe me that dinner.

1132

- (Kissing)
- Babylove.

- You da ant!

- Eh!
- You did it.

1135
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,216
We did it.

1136

- Oh!
- Fellas! Fellas, please!

1137

- This is very embarrassing!
- (Laughing)
