1
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,419
Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?

2
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:06,465
She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.

3
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,793
- Sending meals up to her regularly?
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:10,761
Why don't you jam it down her throat?

5
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:12,639
It's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.

6
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:16,508
I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

7
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,265
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:22,102
I won't eat a thing
until you let me off this boat.

9
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,730
Come now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.

10
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:28,028
Not this time, you won't!
I'm already married to him.

11
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:30,440
You'll never live
under the same roof with him.

12
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:31,447
I'll see to it.

13
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:34,328
Get it through your head,
King Westley and I are married!

14
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:37,995
Definitely, legally, actually married!
It's over, it's finished.

15
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:41,368
There's not a thing you can do about it.
I'm over 21 and so is he.

16
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:43,003
While you've been onboard...

17
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:46,042
...I've arranged to
have your marriage annulled.

18
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:49,466
Annulled. I'll have something to say
about that and so will King.

19
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:50,928
I expect him to.

20
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:55,047
The vittles. Come in.

21
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:57,632
I told you not to bring any food in here.

22
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,927
Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.

23
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:01,225
Put it down here.

24
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:12,445
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

25
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,196
Strategy, my dear.

26
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:17,037
Was it strategy sending
those gorillas to drag me away...

27
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:18,664
...from the Justice of the Peace?

28
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:20,871
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.

29
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,666
I've won many arguments that way.

30
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:26,086
Besides not liking him,
you haven't got a thing against King.

31
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:29,334
- He's a fake.
- He's one of the best flyers in the country.

32
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:31,999
He's no good.
You married him because I said not to.

33
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:34,259
You're always telling me what not to do.

34
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:36,386
Because you've always been
a stubborn idiot.

35
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:38,680
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots.

36
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:41,852
Don't shout so.
You may work up an appetite.

37
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:44,559
I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!

38
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:45,728
All right, scream.

39
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:49,268
Let me off this boat or I'll break
every piece of furniture in here!

40
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:50,939
Here, now.

41
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,066
Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
You don't have to eat it.

42
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:56,234
Just smell it. It's a poem.

43
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:16,470
Lower the boats! Catch her!

44
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:18,848
Come on, men!

45
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:24,559
She got away, sir.

46
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:26,639
Of course, she's too smart for you.

47
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:29,770
Send a wireless
to the Lovington Detective Agency.

48
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,939
"Daughter escaped again.

49
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:33,566
"Watch roads,
airports and train stations in Miami."

50
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:39,407
All aboard!
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...

51
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:42,326
...New York, Philadelphia.

52
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:45,451
We're wasting our time.
Imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus.

53
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,286
I told the old man it was bunk.

54
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:48,998
Ticket for New York, please.

55
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:56,427
- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,680
Thank you.

57
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,350
What's going on here?
I'd like to use that phone.

58
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,310
Go away. This is history in the making.

59
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:13,977
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.

60
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,396
Heel, boy.

61
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,488
I can't stand this any longer.

62
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,617
In a pig's eye, you will.

63
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:25,696
Listen monkey face, when you fired me,
you fired the best news hound...

64
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,406
...your filthy scandal sheet ever had.

65
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,793
You wouldn't know a newspaper story
if it kicked you in the pants.

66
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,747
I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna write it in Greek?

67
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,171
I'd start a new department.

68
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,586
That was free verse,
you gas house palooka.

69
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,841
What was free about it?
It cost this paper a gob of dough.

70
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:44,724
And it's not going to cost us any more!

71
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:45,842
Gordon.

72
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,727
Did you know he reversed the charge?

73
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,639
What? Why you....

74
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:54,894
When you get back to New York,
you keep far away from this office.

75
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,150
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore and you never will.

76
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,992
What'd he say?

77
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:07,323
So, you're changing your tune?

78
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,036
You're late with your apologies.

79
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,876
I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged me on your hands and knees!

80
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:16,880
I hope this'll be a lesson to you.

81
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,761
Did we tell that baby?

82
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,837
- We don't need anymore of his lip.
- You told him, Pete.

83
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:27,139
I guess he knows now,
how I feel about his job.

84
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,851
I bet he does, too.

85
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:30,596
Is my chariot ready?

86
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:33,808
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth,
mighty King.

87
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:38,231
- Lead on, sire.
- Make way for the king.

88
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:40,189
Make way for the king.

89
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,072
Long live the king.

90
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,241
Philadelphia, all aboard!

91
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:55,253
Step down Marty, King is back.

92
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,745
On the rack in the back.
It's your goodbye chariot.

93
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,666
Make hams of you and scram!

94
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:04,547
Two thousand miles is a long trip.

95
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,100
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

96
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,465
Pillow, sir?

97
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:22,362
Driver! If you'll be good enough
to move those newspapers, I'll have a seat.

98
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,873
Hey, wait a minute!

99
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:38,747
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:42,008
The papers. What's the idea of
throwing them out?

101
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:45,212
The papers? It's a long story, my friend.

102
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,795
I never did like the idea
of sitting on newspapers.

103
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,590
I did it once, and all the headlines
came off on my white pants.

104
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:54,935
It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

105
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:58,854
They followed me all over town and read
the news off the seat of my pants.

106
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:02,442
A fresh guy. What you need is
a good sock on the nose.

107
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,322
Listen partner,
you may not like my nose, but I do.

108
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:11,826
I always wear it out in the open so...

109
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:14,583
...if anybody wants to
take a sock at it, they can.

110
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:16,834
Yeah?

111
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,915
Now, that's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?

112
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,628
Our conversation could have been over
long ago.

113
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,922
Yeah?

114
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,675
If you keep that up,
we won't get anywhere.

115
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:30,468
Yeah?

116
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:34,217
You got me. Yeah!

117
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:47,025
Excuse me, lady.
But that upon which you sit is mine.

118
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,944
I beg your pardon?

119
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,608
Now listen,
I put up a stiff fight for that seat.

120
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,659
So, if it's just the same to you, scram.

121
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,247
Driver, are these seats reserved?

122
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:02,870
- No. First come, first serve.
- Thank you.

123
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:06,459
These seats accommodate two people,
don't they?

124
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,378
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

125
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:09,542
Thank you.

126
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:13,884
Move over.

127
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:17,801
This is a "maybe they do."

128
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:29,066
If you'd ask me real nice,
I might put that bag up there for you.

129
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:50,087
Next time you drop in, bring your folks.

130
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,523
Get some! Come on, everybody!

131
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,867
Hot dogs, folks!

132
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:21,620
Rest station, 15 minutes.
We'll only be here 15 minutes.

133
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,084
Red hot coffee!

134
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:25,622
Right around there.

135
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,752
Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!

136
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,876
Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!

137
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:14,166
He got away.

138
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:17,554
I found myself in the middle of brush
and no sign of the skunk.

139
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,011
I don't know what you're raving about,
young man.

140
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,800
- Furthermore, I'm not interested.
- Well of all the....

141
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:27,641
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag is gone.

142
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,856
My heavens! It's gone!

143
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:31,521
I knew you'd catch on eventually.

144
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:36,566
- What am I going to do now?
- Don't tell me your ticket was in it.

145
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:41,284
No, got that all right. But not my money.
All I have here is $4.

146
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:43,494
You can wire home
for money in Jacksonville.

147
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:44,696
No, I can't.

148
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,625
- Yes, I guess I will.
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.

149
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:50,621
Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.

150
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:54,165
Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag.
The company should pay for it.

151
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,880
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported!

152
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,378
That's silly.
The company will take care of it.

153
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:03,600
Can you understand English?
Would you please keep out of my affairs?

154
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,724
I want to be left alone.

155
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:11,480
Why, you ungrateful brat.

156
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:13,515
Board!

157
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:15,398
All aboard!

158
00:12:58,465 --> 00:12:59,746
Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.

159
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:01,882
Only 30 minutes for breakfast.

160
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:05,669
Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.

161
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,140
Read all about it!

162
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:36,208
I'm so sorry.

163
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,872
Silly, isn't it?

164
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,797
Why, everybody's gone!

165
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:47,636
Thank you for that, very much.

166
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:52,470
- We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
- Yes.

167
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:56,765
That was foolish of me.

168
00:13:57,732 --> 00:14:00,270
Why didn't you shove me away?

169
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:04,562
I hated to wake you up.
You look kind of pretty asleep.

170
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,568
How about some breakfast?

171
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:12,662
No thank you. No, I'm going
to the Windsor Hotel.

172
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:16,996
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in a half an hour.

173
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:19,125
No, they'll wait for me.

174
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:25,713
Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes late.
Be sure to wait for me.

175
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:27,006
Yeah?

176
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,793
Yes.

177
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,868
Where's the bus to New York?

178
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,620
It left about 20 minutes ago.

179
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:58,995
But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.

180
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:01,749
I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.

181
00:15:02,046 --> 00:15:06,375
Good morning. Remember me?
I'm the fellow you slept on last night.

182
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:10,841
Seems to me,
I've already thanked you for that.

183
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:12,383
What time's the next bus?

184
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:13,967
8:00 tonight.

185
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:17,059
8:00? That's 12 hours.

186
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:18,770
Sorry, miss.

187
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,775
What's wrong?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

188
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:25,315
Why are you so excited?
You missed it, too.

189
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:27,110
Yeah, I missed it too.

190
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:31,193
Don't tell me you did it on my account.

191
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:35,824
I hope you haven't any idea
that what happened last night is....

192
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:38,946
Young man,
you needn't concern yourself about me.

193
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,666
I can take care of myself.

194
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:44,625
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.
Here's your ticket.

195
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:46,501
My ticket?

196
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:48,624
I found it on the seat.

197
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:55,757
Thank you.
It must have fallen out of my purse.

198
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:00,894
You'll never get away with it,
Miss Andrews.

199
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:05,017
- What are you talking about?
- You won't get away with it.

200
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:08,727
Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.

201
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,569
You must have me confused
with someone else.

202
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,946
Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.

203
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:21,831
I've always been curious to know...

204
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:26,045
...what kind of a girl would marry
a front-page aviator like King Westley.

205
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:30,626
Take my advice. Grab the next bus back
to Miami. That guy's a phoney.

206
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:34,257
I didn't ask for your advice.

207
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,094
That's right. You didn't.

208
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,592
You're not going to notify my father,
are you?

209
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:42,014
What for?

210
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:45,101
You probably could get
some money out of him.

211
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,560
I never thought of that.

212
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,315
If you promise not to do it,
I'll pay you as much as he will.

213
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:52,236
You won't gain a thing by giving me up.

214
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:54,445
I'm willing to make it worth your while.

215
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:56,905
I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.

216
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:58,904
It's very important to me.

217
00:16:58,995 --> 00:17:00,739
I'd pay you now, only...

218
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,368
...all I had when I jumped off
the yacht was a watch.

219
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,534
I had to pawn it to get these clothes.

220
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:08,581
I'll give you my address.
You can contact me in New York.

221
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,083
Never mind.

222
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,713
I had you pegged right from the jump.

223
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:18,012
Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.
The only way you get anything is to buy it.

224
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:22,219
You're in a jam and all you can think of is
your money. It never fails, does it?

225
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:24,684
Ever hear of the word "humility"?

226
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:26,265
No, you wouldn't.

227
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,147
It never occurred to you to say...

228
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,068
..."Please, Mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?"

229
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:33,726
That'd bring you down off your high horse.

230
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:36,229
I'll tell you something to ease your mind.

231
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:37,902
You don't have to worry about me.

232
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:40,650
I'm not interested in your money
or your problem.

233
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:44,873
You, King Westley, your father.
You're all a lot of hooey to me.

234
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:52,421
You send telegrams here?

235
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:55,836
I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?

236
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:03,008
"To Joe Gordon,
in care of New York Mail, New York.

237
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,181
"Am I laughing. The biggest scoop
of the year just dropped in my lap.

238
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:10,849
"I know where Ellen Andrews is."
No, do you really?

239
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,976
Go on. Send the telegram.

240
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:18,109
"How would you like to have the story?
You big tub of...."

241
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,402
Mush.

242
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:22,735
"Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.

243
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:26,447
"What I said about never writing
another line for you still goes.

244
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,533
"Are you burning? Peter Warne."

245
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:30,453
That'll be $2.60.

246
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,667
- Send it collect.
- Collect?

247
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:34,035
Collect.

248
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:44,760
Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston,
Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond...

249
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,144
...Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York....

250
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:18,712
Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.
May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.

251
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:21,175
Gets tiresome.
Especially for somebody like you.

252
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:23,007
You look like you've got class.

253
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,844
Yes, with a capital "K". I'm the guy
that knows class when he sees it.

254
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:31,520
Believe you me. Ask any of the boys.
They'll tell you.

255
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:33,481
Shapeley sure knows how to pick them.

256
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:36,902
Shapeley's the name
and that's the way I like them.

257
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:38,856
You made no mistake sitting next to me.

258
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:40,691
Most girls you meet on the bus...

259
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:43,108
...ain't nothing to write home
to the wife about.

260
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:46,120
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

261
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:48,613
You can't be too particular, neither.

262
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,080
What's the matter, you ain't saying much?

263
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:55,083
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

264
00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,714
That's pretty good. "Seems to me you're
doing excellently without any assistance."

265
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:03,217
Well shut my big, nasty mouth.

266
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:06,217
Looks like you're one up on me.

267
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:09,393
There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

268
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:13,690
...that can snap back at you.
The colder they are, the hotter they get.

269
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:15,316
That's what I always say.

270
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:17,193
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:21,358
When a cold mama gets hot,
boy how she sizzles.

272
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:25,650
Now you're just my type.

273
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:28,948
Believe me, sister,
I could go for you in a big way.

274
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,246
"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley," they call me.
With accent on the "fun". Believe you me.

275
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:37,748
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

276
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:42,582
Looks like you're two up on me now.

277
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:43,877
Hey, you.

278
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:48,842
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?

279
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:52,475
I'd like to sit next to my wife,
if you don't mind.

280
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,058
- Your wife?
- Yes.

281
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:56,013
Come on.

282
00:20:56,567 --> 00:21:00,398
Yeah. Sure, excuse me.
You know, I was just....

283
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:04,105
Sure. Excuse me, miss.
I was just trying to make things pleasant.

284
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:05,731
Excuse me, I....

285
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:08,317
I didn't mean anything, Doc.

286
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,574
- No offence, Doc.
- No.

287
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:21,873
If you promise not to snap my head off,
I'd like to thank you.

288
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:26,172
Forget it. I didn't do it for you.
His voice gets on my nerves.

289
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,637
What'd you do all day?

290
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:39,354
Ran in and out of doorways.
Trying to keep out of the rain.

291
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,146
Your clothes are all wet.

292
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:47,319
Here.

293
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,282
You're as helpless as a baby.

294
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,484
Thank you.

295
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:56,574
Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes,
chewing gum, candy, magazines.

296
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:58,126
Here, boy.

297
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:02,752
- Yes, ma'am.
- A box of chocolates, please.

298
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:05,414
- Never mind. She doesn't want it.
- But....

299
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,131
- Of course, I do. What do you mean?
- Beat it.

300
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:11,306
Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!

301
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:15,101
$1 .60.

302
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:17,853
You had $4 last night.

303
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:20,724
How will you get to New York at this rate?

304
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,272
That's none of your business.

305
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:26,025
You're on a budget from now on.

306
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:29,567
- Just a minute. You can't--
- Shut up.

307
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:54,344
- What's the matter, officer?
- Bridge washed out.

308
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,759
Looks like we can't get through
till morning.

309
00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:59,219
If any passengers want a place to sleep...

310
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:01,685
...you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.

311
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:04,146
- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?

312
00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:06,641
Dyke's Auto camp.

313
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,021
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.

314
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,151
Are you talking to me?

315
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,857
Yeah. Come on,
we're stopping here for the night.

316
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,714
Hey! Come on, we're all set.

317
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:47,773
Good evening. Hope you
and your husband rest comfortable.

318
00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:59,495
Come on! What are you going to do,
stay out there all night?

319
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,554
Darn clever, these Armenians?

320
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:24,556
Yeah, it's a gift.

321
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,988
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to as my husband.

322
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:36,319
Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that.
I registered as Mr. and Mrs.

323
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:37,738
You did?

324
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:42,324
What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?

325
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:45,329
I kind of half expected you to thank me.

326
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:49,046
Your ego is absolutely colossal.

327
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:51,835
Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?

328
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:02,756
You know, compared to you,
my friend Shapeley's an amateur.

329
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:07,853
Just whatever gave you any idea
I'd stand for this?

330
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:11,981
Now wait a minute.
Let's get this straightened out right now.

331
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:15,778
If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.

332
00:25:15,865 --> 00:25:18,154
You're just a headline to me.

333
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,077
A headline?

334
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,155
You're not a newspaper man, are you?

335
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,407
Chalk up one for your side.

336
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,745
Now listen. You want to
get to King Westley, don't you?

337
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:33,628
All right, I'm here to help you.
What I want is your story.

338
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,842
Exclusive. A day-to-day account.
All about your mad fight to happiness.

339
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:43,096
I need that story.
Between you and me, I've got to have it.

340
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:49,433
Isn't that just too cute.

341
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:53,483
There's a brain behind that face of yours,
isn't there?

342
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:58,857
You've got everything nicely figured out
for yourself. Including this.

343
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:02,069
This? Well, that's a matter
of simple mathematics.

344
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:06,490
These cabins cost $2 a night.
I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear...

345
00:26:06,624 --> 00:26:10,668
...but the family purse won't stand
for our having separate establishment.

346
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:20,672
Thank you very much, sir.
You've been very kind.

347
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:23,462
It's all right with me.
Go on out in the storm.

348
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:25,514
But I'm going to follow you.

349
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:26,632
Yeah.

350
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:31,935
And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn
you over to your old man. Right now.

351
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:35,559
Savvy? That's my whole plot in a nutshell.

352
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,854
A simple story for simple people.

353
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,695
You behave yourself,
I'll see you get to King Westley.

354
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:45,904
If not,
I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.

355
00:26:47,081 --> 00:26:50,117
Now, which of these beds do you prefer?

356
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,286
This one? All right.

357
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:19,776
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

358
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:21,478
This?

359
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:28,278
I like privacy when I retire.
Yes, I'm very delicate in that respect.

360
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:29,996
Prying eyes annoy me.

361
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,377
Behold the walls of Jericho.

362
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:40,630
Maybe not as thick as the ones
that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.

363
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,218
But a lot safer.

364
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:45,089
You see, I have no trumpet.

365
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:48,635
Now to show you
my heart's in the right place...

366
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:51,298
...I'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.

367
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:55,638
Do you mind joining the Israelites?

368
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:58,731
You don't want to join the Israelites?

369
00:27:58,818 --> 00:28:02,519
All right. Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

370
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:06,943
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

371
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:08,909
No two men do it alike.

372
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,785
I once knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

373
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,874
Now he made a picture.

374
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:18,500
Years later, his secret came out.
He wore a toupee.

375
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,422
I have a method all my own.

376
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:26,714
If you'll notice, the coat came first.
Then the tie. Then the shirt.

377
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:31,386
Now, according to Hoyle,
after that the pants should be next.

378
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:33,845
There's where I'm different.

379
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,852
I go for the shoes next.

380
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:38,768
First the right. Then the left.

381
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:44,321
After that, it's every man for himself.

382
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,136
Still with me, brat?

383
00:29:12,224 --> 00:29:14,217
Don't be a sucker.

384
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,261
A good night's rest will do you
a lot of good.

385
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:20,597
Besides, you got nothing to worry about.

386
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:24,689
The walls of Jericho will protect you
from the big bad wolf.

387
00:29:39,126 --> 00:29:43,124
"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
The big bad wolf

388
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:44,625
"The big bad wolf

389
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,000
"She's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra, la, la, la, la"

390
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:55,470
Would you mind please,
putting out the light?

391
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:57,101
No, not at all.

392
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:40,388
I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

393
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:42,186
Excuse me.

394
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:10,542
By the way, what's your name?

395
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:13,296
What's that?

396
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:15,260
Who are you?

397
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:17,598
Who, me?

398
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,602
I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.

399
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:26,060
I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

400
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,939
You've got a name, haven't you?

401
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:32,143
Yeah, I got a name. Peter Warne.

402
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,691
Peter Warne.

403
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:37,443
I don't like it.

404
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:41,663
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.

405
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,826
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.

406
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:48,873
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.

407
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:12,396
- Another message, sir.
- What is it? What is it?

408
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:15,404
It's from Charleston.
"Checking every northbound train.

409
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:18,022
"Also assigned 20 operators
to watch main highways.

410
00:32:18,117 --> 00:32:20,952
"No sign of her yet.
Will continue to do all possible.

411
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:22,946
"Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."

412
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:25,370
It's just the same as all the others.

413
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,793
- Yes, sir?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York.

414
00:32:28,878 --> 00:32:31,203
- What are we crawling for?
- I got it wide open.

415
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,455
- All right, step on it.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:35,257
I hope she's all right.

417
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:39,382
All right? Of course, she's all right.
What could happen to her?

418
00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:42,593
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it.

419
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:08,416
Hello?

420
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,288
Hey, mister.

421
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:17,800
Hello.

422
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:20,086
What's the matter, you not up yet?

423
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:22,877
- What time is it?
- 8:00. Here.

424
00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:27,223
It's a toothbrush, thanks.

425
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:30,468
My dress, you had it pressed.

426
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:33,187
Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.

427
00:33:33,316 --> 00:33:35,558
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

428
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:38,439
I'll count to 10.
If you're not out of bed by then...

429
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,238
...I'll drag you out myself.

430
00:33:40,324 --> 00:33:43,574
- One, two, three, four, five....
- I really think you would!

431
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,447
I'm out! I'm out!

432
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:50,124
You'll find the showers
just behind the second cottage.

433
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,491
Outside?

434
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:56,162
All the best homes have them outside.

435
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:01,298
I can't go out like this.

436
00:34:01,636 --> 00:34:04,306
- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.

437
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,097
Here, use mine.

438
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:08,637
Thanks.

439
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,931
Make it snappy.

440
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,427
Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.

441
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:15,524
- Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.

442
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:20,696
Where'd you say the showers were?

443
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,061
Here's a towel.

444
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:24,778
Thank you.

445
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:28,694
You're kind of little, aren't you?

446
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:30,153
Where's the shower?

447
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:32,917
Your hair's cute like that.
You should never comb it.

448
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,869
I'll find it myself.

449
00:35:07,702 --> 00:35:09,445
Are the showers in there?

450
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:11,328
They ain't out here.

451
00:35:11,747 --> 00:35:12,992
Thank you.

452
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:19,328
Can't a body have a little privacy
around here?

453
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,170
You want a shower around here,
you'll stand in line.

454
00:35:38,357 --> 00:35:41,192
Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?

455
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:43,270
Say, I'm sorry about last night.

456
00:35:43,362 --> 00:35:46,945
Didn't know you was married to that guy.
You should've told me right off.

457
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:58,452
High time you got back.

458
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:01,117
I met some very interesting women
at the showers.

459
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:04,754
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

460
00:36:09,012 --> 00:36:09,629
Come on. Sit down.

461
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:14,092
My, my. Scrambled eggs.

462
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:19,810
Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

463
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:21,394
Any complaints?

464
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,942
No. No complaints.

465
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:26,395
I'd have cream for your coffee,
but I'd be buying a whole pint.

466
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,404
You don't have to apologise to me.

467
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,779
You don't know how much
I appreciate all this.

468
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:33,780
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

469
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:35,367
Must be the spring.

470
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:38,741
I thought maybe "believe you me"
told you some more snappy stories.

471
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:43,163
No. He apologised for last night.
Said he didn't know we were married.

472
00:36:43,255 --> 00:36:46,374
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.

473
00:36:48,552 --> 00:36:50,176
- Donut?
- Thanks.

474
00:36:52,597 --> 00:36:54,804
You think this whole business is silly?

475
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:56,302
Running away and all.

476
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:58,101
No. Makes too good a story.

477
00:36:58,186 --> 00:37:01,769
Yes, you do.
You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.

478
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:04,520
Perhaps I am.
Although, I don't see how I can be.

479
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:06,934
Spoiled people are used to
having their way.

480
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:08,736
I never have. On the contrary.

481
00:37:08,822 --> 00:37:12,950
I've always been told what to do and how
to do it and when and with whom.

482
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:17,409
Can you believe, this is the first time
I've ever been alone with a man?

483
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:18,653
Yeah.

484
00:37:18,748 --> 00:37:20,907
It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.

485
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,874
You're doing all right.

486
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:24,117
Thanks.

487
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:32,007
Nurses, governesses, chaperones,
even bodyguards. It's been a lot of fun.

488
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:34,502
One consolation,
you can never get lonesome.

489
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:39,885
It has its moments. It's become a sort of
game, trying to outwit father's detectives.

490
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,935
I did once. Actually went shopping
without a bodyguard.

491
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:46,853
It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral.

492
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:49,979
It didn't last long,
they found me in a department store.

493
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:54,199
I was so mad, I ran out the back way
and jumped into the first car I saw.

494
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:55,689
Guess who was in it?

495
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:57,113
Santa Claus?

496
00:37:57,453 --> 00:37:58,484
Ghandi?

497
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,572
King Westley was in it.

498
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,790
- Is that how you met him?
- Yes.

499
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:07,039
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

500
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,249
By 6:00,
he was having all the rivers dragged.

501
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:15,178
Where'd you learn to dunk,
in finishing school?

502
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:17,754
Now don't you start telling me
I shouldn't dunk.

503
00:38:17,848 --> 00:38:20,221
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.

504
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:24,852
Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.
A dip and sock, into your mouth.

505
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:27,690
You leave it in too long,
it gets soft and falls off.

506
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:31,358
It's all a matter of timing.
I'll write a book about it.

507
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:32,726
Thanks, professor.

508
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:36,564
Just goes to show you. $20 million,
and you don't know how to dunk.

509
00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:39,868
I'd change places with
a plumber's daughter any day.

510
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:43,453
How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.

511
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:48,162
You can't go around bothering my tenants.
There's no girl by that name here.

512
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,579
How do I know you're detectives?

513
00:38:50,673 --> 00:38:52,749
Show him your credentials, Mac.

514
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:56,460
Detectives.

515
00:38:57,596 --> 00:39:00,633
That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?

516
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:03,476
Maybe I can jump out of the window.
They won't see me.

517
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,055
Get yourself all mussed up.

518
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:07,932
Get your hair down over your eyes
and undo your buttons.

519
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:11,681
I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.

520
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:15,276
She said if we don't stop over
in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.

521
00:39:15,364 --> 00:39:16,988
What are you talking about?

522
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:20,652
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

523
00:39:21,078 --> 00:39:24,945
She saw your sister on the street
the other day. Said she's looking swell.

524
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:29,456
Come in.

525
00:39:29,544 --> 00:39:32,296
I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?

526
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:36,425
Grandma says it's gonna be a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

527
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:39,046
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

528
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:40,929
Who, me? You wanna see me?

529
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:42,390
What's your name?

530
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:45,927
- Are you addressing me?
- Yeah. What's your name?

531
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:49,062
Wait a minute.
That's my wife you're talking to.

532
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:51,930
What do you mean coming here?
What do you want?

533
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:55,359
- We're looking for somebody.
- Fine, but don't come busting in here.

534
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:56,524
This isn't a public park.

535
00:39:56,613 --> 00:39:58,404
I got news to take a sock at you.

536
00:39:58,532 --> 00:40:00,571
- Take it easy.
- The men are detectives.

537
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,817
Even if they're the
whole police department...

538
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:05,153
...they can't bust in here,
questioning my wife.

539
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:07,998
Don't get so excited.
He asked you a simple question.

540
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:12,875
Is that so? How many times
have I told you not to butt in?

541
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:16,129
You don't have to lose your temper!

542
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:18,422
As usual. Every time I try to protect you.

543
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,594
At the elks dance,
when that big Swede hit on you.

544
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,968
He did not! I told you a million times.

545
00:40:24,057 --> 00:40:26,809
He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor.

546
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:28,518
He didn't. You were drunk.

547
00:40:28,603 --> 00:40:30,394
Nuts! Just like your old man.

548
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,185
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

549
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:35,397
There ain't an ounce of
brains in your family.

550
00:40:35,485 --> 00:40:37,276
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!

551
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:40,440
- Shut up!
- You see what you've done?

552
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:44,357
Sorry, but you see,
we've gotta check up on everybody.

553
00:40:44,452 --> 00:40:46,610
We're looking for a girl
named Ellen Andrews.

554
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:48,655
Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.

555
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:51,239
Too bad you're not looking for
a plumber's daughter.

556
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:52,828
Quit bawling!

557
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:56,752
I told you they were a perfectly
nice married couple.

558
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:12,476
You weren't bad, jumping in like that.

559
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:15,268
- You've got a brain.
- You're not so bad, yourself.

560
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:17,267
We could start a two-people
stock company.

561
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,111
Things get tough,
we'll play to small town auditoriums.

562
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:22,485
We'll call this one, "The Great Deception."

563
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:24,981
What about "Cinderella" or
a real hot love story?

564
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,238
No, too mushy.

565
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:28,118
I like mushy stuff.

566
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:30,365
Quit bawling!

567
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:32,826
Bus leaves in five minutes!

568
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,200
- What?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes.

569
00:41:35,294 --> 00:41:38,046
Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.

570
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:45,417
I'm starting to think
you couldn't find your way home.

571
00:41:45,513 --> 00:41:46,793
This is the last session....

572
00:41:47,098 --> 00:41:48,806
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.

573
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:51,346
- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.

574
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:56,182
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.
Wait a minute. What does it say?

575
00:41:57,274 --> 00:42:00,774
"Have I got a story. Stop.
It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.

576
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,943
"Hope you're the same."

577
00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:06,199
- Collect?
- Yes.

578
00:42:06,283 --> 00:42:08,988
- If you accept another one, you're fired.
- Yes, sir.

579
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:11,403
And that gives me an idea for all of you.

580
00:42:11,914 --> 00:42:13,741
I want action, Lovington, action.

581
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:16,750
- We can't do the impossible.
- It isn't impossible.

582
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:19,622
She's somewhere between here and Miami.
I want her found.

583
00:42:19,755 --> 00:42:22,424
- I put extra men on, the whole way.
- That's not enough.

584
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:23,836
Send in Clark and Brown.

585
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:26,381
- You sure she isn't with King Westley?
- No.

586
00:42:26,512 --> 00:42:29,299
He's being trailed 24 hours a day.

587
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,969
He can't even get a phone call
we don't know about.

588
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:35,178
I'm worried. After all,
something might have happened to her.

589
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,350
I don't think so.

590
00:42:36,438 --> 00:42:38,514
Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.

591
00:42:38,607 --> 00:42:40,896
Coast-to-coast hook up.
Offer a reward of...

592
00:42:40,984 --> 00:42:43,310
...$10,000 for information
on her whereabouts.

593
00:42:43,904 --> 00:42:46,311
Clark, send the story
to all of the newspapers.

594
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:49,117
Some out-of-town papers
may not have a picture of her.

595
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:52,570
Wire this to them.
I want the story to break right away.

596
00:42:53,288 --> 00:42:54,747
Now we'll get some action!

597
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:32,111
Fine, that's fine.

598
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:37,622
You know that one
about the man who flew on the trapeze?

599
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:39,750
Yeah.

600
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:48,956
"Once I was happy
but now I'm forlorn

601
00:43:49,177 --> 00:43:52,712
"Like an old coat
that is tattered and torn

602
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:56,723
"Left in this wide world
to weep and to mourn

603
00:43:57,518 --> 00:44:00,852
"Betrayed by a maid in her teens

604
00:44:01,314 --> 00:44:04,350
"This maid that I loved
she was handsome

605
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:08,900
"And I tried all I knew how to please

606
00:44:09,322 --> 00:44:12,857
"But I never could please her
one-quarter so well

607
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:17,030
"As the man on the flying trapeze

608
00:44:17,163 --> 00:44:20,864
"He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

609
00:44:21,084 --> 00:44:24,832
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

610
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:28,669
"His actions are graceful,
all the girls he does please

611
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:32,584
"And my love he has stolen away"

612
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:41,426
I know the second verse there.

613
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:47,306
"Now he'd play with a miss
like a cat with a mouse

614
00:44:47,777 --> 00:44:51,027
"His eyes would undress
every girl in the house

615
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:58,902
"Perhaps he is better described as a louse
And still people came just the same

616
00:44:59,121 --> 00:45:02,953
"Now he smiles from the bar
on the people below

617
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:06,245
"And one night he smiled on my love

618
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,831
"She blew him a kiss

619
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:15,128
"And she hollered bravo
And he hung by his schnozzle from above

620
00:45:15,304 --> 00:45:18,803
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

621
00:45:19,224 --> 00:45:24,515
"Daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful

622
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:30,773
"All the girls he does please
And my love he has stolen away"

623
00:45:33,238 --> 00:45:35,480
Do you mind if I take the third one?

624
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:44,489
"I wept and I whimpered
I simpered for weeks

625
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:48,284
"While she spent her time
with the circus' freaks

626
00:45:48,503 --> 00:45:52,335
"The tears were like hailstones
that rolled down my cheeks

627
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:55,586
"Alas, Alack and Alaska

628
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:59,635
"I went to this fellow
the villain, and I said

629
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:03,216
"I'll see that you get your deserts

630
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,892
"His thumb to his nose
he put up with a sneer

631
00:46:07,189 --> 00:46:10,807
"He sneered once again and said no

632
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:14,477
"He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

633
00:46:14,613 --> 00:46:17,697
"That daring young man

634
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:21,991
"His actions are graceful

635
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,785
"My love he has stolen away"

636
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:36,459
- Everybody keep your seats.
- Thank the man for me, Peter.

637
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:40,002
It's the first comfortable position
I've been in all night.

638
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:44,298
"She flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

639
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:46,017
"The daring young--"

640
00:46:47,645 --> 00:46:50,397
What's the matter with you?
Somebody help.

641
00:46:50,482 --> 00:46:52,106
Something happened to her.

642
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:53,852
Look how pale she is.

643
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:04,278
Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.

644
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,696
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

645
00:47:08,624 --> 00:47:11,329
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.

646
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:15,205
What happened to your money?

647
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:19,758
Ma spent it all on the tickets.
We didn't know it was gonna be so much.

648
00:47:20,803 --> 00:47:22,962
We shouldn't have come, I guess.

649
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:26,717
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

650
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:29,383
...and if we didn't go, she might lose it.

651
00:47:35,234 --> 00:47:37,939
She'll be all right
when she's had something to eat.

652
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:41,944
The next time we come to,
you buy some food. Now come on.

653
00:47:42,283 --> 00:47:45,616
I shouldn't ought to take this.
Ma'll get mad.

654
00:47:45,912 --> 00:47:48,829
Don't tell her.
You don't want her to get sick again.

655
00:47:48,914 --> 00:47:50,872
No, but you might need it.

656
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:51,872
Come on.

657
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:53,038
I got millions.

658
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:53,957
Here.

659
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:56,245
- Thanks.
- Come on, go back.

660
00:48:13,856 --> 00:48:15,480
Better phone for some help.

661
00:48:15,566 --> 00:48:18,602
Go phone if you want to.
The nearest town is 10 miles away.

662
00:48:18,736 --> 00:48:19,898
Yeah?

663
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:23,570
Say, buddy.
Like to take a look at my paper?

664
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:28,734
Travelling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

665
00:48:28,912 --> 00:48:31,154
Take that story there, for instance.

666
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:35,074
If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?

667
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:36,290
No.

668
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,543
I'd go fifty-fifty with you.

669
00:48:39,047 --> 00:48:39,877
Why?

670
00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:41,756
Because I don't believe in hogging.

671
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:45,127
A bird that figures that way
always ends up behind the eight ball.

672
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,964
That's what I always say.

673
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,725
What's on your mind?

674
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:54,182
Five G's or I crab the works.

675
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:03,314
Let's get away from here
and talk this over privately.

676
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:05,943
I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.

677
00:49:10,412 --> 00:49:13,164
Lucky thing, my running into you.
Just the man I need.

678
00:49:13,248 --> 00:49:16,534
- You made no mistake, believe me.
- I can use a smart guy like you.

679
00:49:16,626 --> 00:49:20,209
- When you're talking to old man Shapeley...
- Can you make a gat?

680
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:21,502
Huh?

681
00:49:21,923 --> 00:49:23,999
A gat. A rod.

682
00:49:24,634 --> 00:49:26,544
- Got any fireworks on you?
- No.

683
00:49:27,804 --> 00:49:31,849
I got a couple of machine guns
in my suitcase. I'll give you one of them.

684
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:35,053
May have trouble up north.
Have to shoot it out with the cops.

685
00:49:35,145 --> 00:49:38,596
If you manage, those five G's
are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.

686
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,979
I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.

687
00:49:41,151 --> 00:49:42,100
Killer?

688
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:44,940
Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.

689
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:47,563
You're not kidnapping her, are you?

690
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:51,447
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

691
00:49:51,536 --> 00:49:54,288
$10, 000? Chicken feed.

692
00:49:54,706 --> 00:49:58,205
Now listen, we're holding that dame
for a million smackers.

693
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:02,125
Say, I didn't know it was anything like this.
You see, I've got....

694
00:50:02,505 --> 00:50:04,913
What's the matter? You getting yellow?

695
00:50:05,008 --> 00:50:08,459
I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids.
I can't afford to get....

696
00:50:08,636 --> 00:50:10,962
Pipe down your mug before I....

697
00:50:11,556 --> 00:50:14,308
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

698
00:50:14,392 --> 00:50:17,595
Listen, you're into this thing
and you're staying in, get me?

699
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:19,229
You know too much.

700
00:50:19,314 --> 00:50:21,223
I won't say anything, honest I won't.

701
00:50:21,316 --> 00:50:24,316
How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.

702
00:50:24,569 --> 00:50:28,649
- Why should I take a chance with you?
- Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.

703
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,735
Yeah?

704
00:50:31,784 --> 00:50:33,326
What's your name?

705
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:34,995
Oscar Shapeley.

706
00:50:35,204 --> 00:50:37,660
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.

707
00:50:38,124 --> 00:50:39,784
Got a couple of kids?

708
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:43,328
Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl.

709
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:46,090
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

710
00:50:46,257 --> 00:50:48,131
You wouldn't. You're not thinking of--

711
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:50,755
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure.

712
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:53,627
- If you don't....
- I'll keep my trap shut. I will.

713
00:50:53,723 --> 00:50:55,680
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?

714
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:57,594
Bugs Dooley? No.

715
00:50:57,685 --> 00:51:01,220
He was a nice guy, just like you.
And he made a big mistake one day.

716
00:51:01,355 --> 00:51:02,897
Got a little too talkative.

717
00:51:02,982 --> 00:51:04,773
- You know what happened to his kid?
- No.

718
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:08,393
I can't tell you. But when Bugs heard
about it he blew his brains out.

719
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:10,273
That's terrible.

720
00:51:10,865 --> 00:51:13,949
He had it coming to him.
He talked too much. I never talk.

721
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,485
I never say a word. Word of honour.

722
00:51:16,704 --> 00:51:19,277
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.

723
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:21,698
Okay. Just remember that.

724
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,956
Now beat it.

725
00:51:24,128 --> 00:51:28,208
Sure, mister. Thanks.
I always knew you guys were--

726
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:31,170
Come on, scram.
And stay away from that bus.

727
00:51:31,302 --> 00:51:33,508
Sure. Anything you say.

728
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:36,924
- You wouldn't shoot me in the back?
- If you don't beat it....

729
00:51:37,016 --> 00:51:38,260
I'm going.

730
00:51:53,198 --> 00:51:55,321
What's wrong?
Why do we have to leave the bus?

731
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:57,318
Come on. Don't ask so many questions.

732
00:51:57,452 --> 00:51:58,995
Why?

733
00:52:05,586 --> 00:52:08,705
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have
frightened him like that.

734
00:52:08,797 --> 00:52:13,008
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

735
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,086
Why did we have to leave the bus?

736
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:19,881
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

737
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:23,891
I've been doing a little thinking myself.

738
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:27,600
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

739
00:52:27,691 --> 00:52:29,683
What's the matter, are you weakening?

740
00:52:29,776 --> 00:52:34,652
No. I was just thinking of you.
A starvation diet may not agree with you.

741
00:52:34,823 --> 00:52:37,029
Did you give that child all your money?

742
00:52:37,117 --> 00:52:39,786
I gave him nothing.
You were the big-hearted gal.

743
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:42,158
All the money I had was that ten spot.

744
00:52:42,288 --> 00:52:45,159
So I've been thinking
you better wire your father.

745
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:49,752
No, sir. I started out for New York
and I'm going to get there...

746
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,245
...if I have to starve all the way.

747
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:53,420
Okay.

748
00:52:54,426 --> 00:52:58,044
What is this strange power
this man Westley has over you women?

749
00:52:58,221 --> 00:52:59,680
Here, take these.

750
00:53:00,306 --> 00:53:03,094
- Hold on to them. Get up on that log.
- That?

751
00:53:03,184 --> 00:53:04,809
Get up on the log.

752
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:17,445
I wish you'd stop being playful.

753
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:22,568
So sorry. You know, this is the first time
in years I've ridden piggyback.

754
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:24,538
This isn't piggyback.

755
00:53:24,622 --> 00:53:26,780
- Of course it is.
- You're crazy.

756
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:31,326
I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

757
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,378
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.

758
00:53:33,464 --> 00:53:36,465
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

759
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:40,964
My uncle has four children.
I've seen them ride piggyback.

760
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:43,890
I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

761
00:53:43,975 --> 00:53:46,845
I never knew a rich man
who could piggyback ride.

762
00:53:47,937 --> 00:53:49,597
You're prejudiced.

763
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:53,276
Show me a good piggy backer.
I'll show you a real human.

764
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,562
Take Abraham Lincoln for instance.
A natural born piggy backer.

765
00:53:56,654 --> 00:54:00,189
Where do you get off with
that stuffed-shirt family of yours?

766
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:04,441
My father was a great piggy backer.

767
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:07,615
Here, hold this a minute.

768
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:12,877
Thank you.

769
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:21,341
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

770
00:54:35,276 --> 00:54:37,352
This looks like the best spot.

771
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,393
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?

772
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:44,107
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to give a good imitation of it.

773
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:45,322
Peter?

774
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:46,740
What?

775
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,162
I'm awfully hungry.

776
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:50,909
It's just your imagination.

777
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,500
No it isn't.

778
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:55,622
I'm hungry and scared.

779
00:54:55,963 --> 00:54:58,632
You can't be hungry
and scared both at the same time.

780
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:00,091
Well, I am.

781
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:02,547
If you're scared,
it scares the hunger out of you.

782
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:05,008
Not if you're more hungry than scared.

783
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:08,139
All right, you win. Let's forget about it.

784
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,052
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.

785
00:55:13,688 --> 00:55:17,472
Holy smoke!
Why did I ever get mixed up with you?

786
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,362
If I had any sense,
I'd be in New York by this time.

787
00:55:21,863 --> 00:55:23,571
What about your story?

788
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:26,408
Taking a married woman
back to her husband.

789
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,830
I turned out to be the prize sucker.

790
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:36,830
All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.

791
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:40,121
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

792
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:41,792
- Then take them off.
- What?

793
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:46,130
All right, don't take them off.
Do what you please, but shut up about it.

794
00:56:16,709 --> 00:56:19,496
You're becoming awfully
disagreeable lately.

795
00:56:19,796 --> 00:56:23,165
You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.

796
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:29,469
If being with me is so distasteful to you,
you can leave.

797
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:33,639
You can leave any time you see fit.

798
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:36,892
Nobody's holding you here.

799
00:56:38,272 --> 00:56:40,146
I can get along.

800
00:56:45,863 --> 00:56:47,144
Peter?

801
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,024
Peter!

802
00:56:59,835 --> 00:57:01,958
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!

803
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:05,830
What's got into you? I left for a minute
to find you something to eat.

804
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:07,087
I know but....

805
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:09,257
Here, eat your head off.

806
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:10,845
I don't want it now.

807
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,503
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but--

808
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:14,921
But what?

809
00:57:15,017 --> 00:57:17,590
I was so scared, it scared the hunger--

810
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:21,055
Holy jumping catfish.
You drive a guy crazy.

811
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:06,356
It's liable to get chilly before morning.

812
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:08,146
Better use this.

813
00:58:44,439 --> 00:58:45,981
What are you thinking about?

814
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,612
By a strange coincidence,
I was thinking of you.

815
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,939
- Really?
- Yeah.

816
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:58,658
I was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.

817
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:35,312
What did you say
we're supposed to be doing?

818
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:36,646
Hitchhiking.

819
00:59:39,035 --> 00:59:42,700
You've given me a very good example
of the hiking.

820
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:45,115
Where does the hitching come in?

821
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:47,699
It's a little early yet. No cars out.

822
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,038
If it's the same to you...

823
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:56,377
...I'm going to sit right here
and wait until they come.

824
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,605
You got a toothpick?

825
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:11,429
- What's the matter?
- I got hay in my teeth.

826
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:15,102
No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here, I got a penknife, though.

827
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:16,692
Now hold still.

828
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:19,318
- Be careful.
- All right. Where is it?

829
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:22,534
All right, now hold still.

830
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,828
Here. Get it?

831
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,785
Thanks.

832
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:31,827
You should have swallowed that.
You won't have any breakfast, you know?

833
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:33,664
You needn't rub it in.

834
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:40,299
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.

835
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:42,754
- Raw?
- Want one?

836
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:47,220
No. Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

837
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:51,474
That's right, I forgot. The idea
of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

838
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:54,935
You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

839
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,648
Have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

840
01:00:57,738 --> 01:00:59,814
I hate the horrid things.

841
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:05,485
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
Now we let a car get away.

842
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:08,028
And suppose nobody stops for us?

843
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:11,706
They'll stop all right. It's a matter
of knowing how to handle them.

844
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,453
And you're an expert I suppose.

845
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:17,419
Expert. And I'll write a book
about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail."

846
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,378
There's no end to your accomplishments,
is there?

847
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:22,504
- You think it's simple?
- No.

848
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:25,805
Well, it is simple.
It's all in that old thumb, see?

849
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,136
Some people do it like this. Or like this.

850
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,389
All wrong. Never get anywhere.

851
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:33,560
The poor things.

852
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:37,397
But that old thumb never fails.
It's all a matter of how you do it, though.

853
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,983
Now you take No. 1, for instance.

854
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:43,815
That's a short jerky movement, like this.
That shows independence.

855
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:46,578
You don't care if they stop or not.
You got money.

856
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,911
- Clever.
- No. 2, that's a little wider movement.

857
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,323
Smile goes with this one, like this.

858
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:57,080
That means you got a brand-new story
about the farmer's daughter.

859
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,790
You figured that out all by yourself?

860
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:04,585
That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip.
That's the pitiful one.

861
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,348
When you're broke and hungry,
everything looks black.

862
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:11,299
It's a long sweeping movement like this.
Gotta follow through, though.

863
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,930
That's amazing.

864
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,480
But it's no good,
if you haven't got a long face to go with it.

865
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,895
Here comes a car.

866
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,558
Okay. Now watch me.
I'm gonna use No. 1.

867
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,858
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby,
and see what happens.

868
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,696
I still got my eye on the thumb.

869
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,828
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try No. 2.

870
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,212
When you get to 100, wake me up.

871
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,796
I don't think I'll write that book after all.

872
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,373
Think of all the fun you had, though.

873
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:27,967
You mind if I try?

874
01:03:28,762 --> 01:03:29,794
You?

875
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,888
Don't make me laugh.

876
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:37,886
You're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.

877
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,351
I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.

878
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:43,478
What are you gonna do?

879
01:03:43,902 --> 01:03:45,812
It's a system all my own.

880
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:09,130
Aren't you going to give me a little credit?

881
01:04:09,344 --> 01:04:10,673
What for?

882
01:04:12,055 --> 01:04:15,839
I proved once and for all that
the limb is mightier than the thumb.

883
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:20,053
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

884
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:22,602
I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.

885
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:26,976
So, you're just married?
That's pretty good.

886
01:04:27,195 --> 01:04:32,403
But if I was young, that's the way
I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.

887
01:04:32,659 --> 01:04:36,953
Yes, sir. "Hitchhiking down the highway

888
01:04:37,038 --> 01:04:41,036
"Of love on a honeymoon

889
01:04:41,209 --> 01:04:44,044
"Hitchhiking down the highway, down"

890
01:04:55,974 --> 01:04:58,299
Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

891
01:04:58,435 --> 01:05:00,511
Tonsil? Me? No.

892
01:05:01,479 --> 01:05:06,106
Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn"

893
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:09,774
All right, let it go.

894
01:05:09,988 --> 01:05:11,233
"Turn"

895
01:05:20,832 --> 01:05:22,112
How about a bite to eat?

896
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,823
- That would be lovely.
- No thanks, we're not hungry.

897
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:27,078
Young people in love are never hungry.

898
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:28,002
No.

899
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:30,876
"Young people in love

900
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:34,917
"Are very seldom hungry

901
01:05:35,305 --> 01:05:40,512
"People in love are very seldom hungry"

902
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:44,561
What were you going to do?
Gold dig that guy for a meal?

903
01:05:45,314 --> 01:05:47,936
Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.

904
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:49,853
Eat a carrot.

905
01:05:50,611 --> 01:05:51,643
No.

906
01:05:52,864 --> 01:05:54,358
I'm going in to ask him.

907
01:05:54,448 --> 01:05:56,525
You do and I'll break your neck.

908
01:06:08,588 --> 01:06:11,292
Come on, let's get out of here.
Stretch our legs.

909
01:06:37,741 --> 01:06:39,070
I'm sorry....

910
01:06:39,493 --> 01:06:41,071
That's all right.

911
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:55,087
Hey! Come here!

912
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:58,376
You've got my suitcase!

913
01:07:20,784 --> 01:07:22,492
What happened to you? I was worried.

914
01:07:22,578 --> 01:07:24,866
- Get in.
- Look at your face! You've got a cut!

915
01:07:25,247 --> 01:07:26,871
Well, what happened?

916
01:07:26,957 --> 01:07:30,622
A road thief. Picks people up,
runs off with their things. What a racket.

917
01:07:30,711 --> 01:07:32,121
How'd you get the car?

918
01:07:32,212 --> 01:07:35,379
I gave him a black eye for it
and had to tie him up to a tree.

919
01:08:07,247 --> 01:08:09,572
Can't be much gas left in this thing.

920
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:12,159
Gotta start promoting some.

921
01:08:14,087 --> 01:08:17,004
Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.

922
01:08:17,757 --> 01:08:19,880
That'll be good for ten gallons.

923
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:58,497
I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.

924
01:08:58,589 --> 01:09:01,259
I don't like you. Never have. Never will.

925
01:09:01,467 --> 01:09:03,259
Now that's clear enough, isn't it?

926
01:09:03,344 --> 01:09:06,013
You've made it evident
by your threats of annulment.

927
01:09:06,097 --> 01:09:07,924
It hasn't worried me for a minute.

928
01:09:08,057 --> 01:09:10,548
Ellie and I got married
because we love each other.

929
01:09:10,685 --> 01:09:14,517
She's proving it. As far as I'm concerned,
there's going to be no annulment.

930
01:09:14,605 --> 01:09:19,812
I see. You've got hold of a good thing
and you're going to hang on to it?

931
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:25,398
All right, you win.
I'll just have to get used to you.

932
01:09:25,825 --> 01:09:29,657
I admit, I'm licked.
But it's only because I'm worried.

933
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:34,162
If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.

934
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:38,164
I could have helped if it hadn't been
for you. I've been watched so closely--

935
01:09:38,254 --> 01:09:43,461
I know. Well, you can help now.
I've got a room full of reporters in there.

936
01:09:44,009 --> 01:09:46,132
Now, I want you to make a statement.

937
01:09:46,303 --> 01:09:50,135
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding.

938
01:09:50,224 --> 01:09:53,889
And that if she returns
I won't interfere with your marriage.

939
01:10:04,822 --> 01:10:07,277
- All right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.

940
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:08,480
Okay.

941
01:10:08,742 --> 01:10:11,412
I hope you and your wife
spend a pleasant week with us.

942
01:10:11,495 --> 01:10:13,986
So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.

943
01:10:14,081 --> 01:10:15,456
Goodnight.

944
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:19,660
- All right, brat.
- Any luck?

945
01:10:19,753 --> 01:10:22,505
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us
have a cabin.

946
01:10:22,673 --> 01:10:23,953
What about the money?

947
01:10:24,049 --> 01:10:27,299
I talked him out of that idea.
He thinks we're staying a week.

948
01:10:27,386 --> 01:10:30,137
- I must think something up before morning.
- That's swell.

949
01:10:30,222 --> 01:10:35,014
Yeah? I'm glad you think so.
If you ask me, I think it's foolish.

950
01:10:35,644 --> 01:10:40,270
I told you there's no use in staying here.
We can make New York in three hours.

951
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:46,892
I thought you were in a hurry to get back.

952
01:10:51,952 --> 01:10:55,451
Whoever heard of getting in
at 3:00 in the morning?

953
01:10:56,039 --> 01:10:58,198
Everybody will be asleep.

954
01:11:03,713 --> 01:11:06,500
Okay. Cottage no. 6.

955
01:11:32,617 --> 01:11:36,946
There you go, trusting people again.
How many times did I tell you--

956
01:11:37,038 --> 01:11:40,489
But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.

957
01:11:47,006 --> 01:11:48,666
We're on the last lap.

958
01:11:53,388 --> 01:11:56,057
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be in the arms of your husband.

959
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,338
Yeah.

960
01:11:59,686 --> 01:12:01,477
You'll have a great story, won't you?

961
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:04,429
Yeah. Swell.

962
01:12:26,921 --> 01:12:28,166
Thanks.

963
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:05,656
We certainly outsmarted your father.

964
01:13:07,336 --> 01:13:09,245
I guess you ought to be happy.

965
01:13:10,089 --> 01:13:12,295
Am I going to see you in New York?

966
01:13:14,718 --> 01:13:15,881
Nope.

967
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,460
Why not?

968
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:24,183
I don't make it a policy
to run around with married women.

969
01:13:25,938 --> 01:13:28,476
There's no harm in your coming to see us.

970
01:13:30,025 --> 01:13:31,484
Not interested.

971
01:13:35,447 --> 01:13:37,155
Won't I ever see you again?

972
01:13:38,116 --> 01:13:40,192
What for? I've served my purpose!

973
01:13:40,327 --> 01:13:44,027
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

974
01:14:20,325 --> 01:14:22,483
Have you ever been in love, Peter?

975
01:14:24,162 --> 01:14:25,241
Me?

976
01:14:26,748 --> 01:14:27,661
Yes.

977
01:14:29,668 --> 01:14:32,205
Haven't you ever thought about it at all?

978
01:14:34,881 --> 01:14:38,546
It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

979
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:43,512
Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?

980
01:14:47,518 --> 01:14:50,092
If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.

981
01:14:51,773 --> 01:14:53,267
Where are you gonna find her?

982
01:14:53,358 --> 01:14:55,765
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

983
01:14:55,902 --> 01:14:58,025
They don't come that way anymore.

984
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,943
Have I ever thought about it?

985
01:15:06,621 --> 01:15:09,740
I've even been sucker
enough to make plans.

986
01:15:15,421 --> 01:15:20,213
I saw an island in the Pacific once.
Never been able to forget it.

987
01:15:23,804 --> 01:15:25,464
That's where I'd like to take her.

988
01:15:27,767 --> 01:15:30,139
She'd have to be the sort of a girl...

989
01:15:30,353 --> 01:15:33,935
...who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.

990
01:15:40,029 --> 01:15:44,987
Nights when you,
the moon and the water all become one.

991
01:15:46,076 --> 01:15:49,362
You feel you're part
of something big and marvellous.

992
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,282
That's the only place to live.

993
01:15:55,419 --> 01:16:00,247
The stars are so close overhead you feel
you could reach up and stir them around.

994
01:16:06,138 --> 01:16:08,131
I've been thinking about it.

995
01:16:09,767 --> 01:16:13,301
Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those things.

996
01:16:21,195 --> 01:16:23,768
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

997
01:16:23,864 --> 01:16:26,616
I want to do all those things
you talked about.

998
01:16:27,993 --> 01:16:30,152
You better go back to your bed.

999
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:34,490
I love you. Nothing else matters.
But we can run away.

1000
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:38,331
Everything will take care of itself.
Please, Peter...

1001
01:16:39,046 --> 01:16:41,715
...I can't let you out of my life now.

1002
01:16:42,841 --> 01:16:45,379
I couldn't live without you.

1003
01:16:59,066 --> 01:17:01,224
You'd better go back to your bed.

1004
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:12,029
I'm sorry.

1005
01:17:50,909 --> 01:17:53,613
Did you mean that? Would you really go?

1006
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:36,779
All I'm asking is enough gas
to get me to New York.

1007
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:38,455
That bag's worth $25.

1008
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:41,372
I got a bag. I got one for Christmas--

1009
01:18:41,459 --> 01:18:44,032
Here's what I'll do.
I'll come back in the morning...

1010
01:18:44,128 --> 01:18:46,286
...and buy it back from you
with a $10 profit.

1011
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:48,669
- What do you say?
- I ain't got a hat.

1012
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:50,965
- What?
- I ain't got a hat.

1013
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:54,180
Well, you got one now.
Come on, fill her up.

1014
01:19:01,645 --> 01:19:05,228
Where you been all this time?
Everybody's been asking about you.

1015
01:19:05,316 --> 01:19:09,100
Get me one drink.
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.

1016
01:19:09,194 --> 01:19:10,392
Sure, boss.

1017
01:19:13,157 --> 01:19:14,271
Hello, Agnes.

1018
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:17,782
- Don't. He'll shoot you on sight.
- Haven't been shot at in days.

1019
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:20,787
- Get out of here! Get out!
- Now listen, Joe.

1020
01:19:20,873 --> 01:19:21,868
Don't "Joe" me.

1021
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:23,416
All right, Joe. Listen.

1022
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,959
You know I've always liked you.

1023
01:19:25,044 --> 01:19:27,582
Anytime I could help you,
ran across a good story...

1024
01:19:27,671 --> 01:19:30,672
...I came running to you with it.
I got one now.

1025
01:19:30,924 --> 01:19:33,332
The wires were on the level.
The biggest scoop ever.

1026
01:19:33,427 --> 01:19:35,170
- It's yours.
- About the Andrews kid?

1027
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:38,720
I've got it all written up, ready to go.
All I want is a $1,000.

1028
01:19:38,849 --> 01:19:40,509
A $1,000? Get out of here before--

1029
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:42,677
Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.

1030
01:19:42,769 --> 01:19:45,307
I need a $1,000 and I need it quick.
I'm in a jam.

1031
01:19:45,397 --> 01:19:47,057
What's the $1,000 for?

1032
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,773
To tear down the walls of Jericho.

1033
01:19:48,859 --> 01:19:50,650
Never mind. If I told you that...

1034
01:19:50,736 --> 01:19:52,812
...Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?

1035
01:19:52,904 --> 01:19:54,897
- She'll marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.

1036
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,899
Would such a story
be worth $1,000 to you?

1037
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:59,827
- If it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.

1038
01:20:02,038 --> 01:20:05,158
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am.

1039
01:20:06,752 --> 01:20:08,495
- You?
- Yes.

1040
01:20:08,587 --> 01:20:11,837
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home.
Don't annoy me anymore.

1041
01:20:11,923 --> 01:20:14,461
For heaven sakes!
Stop being an editor for a minute.

1042
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:17,256
We know each other.
You ought to know when I'm serious.

1043
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:20,050
This is on the level.
I met her on a bus from Miami.

1044
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,761
I've been with her every minute.
I'm in love with her.

1045
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:25,472
You gotta get me this money now, quick.
Minutes count.

1046
01:20:25,562 --> 01:20:27,685
She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.

1047
01:20:27,772 --> 01:20:30,809
I gotta get right back.
She doesn't even know I'm gone.

1048
01:20:30,942 --> 01:20:34,311
A guy can't propose to a gal
without a cent in the world, can he?

1049
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:38,776
What a story. On her way
to join husband, Ellen Andrews--

1050
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,361
That's it.

1051
01:20:42,245 --> 01:20:43,988
Let me see that a minute.

1052
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:47,781
Zeke!

1053
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:54,380
I told you, you couldn't trust him.
He's gone.

1054
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,414
Who?

1055
01:20:55,592 --> 01:20:59,340
The fella who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car with him, too.

1056
01:20:59,429 --> 01:21:02,714
We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia.

1057
01:21:02,807 --> 01:21:05,594
Get up, don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

1058
01:21:05,685 --> 01:21:08,935
There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.

1059
01:21:23,036 --> 01:21:24,613
See that? They're gone.

1060
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:27,912
Looks like it, don't it? What's this?

1061
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:31,491
Ma! Here's the woman.

1062
01:21:32,003 --> 01:21:34,375
- What's the matter?
- Where's your husband?

1063
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,550
- Husband?
- Yes, if he is your husband.

1064
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:42,677
- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.

1065
01:21:44,724 --> 01:21:46,467
You got any money?

1066
01:21:47,101 --> 01:21:48,809
- No.
- Then you'll have to git!

1067
01:21:48,894 --> 01:21:50,686
Yeah. You'll have to git.

1068
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:56,360
Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.

1069
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:58,520
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.

1070
01:21:58,612 --> 01:22:02,990
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.

1071
01:22:04,702 --> 01:22:09,245
And listen, next time you better not come
back here. I run a respectable place.

1072
01:22:13,252 --> 01:22:16,419
- Thanks, you saved my life.
- Okay. So long kid and good luck.

1073
01:22:16,505 --> 01:22:20,585
Goodbye. You're beautiful.
All women are beautiful.

1074
01:22:20,968 --> 01:22:24,218
For my dough, he's still the best
newspaper man in the business.

1075
01:22:24,346 --> 01:22:26,968
Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn.

1076
01:22:27,599 --> 01:22:28,880
Hold up the morning edition.

1077
01:22:28,976 --> 01:22:31,645
Break down the front page.
We'll have a new layout.

1078
01:22:31,728 --> 01:22:35,512
Send in a couple of rewrite men.
And Hank, listen. Don't do a thing.

1079
01:22:35,607 --> 01:22:39,854
I've got a story that'll make your hair curl.
Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, I'm busy.

1080
01:22:39,945 --> 01:22:44,358
Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up
all the pictures on that Andrews kid.

1081
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:49,028
And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.
I want a cartoon and I want it quick.

1082
01:22:49,663 --> 01:22:51,786
Westley's in it.
He's waiting at the church...

1083
01:22:51,874 --> 01:22:54,828
...with tears on his face.
The bride didn't show up.

1084
01:22:55,002 --> 01:22:57,124
Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.

1085
01:22:57,212 --> 01:23:00,913
Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it. What is it?

1086
01:23:03,468 --> 01:23:05,627
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.

1087
01:23:05,804 --> 01:23:09,504
I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp asking him to come.

1088
01:23:09,599 --> 01:23:12,636
He's getting a police escort
and Westley's going along.

1089
01:23:12,728 --> 01:23:15,183
Yes, she's been travelling by bus.

1090
01:23:15,272 --> 01:23:18,273
When she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

1091
01:23:18,358 --> 01:23:22,107
Okay, grab a car and stay with them.
Get Hank again.

1092
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:25,315
Agnes, get me a doctor,
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.

1093
01:23:25,407 --> 01:23:27,898
Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare.

1094
01:23:27,993 --> 01:23:31,658
Agnes, you call the police department.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

1095
01:23:31,746 --> 01:23:34,534
Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched.

1096
01:23:34,624 --> 01:23:35,454
You want us?

1097
01:23:35,542 --> 01:23:38,708
Change the front page!
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.

1098
01:23:38,795 --> 01:23:41,749
She's going home. She found
out Dad withdrew his objections.

1099
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,413
She gave herself up.
Spread it all over the place!

1100
01:23:44,509 --> 01:23:48,293
Play it up big! Major league!
"Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it.

1101
01:23:48,471 --> 01:23:49,467
Okay.

1102
01:24:05,822 --> 01:24:08,574
Come on, baby.
We gotta get there before she wakes up.

1103
01:24:19,419 --> 01:24:21,707
Can't you drive any faster?

1104
01:24:24,632 --> 01:24:30,670
"Young people in love are never hungry"

1105
01:24:39,939 --> 01:24:42,940
Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.

1106
01:24:53,703 --> 01:24:57,036
Come on, baby.
They can't make a sucker out of us.

1107
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,080
All right, come on.
Step back. Give them room.

1108
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:05,963
Come on, step back.

1109
01:25:08,092 --> 01:25:10,250
How about a picture for the paper,
Mr. Andrews?

1110
01:25:10,344 --> 01:25:13,345
Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.

1111
01:25:22,272 --> 01:25:27,480
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

1112
01:25:27,611 --> 01:25:31,940
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze"

1113
01:25:45,629 --> 01:25:47,289
Get that thing out of the way!

1114
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:51,295
Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.

1115
01:26:13,865 --> 01:26:15,657
Hey, you darn fool!

1116
01:27:21,516 --> 01:27:25,264
Ellen Andrews is going to marry
that Westley guy again.

1117
01:27:34,529 --> 01:27:36,153
Gordon's out back some place.

1118
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:40,064
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.

1119
01:27:43,663 --> 01:27:46,580
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter was just in.

1120
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:48,076
- What?
- He left this money.

1121
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:50,456
- He said he was just kidding.
- Where is he?

1122
01:27:50,544 --> 01:27:52,537
- There he goes.
- Hey, Pete!

1123
01:27:55,758 --> 01:28:00,550
Hello. I'm sorry, it was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.

1124
01:28:00,638 --> 01:28:03,508
Yeah, sure you had me going
for a little while, too.

1125
01:28:03,599 --> 01:28:06,553
- It wouldn't have made a bad story at that.
- No, great.

1126
01:28:06,644 --> 01:28:09,929
But that's the way things go.
You think you've got a great yarn...

1127
01:28:10,022 --> 01:28:14,814
...and then something comes along and
messes up the finish. And there you are.

1128
01:28:15,611 --> 01:28:18,232
Yeah. Where am I?

1129
01:28:23,786 --> 01:28:26,703
When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.

1130
01:28:27,915 --> 01:28:28,946
Thanks.

1131
01:28:54,233 --> 01:28:55,431
Ellie?

1132
01:28:55,984 --> 01:28:57,313
Hello, Dad.

1133
01:28:57,402 --> 01:28:59,062
I knocked several times.

1134
01:29:00,072 --> 01:29:02,741
I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.

1135
01:29:02,824 --> 01:29:06,904
Everything's set.
Creating quite a furore, too.

1136
01:29:07,538 --> 01:29:09,696
Great stunt King is going to pull.

1137
01:29:10,457 --> 01:29:11,287
Stunt?

1138
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:13,581
Yeah, he's landing on the lawn
in an autogyro.

1139
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:18,506
Yes, I heard.

1140
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:20,583
Personally, I think it's silly, too.

1141
01:29:21,843 --> 01:29:23,717
You look lovely, child.

1142
01:29:23,804 --> 01:29:25,796
Are you pleased with the gown?

1143
01:29:27,098 --> 01:29:28,094
Ellie?

1144
01:29:30,602 --> 01:29:33,437
The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

1145
01:29:39,653 --> 01:29:41,361
What's the matter, child?

1146
01:29:44,491 --> 01:29:45,819
What's wrong?

1147
01:29:45,909 --> 01:29:47,107
Nothing.

1148
01:29:47,786 --> 01:29:50,359
You haven't changed your mind
about King have you?

1149
01:29:50,497 --> 01:29:51,576
No.

1150
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:56,119
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.

1151
01:29:56,294 --> 01:29:59,580
Well, you gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.

1152
01:29:59,756 --> 01:30:02,591
You know,
the old pump isn't what it used to be.

1153
01:30:03,134 --> 01:30:07,677
I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world. You know that.

1154
01:30:07,847 --> 01:30:09,591
What's the matter, child?

1155
01:30:10,892 --> 01:30:12,303
Aren't you happy?

1156
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,223
I thought so.

1157
01:30:17,732 --> 01:30:20,519
I knew there was something on your mind.

1158
01:30:22,528 --> 01:30:24,320
There, now.

1159
01:30:26,532 --> 01:30:28,110
What's the matter?

1160
01:30:29,786 --> 01:30:32,952
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

1161
01:30:34,874 --> 01:30:36,202
Have you?

1162
01:30:39,754 --> 01:30:42,624
I haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.

1163
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,922
This must be serious.

1164
01:30:47,261 --> 01:30:48,886
Where'd you meet him?

1165
01:30:50,932 --> 01:30:52,390
On the road.

1166
01:30:52,642 --> 01:30:55,559
Now don't tell me you've fallen in love
with a bus driver?

1167
01:30:55,686 --> 01:30:56,967
Oh, no.

1168
01:31:01,692 --> 01:31:02,890
Who is he?

1169
01:31:04,278 --> 01:31:06,520
I don't know very much about him.

1170
01:31:07,448 --> 01:31:09,405
Except that I love him.

1171
01:31:09,658 --> 01:31:12,909
If it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth to--

1172
01:31:13,037 --> 01:31:16,406
No, it's no use. He despises me.

1173
01:31:16,874 --> 01:31:17,739
Come now.

1174
01:31:17,833 --> 01:31:20,918
Yes, he does.
He despises everything about me.

1175
01:31:21,086 --> 01:31:27,089
He says that I'm spoiled and selfish
and pampered and thoroughly insincere.

1176
01:31:27,468 --> 01:31:28,879
Ridiculous.

1177
01:31:29,345 --> 01:31:31,836
He doesn't think so much of you, either.

1178
01:31:31,972 --> 01:31:32,968
Well, I--

1179
01:31:33,057 --> 01:31:35,974
And he blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

1180
01:31:36,226 --> 01:31:38,800
He says you raised me stupidly.

1181
01:31:39,313 --> 01:31:42,230
And now that's a fine man
to fall in love with.

1182
01:31:42,775 --> 01:31:44,435
He's marvellous.

1183
01:31:44,693 --> 01:31:47,860
What are we going to do about it?
Where is he?

1184
01:31:48,989 --> 01:31:51,907
- I don't know.
- I'd like to have a talk with him.

1185
01:31:52,076 --> 01:31:56,204
It wouldn't do any good.
I practically threw myself at him.

1186
01:31:56,955 --> 01:32:00,823
Under the circumstances, don't you think
we'd better call this thing off?

1187
01:32:02,211 --> 01:32:03,788
No, I'll go through with it.

1188
01:32:03,879 --> 01:32:06,833
But that's silly.
Seeing the way you feel about him.

1189
01:32:07,007 --> 01:32:10,174
No, it doesn't matter.
I don't want to stir up any more trouble.

1190
01:32:10,302 --> 01:32:12,544
I've done it all my life.

1191
01:32:12,638 --> 01:32:16,137
I've made your life miserable.
And mine, too.

1192
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:22,308
I'm tired, father. I'm tired
of running around in circles.

1193
01:32:23,315 --> 01:32:26,814
He's right, that's what I've been doing
ever since I can remember.

1194
01:32:27,652 --> 01:32:29,396
I've got to settle down.

1195
01:32:30,405 --> 01:32:33,490
It doesn't matter how,
where, or with whom.

1196
01:32:35,118 --> 01:32:37,870
You've changed, Ellie.

1197
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:43,206
I can't walk out on King now.
It would make us all look so ridiculous.

1198
01:32:44,044 --> 01:32:47,413
Anyway, what difference does it make?

1199
01:32:48,548 --> 01:32:50,588
I'll never see Peter again.

1200
01:32:50,842 --> 01:32:52,550
Is that his name?

1201
01:32:54,429 --> 01:32:55,888
Peter Warne.

1202
01:32:57,098 --> 01:32:58,806
Peter Warne.

1203
01:33:01,686 --> 01:33:03,145
Why, do you know him?

1204
01:33:03,271 --> 01:33:04,896
Why, no.

1205
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:07,763
Father, you haven't heard from him,
have you?

1206
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:11,020
- Don't be silly, of course.
- Please, what's that?

1207
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:27,825
I guess that was his only interest in me,
wasn't it?

1208
01:33:27,962 --> 01:33:31,046
- The reward.
- I'm sorry you read it.

1209
01:33:31,132 --> 01:33:34,133
- Are you going to see him?
- I suppose so.

1210
01:33:35,303 --> 01:33:39,253
Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

1211
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:43,887
He kept me thoroughly entertained.
It's worth every penny he gets.

1212
01:33:44,228 --> 01:33:46,933
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.

1213
01:33:47,064 --> 01:33:49,187
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

1214
01:33:49,317 --> 01:33:51,060
Fine, have him come in.

1215
01:33:57,825 --> 01:33:59,367
I'll be going.

1216
01:34:10,671 --> 01:34:14,040
If it isn't the bridegroom himself.
You're just in time, King.

1217
01:34:14,133 --> 01:34:15,544
How are you, Ellie?

1218
01:34:16,385 --> 01:34:17,299
You happy?

1219
01:34:17,386 --> 01:34:19,924
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?

1220
01:34:20,306 --> 01:34:22,382
Here we are, let's drink.

1221
01:34:22,475 --> 01:34:25,808
It's up to you now.
I want our life to be full of excitement.

1222
01:34:25,895 --> 01:34:29,180
We'll never let up, will we?
Never a dull moment.

1223
01:34:29,315 --> 01:34:31,806
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

1224
01:34:32,401 --> 01:34:36,695
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.

1225
01:34:53,213 --> 01:34:55,502
Yeah. Who?

1226
01:34:58,218 --> 01:34:59,796
Why can't I see you at your office?

1227
01:35:00,095 --> 01:35:03,511
I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.

1228
01:35:03,599 --> 01:35:06,765
I thought, perhaps,
you'd like to get this thing settled.

1229
01:35:06,935 --> 01:35:10,435
Yeah. But I don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.

1230
01:35:10,522 --> 01:35:13,192
Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.

1231
01:35:13,275 --> 01:35:16,560
You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.

1232
01:35:16,695 --> 01:35:19,186
No. Why do I wanna--

1233
01:35:22,367 --> 01:35:26,696
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I will come over. Yeah.

1234
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:30,200
I'd like to get a load of
that three ring circus you're pulling.

1235
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:32,913
I wanna see what love looks like
when it's triumphant.

1236
01:35:33,003 --> 01:35:35,245
I haven't had a good laugh in a week.

1237
01:35:38,175 --> 01:35:38,874
Mr. Warne?

1238
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:40,130
Yeah.

1239
01:35:42,929 --> 01:35:45,254
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1240
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:49,555
I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me anything...

1241
01:35:49,644 --> 01:35:51,637
...about you. About your helping her.

1242
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:54,849
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

1243
01:35:54,983 --> 01:35:57,474
Why did she think
I lugged her from Miami?

1244
01:35:57,694 --> 01:36:00,363
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

1245
01:36:00,447 --> 01:36:04,694
She does? Isn't that sweet of her?
You don't, I suppose.

1246
01:36:04,826 --> 01:36:09,287
Well, I don't know. I'll have to see
on what you base your claim.

1247
01:36:09,372 --> 01:36:11,246
I presume you feel justified.

1248
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:14,784
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemised.

1249
01:36:17,464 --> 01:36:22,458
"Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.

1250
01:36:22,552 --> 01:36:25,304
"Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.

1251
01:36:25,388 --> 01:36:31,224
"Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.

1252
01:36:31,728 --> 01:36:34,812
"All of the above items had
to be sold to buy gasoline."

1253
01:36:34,981 --> 01:36:37,982
And I sold some shorts and socks, too.
I'm throwing those in.

1254
01:36:38,109 --> 01:36:41,394
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?

1255
01:36:41,696 --> 01:36:44,317
Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000,
maybe more.

1256
01:36:44,407 --> 01:36:49,614
Now, let me get this straight. You want
$39.60 in addition to the $10,000?

1257
01:36:50,038 --> 01:36:51,615
What 10,000?

1258
01:36:52,081 --> 01:36:53,492
The reward.

1259
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,658
Who said anything about a reward?

1260
01:36:56,836 --> 01:36:59,588
I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused.
I assumed--

1261
01:36:59,672 --> 01:37:04,168
All I want is $39.60. If you give
me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.

1262
01:37:04,343 --> 01:37:06,051
It gives me the jitters.

1263
01:37:06,888 --> 01:37:10,054
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.

1264
01:37:10,141 --> 01:37:12,892
The average man would go
after the reward.

1265
01:37:12,977 --> 01:37:15,349
Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?

1266
01:37:15,438 --> 01:37:18,474
It's a matter of principle.
You probably wouldn't understand.

1267
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:22,433
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
I don't like paying for the privilege.

1268
01:37:22,528 --> 01:37:24,437
Were you taken for a buggy ride?

1269
01:37:24,613 --> 01:37:28,445
Yes. With all the trimmings.
So how about the check, do I get it?

1270
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:30,992
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

1271
01:37:45,509 --> 01:37:47,003
Here you are.

1272
01:37:47,344 --> 01:37:48,542
Thank you.

1273
01:37:49,888 --> 01:37:52,973
Do you mind if I ask you a question,
frankly?

1274
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:55,307
Do you love my daughter?

1275
01:37:56,687 --> 01:37:59,688
Any guy in love with your daughter
should be examined.

1276
01:37:59,773 --> 01:38:01,149
Now that's an evasion.

1277
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:05,438
She picked herself a perfect running mate,
King Westley. The pill of the century.

1278
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:09,647
She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.

1279
01:38:09,742 --> 01:38:12,778
If you were wiser,
you'd have done it yourself long ago.

1280
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:14,068
Do you love her?

1281
01:38:14,162 --> 01:38:17,247
A normal man couldn't live
with her without going nutty.

1282
01:38:17,332 --> 01:38:18,708
She's my idea of nothing.

1283
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:21,117
I asked you a simple question!
Do you love her?

1284
01:38:21,211 --> 01:38:25,375
Yes! Now don't hold that against me!
I'm a little screwy myself!

1285
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:30,505
Here's to the merry-go-round.

1286
01:38:36,852 --> 01:38:39,425
Perfect. Now you look natural.

1287
01:38:44,901 --> 01:38:47,606
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.

1288
01:38:47,737 --> 01:38:50,228
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.

1289
01:38:50,907 --> 01:38:53,908
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

1290
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:56,366
I would, but I've got a weak stomach.

1291
01:39:02,752 --> 01:39:05,540
- I just had a long talk with him.
- I'm not interested.

1292
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:06,959
Now just a minute, Ellie.

1293
01:39:07,048 --> 01:39:09,670
I don't want to hear
another word about him.

1294
01:39:22,438 --> 01:39:25,190
Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.

1295
01:40:19,245 --> 01:40:21,534
Here they come, boys. Turn them over.

1296
01:40:50,192 --> 01:40:52,398
You're a sucker to go through with this.

1297
01:40:53,821 --> 01:40:55,897
That guy, Warne, is okay.

1298
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:00,534
He didn't want the reward.
All he asked for was $39.60.

1299
01:41:00,619 --> 01:41:04,070
It's what he spent on you.
Said it was a matter of principle.

1300
01:41:04,164 --> 01:41:06,122
You took him for a ride.

1301
01:41:13,382 --> 01:41:16,383
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.

1302
01:41:18,929 --> 01:41:21,930
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

1303
01:41:22,266 --> 01:41:24,638
I can buy him off for a pot of gold.

1304
01:41:28,564 --> 01:41:30,971
And you can make an old man happy.

1305
01:41:31,066 --> 01:41:33,735
And you won't do so bad for yourself.

1306
01:41:34,152 --> 01:41:37,272
If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

1307
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:51,875
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

1308
01:41:51,962 --> 01:41:55,746
...and in the face of this company,
to join together this man and this woman...

1309
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,253
...in holy matrimony. If any man can show
just cause why they may not lawfully...

1310
01:42:00,345 --> 01:42:05,552
...be joined together, let him now speak
or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.

1311
01:42:08,353 --> 01:42:13,229
King, will thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife so long as you both shall live?

1312
01:42:13,733 --> 01:42:14,729
I will.

1313
01:42:15,944 --> 01:42:19,526
Ellen, will thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

1314
01:42:19,614 --> 01:42:21,903
...so long as you both shall live?

1315
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:26,651
Ellen!

1316
01:42:28,206 --> 01:42:29,404
Ellie!

1317
01:42:59,612 --> 01:43:00,727
What happened?

1318
01:43:00,863 --> 01:43:02,939
I haven't the slightest idea.

1319
01:43:17,713 --> 01:43:21,841
Don't want to talk to you.
Don't want to talk to anybody.

1320
01:43:21,926 --> 01:43:23,503
Don't want to see anybody.

1321
01:43:23,594 --> 01:43:25,421
But it's King Westley on the phone.

1322
01:43:28,849 --> 01:43:35,101
Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.
I've sent you a check for $100,000.

1323
01:43:35,606 --> 01:43:40,185
That's the smartest thing you ever did,
Westley, not to contest that annulment.

1324
01:43:40,569 --> 01:43:44,188
That's satisfactory, isn't it? It ought to be.

1325
01:43:44,448 --> 01:43:48,777
I'm not complaining.
Not complaining. It was dirt-cheap.

1326
01:43:49,912 --> 01:43:52,237
Don't fall out of any windows!

1327
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:56,869
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

1328
01:43:57,419 --> 01:44:01,038
"What's holding up the annulment,
you slowpoke.

1329
01:44:01,382 --> 01:44:04,501
"The walls of Jericho are toppling."

1330
01:44:06,095 --> 01:44:10,721
Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, "Let them topple."

1331
01:44:13,852 --> 01:44:15,892
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.

1332
01:44:16,063 --> 01:44:18,352
If you ask me,
I don't believe they're married.

1333
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,931
They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.

1334
01:44:21,443 --> 01:44:25,061
They made me get them a rope
and a blanket, on a night like this.

1335
01:44:25,197 --> 01:44:26,572
What do you reckon that's for?

1336
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:29,232
Blamed if I know.
I just brought them a trumpet.

1337
01:44:29,326 --> 01:44:30,405
A trumpet?

1338
01:44:30,494 --> 01:44:32,949
A toy. They sent me to the store to get it.

1339
01:44:33,038 --> 01:44:35,410
What in the world do they want
a trumpet for?

1340
01:44:35,499 --> 01:44:36,661
Don't know.
