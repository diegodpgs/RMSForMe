Hello, Mama.

1222
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,313
Did you know to be eligible
for a Division l scholarship. . .

1223
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:38,609
-. . .Michael will need to make a 2.5 GPA?
-Really?

1224
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:43,281
His ACT is low and l don't see it getting
any better if he retakes it. Right there.

1225
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:44,740
Well, what's his GPA now?

1226
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:47,451
1 .76.

1227
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,871
That's not bad when you
consider where he started.

1228
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,415
Well, he's gonna have to
make all A's this year.

1229
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:56,502
I'm serious.
And that might not even be enough.

1230
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,296
So he goes to a junior college.

1231
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,883
Unh-uhn. Most inner-city kids that
go to JC drop out in the first year.

1232
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,302
And his shot at the pros
would go out the window.

1233
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,555
Pros? Are we even sure
he's gonna get college offers?

There's 20 more of them on there.
And these things right here, 50 of them.

-Any of those from Ole Miss?
-No.

1241

They're not gonna start recruiting
till they hire another coach.

1242
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:38,252
Doesn't make any difference
unless Michael makes his grades. Ahem.

1246
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:55,102
I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy,
but I have certain, shall we say, doubts.

1247

Well, l appreciate your honesty,
Miss Sue.

-He needs to do better in school.
-Obviously.

1250
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,236
But why the big push?

1251
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:08,491
Well, he's in line for a football
scholarship if he gets his grades up.

1252
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:11,827
-ls he considering Ole Miss?
-Better be.

1253
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:14,789
I'd love to work with him.

1254
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:17,375
Well, when would you like to start?

1255
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:22,088
Mrs. Tuohy, um, there's something
you should know about me.

1256
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,965
I don't usually tell many people...

1257
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:27,802
. ..but it's something l feel you should
be aware of before you hire me.

1258

Uh-- What is it?

Okay.

1261

-l don't understand it.
-Yet.

1262
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:47,113
You don't understand it yet.

1263
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,408
How big is your head, Michael?

1264

-A brain.

It's full of knowledge.

1268
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:01,752
Like a file cabinet with maps,
and shortcuts for figuring things out.

1269

You'll get there, Michael Oher, because
I'm here to help you use those maps. . .

We'll get to that.
And the history books have it wrong.

Yes, Miss Sue.

Try it again.

1278
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,621
What's the next one? Read that
to me. Okay, what does it say?

1279
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:42,251
First we have to find the constant.
Now, where is the constant?

Good. See?

Courage is a hard thing to figure.

01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:24,559
You can have courage based
on a dumb idea or a mistake...

1459
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:27,020
...but you're not supposed to
question adults...

1460
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:31,441
...or your coach or your teacher
because they make the rules.

Maybe they know best,
but maybe they don't.

Should you always do
what others tell you to do?

1468

Sometimes you might not even know
why you're doing something.

1469

I mean, any fool can have courage.

1470
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:10,772
But honor, that's the real reason
you either do something or you don't.

1471
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:14,276
It's who you are
and maybe who you want to be.

01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:17,821
If you die trying for
something important...

1473
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:22,492
...then you have both honor and
courage, and that's pretty good.

I think that's what the writer was saying.

and try for honor.

That even Miss Sue makes donations?

they have a condo in Oxford.. .
