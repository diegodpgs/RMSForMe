1
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,688
Sharon!

2
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:32,088
She's not here.

3
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:36,162
Oh, God.
Christopher, can you see anything?

4
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,862
Sharon!

5
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,796
-Sharon!
-She's there.

6
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:45,167
Sharon!

7
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:48,637
Honey!

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,507
Sharon!

9
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:56,908
Wait for Mommy!

10
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:17,932
Sharon!

11
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:25,745
Wait.

12
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:39,592
Sharon! Honey!

13
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:55,199
Oh, my God. Sharon!

14
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,877
Home.

15
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:12,220
Home.

16
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:13,985
No!

17
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,731
-Home! Home!
-We're going home.

18
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,770
Silent Hill!

19
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:28,636
-Silent Hill!
-Rose!

20
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:30,777
-Wake up.
-Hey.

21
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,641
-It's okay, sweetie. We're here now.
-It's okay. It's okay.

22
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,338
It's okay.

23
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:39,276
It's okay, baby.
We're going right home.

24
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:42,115
-What are we gonna do?
-We'll get there.

25
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:45,191
We'll find a way through this.
We'll find a way.

26
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:46,985
No.

27
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:50,793
-She said it again.
-I know.

28
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:56,597
-Come on, baby. It's okay.
-Calm down, baby. It's okay.

29
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:58,329
-It's okay, baby.
-We're right here.

30
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,943
It's okay.

31
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:06,871
It's okay.

32
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,082
It's okay, baby.

33
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:41,238
-Wanna see?
-Sure.

34
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,883
What are you doing there, pumpkin?

35
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,152
This is an amazing lion.
Did you do that all by yourself?

36
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:54,058
I'm so impressed with you, honey.

37
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:05,531
Hey, you know we're going
on a special trip, don't you?

38
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,468
Do you know where we're going?

39
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:11,445
No?

40
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:15,207
Honey, sometimes when you go
to sleep, you go on a little walk.

41
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,648
And sometimes
you talk about a place...

42
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:21,716
...called Silent Hill.

43
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,657
I don't remember.

44
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,992
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

45
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:32,030
That's why we're gonna go there,
so you can remember.

46
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:43,170
Daddy's not coming?

47
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:47,272
No, sweetie.
It's gonna be just you and me.

48
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,822
Hey.

49
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:30,622
Hey.

50
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:33,860
Break's over, sweetie.

51
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,320
You awake?

52
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,260
You wanna go?

53
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:00,477
Damn it, Rose. What's going on?

54
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,825
Hi, this is Rose Da Silva.

55
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:09,752
Please leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

56
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,610
Oh, no, Rose.

57
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:38,192
No.

58
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:53,525
Honey, you're awake?

59
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:54,929
Long drive.

60
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:57,468
Can I ask you something, sweetie?

61
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:02,308
Why did you change your pictures?

62
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,506
I didn't.

63
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:08,739
-Mommy?
-You can't remember?

64
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,147
No. I don't like that, Mommy.

65
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:15,914
-Baby, you can't remember doing this?
-Who did that?

66
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:19,150
-Hey, hey, baby, it's okay.
-Mommy, who did that?

67
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,521
It's okay, honey. Mommy's here.

68
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:25,158
Can you wait in the car for me?

69
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,800
Can I sit in front?

70
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:31,735
-Of course you can sit in the front.
-Okay.

71
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,583
Jimmy, we need
a ham and cheese on white.

72
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:48,221
Hi.

73
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,952
I just wanna pay for the gas.

74
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,220
And can you tell me the best way
to get to Silent Hill?

75
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,399
I can't seem to find it on the map.

76
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,058
-Why do you wanna go there?
-l-- I read about it.

77
00:09:02,704 --> 00:09:05,036
Road don't go through no more.

78
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,935
Your card was declined.

79
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:12,870
Hey there.

80
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:17,641
-ls everything all right?
-Don't talk to strangers.

81
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,719
Good girl.

82
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:23,948
All right. Well, thanks for your help.

83
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,325
Why did you cut off the cards?

84
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:32,556
That's not gonna stop me
from taking her there.

85
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:35,702
Listen, honey,
we gotta put Sharon in a hospital.

86
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:38,198
She needs constant care,
and she needs medication.

87
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:41,106
The medication doesn't work.

88
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,903
She's getting worse every day.

89
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,773
Honey, the adoption people said
Sharon came from West Virginia...

90
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,517
...and Silent Hill is in West Virginia.

91
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:52,549
I'm not giving up on her, Chris.
I'm not.

92
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:54,688
Have you actually read
the websites, Rose?

93
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,619
Yes, Chris, I read them.

94
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:01,386
Just trust me on this, please?
Just trust me on this.

95
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,197
Listen, honey...

96
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:06,890
-I love Sharon every bit as much as l--
-Chris, I gotta go.

97
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,765
--I love you.

98
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:14,601
-Need any help, ma'am?
-No, we're-- We're fine, thanks.

99
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:18,939
We're fine.

100
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:36,780
Are we there?

101
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,350
Not yet, honey.

102
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:52,672
Keep your seatbelt fastened.

103
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:56,207
Hey!

104
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,925
Mommy!

105
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,855
It's okay. It's just the radio.

106
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,261
-I'm turning it off.
-Mommy!

107
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:46,980
Sharon?

108
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,321
Sharon!

109
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:59,027
Somebody! Help!

110
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,195
Please!

111
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:06,235
We've had an accident!

112
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,946
Anybody!

113
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:23,918
Sharon. Honey.

114
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:38,161
Ashes.

115
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:53,871
Sharon!

116
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,075
Sharon!

117
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:02,515
Wait!

118
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:04,423
Sharon!

119
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,115
Wait!

120
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,947
Sharon!

121
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:36,851
Sharon?

122
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:45,522
Honey?

123
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,474
What's happening?

124
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:43,250
Mommy.

125
00:17:44,758 --> 00:17:46,419
Sharon.

126
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:23,192
Sharon?

127
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,907
Sharon?

128
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:06,738
Hello?

129
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:28,189
Hey!

130
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:29,890
Wait!

131
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:31,621
Hey!

132
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,197
Sharon.

133
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:36,028
Sharon.

134
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:39,430
Sharon.

135
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,253
No!

136
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,907
Help me!

137
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:23,015
Help.

138
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,885
Help me. Help.

139
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:28,782
Someone! Shit!

140
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:35,489
Get off me! Get off!

141
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:10,261
Get off! Get off!

142
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,761
Get off me!

143
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:14,661
No! Get off me!

144
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:19,235
No! Get off me! Get off me!

145
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:36,953
Get off--!

146
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:32,001
Only the dark one opens
and closes the door to Silent Hill.

147
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:33,764
Please.

148
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:38,576
I don't know what's happening.
Do you know what's going on here?

149
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:42,308
My daughter.

150
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,512
I'm looking for my daughter.
I'm afraid that she's been hurt.

151
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:48,085
We've all lost our children.

152
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:50,153
Our light.

153
00:23:51,158 --> 00:23:53,126
They deceived me.

154
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:54,726
Their evil.

155
00:23:55,262 --> 00:23:57,457
Their hate.

156
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:01,960
They hurt my child.

157
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:04,137
They did terrible things to her.

158
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:07,133
Alessa.

159
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:11,371
This is my daughter, Sharon.

160
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:13,478
She sleepwalks,
so you have to be careful...

161
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,811
...but if you see her,
please, tell her to wait for me.

162
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:21,949
Yes, she's mine.

163
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:23,315
-lt was mine.
-It's mine.

164
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:25,355
-It's mine.
-It's mine!

165
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,356
-It's mine!
-Get off me!

166
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:38,697
Into the fire
she swallowed their hate.

167
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:09,425
-Hi there.
-Yeah.

168
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:14,832
Listen, my wife,
she came through here last night.

169
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,738
-Maybe you saw her?
-Daughter worked night shift.

170
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:25,010
Actually, she was heading
for this place, Silent Hill.

171
00:25:25,218 --> 00:25:27,379
-How do I get there?
-You don't.

172
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:29,556
Town's closed down
because of the coal fire...

173
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:32,247
...still burning underground,
you know?

174
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:34,984
Breathe enough of them fumes,
oh, bound to kill you.

175
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:39,521
Okay...

176
00:25:41,068 --> 00:25:43,059
...where's the turnoff?

177
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:57,844
Sharon?

178
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,350
Come on.

179
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:42,086
Hi, this is Chris.
Please leave a message.

180
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:44,263
Christopher, it's me.

181
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:48,423
I'm in Silent Hill.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

182
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:50,899
Sharon's lost,
but I think I know where she is...

183
00:26:51,104 --> 00:26:54,369
...so I'm going to the school
to look for her.

184
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:58,071
I'm not okay, all right?
I need your help.

185
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:01,941
Please, please, hurry.

186
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:05,809
Fuck. Come on!

187
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:08,453
Ma'am, I want you to put
both hands on the wheel.

188
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:13,625
Put both hands on the wheel.

189
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:17,626
Where's the little girl, ma'am?

190
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:21,428
Please, my daughter, she's gone.
I need your help.

191
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:23,603
-Get out of the car.
-What?

192
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:25,328
Move it.

193
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:28,200
Jesus, what are you doing?

194
00:27:28,408 --> 00:27:30,501
-You're under arrest.
-What?

195
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:33,703
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

196
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:36,678
I don't think you understand.
There's something weird going on.

197
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:38,407
My daughter, she's in danger.

198
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:40,711
If you really cared,
you wouldn't have sped off.

199
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:43,151
Listen to me, she 's ill.
She sleepwalks.

200
00:27:43,356 --> 00:27:45,722
Just calm right down.
I'm gonna find the little girl.

201
00:27:48,095 --> 00:27:50,427
Officer Bennett to base, over.

202
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,629
Base, do you copy, over?

203
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:57,730
-Shit.
-You're bleeding.

204
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:04,206
Cracked my head on the road
pretty good...

205
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:07,869
...when my bike went down.
I must have been out for a while.

206
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:11,580
-You all right to walk?
-Sure.

207
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:14,412
Then it looks like we'll be
hiking back to Brahams.

208
00:28:14,621 --> 00:28:15,918
What?

209
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,919
You're going back to the station.

210
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:21,253
-Are you kidding?
-Nope.

211
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:23,790
Have you heard
a single word I've said?

212
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:25,555
-Yeah, I hear you.
-Have you heard...

213
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,256
...a single word I've said?

214
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:30,863
I'm sure she's at the school,
we just need to turn around....

215
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:33,869
--Silent Hill--
--sorry--

216
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:35,632
--Sharon--
--lost--

217
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:41,439
--think I know where--
--going to the school to look for her--

218
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:43,115
I'm not okay--

219
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:47,514
I need your-- Your help.
Please, hurry!

220
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:08,036
Sorry, sir, this road is closed.
You'll have to turn around.

221
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:11,074
I'm looking for my wife.
She may have come through here.

222
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:16,314
She drives a Jeep Liberty.
Silver, Ohio plates.

223
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:20,880
Sir, this man's wife
was driving the Jeep.

224
00:29:21,855 --> 00:29:22,822
Bring him down.

225
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:24,650
-Come on.
-You've seen her?

226
00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:32,256
Where is she?

227
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:35,333
Inspector Thomas Gucci.
Enjoying the weather, are you?

228
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:37,765
For God's sake,
I'm trying to find my wife.

229
00:29:37,971 --> 00:29:39,199
I know. Hang on a second.

230
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:41,772
Now, that vehicle you were
talking about, we found it.

231
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:44,205
It's at the end of the bridge here,
but it's empty.

232
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:46,902
We've got no indication
anyone's come under any harm.

233
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:48,910
-Good Christ.
-Now, you mind telling me...

234
00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:51,083
...what your wife's doing
up here, Mr...?

235
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,377
-Da Silva, Chris Da Silva.
-My pleasure, Chris--

236
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:56,249
The faster we start looking,
the faster we're gonna find her.

237
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:58,924
All right, hold your horses,
hold your horses, Chris.

238
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:01,184
I've also got a missing deputy.

239
00:30:01,394 --> 00:30:03,487
And knowing Officer Cybil Bennett
the way I do...

240
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:06,461
...she's probably out there looking
for your wife and daughter.

241
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,964
Bobby, make sure no one
comes through that barricade.

242
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:11,069
We're gonna get our asses up
to Silent Hill.

243
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:12,829
-Let's take a look around.
-Yes, sir.

244
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,904
While Chris here tells me
what's going on.

245
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:19,605
She disappeared yesterday.
I spoke to her...

246
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,474
...when she stopped for gas
in Brahams.

247
00:30:22,182 --> 00:30:24,582
Why were you coming up here
in the middle of the night?

248
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:28,220
-I thought it would help her.
-You people. You get off the highway...

249
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:32,050
...from whatever big city, bringing
all your sick problems with you.

250
00:30:33,894 --> 00:30:36,158
Why aren't you listening to me?

251
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:38,761
We had a guy come up here
two years ago...

252
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:42,230
...snatched a little boy from a rest stop,
dropped him into a mine vent.

253
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:44,266
I never wanna see
anything like that again.

254
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:47,269
Look, I don't know what
you're thinking, but you're not helping.

255
00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:49,635
There is no way I would ever
harm my own daughter.

256
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:52,175
How do I even know
she is your daughter?

257
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:53,778
Come on.

258
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:00,481
What the hell?

259
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:38,251
Okay.

260
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,688
Now do you see
what I'm talking about?

261
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:42,486
Will you take these handcuffs
off me?

262
00:31:42,696 --> 00:31:45,096
No. Get walking.

263
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:47,926
There's a fire-lookout tower
on the far side of Toluca Lake.

264
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:50,864
-lt should have a radio.
-Fuck you, you stupid cop.

265
00:31:51,504 --> 00:31:54,371
This place is completely cut off.

266
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:57,643
-You have no idea what's going on.
-Hey!

267
00:31:58,812 --> 00:32:00,939
Hey, you up there!

268
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:04,241
I'm a police officer!

269
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:10,016
What's going on?

270
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:19,528
What is that?

271
00:32:24,004 --> 00:32:25,369
Stand back.

272
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,309
Jesus Christ, shoot it.

273
00:32:44,324 --> 00:32:45,814
Stay where you are!

274
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:49,017
Stop!

275
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:42,930
Sharon!

276
00:36:12,398 --> 00:36:14,161
Rose.

277
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:36,016
Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...

278
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:38,122
...and I will take you to safety.

279
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:41,191
Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...

280
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:43,362
...and I will take you to safety.

281
00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:46,259
-Why don't you let me do that?
-Ninety percent of the time...

282
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:47,797
...when a wife takes a run...

283
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:50,265
...she takes the daughter
to a place like this...

284
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,495
...I'd say she's damn mad
at her husband.

285
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,438
You like hauling skeletons
out of your family closet?

286
00:36:56,643 --> 00:37:00,079
No, not all the time, but we're
driving on top of them right now.

287
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,714
Coal fire's still burning
underneath.

288
00:37:02,915 --> 00:37:04,780
You see the barbershop over there?

289
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:07,845
-Used to be my father's.
-Your father?

290
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:11,085
He's dead.

291
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,857
November '74,
when the fire caught.

292
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,393
They tried to evacuate this place
as quick as they could...

293
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:20,566
...but it was hellish, people were
dying and disappearing.

294
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:23,429
Hell, they couldn't even find
half the bodies.

295
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:25,228
That was the end of Silent Hill.

296
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:28,635
These were good people,
most of them.

297
00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:31,206
Some, you might say deserved it.

298
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:32,935
A little bit.

299
00:37:48,828 --> 00:37:50,762
Sharon!

300
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:23,650
Sharon.

301
00:39:28,027 --> 00:39:29,324
Where are you hiding?

302
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:44,900
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!

303
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:49,046
Alessa Gillespie.

304
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:51,611
Hey!

305
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:57,382
Hey!

306
00:40:00,293 --> 00:40:01,351
Wait!

307
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,619
It's okay.

308
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:11,821
It's gonna be okay.

309
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:17,535
I promise I'm gonna help you.

310
00:43:07,446 --> 00:43:08,913
Come on.

311
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:11,279
Oh, God.

312
00:43:11,651 --> 00:43:13,209
Come on.

313
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:24,461
Help me. Oh, God.
Please, please, help me. Help--

314
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:32,635
Help me. Please, help me.
Help me. Help me, please.

315
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:27,649
It's happening again.

316
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:48,732
Help me! Please! Please!

317
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,505
Come on! Come on!

318
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:19,392
Rose!

319
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,729
Sharon!

320
00:47:26,505 --> 00:47:28,564
Rose!

321
00:48:32,271 --> 00:48:33,863
Rose!

322
00:48:44,783 --> 00:48:46,478
Rose.

323
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:04,164
-Rose!
-Put your mask on.

324
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,998
Rose, where are you?

325
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:15,770
-I felt her.
-You what?

326
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:17,312
Her perfume.

327
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:20,083
-She was here.
-Who was?

328
00:49:20,285 --> 00:49:22,310
-My wife.
-She wasn't here. Put this mask on.

329
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:25,285
-Perfume.
-Breathe. Through that mask.

330
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:29,386
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna go this way.

331
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:31,392
Chris, come on.

332
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:35,264
-She was here.
-No, no, she wasn't here.

333
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:36,434
I know it.

334
00:49:52,217 --> 00:49:53,479
Come on.

335
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:56,119
Come on. Let's keep looking.

336
00:50:23,048 --> 00:50:25,209
Get off! Get off! Get off!

337
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:41,029
Get me that pipe.

338
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:44,164
Rose, the pipe!

339
00:50:45,204 --> 00:50:47,331
Okay. Okay.

340
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:51,670
-I got it. I got it.
-Quick, come on!

341
00:51:07,092 --> 00:51:08,855
Can we get out of here?

342
00:51:09,428 --> 00:51:11,020
We're trapped.

343
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,097
Last mag.

344
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:15,960
-That's all the bullets you got?
-Yeah.

345
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:20,262
Thanks.

346
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:33,611
You hear that?

347
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,525
That's him.

348
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:50,858
Stay down! Stay down!

349
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:53,128
Jesus Christ.

350
00:51:54,773 --> 00:51:56,638
Get down!

351
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:05,341
Shit!

352
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:13,240
What?

353
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:54,222
What the fuck?

354
00:53:55,961 --> 00:53:56,928
What the fuck?

355
00:53:59,264 --> 00:54:01,960
You saw that, right?
That was real?

356
00:54:04,436 --> 00:54:05,869
What the fuck is going on?

357
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:08,767
All right, I know this is crazy. I know.

358
00:54:08,974 --> 00:54:11,374
We gotta calm right down,
because my kid is not here...

359
00:54:11,576 --> 00:54:14,477
...and I've gotta find her
before this happens again.

360
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,373
I don't even know where to start.

361
00:54:17,783 --> 00:54:19,444
I found this.

362
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:21,619
It's from a hotel.

363
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,755
I don't know where it is,
but she is in this hotel.

364
00:54:25,524 --> 00:54:27,185
Hotel?

365
00:54:30,629 --> 00:54:32,119
Hey.

366
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:36,024
It's gonna be okay.

367
00:54:37,769 --> 00:54:39,760
We're gonna be okay.

368
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:54,616
Now, don't be trying
anything, all right?

369
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,811
We got men up here
all night long.

370
00:54:57,022 --> 00:54:59,752
We're gonna find your wife,
we're gonna find your daughter.

371
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:02,859
Can't have civilians
wandering around on their own.

372
00:55:03,528 --> 00:55:05,655
You're not telling me everything.

373
00:55:06,965 --> 00:55:08,262
What really happened up here?

374
00:55:08,467 --> 00:55:10,765
Just let it rest in peace.

375
00:55:14,005 --> 00:55:16,405
-Directory assistance.
-Toluca County Archives, please.

376
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:18,098
One moment.

377
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,775
-Archives?
-Yeah, listen.

378
00:55:20,979 --> 00:55:23,573
Do you have the records there
from Silent Hill?

379
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:26,910
-Which records, sir?
-The police records.

380
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,553
Sorry, sir,
those records are confidential.

381
00:55:29,755 --> 00:55:31,916
No, no, I can't--
No, listen, l--

382
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,319
Sorry, sir,
I can't access that information.

383
00:55:34,526 --> 00:55:35,993
-Listen, goddamn it.
-Sir.

384
00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:37,593
-This is an emergency.
-I can't--

385
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:39,787
I can't help you.

386
00:55:56,047 --> 00:55:58,743
They used to say
this place was haunted.

387
00:55:59,384 --> 00:56:01,477
I think they were right.

388
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:13,523
Help! No!

389
00:56:13,732 --> 00:56:15,563
-Stay away.
-Come on.

390
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:18,668
Stay away, sinner.

391
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,201
Get back!

392
00:56:20,405 --> 00:56:22,202
Hey.

393
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:24,102
It's here.

394
00:56:25,944 --> 00:56:28,139
Faith is our destroyer.
Faith has brought us doom.

395
00:56:28,346 --> 00:56:30,211
-Get back!
-Hey, hey!

396
00:56:30,415 --> 00:56:33,350
-Get back!
-Hey, stop.

397
00:56:33,552 --> 00:56:35,918
Think you of thee
who cast the first stone.

398
00:56:36,121 --> 00:56:38,453
Lambs without a shepherd,
shepherd without a flock.

399
00:56:39,157 --> 00:56:41,216
It's your sins which hold you here.

400
00:56:41,426 --> 00:56:42,984
-Stop your lies!
-Calm down.

401
00:56:43,195 --> 00:56:44,162
Calm down, it's okay.

402
00:56:44,362 --> 00:56:46,455
-We're not gonna hurt you.
-She's gone.

403
00:56:47,466 --> 00:56:49,024
What's your name?

404
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:52,962
Anna. My name is Anna.

405
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:55,196
What's going on here, Anna?
Who was that?

406
00:56:55,407 --> 00:56:58,467
-I've seen her before.
-Dahlia was cast out.

407
00:56:58,677 --> 00:57:00,736
Not even the darkness wants her.

408
00:57:00,946 --> 00:57:03,540
-She's lost her daughter too.
-What?

409
00:57:03,748 --> 00:57:09,084
-Sinners deserve to lose their spawn.
-What are you doing here, Anna?

410
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:13,414
Mother needs more food.

411
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,617
You mean there are
other people here?

412
00:57:18,763 --> 00:57:20,731
Christabella keeps us safe.

413
00:57:20,932 --> 00:57:23,332
-Anna.
-We take refuge in the church.

414
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:26,769
Anna, listen to me.

415
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:29,739
I've lost my daughter.
She's all alone.

416
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:32,737
Can you imagine how frightened
she must feel?

417
00:57:32,944 --> 00:57:34,912
Tell me, have you seen her?

418
00:57:35,113 --> 00:57:36,478
Do you know where she is?

419
00:57:40,285 --> 00:57:43,220
If she has faith, she might survive.

420
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:44,388
If not....

421
00:57:47,392 --> 00:57:48,450
I'm taking this.

422
00:57:50,795 --> 00:57:52,490
Have you seen this?

423
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:55,328
I've seen it at the school.

424
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:59,700
It's on all the buildings
the elders of my elders built.

425
00:57:59,905 --> 00:58:04,365
It's a symbol of our unity,
a symbol of our faith.

426
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,481
Rose, look at this.

427
00:58:19,591 --> 00:58:22,719
-What is it?
-Just like yours.

428
00:58:24,162 --> 00:58:27,598
-Where did you find it?
-They're all over the floor.

429
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,074
Rose.

430
00:58:43,848 --> 00:58:45,406
Check this out.

431
00:58:47,285 --> 00:58:51,381
-What number did you take this from?
-1 1 1.

432
00:58:53,391 --> 00:58:55,689
We gotta go to room 1 1 1.

433
01:00:29,254 --> 01:00:30,846
Gucci.

434
01:01:01,386 --> 01:01:03,411
-Directory assistance.
-Yeah.

435
01:01:04,055 --> 01:01:06,615
Toluca County Orphanage, please.

436
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:08,816
One moment, please.

437
01:01:10,729 --> 01:01:13,027
-Yes, I have that information for you.
-Yeah.

438
01:01:14,032 --> 01:01:16,193
Can you give me that address?

439
01:01:25,043 --> 01:01:28,604
We are wandering far
from refuge here.

440
01:01:30,815 --> 01:01:33,716
Let's keep her with us.
She's all we got.

441
01:02:00,945 --> 01:02:02,572
There's no room 1 1 1.

442
01:02:02,781 --> 01:02:05,215
The first burning.

443
01:02:06,084 --> 01:02:09,576
-What is it, Anna?
-The first burning.

444
01:02:09,788 --> 01:02:11,722
Before the town had a name.

445
01:02:11,923 --> 01:02:15,381
The elders of my elders
kept us pure.

446
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,292
The founders of this town
were witch-hunters.

447
01:02:18,797 --> 01:02:21,288
Burning the witch
held back the darkness.

448
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:23,126
It stopped the apocalypse.

449
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,632
It's here.

450
01:02:47,025 --> 01:02:49,220
There's a room in here.

451
01:03:00,638 --> 01:03:02,265
Look at this.

452
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:11,772
Here.

453
01:03:12,483 --> 01:03:14,178
Damn.

454
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,495
What is this place?

455
01:03:31,703 --> 01:03:33,898
I don't know.
We're in the next building.

456
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:36,164
Some factory, maybe?

457
01:03:37,909 --> 01:03:40,036
Looks like there was a fire.

458
01:03:46,751 --> 01:03:48,150
Hey.

459
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,801
Rose!

460
01:04:41,606 --> 01:04:43,437
Who are you?

461
01:04:55,887 --> 01:04:57,650
It's okay.

462
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:02,189
Don't be scared.
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

463
01:05:20,511 --> 01:05:22,172
Rose?

464
01:05:44,035 --> 01:05:46,333
Okay. Come on.

465
01:05:46,537 --> 01:05:48,232
Come on.

466
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:55,604
It's okay. Hey.

467
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,313
Hey.

468
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:01,979
It's okay.

469
01:06:09,127 --> 01:06:10,424
It's okay.

470
01:06:10,628 --> 01:06:12,789
I'm not gonna hurt you.

471
01:06:23,107 --> 01:06:24,301
Oh, my God.

472
01:06:24,976 --> 01:06:27,035
You could be her twin.

473
01:06:31,249 --> 01:06:33,240
Are you Alessa?

474
01:06:34,986 --> 01:06:37,079
Where's my Sharon?

475
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:39,586
Look at me.

476
01:06:41,059 --> 01:06:43,027
I'm burning.

477
01:06:45,863 --> 01:06:47,353
Rose?

478
01:06:50,234 --> 01:06:51,326
Rose? My God.

479
01:06:52,303 --> 01:06:54,794
-How did you get over there?
-Where is she?

480
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:00,542
Grab onto it.

481
01:07:01,979 --> 01:07:05,540
-Now swing back around.
-Okay.

482
01:07:10,354 --> 01:07:11,719
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

483
01:07:12,123 --> 01:07:13,818
What the hell
were you doing over there?

484
01:07:14,025 --> 01:07:15,515
You're gonna get yourself killed.

485
01:07:16,294 --> 01:07:18,387
I think I just saw Dahlia's daughter.

486
01:07:20,098 --> 01:07:21,793
She was the one
that brought us here.

487
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:23,261
What are you talking about?

488
01:07:23,468 --> 01:07:25,868
She was the one
that made me crash my car.

489
01:07:26,571 --> 01:07:27,765
Alessa.

490
01:07:27,972 --> 01:07:30,167
We don't say her name.

491
01:07:33,945 --> 01:07:36,470
That's the seal, isn't it, Anna?

492
01:07:37,482 --> 01:07:39,848
The symbol of your faith?

493
01:07:42,587 --> 01:07:44,782
Something terrible happened here.

494
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:52,189
We have to leave.
We have to leave!

495
01:07:53,498 --> 01:07:55,693
-The darkness is coming!
-Let's go.

496
01:07:56,134 --> 01:07:57,726
Let's go!

497
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:11,777
The church isn't far.

498
01:08:11,983 --> 01:08:13,883
-Run. Run!
-Rose, come on!

499
01:08:14,085 --> 01:08:15,780
Rose!

500
01:08:25,696 --> 01:08:27,323
Hurry!

501
01:08:34,505 --> 01:08:35,699
Rose.

502
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:38,398
-Come!
-We gotta go.

503
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,994
-Rose, come on.
-I've seen this.

504
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,335
Rose, let's go!

505
01:09:13,444 --> 01:09:16,038
-Cybil!
-Rose, come on.

506
01:09:24,021 --> 01:09:24,988
Cybil!

507
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:28,056
You run not towards sanctuary
but from your fears.

508
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:30,989
Do not join the others.
They are deceivers. They are damned.

509
01:09:31,195 --> 01:09:32,753
-We gotta get inside.
-No!

510
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:34,522
They are wolves
in the skin of sheep.

511
01:09:34,732 --> 01:09:37,565
They brought about their own hell.
They'll take you with them.

512
01:09:37,768 --> 01:09:39,998
-Filth and lies!
-Hey!

513
01:09:40,204 --> 01:09:41,603
Stop it!

514
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,068
Please. I've seen your daughter.
I've seen Alessa.

515
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,674
-It's coming!
-She's dead, isn't she?

516
01:09:51,882 --> 01:09:53,543
Fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens.

517
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:56,042
-Listen to me.
-Rose, hurry!

518
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,479
She looks exactly like Sharon.

519
01:09:58,689 --> 01:10:01,123
She brought us here, didn't she?

520
01:10:04,862 --> 01:10:07,057
Why? What does she want?

521
01:10:07,265 --> 01:10:08,926
Evil wakes in vengeance.

522
01:10:09,133 --> 01:10:11,761
Be careful what you choose.

523
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:33,212
Rose!

524
01:11:07,325 --> 01:11:08,724
Oh, God, no.

525
01:11:30,748 --> 01:11:32,079
-Witches!
-She's evil.

526
01:11:32,283 --> 01:11:33,477
Keep away the witches!

527
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:39,022
-No.
-Send them back!

528
01:11:39,657 --> 01:11:41,056
No.

529
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,092
We're lost.

530
01:11:53,371 --> 01:11:54,838
This is a sanctuary.

531
01:12:04,915 --> 01:12:08,373
Please, Christabella,
they lured my Anna.

532
01:12:08,586 --> 01:12:11,020
They gave her to the fiend.

533
01:12:11,355 --> 01:12:14,950
Eleanor, you must remember
that Anna went against our laws.

534
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:17,855
She went alone outside
into the devil's playground.

535
01:12:20,064 --> 01:12:23,363
She was not the responsibility
of these two strangers.

536
01:12:25,336 --> 01:12:27,463
We'll deal with them later.

537
01:12:33,411 --> 01:12:35,402
Now we must pray.

538
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:57,561
And then I saw them...

539
01:12:57,768 --> 01:13:01,169
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

540
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:04,199
And no home was left to them.

541
01:13:04,408 --> 01:13:06,501
And then I saw them...

542
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:09,975
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

543
01:13:10,181 --> 01:13:12,877
And no home was left to them.

544
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:16,080
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

545
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,450
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

546
01:13:19,657 --> 01:13:24,685
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

547
01:13:24,895 --> 01:13:28,092
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

548
01:13:30,634 --> 01:13:35,003
And anyone's name not found
written in the book of life...

549
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:38,369
...they will be thrown
into the lake of fire.

550
01:13:48,853 --> 01:13:51,720
And now I lay me down to sleep...

551
01:13:51,922 --> 01:13:54,823
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

552
01:13:55,025 --> 01:13:57,493
If I should die before I wake...

553
01:13:58,028 --> 01:14:01,259
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

554
01:14:01,465 --> 01:14:03,296
Amen.

555
01:14:03,701 --> 01:14:06,431
All right, girls, into bed.
Quickly, now.

556
01:14:06,637 --> 01:14:09,231
No better place to be
on a rainy night.

557
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,807
In you go, Lindsey, thattagirl.
You've got your bear, that's a girl.

558
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:15,410
No. No talking
after lights are out.

559
01:14:19,183 --> 01:14:21,117
Good night, children.

560
01:14:21,318 --> 01:14:23,309
And God bless.

561
01:14:27,324 --> 01:14:29,815
I'm sorry, Sister Margaret,
this really can't wait.

562
01:14:30,728 --> 01:14:32,525
I can't imagine why.

563
01:14:34,465 --> 01:14:36,262
Nine years ago...

564
01:14:36,467 --> 01:14:38,458
...a baby was left
outside this orphanage.

565
01:14:38,669 --> 01:14:40,762
My wife and I were the ones
who adopted her.

566
01:14:40,971 --> 01:14:43,769
I'm very happy for you,
Mr. Da Silva...

567
01:14:43,974 --> 01:14:47,774
...but I can't give out
information on our children.

568
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,677
Look.

569
01:14:52,049 --> 01:14:55,041
That girl, she looks
exactly like my daughter.

570
01:14:55,252 --> 01:14:57,243
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

571
01:14:57,454 --> 01:15:00,082
-It's late.
-She must be 40 now.

572
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:01,485
Where can I find her?

573
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:04,259
This story isn't hers alone...

574
01:15:04,461 --> 01:15:06,156
-...but all of ours!
-You people.

575
01:15:06,363 --> 01:15:07,523
You got yourself something.

576
01:15:07,731 --> 01:15:10,700
You know what you got now, Chris?
How about breaking and entering?

577
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:12,994
By the looks of this,
a little assault as well.

578
01:15:13,704 --> 01:15:15,399
Thank you, Thomas.

579
01:15:15,606 --> 01:15:18,234
-This can't go any farther.
-lt won't, Sister.

580
01:15:19,743 --> 01:15:21,904
You know,
I have some 1 2-year-olds...

581
01:15:22,112 --> 01:15:24,478
...who cover their tracks
better than you do.

582
01:15:24,882 --> 01:15:26,179
What's this?

583
01:15:26,383 --> 01:15:27,941
Look, Gucci, do you know her?

584
01:15:28,152 --> 01:15:30,586
Is that my daughter's birth mother?

585
01:15:35,826 --> 01:15:39,262
-Look, turn around.
-What are you doing?

586
01:15:41,365 --> 01:15:44,391
I knew that girl. I did.

587
01:15:45,569 --> 01:15:48,094
I was told she didn't make it
through the night.

588
01:15:48,572 --> 01:15:50,506
The night of the fire.

589
01:15:50,774 --> 01:15:52,765
The night of the big fire
in Silent Hill.

590
01:15:55,112 --> 01:15:57,512
There were these people...

591
01:15:59,483 --> 01:16:00,677
...these fanatics.

592
01:16:00,884 --> 01:16:04,115
What they did
to that child was terrible.

593
01:16:04,355 --> 01:16:07,051
That was 30 years ago,
and it's over now.

594
01:16:07,524 --> 01:16:09,116
Not as far as I'm concerned.

595
01:16:09,793 --> 01:16:11,818
What's it gonna be, city boy?

596
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:14,520
I can put you in jail...

597
01:16:14,732 --> 01:16:16,393
...or you can go home.

598
01:16:17,034 --> 01:16:19,730
And that's your definition of justice?

599
01:16:20,904 --> 01:16:24,635
Many different forms
of justice, Chris.

600
01:16:25,376 --> 01:16:28,402
See, you've got man's, God's...

601
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,313
...and even the devil's.

602
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,480
Certain forms you just can't control.

603
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:38,648
So I want you to go home now...

604
01:16:39,056 --> 01:16:41,286
...to your nice warm bed...

605
01:16:41,492 --> 01:16:43,926
...and let me deal with this town...

606
01:16:44,128 --> 01:16:46,858
...and what has happened
over the last 30 years.

607
01:16:47,064 --> 01:16:49,828
Okay? End of story.

608
01:17:02,246 --> 01:17:04,646
Tell me first how you got here.

609
01:17:06,784 --> 01:17:09,252
Honestly, I don't know
how I got here.

610
01:17:09,453 --> 01:17:12,320
Right now, I've lost my little girl...

611
01:17:12,523 --> 01:17:15,151
...and all I know is that
I'm supposed to be in this church.

612
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:17,384
Are you a person of faith?

613
01:17:17,594 --> 01:17:19,858
-I love my daughter.
-That's not what I asked.

614
01:17:20,264 --> 01:17:21,390
Who are you to judge?

615
01:17:21,598 --> 01:17:24,795
We judge because the souls of history
hang in the balance.

616
01:17:25,002 --> 01:17:26,629
Because our faith
has never failed us.

617
01:17:26,837 --> 01:17:29,271
Our faith keeps the darkness
of hell at bay.

618
01:17:29,473 --> 01:17:33,068
Then use your faith
to help me find my little girl.

619
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:35,736
Only the demon knows where she is.

620
01:17:35,946 --> 01:17:38,176
Then tell me,
where do I find this demon?

621
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:42,541
No one has ever returned
from the core of the darkness...

622
01:17:42,753 --> 01:17:44,152
...where the demon lies in wait.

623
01:17:44,354 --> 01:17:45,787
She's not gonna help us.
Let's go.

624
01:17:45,989 --> 01:17:48,514
If you wish to face the demon
to find your daughter...

625
01:17:48,726 --> 01:17:49,920
...I won't stop you.

626
01:17:50,127 --> 01:17:52,789
-Christabella, they can't go down--
-Silence, Adam.

627
01:17:56,533 --> 01:17:59,195
Perhaps your faith will protect you.

628
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:01,729
Perhaps not.

629
01:18:15,586 --> 01:18:17,816
If you don't wanna do this...

630
01:18:18,822 --> 01:18:20,813
...I'll understand.

631
01:18:22,025 --> 01:18:23,993
Sharon's adopted...

632
01:18:24,895 --> 01:18:26,123
...but I'm her mother.

633
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:29,390
I knew that from the moment
I first laid eyes on her.

634
01:18:31,735 --> 01:18:33,635
She's lucky to have you.

635
01:18:35,072 --> 01:18:37,768
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

636
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:50,112
Quiet.

637
01:19:50,414 --> 01:19:52,939
We're in his domain now.

638
01:19:58,422 --> 01:20:00,686
Look at this map. Memorize it.

639
01:20:01,725 --> 01:20:03,852
Your memory may save your life.

640
01:20:05,262 --> 01:20:08,197
-Do you see this room?
-Yeah.

641
01:20:08,398 --> 01:20:11,094
That is where the darkness lies.

642
01:20:11,301 --> 01:20:13,701
The demon is in the bowels
of this building.

643
01:20:13,904 --> 01:20:16,270
It hides behind the face
of an innocent.

644
01:20:16,473 --> 01:20:17,770
You mean a child?

645
01:20:17,975 --> 01:20:20,239
Don't believe your eyes.
Your eyes will lie to you.

646
01:20:20,444 --> 01:20:23,504
Faith is the only truth.

647
01:20:24,581 --> 01:20:25,775
I will pray for you, Rose...

648
01:20:25,983 --> 01:20:29,248
...but I won't expect you
and your friend to return.

649
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,644
Goodbye.

650
01:20:34,091 --> 01:20:35,456
Adam.

651
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,151
Left. Right.

652
01:20:39,863 --> 01:20:42,195
Left. Left.

653
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:47,335
-Right. Right. Left.
-Take them to the lower level.

654
01:20:47,537 --> 01:20:49,334
-ln the basement?
-Do it, then return.

655
01:20:49,539 --> 01:20:51,905
-Left. 3A.
-But--

656
01:20:52,109 --> 01:20:53,667
-Right. 4A.
-I said, do it.

657
01:20:54,511 --> 01:20:58,003
-Left. Left. Right.
-Rose. Rose.

658
01:20:58,582 --> 01:21:03,076
-Left. Right. Left. Left.
-Rose, she's killing you.

659
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:05,585
-Rose!
-Let me do this.

660
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:08,751
I need to do this.

661
01:21:26,777 --> 01:21:28,335
Take this.

662
01:21:28,545 --> 01:21:32,379
They'll be drawn to the light,
but you won't be able to see without it.

663
01:21:35,218 --> 01:21:36,913
Thank you.

664
01:21:43,327 --> 01:21:46,091
-So this thing actually works?
-lt will.

665
01:21:46,296 --> 01:21:48,287
If the demon wants you, it will.

666
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,694
Forgive me.

667
01:21:53,103 --> 01:21:55,765
We've lived too long as scavengers.
I believe this is yours.

668
01:22:03,413 --> 01:22:06,109
Witch! Her child's
the likeness of Alessa.

669
01:22:06,316 --> 01:22:07,647
Her child's the next vessel.

670
01:22:07,851 --> 01:22:10,649
Stop her!
Don't let the witches go down!

671
01:22:15,525 --> 01:22:17,049
Come on!

672
01:22:26,636 --> 01:22:27,933
Get off her!

673
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:31,437
Find her.

674
01:22:32,175 --> 01:22:34,837
No! Wait! Cybil!

675
01:22:35,045 --> 01:22:37,172
Cybil! Open the door!

676
01:23:00,037 --> 01:23:02,665
No!

677
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:32,919
8A.

678
01:24:33,463 --> 01:24:37,763
7A. Right.

679
01:24:47,878 --> 01:24:51,075
Right. 6A.

680
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:54,449
4A.

681
01:24:55,485 --> 01:24:57,316
3A.

682
01:24:59,956 --> 01:25:02,686
Left, left. Right, right.

683
01:25:02,893 --> 01:25:05,555
Left, left.

684
01:26:19,603 --> 01:26:23,539
Okay. I can do this.

685
01:27:34,611 --> 01:27:37,512
Congratulations, Rose.

686
01:27:37,714 --> 01:27:39,306
You're here.

687
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,474
You did it.

688
01:27:44,254 --> 01:27:48,623
Your reward is the truth.

689
01:27:51,361 --> 01:27:55,457
Did you see that Alessa
was a good little girl?

690
01:27:58,168 --> 01:28:01,660
Even though nobody
looked at her that way.

691
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:07,877
-Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
-Their parents told them she was bad.

692
01:28:08,945 --> 01:28:12,278
She didn't have a father
like they did.

693
01:28:18,588 --> 01:28:21,523
Alessa was alone in the world.

694
01:28:25,895 --> 01:28:30,332
You know what can happen
to little girls when they're left alone.

695
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:36,396
It's okay, it's me, come on.

696
01:28:36,606 --> 01:28:38,972
Even her mother couldn't help.

697
01:28:41,378 --> 01:28:44,347
Even though she loved her baby.

698
01:28:45,248 --> 01:28:48,149
But the rest of the family
didn't love Alessa.

699
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:51,616
They were just like the others
and made her scared.

700
01:28:51,821 --> 01:28:53,686
We know.
Even the children know it.

701
01:28:53,890 --> 01:28:55,380
Your daughter....

702
01:28:56,726 --> 01:28:59,024
Why you won't
just name the father....

703
01:29:02,499 --> 01:29:05,161
You've brought sin amongst us.

704
01:29:05,368 --> 01:29:07,302
The faithful must gather
in judgment...

705
01:29:07,504 --> 01:29:10,564
...for we are called to purify this filth.

706
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,671
What does she mean, Mommy?

707
01:29:13,243 --> 01:29:16,542
You're weak, my dear sister.
You always were.

708
01:29:16,746 --> 01:29:20,238
Trust us, Dahlia.
Have faith in our virtue.

709
01:29:20,450 --> 01:29:22,941
We will restore innocence.

710
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:27,818
They had met many times
since the town was built...

711
01:29:28,024 --> 01:29:31,221
...to restore innocence and purity.

712
01:29:32,228 --> 01:29:34,423
They had a special place for that.

713
01:29:46,943 --> 01:29:49,377
Do you remember the hotel?

714
01:29:49,946 --> 01:29:52,710
I led you to all these places...

715
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:56,352
...and you were very good
at following my clues.

716
01:29:57,153 --> 01:29:59,348
You may leave, Dahlia.

717
01:30:00,123 --> 01:30:01,954
We fight the sin, not the sinner.

718
01:30:02,559 --> 01:30:04,754
Mommy! Mommy!

719
01:30:05,495 --> 01:30:07,019
Mommy!

720
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:10,529
You know how that feels,
don't you, Rose?

721
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,432
To lose your little girl?

722
01:30:14,204 --> 01:30:16,297
What have I done?

723
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:23,107
-Oh, God.
-Weep not for the demon.

724
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,908
No!

725
01:30:25,114 --> 01:30:28,880
Once again
we are locked in mortal battle.

726
01:30:29,519 --> 01:30:33,080
They thought they knew
how to cast out evil.

727
01:30:34,257 --> 01:30:38,023
-Praise God for our clarity.
-Amen.

728
01:30:38,228 --> 01:30:42,426
Praise the innocent
for their sacrifice.

729
01:30:42,632 --> 01:30:44,600
But you should be careful
how you fight evil.

730
01:30:44,801 --> 01:30:47,895
-They give us back our purity.
-Purity.

731
01:30:51,074 --> 01:30:52,974
-And our unity.
-Unity.

732
01:30:53,176 --> 01:30:56,805
Your weapons
can turn back on you.

733
01:31:22,305 --> 01:31:23,636
No.

734
01:31:25,408 --> 01:31:26,739
No.

735
01:31:26,943 --> 01:31:30,003
Now you know
why Dahlia is broken.

736
01:31:31,648 --> 01:31:34,014
She tried to get help...

737
01:31:34,217 --> 01:31:36,344
...but she went too late.

738
01:31:37,754 --> 01:31:39,949
Get her up, boys.
Get her up now!

739
01:31:40,323 --> 01:31:42,587
There were good people
in the town...

740
01:31:42,792 --> 01:31:45,022
...people like you, Rose.

741
01:31:45,228 --> 01:31:47,662
People who like to help.

742
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,734
Alessa was so lonely
and hurt and scared.

743
01:31:55,305 --> 01:31:58,001
They should have known better
than to hurt her so badly.

744
01:32:01,411 --> 01:32:04,005
When you're hurt
and scared for so long...

745
01:32:04,981 --> 01:32:07,415
...your fear and pain turn to hate...

746
01:32:07,617 --> 01:32:11,678
...and the hate
starts to change the world.

747
01:32:14,524 --> 01:32:19,427
Alessa 's hate grew and grew,
burning inside her.

748
01:32:23,733 --> 01:32:26,395
Her hate got so strong...

749
01:32:27,003 --> 01:32:30,734
...she even hurt someone
who was only curious.

750
01:32:45,088 --> 01:32:47,249
That's when I came.

751
01:32:54,364 --> 01:32:56,298
I told her it was their turn.

752
01:32:58,234 --> 01:33:03,934
I promised they would all
fall into her darkest dream.

753
01:33:33,636 --> 01:33:38,300
Now, Rose, we must talk.

754
01:34:31,027 --> 01:34:33,393
Don't be afraid.

755
01:34:39,669 --> 01:34:41,569
She won't hurt you.

756
01:34:42,205 --> 01:34:44,400
She needs your help.

757
01:34:44,607 --> 01:34:45,801
Who is she?

758
01:34:46,876 --> 01:34:49,970
-She is Alessa.
-Then who are you?

759
01:34:50,413 --> 01:34:54,349
I have many names.

760
01:34:54,917 --> 01:34:58,717
Right now,
I'm the dark part of Alessa.

761
01:35:00,156 --> 01:35:01,555
Where's my child?

762
01:35:02,058 --> 01:35:05,050
She's not your child.

763
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:08,427
She's hers.

764
01:35:09,532 --> 01:35:13,229
The little girl is
what's left of her goodness.

765
01:35:13,569 --> 01:35:15,161
We hid her in safety...

766
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,503
...in the world outside this hell.

767
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:35,720
Now the dream
of this life must end...

768
01:35:35,925 --> 01:35:39,793
...and so, too,
must the dreamers within it.

769
01:35:39,996 --> 01:35:42,328
For over 30 years...

770
01:35:42,532 --> 01:35:45,626
...they've lied to their own souls.

771
01:35:45,835 --> 01:35:50,067
For 30 years they've denied
their own fate.

772
01:35:50,273 --> 01:35:53,401
But now is the end of days...

773
01:35:53,609 --> 01:35:56,442
...and I am the reaper.

774
01:35:56,946 --> 01:35:58,607
What do you want?

775
01:35:58,948 --> 01:36:01,314
All we ask for is satisfaction.

776
01:36:01,951 --> 01:36:03,316
Satisfaction?

777
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:06,120
Revenge.

778
01:36:07,957 --> 01:36:09,652
Why me?

779
01:36:10,126 --> 01:36:12,060
You chose.

780
01:36:12,528 --> 01:36:14,826
You chose Sharon.

781
01:36:15,031 --> 01:36:18,296
Christabella will find Sharon.

782
01:36:18,501 --> 01:36:21,368
She plans to purify her.

783
01:36:23,639 --> 01:36:25,630
Oh, God, no.

784
01:36:26,275 --> 01:36:29,642
Their blind conviction
repels me from their church.

785
01:36:30,446 --> 01:36:33,506
I cannot enter
while they deny their fate...

786
01:36:33,716 --> 01:36:35,183
...but you can.

787
01:36:36,085 --> 01:36:40,852
-Just tell me what I need to do.
-Tell them the truth.

788
01:37:53,729 --> 01:37:55,629
The child is mine!

789
01:37:55,831 --> 01:37:57,799
Mine!

790
01:38:03,339 --> 01:38:05,204
She's mine.

791
01:38:07,009 --> 01:38:08,874
She's mine!

792
01:38:14,884 --> 01:38:18,115
The truth is clear to those who see.

793
01:38:19,221 --> 01:38:22,816
Just as I could see
you had this child.

794
01:38:41,644 --> 01:38:43,168
Let's go.

795
01:38:45,881 --> 01:38:48,941
Out of the car. Turn around.

796
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,968
Just a friendly warning...

797
01:39:06,569 --> 01:39:09,003
...I'll be back with people
who know what they're doing.

798
01:39:11,841 --> 01:39:15,572
Before you do that, Chris,
I wanna tell you about Officer Bennett.

799
01:39:17,213 --> 01:39:20,205
Few years back, some wacko,
he abducted a kid...

800
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:23,544
...threw him down a mine vent
up there in Silent Hill.

801
01:39:23,953 --> 01:39:26,217
Cybil Bennett, she found that boy.

802
01:39:26,422 --> 01:39:28,117
She spent three days
holding onto him...

803
01:39:28,324 --> 01:39:30,519
...keeping him alive
until they were rescued.

804
01:39:30,726 --> 01:39:32,159
We know what we're doing.

805
01:39:32,361 --> 01:39:34,329
I need to do everything I can.

806
01:39:41,303 --> 01:39:43,100
Let's go.

807
01:40:06,796 --> 01:40:08,991
Please.
Christabella, let her live.

808
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:11,428
Your weakness
led these souls to judgment.

809
01:40:11,634 --> 01:40:13,898
-This time you will bear witness.
-She is innocent.

810
01:40:14,103 --> 01:40:17,095
Look at her.
She's the whelp of your daughter.

811
01:40:17,306 --> 01:40:18,500
The demon!

812
01:40:19,075 --> 01:40:24,308
The demon fathered this disgusting
abomination from her child!

813
01:40:24,513 --> 01:40:25,537
No, she's mine!

814
01:40:28,717 --> 01:40:30,776
Sharon. Sharon, look at me.

815
01:40:30,986 --> 01:40:33,546
Look at me. Don't be afraid.

816
01:40:33,756 --> 01:40:37,248
It's okay, it's okay.
Your mama's coming.

817
01:40:38,027 --> 01:40:41,690
Once again we are called upon
to restore innocence.

818
01:40:41,897 --> 01:40:45,765
We burn this witch.
We vanquish evil.

819
01:40:46,702 --> 01:40:48,863
No. You can't. You can't.

820
01:40:49,071 --> 01:40:51,699
-Don't let her say this! No!
-We burn the child!

821
01:40:51,907 --> 01:40:54,102
We fight the demon!

822
01:40:57,113 --> 01:40:58,375
She's just a child!

823
01:40:58,581 --> 01:41:01,516
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

824
01:41:01,984 --> 01:41:03,918
Let her go!

825
01:41:04,386 --> 01:41:06,581
Leave her alone!

826
01:41:06,789 --> 01:41:08,416
Leave her alone!

827
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:10,990
Those who aid the demon...

828
01:41:11,193 --> 01:41:14,993
...they must be cleansed
by the fire from whence they came.

829
01:41:15,197 --> 01:41:17,757
That's crazy. You're crazy.

830
01:41:18,534 --> 01:41:20,695
No!

831
01:41:20,903 --> 01:41:22,530
Why are you listening to this?

832
01:41:22,738 --> 01:41:25,036
Why?

833
01:41:26,876 --> 01:41:29,811
Burn the witch! Burn her!

834
01:41:30,012 --> 01:41:35,109
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch!

835
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:43,955
Sharon.

836
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,225
Evil witch!

837
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:56,161
Suffer.

838
01:42:00,609 --> 01:42:03,237
Burn the witch! Burn her!

839
01:42:03,445 --> 01:42:07,211
Burn the witch! Burn her!

840
01:42:12,621 --> 01:42:14,987
Oh, my God.

841
01:42:22,264 --> 01:42:27,361
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn her!

842
01:42:27,570 --> 01:42:32,667
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn her!

843
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:34,433
Burn her!

844
01:42:36,845 --> 01:42:39,177
You're in your own hell.

845
01:42:47,356 --> 01:42:51,087
Mama, be with me.

846
01:43:14,483 --> 01:43:16,348
Here is where the apocalypse began.

847
01:43:16,552 --> 01:43:19,385
This is where we stopped
the annihilation of the world.

848
01:43:19,588 --> 01:43:22,079
We drew a line in the sand
and said:

849
01:43:22,291 --> 01:43:24,725
"Demon, you will not cross!"

850
01:43:24,927 --> 01:43:28,590
But the demon is wicked,
full of treachery.

851
01:43:28,797 --> 01:43:32,961
Yet again he comes to tempt us
in the guise of an innocent.

852
01:43:33,168 --> 01:43:35,159
To rid the world of this demon...

853
01:43:35,371 --> 01:43:37,999
...we must burn this child!

854
01:43:39,842 --> 01:43:41,833
That's not gonna happen!

855
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,847
Mommy!

856
01:43:46,949 --> 01:43:50,350
It's okay, baby.
Everything's gonna be okay.

857
01:43:50,552 --> 01:43:52,281
Oh, my God.

858
01:43:52,488 --> 01:43:54,547
Oh, my God.

859
01:43:54,757 --> 01:43:56,884
What have you people done?

860
01:43:57,092 --> 01:44:00,357
-You have returned.
-Yes, I have.

861
01:44:00,996 --> 01:44:02,987
The witch has returned.

862
01:44:05,968 --> 01:44:09,597
Do not believe her lies.

863
01:44:10,039 --> 01:44:12,007
I come from a world
outside this place.

864
01:44:12,474 --> 01:44:14,237
I come from a world full of life!

865
01:44:17,746 --> 01:44:19,236
Why don't you tell them the truth.

866
01:44:19,448 --> 01:44:22,884
Tell them the truth that you deny,
even to yourself.

867
01:44:23,085 --> 01:44:25,246
There was no apocalypse!

868
01:44:25,454 --> 01:44:27,479
You burned in the fire
that you started...

869
01:44:27,690 --> 01:44:30,989
...and nothing can save you
because you're already damned!

870
01:44:32,861 --> 01:44:34,158
-Mommy!
-Take her.

871
01:44:34,563 --> 01:44:36,929
Burn her. Burn her as a witch.

872
01:44:37,566 --> 01:44:40,160
Burn her! Burn her!

873
01:44:40,569 --> 01:44:41,866
Demon witch!

874
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:43,629
-Burn me?
-Demon witch.

875
01:44:43,839 --> 01:44:45,773
That's your answer.

876
01:44:46,342 --> 01:44:48,310
Burn anything you're afraid of.

877
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:51,035
Burn anything you can't control.

878
01:44:52,948 --> 01:44:56,384
This woman uses your fear
to control you.

879
01:44:56,585 --> 01:44:59,110
She led you to burn
Alessa Gillespie.

880
01:44:59,321 --> 01:45:02,154
She led you to burn
an innocent child.

881
01:45:02,358 --> 01:45:05,555
But you will not deny your guilt...

882
01:45:05,761 --> 01:45:08,286
...and you cannot deny her pain!

883
01:45:08,497 --> 01:45:11,660
That child was sin incarnate.

884
01:45:12,167 --> 01:45:15,694
No, it's you who have sinned.

885
01:45:16,972 --> 01:45:19,998
You darkened the heart
of an innocent...

886
01:45:20,209 --> 01:45:24,077
...and now you cower in the face
of Alessa's revenge.

887
01:45:24,279 --> 01:45:26,247
-Sinner.
-Heresy.

888
01:45:26,448 --> 01:45:28,473
Burn her. Burn her!

889
01:45:29,818 --> 01:45:33,845
Your faith brings death!

890
01:45:35,224 --> 01:45:37,158
You are alone in this limbo...

891
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:40,123
...and God is not here.

892
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:42,588
Mommy!

893
01:45:55,978 --> 01:46:00,005
She was a blasphemer.

894
01:46:00,849 --> 01:46:03,283
Blasphemer!

895
01:46:06,255 --> 01:46:08,086
Blasphemer!

896
01:47:23,665 --> 01:47:25,428
What have you done?

897
01:47:26,335 --> 01:47:28,269
You've brought the darkness in
with you.

898
01:47:29,338 --> 01:47:31,397
Do you know what you've done?

899
01:47:40,549 --> 01:47:42,449
For Sharon.

900
01:47:47,155 --> 01:47:48,850
Mommy.

901
01:47:49,057 --> 01:47:51,924
Mommy. Mommy.

902
01:49:05,434 --> 01:49:07,026
Mommy!

903
01:49:35,964 --> 01:49:39,900
Oh, Lord, give me the strength
to stay pure.

904
01:50:14,169 --> 01:50:16,694
No! No!

905
01:50:48,704 --> 01:50:52,834
Alessa, what have you become?

906
01:51:06,922 --> 01:51:08,822
Mommy!

907
01:51:10,058 --> 01:51:13,494
Sharon! Sharon, honey, it's me.
It's Mommy.

908
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,081
Down! We're getting down.

909
01:51:36,284 --> 01:51:38,718
Shut your eyes.
Shut your eyes, baby.

910
01:51:39,788 --> 01:51:41,483
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

911
01:51:50,298 --> 01:51:52,493
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

912
01:51:52,701 --> 01:51:56,193
It's just a bad dream.
It's just a bad dream.

913
01:52:44,886 --> 01:52:48,344
Why did she not take me
with the others?

914
01:52:50,225 --> 01:52:52,352
Because you're her mother.

915
01:52:57,265 --> 01:53:00,257
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

916
01:53:28,363 --> 01:53:30,194
I love you.

917
01:54:39,334 --> 01:54:41,598
-Hi, this is Chris.
-And this is Rose.

918
01:54:41,803 --> 01:54:43,600
And I'm Sharon Da Silva.

919
01:54:43,805 --> 01:54:46,205
Please leave a message!

920
01:54:48,143 --> 01:54:50,737
Christopher, it's me.

921
01:54:51,346 --> 01:54:52,608
I'm with Sharon.

922
01:54:54,716 --> 01:54:58,083
Hello? Hello? Rose?

923
01:54:58,553 --> 01:54:59,986
Rose?

924
01:55:01,222 --> 01:55:03,816
Yeah. We're coming home.
