1
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,123
Now, that's a roar, Boog.

2
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:22,763
Now get in. We're gonna be late.

3
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:28,079
No denying. The girl's got growl.
But can she get down like this?

4
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:31,116
Can you get down like this?
Bring it here. Bring it.

5
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:33,807
Then bring it right back, huh?
Look at that. Look at that.

6
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:49,640
Here it comes.

7
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:36,155
Hey, Gordy.

8
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:39,079
Morning, Beth.

9
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:51,879
Welcome to Timberline's
Wilderness Extravaganza.

10
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,804
l'm Ranger Beth.

11
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:57,287
Please, put your hands together
for Boog.

12
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:01,202
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

13
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:16,523
You can say l'm in love
You could say l'm insane

14
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:20,845
But no one understands me
Like my darling Lorraine

15
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:31,842
Looks like you're going
from one grill to another.

16
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:37,287
We rocked that house,
didn't we, Boog?

17
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:40,843
They were eating out of our hands.
Well, my hands, your paws.

18
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,118
Eating out of your paw.

19
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:48,486
That's good.
That's going in the show.

20
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:53,525
Shaw.
That guy really chaps my khakis.

21
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:54,921
You wait here, Boog.

22
00:03:57,527 --> 00:04:00,121
-Cuff him, Gordy.
-Oh, the Girl Scouts are here.

23
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:01,600
He's at it again.

24
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:05,517
Shaw, hunting season doesn't start
forthree days.

25
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:07,763
What are you doing
with that buck on your hood?

26
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:12,244
What? lt ain't my fault.
He ran right in front of my truck.

27
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:14,562
Where, on the interstate?

28
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:20,086
Sort of.

29
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:24,645
Where is that girl?

30
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:37,079
That's nasty.

31
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:48,085
What? What the--?
What's going on? Where am l?

32
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:51,722
l saw a bright light and--
l saw two bright lights and....

33
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:53,758
-Am l dead?
-Not yet.

34
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:56,598
But seeing how
that is Shaw's truck--

35
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:59,525
-What's a Shaw?
-Only the nastiest hunter in town.

36
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,161
A hunter? Did he get you too?

37
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,644
You don't see me tied up,
do you, baby?

38
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:07,161
-This is my ride.
-Your ride?

39
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:08,959
Yeah, this is my town, okay?

40
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,607
These are my people.
This is where l reside.

41
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,800
Nobody's hunting this bear.

42
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:21,922
Really? Well, then untie me.
Please? Look, no one's looking.

43
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:24,322
-Ain't gonna be able to do it.
-What am l gonna do?

44
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,483
l don't wanna be mounted on a wall.

45
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:29,075
-Calm down. Ain't gonna happen.
-lt's not?

46
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:32,279
-Not with that rack.
-l don't have a problem with--

47
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:35,838
My.... lt's....

48
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:40,440
l'm a unihorn. Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.

49
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,842
l'm hideous. l'm a monster.

50
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:46,797
-Tree-hugger.
-Knuckle dragger.

51
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:48,076
Veggieburger.

52
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,163
All right, all right.
That's enough, you two.

53
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,715
Listen, Girl Scout,
they're dumb animals.

54
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:57,796
l'm just respecting the natural order:
man on top, animals on the bottom.

55
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:01,717
But your bear--
Now, now, your bear is special.

56
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:04,600
He belongs somewhere
in the middle.

57
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:08,475
Between two slices of rye,
smothered in gravy.

58
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:12,403
You're a sick, sick,
twisted puppy, Shaw.

59
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:17,403
Put me down for a box of Thin Mints,
will you, sweetie?

60
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:23,886
Six-toed gun monkey.
Boog, come on, let's get out of here.

61
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:28,438
Come on, l'm begging you.
Please, please. Just untie me.

62
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,637
Come on. Please, please, please?

63
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:38,677
Hey, go on now. Scamper on
back to the woods, little buddy.

64
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:43,484
Little one-horned freak.

65
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:47,204
Buddy? He called me ''buddy.''

66
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:51,635
My buck.

67
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,085
My truck. Why, you little--

68
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,516
Shaw, no shooting in town.

69
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:02,720
But, Gordy, that bear leaned over
and untied my buck.

70
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:07,279
-Didn't you see that?
-All l see is a busted headlight.

71
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:11,878
Shaw, you've been living
in the woods too long.

72
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:19,680
They can't tell me what l seen,
because only l know what l seen.

73
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:25,079
Wheel of Fortune!

74
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:30,479
Big money got to come. Come on.

75
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,522
-Okay, buddy, time for bed.
-Five hundred--

76
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:35,885
-There's no R--
-Boog.

77
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,518
Mr. Dinkleman's waiting.

78
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,525
Good night, big guy.

79
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,836
Oh, did l forget something?

80
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:05,320
No, no, no. No more treats for you.

81
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,564
No, stop it.

82
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,359
Not the face.
Oh, no, not the eyebrows too.

83
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:15,399
No, it's not gonna work this time.
Stop it. l'm serious, Boog.

84
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,439
lt's cute, but no-- All right.

85
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:27,363
lf you go out in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise

86
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:32,282
lf you go out in the woods today
You'd better go in disguise

87
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:34,841
For every bear
That everthere was

88
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:37,521
Will gatherthere together because

89
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,160
Today's the day

90
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:46,238
The teddy bears have their picnic

91
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,643
Good night, Boog.

92
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,281
Who's there?

93
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:04,719
l'm warning you. l got ten claws
and l ain't afraid to use them.

94
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:08,681
-Hey, buddy. lt's me, Elliot.
-What are you doing here?

95
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,081
You helped me,
l'm returning the favour.

96
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:13,324
l'm busting you out of here.
Let's go. Let's do this.

97
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:16,201
Come on. Let's book it before
the warden makes her rounds.

98
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:19,041
No, cornflake.
You've got it all twisted.

99
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:23,803
-This here is my home.
-Sweet.

100
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:26,198
Now haul your little butt
back out that window.

101
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:28,478
-What's this?
-Get off of that.

102
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,445
So soft. What is that?

103
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,325
What are you doing in there?

104
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:38,399
This place is big enough fortwo.

105
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,165
-What?
-Wow, look at that.

106
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:41,925
Does this look natural?

107
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:46,082
-Give me that.
-Oh, who's this little guy?

108
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:47,640
-Dinkleman.
-Dinkleman?

109
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,877
ls Dinkleman your doll?

110
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,603
l don't care about that old thing.

111
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:00,807
Oh, l get it. You're like a pet.

112
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,885
-l ain't nobody's pet.
-Right.

113
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:08,560
l do what l want, when l want,
and l come and go as l please.

114
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,957
Well, then let's go.

115
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:13,922
Outside?

116
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:18,560
Why would l wanna go outside
when l got all l need in....

117
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:22,404
Whoa, what's that?

118
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:24,961
l call them Woo Hoos, like:

119
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,195
You want one?

120
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,478
l know where there's a bunch of them,
but you gotta go...

121
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:33,479
...outside.

122
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:38,678
lnside. Outside.

123
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,156
-lnside. Outside.
-Stop it.

124
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:45,366
-Stupid nose.
-lnside. Outsi--

125
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:00,885
Okay, l got that Woo Hoo right out of
one of those container doohickeys.

126
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,520
You got that out the garbage?

127
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,241
l had that in my mouth
and everything.

128
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:09,242
Dude, you're freaking me out
with that nose thing.

129
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,480
-Whoa.
-What is it?

130
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,758
-lt's a whole Woo Hoo village.
-Sweet.

131
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,487
lt's locked. Maybe we should
come back tomorrow.

132
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:23,756
Hey.

133
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:28,519
Elliot, look what you.... You did.

134
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:30,957
You gonna get us in some trouble.

135
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:35,724
The Woo Hoo bar.

136
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:38,680
She's my lady. Smooth and creamy.

137
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,475
So bad, l shouldn't. Yet l will.

138
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,805
What is that?

139
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:55,083
Whoa, let me try.

140
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:01,606
Boog. Boog?

141
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:06,044
-Hello, idiot.
-lt's ''Elliot.''

142
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:31,082
l come in peace.

143
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,282
l'm foraging.

144
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,603
Pepperoni!

145
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:12,884
-All right. Yeah, there it is. Let's go.
-Boog, party's over, let's go.

146
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:19,245
-All right, yeah, there it is.
-Freeze.

147
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:26,600
Behold, the mighty grizzly.
Good night.

148
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:45,440
lf you go out in the woods today
There's gonna be some fries

149
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:50,765
Yeah, and the giraffes...

150
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,964
...they taste almost exactly
like the elephants.

151
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:56,125
That's messed up.

152
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,285
Hey, Gordy.

153
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:04,156
Back up quick, before she sees me.

154
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,283
You're in big trouble, mister.

155
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:19,157
You know what sugar does
to you, Boog.

156
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:21,884
Straight to bed, now!

157
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:28,283
l'm so sorry. lt's my fault.
lt won't happen again.

158
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,597
-What if he had hurt someone?
-Gordy, please.

159
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:34,481
-We're talking about Boog here.
-Hey, what are you looking at?

160
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,842
l told you not to wait up.

161
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:40,682
-l'll take him back to the woods.
-lt's time to put him where he belongs.

162
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:44,436
No, no, he's not ready to go back yet.
l mean, it's not my fault.

163
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,364
l tried to teach him the basics.

164
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:50,486
l took him fishing,
but he didn't wanna get wet.

165
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,926
Gordy, please--

166
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:00,081
Boog is sorry.

167
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:03,918
-Beth, you're not his mother.
-l'm not mothering him.

168
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:10,323
Excuse me. Go to bed, Boog!

169
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:16,806
One more summer.

170
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:19,282
That's all l'm asking,
one summer.

171
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:22,522
Great, see? l can be reasonable.
Thanks.

172
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:23,966
You know something?

173
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:28,805
The longer you wait, the harder
it's gonna be for him to adapt.

174
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:33,286
Oh, l'm sure he'll....
At least l think he'll--

175
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:36,837
And the harder it's gonna be
for you to let him go.

176
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:42,365
Good night, Beth.

177
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:05,437
What am l gonna do with you?

178
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:21,399
This isn't decaf. You know
what caffeine does to me, Bob.

179
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,483
l'd be talking up a storm,
chatting your ear off...

180
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,723
...a mile a minute
forthe whole ride.

181
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:31,842
Mr. Weenie, heel. Heel, Mr. Weenie.

182
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,800
Hot.

183
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:42,564
lt's terrible but wonderful
at the same time.

184
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,359
lt's like freedom in a cup.

185
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,197
Out of hand.

186
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,443
You know, l heard Boog got loose
last night...

187
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,966
...and he totally trashed the place.

188
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,805
-Really?
-That's what happened.

189
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,395
There's something wrong
going on here.

190
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:11,326
You? lt walks like a man.

191
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:21,801
Hold still,
you two-legged latte drinker.

192
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:23,076
Look out!

193
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:29,281
Not again.

194
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:32,684
Boog will have you eating out
of his paw.

195
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:36,519
Get it?
''Paw,'' because he's a bear?

196
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:41,200
-So anyway....
-Oh, man.

197
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,285
Okay, relax, Boog.
You can do this.

198
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,286
-What the--?
-l gotta hide. l gotta hide.

199
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:52,201
What are you doing?
Get out of here. Hey.

200
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:54,204
He's right behind me.

201
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,806
l knew it.
That bear's corrupted my buck.

202
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,000
Hide me.

203
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,560
-All right, he's gone. Now get out.
-Good idea.

204
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:13,759
-Where you going?
-Behold, the mighty grizzly.

205
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:21,116
How cute, a donkey.

206
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:27,242
-You got me in enough trouble.
-Hey, l-- You saved my life.

207
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,483
That means
that you're responsible for me.

208
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,484
What? Stop messing up my life.

209
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,802
You needed to get out.
You should thank me.

210
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:35,923
-Thank you?
-You're welcome, buddy.

211
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,716
Stop calling me that. Now get out.

212
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:40,644
Need to hide. Need to hide.

213
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,515
Boog?

214
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,998
Oh, no, you don't.
You're leaving now.

215
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:47,277
-Out of the coat. Take it off.
-No. No!

216
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,039
-Take off the coat.
-No means no.

217
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:53,480
-He's eating the donkey.
-He's gonna eat us all.

218
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,120
You know he's still out there.

219
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:59,079
Eat you? He's not gonna--
Boog, what are you doing?

220
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,845
Put that animal down this instant.

221
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,967
-Hold still.
-No, l'm staying.

222
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:04,997
But my show!

223
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:07,198
Sit, Boog. You're getting a time-out.

224
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:09,363
Do you hear me?
l'm totally getting angry.

225
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:11,443
That guy wants to kill me.

226
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,525
No, wait.

227
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,318
-l chipped a hoof.
-Chipped a--?

228
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,483
You chipped a-- l'm gonna kill you.

229
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:26,719
He's harmless. Really.
Stay calm. Stay calm!

230
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:28,366
Out of my way. Move.

231
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:31,126
Show's over,
you four-legged freaks of nature.

232
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,599
Perfect.

233
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,878
Shaw. Drop that gun.

234
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:44,840
You're ruining my show.

235
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:47,766
Easy, now. Just line them up.

236
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:51,084
Two heads, one bullet.

237
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:59,201
Buttermilk biscuits.

238
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:15,281
Shaw, you're under arrest.

239
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:18,125
Shaw?

240
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:27,638
Gordy, l didn't know
what else to do. l--

241
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,604
lt's time, Beth.

242
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,203
But what about hunting season?

243
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:35,444
Take him above the falls.
He'll be safe there.

244
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:12,879
You're gonna be....

245
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,003
You're gonna be fine.

246
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:21,843
l'm gonna miss you, big guy.

247
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,364
Pretty.

248
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:18,685
Where's home? lt's gone.

249
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:20,765
Someone stole it.

250
00:23:21,887 --> 00:23:24,560
Hey, could you keep it down?

251
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:27,163
l'm trying to sleep here.

252
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:31,516
You.

253
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:34,396
-No, l didn't do it.
-Take a good look, Elliot.

254
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:36,518
What do you see, Elliot?
Something's missing, Elliot.

255
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,399
What is it, Elliot? What is it?

256
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:40,443
Wait, don't tell me. l....

257
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:41,761
Timberline is missing!

258
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:44,805
-l was just gonna say that.
-My garage is missing.

259
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:47,043
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner
are missing.

260
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:51,917
My life is missing,
and it's all your fault.

261
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,725
What are you gonna do?

262
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:02,278
You're funny.

263
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,604
l thought, ''Maybe,'' but then
l was like...and then--

264
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:09,000
This ain't happening.
lt's some kind of mistake.

265
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:11,647
Think, Boog. She's mad,
but you can fix this.

266
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,962
All right, l'll go back
and l'll give herthe face.

267
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,486
The face.

268
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,884
Gotta get back before
she forgets the face.

269
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:21,601
That'll clear it all up right there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the face.

270
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:27,560
Boog!

271
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,965
You can't just go wandering
around out here.

272
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:32,884
You don't know where you're going,
Boog!

273
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,486
l'm going home.

274
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,518
Wait. Boog.

275
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,197
l know where Timberline is.

276
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:42,599
-l can get you back.
-Thank you, but no thank you.

277
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,241
Quiet.

278
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,924
Timberline's gotta be
around here somewhere.

279
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:55,525
Well, that was quick.

280
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:03,356
Now, let's see.
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

281
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:07,163
Boog, is that you?

282
00:25:22,527 --> 00:25:24,165
Boog.

283
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:36,519
Okay, l gotta get the lay of the land.

284
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:37,960
Somehow...

285
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:41,439
...if l get up high enough, then....

286
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:44,080
All right.

287
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:45,765
l can do this.

288
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:49,077
No problem.

289
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,596
Lost yourway to Sunday school, pal?

290
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:58,835
This is McSquizzy's turf.
Nobody messes with McSquizzy.

291
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:00,121
Because that's me.

292
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,683
-What?
-Touch a needle in this tree...

293
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,923
-...and l'll give you such a doing!
-Yeah?

294
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:08,083
You and what army?

295
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:11,521
Oh, that army.

296
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:13,677
Mess not with the furrytail clan.

297
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:17,077
Defenders of the good,
crusaders of the righteous...

298
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:19,880
...guardians of the pine.

299
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:23,679
Keep yourtree. l'll find another one.

300
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:28,077
Look! He's got a wee freakish twin
growing out of his back.

301
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:36,917
Oh, this one will work.

302
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:40,318
Hey. That was a warning, all right?

303
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:44,040
Try that again, and l'll be kicking
your furry brown bahookie!

304
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,203
What?
Hey, this is a different tree.

305
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:47,965
They're all my trees.

306
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:51,124
l suggest you turn round and head
right back from whence you came.

307
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:53,960
That's what l'm trying to do.
So just point me the way to town...

308
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:55,440
...and l'll be out of here.

309
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:03,004
That's it.
You're asking for a whooping.

310
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,035
Ready!

311
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,526
Fire!

312
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,961
Hey, Boog, look. No hands.

313
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,484
l think l'm getting a sunburn,
though.

314
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:15,199
Check it out.

315
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:18,486
All right, where's town?

316
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,320
Orwhat we would call this,
a moon burn.

317
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:25,606
Look, just give me the directions.

318
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:27,326
l really need to get back.

319
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:28,846
So sad.

320
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:31,800
-Where's Timberline?
-Okay. Okay. All right.

321
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:33,839
You got it good
in Timberline, right?

322
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:37,124
Coffee, Woo Hoo bars, safety.

323
00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:41,162
-Yeah, so?
-And still, something is missing.

324
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:43,005
-There is?
-Yep. Me.

325
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,845
And l want in, Boog.
l'll take you to town...

326
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:47,117
...but when we get there,
we're partners.

327
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:48,999
Deal, partner?

328
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:51,966
What? Oh, no, no, no.

329
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,157
That ain't never
gonna happen. Never.

330
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:56,204
Don't you have a herd
to get back to?

331
00:27:56,327 --> 00:28:00,206
What--? My herd?
They-- My herd will understand.

332
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,238
These guys are my--
They're my buddies.

333
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:04,961
-They-- They want the best for me.
-Forget it.

334
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,877
Oh, well.
Better start moving, then.

335
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:11,237
Because open season starts
in a few days.

336
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,517
Maybe one of those hunters
can give you a ride back...

337
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:15,842
...on the hood of theirtruck.

338
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,961
Hunters. Dang.

339
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:24,281
-Okay, okay.
-So we have a deal, then?

340
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:26,278
Okay, let me hear you say it.

341
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:32,762
-Partners?
-You're disgusting.

342
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:35,242
-What was that?
-l....

343
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:37,757
-Sorry, can't hear you.
-l said, l guess...

344
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:40,447
...we can be partners.

345
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,956
Partners?

346
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:48,518
Partners.

347
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:51,286
Okey-dokey, this way!
Move it or lose it!

348
00:28:51,407 --> 00:28:53,523
You know, we should have
a secret handshake...

349
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,440
...and like nicknames and stuff.
Like, cool nicknames, though.

350
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,437
l'll call you Boogster...

351
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:59,683
...and then you can call me
The lncredible Mister E.

352
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,321
lsn't that great?
l came up with that myself.

353
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,477
l made that up. You know,
this is gonna be awesome.

354
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:06,159
lt's just you and me.

355
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,158
Hey, who's the lady in the shorts?

356
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,999
l hope l'm not too late.

357
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:25,764
They've been out here all night.

358
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,435
A bear...

359
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,762
...and a deer, working together.

360
00:29:31,127 --> 00:29:33,163
How far does this conspiracy go?

361
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:35,887
What other animals are involved?
God bless America!

362
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,282
l hope the bald eagle hasn't turned.

363
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:40,885
No, no, no.

364
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:42,360
Maybe they're right.

365
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:46,602
Maybe.... Maybe old Shaw is crazy.

366
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,678
Yeah, maybe.

367
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:00,636
lsn't it peaceful out here, Bob?

368
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:04,326
You're right, Bob. Let's not spoil
the beauty of this moment...

369
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:05,886
...with idle chatter.

370
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:08,720
Some people can just jibber-jabber
till the cows come home.

371
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,685
What does that mean, Bob?
''Till the cows come home.''

372
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:14,123
Where have the cows been?

373
00:30:24,287 --> 00:30:26,755
Okay, Forest 101.

374
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:30,241
These big wood stick things
are called trees.

375
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:34,520
The big rocks are called mountains,
and the little rocks are their babies.

376
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:39,125
Altitude.

377
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:43,720
No jelly arm, no jelly arm. Come on.

378
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:47,999
-Elliot!
-Boogster, it's....

379
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:49,435
How many times must l say it?

380
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:51,996
l am the lncredible Mister E.

381
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:53,480
Elliot, please.

382
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:55,877
Look, if you don't use
the code names...

383
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:58,885
...how am l supposed to know that
it's really you that l'm talking to?

384
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,637
Yeah, yeah. Okay, l got it.

385
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:15,598
Nice and easy.

386
00:31:18,687 --> 00:31:21,201
Just rip it off fast, like a Band-Aid.

387
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:22,885
Hold still, okay?

388
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,123
Just be calm.
This might pinch a little.

389
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:29,278
-Get it overwith.
-You may wanna cover your ears.

390
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:31,398
Cover my--?

391
00:31:33,047 --> 00:31:36,483
Okay, scamper on back
to the woods, little buddy.

392
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:40,766
Buddy.

393
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:43,600
Okay, ladies, this dam
ain't gonna build itself!

394
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:46,281
Lift that birch.
Swing those pines over here.

395
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:47,760
Come on. Move it!

396
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,401
Yo, O'Toole!

397
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:51,677
-Yeah, boss?
-l want you to cantileverthat cedar...

398
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:54,565
...on the bias down by the north end,
you got that?

399
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:58,285
Put a twig in the hole.

400
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:00,126
Rookie.

401
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:03,202
Take five for lunch!

402
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:06,357
-What do you got?
-Wood.

403
00:32:06,487 --> 00:32:08,478
-What do you got?
-Wood.

404
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,519
You wanna trade?

405
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:13,880
Hey, hey, guys. Check it out.

406
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:16,840
There goes the largest carnivore
in North America.

407
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:20,755
-The mighty grizzly.
-And he's a good dancer.

408
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:22,479
We're gonna be in a show.

409
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:27,082
Come here!

410
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:30,117
Hey, that's my good antler.

411
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:33,241
Listen, simple. We are not ''we.''

412
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,200
lt's just me.
And we ain't doing no show.

413
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:38,080
-Diva.
-What?

414
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,765
l understand what's going on here.

415
00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:41,803
You're a little crabby
because you're hungry.

416
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,645
l, l....

417
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:46,600
l think yes.

418
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:50,322
l'm starving!

419
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:52,921
-Here, try this.
-l can't eat that.

420
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:54,560
Picky, picky, picky.

421
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:55,961
Well, what do bears eat?

422
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:02,324
Fish. Bears eat fish.

423
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,718
All right, fishies, give it up for Boog!

424
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:26,918
Hey, lncredible Mister E.

425
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,197
Yes, Boogster?

426
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:33,076
-l gotta go.
-Well, go.

427
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:35,522
No, l need a toilet.

428
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:38,357
You know, the think tank.

429
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:42,886
The log cabin, the johnny
on the spot, the oval office.

430
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:45,567
-There's none of those things out here.
-Well, what do you do?

431
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,076
You know...

432
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,637
...l can't remember. But listen.

433
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:56,564
Don't look now, but l see a little bush
with your name written all over it.

434
00:33:56,687 --> 00:33:58,245
A bush? Are you serious?

435
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:00,363
Go on. lt's just like riding a bicycle.

436
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:02,478
Only you're crapping on it.

437
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:06,675
Show us your ''grr'' face, nature boy.

438
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:22,602
Hey. What are you doing here?

439
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,155
Get out of here.

440
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:27,280
l'm working here. Now, go.

441
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:30,316
All right, all right,
you've had your fun.

442
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:32,443
Nothing to see here.
Let the bear do his thing.

443
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:35,755
You believe those guys?

444
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:39,519
Finished?

445
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:41,917
l bet my nuts
that big hairy choob can't do it.

446
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:45,198
-l'll take a piece of that action.
-What is wrong with you animals?

447
00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:46,885
Perhaps some roughage, buddy?

448
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:47,883
Buddy.

449
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:49,122
Perhaps some privacy.

450
00:34:49,247 --> 00:34:51,556
-What are you doing on my house?
-This is your house?

451
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:53,086
Oh, l-- l didn't know....

452
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:55,886
-lt would be an improvement.
-What did you just say, Rosie?

453
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:57,725
Nothing. Why you gotta
be so sensitive?

454
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,566
-Boogster, what's the deal?
-You watch your mouth...

455
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:02,365
...or you'll get yourself in trouble.

456
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:04,364
You're just jealous
because you ain't got a man.

457
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,324
l don't know.
Some kind of chick fight.

458
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:08,275
Elliot, what do l do?

459
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,796
Well, that's easy.
You just gotta mark yourterritory.

460
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:13,606
-Show them who's boss.
-All right, ladies.

461
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:15,564
l'm laying down the law.

462
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,119
Unless, of course, they're skunks.

463
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:21,525
Disgusting.

464
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:29,040
Giselle.

465
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,844
Ridiculous.

466
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:38,764
The woods is no place for a bear.

467
00:35:39,647 --> 00:35:40,921
Ducks? Okay.

468
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:42,925
Look, don't move.

469
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:47,035
Oh, yeah. Sprucing up.

470
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:50,242
Quick. You guys gotta help me.

471
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:54,439
Don't mind Deni, monsieur.
He's a bit nervous.

472
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:55,966
Never been quite...

473
00:35:56,727 --> 00:36:00,640
...right since the great migration.

474
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:05,440
There were thousands of us
when we started in the big V's.

475
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:09,964
Then.... Then it happened.

476
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,361
What happened?

477
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:14,880
What happened?
Open season happened.

478
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,923
Just me and Deni were left.

479
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:21,556
How can you make a V
with only two duck, you ask, eh?

480
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,837
Well, you cannot, monsieur.

481
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,878
lt's a tragedy!

482
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:29,397
Yeah, right, whatever.

483
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:32,201
But check this out.
l'm looking fortown.

484
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:35,279
Okay? Now, could one of you guys
fly up there...

485
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:38,319
-...and show me the way?
-Fly? Fly?

486
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,955
Quiet. They'll hear you.

487
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,242
Giselle.

488
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:45,637
-Elliot?
-Hey, gorgeous.

489
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:48,440
-How you doing?
-Elliot, where have you been?

490
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:50,797
Oh, you know. Big city.

491
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:54,596
Kind of a road trip. Saw the sights,
hit the buffet, took in a show.

492
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:56,080
Things are looking up, Giselle.

493
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:58,437
Really? l heard
you got hit by a truck.

494
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,246
That-- Rumour.

495
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:04,483
You better get out of here.
Rememberwhat happened...

496
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:07,365
-...last time you talked to me?
-ls lan around?

497
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,364
How long have you had that tic?

498
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:14,724
l think it's getting worse.

499
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:17,479
Oh, crud.

500
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:23,801
Hello, ''Smelliot.''

501
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:27,521
l called him Smelliot.

502
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:31,075
Herd! Circle formation!

503
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:34,878
You pinheads. That's an oval.

504
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,555
More circle-y!

505
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:40,477
You got a lot of nerve
coming back here.

506
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:43,644
-Why, thank you.
-That was not a compliment, maggot!

507
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:45,962
Well, he was just going.
Right, Elliot?

508
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:47,275
Yeah, lan.

509
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:50,763
l had to stop by and say hello
to some of my old pals.

510
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:52,838
Bob, Kevin. Jurgen,
how's the knee?

511
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:57,000
l told you to leave the herd
and never, ever, ever....

512
00:37:57,127 --> 00:38:00,836
-Never?
-Never, ever, ever come back.

513
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:01,877
Back?

514
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,478
l'm not-- l'm not back.

515
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:07,516
Me and my best buddy
are heading to town.

516
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:10,838
Yeah. l sure am gonna miss
you guys.

517
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:12,605
Off the upholstery!

518
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:14,606
What now?

519
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:24,961
So as l was saying,
never, ever, ever--

520
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:28,436
A bear! Bear. Bear. A bear.

521
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:31,606
Elliot, are you all right?

522
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,638
Buttermilk biscuit.

523
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:36,564
Hey, lan. Get a load of this.

524
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:38,519
Hey, cut it out.

525
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:40,837
Oh, l've heard of you.

526
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:45,085
You're that bearthat got
his butt thumped by a squirrel.

527
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:48,397
lt was-- There was 20 of them.

528
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,636
And they had nuts.

529
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:54,404
Don't listen to him, Boog.

530
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:56,757
Boog? What is that short for?

531
00:38:57,287 --> 00:38:59,198
-Booger?
-Booger!

532
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:01,887
-Listen, you!
-l'm all ears.

533
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:05,606
-Well....
-Boog, let's go.

534
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:09,516
You two are perfect for each other.

535
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:13,083
You're a loser and you're a loser-er.

536
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:15,839
Herd, let's bound!

537
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:18,846
Hey, Elliot.

538
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:20,964
l think you lost something.

539
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:24,760
Maybe it'll grow back. Bye, Elliot.

540
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,286
Yeah, see you.

541
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:30,123
See you later, backpack boy!

542
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:35,038
That's right, fool. You better run.

543
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,522
Keep on prancing,
you panty-waisted cow.

544
00:39:37,647 --> 00:39:40,161
Yeah. One more word,
and l was gonna rack him.

545
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:41,595
-That's right.
-l was waiting for it.

546
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:42,796
He's scared. He's scared.

547
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,003
-Look at him run. Look at him run.
-Yeah, l know it.

548
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:46,480
Look at him go.

549
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:49,196
Are you not gonna buy him a drink
before you kiss him?

550
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:51,238
You big jessie.

551
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:57,079
On your bikes,
you big numpties.

552
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:31,363
That was lan's girl
you was trying to talk to, huh?

553
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:35,200
You dog.

554
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:40,001
lan's right. l'm a loser.

555
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:41,839
-No, you're not a loser.
-Yes, l am.

556
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:43,440
-No, you're not.
-Yes.

557
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:47,276
Trust me. You know the day l met you,
lan kicked me out of the herd.

558
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:50,956
l lost my antler, l got run over
and tied to the hood of a truck.

559
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,686
What do you call that?

560
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,881
A loser. But check this out.

561
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,761
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

562
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:01,316
l look like a bear, l talk like a bear.

563
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:04,962
But l can't fish, l can't climb a tree,
l can't even go in the woods.

564
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:08,602
That's nothing. Half doe.
Half buck. l'm a duck.

565
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:10,279
Hey, l ride a unicycle for crackers!

566
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:12,602
-l have a glass eye.
-l can't snap.

567
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:15,685
-l thought ''log'' was a colour.
-l can't see my feet.

568
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,325
l killed a man.

569
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:29,757
Well, at least you've got a home.

570
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,043
Home. Yeah.

571
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,124
l sure hope so.

572
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:38,805
-Crimenently! Was that your neck?
-No.

573
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:43,925
My fishy crackers.
Oh, she still loves me.

574
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:45,366
Thank you, Beth.

575
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:47,365
l'm coming home.

576
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:51,677
Try one, partner. Yeah.

577
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:54,367
Woo Hoo bars they ain't,
but they take you back.

578
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:56,125
You know? Remind you of home.

579
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,044
Sweet, salty home.

580
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:06,040
Oh, yeah. To be back
in my own soft bed.

581
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:10,682
Eight square meals a day,
plus snacks.

582
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,522
Beth tucking me in every night.

583
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:15,559
lt's like heaven to me.

584
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:22,797
You know,
when we get back home tomorrow...

585
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,475
...l'm gonna make things right
with Beth.

586
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:29,596
And maybe, just maybe...

587
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,520
...we'll find a place
for you in the garage with me.

588
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:37,044
Sweet! Oh, yeah. l'm in the garage.

589
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,805
Who's staying in the garage?
l'm in the garage.

590
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:41,560
Who's got a place in the garage?
lt's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah--

591
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,518
-Hey, buddy?
-Yeah?

592
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:47,925
Do me a favour, will you?
lt's gonna sound silly, but will you--?

593
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,966
-Forget it.
-What?

594
00:42:50,087 --> 00:42:51,839
Come on. l'm here for you.

595
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:55,803
Will you sing me
that ''teddy-bear picnic'' song?

596
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:58,925
Absolutely. The what song?

597
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:02,517
Well, Beth always sings it to me,
you know, because it helps me sleep.

598
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,844
-Okay. l'll give it a shot.
-Thanks.

599
00:43:07,447 --> 00:43:11,884
Once there was a magical elf
Who lived in a rainbow tree

600
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,237
He lived downstairs
From a flatulent dwarf

601
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:16,443
Who was constantly having to pee

602
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,041
One day the elf could take no more

603
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,522
So he went and banged
On the rude dwarf's door

604
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:27,080
And what do you know
They suddenly both were married

605
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,719
Good night, Boog.

606
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:39,320
l'm sleeping in the garage.
l'm sleeping in the garage.

607
00:43:43,727 --> 00:43:47,640
Come on, Mr. Weenie.
Beg. You can do it.

608
00:43:47,727 --> 00:43:49,797
Come on. Beg.

609
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:53,284
Bob, he won't listen.
Bob, show him how to beg.

610
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,519
Dog worship.

611
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,282
Oh, my!

612
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,246
-You folks all right?
-What? No, no, no! He's--

613
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:13,880
Taken you hostage. l know, l know.

614
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:16,162
You're safe now.
l've got the enemy neutral--

615
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,919
There, there, Mr. Weenie.
Are you all right, baby?

616
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:24,240
You're the sweetest
little weenie l ever saw.

617
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:29,636
Don't be fooled. He's one of them.

618
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:33,124
-Who?
-The enemy! The bear! That deer!

619
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:34,805
All them animals!

620
00:44:34,927 --> 00:44:37,316
l have seen the future.

621
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:41,322
lt will start in small towns
like Timberline.

622
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:45,118
Soon, it'll spread.

623
00:44:46,327 --> 00:44:51,117
They will invade from burrows,
caves, petting zoos.

624
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:55,644
lf l don't stop them...

625
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:59,766
...it'll be a total reversal
of the natural order.

626
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:04,439
They laugh at old Shaw,
but you'll see.

627
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:08,762
The truth will be revealed.

628
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,683
We know exactly what you mean.

629
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:14,959
-You do?
-We're scientists. Well, of sorts.

630
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,885
And we're trying to secure
photographic documentation...

631
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,919
...of a real, live homo-sasquatchus.

632
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:24,124
-Homo-say-what?
-We're looking for Bigfoot.

633
00:45:25,047 --> 00:45:30,201
Bigfoot--? l didn't realise
l was talking to a couple of wack jobs.

634
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:35,877
Don't trust him.
Pets are double agents.

635
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:39,682
The moment you turn your back,
he'll shiv you!

636
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:45,158
Oh, no, he can't. We had him fixed.

637
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:48,239
Boog?

638
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:52,396
Boog. Are you awake?

639
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:55,360
-l am now.
-Awesome.

640
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:59,844
l was watching you sleep last night
and you were like a little angel.

641
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:02,356
Except for you're fat
and snoring like:

642
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:08,286
We're gonna work on that, though.

643
00:46:08,407 --> 00:46:10,716
l invented this cure
where you stick yourwhole hand...

644
00:46:10,847 --> 00:46:13,600
-...in your mouth.
-How long before we get to Timberline?

645
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:17,045
Oh, by nightfall. Easy.

646
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,361
Are you sure?

647
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:20,165
Absolutely.

648
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:22,761
Hey, you wanna see
something stupid?

649
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,238
Well, then we better get going.

650
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:31,317
Right. We're on a tight schedule.
l'll carry your load.

651
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:32,846
Oh, no. Whoa, wait.

652
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:36,443
Look, you gotta be real careful with
him, okay, because he's real delicate.

653
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:40,845
Want a fishy cracker?

654
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,925
No. l'll eat when l get home.

655
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:48,916
Listen, girlfriend.

656
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:52,357
You wanna find a man like my lgnacio,
you gotta check your look.

657
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:54,796
What are you saying? l'm black
and white. l go with everything.

658
00:46:54,927 --> 00:46:56,360
You go fine with everybody.
Maybe that's your problem.

659
00:46:56,487 --> 00:46:59,718
-Ain't those the same two skunks--
-l had some thoughts on the show.

660
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,276
-My show?
-The lady in the shorts has gotta go.

661
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:06,246
She's slowing us down. lt's gotta
be fresh, new. l want some jazz.

662
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:09,281
l'm the star, and the people out there
come to see me...

663
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:11,921
...a grizzly bear.

664
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,400
l see.

665
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:18,726
You get to have the careerwhile
l stay home and look after Dinkleman!

666
00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:20,485
He's not even mine!

667
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:24,557
l don't get to have a dream.
ls that it?

668
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:28,078
Buddy.

669
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:32,880
Don't you think
l might like a little singing...

670
00:47:33,047 --> 00:47:35,641
-...a little dancing, a little:
-Elliot.

671
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:39,646
But no. All l ever hear is, ''How long
until we get to Timberline, simple?

672
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:42,600
-How long until we get home?''
-Elliot! Are those the same beavers?

673
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:47,039
-No. All beavers look alike.
-Hey! Tiny dancer!

674
00:47:47,887 --> 00:47:50,162
Yeah, that's right! Shake it, shake it!

675
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,842
-Let's see some moves!
-Elliot!

676
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,883
Yeah.

677
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:57,995
Elliot, this is the same dang dam.
We've been going in circles!

678
00:47:58,367 --> 00:48:01,325
Circle. One time around.

679
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:04,126
You don't even know
where we're going.

680
00:48:06,407 --> 00:48:07,920
Got them, Lorraine!

681
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:18,486
-What was that?
-Hunters?

682
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,883
-What are they doing up here?
-Okay, boys. Take cover!

683
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:27,887
-Boog, we gotta hide.
-l'm out of here.

684
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:30,083
Boog, wait! Don't go out there!

685
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:35,281
Hey, tubby, stop! Hey,
this ain't a load-bearing structure!

686
00:48:40,967 --> 00:48:42,446
Oh, that's bad.

687
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:47,720
Rosie, in here.

688
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:06,164
-Stop. Get off.
-Buddy, buddy, buddy!

689
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:07,886
Crud.

690
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,323
Shaw!

691
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:28,244
Dinkleman!

692
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,565
You're gonna be okay!

693
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:35,962
We're gonna die and you know it.

694
00:49:40,807 --> 00:49:43,640
No one around here
to save you this time, boys!

695
00:49:44,287 --> 00:49:46,755
Paddle, Boog! Paddle!

696
00:49:48,967 --> 00:49:52,118
Grab a boulder! Grab a boulder!

697
00:49:52,287 --> 00:49:54,323
Left, left. Right!

698
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:56,883
Oh, like you know.

699
00:50:02,807 --> 00:50:03,842
Where is he?

700
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,681
He's gone. Oh, there he is.

701
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:10,004
No, wait. There he is. There he is.

702
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:11,846
-Why, you little--
-There he is.

703
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:13,963
Quiet, l'm trying to drive.

704
00:50:19,287 --> 00:50:21,039
Faster, Boog!

705
00:50:21,527 --> 00:50:25,156
Like fishing and hunting
at the same time.

706
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:41,085
-Give me a hand, Boog! Hold me!
-Stop. Get off! Elliot, get off. Get off!

707
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:42,799
Stop!

708
00:51:24,447 --> 00:51:26,005
Dinkleman?

709
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:45,162
You. You did this.

710
00:51:45,327 --> 00:51:47,557
-Yeah, that's right.
-What did l do?

711
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,484
You dragged us down
to the hunting grounds.

712
00:51:49,647 --> 00:51:52,764
-Yeah, where are we gonna hide?
-We're sitting ducks out here.

713
00:51:52,927 --> 00:51:54,360
And it's open season!

714
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:57,126
All right, all right. That's enough.

715
00:51:57,527 --> 00:51:59,006
Guys, it's not his fault.

716
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:01,436
Oh, you're right, Elliot. lt's your fault.

717
00:52:01,687 --> 00:52:03,245
-My fault?
-Yeah.

718
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:05,244
lf it weren't for you
l'd be home right now.

719
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:06,766
None of this
would've ever happened.

720
00:52:06,887 --> 00:52:09,720
You said you knew the way back,
but you lied.

721
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:12,396
l-- No.

722
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:14,796
Okay.

723
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:16,759
Okay, maybe--

724
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:20,239
l thought if you hung out with me
then maybe you would like me.

725
00:52:20,327 --> 00:52:23,524
Oh, man. l trusted you, Elliot.

726
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:25,365
l'm sorry, Boog.

727
00:52:26,127 --> 00:52:27,924
We're still partners, right?

728
00:52:28,207 --> 00:52:30,596
You know, Elliot, l'm better off alone.

729
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:33,960
What about us?

730
00:52:34,127 --> 00:52:35,640
-Yeah.
-Yeah, what about us?

731
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:38,235
Us? There's no us.

732
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:41,684
You're not my problem.
And you? We're done.

733
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:44,924
-But-- Boog, wait.
-Done.

734
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:11,401
-Oh, no.
-Thanks forthe licence, Gordy.

735
00:54:11,607 --> 00:54:13,086
All right, guys. Good luck.

736
00:54:13,207 --> 00:54:18,235
-Hey, Earl. That a new truck?
-Yeah. Check it out. Jealous much?

737
00:54:19,127 --> 00:54:20,276
You okay?

738
00:54:20,487 --> 00:54:22,443
l put him way above the falls.

739
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:25,404
l hope l did the right thing.

740
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:29,276
Don't worry, Beth. l'm sure Boog
is happy in his new home.

741
00:54:32,247 --> 00:54:34,238
Stupid nature.

742
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,084
Civilisation.

743
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:44,526
Hello?

744
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:47,999
Excuse me. ls anybody home?

745
00:54:54,767 --> 00:54:57,361
Oh, sweet porcelain.

746
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:08,925
And the crowd goes wild!

747
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,719
Now, there's gotta be
a fridge in here somewhere.

748
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:07,961
Oh, no.

749
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:12,639
Deers, skunks, beavers.

750
00:56:13,127 --> 00:56:14,924
l gotta hide.

751
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:20,160
That bear's turned them all.

752
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:35,638
Here you go, Lorraine.
There, you get good and dry.

753
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:39,123
Come morning,
we got a rebellion to crush.

754
00:56:39,847 --> 00:56:43,362
And then l'm gonna
take back what's mine!

755
00:56:43,527 --> 00:56:45,165
Elliot.

756
00:56:51,327 --> 00:56:53,716
Someone's been eating my candy.

757
00:56:59,447 --> 00:57:01,881
Somebody's been sitting in my chair.

758
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,686
Somebody forgot to flush!

759
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:17,284
And he's still here.

760
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:22,315
Come back for your bear,
Goldilocks?

761
00:57:28,247 --> 00:57:33,924
Ready or not, here l come!

762
00:57:39,087 --> 00:57:45,925
lf you go out in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise

763
00:57:46,807 --> 00:57:54,600
lf you go out in the woods today
You better go in disguise

764
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:57,998
'Cause every bear
That everthere was

765
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:03,806
Was gathered there
Together because

766
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:08,205
Today's the day
The teddy bears have

767
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:12,957
Their picnic!

768
00:58:38,087 --> 00:58:43,639
Hey, bear! There ain't nowhere
that you can hide from me!

769
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,044
As soon as l get mine:

770
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:53,640
Blowing their heads off!

771
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:56,520
Good time.

772
00:59:18,607 --> 00:59:20,438
Elliot.

773
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:33,637
No buddy.

774
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,885
Elliot, you've gotta hide.

775
00:59:51,367 --> 00:59:52,800
The hunters are here.

776
01:00:02,847 --> 01:00:05,486
He's gonna give us away.

777
01:00:08,287 --> 01:00:10,357
All right! Bring it! Bring it!

778
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,079
-Boog?
-Hey, buddy.

779
01:00:13,207 --> 01:00:14,560
What are you doing back here?

780
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:16,723
Come on. l couldn't go home
without my partner.

781
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:18,917
-l don't have a partner.
-Elliot.

782
01:00:19,047 --> 01:00:21,720
l don't need the herd
and l don't need you.

783
01:00:22,127 --> 01:00:23,480
So leave me alone.

784
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:26,678
Ain't gonna be able to do it.

785
01:00:26,807 --> 01:00:28,684
You see, l already saved you once.

786
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:32,038
That makes me responsible for you.

787
01:00:32,887 --> 01:00:36,084
l saw that. Come on.
Let me hear you say it. Partners.

788
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:38,039
-No.
-What was that?

789
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:41,516
-l guess we can be partners.
-Sorry, l can't hear you.

790
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:43,080
l said l guess we can be partners.

791
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:46,643
-Partners!
-Partners!

792
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:49,805
Okey-dokey. This way.

793
01:00:50,327 --> 01:00:53,399
-This way.
-Right. Maybe you better lead.

794
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,604
Yeah. Let's get back to the garage,
where it's safe.

795
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,237
-Safe?
-Safe?

796
01:01:01,967 --> 01:01:06,040
Hey, Boog. How many animals
can fit in the garage?

797
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:07,316
How many--?

798
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:09,086
Hello, Boog.

799
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:13,279
So where you all headed?

800
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:16,757
-To the safe place.
-This land of garage.

801
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,839
-With buddy.
-Come on. You owe us, Tiny.

802
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,446
-Yeah!
-Yeah! That's right!

803
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:24,884
Yeah, l'm sorry about the dam.

804
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:29,802
And how l messed you all up,
you know. My bad.

805
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:32,925
So you're taking us with you,
right, Booger?

806
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:36,445
Please? Please.

807
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:40,321
Look at me. l'm too pretty to die!

808
01:01:41,927 --> 01:01:43,997
Well, maybe....

809
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:47,080
No! No! No!

810
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:48,925
You ain't leaving without us.

811
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:50,799
l didn't mean to call you Booger.

812
01:01:50,927 --> 01:01:54,442
-Can we take Giselle?
-Wait! Let me think.

813
01:01:55,847 --> 01:01:57,724
Hunters.

814
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:01,676
Dang. Nobody's going home tonight.

815
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:03,399
There's so many of them.

816
01:02:03,527 --> 01:02:04,846
That's it, then.

817
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:07,403
No more me.

818
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:12,881
l guess l will be mounted on a wall.

819
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,438
Oh, no, you won't.

820
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:21,525
Now, when l'm a bearskin rug,
they can walk all over me.

821
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:24,759
But until that happens,
l ain't going out without a fight.

822
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:25,883
-What?
-Fight?

823
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:28,157
-The F word?
-That's right.

824
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,198
One thing you all have taught me...

825
01:02:30,327 --> 01:02:33,080
...the woods is a messed-up,
dangerous place.

826
01:02:34,647 --> 01:02:38,845
And y'all are crazy. You've been
kicking my butt forthe last two days.

827
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:40,237
Yeah, l kind of did.

828
01:02:40,327 --> 01:02:41,601
-l didn't.
-Sorry.

829
01:02:41,687 --> 01:02:44,076
So let's do to them
what you've been doing to me.

830
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:47,722
Now, l say we give our guests
the full outdoor experience.

831
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:48,802
Yeah!

832
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:52,955
Hey! ls this a private fight
or can anybody join?

833
01:02:53,127 --> 01:02:55,687
Because McSquizzy wants in.

834
01:02:56,047 --> 01:02:58,163
Good. Because we'll need your nuts.

835
01:02:58,287 --> 01:03:00,847
-And your acorns too.
-What's the plan, Boog?

836
01:03:00,967 --> 01:03:03,083
Oh, we gonna run
those yahoos back to town.

837
01:03:03,287 --> 01:03:07,405
Yeah, baby. When we get through
with them, they won't ever come back.

838
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:14,839
So you think you're so tough, huh?

839
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:18,724
Well, you know what l think?

840
01:03:19,247 --> 01:03:23,081
l think you're still
just a mama's bear.

841
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:34,602
You guard the fort, Mr. Weenie.
Mama's gonna take a dip.

842
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,045
That's good.
Mama's getting kind of gamey.

843
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:41,604
Come on, Bob. There's gonna be
a full moon out tonight.

844
01:03:48,807 --> 01:03:51,162
-Sorry.
-Come on. Let's go.

845
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,565
Boog?

846
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:06,365
Oh, yeah.

847
01:04:07,007 --> 01:04:09,760
-Maria, let go.
-l'll carry it.

848
01:04:10,607 --> 01:04:12,757
lt's empty.

849
01:04:13,207 --> 01:04:14,162
Ladies.

850
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:16,477
Heave-ho, heave-ho.

851
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:22,802
This is gonna be great.

852
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,557
You. We gonna need more ducks.

853
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:30,122
Elliot, is that chocolate on your face?

854
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:31,840
No.

855
01:04:33,447 --> 01:04:35,961
-lt's a pet.
-He's gonna blow our cover.

856
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:42,047
l've been living a lie!

857
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:45,966
Please, take me with you.

858
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:14,080
Hey, Boog. You're not still mad
about that backpack thing, are you?

859
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:18,036
Oh, no. l never hold a grudge.
l just let them go.

860
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:21,122
What was that?

861
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:25,000
lt's the signal.

862
01:05:29,007 --> 01:05:31,760
Okay, Deni. Let's round them up!

863

Good job, Reilly. All right.

867
01:05:57,327 --> 01:05:59,318
Time to run
these guys back to town.

868
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:01,961
Are you ready forthis?

869
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:06,319
-This is awkward.
-Yes. Yes, it is.

870
01:06:09,367 --> 01:06:11,597
-Can l?
-Go for it, Smelliot.

Now, let's kick

875
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:29,565
Bob, we've been robbed!

And they took Mr. Weenie!

877

How you doing, partner?

883

Boog, this is great.
Let's do this every year.

884
01:07:11,287 --> 01:07:14,359
No, no! Get that bill away from me.

885
01:07:19,527 --> 01:07:21,006
Fire!

Sheriff! Sheriff!

888

The animals are going wild,
and the bear is their leader!

889
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:45,206
lt's for you.

Gordy, l'm bringing him home.

891
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:51,280

They're just animals.

Oh, my God!

Back to the trucks!

899
01:08:14,847 --> 01:08:16,599
Boog, it's working.

900
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,525
Yeah. Look at them run.

901

-Send in Mr. Happy!
-Who?

01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:24,278
Go, go, go!

903
01:08:26,527 --> 01:08:28,199
Adieu!

904
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:34,365
Mr. Happy didn't go off.

905
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:37,081
Hey, whoa. We're just supposed
to run them into town.

906
01:08:37,207 --> 01:08:41,598
Well, it's time forthem
to start running, isn't it?

907
01:08:47,287 --> 01:08:51,075
Hey, Earl, ain't that yourtruck?

908
01:08:52,247 --> 01:08:54,522
That's a bummer.

909
01:09:04,527 --> 01:09:07,405
That's right. Keep running.

910
01:09:09,327 --> 01:09:10,316
Sweet.

911
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,763
Freedom!

912
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:29,880
Hello, Goldilocks.

917
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:51,045
-Keep it coming.
-Okay. Let's see how you like it.

918
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:53,759
A pillow? Oh, come on!

919
01:09:53,927 --> 01:09:55,440

You can do betterthan that.
Let's see what you got.

923

Come on.

924
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:11,003

Let's kiss this bear good night.

928
01:10:49,527 --> 01:10:52,246

929
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,605

Buddy?

931
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,362
Oh, Elliot.

932
01:11:19,727 --> 01:11:21,365
You all right, Elliot?

933
01:11:22,807 --> 01:11:25,367
l'm a little light-headed.

934
01:11:28,727 --> 01:11:31,560
Hey, Tiny. Nice show.

935
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:36,519

940
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:51,919
Hold that thought. Oh, yeah.

941
01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:53,958
Karate noises!

942
01:12:07,007 --> 01:12:08,406

-What's he doing?

946
01:12:30,527 --> 01:12:34,236
No. She's his mom.
She's taking us home.

947
01:12:34,367 --> 01:12:35,766
Every buddy?
