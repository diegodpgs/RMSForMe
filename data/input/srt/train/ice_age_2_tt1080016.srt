1
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,555
Oh boy!
This global warming is killing me!

2
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:09,298
This
is too hot. the ice age was too cold, 

3
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:12,273
What would it take to make you happy?

4
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:15,632
This,  I like!

5
00:03:57,286 --> 00:04:00,069
No running Jane! Camp rules, 

6
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,908
Make me, Sloth!

7
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,731
Make me, sir!

8
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:07,843
It’s all about respect, 

9
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:12,738
Sarah. You just ate! Wait an hour!

10
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,233
Hector! No, no! You can't pee-pee there!

11
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,960
Ok, ok! there is fine, 

12
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:18,880
Ashley! Stop picking your, 

13
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,224
Piñata!

14
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,471
Stop!

15
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:23,583
, you're supposed to wear blindfolds!

16
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,926
Ok!

17
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,422
Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth!

18
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:30,877
, mine. mine, mine,  mine!

19
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,691
Hey! You didn't have any candy in you!

20
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:39,706
Let’s bury him!!

21
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:48,056
Hey, hey! Whoah, 
Who said you kids can torture the sloth?

22
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:50,360
Manny, don't squash their creativity, 

23
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,375
Hey Manny! Diego!!

24
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,295
My bad mammal-jammel!

25
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:56,118
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

26
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:59,765
Look,  I opened my camp!

27
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:01,205
Come forth and sit, 

28
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,548
It means camp of Sid!

29
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:05,620
Congratulations.
You’re now an idiot in two languages, 

30
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:06,579
Shhhh, !

31
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:08,595
…not in front of the K-l-D-G!

32
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,090
These little guys love me! Right, Billy?

33
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,722
Don’t make me eat you!

34
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,985
Funny, kid!
That's why they're called kids!

35
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,617
I told you Sid, 

36
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:19,920
You’re not qualified to run a camp, 

37
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:23,087
Oh! Since when do qualifications
have anything to do with childcare, ?

38
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,815
Besides, these kids look up to me, 

39
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:27,598
I’m a role model to them!

40
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:30,189
I can see that, 

41
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,781
You guys never think I can do anything, 

42
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,180
but I’m an equal member of this herd!

43
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,099
I made this herd, !

44
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:40,555
, and you need
to start treating me with some respect!!

45
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,106
Come on! Sid!

46
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:45,353
Sid! We were just kidding!!

47
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,793
Hey!

48
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:49,192
Let's play pin the tail on the mammoth!!

49
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:51,880
Sid!

50
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:55,047
Can you stop!

51
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:58,982
I'm gonna get some respect!!

52
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:02,629
I’ll show 'em!

53
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:06,564
And so, in the end, 

54
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,867
the little burro reached his mommy, 

55
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,034
and they lived happily ever after, 

56
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:15,969
Good job!

57
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:18,753
Question! Why does the burro go home?

58
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,384
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbit?

59
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:24,319
Because. He wanted to be with his family

60
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,239
I think he should go with the girl burro!

61
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,870
, That's a better love story!

62
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,229
OK! Well, when you tell
your burro story, that’s what he'll do.

63
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:32,861
'Burro' is a demeaning name, 

64
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:34,972
Technically, it's called a wild ass!

65
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,139
Fine. The wild ass boy came home, 

66
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:39,771
, to his wild ass mother, 

67
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,898
See! That’s why I called it a burro!

68
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:46,969
Could the burro have a grazing problem?

69
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:49,465
- That would make him more, relatable, 
-Boring!

70
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,192
It’s not believable!

71
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:53,591
- Do burrows eat their young?
- It's not a very satisfying ending!

72
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:55,895
Sometimes I throw up!

73
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:58,390
They lived happily ever after, 

74
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,077
You can't get more satisfying than that!

75
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:02,805
One big happy family!

76
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:04,437
That’s the way it’s supposed to be!

77
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:06,836
Then, where's your big, happy family?

78
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,994
Then, the
hungry tiger eat the pesky little kids!!

79
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:19,985
- You ok, buddy?
- Sure, why not?!

80
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:23,152
- I just thought you, 
- Story time’s over,  the end!

81
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:24,879
- Out of the way! Run for your lives!
- Hey, watch it!

82
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,127
Where's everybody going?

83
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:27,567
The world's coming to an end!

84
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,198
What are you talking about?

85
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,981
Fast Tony!
He says the world's going to flood!

86
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:35,149
Folks,
I hold in my hand a device so powerful, 

87
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,300
it can actually pull air, 

88
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,932
right out of the sky!!

89
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,043
Gather round, gather round!

90
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:43,306
Pardon me, do you have gills ma'am?

91
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,130
So you can't breathe under water?

92
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,721
My assistant here will demonstrate!

93
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,696
Hey, I can smell the ocean!

94
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:51,848
What are you doing, ?

95
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,056
I can't sell that now, !!

96
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,263
You suck
air through your mouth you moron!!

97
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,814
If you're a pupil
of mine, and I'm starting instruction, 

98
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,213
you'll
have plenty of air for eons to come!

99
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:05,285
Of course, don't stay buried!

100
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,260
Why are you scaring
everybody with this doomsday stuff?

101
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:10,947
I’m trying to make a living here pal, 

102
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:15,170
It’s all part of my weather forecast!

103
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,049
The 5 day outlook is calling
for intense flooding, followed by, 

104
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:20,161
the end of the world, !!

105
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:22,560
With a slight chance of patchy sunshine

106
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,712
, later in the week

107
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,111
Come on! Don't listen to him, 

108
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:28,415
Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape!

109
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,854
Are you making an offer?

110
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:32,638
I mean no! I would not!

111
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:35,229
Haven’t you heard? The ice is melting!

112
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:37,436
You see this ground? It's covered in ice

113
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:39,836
A thousand
years ago it was covered in ice, 

114
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,083
A thousand years from now, 

115
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,619
it will still be ice!

116
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,610
Say, buddy. not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts, but, 

117
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,201
haven't
mammoths pretty much gone extinct?

118
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:51,257
What are you talking about?

119
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:53,752
I’m talking
about you being the last of your kind!

120
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:57,111
Ahh! Your breath smells like ants!

121
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,334
Be as that as it may, 

122
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,733
When's
the last time you saw another mammoth?

123
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,284
Ah! Don't pay any attention to him Manny

124
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:08,916
Mammoths can't go extinct, 

125
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,452
they are the biggest things on earth!

126
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:12,083
What about the dinosaurs?

127
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,715
The dinosaurs got cocky!

128
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:15,250
They made enemies!
-Look!, 

129
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,650
some idiot's going down the eviscerator!

130
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:19,953
Please tell me that’s not our cue!

131
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:25,712
OK, I'm gonna jump on the count of 3!

132
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,743
One,  

133
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,798
Two,  

134
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:34,253
Sid!
Don't move a muscle! We’re coming up!

135
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,461
jump!. jump!, jump!. jump!, 

136
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:37,804
, jump, jump, jump, jump!

137
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:38,956
Sorry, 

138
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,739
Two and three one thousands, 

139
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,467
Two and four one thousands, 

140
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:45,962
Sid!
What are you doing? Get down from there!

141
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:48,554
No way! I’m going to be
the first to jump off the eviscerator, 

142
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,473
And then
you guys are gonna have to start, 

143
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:52,105
showing me some respect!

144
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,120
You jump off this
and the only respect you're gonna get, 

145
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,368
is respect for the dead!

146
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,863
Come on Manny! He's not that stupid, !

147
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,646
But, I've been wrong before!

148
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,086
Geronimo!!!

149
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,789
Hey, watch it!

150
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:14,851
I can't breath, 

151
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,826
I think I just coughed up my spleen!

152
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,814
Ahh! Diego! Retract the claws please!

153
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:36,541
Oh, right, sorry!

154
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,557
You know,
if I didn't know you better Diego, 

155
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:40,476
I'd think you're afraid of the water, 

156
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:43,451
Ok, Ok! Good thing I know you better!

157
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:44,699
Guys, !

158
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:47,098
Fast Tony was right, !

159
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:49,786
everything is melting!

160
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:15,891
It’s all gonna flood, 

161
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,426
Come on! We’ve gotta warn them.

162
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:21,361
Maybe we can
rapidly evolve into water creatures.

163
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:22,993
That’s genius, Ed, 

164
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,529
Call me 'Squid'.

165
00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:28,943
Gees. this whole thing's a piece of junk!

166
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:30,671
I can't believe I live here!

167
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:35,278
What?

168
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:41,612
I can breathe, 

169
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,491
I present you
with this revolutionary gizmo, we call, 

170
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:45,451
Bark!!

171
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,371
It’s so buoyant, it actually floats!

172
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,386
I'll show you something that floats!

173
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:52,937
Alright,   it's your funeral!

174
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:05,126
You see!
This is exactly what I’m talking about!

175
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,566
Giant balls of fury larva, 

176
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:07,717
the size of mammoths, 

177
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:08,677
raining from the sky!!

178
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:11,172
Ahh! Go suck air through a reed!

179
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,148
You gotta listen
to him! He’s right about the flood!

180
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:14,627
I am?

181
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:17,027
I mean, uh, Yes, I am!

182
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:18,946
Wait a minute! You're the one who said, 

183
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,098
there wasn't going to be a flood!

184
00:12:20,002 --> 00:12:21,442
Why should we listen to you?

185
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,649
Because we saw what’s up there!

186
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:26,624
The dam's
gonna break. The entire valley is gonna flood!

187
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,655
Flood’s real alright, 

188
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,343
and it's coming fast!

189
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:36,414
Look around! You're in a bowl, !

190
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,389
Bowl's gonna to fill up, !

191
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,212
Ain't no way out, !

192
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:43,420
What are we going to do?!

193
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:46,683
Unless, you can
make it to the end of the valley, 

194
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,754
there's a boat, It can save ya!

195
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,482
I don't see anything, 

196
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:52,442
Fine, 

197
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:56,377
You all better hurry. ground’s melting, 

198
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:59,352
walls tumbling. rocks crumbing, 

199
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:02,615
survive that,
and you'll be racing through water!

200
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:04,246
coz in 3 days time, 

201
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:06,358
It’s going to hit the geyser fields, 

202
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:07,318
Boom!!!

203
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:11,733
There is some good news though!

204
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,940
The more of you die, 

205
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:16,147
the better I eat!!

206
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:20,658
I didn't say it was good news for you, 

207
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:26,609
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class!

208
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:51,370
Damn!

209
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,345
Alright! You heard the scary vulture, 

210
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,169
Let’s move out!

211
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,144
Manny, 
Do you really think there's a boat?

212
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:01,352
I don't know, 
But in a few days this place, 

213
00:14:01,352 --> 00:14:02,983
is gonna to be a mile under water, 

214
00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:04,903
If there's any hope, it's that way

215
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,649
Manny, lets go!

216
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:50,779
We’ve got an
overturned cliff on the far right lake, 

217
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,794
traffic is
packed up as far as the eye can see, 

218
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:55,289
Ohhh! And
it looks like there might be a fatality!

219
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:58,169
I call the dark meat!!

220
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:02,679
Come on everybody! Lets go!
Come on. Come, come, come! Get in!

221
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,110
Come on Grandpa, come on! We have to go!

222
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,453
Well, I’m not leaving!

223
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:13,717
I was born
in this hole and I'll die in this hole!

224
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:23,602
Do we have to bring this crap, ?

225
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:26,193
I’m sure there's crap where we're going!

226
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,209
Ahh! This was a gift from my mother!

227
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:31,568
- Ok! Keep it moving. keep it moving!
- Manny, Manny!

228
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,295
I've just heard you’re going extinct!

229
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,503
Hey! If you ever master hygiene, 

230
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,134
try working on sensitivity!!

231
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:38,862
I’m not going extinct!

232
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:39,822
Kids! Look, !

233
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:42,413
The last mammoth!

234
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:47,308
Well, you probably
won't see another one of those again!

235
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,364
See?!

236
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,819
Where is James?

237
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,840
Stu! Come on! Stu!

238
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:33,856
Lets blow this ice cube stand!

239
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,735
Stu!!

240
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:46,428
Folks! Be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home!

241
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:53,979
Some day, when you're gonna sing, 

242
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:55,994
When you make us sing, 

243
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:57,914
- Shut up Sid!
- Ok!

244
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:01,177
Stop, hey-hey, What’s that sound, ?

245
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:04,728
- All the mammoths are in the ground.
- Stop singing Sid!

246
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:13,558
Sid! I’m gonna fall on you
again! And this time I will kill you!

247
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,013
Ok, someone doesn't like the classics!

248
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:28,914
What if you're right?

249
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:31,217
What if I am the last mammoth?

250
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:34,096
But Manny,
look on the bright side. you have us!

251
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:36,880
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid!

252
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:42,254
Mammoths?

253
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:43,886
I knew I couldn't be the last one!

254
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,517
I felt it in my trunk!

255
00:19:57,514 --> 00:19:58,282
This stinks!

256
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,530
Come on!

257
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:18,629
Sorry! My stomach, 

258
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,508
hates me!

259
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:24,483
Well, 
Don't that put the 'stink' in extinction!

260
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:25,539
Whoa!

261
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:26,691
Sheesh!!

262
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,706
Oooh,  Nasty!

263
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:32,737
Manny?

264
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:37,248
I ah, I need to be alone for a while, 

265
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:41,375
You go on ahead. I’ll catch up!

266
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:50,205
One truly is the loneliest number, 

267
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:52,316
-Ow!
-Ow!, Hey!

268
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:54,811
Ohh, these work great!!

269
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:56,923
Cool!

270
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:01,146
Missed me, missed me!
Try and come and kiss me!!

271
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,105
I’ll get 'em!

272
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,177
Which end is up?

273
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:06,808
I dunno, That makes two!

274
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:08,440
Hey, ugly!

275
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:10,167
Ow!, I've got to sit on that!

276
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,214
Got you!

277
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:24,947
Ok! I’m going in!

278
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:27,827
- Sid!
- What?!

279
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,570
I felt some breeze in that one!

280
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:32,625
Smile!

281
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,359
Over here!

282
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,582
- Surrender?
- Never!

283
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:46,638
Cool!!

284
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:58,059
If any one asks. there were 50 of them, 

285
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,074
, And, they were, rattlesnakes!

286
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:02,570
Here kitty-kitty, 

287
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,393
Big mistakes you miscreants!

288
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:05,833
Miscreants?

289
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,864
Uh, Diego, they're pecking, 

290
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,799
Retreat!

291
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,919
I guess it's just you and me now, 

292
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:56,220
I knew it! I knew I wasn't the only one!

293
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:59,003
Me too! Everyone falls
out of the tree every now and then, 

294
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,251
they just don't admit it!

295
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:01,402
Wait, what?

296
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:04,185
Some of us
have a tough time holding on to branches

297
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,009
I mean
it's not like we're bats or something, 

298
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:08,216
We don't have wings to keep us up!

299
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,343
And you were in the tree. because?

300
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:13,975
I was looking for my brothers, 

301
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,607
They are always getting into trouble, 

302
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:18,102
Brothers? You mean there's more?

303
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:19,158
Sure!

304
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:21,941
, lots of us

305
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:22,997
Where?

306
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,204
Everywhere, 

307
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,028
under rocks and holes in the ground, 

308
00:23:27,315 --> 00:23:30,099
Usually we come out
at night, so birds don't carry us off!

309
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:33,362
Help! Help!

310
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:40,944
Well!!
Shave me down and call me a mole-rat!!

311
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,863
You’ve found another mammoth!

312
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:43,823
Where?

313
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:46,702
Wait a minute!
I thought mammoths were extinct!

314
00:23:48,238 --> 00:23:49,294
What are looking at me for?

315
00:23:49,582 --> 00:23:50,541
I don't know, 

316
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,653
Maybe because you are a mammoth?

317
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:53,421
Me?!

318
00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:57,164
Don’t be ridiculous!
I’m not a mammoth! I’m a possum!

319
00:23:57,164 --> 00:23:58,891
Right, good one! I'm a newt, 

320
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:00,715
This is my friend, the badger, 

321
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,018
and my other friend the platypus!

322
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:05,705
Why do I got to
be the platypus! Make him the platypus!

323
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:08,297
This guy giving you trouble, Sis?

324
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:09,256
Sis?

325
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:12,232
That’s right, these are my brothers, 

326
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:14,727
Possum,  Possum,  Possum

327
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,182
I don't think her
tree goes all the way to the top branch!

328
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:23,557
Manny, the brink
of extinction is a bad time to be picky

329
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:25,764
Hey, She should come with us!

330
00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:28,355
Are you insane? No way!

331
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:32,482
Ok! Manny wants me to ask you if
you'd like to escape the flood with us

332
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:33,250
What the?

333
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,650
I’d rather be road kill!

334
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:37,089
That could be arranged!

335
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:38,433
Ha,  funny!

336
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:41,888
Let me
have a little word with my brothers, 

337
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,959
Ellie!
Are you crazy? We’re not going with them!

338
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,414
Look! We’ll never make
it in time if we only travel at night, 

339
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:52,253
These guys can protect
us out in the open. What do you say?

340
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:55,420
- Ow!
- Why did you invite them?

341
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:58,875
Because you might
be the only two mammoths left on earth.

342
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:00,027
He has a point!

343
00:25:00,027 --> 00:25:02,810
I’m sorry.
When did I join this dating service?

344
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,882
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you, 

345
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:09,721
if, you treat us nicely!

346
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:12,312
See that!
That’s the total opposite of nice!

347
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:14,903
Maybe we'll have ourselves
a little snack before we hit the road

348
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:17,399
Want a piece of us? lets go!

349
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:18,838
Bonsai,  !

350
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,950
- I got him!
- Ow!

351
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:24,309
You know the best part, ?

352
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:26,708
We’re carrying diseases!

353
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:35,058
Ok! Thanks to Sid, 

354
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:36,594
we're now travelling together, 

355
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,937
and like it or not, 

356
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,145
we're going to be one big happy family!

357
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,392
I’ll be the daddy, 

358
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:43,120
Ellie will be the mommy, 

359
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:46,671
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves!

360
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:49,934
Now let’s move, before the
ground falls out from under our feet!

361
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:53,581
I thought
fat guys are suppose to be jolly, 

362
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:56,652
I’m not fat!
It’s this fur that makes me look big!

363
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:58,476
It’s poofie!

364
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:01,835
Ok, he's fat, 

365
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,962
Folks! Escape from the flood is a, 

366
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:39,457
perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds, 

367
00:26:39,553 --> 00:26:42,240
with fast Tony's,  disaster diet!

368
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:46,655
You, ma'm!
You look like a big fat hairy beast!

369
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:49,726
How'd you
like to lose a tonne or two of that?

370
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:51,262
Would I ever!!, 

371
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:53,182
Don’t listen to him, Vera!

372
00:26:53,757 --> 00:26:55,677
You’re already thin as a twig, 

373
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,708
I also have the perfect
cure for your eyesight, my blind friend!

374
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,668
Ohh, We'll never make it at this pace!

375
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:34,547
Ellie, it's ok!
You can lose the camouflage!

376
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:35,794
You’re safe!

377
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:38,098
Ok,  safe?

378
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:39,537
Please!! Crash,  Eddie, 

379
00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:40,785
You two, Go scope it out!

380
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,801
- What you got?
-Perimeter looks to be all clear captain

381
00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:44,624
Roger that, four-niner, over!

382
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,832
Roger. Over!

383
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,615
All clear!

384
00:27:55,949 --> 00:27:57,101
Hawk!!

385
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:06,410
What are you doing?

386
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:08,042
Playing dead, !

387
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:10,345
Manny, Why don't you do that?

388
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,169
Because, I’m a mammoth!

389
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:14,664
But you do it for treats, right?

390
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:16,200
Is he gone?

391
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:21,478
You’re safe! Get up, 

392
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:25,222
Man!, if you weren't here, 

393
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:26,757
that hawk would have swooped down, 

394
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:28,197
and snatched me up for dinner!

395
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:30,500
That’s how Cousin Wilson went!

396
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:36,067
Boy, I really feel for you, I do!

397
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:37,890
I can't
even imagine what it would be like, 

398
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,098
to be the last one of your species!

399
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:42,113
I’m not the last one!

400
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:44,321
Oh, You brave, brave soul,  

401
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,912
that's right, don't give up hope, 

402
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:49,215
Ellie?

403
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,382
Look at our footprints,  

404
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:54,686
they're the same shape

405
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,045
Well, how
do I know those aren’t your footprints?

406
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,060
Well, then, 

407
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:04,091
look at our shadows. we match!

408
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:08,026
You’re right! We’re the same!

409
00:29:08,506 --> 00:29:11,002
You must be part possum!

410
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:15,032
You wish!

411
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:31,252
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you, lets go!

412
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:33,364
We got to catch up with the others!

413
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,537
Hey! Knock it off!!

414
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:49,679
Oh cry me a river,
blubber tooth tiger. Have some fun!

415
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:53,422
Can’t you see the ice is thin
enough. without you two wearing it down?

416
00:29:53,614 --> 00:29:56,302
Oh, Diego. The ice may be
thin, but its strong enough to hold, 

417
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,661
a ten ton mammoth and a nine ton possum!

418
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:41,794
Ellie, get up!
If you play dead, you'll be dead!

419
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,001
Look at me!

420
00:30:50,336 --> 00:30:51,295
Diego?

421
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:00,509
Diego!

422
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,162
Come on,  

423
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:12,794
Come on!

424
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:15,481
This may sting a little, 

425
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,552
What in the animal kingdom was that?

426
00:32:20,744 --> 00:32:23,431
I don't know,
but from now on, playing safe, !

427
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:25,255
Water? Not safe!

428
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:33,796
That,  
was the bravest thing I've ever seen, 

429
00:32:33,892 --> 00:32:35,524
It was nothing really, I, 

430
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:37,060
Oh! It's not a compliment, !

431
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,883
To a possum, bravery is just dumb!

432
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:40,227
Yeah! We’re spineless, 

433
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:41,570
Lily-livered!

434
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:43,586
Maybe mammoths are going extinct because

435
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:45,697
they put themselves in danger too often!

436
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:47,329
Maybe you should run away more!

437
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,496
Good point! Thanks for the advice!

438
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,936
Happy to help!

439
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,623
Do you believe her?, 

440
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:57,694
"Bravery is just dumb!
Maybe you should just run away more, "

441
00:32:57,982 --> 00:33:01,341
She’s infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded!

442
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,165
You like her, 

443
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:04,412
I do not!

444
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:07,388
Don’t worry; your secret is safe with me!

445
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:10,267
- Oh, and so is yours, 
- What secret?

446
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,762
You know, 
, the one where you can't swim

447
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,394
That’s ridiculous!

448
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:16,601
Fine, but we're
living in a melting world buddy!

449
00:33:16,793 --> 00:33:19,864
You’re gonna have
to face your fears, sooner, or later

450
00:34:20,521 --> 00:34:22,056
Ok! Ready Eddie?

451
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:24,360
Set! Let’s roll!

452
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:28,295
Wait for me!!

453
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,675
Don’t wait,  gotta roll, 

454
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:42,211
meet you at the other end!

455
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:46,050
So, you think she's girl for me?

456
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,585
Oh, yeah. She's tons of fun, 

457
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:48,737
and you are no fun at all!

458
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,945
She completes you!

459
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:54,688
Yeah, yeah!!

460
00:34:55,263 --> 00:34:56,415
Hey! Hey, Manny!

461
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:58,719
Can you pull back the tree, 

462
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,158
- and shoot me in the pond?
- No!

463
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:01,502
Aw, come on, 

464
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:04,669
Now. how do you expect
to impress Ellie with that attitude?!

465
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,780
- I don't wanna impress her!
- Then why are you trying so hard to, 

466
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,508
, convince her that she's a mammoth?

467
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,236
Because, that's what she is!!

468
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,251
I don't care
if she thinks she's a possum,  

469
00:35:12,347 --> 00:35:13,787
You can't be two things!

470
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,610
On contraire,  my, friend!

471
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:19,161
Tell that to the bullfrog,
the chicken hawk or turtle-dove!

472
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:20,697
He's never gonna let up on you!

473
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:23,096
It'll be easier if you just go with it!

474
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:28,279
So, what you want me to do?

475
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:29,431
Pull back the tree, 

476
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:31,062
, and shoot me into the pond!

477
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:32,310
I don't know, 

478
00:35:33,078 --> 00:35:34,901
Well, if you are too lame to do it, 

479
00:35:34,805 --> 00:35:36,821
- we can get Ellie.
- No, no, no,  no, 

480
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:37,876
I can do it, I can do it!

481
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:40,468
Yeah, yeah. Come on. come on!

482
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:41,907
Have you done this before?

483
00:35:42,003 --> 00:35:43,827
Ha! Only a million times!

484
00:35:44,115 --> 00:35:46,418
Farther, farther, farther, 

485
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:47,954
Perfect, !

486
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,297
Fire!

487
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:54,384
I can fly, !

488
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:57,743
I believe I can fly, 

489
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,189
Crash!!

490
00:36:08,972 --> 00:36:10,316
Crash, Crash!!

491
00:36:11,372 --> 00:36:13,675
Crash, you ok? What happened?

492
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,690
Manny shot him out of the tree!

493
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:16,554
What’s wrong with you?

494
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:17,898
He said he could do it!!

495
00:36:17,994 --> 00:36:19,337
, and you listened to him!

496
00:36:20,105 --> 00:36:21,545
Crash, whatever you do, 

497
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:22,985
don't go into the light!

498
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:24,520
Can I help in anyway here?

499
00:36:25,288 --> 00:36:26,344
You've done enough!

500
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:29,991
Are you happy now?

501
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:32,582
Crash, Crash, don't leave me!

502
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:35,173
Who's gonna watch my back?

503
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:38,149
Who’s gonna be my wee man of mayhem?

504
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:43,043
Who’s gonna
roll in that dung patch with me?!!

505
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:44,387
Dung patch?!

506
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:46,786
Wait, ! My legs, !

507
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:48,514
I can stand!

508
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,105
- He can stand!
- I can run!

509
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:53,313
- He can run! It’s a miracle!

510
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:54,656
Hallelujah!

511
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:03,198
What can I say?,  They're boys, 

512
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:05,309
, they make
my life a little adventure!

513
00:37:06,365 --> 00:37:08,093
You guys are so dead!

514
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:24,984
She's not half bad, 

515
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,303
crazy and confused, but, 

516
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,743
Sweet!

517
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:31,511
So?

518
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,021
So what’s holding you back?

519
00:37:38,997 --> 00:37:39,860
My family

520
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:46,291
You can have that again, you know, 

521
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,690
No, Sid. I can't!

522
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,681
Ok, ok. But, but, but, think about it!
I mean if you let this chance go, 

523
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:57,232
you're just letting your whole species
go! And that's just, that's just,  

524
00:37:57,424 --> 00:37:58,192
, selfish!

525
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:07,117
I think
I'm starting to get through to him!

526
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:10,572
Wait, wait! I got you!

527
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:16,811
Need help?

528
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:19,498
No, no! Just catching my breath, 

529
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:22,185
- You're stuck.
- I am not!

530
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:23,913
Alright then, let’s go, 

531
00:38:26,408 --> 00:38:27,752
I can't, 

532
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:29,959
I'm stuck!

533
00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:31,687
Don't you think that, 

534
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,414
picking them up like this, 

535
00:38:33,414 --> 00:38:35,334
would be easier?

536
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,650
Ellie?

537
00:39:13,628 --> 00:39:15,547
I know this place, 

538
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:15,996
You know,  

539
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,779
deep down, I knew I was different, 

540
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,250
I was a little
bigger than the other possum kids, 

541
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:27,609
Ok, a lot bigger!

542
00:41:28,377 --> 00:41:31,640
Oh! Now I
understand why the possum boys, 

543
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,655
didn't find me appealing!

544
00:41:33,463 --> 00:41:34,807
That’s too bad, 

545
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:37,398
Because, as far as mammoths go, you're, 

546
00:41:39,222 --> 00:41:41,429
- you know, !
- What?

547
00:41:46,132 --> 00:41:47,284
Attractive!

548
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:48,723
Really?

549
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,562
- Sure, 
- What about me is attractive?

550
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,881
Well, I don't know, 

551
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:01,200
well, there's you're, uh, 

552
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:02,256
butt?

553
00:42:03,983 --> 00:42:05,519
What about it?

554
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:08,014
It’s,  

555
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,838
big?

556
00:42:10,893 --> 00:42:13,293
Oh, you're just saying that!

557
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,308
No, no, 

558
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:17,612
No, I mean it! It's huge, !

559
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:19,819
biggest darn butt I've ever seen, 

560
00:42:20,011 --> 00:42:22,698
Oh, that is really sweet!

561
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:25,482
What a crazy day!

562
00:42:25,578 --> 00:42:28,169
This morning I woke up a possum, 

563
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:30,856
and now, I'm a mammoth!

564
00:44:12,494 --> 00:44:15,469
Boy, Manny
sure took a big leap with Ellie today, 

565
00:44:15,661 --> 00:44:17,484
- He sure did.
- Yup

566
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:19,212
He stood on the shore of uncertainty, 

567
00:44:19,596 --> 00:44:22,091
and dove right in, Splash!!

568
00:44:22,091 --> 00:44:23,915
Kind of brave, huh, ?

569
00:44:24,107 --> 00:44:25,834
the way he faced his, fear!

570
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,274
I wouldn’t know, 

571
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,617
Sabre's don't feel fear!

572
00:44:28,809 --> 00:44:30,921
Oh, come on! All animals feel fear, 

573
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:32,648
It’s what separates us from safe!

574
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:34,952
Rocks! Rocks have no fear, 

575
00:44:35,624 --> 00:44:37,063
and they sink!

576
00:44:37,735 --> 00:44:39,175
What are you getting at, Sid?

577
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:41,382
It may surprise you to know that I too, 

578
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:43,686
have experienced,  fear!

579
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,757
- No! You?
- Oh, yes!

580
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:48,484
As impossible as it seems, 

581
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,788
the sloth
has natural enemies that would like to, 

582
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,419
harm, or otherwise, 

583
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:53,763
kill us!

584
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:55,202
I wonder why!

585
00:44:55,298 --> 00:44:57,698
Oh, jealousy mostly. But the point is, 

586
00:44:57,794 --> 00:44:59,425
that fear is natural!

587
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:02,401
Fear,  is for prey!

588
00:45:02,785 --> 00:45:04,992
Well then, 
You're letting the water make you, 

589
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:06,144
it's prey!

590
00:45:06,528 --> 00:45:08,639
Just jump in and trust your instincts!

591
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:12,766
You know,
most animals can swim as babies, 

592
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:13,918
and for a tiger, 

593
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:15,933
It’s like crawling on your belly, 

594
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:17,949
to stalk helpless prey!

595
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,828
Put that hunt on, ok?!

596
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,803
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick, 

597
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:25,243
I'm stalking the prey!

598
00:45:25,243 --> 00:45:27,162
Claw, kick, now, 

599
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:28,314
I look back over my shoulder, 

600
00:45:28,314 --> 00:45:29,657
to see if I am being followed, 

601
00:45:29,753 --> 00:45:30,809
and I’m breathing!

602
00:45:32,057 --> 00:45:34,456
and I'm stalking and I'm stalking, 

603
00:45:36,664 --> 00:45:38,103
I am falling, 

604
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:40,503
Correction! You're sinking, 

605
00:45:40,983 --> 00:45:42,518
kind of like a rock!

606
00:45:48,085 --> 00:45:49,908
Hey, do we do any special tricks like, 

607
00:45:50,196 --> 00:45:51,540
roll over? Or do we just, 

608
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:52,500
throw our weight around?

609
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:56,914
Sorry,
I don't know my own strength yet!

610
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:00,082
Ellie, do you realise that, 

611
00:46:00,082 --> 00:46:02,097
now
we have a chance to save our species?

612
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:04,112
Really? How are we going to do that?

613
00:46:04,592 --> 00:46:06,704
Well, you know, 

614
00:46:06,704 --> 00:46:08,719
-Oh! Uh, uh! Did you just?!
-No, 

615
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:10,639
- I didn't mean.
- I'm not a mammoth for five minutes, 

616
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:12,078
,  and you're hittin' on me?

617
00:46:12,174 --> 00:46:13,614
I wasn't saying, 

618
00:46:13,614 --> 00:46:15,054
not right now. I'm, 

619
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,109
in time, !

620
00:46:16,397 --> 00:46:17,933
I was just saying that it’s, 

621
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:19,085
our responsibility, 

622
00:46:19,372 --> 00:46:21,868
- What?!
- That came out wrong!

623
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,075
You're very pretty, 

624
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:25,227
But, we just met, 

625
00:46:25,227 --> 00:46:26,571
Responsibility, ?!

626
00:46:26,571 --> 00:46:28,394
Just doing your duty, huh? Is that it?

627
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,122
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, 

628
00:46:30,314 --> 00:46:31,945
to save your species!

629
00:46:32,233 --> 00:46:33,385
Well, I got some news for you, !

630
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:35,400
You not saving the species tonight, 

631
00:46:35,688 --> 00:46:37,128
or any other night!

632
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:48,837
So, how did it go?

633
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:50,756
Hmm! Not bad, 

634
00:46:55,843 --> 00:46:57,570
Ok, let’s go!

635
00:46:57,762 --> 00:46:59,298
We travelled with you all day, 

636
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:01,026
now you coming with us at night!

637
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:03,041
but we can't see at night

638
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:05,152
Then enjoy, the flood!

639
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:07,648
I can't even look at him!

640
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:09,663
Pervert!

641
00:47:14,558 --> 00:47:15,518
Making friends, 

642
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:18,301
everywhere you go! Just making friends!

643
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:44,118
Watch out, there's a stump!

644
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:45,366
Not anymore, 

645
00:47:47,285 --> 00:47:49,685
I thought we could walk together

646
00:47:50,165 --> 00:47:52,180
Crash, ask the man why he thinks that?

647
00:47:52,756 --> 00:47:54,484
She said she thinks you are a jerk, 

648
00:47:54,676 --> 00:47:55,635
and to go away!

649
00:47:56,019 --> 00:47:57,651
She didn't say, Ow!

650
00:47:58,515 --> 00:48:01,010
Look! Maybe if we spend more time, 

651
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:04,849
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right here!

652
00:48:05,713 --> 00:48:07,344
She said, go jump in a lake, 

653
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:08,976
and possums rule!

654
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,951
I can hear her, you know?

655
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:13,391
What do you want? A medal?

656
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,347
Stop moving!

657
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:30,954
Thank you!

658
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,223
Manny, Ellie! Lock trunks, !

659
00:48:43,815 --> 00:48:44,487
Now!

660
00:48:50,149 --> 00:48:52,452
Crash, Eddie! Grab onto that ledge!

661
00:48:58,883 --> 00:49:00,610
Funny!  And now, what's your real plan?

662
00:49:00,706 --> 00:49:01,858
Just do it!!

663
00:49:02,434 --> 00:49:03,873
- Bye Eddie
- Bye Crash

664
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:06,273
- Bye Ellie
- Go now!

665
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,743
I'm sorry, 

666
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:14,335
if what l said before offended you!

667
00:49:14,527 --> 00:49:16,446
What do you mean 'if' it offended me?

668
00:49:17,406 --> 00:49:18,941
"That" it offended her, !

669
00:49:19,037 --> 00:49:20,477
"That" it offended her!!

670
00:49:20,477 --> 00:49:22,780
I mean "that", "That" it offended you, !

671
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:28,443
You just overreacted, that's all, 

672
00:49:28,827 --> 00:49:30,458
What?! Take it back!

673
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,570
There are other lives at stake here!

674
00:49:32,474 --> 00:49:33,818
Wait a minute! He's got a point!

675
00:49:33,818 --> 00:49:34,873
He’s got nothing!

676
00:49:34,873 --> 00:49:37,273
- It was a misunderstanding!
- It was insensitive!

677
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:38,616
Apologize!

678
00:49:38,616 --> 00:49:40,248
Why me? She overreacted, !

679
00:49:40,248 --> 00:49:41,496
Just apologize!!

680
00:49:41,496 --> 00:49:42,935
- No!
- Do it!

681
00:49:42,935 --> 00:49:44,951
Ok,  I'm sorry!

682
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:45,910
What?!

683
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,694
He's right. I overreacted

684
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:49,366
You mean, you, ?

685
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:50,805
Not another word or I’ll come down there

686
00:49:50,805 --> 00:49:52,725
, and push you over myself!

687
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:02,034
Oh Oh!

688
00:50:04,817 --> 00:50:06,257
Manny! Ellie! Run!

689
00:50:19,022 --> 00:50:21,037
I guess
we finally did something right together!

690
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,821
Hey, don't mind me, 

691
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,932
just hanging off the cliff here!

692
00:50:46,471 --> 00:50:48,102
Remember the good old days?

693
00:50:48,198 --> 00:50:49,350
Which good old days?

694
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,517
Oh, you know. Yesterday, last week, 

695
00:50:52,805 --> 00:50:54,341
Back when the trees when up and down, 

696
00:50:54,341 --> 00:50:56,644
and the ground stayed under our feet!

697
00:50:58,084 --> 00:51:00,099
Yup! Those were the good days!

698
00:51:00,675 --> 00:51:02,306
Possums were possums and, 

699
00:51:02,594 --> 00:51:03,554
mammoths were mammoths, !

700
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:05,953
We should get some sleep, 

701
00:51:06,721 --> 00:51:09,601
Yeah, tomorrow is the day
the vulture said we're all gonna die!

702
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:04,786
No, no, no. I don’t want any,  

703
00:52:15,919 --> 00:52:16,783
No, no, no,  no, 

704
00:52:23,885 --> 00:52:25,133
Wait a minute!

705
00:52:26,764 --> 00:52:27,916
Can I help you?

706
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:41,353
Hmmm! Now, that’s what I call respect!

707
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:45,000
Nice!

708
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:53,637
Somebody here likes Sid, !

709
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:55,749
Who is the decorator, ?

710
00:52:55,749 --> 00:52:57,572
I mean, this is fabulous, !

711
00:53:03,043 --> 00:53:05,442
- Fire king, 
- Huh?

712
00:53:11,393 --> 00:53:13,216
Fire king?, hmm!

713
00:53:13,216 --> 00:53:14,560
Well. You know, it's about time, 

714
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,959
someone recognised my true potential!

715
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:19,647
Let there be fire!!

716
00:54:25,965 --> 00:54:28,940
If only the guys could see me now!

717
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:31,532
This is either really good

718
00:54:31,532 --> 00:54:33,163
or, really bad, !

719
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:37,674
Oh! No, no, no! Me fire king, 

720
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,977
Why kill fire king? A thousand years, 

721
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,993
bad juju for killing fire king!!

722
00:54:42,377 --> 00:54:44,392
Superheated rock from the Earth's core, 

723
00:54:44,392 --> 00:54:45,928
is surging to the crust, melting ice, 

724
00:54:45,928 --> 00:54:47,847
built up over thousands of years!

725
00:54:47,847 --> 00:54:49,863
You're a very advanced race. Together, 

726
00:54:49,863 --> 00:54:51,303
we can look for a solution!

727
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:53,894
We have one!. Sacrifice the fire king!

728
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:55,621
Well, that’s not very advanced, 

729
00:54:55,813 --> 00:54:56,581
Worth a shot, !

730
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,448
Bad juju!!

731
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:39,674
Water?  Water!!

732
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,928
Crash,
I told you not to drink before bed!

733
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:48,887
I didn't do this, !

734
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,191
At least not all of it!

735
00:55:51,575 --> 00:55:53,686
- What’s happening?
- We overslept, 

736
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:54,742
We need to move

737
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:56,853
What if we're last creatures left alive?

738
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:59,829
- We'll have to repopulate the earth!
- How, ?

739
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:02,420
Everyone’s either a dude or a sister!

740
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:04,531
Hi

741
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:05,875
Hi, hey Manny, 

742
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:08,754
Wow, what a night!
You'll never guess what happened to me, !

743
00:56:08,754 --> 00:56:11,058
I'm going to go out on a limb
here and say you were sleepwalking

744
00:56:11,058 --> 00:56:12,689
Oh, no, no, no. I was,  

745
00:56:12,689 --> 00:56:14,513
kidnapped by a tribe of mini-sloth’s, 

746
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:16,432
That was going to be my second guess!

747
00:56:16,528 --> 00:56:17,872
and they worship me, 

748
00:56:17,968 --> 00:56:20,463
I mean sure,
they tossed me into a flaming tar pit, 

749
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,095
but they worship me!!

750
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:24,494
Sid, you were dreaming! Come on, 

751
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,126
The water's
rising faster than we're moving!

752
00:56:26,222 --> 00:56:28,045
I'm telling you! I was kidnapped, 

753
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:30,061
I was worshipped and they, 

754
00:56:30,061 --> 00:56:32,844
Guys?! Oh, fine!

755
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,002
Can we slow down a little, ?

756
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:43,305
I'm dying here, 

757
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,256
It was just a figure of speech!!

758
00:56:54,438 --> 00:56:55,878
They just sit there, 

759
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,893
watching us!

760
00:56:58,277 --> 00:56:59,813
I wish l knew what they were thinking, 

761
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:07,395
Food, glorious food, 

762
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:10,466
we're anxious to try it,  

763
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:13,729
Three banquets a day,  

764
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:16,417
our favourite diet!

765
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:19,296
Just picture a mammoth steak,  

766
00:57:19,296 --> 00:57:21,791
- fried, roasted,  or stewed,  
- Oh,  

767
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:23,711
food, wonderful food, 

768
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:25,726
marvellous food, 

769
00:57:25,726 --> 00:57:29,565
glorious,  fooood!!

770
00:57:30,525 --> 00:57:32,924
Food, glorious food, 

771
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,708
poached possums or flambé!

772
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:38,491
Broth made from a sloth, 

773
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:41,274
or savoured to soufflé!

774
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,153
Why should we debate it? True, 

775
00:57:44,153 --> 00:57:46,073
you've nothing, but food!

776
00:57:46,073 --> 00:57:47,512
Oh,  foood, 

777
00:57:47,512 --> 00:57:49,816
magical food, wonderful food, 

778
00:57:50,104 --> 00:57:53,175
marvellous foood!

779
00:57:54,231 --> 00:57:57,014
Food, glorious food, 

780
00:57:57,014 --> 00:57:59,701
Flesh, picked off the dead ones!

781
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,293
We're famished for food, 

782
00:58:02,293 --> 00:58:05,172
soon, we'll be the fed ones!

783
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:07,763
Just thinking of putrid meat, 

784
00:58:07,763 --> 00:58:09,971
puts us in the mood!

785
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:12,658
Oh, food, glorious food, 

786
00:58:12,658 --> 00:58:15,057
marvellous food, wonderful food, 

787
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:16,977
beautiful food, 

788
00:58:17,265 --> 00:58:20,048
magical food, 

789
00:58:20,048 --> 00:58:23,887
glorious,  , 

790
00:58:23,887 --> 00:58:28,302
Foood!!

791
00:58:30,317 --> 00:58:31,085
There, 

792
00:58:31,277 --> 00:58:33,196
now you know what they were thinking!

793
00:58:36,076 --> 00:58:39,147
- Food, glorious food, 
- Sid!!

794
00:58:39,531 --> 00:58:41,258
What?!  It's catchy!

795
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,806
- We made it!
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures!

796
00:59:21,952 --> 00:59:24,063
Oh, it's just a little hot water and steam!

797
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:25,503
How bad could it be?

798
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:34,237
I just did something involuntary, 

799
00:59:34,716 --> 00:59:35,676
and missed!

800
00:59:36,828 --> 00:59:37,788
Ok, come on!

801
00:59:39,707 --> 00:59:41,147
Manny! Get back!!

802
00:59:41,147 --> 00:59:42,394
It's a mine field out there!

803
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:44,506
There's only one way to go, 

804
00:59:44,506 --> 00:59:46,617
- Straight through!
- Straight through?

805
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:49,113
We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you!

806
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:50,456
We'll head back, then we'll go around, 

807
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:51,224
That’s safer!

808
00:59:51,224 --> 00:59:52,760
No, no! There's no time, 

809
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,295
the dam will burst before we make it, 

810
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:56,311
- We'll drown!
- If we go through this,  

811
00:59:56,311 --> 00:59:57,558
we get blown to bits!

812
00:59:57,654 --> 00:59:59,382
- We go forward!
- We go back!

813
00:59:59,382 --> 01:00:00,630
- Forward!!
- Back!!

814
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,685
- Forward!!!
- Back!!!

815
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,605
- Can I say something?
- No!!

816
01:00:04,181 --> 01:00:07,444
You are so stubborn and hard headed, 

817
01:00:07,444 --> 01:00:08,883
Well, I guess that proves it, 

818
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:10,995
I am a mammoth!

819
01:00:12,435 --> 01:00:13,490
Come on!

820
01:00:14,738 --> 01:00:15,506
Fine!

821
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,329
I don't know! Drowning sounds like a, 

822
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:18,769
much gentler way to go, 

823
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:20,592
Blown to bits sounds so,  

824
01:00:21,072 --> 01:00:22,512
sudden!

825
01:00:32,397 --> 01:00:33,933
Ah! He's gonna get himself killed!

826
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:35,373
Manny, wait!

827
01:00:36,044 --> 01:00:36,812
Manny?!, 

828
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:00,806
", Kids, look, "

829
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:02,533
", the mad mammoth, "

830
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,069
", ends up going extinct, "

831
01:01:04,645 --> 01:01:05,989
", You can't be two things,  "

832
01:01:05,989 --> 01:01:07,044
", She thinks your a jerk, "

833
01:01:07,044 --> 01:01:08,196
", and to go away, "

834
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:10,115
", Where's your big happy family?, "

835
01:01:10,787 --> 01:01:12,227
", What's wrong with you, ?"

836
01:01:13,571 --> 01:01:16,066
Hey, come on! We got to go. now!!

837
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,264
That way!

838
01:02:02,422 --> 01:02:04,629
Do not leave your children unattended, 

839
01:02:05,205 --> 01:02:07,796
all unattended children will be eaten, 

840
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:13,267
- Have you seen a Mammoth?
- No, sorry.

841
01:02:13,843 --> 01:02:15,666
- Have you seen a Mammoth?
- No. No, I haven’t!

842
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:18,066
Possum, about 11 foot tall?

843
01:02:20,753 --> 01:02:22,385
Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?

844
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,496
- I sure have, big as life!
- Where?

845
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:25,840
I'm looking at him!

846
01:02:26,224 --> 01:02:27,183
Not me!!

847
01:02:28,143 --> 01:02:29,967
Poor guy! Doesn’t know he's a mammoth!

848
01:03:27,551 --> 01:03:28,895
I don't see her anywhere!

849
01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:30,911
Maybe she is already on board!

850
01:03:44,155 --> 01:03:45,307
All right, keep quiet!

851
01:03:45,307 --> 01:03:46,171
Come on, get moving!

852
01:03:48,762 --> 01:03:49,818
There it is!!

853
01:03:50,106 --> 01:03:50,873
Ellie, !

854
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:02,102
Come on, come on! Run!

855
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:09,876
Push!!

856
01:04:13,236 --> 01:04:14,483
You guys got to go, 

857
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:15,731
We're not leaving you!!

858
01:04:16,595 --> 01:04:18,418
- I’m not asking!
- Ellie! No!

859
01:04:21,681 --> 01:04:23,889
Ellie, don't worry! We're going for help

860
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,328
Stay here!

861
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:43,468
Help us! Somebody help!

862
01:04:43,564 --> 01:04:44,139
Manny!

863
01:04:46,155 --> 01:04:47,115
Manny, !

864
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:52,297
Manny, 

865
01:04:52,297 --> 01:04:54,313
It's Ellie! She's trapped in a cave!

866
01:05:52,474 --> 01:05:53,145
Ellie!!

867
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:55,353
Manny?!

868
01:05:59,192 --> 01:06:00,439
Help!

869
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:01,783
I'll save you, !

870
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:08,789
Great! Who's gonna save him?

871
01:06:11,477 --> 01:06:13,204
You really need to brush!

872
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:20,786
Okay, okay, okay! Jump in, 

873
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:21,746
Now!

874
01:06:23,186 --> 01:06:25,393
Come on, break it, Come on!

875
01:06:25,969 --> 01:06:27,600
You can do this,
you can do this, you can do this!

876
01:06:28,176 --> 01:06:28,944
Help!

877
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,727
Trust your instincts! Attack the water, 

878
01:06:31,823 --> 01:06:34,031
I am not your prey, I am not your prey, 

879
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,238
I am not your prey!!!

880
01:06:58,216 --> 01:07:00,424
Hector, stalking the prey, 

881
01:07:00,424 --> 01:07:03,591
Come on, kick! Even babies can do it, !

882
01:07:03,591 --> 01:07:05,990
Come on, claw, kick, 

883
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,814
claw, kick, 

884
01:07:08,294 --> 01:07:10,693
Hey! I'm stalking the prey!

885
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:17,795
Eddie!

886
01:07:31,808 --> 01:07:33,343
You did it buddy, 

887
01:07:33,631 --> 01:07:35,647
You kicked waters butt!

888
01:07:35,934 --> 01:07:38,910
Nothing to it! Most
animals can swim as babies you know!

889
01:07:39,006 --> 01:07:40,541
Yeah, but not tigers, 

890
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,077
I left that part out!

891
01:07:56,953 --> 01:07:58,105
There he is, !

892
01:07:59,832 --> 01:08:01,848
Ellie, hold on to me!

893
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,863
Manny! They're behind you!

894
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:13,061
There they are! Yeah!

895
01:09:25,442 --> 01:09:27,841
We thought we'd never see you again!

896
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:38,974
We're gonna live!

897
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:45,021
We're gonna die!

898
01:11:20,132 --> 01:11:20,996
Manny, !

899
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:36,256
Well, I’m not leaving!

900
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:39,519
Grandpa,
let go of the boat! The flood is over!

901
01:11:39,615 --> 01:11:40,958
This is my boat now!

902
01:11:44,893 --> 01:11:47,869
Hey Stu, we made it! We're gonna live!

903
01:11:48,348 --> 01:11:50,268
Well, I am anyway, 

904
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,339
- I'm gonna get you, !
- Oh, no you won't, 

905
01:11:53,339 --> 01:11:55,739
I don't know,
I’m thinkin about startin a swim school!

906
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,850
"Sid's squids"!

907
01:12:03,129 --> 01:12:05,144
All hail, fire king!

908
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:11,670
Uh, Hi?

909
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:13,302
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!

910
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,485
Fire king avert flood, 

911
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:22,132
Join us, oh great and noble flaming one!

912
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:23,379
Hmmm,  

913
01:12:24,435 --> 01:12:26,738
Whoa! No, not so fast there, okay?

914
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:28,946
You, you make a quality offer, 

915
01:12:28,946 --> 01:12:31,249
but fire king has a, 

916
01:12:31,249 --> 01:12:32,305
prior commitment, !

917
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,416
His herd needs him!

918
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,503
He is the gooey, sticky, stuff that, 

919
01:12:39,695 --> 01:12:41,231
holds us together!

920
01:12:42,286 --> 01:12:44,398
He made this herd and, 

921
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:47,373
we'd be nothing without him!

922
01:12:47,949 --> 01:12:48,717
You mean it?!

923
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,515
That doesn't mean, want to touch, 

924
01:12:59,562 --> 01:13:00,426
Don't ask!

925
01:13:44,574 --> 01:13:45,918
Whoa!

926
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:01,562
We're not the last ones anymore!

927
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,568
You're not coming?

928
01:14:09,336 --> 01:14:10,871
You wanna go with them?

929
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:12,887
I am a mammoth, 

930
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,670
I should probably be with a mammoth, 

931
01:14:16,246 --> 01:14:17,397
don't you think?

932
01:14:18,645 --> 01:14:19,989
Yeah, unless, 

933
01:14:22,388 --> 01:14:23,540
Unless, 

934
01:14:25,843 --> 01:14:28,051
Unless. I, ah, 

935
01:14:30,546 --> 01:14:32,178
I just wanna say, 

936
01:14:34,001 --> 01:14:35,441
I need to tell you, 

937
01:14:38,032 --> 01:14:40,335
I hope
you find everything you're looking for!

938
01:14:45,038 --> 01:14:46,094
You too, 

939
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:20,645
Manny, ?

940
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:24,004
You've come a long way since we met, 

941
01:15:24,004 --> 01:15:25,828
and I’ll take full credit for that, 

942
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:28,035
But you need to let go of the past, 

943
01:15:28,035 --> 01:15:30,146
so you could have a future!

944
01:15:34,273 --> 01:15:35,905
Go after her!

945
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:37,345
It’s okay, 

946
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:39,744
We'll always be here for you, 

947
01:15:40,896 --> 01:15:41,855
I’ll keep in touch, 

948
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:44,351
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a good friend, 

949
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:47,422
, point made. Now, go on, scat!

950
01:15:53,372 --> 01:15:55,388
Our Manny's growing up!

951
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:57,883
Ellie!

952
01:16:03,546 --> 01:16:04,601
Manny!

953
01:16:06,905 --> 01:16:07,673
Ellie, 

954
01:16:08,248 --> 01:16:11,032
I don't want
us to be together because we have to, 

955
01:16:11,128 --> 01:16:11,800
I want us, 

956
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,335
to be together because we want to!

957
01:16:13,431 --> 01:16:15,734
And I wanna be with you, Ellie!

958
01:16:16,886 --> 01:16:18,326
So, what do you say?

959
01:16:18,422 --> 01:16:19,478
Oh, Manny, 

960
01:16:19,478 --> 01:16:20,821
I thought you were going to let, 

961
01:16:25,524 --> 01:16:27,635
You're possum enough for me!

962
01:16:41,648 --> 01:16:42,991
Well, it's just you and me now, 

963
01:16:43,087 --> 01:16:44,431
Two bachelors, 

964
01:16:44,431 --> 01:16:46,255
knocking about in the wild!

965
01:16:47,694 --> 01:16:49,614
Fine, but I’m not gonna carry you, !

966
01:16:49,614 --> 01:16:51,053
I still have my pride, you know, 

967
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:54,028
Oh, come on, buddy. For old times sake?

968
01:16:54,316 --> 01:16:55,276
I’ll carry him!

969
01:16:58,539 --> 01:16:59,691
But you're herd's leaving!

970
01:16:59,883 --> 01:17:01,323
We are now!

971
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:06,313
Manny, who do you like better, ?

972
01:17:06,313 --> 01:17:07,273
Me or Diego?

973
01:17:07,273 --> 01:17:08,809
Diego. Not even close!

974
01:17:09,097 --> 01:17:10,920
Ha-ha! Told you!!

975
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,319
Manny!
You can't choose between your kids!!

976
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:16,103
He's not my kid.  He's not even my dog!

977
01:17:16,295 --> 01:17:19,174
If I had a dog, and my dog had a kid, 

978
01:17:19,174 --> 01:17:20,709
, and the dog's kid had a pet, 

979
01:17:20,709 --> 01:17:21,669
that would be Sid!

980
01:17:22,053 --> 01:17:23,589
- Can I have a dog, Manny?
- No, 

981
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,604
Ellie, can I have a dog?

982
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:26,468
