Yeah, it was a good one.

38
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:00,654
I did what I had to do to survive.

If I didn't, I'd be dead.

40

Did you have a good walk, dear?

- Walk? I was just out...
- We have visitors.

My dear, I think we can make
this so much simpler

74

if we agree not to lie to each other.

00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,784

I have a problem, Miss Everdeen.

79
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,509
A problem that began
the moment you revealed

80
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:11,636
those poison berries in the arena.

81
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:14,097
If that Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane,

82
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,807
had had any brains at all,

83
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:18,768
he would have blown you
to bits then and there.

84
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:20,228
But here you are.

85
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:22,480
I expect you can guess where he is.

86
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,274
Yes, I think so.

87
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,485
After that fiasco, there
was nothing left to do

88
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,071
but to let you play out
your little scenario.

89
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:32,532
And you were very good.

90
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:36,161
That whole love-crazed,
besotted schoolgirl routine.

91
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:38,163
Impressive. Truly.

92
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,457
You convinced the
people in The Capitol.

93
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,919
Unfortunately, not everyone
in the districts fell for it.

94
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:48,423
I mean, you can't know this,
but in several of them,

95
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:51,009
people viewed your little
trick with the berries

96
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,886
as an act of defiance.

97
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:55,013
Not as an act of love.

98
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:57,724
And if a girl from
District 12 of all places

99
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:01,102
can defy The Capitol
and walk away unharmed,

100
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:03,480
what is to prevent them
from doing the same?

101
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,565
What is to prevent, say,

102
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,567
an uprising?

103
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,695
That can lead to revolution.

104
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:12,697
And then, in a fraction of time,

105
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:13,990
the whole system collapses.

106
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,784
It must be a fragile system,

107
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,036
if it can be brought down
by just a few berries.

108
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:19,871
Yes, it is, indeed.

109
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,499
But not in the way you imagine it.

110
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,042
How should I imagine?

111
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,295
You should imagine thousands upon
thousands of your people dead.

112
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:31,508
This town of yours reduced to ashes.
Imagine it gone.

113
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:33,635
Made radioactive. Buried under dirt

114
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,471
as if it had never existed,
like District 13.

115
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:42,519
You fought very hard
in The Games, Miss Everdeen.

116
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,563
But they were games.

117
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:48,399
Would you like to be in a real war?

118
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:49,776
No.

119
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,403
Good. Neither would I.

120
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,739

Oh. He's a lovely boy.

123
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,413
Tell me.

124
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,502
At what point did he
realize the depth of your

125
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:09,504
indifference towards him?

126
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,673
- I'm not indifferent.
- Don't lie!

127
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,758
You promised.

128
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,438
Why don't you just kill me now?

129
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:24,860
I don't want to kill you.

130
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,863
I want us to be friends.

131

But if not friends, then allies.

132

What do I need to do?

133
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:33,535
When you and Peeta are on tour,

134
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:37,623
you need to smile.
You need to be grateful.

But, above all,

136

I just wanted to say that

340
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:21,727
I didn't know Thresh.
I only spoke to him once.

He could have killed me,

but instead he showed me mercy.

That's a debt I'll never

She wasn't just my ally,
she was my friend.

I see her in the flowers
that grow in the meadow by my house.

I hear her in a Mockingjay song.

I see her in my sister Prim.

349

She was too young,

Snow. He came to see me.

He's worried about rebellion
in the districts.

Ah. There she is.

837
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,535
Finally did the math, huh?

838
00:47:32,787 --> 00:47:35,038
And you've come to, what?

839
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:37,540
Ask me to... Die?

I'm here to drink.

Oh.

Finally, something I
can help you with.

843
00:47:45,883 --> 00:47:49,385
What's it say that Peeta
was here 45 minutes ago

844
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:52,472
begging to save your life
and you only just now show up?

845
00:47:52,556 --> 00:47:53,890
It means we have to save him.

846
00:47:54,058 --> 00:47:57,977
You could live 100 lifetimes
and never deserve that boy.

847
00:47:58,062 --> 00:47:59,479
Come on, Haymitch.

Nobody decent ever wins The Games.

There are survivors.

There's no winners.

All right, if...

856
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,234
If they call his name,
I'll volunteer in his place.

857
00:48:26,444 --> 00:48:28,028
Haymitch, thank you.

858
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:31,197
But they call my name
and Peeta volunteers,

859
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:32,949
there's nothing I can do.

860
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:38,038
You can help him in the arena.
Like you did for me.

Ah...

862
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:41,750
I think these Games are
gonna be different.

- Let go.

You don't say?

00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:32,715
Katniss has her gold Mockingjay pin.

903

I have my hair.

I'm going to get you two boys
something gold.

905

Uh... Why is that?

00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,394
A token.

Everything will be different,
because it's a Quarter Quell.

913

The Capitol has spared no expense.

914
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:12,922
A new training center.

915

New Tribute living quarters.

And of course, a very special arena.

facing other Victors.

And they all know one another.

921

You two are the outsiders.

922
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:28,520
I want you guys to forget

923
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,898
everything you think you know
about The Games.

924
00:53:31,232 --> 00:53:33,192
Last year was child's play.

925
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:37,112
This year, you're dealing
with all experienced killers.

926
00:53:37,364 --> 00:53:39,782
All right.
What does that mean for us?

927
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:42,534
That means you're gonna have
to have some allies.

928
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,954
Okay. I think that if...

929
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,789
Whoop. You're not the problem.

930
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
No.

931
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,377
Look, you're starting
at a disadvantage.

932
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,796
Most of these people
have been friends for years.

933
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,756
That just puts us higher
on their kill list.

934
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,884
Do it your own way, but
I know these people.

935
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:00,219
You go it alone,

936
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,263
their first move is gonna
be to hunt you down.

937
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:04,974
Both of you.

938
00:54:05,558 --> 00:54:07,142
Katniss, come on.

939
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,316
How could any of us
even trust each other?

940
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:18,237
It's not about trust.
It's about staying alive.

941
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:20,823
Cashmere and Gloss.

942
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:22,574
Brother and sister.
District 1.

943
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:25,411
They won back-to-back Games.
Capitol favorites.

944
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,414
Lots of sponsors.
They will be lethal.

945
00:54:29,457 --> 00:54:31,333
And the other half
of the Career Pack,

946
00:54:31,418 --> 00:54:32,626
Brutus and Enobaria.

947
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:33,752
What's with her teeth?

948
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:37,089
She had them filed into fangs so she
could rip people's throats out.

949
00:54:37,298 --> 00:54:38,507
She's committed. I'll give her that.

950
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,011
Wiress and Beetee.
Not fighters, but brilliant.

951
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:44,638
And weird. Real tech-savvy.

952
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,598
He won his Games by electrocuting

953
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:47,975
six Tributes at once.

954
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:50,519
The Morphlings.
Masters of camouflage.

955
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,939
Basically, won their Games by
hiding until everyone else was dead.

956
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:56,608
Self-medicating ever since.
Which I applaud.

957
00:54:56,818 --> 00:54:57,860
Not a threat.

958
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:00,487
Finnick Odair, right?

959
00:55:00,655 --> 00:55:03,449
Yes. He won his Games at 14.
Youngest ever.

960
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:05,617
- Extremely humble.
- You're kidding.

961
00:55:05,827 --> 00:55:08,287
Yes, I'm kidding. He's a peacock.

962
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:09,455
A total preener.

963
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,458
But he's The Capitol darling.
They love him here.

964
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:13,876
Charming, smart,

965
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,379
and very skilled at combat.
Especially in water.

966
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:18,756
What about weaknesses?

967
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:20,049
One. Mags.

968
00:55:20,258 --> 00:55:22,009
She volunteered for Annie.

969
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:25,054
Mags was his mentor
and basically raised him.

970
00:55:25,263 --> 00:55:28,682
If he's trying to protect her
in any way, it exposes him.

971
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,642
A guy like that has to know
she's not gonna make it.

972
00:55:30,852 --> 00:55:33,062
I bet when it really comes down
to it, he won't protect her.

973
00:55:33,146 --> 00:55:35,939
Well, Katniss, I just hope when
she goes, she goes quickly.

974
00:55:36,149 --> 00:55:39,193
She's actually a wonderful lady.

975
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,283
(CROWD CHEERING IN DISTANCE)

976
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:06,512
How'd we get here, huh?

977
00:56:07,055 --> 00:56:08,472
FINNICK: Katniss.

978
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:10,432
Hello, Finnick.

979
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,392
Do you want a sugar cube?

980
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:16,230
I mean, it's supposed to be
for the horses, but...

981
00:56:16,523 --> 00:56:18,107
I mean, who cares about them, right?

982
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:20,442
They got years to eat sugar,
whereas you and I...

983
00:56:20,652 --> 00:56:22,528
Well, if we see something sweet,
we better grab it.

984
00:56:24,072 --> 00:56:26,949
No thanks. But I would love
to borrow that outfit someday.

985
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,576
You look pretty
terrifying in that getup.

986
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,120

01:57:36,866 --> 01:57:38,700
Is she the one that went a little...

1798
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:40,786
Mmm-hmm.

1799
01:57:49,170 --> 01:57:50,879
Love is weird.

1800
01:57:55,468 --> 01:57:57,302
BEETEE: I have a plan.

1801
01:58:00,973 --> 01:58:02,557
JOHANNA: Finnick!

1802
01:58:02,725 --> 01:58:04,309
I have a plan.

1803
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:10,649
Where do the Careers feel safest?
The jungle?

1804
01:58:10,858 --> 01:58:12,234
The jungle's a nightmare.

1805
01:58:12,819 --> 01:58:14,486
Probably here on the beach.

1806
01:58:14,570 --> 01:58:15,737
Then why are they not here?

1807
01:58:15,988 --> 01:58:17,864
Because we are. We claimed it.

1808
01:58:18,199 --> 01:58:19,741
And if we left, they would come.

1809
01:58:19,992 --> 01:58:21,701
Or stay hidden in the tree line.

1810
01:58:21,994 --> 01:58:23,703
Which in just over four hours

1811
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:26,081
will be soaked with water
from the 10:00 wave.

1812
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:27,707
And what happens at midnight?

1813
01:58:27,917 --> 01:58:29,209
Lightning strikes that tree.

1814
01:58:29,335 --> 01:58:30,502
Here's what I propose.

1815
01:58:30,711 --> 01:58:33,880
We leave the beach at dusk.
We head to the lightning tree.

1816
01:58:34,507 --> 01:58:36,091
That should draw them
back to the beach.

1817
01:58:36,342 --> 01:58:40,095
Prior to midnight we then run this
wire from the tree to the water.

1818
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:43,348
Anyone in the water
or on the damp sand

1819
01:58:43,724 --> 01:58:45,016
will be electrocuted.

1820
01:58:47,186 --> 01:58:49,354
How do we know
the wire's not gonna burn up?

1821
01:58:49,564 --> 01:58:51,439
Because I invented it.

1822
01:58:51,524 --> 01:58:53,191
I assure you, it won't burn up.

1823
01:59:04,412 --> 01:59:06,538
Well, it's better than
hunting them down.

1824
01:59:06,956 --> 01:59:07,956
Yeah, why not?

1825
01:59:08,791 --> 01:59:10,709
If it fails, no harm
done anyway, right?

1826
01:59:11,878 --> 01:59:13,712
All right, I say we try it.

1827
01:59:14,213 --> 01:59:16,214
So what can we do to help?

1828
01:59:17,884 --> 01:59:19,718
Keep me alive for the next six hours.

1829
01:59:20,052 --> 01:59:22,345
That would be extremely helpful.

1830

(INAUDIBLE)

1831
01:59:35,902 --> 01:59:37,652
I think we need to go.

1832
01:59:37,904 --> 01:59:39,404
This plan's gonna work.

1833
01:59:40,072 --> 01:59:41,281
I think so, too.

1834
01:59:41,490 --> 01:59:45,201
And once the Careers are dead,
we both know what happens next.

1835
01:59:45,453 --> 01:59:47,287
I don't want to be the
one that shoots first.

1836
01:59:47,747 --> 01:59:49,664
What if they don't either?

1837
01:59:50,124 --> 01:59:52,000
What if all of us
refuse to shoot first?

1838
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:54,544
We might still end up dead.

1839
01:59:55,588 --> 01:59:58,423
Maybe not.
I mean, it worked for us last time.

1840
01:59:58,758 --> 02:00:00,884
They're not gonna make
that same mistake again.

1841
02:00:00,968 --> 02:00:03,595
You know and I know that there's
only one person walking out of here.

1842
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,181
And it's gonna be one of us.

1843
02:00:08,851 --> 02:00:10,977
The Careers are still out there.

1844
02:00:11,979 --> 02:00:14,814
We should stick with these
guys till midnight.

1845
02:00:15,274 --> 02:00:17,859
And if we hear a cannon, we go.

Katniss, I don't...

1848
02:00:32,541 --> 02:00:34,292
I don't know what kinda deals
you made with Haymitch

1849
02:00:34,377 --> 02:00:36,586
but he made me promises, too.

1850
02:00:46,472 --> 02:00:47,722
If you die

1851
02:00:49,016 --> 02:00:50,308
and I live,

1852
02:00:53,312 --> 02:00:54,646
I'd have nothing.

1853
02:00:56,399 --> 02:00:58,149

1854
02:00:58,818 --> 02:00:59,859
Peeta.

1855
02:01:00,236 --> 02:01:01,486
It's different for you.

1856
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:03,196
Your family needs you.

1857
02:01:12,415 --> 02:01:13,498
You have to live.

1858
02:01:15,001 --> 02:01:16,167
For them.

1859
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:27,178
What about you?

1860
02:01:29,682 --> 02:01:31,057
Nobody needs me.

1861
02:01:34,228 --> 02:01:35,395
I do.

1862
02:01:36,689 --> 02:01:37,897
I need you.

1863

JOHANNA: All right, lovebirds!

1864
02:02:10,264 --> 02:02:12,432
SNOW: She is preparing to fight.

1865

That's our girl.

Indeed.

1869

We'll toast when it's done?

1870

yourself comfortable.

Typically a lightning strike

1877

contains five billion
joules of energy.

1878

We don't want to be anywhere
in the vicinity when this hits.

1879
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:10,675
You two girls, go together now.

1880
02:04:10,843 --> 02:04:13,344
Take this. Unspool it carefully.

1881
02:04:13,470 --> 02:04:15,471
Make sure the entire coil is in the water.
You understand?

1882
02:04:15,681 --> 02:04:17,223
Then head to the tree
at the 2:00 sector.

1883

We'll meet you there.

I'm gonna go with them as a guard.

No, no, no.
You're staying here to protect me.

02:13:06,670 --> 02:13:07,670
Now, Katniss...

1960
02:13:07,921 --> 02:13:10,005
You have been our mission
from the beginning.

1961
02:13:10,382 --> 02:13:12,591
The plan was always to get you out.

1962
02:13:12,676 --> 02:13:14,427
Half the Tributes were in on it.

1963
02:13:14,678 --> 02:13:16,262
This is the revolution.

1964
02:13:16,722 --> 02:13:18,723
And you are the Mockingjay.

1965
02:13:19,433 --> 02:13:21,851
And we're on our way to
District 13 right now.

1966
02:13:21,935 --> 02:13:22,935
KATNISS: 13?

1967
02:13:23,186 --> 02:13:24,895
PLUTARCH: 13.
Yes.

1968
02:13:25,188 --> 02:13:26,355
Where's Peeta?

1969
02:13:27,899 --> 02:13:29,942
He still has his tracker in his arm.

1970
02:13:30,193 --> 02:13:31,569
Johanna cut yours out.

1971
02:13:32,571 --> 02:13:33,779
Where is he?

1972
02:13:33,947 --> 02:13:35,239
In The Capitol.

1973
02:13:36,700 --> 02:13:38,743
They got him and Johanna.

1974
02:13:39,244 --> 02:13:42,079
You son of a bitch! You son of a...

1975
02:13:42,289 --> 02:13:45,082
You promised me that
you would save him over me!

1976
02:13:45,292 --> 02:13:49,962
You promised me! You're a liar.
You're a liar.

1977
02:13:50,088 --> 02:13:51,589
(SOBBING)

1978
02:14:13,612 --> 02:14:14,904
Hey, Catnip.

1979
02:14:15,906 --> 02:14:17,239
You're okay.

1980
02:14:17,324 --> 02:14:19,074
You've just been
asleep for a few days.

1981
02:14:19,159 --> 02:14:20,409
Are we home?

1982
02:14:29,419 --> 02:14:30,503
Gale?

1983
02:14:32,672 --> 02:14:33,839
Where's Prim?

1984
02:14:34,341 --> 02:14:35,674
She's alive.

1985
02:14:36,802 --> 02:14:39,428
So is your mother.
I got 'em out in time.

1986
02:14:40,430 --> 02:14:41,806
Got them out?

1987
02:14:42,808 --> 02:14:44,308
After The Games,

1988
02:14:44,684 --> 02:14:46,477
they sent in hovercrafts.

1989
02:14:49,523 --> 02:14:52,107
And they started dropping firebombs.

1990
02:14:56,321 --> 02:14:57,780
They're not in 12?

1991
02:15:00,158 --> 02:15:01,992
There is no District 12.

1992
02:15:03,662 --> 02:15:04,995
It's all gone.

1993
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,127
