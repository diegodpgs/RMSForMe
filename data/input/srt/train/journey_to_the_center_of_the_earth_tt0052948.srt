1
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,739
- Congratulations.
- We're so pleased.

2
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:31,513
A wonderful article in the paper about you,
Sir Oliver. It's wonderful, sir! Wonderful!

3
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:34,487
Good morning, Professor,
or I should say Sir Oliver.

4
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,547
- Long article about you.
- Is there? Well, well, well.

5
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,560
I think they made a mistake about your age.

6
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,971
Paper! Paper!

7
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,675
Paper! Paper!

8
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,844
Paper!

9
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,923
It's such an honor for Edinburgh, Sir Oliver.
I cannot take your money.

10
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:14,086
- Thank you.
- Paper! Paper!

11
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,895
Congratulations, Professor.

12
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:58,000
# Here's to the prof of geology

13
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:02,508
# Master of all natural history

14
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:06,980
# Rare boy he, and rare boys we

15
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,483
# To know such a big curiosity

16
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,850
# To the braw, aye, aye, aye, aye

17
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:15,946
# To the bricht, aye, aye, aye, aye

18
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:19,891
# To the knicht, aye, aye, aye, aye,
aye, aye, aye, aye

19
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,485
# Aye

20
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,357
I'm sorry.

21
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,764
Sir Oliver, since you have
been created a knight,

22
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:33,135
I've given your students a holiday -
a day for a knight, so to speak.

23
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:39,077
First, however, there's to be a presentation.
Will the Laird of Glendarach step forward?

24
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:41,346
Sir Oliver.

25
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:46,114
In the name of the student body, in gratitude
for the knowledge you have imparted to us...

26
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,383
That's enough obituary prose.

27
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,689
An inkwell, I presume.

28
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,818
A very handsome thing.

29
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,522
Hellish to dust.

30
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,589
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

31
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,431
And now off to the playing fields, all of you!

32
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:25,517
Ah.

33
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:28,926
It cost £4.17. I was on the committee
that made the collection.

34
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:33,490
- I thank you for your efforts, McEwen.
- £5 was subscribed. That left three shillings.

35
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,058
You're not going to give me
the change, are you?

36
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:40,574
I expended it on this. A little extra token
I thought you might fancy.

37
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:44,975
I saw it during Easter week in a little window
in Glasgow, a curiosity shop.

38
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,344
It seemed to whisper to me.
"Buy me for Professor Lindenbrook."

39
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,145
What did you reply?

40
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,118
I said "Only if you can be
bought for three shillings."

41
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:57,556
- I argued with the owner all Good Friday.
- It's lava, of course.

42
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,220
But exceptionally heavy.
Could serve as a paperweight.

43
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,095
- Do you like it, Professor?
- It's a scholar's choice.

44
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,293
What are you eating tonight?

45
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,301
This being Tuesday, I'm not eating.

46
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,842
I find it very healthy
to eat only every other night.

47
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,744
Be at my house at eight o'clock.
I'm entertaining some of the faculty.

48
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:23,044
- I do not think I could.
- What's the matter with you?

49
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:27,747
You used to come to my house regularly.
Is it those frayed cuffs that worry you?

50
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,551
I won't get my other shirt
from the wash till Friday.

51
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,592
Eight o'clock sharp.
We're scientists, aren't we?

52
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:37,721
That's one society where frayed cuffs
don't matter. We've all had 'em.

53
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,767
Yes, Sir Oliver. Eight o'clock.

54
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,898
Lava.

55
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,498
I swear there's something inside.

56
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:25,744
- There's Uncle now, Kirsty.
- And high time too!

57
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,549
I thought it was Uncle Oliver.

58
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:36,521
I want it understood that not a single stitch
I'm wearing belongs to me.

59
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,922
- Good evening, Miss Jenny.
- Good evening, Alec McEwen.

60
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:43,189
- I'm early, but I trust I'm not too early.
- I didn't know you were coming.

61
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,664
Well, your uncle - I should say Sir Oliver -
ordered me to come.

62
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:50,363
Where is he? He's never
been late like this - never.

63
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:53,702
I don't know, but, to return
to the subject of my clothes,

64
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:57,005
they're my classmate's,
the young Laird of Glendarach.

65
00:07:57,111 --> 00:08:00,740
"You can't go to dinner dressed like that"
said the young laird.

66
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:05,514
"The professor knows my wardrobe"
I replied, and went to take my bath.

67
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:09,953
When I returned, my clothes had been
confiscated and these substituted.

68
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,322
I want to make it clear I have no claim
to the Glendarach tartan.

69
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:16,157
You've explained your magnificence.

70
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,288
Kirsty!

71
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,856
There will be one more guest.

72
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:25,133
- I'll seat you between the dean and the rector.
- Couldn't I sit next to you?

73
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,298
Certainly not.

74
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:33,974
Pardon my being personal, but I notice a
certain harshness in your attitude toward me.

75
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:39,246
What do you expect when it takes a command
from my uncle to bring you to this house?

76
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,848
Miss Jenny, why should I
torture myself to no purpose?

77
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,722
Two years more I have to study
for my master's degree.

78
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:49,558
Then four years more
as a laboratory assistant.

79
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,326
There's the money I owe my relatives.
They're paying for my schooling.

80
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,198
You are very logical, Mr McEwen.

81
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,932
- It's the logic of an empty purse.
- How like a Scotsman.

82
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,734
I am a Scotsman.

83
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:06,245
I know one whose purse was not empty,
because he didn't even have a purse.

84
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,714
His name was Robert Burns.
Do you know what he said?

85
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,148
Miss Jenny, the time of poetry is over.

86
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:17,054
If this is true, Alec McEwen, what are you
doing with your hand on my knee?

87
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,354
Miss Jenny.

88
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,930
Now you just wait in there.

89
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,761
Kirsty, I'll set the extra place.

90
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,779
Is there something you want?

91
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,873
- A key is stuck.
- But that's impossible.

92
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,385
It was just tuned last month.

93
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:48,512
Which one?

94
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,319
- This one. Can't you see?
- No, I can't.

95
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,954
At least you can see how unhappy I am.

96
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:58,520
You know how I've felt since
that day you entered the classroom

97
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,363
and brought your uncle
the galoshes he forgot.

98
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,936
You looked like spring itself.

99
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:10,073
# My love is like a red, red rose

100
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:15,945
# That's newly sprung in June

101
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:21,112
# My love is like the melody

102
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,558
# That's sweetly played in tune

103
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,151
I thought you were setting the table.

104
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,493
There's a key stuck. Mr McEwen is fixing it.

105
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,090
#... my bonny lass

106
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:40,406
# So deep in love am I

107
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:47,942
# That I will love you still, my dear

108
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:53,779
# Till all the seas go dry

109
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,955
# Till all the seas go dry, my love

110
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,291
# And rocks melt with the sun

111
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,994
# And I will love you still, my dear

112
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:16,107
# While the sands of life shall run

113
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:24,344
# So fare-thee-well, my only love

114
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:30,990
# And fare-thee-well a while

115
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:38,989
# For I'll come back to you, my love

116
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:49,901
# Though it were ten thousand mile

117
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:04,051
- Miss Jenny, you're crying.
- I've been over the goose... the fumes...

118
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,728
- Good evening, Miss Jenny.
- Good evening, gentlemen.

119
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,099
We were worrying
about Professor Lindenbrook.

120
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,003
Yes, we were. Isn't he with you?

121
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,165
- Isn't he here?
- No.

122
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:35,182
- Careful it doesn't go too high, Paisley.
- It's just about the limit now, Sir Oliver.

123
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,120
I gave no permission for visitors.
Oh, it's you, McEwen.

124
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:43,129
- Good lad. You can lend Paisley a hand.
- Uncle, your guests are waiting.

125
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:45,631
If you don't come now, the goose will be...

126
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,600
- Oh, goose, goose, goose!
- Tell him, Alec.

127
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:52,137
This lava you gave me is one in ten million.
I've been at it all day.

128
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:56,700
- Aye, and without a pause for lunch or tea.
- You've had three semesters of petrology.

129
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:00,975
Now then, from which volcano
could this piece of lava have emerged?

130
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,049
- Fujiyama?
- No.

131
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,517
- Mount Etna?
- Very close. The Mediterranean.

132
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,282
The Lipari island group off the coast of Italy.

133
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:12,052
- But theirs is a very light lava, sir.
- That's exactly what stumped me.

134
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,095
Inside there must be something
the weight of the heaviest rock in existence.

135
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:20,793
- But that would be Icelandic peridotite.
- Precisely.

136
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,095
- There's a piece chipped off.
- By me.

137
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,334
- What's the rock inside?
- Icelandic peridotite, naturally.

138
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,807
When I saw this, I stopped chipping.

139
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:35,914
There's some marks on the surface.
Looks like a letter or some notches.

140
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,713
Three notches made by the hand of man.

141
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,684
But how could a rock from Iceland

142
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:48,990
possibly pop out of a volcano across
the world? What's your conclusion?

143
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:53,624
Science does not jump to conclusions.
Science is not a guessing game.

144
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:56,965
We're going to melt off the crust of lava.

145
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,163
Mr Paisley.

146
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:05,739
Add 10cc of aqua regia.

147
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,938
Not too fast, you know.

148
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,947
I shall write to Professor Goetaborg
of Stockholm about this.

149
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,316
He's the leading authority on volcanoes.

150
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:16,652
How long is all this going to take?

151
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:21,683
A typically female question. To melt lava
will take as long as it takes lava to melt.

152
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:25,289
- Maybe two hours, maybe four hours.
- Two hours? Four hours?

153
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,334
Maybe the whole night.
Who cares?

154
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,698
Jenny!

155
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,536
Are you all right?

156
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:58,221
That was entirely my fault, Sir Oliver.
I don't know how it could have happened.

157
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:04,729
Mr Paisley, by your slip you've rendered
an inestimable service to science.

158
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,105
Alec.

159
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,044
See this? What would you call it?

160
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,445
As you said, it's a man-made object.

161
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:19,508
Looks like a top.
A surveyor's instrument. A plumb bob.

162
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,111
Not only looks like - it is a plumb bob.

163
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:27,388
- There are letters on it.
- It's an inscription. A message, perhaps.

164
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,190
Can you make out what it says, Professor?

165
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,595
It's in some Nordic tongue.

166
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,295
The hand that wrote this trembled.
Perhaps it was a dying hand.

167
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,807
I wonder what it's written in. Paint? Ink?

168
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:43,775
- Perhaps blood.
- Possibly.

169
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:47,380
Look at this side, sir. A signature.

170
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,508
Arne Saknus...

171
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,611
Arne Saknussem.

172
00:15:55,756 --> 00:16:00,159
I hope it isn't too much to suggest that
you take me home now, Uncle Oliver.

173
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,457
Or do I have to go alone?

174
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,863
Alone. Alone. It's unthinkable,
but it must be true.

175
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:11,836
A man took some tools and went where
no human being has ever set foot.

176
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:16,308
Alone. Into the interior of the earth, alone.

177
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:20,107
- What is he talking about?
- Arne Saknussem, the Icelandic scientist.

178
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,708
Greatest of his day. He was laughed at when
he claimed there was a world down below.

179
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:29,154
The laughter stopped when he disappeared,
never to be heard from.

180
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,517
Until tonight.

181
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,496
Get out of here, woman! I didn't ask for tea.

182
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,595
I don't want any tea! All I want is my post.

183
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:51,269
There's no use shouting at me, Sir Oliver.
I can shout just as loud as you can!

184
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,508
For two weeks you've had nothing to eat
and you haven't slept!

185
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,708
Out, woman!

186
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,910
Here's your post, Uncle Oliver.

187
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:13,697
Another day and still nothing.
Can you believe that? No answer!

188
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,726
- Where is Alec McEwen?
- At the university, looking for letters there.

189
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,239
How long does it take for a letter
to get here from Stockholm?

190
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,776
- Answer the bell.
- Did it ring?

191
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:29,381
We have to speak to Sir Oliver.
And don't tell us he's busy.

192
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,975
Callers, callers. That's all I need.

193
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:37,453
Oliver, we all know
your reputation for rudeness.

194
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,288
You also have a reputation
as a conscientious man.

195
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,954
But you've skipped every lecture
in two weeks.

196
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:47,193
- I'm involved in something important.
- More important than our university?

197
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,929
Something any university would envy us.

198
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:56,941
You laugh. What does the name
Arne Saknussem mean to you, gentlemen?

199
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,976
Saknussem... Just a second.

200
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,016
Wasn't he the one who wrote
about the lost city of Atlantis?

201
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:09,453
That was an early phase of his career.
His real fame rests on his study of volcanoes.

202
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:12,287
Out of a volcano
came this message from him.

203
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,022
It lay unnoticed for 100 years,
was probably picked up by some peasant,

204
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,259
gathered dust in a curiosity shop
till it came to me.

205
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,892
Here is a translation of the words.

206
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:25,233
"I am dying, but my life's work
must not be lost."

207
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,069
"Whoever descends into
the crater of Sneffels Yocul

208
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:32,510
can reach the center of the earth.
I did it. Arne Saknussem."

209
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,740
- The center of the earth?
- Sneffels Yocul?

210
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:38,579
An extinct volcano in Iceland.
There must be a direct route from it

211
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,482
to a region no man has ever seen.

212
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,920
But, Oliver, this is sheer fantasy.

213
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,719
You haven't heard all of it.
There's a postscript.

214
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:50,991
"At sunrise on the last day of May
the mountain Scartaris will point the path."

215
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:55,861
- Well, what do you say now?
- I'm more mystified than ever.

216
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,200
- Scartaris?
- It's a mountain peak near the volcano.

217
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:02,036
But this is a student's hoax.
You should know better.

218
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,304
Just a second, Rector.

219
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:08,040
Let's not take that tone.
Let's assume it's authentic.

220
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:13,018
Isn't the correct procedure to write a paper
and submit it to the university officially?

221
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,714
More than anything,
you must consult other experts.

222
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:20,350
- A thing like this needs verification.
- Here is my paper.

223
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,156
And I've written to
the foremost authority in Europe.

224
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,854
The Royal Geological Society?

225
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:28,162
More eminent still.
Professor Goetaborg of Stockholm.

226
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,327
And what does he say?

227
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,372
Unfortunately I've not yet received his reply.

228
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,532
And I've written to him twice.

229
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:41,912
I suggest we relax on the matter until your
famous correspondent sees fit to answer you.

230
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:45,042
And in the meantime
we could do with a cup of tea.

231
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,177
I know you two think I'm daft.

232
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,747
Think whatever you want!

233
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,993
Jenny, tea!

234
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:58,258
- When did you get here?
- Just this moment, Sir Oliver. Look.

235
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,393
It's from Stockholm!

236
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:16,710
Well, he's got his letter from Stockholm.
Did you see the shine in his eyes?

237
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:20,742
There'll never be a better moment
to tell him about our feelings for each other.

238
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,621
- He'll say yes almost inadvertently.
- What if he says no advertently?

239
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,590
You wait and see how firm
my voice can be when I speak of you.

240
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,804
Blast and damn!
Blast and damnation!

241
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,107
- The devil blast it!
- What is it, Oliver?

242
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,206
- Don't keep us in the dark.
- Bad news, sir?

243
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,788
I am stricken. The University of Stockholm
informs me that Professor Goetaborg

244
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,722
has vanished from Sweden.

245
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:04,526
His disappearance follows closely the date
my communication must have reached him.

246
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,156
With all my material.

247
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:09,394
He evidently didn't think it
important enough to answer.

248
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,902
Or too important.

249
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:16,500
McEwen, go directly to the harbor. Find out
when the next ship leaves for Iceland.

250
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,909
- Oliver, calm down.
- I will not be beaten to my goal.

251
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,178
- But what is your goal?
- You heard Saknussem's message.

252
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,913
- Oliver, you're seriously ill.
- I am seriously well.

253
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:32,391
What are you waiting for? I told you to hurry.
If you'll excuse me, I must start packing.

254
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,325
- To go where?
- To Iceland to begin with.

255
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,228
- And then?
- Where Arne Saknussem went.

256
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,357
- Oliver!
- Will you kindly stop saying Oliver.

257
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:45,302
I can't sit in my classrooms waiting,
while a scoundrel named Goetaborg

258
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:48,000
exploits what I foolishly placed in his hands.

259
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:53,512
Don't you see what's at stake? The ultimate
aim of all science: To penetrate the unknown.

260
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,310
Do you realize we know
less about the earth we live on

261
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,409
than about the stars
and the galaxies of outer space?

262
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,922
The greatest mystery is right here,
right under our feet.

263
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,925
And now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen...

264
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,398
- I must have a word with you.
- I've no time.

265
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,767
- You must take time for this, sir.
- What are you so urgent about?

266
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:23,468
- This is the most urgent moment of my life.
- Not for me. I have to be in Iceland.

267
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,876
So must I. I'm going with you, sir.

268
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,541
- Where?
- To the center of the earth, naturally.

269
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,434
# My heart's in the Highlands

270
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,597
# A-chasing the deer

271
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,532
# A-hunting the wild deer

272
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,340
# And chasing the roe

273
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,650
# My heart's in the Highlands

274
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:07,380
# Wherever I go

275
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:12,250
Right now all Iceland must be aware
that the Scots have arrived.

276
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:14,987
I wish I could sing loud enough
for Jenny to hear me.

277
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,756
Homesick already?

278
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:20,162
It is a bit painful to leave her
on the first day of our engagement.

279
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:24,362
To come back to her as a world-famous
scientist is not to be sneezed at.

280
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,564
Come here. Take a look.

281
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:34,945
Did you expect a flight of stairs
with a red carpet?

282
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:39,713
I neglected to tell you, sir.
I have a nervous fear of heights.

283
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:44,348
Well, you'll get over that
after the first million fathoms or so.

284
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,892
Million fathoms...

285
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,626
Alec, he's been here.

286
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:06,474
He's been surveying here.
This is fresh-cut wood.

287
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:10,777
- Your revered colleague from Stockholm.
- He isn't wasting any time.

288
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:16,083
- Do you think he's already gone down?
- No. The message said the last day of May.

289
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,648
Take our carriage to Reykjavik.
Buy all the rope available.

290
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:25,187
Stock up on hardtacks, salted beef, chocolate,
and all the medical supplies we need,

291
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,961
but more than anything inquire
whether they have Ruhmkorff lamps.

292
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:31,730
Have another carriage
waiting for me at sunset.

293
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:36,572
- You think we can prepare it all so quickly?
- We must. We're in a race.

294
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:38,701
What's that you're taking?

295
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,905
Jenny's farewell gift.

296
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,742
I'll keep it with me always.

297
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,524
Scartaris.

298
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,136
- Back to my hotel.
- Já, Professor Goetaborg.

299
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:08,296
My good man.
I assume my assistant sent you.

300
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:12,464
No, no, thank you.
Nobody carries a soldier's weapons.

301
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:15,973
And take your time.
These instruments are delicate.

302
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,663
Easy, coachman.

303
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:57,075
This isn't the same road we came by
this morning. I said slow down, man!

304
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:09,687
You're out of your senses! Stop your horses,
man! This is not a request, it's a command!

305
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:16,065
Can't you hear me? Slow down!

306
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,096
Stop, you fool!

307
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:29,372
Whoa!

308
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:41,089
If you've ruined my instruments,
I'll horsewhip you, so help me.

309
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:48,293
And where are we?
This certainly is not my hotel.

310
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,845
- Professor!
- Alec!

311
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,820
Where are we?

312
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,485
Apparently in an eider-feather storehouse.

313
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:17,926
- How did you get here?
- I don't know. It went so fast.

314
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:21,296
I was clubbed. I was overpowered
before I knew there was a struggle.

315
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:25,303
- Did you see who did it?
- No. I was just trying to do your errands.

316
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:28,669
I said Professor Goetaborg was a scoundrel.
He's a criminal.

317
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:33,440
Very likely he's dreamed of such a project.
Your letter was the key to the door of fame.

318
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:36,346
- Hush. Did you hear that?
- What?

319
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:38,679
Some tapping.

320
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:41,982
Don't get your hopes up, Professor.
There's not a soul around.

321
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:45,455
- Everybody is in the market square.
- Why? It isn't Sunday.

322
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:48,358
The fishing fleet is going out
for the first summer haul.

323
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:51,794
- You mean the shops are closed?
- No, the shops are open.

324
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:56,335
But every piece of rope, every lamp,
everything we'd need was sold.

325
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,892
To Professor Goetaborg.

326
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:01,799
He's staying in the very inn
where we have our rooms.

327
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,301
This time I heard it too.

328
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:10,813
- A fellow prisoner, do you suppose?
- Let's give it a signal, sir.

329
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:16,351
- It's a code.
- Morse?

330
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:19,619
I can't just make it out. Jot this down.

331
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:26,261
Dash, dash, dot, dot, dot, dot,

332
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:28,300
long dash...

333
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,734
- It doesn't make sense.
- Perhaps it's in Icelandic.

334
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,930
I don't think so.

335
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,705
We've established contact.

336
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,779
I still can't make it out.

337
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:50,720
My esteemed friend, whoever you are,
let me introduce myself.

338
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,749
Professor Oliver Lindenbrook,
University of Edinburgh.

339
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:02,733
May I ask you to interrupt your tapping
for a moment and listen?

340
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,737
In what language
would you like me to speak?

341
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:12,308
- He doesn't understand English.
- I'll try French.

342
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:17,406
Mon cher ami, vous et nous sommes
dans une situation abominable.

343
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:23,215
It's no good, sir. It sounds more Russian.

344
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,559
Gertrude?

345
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,338
Gertrude! Gertrude!

346
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,373
- It's a female prisoner.
- And her lover.

347
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:58,588
Professor, they're kissing.

348
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:02,059
I'm sorry, but for once
we must dispense with tact.

349
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:05,120
Much as I regret to disturb
this tender moment,

350
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:07,928
is there any way you can get us out of here?

351
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,209
It's a duck!

352
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:32,152
And I was just about to try Latin!

353
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:39,287
Young man with the gold tooth, I'll give you
more gold if you'll guide us to Reykjavik.

354
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,602
You take us to Reykjavik.

355
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:05,790
I understand that Professor Goetaborg
from Stockholm is stopping here,

356
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:07,951
a friend of mine.

357
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:13,393
- A friend of yours? Professor Goetaborg?
- Let's say a colleague.

358
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,558
May I have your help?

359
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,598
- He is at home, isn't he?
- Yes, I...

360
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:23,072
He is not at home. He is not to be disturbed.

361
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:29,707
- Don't tell me he's asleep with this going on.
- You cannot see him. I'm sorry.

362
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,876
Here are your coins. And here is my card,

363
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:37,412
if you'll be good enough to put it in his box
so that he'll know tomorrow that I'm around.

364
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,582
Thank you so much.

365
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:53,129
Goetaborg! I know you're in there.
Open up. This is Lindenbrook.

366
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,344
Goetaborg.

367
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:29,673
Do you see what this is, laddie?
The very last word in equipment.

368
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:31,801
Ruhmkorff lamps.

369
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:34,771
Self-generating.

370
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:40,681
- How long will they burn?
- My guess is indefinitely.

371
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:45,156
As long as they're wound up,
the induction coil will give off current.

372
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:49,126
Breathing devices.
The kind they use in coal mines in Wales.

373
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:56,029
All the instruments needed for exploring
the world below, whatever it may be.

374
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:59,901
I shall wait here till Goetaborg returns.

375
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,773
You wait too.

376
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,074
Goetaborg may be a strong man.

377
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:19,252
More treasure, sir. Climbing boots.

378
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:22,526
Alpenstocks.

379
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:24,688
Blankets.

380
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,793
Food for months.

381
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,732
A chart of the...

382
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,208
Professor!

383
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:49,880
What?

384
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:01,458
Well, Goetaborg, it seems
there's such a thing as justice after all.

385
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:06,268
So you wanted to push in ahead of us.

386
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,863
Fate took care of him.

387
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,432
Why didn't they tell us at the desk?

388
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,504
Hotels rarely advertise the fact
that there are corpses lying around.

389
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,982
The Icelander teaches us a lesson.

390
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:24,716
All right. We'll observe one minute of silence

391
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,954
in memory of a great scientist,
even if he was a blasted thief.

392
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:03,727
Alec, you mentioned fate. Slight correction.

393
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,356
Fate plus a few grains of potassium cyanide.

394
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:11,959
He was against someone
who was even more against him.

395
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:14,499
Who?

396
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,165
I'm the wife of Professor Goetaborg.

397
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,971
- Oh, my dear.
- What is it?

398
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:57,947
I was surprised my husband wasn't
at the pier to meet me. Is something wrong?

399
00:36:58,017 --> 00:37:01,111
Won't you sit down
for a minute before you go up?

400
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:04,247
Please, my dear.

401
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:11,025
He seemed so well. Early in the morning
he went to the mountain.

402
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:16,432
When he came back for lunch he received
his guest right in the lobby. I saw him myself.

403
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:19,027
They went up to his room and ate.

404
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,373
What are you trying to tell me?
That my husband is?

405
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,903
His guest left about four.

406
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:32,276
In the evening when the maid
went to make the bed...

407
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:37,185
Oh, dear God! As long as I can remember,
no one ever died in my inn!

408
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:43,355
Of course, we called a doctor,
but it was too late.

409
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:47,125
We left him up there because we knew
you were due in on the morning boat.

410
00:37:55,407 --> 00:38:01,642
Just ten days ago he was...
he was joking on the pier in Stockholm.

411
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:06,684
The moment he arrived here
he sent me a message,

412
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,846
just with one word: "Come."

413
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,425
Madam, my deep sympathy.

414
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:26,763
My name - Oliver Lindenbrook
of Edinburgh University.

415
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:29,568
I take it you're familiar with that name.

416
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:33,974
- Professor Lindenbrook.
- I see you are.

417
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:40,952
I must ask you a question, and it's just
as well that Madam Goetaborg be present.

418
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:44,716
This will be difficult for you,
madam, but it must be faced.

419
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,588
Who was the last person to see him alive?

420
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:49,752
His luncheon guest.

421
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:52,558
- And who was that?
- Count Saknussem.

422
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:58,668
Count Saknussem? I didn't realize
the Saknussem family still existed.

423
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:01,900
The Saknussems are
the oldest family in this whole land.

424
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:05,067
A descendant of Arne Saknussem?

425
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,145
And a scientist too in his own right.

426
00:39:08,247 --> 00:39:10,875
And it was he who lunched
with Professor Goetaborg?

427
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,677
They saw each other every day.

428
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:17,245
They worked together in his room
with all those charts and instruments.

429
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:21,919
I suggest that you have
an autopsy performed immediately.

430
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:26,327
You think there's something suspicious
about my husband's death?

431
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:30,698
Your husband came to Iceland
for the same reasons that brought me.

432
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:33,704
Neither he nor I could suspect
there was a third party

433
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,570
who would stop at nothing to forestall us.

434
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:39,235
He was... killed?

435
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:41,575
Poisoned.

436
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,047
This is now a matter for the police.
Go and send for them at once.

437
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,244
To your room first, madam.

438
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:53,457
Just one second, if you please. Thank you.

439
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:02,858
I am deeply distressed by your husband's
death, and I fully understand your feelings.

440
00:40:02,935 --> 00:40:06,063
However, I must ask you one question.

441
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:11,201
How do you plan to dispose of the equipment
your husband assembled up there?

442
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,279
- What does it matter now?
- Don't give it another thought.

443
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:17,315
- I'll take it off your hands.
- We can discuss it later.

444
00:40:17,383 --> 00:40:20,511
No, we cannot discuss it later, madam.
Time is running out.

445
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:23,919
My expedition must start
within the next 24 hours.

446
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,982
- Your expedition?
- Exactly.

447
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,221
I only know of the Goetaborg Expedition.

448
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,821
Husbands don't tell their wives everything.

449
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,891
I do not wish to blacken the memory of
your husband, but as I'm under pressure,

450
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,164
I must change my request to a demand.

451
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,833
I have a right to that equipment
and I claim it.

452
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:47,002
A right? To take over the work
of another man's lifetime?

453
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:51,310
- He died for that idea.
- An idea he stole from me.

454
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:53,248
- That is a lie.
- Madam...

455
00:40:53,352 --> 00:40:55,411
An unforgivable lie!

456
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:02,393
I would rather destroy every pound
of that equipment than let you have it.

457
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:17,472
"Incredible encounter."

458
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:22,742
"A Saknussem descendant turns up -
acts as if he were King of Volcanoes."

459
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:27,275
"Tries to force me to surrender
his ancestor's secret."

460
00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:30,417
"Saknussem called again."

461
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:37,018
"New complication.
My real adversary arrives: Lindenbrook."

462
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:42,123
"Undoubtedly to claim his rights.
Must fight him somehow."

463
00:41:56,715 --> 00:42:00,014
Young man, would you
come here a moment, please?

464
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:03,987
Who are those for?

465
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,053
Professor Lindenbrook.

466
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,746
- Oh. At least we have some rope.
- That's a beginning.

467
00:42:32,084 --> 00:42:35,417
Tell him to stop jabbering
and go for some more shopping.

468
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:37,580
What about lamps?

469
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:41,183
Lamps. Lamps.

470
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:44,157
What about picks?

471
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,322
And provisions. Food.

472
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,932
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Put me down! Put me down!

473
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,495
Kindly put me down! Put me down!

474
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:58,799
Will somebody please explain this outrage?

475
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:01,778
Are we to be abducted every day in Iceland?

476
00:43:09,288 --> 00:43:12,121
- She speaks Icelandic.
- I do.

477
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,353
But I wish to apologize
to you in plain English.

478
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:19,293
I went through my husband's diary,

479
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:23,198
and some of his remarks led me
to believe I did you an injustice.

480
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:27,363
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- Don't give it another thought. I shan't.

481
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:30,066
I'm Sir Oliver's assistant, Alec McEwen.

482
00:43:30,142 --> 00:43:33,339
This whole expedition began,
thanks to this lad.

483
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:35,607
Began - and that's all it has done.

484
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:38,308
Sir Oliver, this morning
you asked me for these.

485
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:40,908
If you still want them, they're yours.

486
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:44,388
Will you say that again?

487
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:48,721
I shall not stand in the way
of the Lindenbrook Expedition.

488
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:57,993
Madam.

489
00:43:58,103 --> 00:44:01,869
My husband had these boots
made specially. I hope they fit you.

490
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,741
Mine will be ready without delay. I told
your man to order some for me immediately.

491
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,938
Good, good.

492
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:13,850
What was that?
Why would you need boots like this?

493
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:16,888
Well, I can't very well go in these.

494
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:19,446
- Go where, madam?
- Don't say it.

495
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:24,125
Naturally, I'm coming along.
That's why I'm giving you all of this.

496
00:44:24,196 --> 00:44:28,656
- It's a condition. I thought you understood.
- You didn't mention any condition.

497
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:33,933
Then I do now. Whom did you intend
to take along, besides this young man?

498
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:36,907
- The big Icelander.
- Then I'll be very useful.

499
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:41,207
- He doesn't understand a word of English.
- You can't come along! You're a woman!

500
00:44:41,313 --> 00:44:43,110
And what has my sex to do with it?

501
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:48,152
We're not contemplating a stroll
down Piccadilly or the Champs Élysées.

502
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,281
Professor Lindenbrook,
I have just lost my husband.

503
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:55,318
I have nothing else to live for
any more up here.

504
00:44:55,394 --> 00:45:01,094
- Down there I can represent his name.
- The decision is not yours to make.

505
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:04,829
The police require your presence
for the investigation into the death.

506
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:07,371
I have already given my testimony.

507
00:45:08,674 --> 00:45:12,974
But, madam, quite apart from the appalling
danger, think of the inconvenience.

508
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,137
The lack of privacy.

509
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,945
In short, you don't want all of this.

510
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:21,918
I may be mad on the subject of this journey,
but I am not stupid!

511
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:24,956
To burden myself with a female
is sheer stupidity!

512
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:29,687
I resent that word. I may have been
a disturbance to men, never a burden.

513
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,388
This is an absolute holdup!

514
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:37,860
You will not receive
one iota of extra consideration.

515
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:41,929
You'll sleep where we sleep,
eat what we eat and wash when we wash.

516
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,498
Then you accept my proposition.

517
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:21,178
Professor, look!

518
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:48,265
There's our gateway!

519
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,131
Thank you, Scartaris!

520
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:27,334
Never was there a brighter sunrise.

521
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:33,315
Now we descend into oblivion
or... we enter the great book of history.

522
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,745
Roll call.

523
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:39,118
Carla Goetaborg.

524
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:42,490
- Alexander McEwen.
- Hans and Gertrude Belker.

525
00:47:42,561 --> 00:47:44,654
Oliver S Lindenbrook.

526
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:50,159
What did he say? Hans and who?

527
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,327
And Gertrude.

528
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,076
Professor!

529
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,509
Professor!

530
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:11,284
All right, you've arrived.

531
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:21,328
- Rather an alarming descent.
- I found it exhilarating.

532
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:25,264
I wonder if Madam Goetaborg
will change her mind.

533
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:27,430
You make my mouth water.

534
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:31,233
- Hans is tying the rope on her.
- I'm a fool.

535
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:35,370
I should have told him to tie her to a mule
and send her back where she belongs.

536
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,278
In what language
would you have told him that?

537
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,319
All right, she may be
of some use in that respect.

538
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:45,584
And then there's always
the blessed chance the rope may break.

539
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,566
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- Quite.

540
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:03,402
Hans insisted on a double rope, you see.

541
00:49:03,475 --> 00:49:08,071
- Did he indeed? How solicitous.
- But that was for Gertrude.

542
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:11,281
Poor Sir Oliver, stuck with a woman.

543
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,677
If only you could see your face.

544
00:49:14,753 --> 00:49:19,520
That's my consolation, madam.
I don't have to look at it. You do.

545
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:47,647
- There isn't enough rope in all Europe.
- Perhaps this is the wrong entrance.

546
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,949
The sign was unmistakable.

547
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:52,956
But there's no other way to continue.

548
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,551
Gertrude!

549
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:00,256
Gertrude!

550
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:22,310
He says there's a tunnel on the other side...

551
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:24,821
slanting downhill but walkable.

552
00:50:24,923 --> 00:50:27,016
Eureka!

553
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,922
Thank you.

554
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:41,331
Now then, a general summary.

555
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:46,343
A: We must never use more than
two Ruhmkorff lamps at a time.

556
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:49,972
B: We will not be needing
our breathing equipment for a long stretch.

557
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:53,347
Nevertheless, none of us
must ever take a step without it.

558
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:58,787
C: Use canteens freely for now. There'll be
plenty of mineral springs on our way.

559
00:50:58,857 --> 00:51:01,724
As my husband's charts indicated.

560
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:06,753
Is Professor Goetaborg to be with us
on our entire journey, madam?

561
00:51:06,865 --> 00:51:08,526
Sorry.

562
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:13,268
Well, every journey begins with a first step.

563
00:51:13,338 --> 00:51:15,499
May the good Lord be with us.

564
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,666
Onward.

565
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:22,070
And let's have some music.
Alec, will you start us off?

566
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,597
Miss Jenny.

567
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:31,140
I saw you turn pale when the dominie spoke
of those in peril at the far ends of the earth.

568
00:52:31,216 --> 00:52:34,674
The far ends of the earth -
at least that would be somewhere.

569
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:39,917
There was a clipping in a Stockholm paper.
A dispatch from Reykjavik.

570
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:44,083
- I can only read their names.
- I had it translated.

571
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:48,826
The last news was that they went up Mount
Sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys.

572
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:49,797
Yes?

573
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:53,200
And then the animals
came down without their packs.

574
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:55,363
- And?
- And that's all.

575
00:52:57,742 --> 00:53:01,269
Oliver S Lindenbrook, Alexander McEwen,

576
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:04,782
Hans Belker and... Madam...

577
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:08,250
- What's it?
- It seems a woman went with them.

578
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:11,287
A woman!

579
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:04,168
You know what they'll call that
in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich?

580
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:08,109
A slight tremor,
coming from undefined regions.

581
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:13,780
Well, we've lived through
a slight tremor. Let us proceed.

582
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:38,901
It seems to be moving away from us.

583
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:43,174
Madam, in these regions I'd never venture
to say that anything is moving away -

584
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:44,612
or coming towards us.

585
00:54:44,716 --> 00:54:48,914
The only thing we can be certain of
is that danger is always with us.

586
00:54:48,987 --> 00:54:51,080
We might as well ignore it.

587
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,934
Run!

588
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:49,570
Jump!

589
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:12,261
The three notches.

590
00:56:14,272 --> 00:56:17,935
The three notches of Arne Saknussem.

591
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:21,307
- What does that mean?
- We've been shown the right path.

592
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:23,506
Alec, the plumb bob.

593
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:29,281
Look. Without these marks,
we would have gone astray.

594
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:32,515
We'd have wasted months
exploring endlessly.

595
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:36,085
We might have taken
any one of these channels.

596
00:56:36,194 --> 00:56:39,527
But our great colleague
maketh a path for our feet.

597
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:50,540
Well, you all deserve a rest. Let us have tea.

598
00:56:51,676 --> 00:56:54,167
With a double ration of raisins.

599
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:58,906
May I comb my hair first, Professor?

600
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:03,285
Ladies on the left, gentlemen on the right.

601
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:28,170
What is it, madam?

602
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:34,480
If we'd known that you had nightmares, we'd
have made different sleeping arrangements.

603
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:38,513
Someone is walking up there.

604
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:42,720
I heard footsteps. Human footsteps.

605
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:47,925
Madam, since the beginning of time
all women have heard footsteps up there.

606
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:50,524
My hearing is extremely acute.

607
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:53,297
The hearing of all women is extremely acute.

608
00:57:53,404 --> 00:57:58,137
My wife used to hear rats in the attic, usually
the nights before I had an important lecture.

609
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:00,801
I used to go up, armed with a broom.

610
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:04,314
Alec, go up and find out. Hans.

611
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,816
Madam, will you leave those men alone?
They need rest.

612
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:12,015
Moreover, it was stipulated
that I give the orders.

613
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:15,319
There's no need to use
that patient voice with me.

614
00:58:15,426 --> 00:58:18,088
Would you rather I used an impatient voice?

615
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:21,893
Professor Lindenbrook,
I am a member of this expedition,

616
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:25,299
and as such I intend to report
any observation I make.

617
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:29,105
Alec.

618
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:34,839
Put it down in the record that a member
of the expedition reported... rats in the attic.

619
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,873
Lights out.

620
00:58:53,331 --> 00:58:56,892
Don't be afraid, madam.
I'm right here.

621
00:59:46,284 --> 00:59:48,582
Conceal these marks completely.

622
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:55,851
I'll give them some new ones.

623
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,992
This is steeper than anything
we've encountered.

624
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:38,000
It's just as well we all had a good night's rest.

625
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:40,161
Alec, take this down.

626
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:43,496
"21st day of our descent."

627
01:00:43,574 --> 01:00:50,002
"Starting from an estimated depth of 129km,
limestone formation continues."

628
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:54,384
Kai-ai, Professor.
Here are the three notches again.

629
01:00:54,452 --> 01:00:56,545
Good.

630
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:07,894
- Gertrude, wrong turn.
- Let's see. What have we here?

631
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:13,732
One heads 220º south-southwest,
the other 160º south-southeast.

632
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:18,104
Strange. I would have wagered
we'd have to bear in that direction.

633
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,144
That was Gertrude's feeling too.

634
01:01:21,212 --> 01:01:23,737
Are you sure your compass is right?

635
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:26,974
Quite.

636
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:45,161
What's he saying?

637
01:01:45,236 --> 01:01:50,538
Hans is wondering about
the ultimate goal of our expedition.

638
01:01:50,608 --> 01:01:53,736
- He's asking why.
- Alec, suppose you tell him.

639
01:01:56,247 --> 01:02:01,082
Well, why does man freeze to death
trying to reach the North Pole?

640
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:06,780
Why does man drive himself to suffer
the steam and heat of the Amazon?

641
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:12,522
Why does he stagger his mind
with the mathematics of the sky?

642
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:14,928
Once a question has arisen
in the human brain,

643
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:19,459
the answer must be found
if it takes 100 years. 1,000 years.

644
01:02:19,537 --> 01:02:23,564
Let's hear you render that into
a few well-chosen Icelandic words.

645
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:27,669
Why not simply tell him
scientists have bats in their belfries?

646
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:42,424
Are you all right? Can you unhook yourself?

647
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,926
Hans.

648
01:02:59,043 --> 01:03:01,910
- Grab his hand.
- I didn't see it.

649
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:05,941
Never mind about that.

650
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,887
How is it possible?
This way was clearly indicated.

651
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:15,188
There must have been a quake
since Arne Saknussem's day.

652
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:19,729
This is no recent fissure. This has
been here since the beginning of time.

653
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:22,925
I was not in a position
to observe it scientifically.

654
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,561
We've made a mistake
somewhere. But where?

655
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:50,185
What are you doing here?
We're supposed to stay together.

656
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:52,728
And we must never have
more than two lamps.

657
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:56,322
We've been tricked.
Tricked into the wrong tunnel.

658
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,528
Those three notches
are not Arne Saknussem's.

659
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:04,907
She's right, Professor.
Someone has passed through before us.

660
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:07,102
No need to ask who.

661
01:04:07,178 --> 01:04:10,306
Madam... heard him last night.

662
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:15,043
Now she's saying "I told you so."
Silently, I admit, but she's saying it.

663
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,055
When I wish to say something,
Professor, I say it - aloud.

664
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:23,756
Due to this development, I have no choice
but to break up the expedition.

665
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:26,091
- We must return.
- Why?

666
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:29,155
You don't strike me
as a man who frightens easily.

667
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:31,894
I'm not thinking of myself. You know that.

668
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:36,338
- I must think of you, a woman.
- We agreed I was to be one of your men.

669
01:04:36,407 --> 01:04:40,366
- But if there is a madman loose...
- He's against all of us.

670
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:42,809
Against the very concept of this journey.

671
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:50,343
What's happened? What's he saying?

672
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,388
He said we should go back to where Alec fell.

673
01:04:55,893 --> 01:05:00,796
But it's not on our route. If we're to go ahead,
we have no time for detours.

674
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,889
Then you wait here.

675
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:34,330
If only my Jenny were here to see this.

676
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:52,548
Madam, now that the boy has gone
and Hans doesn't understand English,

677
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:55,346
I must ask rather a delicate question.

678
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:58,753
I'm blushing already.

679
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:02,154
You're wearing... stays, are you not?

680
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:03,123
Professor!

681
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:06,560
Yes, I thought so.
I can hear them creaking as you walk along.

682
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:08,723
What I wear is not your business.

683
01:06:08,832 --> 01:06:12,928
Everything is my business. We'll look
the other way while you discard them.

684
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:14,732
Professor, you go too far.

685
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:17,170
We're approaching regions of excessive heat.

686
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:20,835
Nothing must impede
anyone's breathing in any way.

687
01:06:44,335 --> 01:06:47,270
Alec! Leaving in a few minutes!

688
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:03,674
I've got to take a specimen
of this back to Edinburgh,

689
01:08:03,814 --> 01:08:06,214
if it's the last thing I do.

690
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:17,921
Unique. Inexplicable.

691
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:28,964
All right, ready to go, if that boy Alec
would be good enough to appear.

692
01:08:29,073 --> 01:08:31,166
Where the devil is he?

693
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:57,592
It's a blind alley!

694
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:03,001
Keep back!

695
01:09:35,139 --> 01:09:37,232
Professor!

696
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:55,589
Hans!

697
01:10:47,144 --> 01:10:49,203
Good God!

698
01:10:58,956 --> 01:11:02,551
Hold on. Hold on to my arm... my shoulder!

699
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,093
Little bit... Hold on. That's it.

700
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:15,330
Praise the Lord!

701
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:21,062
Alec.

702
01:12:29,613 --> 01:12:31,706
Professor!

703
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:06,941
Hello! Hello!

704
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:12,351
Professor! Professor! Here I am!

705
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:09,657
Salt.

706
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:39,551
Alec!

707
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:45,086
Alec!

708
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:49,756
Professor.

709
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,527
Professor, you can't go on this way.
I've kept track of the passage of days.

710
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:57,573
- You haven't.
- We'll try the cross-channel over there.

711
01:17:57,674 --> 01:18:01,110
We were in that channel yesterday.
We left marks.

712
01:18:01,211 --> 01:18:05,614
- You won't find him there.
- I've got to find him. I'm responsible.

713
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:13,650
Look.

714
01:18:17,327 --> 01:18:20,558
No need to translate.
I can see that this is a recent break.

715
01:18:20,664 --> 01:18:21,528
Alec!

716
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,772
Can you hear me?

717
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:34,376
If you're down there, give us a sign!

718
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:42,448
Alec, listen carefully. When the echoes stop,
you must try to answer.

719
01:18:42,519 --> 01:18:46,353
If you're injured,
if you can't talk, make an effort.

720
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:51,758
Pick up a pebble and scratch the rock.
We'll hear you, I promise you.

721
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,920
Just give us a sign.

722
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:17,350
A phosphorescent pool.
A strange grave for a young Scot.

723
01:19:21,224 --> 01:19:23,920
Professor, there's no use.

724
01:19:24,027 --> 01:19:26,257
How can I live with myself?

725
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:31,528
Accept his loss, like one soldier
accepts the loss of another soldier.

726
01:19:31,634 --> 01:19:34,102
You must continue with what you started.

727
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:37,230
You must go on with
the Lindenbrook Expedition.

728
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:43,370
- The Lindenbrook Expedition!
- Yes. Go on with it.

729
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,449
It was his project as much as it was yours.

730
01:19:47,751 --> 01:19:49,946
Yes, you're right.

731
01:19:51,688 --> 01:19:57,058
We will proceed. But we won't call it
the Lindenbrook Expedition any more.

732
01:19:57,994 --> 01:20:01,794
From now on
it's the Alec McEwen Expedition.

733
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:44,803
No broken bones? Ribs all right?

734
01:20:44,908 --> 01:20:47,035
Good. Get up.

735
01:20:50,914 --> 01:20:54,008
Down there, food and water. Refresh yourself.

736
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:00,246
So you've lost your friends? Just as well.

737
01:21:10,667 --> 01:21:12,362
It's my servant.

738
01:21:15,138 --> 01:21:19,802
Too much heat, too much load...
too much fear.

739
01:21:19,943 --> 01:21:23,071
You're younger. You'll do to carry my things.

740
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,278
I'm not your servant, Count Saknussem.

741
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:33,812
Pride? Rather out of place here. Eat, drink,
then pick up those things. I'm in a hurry.

742
01:21:33,923 --> 01:21:37,290
- To steal the professor's project?
- Steal?

743
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,923
Listen, young foreigner,
I don't have to steal what belongs to me.

744
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:45,524
You're in my world now.

745
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:56,210
Stop. I need someone to carry my equipment.

746
01:21:57,714 --> 01:22:02,674
You will never find your companions or your
way out. You need me as much as I need you.

747
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:04,913
You found me. My friends could find me too.

748
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:09,288
Very well. You'll carry it
with one arm, not two!

749
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:21,870
- A hail of bullets.
- No, no.

750
01:22:21,938 --> 01:22:25,931
It's a multiple echo,
reverberating through the rock chambers.

751
01:22:26,009 --> 01:22:29,103
The last echo will give us the direction.

752
01:22:34,817 --> 01:22:36,910
166º south-southeast.

753
01:22:56,343 --> 01:22:57,776
Alec. Alec.

754
01:23:00,613 --> 01:23:02,808
Alec. Alec!

755
01:23:05,185 --> 01:23:08,951
We'd given you up, but you're alive, laddie.

756
01:23:09,022 --> 01:23:11,115
You're alive!

757
01:23:14,427 --> 01:23:16,520
Professor.

758
01:23:17,597 --> 01:23:19,155
Hans.

759
01:23:19,232 --> 01:23:21,325
Just to see you...

760
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:26,400
Where was he?

761
01:23:26,506 --> 01:23:30,567
I... I didn't think he'd shoot, but he did.

762
01:23:30,643 --> 01:23:34,579
Of course I did. What did you expect?

763
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:39,144
You are trespassers here.
I am the owner of this domain.

764
01:23:42,155 --> 01:23:45,124
You are also the murderer of my husband.

765
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:48,524
I claimed my rights. He would not listen.

766
01:23:48,595 --> 01:23:53,589
Count Saknussem, in the name of your great
ancestor, put down that preposterous gun.

767
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:56,999
No harm will come of it
if you accept my terms.

768
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:02,565
You will go back the way you came, but you
will leave the equipment I need and that man.

769
01:24:05,912 --> 01:24:08,403
You're not going to listen to a murderer?

770
01:24:08,515 --> 01:24:10,710
Never interrupt a murderer, madam.

771
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:13,947
I resent that bourgeois classification.

772
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:18,889
I'll spare your lives.
You have my word of honor.

773
01:24:22,028 --> 01:24:24,121
Give me your hand on that.

774
01:24:30,804 --> 01:24:32,829
A bourgeois trick.

775
01:24:32,939 --> 01:24:34,998
So sorry.

776
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:46,444
Now then, before we continue on our
journey, we must perform a solemn duty.

777
01:24:46,553 --> 01:24:48,612
We have to hold court.

778
01:24:52,525 --> 01:24:57,724
Here, hundreds of kilometers beneath
the surface of the earth, we are the law.

779
01:24:58,665 --> 01:25:03,500
The defendant stands accused
of one murder and one act of mayhem.

780
01:25:03,603 --> 01:25:06,868
To preserve legal formalities
I must ask you, as jurors,

781
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,568
is the defendant guilty or not guilty?

782
01:25:09,676 --> 01:25:11,735
Guilty.

783
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:14,940
Guilty.

784
01:25:28,761 --> 01:25:30,820
Guilty.

785
01:25:32,565 --> 01:25:36,126
Then the mandatory sentence is death.

786
01:25:38,738 --> 01:25:43,937
There are two bullets left. Madam,
will you be good enough to explain to Hans?

787
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:46,501
We will follow the route
marked by the notches.

788
01:25:46,613 --> 01:25:50,777
He is to wait here for ten minutes,
then carry out the sentence.

789
01:25:56,122 --> 01:25:59,819
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I can carry something with my left hand.

790
01:25:59,926 --> 01:26:04,295
You can carry yourself for a couple of days.
That's all we can expect.

791
01:26:05,598 --> 01:26:11,537
Sir Oliver, there's a slight problem.
Our friend Hans refuses to shoot the count.

792
01:26:11,604 --> 01:26:14,698
What do you mean, "refuses"?
It's a court order.

793
01:26:14,774 --> 01:26:18,574
It seems his family have been loyal
to the Saknussems for generations

794
01:26:18,678 --> 01:26:21,511
and, well, he cannot touch the gun.

795
01:26:21,581 --> 01:26:23,708
This is contempt of court.

796
01:26:25,018 --> 01:26:28,510
- All right, Alec.
- No, no, Professor... I mean, Sir Oliver.

797
01:26:28,621 --> 01:26:33,615
You mustn't look at me. I, um...
I couldn't pull the trigger with my left hand.

798
01:26:38,731 --> 01:26:43,361
Oh, no. You... you couldn't consider
for a moment that I could do it.

799
01:26:43,436 --> 01:26:46,633
- After all, I'm a woman.
- I see.

800
01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:51,369
For weeks you've been denying your sex,
and now you fall back on it.

801
01:26:51,444 --> 01:26:56,438
I would say the natural executioner
would be the leader of the expedition.

802
01:26:57,584 --> 01:26:59,950
We must face the truth, sir.

803
01:27:00,019 --> 01:27:04,513
We're much too civilized to...
to do away with a fellow human being.

804
01:27:04,591 --> 01:27:08,357
What do you propose? Drag him with us?
Feed him? Let him share our glory?

805
01:27:08,461 --> 01:27:10,554
Stop fiddling with those lamps.

806
01:27:14,934 --> 01:27:17,459
What's he jabbering about?

807
01:27:17,537 --> 01:27:21,598
I'll tell you what he's saying.
The lamps are giving out.

808
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:26,577
And I'll give you the reason. The induction
coils have been corroded by the salt.

809
01:27:26,679 --> 01:27:30,547
To save what we can, I insist that
we leave these regions at once.

810
01:27:30,617 --> 01:27:32,710
You insist?!

811
01:27:37,624 --> 01:27:41,390
As a matter of fact,
he's bloody well right. Let's be off.

812
01:27:51,638 --> 01:27:57,133
You realize Saknussem's unfastened
himself from the rope again and gone off?

813
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:00,202
What's the harm?
He'll be back when it's time to eat.

814
01:28:00,313 --> 01:28:03,976
The harm is, madam,
that he's wasting a lamp.

815
01:28:33,346 --> 01:28:35,871
Madam, will you try your lamp, please?

816
01:28:45,491 --> 01:28:47,550
- It's dead.
- Yours, Alec?

817
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:57,097
When these things are gone,
they're really gone.

818
01:28:58,338 --> 01:29:02,672
Madam, make a final note,
while you've still light enough to write by.

819
01:29:02,742 --> 01:29:06,109
- Let me, madam. My arm's quite well now.
- No need.

820
01:29:07,647 --> 01:29:10,172
"We've covered another 92km."

821
01:29:10,283 --> 01:29:12,774
"Temperature dropped seven degrees."

822
01:29:14,087 --> 01:29:18,148
"It's surprisingly cooler than anticipated...

823
01:29:18,257 --> 01:29:21,488
but darkness is closing about us."

824
01:29:21,561 --> 01:29:23,654
"This may be our last entry."

825
01:29:29,268 --> 01:29:32,260
Hans and I can cut
some rope into some torches.

826
01:29:32,338 --> 01:29:37,605
That's a good idea. What puzzles me is that
the three notches of old Arne Saknussem

827
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:40,338
still keep pointing our way.

828
01:29:40,413 --> 01:29:43,473
What kind of a lamp did he have?

829
01:29:43,549 --> 01:29:46,279
Perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp.

830
01:29:46,352 --> 01:29:50,686
From here on neither do you, Sir Oliver.
Why don't you turn it off?

831
01:29:52,358 --> 01:29:54,417
Yes, just switch it off.

832
01:30:02,201 --> 01:30:04,294
Why, it's miraculous!

833
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,164
Look at this.

834
01:30:16,649 --> 01:30:17,980
What is it, sir?

835
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:20,985
A form of algae with
the property of luminescence.

836
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,851
Light without heat. A cool, chemical light.

837
01:30:24,991 --> 01:30:28,586
You've seen fireflies, madam,
and glowworms,

838
01:30:28,661 --> 01:30:32,324
and forms of life in the sea
that generate their own light.

839
01:30:32,398 --> 01:30:34,923
The same principle is involved here.

840
01:31:10,536 --> 01:31:12,595
"256th day."

841
01:31:14,373 --> 01:31:18,810
"The phenomenal winds
vanished as abruptly as they came."

842
01:31:20,112 --> 01:31:23,639
"We are now in a stupendous
deposit of cinnabar."

843
01:31:25,218 --> 01:31:27,982
What's that curious mark
you make on every page?

844
01:31:28,054 --> 01:31:30,579
ME. McEwen Expedition.

845
01:31:31,557 --> 01:31:34,424
So whenever I've said
Lindenbrook Expedition,

846
01:31:34,527 --> 01:31:36,995
you've written McEwen Expedition?

847
01:31:38,764 --> 01:31:43,030
May I remind you that months ago
you gave me explicit orders to that effect?

848
01:31:43,169 --> 01:31:48,197
You may not remind me! I do not wish
to be corrected by you incessantly.

849
01:31:48,274 --> 01:31:49,536
Is that what I'm doing?

850
01:31:49,609 --> 01:31:54,239
You're doing it with your looks, the inflection
of your voice, the very posture of your body.

851
01:31:54,347 --> 01:31:58,181
Your entire presence
is a constant criticism of me.

852
01:31:58,251 --> 01:32:01,084
I'm tired of it. I've had enough.

853
01:32:01,153 --> 01:32:03,747
You've had enough.

854
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:12,190
Well, let me tell you, you dried-up walnut
of a man, if anyone's had enough, it's me.

855
01:32:12,698 --> 01:32:15,360
- It's I.
- It's I, it's me!

856
01:32:15,434 --> 01:32:18,961
It's Carla Goetaborg! I quit! I am leaving!

857
01:32:21,607 --> 01:32:24,235
May I send for madam's horse and carriage?

858
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,779
Well...

859
01:32:37,423 --> 01:32:40,187
Well, at least you know I have a temper.

860
01:32:40,259 --> 01:32:44,457
And from now on Alec will keep the charts.
Alec! Alec!

861
01:32:45,665 --> 01:32:47,565
Why can't he stay around?

862
01:33:30,576 --> 01:33:33,374
Kai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!

863
01:33:45,558 --> 01:33:47,992
Mushrooms! A forest of mushrooms!

864
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:53,464
They may be hundreds of years old, but
the small ones we can eat! They're delicious.

865
01:33:56,135 --> 01:33:59,832
To think they grew without sun
this far under the earth!

866
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,539
All the food we can eat!

867
01:34:16,188 --> 01:34:18,281
It's tougher than leather.

868
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,028
We'll have new soles for our shoes.

869
01:34:29,001 --> 01:34:31,128
It's like an oak tree.

870
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:19,518
Madam, you're magnificent. Mushroom steak,
mushroom soup, mushroom hash.

871
01:35:19,585 --> 01:35:24,284
Let me say this. If we'd had one more week
of that salted beef, I would have perished.

872
01:35:24,356 --> 01:35:26,824
Don't be too happy.
After some months of this,

873
01:35:26,926 --> 01:35:29,952
you'll be smacking your lips
at the thought of salt beef.

874
01:35:30,029 --> 01:35:34,989
Yes, months, months.
If we only knew how many more.

875
01:35:35,101 --> 01:35:37,899
There's no term to the work of a scientist.

876
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:41,633
Let me say this, madam.
If you hadn't been along,

877
01:35:41,741 --> 01:35:45,177
this whole journey
would have been unbearable.

878
01:35:45,244 --> 01:35:48,304
But that's not
Professor Lindenbrook's feeling.

879
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,610
It's mine.

880
01:35:50,716 --> 01:35:55,312
You see, we have no sun,
no moon and no stars.

881
01:35:56,922 --> 01:35:59,413
But then you're here.

882
01:36:01,694 --> 01:36:05,061
And what is the name of the girl you love?

883
01:36:05,131 --> 01:36:08,567
- I beg your pardon?
- The girl you love?

884
01:36:08,667 --> 01:36:11,795
- What's her name?
- Jenny.

885
01:36:11,904 --> 01:36:15,067
But why would you want
to know that just now?

886
01:36:15,141 --> 01:36:19,305
Dear Alec! There are times
when it's advisable

887
01:36:19,378 --> 01:36:21,938
to jog a young man's memory.

888
01:36:30,122 --> 01:36:31,987
Professor?

889
01:36:33,292 --> 01:36:36,819
Here's some hot mushroom porridge
for you, Sir Oliver.

890
01:36:49,909 --> 01:36:53,106
I slept as I never slept in Edinburgh.

891
01:36:53,179 --> 01:37:00,051
No street noises, no church bells,
no clatter of pans from the kitchen.

892
01:37:00,152 --> 01:37:02,586
I may move here permanently.

893
01:37:07,059 --> 01:37:09,994
What's our large friend doing over there?

894
01:37:10,095 --> 01:37:12,086
I don't know.

895
01:37:12,164 --> 01:37:14,394
Special command of His Majesty.

896
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:19,802
Is that madman still giving orders?
This is supposed to be his rest period.

897
01:37:20,372 --> 01:37:25,366
The minute you fell asleep he went off
in that direction, through the tunnel.

898
01:37:25,477 --> 01:37:29,607
He came back long enough
to order the felling of the mushrooms.

899
01:37:37,423 --> 01:37:40,324
What in the world can he want with all those?

900
01:38:09,555 --> 01:38:13,286
You've come to ask me
why I didn't take my rest period.

901
01:38:13,359 --> 01:38:18,126
I don't sleep. I hate those little slices of death.

902
01:38:18,197 --> 01:38:22,759
- It's a sea.
- It's an ocean with waves and currents.

903
01:38:22,868 --> 01:38:24,802
The ocean of the underworld.

904
01:38:24,904 --> 01:38:27,498
Some earthquake,
before the beginning of history,

905
01:38:27,573 --> 01:38:32,772
cracked wide open the great sea
and through the fissures poured this.

906
01:38:32,878 --> 01:38:35,142
The fissures closed again.

907
01:38:35,214 --> 01:38:38,377
No map ever recorded the Saknussem Ocean.

908
01:38:40,286 --> 01:38:43,221
I so christened it while you were asleep.

909
01:38:43,322 --> 01:38:47,190
It's the prerogative of the discoverer.
I congratulate you.

910
01:38:47,293 --> 01:38:51,730
You realize, Lindenbrook, that from now on
there will be no notches to follow.

911
01:38:51,797 --> 01:38:54,732
That's why you ordered a raft. I approve.

912
01:39:10,115 --> 01:39:11,173
A dimetrodon!

913
01:39:11,283 --> 01:39:13,945
If I had my gun,
we'd have fresh meat for dinner.

914
01:39:14,053 --> 01:39:16,749
That's what he's seen. He's a flesh eater.

915
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:24,761
- Can he swim?
- No, thank God.

916
01:43:17,296 --> 01:43:19,787
The wind blowing down the high street!

917
01:43:21,033 --> 01:43:23,092
Here.

918
01:43:23,168 --> 01:43:25,227
I brought you some nice apples.

919
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:32,604
- I wonder if it's cold where they are.
- Where they are. Indeed.

920
01:43:33,645 --> 01:43:35,738
Are they anyplace?

921
01:43:53,765 --> 01:43:56,632
McEwen, put that toy away
and take over the rudder.

922
01:43:56,768 --> 01:43:58,201
Yes, sir.

923
01:43:59,137 --> 01:44:02,595
- I didn't tell you to throw it away.
- It flew out of my hand!

924
01:44:04,309 --> 01:44:06,004
My watch!

925
01:44:07,746 --> 01:44:10,738
- Save the instruments.
- What's happening?

926
01:44:11,516 --> 01:44:14,007
My ring! My wedding ring.

927
01:44:14,119 --> 01:44:18,385
A field of force that snatches gold away.
This is it! This is it!

928
01:44:18,490 --> 01:44:21,982
The junction of magnetic forces
from the North Pole and South Pole!

929
01:44:22,127 --> 01:44:24,186
The center of the earth!

930
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:37,199
Hang on!

931
01:44:47,853 --> 01:44:50,151
Hold on to your rope!

932
01:45:15,147 --> 01:45:17,206
No!

933
01:45:53,418 --> 01:45:55,613
Is everyone here?

934
01:45:55,721 --> 01:45:57,712
Madam Goetaborg,

935
01:45:57,823 --> 01:45:59,916
Alec, Hans.

936
01:46:03,695 --> 01:46:05,595
Gertrude.

937
01:46:06,598 --> 01:46:08,793
And His Highness over there.

938
01:46:12,204 --> 01:46:17,073
So... the expedition with all the names...

939
01:46:17,142 --> 01:46:19,303
ends like this.

940
01:46:19,378 --> 01:46:22,006
We're alive, aren't we?

941
01:46:22,114 --> 01:46:24,981
After all, we did hit the center of the earth.

942
01:46:25,517 --> 01:46:27,576
It hit us, laddie.

943
01:46:33,492 --> 01:46:37,952
No need to tell us, madam.
He wants to know where we go from here.

944
01:46:38,964 --> 01:46:41,694
Tired minds don't plan well.

945
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,893
Sleep first, plan later.

946
01:46:48,407 --> 01:46:51,433
When I refused to eat my porridge
when I was a boy,

947
01:46:51,576 --> 01:46:54,170
my mother - like all mothers - used to say

948
01:46:54,246 --> 01:46:59,809
"Oliver, the day may come when
you'd very much like to have that porridge."

949
01:47:02,053 --> 01:47:06,956
Why do you look so surprised? Is it
incredible to you that I ever had a mother?

950
01:47:08,393 --> 01:47:13,922
I was just thinking how proud she'd be of
that little boy who wouldn't eat his porridge.

951
01:48:11,723 --> 01:48:13,782
Here, duck.

952
01:48:14,392 --> 01:48:16,519
Here, duck.

953
01:48:29,107 --> 01:48:31,200
Gertrude?

954
01:48:34,613 --> 01:48:36,706
Gertrude?

955
01:48:43,889 --> 01:48:45,948
Gertrude?

956
01:48:48,894 --> 01:48:50,293
Gertrude!

957
01:48:58,970 --> 01:49:00,961
Gertrude!

958
01:49:05,644 --> 01:49:07,703
Gertrude! Gertrude!

959
01:49:08,547 --> 01:49:10,640
Gertrude!

960
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:53,553
Hans! Hans!

961
01:50:00,599 --> 01:50:02,692
Why do you look at me like that?

962
01:50:04,002 --> 01:50:05,799
Hans!

963
01:50:06,538 --> 01:50:09,837
I needed food, so I took it.

964
01:50:10,842 --> 01:50:14,710
Professor, tell your man to calm himself.

965
01:50:14,779 --> 01:50:19,113
I'm not in the mood to engage in a dispute
about a slaughtered duck.

966
01:50:19,184 --> 01:50:22,950
Professor, stop him! Stop this fool!

967
01:50:23,021 --> 01:50:25,114
- Hans!
- Hans!

968
01:50:37,369 --> 01:50:40,827
You ingrates! What can you do without me?

969
01:50:40,939 --> 01:50:44,807
Only I can show you
the way out of this realm of mine.

970
01:50:44,876 --> 01:50:45,968
Look out!

971
01:51:18,243 --> 01:51:20,336
This is the sunken city.

972
01:51:21,713 --> 01:51:28,016
After 5,000 years,
behold a fragment of the lost Atlantis.

973
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:41,558
All we know about it
comes from the Greek.

974
01:51:41,666 --> 01:51:46,660
The floor of the sea opened up
and swallowed the whole island of Atlantis.

975
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:52,840
This must have been the market square.

976
01:51:54,379 --> 01:51:58,873
Professor. Professor,
this looks like some sort of inn.

977
01:52:00,752 --> 01:52:04,153
It is an inn. An eating place, certainly.

978
01:52:04,823 --> 01:52:08,554
"Eating." What a word.
What a wonderful word.

979
01:52:11,730 --> 01:52:16,633
Well, we've learned one thing
about the inhabitants of Atlantis.

980
01:52:16,768 --> 01:52:18,827
They ate oysters.

981
01:52:32,751 --> 01:52:36,152
Stale bread. We must speak to the baker.

982
01:52:37,155 --> 01:52:39,715
Madam! Madam!

983
01:52:40,425 --> 01:52:41,653
Já?

984
01:52:45,764 --> 01:52:50,428
- He's asking if that was a temple to their god.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.

985
01:52:53,538 --> 01:52:57,338
It's some sort of altar stone
where the sacred flame burned.

986
01:52:57,408 --> 01:53:01,936
- It's serpentine, isn't it?
- Exactly. A massive form of asbestos.

987
01:53:02,013 --> 01:53:06,950
To think that at a moment like this
I've no pad and pencil to record it all.

988
01:53:14,559 --> 01:53:17,357
Turn around, madam. Don't look.

989
01:53:17,428 --> 01:53:19,521
What is it?

990
01:53:21,099 --> 01:53:25,593
The great Arne Saknussem, I presume.

991
01:53:25,703 --> 01:53:28,171
So this is as far as you came.

992
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:32,403
What's the matter with you two?
Say "how do you do" to a brave man.

993
01:53:33,845 --> 01:53:38,441
He must have dragged himself here
with a broken leg. Look at that tibia.

994
01:53:39,818 --> 01:53:42,582
- You won't find anything edible in there.
- Why not?

995
01:53:42,654 --> 01:53:45,384
The Chinese eat eggs over 400 years old.

996
01:53:47,926 --> 01:53:50,190
Gunpowder.

997
01:53:51,396 --> 01:53:53,956
Professor, look at his right hand.

998
01:53:54,032 --> 01:53:56,125
It's pointing somewhere.

999
01:53:57,969 --> 01:54:00,028
To that shaft over there.

1000
01:54:38,409 --> 01:54:42,573
Of course! Of course!
This is what the pointing finger meant!

1001
01:54:42,647 --> 01:54:46,947
This is the way up.
He couldn't make it, but we can!

1002
01:54:47,018 --> 01:54:51,648
This is the volcanic chimney.
The violent updraft can mean only one thing:

1003
01:54:51,756 --> 01:54:53,951
A direct hatchway to the surface.

1004
01:54:54,058 --> 01:54:57,186
- And we can climb up.
- Madam, explain to Hans.

1005
01:54:57,262 --> 01:55:00,459
Let him venture 100 meters or so
on reconnoiter.

1006
01:55:00,565 --> 01:55:02,931
The updraft can't carry him away.

1007
01:55:27,792 --> 01:55:30,886
Now I'd say let's roll up our sleeves -
if we had any.

1008
01:55:30,962 --> 01:55:33,897
We mustn't hope for much.
This light won't stay with us.

1009
01:55:33,965 --> 01:55:37,492
- We'll have to provide some kind of light.
- And food.

1010
01:55:37,568 --> 01:55:41,527
I'll go see what I can find.
I'll comb every inch of Atlantis.

1011
01:56:13,604 --> 01:56:16,072
If we only had some shears,
we could cut it off.

1012
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:18,199
Could we?

1013
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:34,558
Kai-ai! Kai-ai!

1014
01:56:34,959 --> 01:56:37,291
Kai-ai! Kai-ai!

1015
01:56:39,397 --> 01:56:42,298
Flints! I've found some flints.

1016
01:56:44,535 --> 01:56:47,129
Good lad. We won't be walking in darkness.

1017
01:57:02,387 --> 01:57:07,484
I wish I had better news. It gives every
indication of being a perfect passage upward,

1018
01:57:07,558 --> 01:57:10,254
straighter than the one we descended.

1019
01:57:10,328 --> 01:57:12,694
- But...
- But? But?

1020
01:57:13,598 --> 01:57:18,900
There's an obstacle. A gigantic block
of stone obstructs the passageway.

1021
01:57:18,970 --> 01:57:21,939
Hans said only a landslide
could ever move it.

1022
01:57:46,330 --> 01:57:48,389
No, let him be.

1023
01:57:49,133 --> 01:57:51,397
If his hopes hadn't been so high...

1024
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:59,237
- Alec!
- Yes, sir?

1025
01:57:59,911 --> 01:58:03,369
The haversack -
Arne Saknussem's haversack. Get it.

1026
01:58:03,514 --> 01:58:07,917
If God is with us and that gunpowder
has kept its ginger over the years,

1027
01:58:07,985 --> 01:58:10,715
we'll make that landslide ourselves.

1028
01:58:55,133 --> 01:58:57,897
Now, my wonderful companions,

1029
01:58:57,969 --> 01:59:01,700
you realize, I hope,
that we're taking an enormous chance.

1030
01:59:01,772 --> 01:59:04,036
But it's our only chance.

1031
01:59:04,108 --> 01:59:07,635
I guarantee that this'll blow up
the obstructing rock.

1032
01:59:07,712 --> 01:59:13,378
Whether the surrounding rocks will take the
disturbance lightly, I cannot guarantee.

1033
01:59:13,484 --> 01:59:15,850
Let's get what protection we can.

1034
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,979
Into the altar stone.

1035
01:59:39,143 --> 01:59:42,704
Dear God, ruler of heaven and earth...

1036
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:45,510
Don't set any limit to his realm, laddie.

1037
01:59:48,186 --> 01:59:51,883
God of the universe,
we are in thy merciful hands.

1038
02:00:15,046 --> 02:00:17,776
- Look out!
- Run, Professor! A monster!

1039
02:00:22,153 --> 02:00:24,246
Let me go!

1040
02:01:15,139 --> 02:01:17,573
We've started an earthquake!

1041
02:02:23,441 --> 02:02:26,205
The lava is pushing us up!

1042
02:02:55,940 --> 02:03:00,377
- It's an earthquake of unusual magnitude!
- More likely it's a volcanic eruption.

1043
02:03:00,444 --> 02:03:05,006
Listen to this. "Stromboli, Italy.
First eyewitness report."

1044
02:03:05,116 --> 02:03:09,576
"The capsule of the dead volcano
broke under a tremendous explosion."

1045
02:03:09,687 --> 02:03:13,919
"Rocks of extraordinary size
are being spewed out into the sea."

1046
02:03:39,617 --> 02:03:41,710
Dammi una mano.

1047
02:03:44,622 --> 02:03:47,318
Piano. Piano.

1048
02:03:54,331 --> 02:03:57,357
- Passami il vino.
- Ecco.

1049
02:03:57,435 --> 02:03:59,528
Signora, beva, beva.

1050
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:05,308
Where's Alec?

1051
02:04:10,915 --> 02:04:15,784
Hans says... Alec was thrown
from the altar stone...

1052
02:04:17,188 --> 02:04:19,952
long before we hit the water.

1053
02:04:23,828 --> 02:04:26,422
Non si preoccupi. Abbiamo uno scalino.

1054
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:30,159
I'm most grateful, ladies,
but my immediate need is not a ladder.

1055
02:04:30,234 --> 02:04:33,567
I need trousers. Pants.

1056
02:04:33,637 --> 02:04:36,128
Pantaloons. Pantaloons.

1057
02:04:36,807 --> 02:04:40,299
- Vuole i pantaloni.
- Pantaloni.

1058
02:04:40,945 --> 02:04:44,346
Don't bring them yourselves.
Send a friar, a monk.

1059
02:04:53,190 --> 02:04:55,249
Excuse me, ladies.

1060
02:04:57,795 --> 02:04:59,854
Excuse me.

1061
02:05:09,573 --> 02:05:12,701
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!

1062
02:05:18,883 --> 02:05:20,942
Speech! Speech!

1063
02:05:26,824 --> 02:05:32,126
Fellow Scots, if these shouts of yours
express some pleasure

1064
02:05:32,196 --> 02:05:35,927
that we've returned alive, I thank you deeply.

1065
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,960
However, if they're meant as praise
for a successful scientist,

1066
02:05:41,038 --> 02:05:43,700
I must disclaim that honor.

1067
02:05:46,610 --> 02:05:51,638
No. A scientist who cannot prove what he has
accomplished has accomplished nothing.

1068
02:05:51,749 --> 02:05:54,582
I have no records, no shred of evidence.

1069
02:05:54,652 --> 02:06:00,420
I will never embarrass this distinguished
university by asking that it take my word.

1070
02:06:00,524 --> 02:06:02,788
Let me say only this.

1071
02:06:02,893 --> 02:06:09,298
300 years ago a daring man undertook
a perilous journey and never came back.

1072
02:06:09,366 --> 02:06:12,961
We followed his path and returned,
by the grace of God -

1073
02:06:13,070 --> 02:06:15,095
and a heathen altar stone.

1074
02:06:15,172 --> 02:06:18,266
One day someone else -

1075
02:06:18,342 --> 02:06:22,403
it may be you, my boy,
or your sons or your grandsons -

1076
02:06:22,513 --> 02:06:24,947
will pick up where we left off.

1077
02:06:25,015 --> 02:06:29,384
This, I know: The spirit of man
cannot be stopped.

1078
02:06:36,327 --> 02:06:38,761
Splendid, Oliver. Splendid speech.

1079
02:06:38,829 --> 02:06:42,765
Professor, here's someone
who wants to say goodbye.

1080
02:06:42,833 --> 02:06:45,165
His ship sails at four.

1081
02:06:45,235 --> 02:06:48,830
Hans, old friend.
We never could have done without you.

1082
02:06:48,939 --> 02:06:51,134
He has a speech.

1083
02:06:53,377 --> 02:06:59,247
If you... if you will ever
go down there again,

1084
02:06:59,350 --> 02:07:02,376
the center earth, Hans will go too.

1085
02:07:03,754 --> 02:07:04,778
Thank you.

1086
02:07:05,956 --> 02:07:09,892
Did you get your injuries when
the volcano blew up, in the hot lava?

1087
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:11,985
No, it happened at our wedding.

1088
02:07:12,096 --> 02:07:16,897
He was in such a hurry leaving the church,
he fell all the way down the steps.

1089
02:07:16,967 --> 02:07:20,733
You poor wee bride. After all that waiting.

1090
02:07:20,804 --> 02:07:23,295
It's been no marriage for you at all.

1091
02:07:23,374 --> 02:07:25,467
You underestimate Alec.

1092
02:07:28,212 --> 02:07:31,909
I'm taking the night train to London
and then back to Stockholm.

1093
02:07:32,016 --> 02:07:34,917
Stockholm? But you have ajob
to do here in Edinburgh.

1094
02:07:34,985 --> 02:07:37,180
- I?
- I intend to write my memoirs.

1095
02:07:37,287 --> 02:07:40,085
I can't remember
everything that happened alone.

1096
02:07:40,157 --> 02:07:46,289
Oh, I see. What you need is a widow
who can jog your memory and take dictation.

1097
02:07:46,363 --> 02:07:50,390
I suppose I'm to report every day
from nine till twelve, from two to six?

1098
02:07:50,501 --> 02:07:54,232
No, none of that nonsense.
You can stay in my house.

1099
02:07:54,338 --> 02:07:56,499
And what would Edinburgh say?

1100
02:07:56,573 --> 02:08:00,976
It's one thing to spend one's days
and nights with a man under the earth,

1101
02:08:01,078 --> 02:08:03,911
another under one roof in Scotland.

1102
02:08:03,981 --> 02:08:06,347
Well, uh... what do you propose?

1103
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:10,386
That's not a word I'd bandy about, Professor.

1104
02:08:10,788 --> 02:08:12,915
What did I say? Which word?

1105
02:08:13,757 --> 02:08:16,692
I thought it would catch in your throat.

1106
02:08:18,929 --> 02:08:21,261
Madam. Madam.

1107
02:08:21,331 --> 02:08:24,732
Thank you. Madam Goetaborg.
Frau Goetaborg!

1108
02:08:24,802 --> 02:08:26,895
Carla!

1109
02:08:28,172 --> 02:08:30,163
Yes... Oliver?

1110
02:08:30,274 --> 02:08:31,969
Carla...

1111
02:08:34,344 --> 02:08:36,312
I warn you...

1112
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:38,507
I'm wearing stays again.

1113
02:08:40,784 --> 02:08:44,982
# Here's to the prof of geology

1114
02:08:45,089 --> 02:08:49,355
# Master of all natural history

1115
02:08:49,893 --> 02:08:54,227
# Rare boy he, and rare boys we

1116
02:08:54,331 --> 02:08:58,427
# To know such a big curiosity

1117
02:08:58,802 --> 02:09:00,963
# To the braw, aye, aye, aye, aye

1118
02:09:01,038 --> 02:09:03,268
# To the bricht, aye, aye, aye, aye

1119
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:07,037
# To the knicht, aye, aye, aye, aye,
aye, aye, aye, aye

1120
02:09:07,111 --> 02:09:09,170
# Hey

1121
02:09:10,279 --> 02:15:00,645
