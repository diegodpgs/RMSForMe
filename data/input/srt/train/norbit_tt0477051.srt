1
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:42,014
Everyone has their path in life,

2
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:44,599
and this is more or less
where mine started.

3
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:48,927
My name is Norbit Albert Rice,
and I was an orphan.

4
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:56,022
I like to think my parents
loved me very much,

5
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:58,648
but just didn't have the means
to properly care for me.

6
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:01,751
I can see them researching
all of the orphanages in the area,

7
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:03,677
agonizing over their choices,

8
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:05,945
trying to make sure
their precious little boy

9
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:08,830
was raised in the perfect environment.

10
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:26,590
Ling Ling! Someone left another one!

11
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,198
Coyotes, go! Get! Back! Back, coyotes!

12
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:34,071
Get out here! You not eat another baby.

13
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,502
Oh, crap. Another black one.

14
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,028
Can't give these away.

15
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,573
You ugly black one, too.
You be here long time.

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,996
Nobody ever come and say,
"Give me the ugly, black one."

17
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:59,159
You very ugly baby.
The ugliest baby I ever seen.

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,170
A lot of people think
that orphanages are cold and scary,

19
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,891
but the Golden Wonton
was a great place to grow up.

20
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:08,538
We had everything
normal children had. Pets...

21
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:11,609
Here. Play with that.

22
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,851
...a big backyard,
and lots of kids to play with.

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,404
Ling Ling!
The children got in MSG barrel.

24
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:23,392
Now all their hair gonna fall out again.

25
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,587
You stupid orphan!
Nobody want a bald orphan!

26
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,110
Norbit, how you find family with no hair?

27
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:31,103
Nobody want a bald Norbit!

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,404
What the hell wrong
with the children here?

29
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,773
Mr. Wong was a very interesting man.

30
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:39,832
In addition to his love for children
and preparation of fine Asian cuisine,

31
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:42,805
he had a real passion
for oldtime whaling.

32
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,799
It's a whale, ho!

33
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:49,659
Die, you sonofa!

34
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:54,165
Bingo! Right in the blow hole!

35
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,987
Norbit, where you go?
Why you run off like little bitch?

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,338
After Marvin Browning got lost
downtown for a couple of weeks,

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,512
the orphanage started using
a buddy system.

38
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:08,597
Go, Norbit!

39
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:10,558
My buddy was little Kate.

40
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:13,884
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

41
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,870
That's okay. You're doing good.

42
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:27,220
Kate and I were always together.
Playing checkers...

43
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:29,789
Oh, man.
Yes!

44
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:34,166
...watching scary movies.

45
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:39,479
Why, we even pooped together.

46
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:44,798
And then one day, Kate and I decided
that we should tie the knot.

47
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:47,613
We got married
under the great big oak tree.

48
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:50,045
I now pronounce you my wife.

49
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,551
And I pronounce you my husband.

50
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:57,245
It's watermelon.

51
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,325
Yours is green apple.

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,927
I think it's time for us to kiss now.

53
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:13,527
And we lived happily ever after

54
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:18,618
for about two weeks
until she got adopted.

55
00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:24,312
Bye, Norbit.

56
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,181
I didn't do too much bike riding
after that.

57
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:33,437
When Kate left, there was an
odd number of kids at the orphanage,

58
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:36,350
so I was buddyless for a while.

59
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:40,153
And sometimes I'd get a little sad,

60
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:47,163
but I never lost hope.

61
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:51,352
I knew that someday I'd find
another somebody to share my life with.

62
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:54,618
All I had to do was just be patient.

63
00:04:57,662 --> 00:05:00,346
What'd you do that for?
Because we felt like it.

64
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:02,747
What are you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do about it?

65
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:03,774
Loser.

66
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,417
Stop it.

67
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,485
Leave him alone.

68
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,438
Says who?
Says who?

69
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:23,965
Who are you?
Rasputia. What's your name?

70
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:28,597
Norbit.
Norbit? That's a stupid name.

71
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:32,026
Why'd you beat those boys up?
To protect you.

72
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:35,770
You got a girlfriend, Nesbit?
Norbit.

73
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:37,657
No.

74
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,555
Well, you do now.
Get your ass up and hold my hand.

75
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:44,572
Okay.
How you doing?

76
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:49,240
Everything changed
once I had Rasputia as my girlfriend.

77
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,343
We took care of each other,

78
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,830
and the other kids
started to respect me.

79
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,429
I'll take...

80
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,965
Norbit.
Come on.

81
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:12,029
And because of Rasputia,
for the first time in my life,

82
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:15,062
I had a real family.

83
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,271
Rasputia had three brothers.

84
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,764
Big Black Jack. He was the oldest.

85
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:20,982
Leg.

86
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:25,181
Then, there was Blue.

87
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:27,572
Breasts.

88
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:31,418
And Earl. He was the baby.

89
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,729
Wing.

90
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,899
They sure loved their little sister,

91
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:38,201
and so they treated me
like one of their own.

92
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:41,052
Here you go, Norbit.
Saved the best piece for you.

93
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:44,987
What's that?
Turkey ass. Eat up, sucker.

94
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,728
Bon appetitty.

95
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:50,900
Bon appetitty.

96
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:53,435
The Latimores had a reputation

97
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:56,348
for being the meanest,
nastiest people in town,

98
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:58,999
but that's just because
folks didn't know them.

99
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:01,655
They were actually
very nice, hardworking people.

100
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,828
They ran
the local construction company,

101
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:07,831
and recently, responding to the needs
of the community...

102
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:08,884
Yo, Morris.

103
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:11,674
...had opened a little security business.

104
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,483
It was a surprisingly popular service
among the local vendors.

105
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,161
Hey, you don't shake me down.
I'm Italian. I shake you down.

106
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:20,724
Is that right?
Yes.

107
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,490
Get his ass in here.

108
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,582
I'm in.

109
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,924
As time passed,
Rasputia and I got closer and closer,

110
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,563
in high school and as adults.

111
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,175
I started working as a bookkeeper
in her family's business.

112
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,694
I'm expecting
some important calls today, Norbit,

113
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,357
so when you answer the phone,
try and sound white.

114
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:51,924
So when you answer the phone,
try and sound white.

115
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:54,550
It was like everything was
finally coming together.

116
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:55,581
Yes.

117
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:59,320
Of course,
it was only natural that Rasputia and I

118
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,910
would take the next step
in our relationship.

119
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,397
I now pronounce you man and wife.

120
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,492
You may kiss the bride.

121
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:35,254
Open your mouth.

122
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,699
Go, Rasputia!

123
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:49,363
It was a storybook wedding,

124
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,089
the beginning of a brandnew chapter.

125
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:58,270
I knew I would never be lonely again.
I had found my place in the world.

126
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:01,238
Poor Norbit. Man.

127
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:04,670
Back when I was in the game,
I used to tell my hos,

128
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,273
"Hos, ain't no man gonna pay for
the cow if he can get the milk for free."

129
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:11,708
You ain't got to worry
about this brother buying the milk,

130
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:14,489
'cause he just bought
the whole damn cow.

131
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,348
That's a special cow, too.

132
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:18,170
That must be
where buttermilk come from.

133
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:19,765
Sing that shit, girl.

134
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,618
Them are not dimples.
Them are potholes in her ass.

135
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,923
Look like an Escalade
in a wedding dress.

136
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,357
It a horror show.

137
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:34,619
Norbit. What a woman you got.

138
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,574
Hi, fellows.
We're all jealous, right, boys?

139
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:40,019
Oh, yeah. Way jealous.
Wish I had one like that.

140
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:42,941
Norbit, let me talk to you for a second.

141
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:46,261
Look, just so we clear.

142
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,579
If you ever hurt my sister in any way,

143
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:56,217
make her cry,
even make her sad one time,

144
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,758
I'm coming at you
with razor blades and lemon juice.

145
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,873
You hear me?
Yes.

146
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:04,949
I'm talking pain, boy.

147
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:08,088
Searing, mindnumbing pain.

148
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,598
I understand.

149
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:11,801
You understand me?
Yes, yes, yes.

150
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,147
All right.

151
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:17,403
Welcome to the family.
Thank you.

152
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,213
Somebody is take
a big hunk out of my cake!

153
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:31,768
What y'all looking at?
I ain't had no cake.

154
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,359
You better mind your damn business.

155
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:43,322
Hey, hey! Everyone!

156
00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:45,942
I am Mr. Wong.
I am best man in wedding.

157
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:51,197
I feel it my place to say something,
make a toast to bride and groom,

158
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:54,077
tell story about Norbit.
I like Norbit father.

159
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,695
I raise Norbit. He like my own child.

160
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,060
And I want to say that
I very, very confused, Norbit,

161
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:02,362
that you... You marry Latimore.

162
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:06,106
I don't understand it, because
when you was a little boy, you say,

163
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:11,324
"One day I find the girl of my dreams."
And then you marry a gorilla.

164
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,901
I joke, I joke, I joke.

165
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,861
Why you not know joke
when you hear joke?

166
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,415
Why you wanna make fight at wedding?

167
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,709
Cool off, before I have to
bust somebody ass in here. Okay.

168
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,490
When Norbit just little boy,

169
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:31,676
he like to always
run all over place naked. Always naked.

170
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,248
And Norbit, when he was just little boy,
had a peepee the size of an egg roll.

171
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,440
You know, Norbit.
That's true.

172
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:44,184
And one day, down by creek,
Norbit run around naked

173
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:48,029
and poisonous snake jump up
and bite Norbit right on ass.

174
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:51,710
Very close to hole.

175
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,628
Norbit pass out. I think Norbit is dead.

176
00:11:56,735 --> 00:12:00,695
I go to check the boy pulse.
He still alive. He still alive!

177
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,313
"Okay," I say,
"I must do something to save child."

178
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,357
So, I start to think,

179
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:12,180
"Do I suck poison out of Norbit's ass
or do I let him die?"

180
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,566
I do the most responsible thing.

181
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,499
I say, "Hell to the no!

182
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,428
"Norbit is out of here,

183
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,349
"because it is long time in hell

184
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,676
"before Wong suck poison
out of another man's ass."

185
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,363
But strange, mystical thing
happen, Norbit.

186
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,431
Even though poison is in Norbit,
he not die.

187
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:40,851
Norbit get stronger and stronger.

188
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,182
That why I know, Norbit,
deep down inside, you very, very strong.

189
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,287
You strong like warrior.

190
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,489
That's why I say to you, Norbit,
you can survive anything.

191
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:52,089
Even...

192
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,983
So I say to everyone here, and to Norbit,

193
00:12:57,085 --> 00:13:01,526
I wish you much happiness and peace
and love,

194
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,070
and lots of bananas for your new gorilla.

195
00:13:06,174 --> 00:13:08,988
I only kidding. To Norbit and Rasputia.

196
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,408
Norbit, you know
what would be so romantic?

197
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,404
If you'd carry me over the threshold
like a little chocolate drop.

198
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:22,296
Be delicate, now.

199
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,610
Put your back into it.

200
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:31,959
Come on, now. Be a man.
You ain't no man.

201
00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:34,009
Pathetic.

202
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:41,275
Rasputia, I know we're both nervous
because we've never done this before,

203
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:44,756
but we can take our time, darling.
In sweet time.

204
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:54,042
Rasputia was so full of love.

205
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:57,882
Merry Christmas!

206
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,625
Ho, ho, ho!

207
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:04,147
It was a love that sustained us
through the years.

208
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,300
Halt!

209
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:10,676
187. Officer down.

210
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,886
And it's still going strong.

211
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,283
Happy Presidents' Day!

212
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,929
God bless America.

213
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:25,818
And so, we began our life together,
like any other happily married couple.

214
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:27,574
Morning, Rasputia.

215
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:29,106
"Morning, Rasputia," my ass.

216
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:31,253
I tell you what. You better do something
about that goddamn dog,

217
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:32,469
because I ain't gonna be
getting terrorized

218
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:33,817
by no dog on my own property.

219
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:36,023
I'm sick of it! I'm gonna go out
and purchase me a pellet rifle!

220
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:37,533
And then I'm gonna give him
something to bark about

221
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,045
when I start popping pellets
in his little bugeyed bastard's ass.

222
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,425
Messing around with you,
now I'm gonna be late for dance class.

223
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:52,404
God damn it, Norbit.

224
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:55,378
How many times I got to tell you, when
you drive my car, don't adjust my seat!

225
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:58,747
I haven't touched your seat.
Then why is it up so damn far?

226
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:01,911
It looks like it's back
as far as it goes, Rasputia.

227
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,483
No, you moved it. I can tell, 'cause look,

228
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:06,396
when I inhale,
my titty make the horn honk. Listen.

229
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:07,704
You see that?

230
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,385
That ain't right.
I hear it.

231
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:14,454
That scientifically prove
that you was adjusting my seat.

232
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:16,566
That's not science.
It is. Now just let it go.

233
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,971
It's not science.
I said let it go.

234
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,655
I'm just...
I said it was science, God damn it.

235
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:30,770
Why you think I want to sell
Golden Wonton Restaurant?

236
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:32,023
I got a good business.

237
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:34,547
It practically run itself.
I make a lot of money here.

238
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:40,665
Every man got a price.
We think this might be yours.

239
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,173
And here is my counteroffer.

240
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:07,830
Excuse me.
All right, it's go time.

241
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:15,384
I not like rest of town people.
I not intimidated by Latimore.

242
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:19,129
You wrong, Wong. Relax, man.
Be cool with that thing, Mr. Wong.

243
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,855
Ling Ling, get my pistol!

244
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,893
That dude is crazy.
Let's get the hell out of here!

245
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:27,414
I never sell to Latimore! Ever! Ever!

246
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:33,210
All right! Y'all ready, class?
Are y'all ready?

247
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,756
We gonna perforate!
We gonna penetrate!

248
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:38,329
We gonna percolate!

249
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:40,122
We gonna palpitate!

250
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:45,270
All because we wanna master the bate,
the art of powertap the fat.

251
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,478
Come on, and powertap the fat.
Take that, powertap the fat.

252
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,330
Hey, you get your skinny ass
out of my way.

253
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,048
One, two, three, four.
I stepped in poo, better wipe it off.

254
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,150
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

255
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:59,766
I stepped in poo, better wipe it off.
One, two, three, four.

256
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,772
Ride the horse. Ride the horse!

257
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,738
Keep bucking, y'all!
Keep bucking! And slide!

258
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,864
Click clackety clack! Come on, slide!
Click clackety clack! Just slide!

259
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:15,226
Here come the cops.
Here come the cops.

260
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,489
They take me to jail.
They take me to jail.

261
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,785
Riverdance. Come on, white people.
Riverdance. Come on, white people.

262
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:23,544
Riverdance. Come on.

263
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:25,435
Now, pump, pump, pump, pump,
pump me up.

264
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,061
Pump, pump, pump, pump,
pump me down.

265
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:32,468
And one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

266
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:35,705
And stretch it out.
Work your whole bicuspids area,

267
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:39,515
your whole bilaterals and bisexuals.
Very good.

268
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:40,923
Excuse me, Buster?

269
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,583
I think I need
a little adjustment over here.

270
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,726
Look at you,
looking like the Great Pumpkin, girl.

271
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,554
Trick or treat. What's going on?

272
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:49,753
Well, see, I was born with a trick hip
and it made me real bendy.

273
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:52,242
See, I'm just like licorice. Look.

274
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:55,539
Goddamn, girl,
that look like the harvest moon.

275
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:58,744
Turn a brother to a werewolf.
You just need to stop.

276
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,977
You know what?
Do you do any private lessons?

277
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:05,944
I could do private lessons
if you could do me a little favor.

278
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,060
What's that?

279
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,606
Just need you talk to your little brothers
about funding my little video tape.

280
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,401
I'm trying to make powertap
more international.

281
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,996
I'm trying to be like Billy Blanks,

282
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:16,629
but double the money
and half the Blank.

283
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,358
That's a good idea.

284
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,423
Maybe I will, maybe I will.
But, first, I got to get that private lesson.

285
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:24,533
Okay. Call me, girl.

286
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,485
I'll call you.
I'll be your private dancer.

287
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:32,920
Must be Saturday.
Why is that?

288
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,700
Because here come Norbit,
right on schedule.

289
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:38,581
Almost set your watch to him.

290
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,870
Hey, Pope Sweet Jesus
and Lord Have Mercy.

291
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:44,118
How you guys doing, fellows?

292
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,203
Business is good.

293
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,731
Business is good.
It's almost like the good old days.

294
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:48,765
Yes, indeedy.

295
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,072
What do you mean,
"the good old days"?

296
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:52,628
The good old days, man,
back when we was pimping, Norbit.

297
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:53,681
You know.

298
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:55,031
You guys used to pimp?
"Used to"?

299
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:58,297
That's a violation. Still pimping.
Once a pimp, always a pimp.

300
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,471
Always. Forever.
Boss player.

301
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,684
Rasputia sent me down here
to get the usual.

302
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:03,763
You guys are open, right?

303
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:05,811
We always open.
Go on and take yourself in there, Norbit.

304
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:07,062
We'll stack that up for you.

305
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,959
Moniqua!
Yes, Daddy.

306
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,376
Can you get King Kong
three large buckets, extra sauce?

307
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:16,915
Please don't trim the fat.
Yes, Daddy.

308
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:19,127
Please don't trim that fat.
She will kill me.

309
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:20,691
Norbit, while I got your attention,

310
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,897
can I interest you in some new shoes,
maybe a haircut?

311
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,884
How about a bath or a sink?

312
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,534
Hey, don't tell me
you guys bought the bath store, too?

313
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:30,873
It's a perfect fit, man.
We used to sell bitches to johns.

314
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:33,340
Now we selling johns to bitches.

315
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:36,503
Beds, bitches, and beyond!
Sound like money to me.

316
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:37,588
No, thanks, guys.

317
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:39,799
I got to go do a puppet show
for the kids at the orphanage.

318
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:40,829
At the orphanage?

319
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:43,097
That's a nice thing you do
for them little kids over there.

320
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:44,658
Why don't you take
these little tater puffs

321
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:45,975
over there to them little children?

322
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:48,727
Oh, that's great, guys. That's sweet.

323
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,382
Wait, my puppets! I forgot my puppets!

324
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:52,892
I got to go. I got to go, guys.

325
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:54,778
Where's his puppets?
He ain't got no puppets.

326
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,160
What's Rasputia doing home so early?

327
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:07,162
'Sputia?

328
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:12,435
Oh, yeah, girl.

329
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,069
Come on, girl, that's sweet chocolate!

330
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:16,694
Okay, you in trouble, now.
You in trouble. You in trouble, now.

331
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,929
I'm Willy Wonka.
Get up on that Oompa Loompa.

332
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:27,067
That's sweet. Oh, yeah.
Take all that, girl.

333
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:29,750
Take it with your big old self, girl.
You ain't never had it like this.

334
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,993
You ain't never had it like this!

335
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:33,751
Hell, yeah.
Come on, we gonna do pig in a blanket.

336
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:35,163
Come on, pig in a blanket.

337
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,783
Now squeal. Squeal! Squeal!
Oink, oink, oink!

338
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:38,900
Take it from the back.

339
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:42,584
Damn, I feel like Willy Wonka,
all this sweet chocolate up in this...

340
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:48,883
Hey. How you doing, man?
What's good with you, brother?

341
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,030
How's it going, man? How you doing?

342
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:53,077
I'm Bustamove Perkin.
How you doing?

343
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:54,709
Man, your wife was
just talking about you.

344
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:56,440
Man, she love you.

345
00:20:56,542 --> 00:21:01,494
You're Rasputia's tap dance teacher.
Man, actually, I'm her powertap guru.

346
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:04,118
I was just here
giving her a little tap lesson.

347
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,847
But you're naked.

348
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:08,378
That's just so she could see
the various muscle groups

349
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,754
as I go through the various routines.

350
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:13,301
You see that there?
You can't see that with a turtleneck.

351
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,307
And you have an...

352
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:19,348
Oh, man,
I'm just real passionate about dance.

353
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:22,006
You can say the word "dance"
and he just jump up. Dance!

354
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:23,767
See that? See that there?

355
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,076
'Sputia?

356
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:27,090
Norbit, Buster's a guest in our home.

357
00:21:27,197 --> 00:21:28,791
How dare you insinuate
something like that?

358
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:30,387
Yeah, Orbit!

359
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:33,625
How dare you insinuate
something such like that!

360
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:38,264
You know, I am actually offended
by your accusization, you understand?

361
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,593
And rather than sit here and have
a belligerent confrontation with you,

362
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:44,059
'cause I am a Godfearing man,

363
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:48,347
I'm'a do like Jesus H. Christ
would do in a situation such as such

364
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:51,128
and I'm gonna turn the other cheek.

365
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:52,472
Amen.

366
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:58,833
You happy now?

367
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:00,829
Rasputia, you cheated on me!

368
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:02,485
Look, I told your ass
ain't nothing happened,

369
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:03,602
and the next time you say
it happened again,

370
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,044
I'm gonna knock your teeth
out your mouth.

371
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:09,077
Rasputia, we took vows.
I'm your husband.

372
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:13,400
Rasputia, we took vows,
and you cheated on me!

373
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:15,513
It never happened!

374
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,548
Yes, it did!

375
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:22,546
And that makes you
the queen of whores!

376
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,212
Hey, Norbit!

377
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:37,907
Run for your lives!

378
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,103
Bastard! Come here!

379
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:46,810
Oh, sweet Moses! Oh, my God!

380
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,178
Come here! Come here!
Come here to me!

381
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:50,390
No! Leave me alone!

382
00:22:50,493 --> 00:22:52,054
You ain't nothing
but a goddamn coward!

383
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:53,465
Saddle tramp!

384
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,240
That's what your stupid black ass get!

385
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,349
I hope you broke your ass!

386
00:23:04,988 --> 00:23:06,483
Since you feel like running, Norbit,

387
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:09,307
why don't you run your ass
down to the Rib Shak

388
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,708
and get me a short stack of ribs?

389
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,504
And get me a short stack of ribs?

390
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:15,061
Extra hot sauce.

391
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:18,426
All this setting you straight
done got me famished.

392
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:28,020
I'm Little Red Riding Goose,

393
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,643
walking through the forest,
minding my own business,

394
00:23:30,748 --> 00:23:32,537
when all at once...

395
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:33,715
Hello.

396
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:37,333
Who are you?
I'm the big, bad pig of the forest.

397
00:23:37,435 --> 00:23:40,087
My, what big eyes you have, Pig.

398
00:23:40,188 --> 00:23:42,098
The better to see you with, Goose.

399
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:45,335
And my, what a big nose you have, Pig.

400
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:48,917
The better to smell them scrumptious
goodies you got in your basket.

401
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,540
Hey, let me take a look in there.

402
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:55,637
Oh, no, you don't.
You're gonna try to steal my food.

403
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,114
No, I won't steal your food.

404
00:23:57,212 --> 00:23:59,897
Don't let that pig
push you around, Goose.

405
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:02,997
Yeah, I'm tired of
you pushing me around.

406
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,075
Look, I'm tired of
playing with your ass, bitch.

407
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:06,708
I know you got ribs in that basket.

408
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,121
You better give them up smooth

409
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:10,554
or I'm gonna break my hoof off
in your goose ass.

410
00:24:10,652 --> 00:24:13,302
Oh, really? Well, why don't you get up
off of your lazy behind

411
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:15,443
and go down to the Rib Shak
and get your own ribs?

412
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:18,068
Or better still,
why don't you just call Buster

413
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:20,180
and tell him to come over
and powertap you,

414
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,324
because in addition to being
the pig of the forest,

415
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:25,112
you're also a saddle tramp,
whore, bitch pig...

416
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:29,174
Norbit! What you doing?
This supposed to be a children's show.

417
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:33,138
This remind me
of Chinese snuff film I once costar in.

418
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:36,540
I'm sorry. I got a little carried away.

419
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:39,581
Wow, Norbit,
that was some puppet show.

420
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:44,922
Oh, come on. You don't remember me?

421
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:49,938
Kate. Kate.
Come here!

422
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:53,360
Kate! Kate! Oh, God!
I can't believe it! Kate!

423
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,636
Well, can I have a hug?

424
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,825
Norbit.

425
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,444
It just like old times.

426
00:25:03,548 --> 00:25:06,134
Maybe you two go take poop together.

427
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:14,581
This place has not changed at all.

428
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:18,296
Oh, yeah. Some of this furniture's
even come back in style.

429
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,568
So, how long are
you gonna be visiting for?

430
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:22,806
No, I'm not visiting. I'm moving back.

431
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:25,626
Really? Wow.

432
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,309
I sold my clothing business in Atlanta,

433
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:31,477
and I'm going to use the money
to buy the orphanage.

434
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,955
What?

435
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,820
Mr. Wong's getting older.
He wants to go whaling, so...

436
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:42,131
You know, it's always been my dream
to come back here and take over.

437
00:25:42,397 --> 00:25:44,152
That's great.

438
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:47,196
Norbit, look.

439
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:51,575
That's the tree we got married under.

440
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:56,147
You know, I've still got my ring.

441
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:58,808
I ate mine.

442
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:02,899
I missed you so much when you left.

443
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,879
I missed you, too.

444
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:09,779
That's my car.

445
00:26:10,814 --> 00:26:13,912
We didn't really get a chance
to catch up much.

446
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:18,266
I'll be back in town on Tuesday.
You wanna have lunch?

447
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:21,269
Yeah, I would love to
have lunch on Tuesday.

448
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,550
I love lunch.
Okay.

449
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:26,231
Lunch, yes. For sure.
I love lunch. Tuesday.

450
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:27,699
I'll see you Tuesday.

451
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:31,253
I'll see you on Tuesday.
We'll have lunch on Tuesday.

452
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,651
Tuesday.

453
00:26:34,077 --> 00:26:36,663
Tuesday. Tuesday.

454
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:40,277
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday.

455
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,152
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday...

456
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:47,897
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday...

457
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:55,411
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

458
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:58,550
Tuesday, Tuesday...

459
00:26:58,653 --> 00:27:02,427
Say "Tuesday" again
and you ain't gonna see Wednesday!

460
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:04,564
I got it. I'll get it. Tuesday.

461
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:07,864
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

462
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:10,489
Buster. How you doing? You look great.
Hey.

463
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,663
Oh, thank you, man.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

464
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:14,674
Thank you.
I thought you were gonna be at work.

465
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:15,991
Yeah, I'm on my way out now.

466
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,165
But hey, look,
there's cold beer in the refrigerator

467
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,308
and there's fresh sheets on the bed.
Go have a great dance lesson.

468
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:21,524
All right.
All right.

469
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:22,806
Powertap.

470
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:25,592
Very good, very good.

471
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:28,925
Tuesday.

472
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:34,386
What's wrong with your boy?
He real cool all of a sudden.

473
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:38,169
Yeah, I don't know what the hell got
into him, but I know I got dance fever.

474
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:40,636
Ready for a little powertap, huh?

475
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:43,736
Lord, give me strength.

476
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:45,972
Hey, Sam, happy Tuesday.

477
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,189
Norbit.

478
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:48,373
Norbit.

479
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:51,228
Hey, Kate. Hi.
Come on, I got us a table.

480
00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:52,950
Great. I've been looking forward to this
all week.

481
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:54,459
Good.

482
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:56,116
Hey.

483
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:57,747
Hey. Who's he?

484
00:27:57,853 --> 00:27:59,827
Norbit, this is my fianc¨¦, Deion Hughes.

485
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:02,803
How you doing, my man?
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

486
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:04,949
This is your fianc¨¦?
Yes, sir.

487
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:07,771
I was just telling Deion that you and I
were buddy partners at the orphanage.

488
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:09,723
Now she and I are buddy partners.

489
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,596
Shame on you, man,
letting a girl go like this. I feel for you.

490
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,060
And so Deion's got all this experience
in real estate,

491
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:18,972
so he's going to help me buy
the orphanage, Norbit. It's so exciting!

492
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,726
No, wait, wait. No, no.
Slow down, slow down.

493
00:28:20,828 --> 00:28:23,382
I mean, you know,
we're just out here just scouting it out.

494
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:25,461
All right? This is her nest egg,
you know.

495
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:27,159
I don't want her
making any hasty decisions

496
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:28,985
that she might regret later, you know?

497
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:31,506
She worked too hard for this money,
man, you know what I mean?

498
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:34,034
Deion, you take
such good care of me, baby.

499
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,694
It's my job. Stop it.

500
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:38,745
Okay?

501
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:45,745
Don't you just love Tuesdays?

502
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:54,449
Lloyd, just tell me why it has to hurt
so GD much.

503
00:28:58,812 --> 00:29:00,242
What's the matter, boy?

504
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:04,243
You sensing an earthquake
or some other sort of natural disaster?

505
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,256
That's just my...

506
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,111
My wife.

507
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,013
A man needs his own space.

508
00:29:34,332 --> 00:29:37,846
Finally! For the love of Cain.

509
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,988
Moses!

510
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,082
I'll see you suckers
tomorrow at the picnic!

511
00:30:03,643 --> 00:30:05,530
Damn it, Norbit!
How many times I got to tell you,

512
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:06,904
don't be messing with my car seat!

513
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,791
Nobody touched your old, stupid seat.

514
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,121
Then how come
it's all mushed up like this, then?

515
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,106
Well, you know, Rasputia,
you've been eating so much lately

516
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:18,612
there's a very strong possibility that...
The car is shrinking.

517
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,585
Might be shrinking.
The car is being smaller.

518
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:26,197
Yeah, you might be right. Been raining
a lot lately. All this moist weather.

519
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:29,682
Oh, yeah? That'll make it shrink.
This weather's so moist.

520
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:37,396
How you doing?

521
00:30:41,627 --> 00:30:44,857
Don't cha wish your girlfriend
was hot like me

522
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:47,638
Don't cha wish your girlfriend
was a freak like me

523
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:49,367
Don't cha

524
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:53,339
Look at that dog over there,
eyeballing me.

525
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:56,022
Rasputia, what are you doing?

526
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,335
Shut up!

527
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:01,461
Hey, slow down! You're gonna hit him!
I got you now. I got you now!

528
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:06,257
Stop it! No!
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

529
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:09,396
Rasputia, don't! No! No! No!

530
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:16,956
I know what that sound means!

531
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:17,370
I know what that sound means!

532
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:19,606
Bark! How you doing!

533
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,853
Lloyd!

534
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:23,923
Enough is enough.

535
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:26,929
Now, where in the hell
do you think you're going?

536
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:28,820
Lloyd's in the hospital because of you!

537
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:30,867
Yeah, that's right.
I put his little dog ass in the hospital.

538
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,460
And I'd have put it in the morgue, too,
if you didn't mess with my car seat.

539
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:34,906
It threw off my driving skills.

540
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:41,265
Rasputia, you are a mean, selfish, cold,
heartless woman, and I am leaving you!

541
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:43,377
You leaving me?
Yes!

542
00:31:44,123 --> 00:31:45,781
Well, where the hell
you think you're going, big shot?

543
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:47,541
You ain't got no money.
You ain't got no family.

544
00:31:47,643 --> 00:31:49,171
Everything is in my name, the car,
the house...

545
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,665
You ain't nothing and you ain't gonna
never be nothing without me, Norbit!

546
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:55,546
Norbit, you just can't leave!
Norbit, please, I'm with child!

547
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,444
With child?

548
00:31:59,548 --> 00:32:03,803
Oh, yes, Norbit, can't you tell?
I'm getting a little belly.

549
00:32:04,828 --> 00:32:07,730
And my titties is all achy and itchylike.

550
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:11,033
Oh, Norbit, we gonna be a family.

551
00:32:12,156 --> 00:32:17,589
Oh, Norbit, come hug me,
Daddy, please.

552
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:22,136
Please, Norbit.

553
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,226
I understand, little pony.

554
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:44,915
I know your pain.

555
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:48,026
Oh, yes, I know.

556
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,018
Excuse me, snow bunny.

557
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:55,385
I don't come in your jurisdiction,
throwing town picnics.

558
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:59,257
Yet here you is all up in mines,
pimping hos.

559
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,921
It's just a kissing booth.

560
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,598
Call it what you will,
but Pope Sweet Jesus

561
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,293
is taking half.

562
00:33:07,676 --> 00:33:09,748
You work for me now, ho.

563
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:12,016
Sure.

564
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,466
Let me taste the goods.

565
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:14,938
Put it on me.

566
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:17,814
Greasy.
Greasy.

567
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:19,672
We back in business.

568
00:33:21,948 --> 00:33:24,884
I wanna be a ho. How do I apply?

569
00:33:25,117 --> 00:33:29,045
Please, Lord Jesus, help me!
Look, look, tickets! Hey, tickets, tickets.

570
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:30,675
Let me go! Let me go!
Line up with your buddy.

571
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,892
Line up with your buddy.

572
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:33,370
You got one, sweetie.
Can we go on the jumper?

573
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:34,416
Yeah, yeah, you go.

574
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:37,371
Baby, you know I love you.
I love these kids.

575
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:39,410
It's just that
I don't think buying an orphanage

576
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:42,483
is the right move financially right now.
That's all.

577
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,563
Hey, this is not
a financial decision, Deion.

578
00:33:44,668 --> 00:33:46,937
I thought you understood that, baby.
No. No, I do. I do, baby.

579
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:49,654
But this the call I was telling you...
The business call, it's very important.

580
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:51,544
Let's talk about it
when I get back to the house, okay?

581
00:33:51,644 --> 00:33:52,822
You're not going to stay?

582
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:55,160
No, very important. Here.

583
00:33:56,508 --> 00:34:00,086
Hello? It's never a bad time for you.

584
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,569
Stop it! Stop!

585
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:04,919
Norbit!

586
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:07,030
Hey.
Hi.

587
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,626
Hey.

588
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:12,308
I didn't know you were gonna be here.
Oh, yeah.

589
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,647
Hey, you know, I just saw Deion leaving.

590
00:34:15,131 --> 00:34:17,912
He had some business to take care of.

591
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,916
So, who are you here with?

592
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:23,089
My wife.

593
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:29,845
Norbit, I didn't know you were married.
Yeah.

594
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:33,809
Well, that's wonderful. Really.
Thank you so much.

595
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:35,508
So, where is she?

596
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:39,513
Right over there in the print outfit.

597
00:34:39,612 --> 00:34:42,427
The one talking to the girl by the bench?

598
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:46,102
No, the one sucking the jelly
out of them donuts.

599
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:52,601
Oh, yeah. She's pretty.

600
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:55,605
That's cherry.
Is that cherry or strawberry?

601
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:58,129
What are my kids doing? Peter! Theo!

602
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:00,505
I don't want you bothering anyone.

603
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:03,227
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Rice.

604
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:05,428
Mrs. Rice?
My name ain't no damn Mrs. Rice.

605
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:07,833
Oh, I just thought
'cause you're married to Norbit...

606
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:09,011
Who the hell are you?

607
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:12,050
Kate, this is my wife,
Rasputia Latimore,

608
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:13,497
and, Rasputia, this is Kate.

609
00:35:14,043 --> 00:35:16,183
Nice to meet you.
Hello.

610
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,422
Kate's an old friend of mine
from the orphanage.

611
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:21,142
Latimore, as in Latimore Construction?

612
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,001
Yes, that's right,
as in Latimore Construction.

613
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,310
That's right. Why?

614
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,720
Well, just that this is perfect,

615
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:29,168
'cause I was going to come see
you guys about a renovation of...

616
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:30,809
I ain't come out here for that.

617
00:35:30,906 --> 00:35:33,143
I'm out here to enjoy these festivities,
not to be talking no business.

618
00:35:33,243 --> 00:35:34,673
You wanna talk business,
my brother is Big Black Jack

619
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,707
over there by the BB guns.

620
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,461
Go over there and talk to him.
I ain't got no time for this.

621
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:39,255
Oh, sure, okay.

622
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:41,013
Well, go on, get.

623
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,733
Okay.
Okay.

624
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:50,485
Come here.
What, Rasputia?

625
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:52,955
You thinking about creeping, ain't you?

626
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:54,099
We're just friends.

627
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:56,790
What'd I tell you about having friends?

628
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:58,353
Go over there
and get me another wine cooler.

629
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,631
It's hot as hell out here.
Don't you see I'm sweltering?

630
00:36:00,732 --> 00:36:04,178
Rasputia, you can't drink wine.
Why the hell not?

631
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:08,761
You're with child.
With child? I ain't with no...

632
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:13,658
Oh, that was... I had gas. I still got it.

633
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:18,672
There's your child.
Now, go get me something to drink.

634
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:28,023
Twins!

635
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:30,293
Hey! You come back here!

636
00:36:32,188 --> 00:36:34,261
Oh, my God!
Move your fat ass, boy.

637
00:36:36,284 --> 00:36:38,422
Look, you got one!

638
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:41,818
Get him. Get him, Big Black.

639
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:45,786
Are you Big Black Jack?

640
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:47,699
What it look like?

641
00:36:47,803 --> 00:36:50,072
Oh, well.

642
00:36:50,172 --> 00:36:53,172
Me and my fianc¨¦
are buying the Golden Wonton...

643
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:56,472
Wong's place? He's selling it to you?

644
00:36:56,572 --> 00:36:58,994
Yeah. Why is that surprising?

645
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,172
Miss Thomas, Miss Thomas, let's go.
They're starting the music.

646
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:02,683
Oh, great!
Come on. Let's go.

647
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:05,168
Can we finish this up later?
Apparently I have to go dance now.

648
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:07,665
All right, baby. You go dance now.

649
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:11,161
The orphanage is in play.

650
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:16,756
Y'all better give me my hat.
Give me the hat!

651
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,233
Here, take her hat.

652
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:21,907
You think I won't come up in here?
I'm gonna come up in here.

653
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,729
You think I'm playing?

654
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:33,493
Give me the hat right now,
or I'm gonna tear your leg off.

655
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,213
Hey, Norbit, come on!

656
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:39,162
Oh, no. No, I can't.
Rasputia's waiting for me.

657
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,496
Come on, dance with us.
No, really, I shouldn't...

658
00:37:41,596 --> 00:37:45,043
Don't think I won't kill a child.
I'll kill a child in front of everybody.

659
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:46,971
Little street urchins.

660
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:52,208
Okay. That's it.
Now it's time to bring the pain.

661
00:37:59,003 --> 00:38:01,392
Dance, Norbit, dance! Come on!

662
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,060
My hat!

663
00:38:11,612 --> 00:38:13,106
It's raining little white women.

664
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:15,034
My prayers have been answered!

665
00:38:15,132 --> 00:38:18,067
She'd better move,
'cause my prayer is for a Cadillac.

666
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:30,038
You little bastards.

667
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:35,797
Where the hell is Norbit
with that wine cooler?

668
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:37,621
I'm thirsty as hell.

669
00:38:46,746 --> 00:38:48,175
Oh, hell, no.

670
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:51,698
Oh, he's lost his mind.

671
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:55,632
Bitch, that's my wine cooler!

672
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:58,804
It's my birthday! It's my birthday!

673
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:01,013
It's your birthday?
You think it's your birthday, huh?

674
00:39:01,116 --> 00:39:03,450
Norbit's got moves, everybody! Yeah!

675
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,848
You got him loose, don't you,
you little skinny bitch?

676
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:08,981
I see what you trying to do.
I see just what you trying to do.

677
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:12,693
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!
Come on, everybody!

678
00:39:12,794 --> 00:39:13,742
Go, Norbit!

679
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,599
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

680
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:18,553
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

681
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,301
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go...

682
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,416
Norbit!

683
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:32,375
Crooked employees?
Unlicensed doctors?

684
00:39:32,473 --> 00:39:34,000
Lipstick on your husband's collar?

685
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:35,699
Find out who you're really dealing with.

686
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:38,223
Send $29.95
to Background Checks by Mail,

687
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,567
P.O. Box 119, Locust Falls.

688
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:41,877
Hey, buddy partner.

689
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:45,721
Hi, Kate. Hi, nice to see you.
How you doing?

690
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:48,754
I'm good, but how about you
and your head?

691
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:50,548
Oh, I'm doing better.

692
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,959
The doctor said if it weren't for
my hard Afro, it could have killed me.

693
00:39:59,354 --> 00:40:02,769
Are you sure you're okay, Norbit?
That sounds kind of fast.

694
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:06,965
Oh, well, they're doing some tests.
They're kind of monitoring me.

695
00:40:08,858 --> 00:40:11,378
Well, I don't know about this stuff,
but 110 beats per minute,

696
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:14,329
that's kind of high. 120...

697
00:40:14,714 --> 00:40:16,755
Oh, my goodness, 130!

698
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:20,154
Yeah, maybe the machine's broke.
I'm just gonna take these off.

699
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:33,041
You Deion Hughes?

700
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:34,455
Who's asking?

701
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:36,463
We the Latimores.

702
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:38,643
Yeah. Latimore Construction.

703
00:40:38,747 --> 00:40:40,339
And we run this town.

704
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:43,606
Your woman was telling us how y'all
was planning on buying the orphanage.

705
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,430
Kate has her plans and I have mine.

706
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:47,864
Well, it looks like the only plans you got,
my man, is leaving.

707
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,718
I ain't sticking around
raising no damn orphans.

708
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:52,055
I got kids of my own
I ain't even bringing up.

709
00:40:52,154 --> 00:40:53,780
So, you was just hustling her?

710
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:56,981
Break it to her gentle for me,
would you? I'm out!

711
00:40:57,723 --> 00:41:00,952
Hold up, player.
I think you missing the flow here.

712
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:03,801
That orphanage she buying,
that's a huge property,

713
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:05,873
outside of town, zoned commercial.

714
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:07,385
Even got a liquor license.

715
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:08,856
Interesting.

716
00:41:08,954 --> 00:41:11,059
It's a perfect place for a titty bar.

717
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:13,623
Did you say "titty bar"?
Titties.

718
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,096
We got it all worked out.

719
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:17,650
We gonna call it Nipplopolis.

720
00:41:17,947 --> 00:41:19,255
Nipplopolis.

721
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,745
Shit got a ring to it, don't it?

722
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:24,564
We talking about overpriced,
watereddown alcohol

723
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:27,449
and fake tig old bitties in abundance.

724
00:41:27,642 --> 00:41:29,169
Ain't gonna be nothing but taxfree,

725
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:31,185
underthetable, pure cash money.
Big time!

726
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,219
That's right.

727
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:36,439
All you got to do is swing us the deal
and we make you partner.

728
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:37,749
And what about Kate?

729
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:41,233
If you marry her,
it's as much yours as hers.

730
00:41:42,106 --> 00:41:46,547
Norbit, I really want you
to be a part of the orphanage.

731
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,821
The kids are crazy about you.

732
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:50,865
They're good kids.
Yeah.

733
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:54,385
You know, I'm gonna take them
bike riding tomorrow, down by the lake.

734
00:41:54,491 --> 00:41:56,346
Why don't you come?

735
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:59,408
I don't know if I could go for a bike ride.

736
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,512
I never... I didn't really know how, the...

737
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:05,750
I can't ride a bike still.

738
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:08,565
You never learned? What?

739
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,609
Well, you left, you know,

740
00:42:10,715 --> 00:42:12,177
and there was nobody
there to teach me.

741
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:14,138
And Wong don't ride.

742
00:42:14,652 --> 00:42:17,553
Okay, we'll do something else.
The water park.

743
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:19,349
The kids have been begging me
to take them there.

744
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:21,075
Oh, I don't know about the water park.

745
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:23,316
Come on, it's a Saturday.
You don't have to work.

746
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:26,679
Yeah, I know, but it's the park
and it's watery,

747
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:32,180
and there's a potential hell to pay
if I were to be there maybe...

748
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:35,539
Hey, what are you doing
with those things, Kate?

749
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:38,609
Well, I'm just going to have to shock you
till you say yes.

750
00:42:38,714 --> 00:42:40,503
Hey, come on, Kate.
Don't play with those.

751
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:43,156
Those things are plugged in. It's hot.
Clear.

752
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:45,527
No, no clear. No clear. Stop, Kate.
Stop, Kate.

753
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:47,254
Come on. Yes.

754
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:50,486
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes! Okay, stop. Nurse!

755
00:43:02,586 --> 00:43:07,191
Oh, my God, Deion. This is beautiful.
I didn't even know you could cook.

756
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:10,387
I just wanted to do something special
for you, you know, from the heart.

757
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:12,345
Well, I am feeling it.

758
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:18,096
Let's do it. Let's get married, right away.
I don't wanna wait.

759
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:22,099
Deion.
Church is free on Saturday.

760
00:43:24,155 --> 00:43:25,682
You're serious?

761
00:43:25,788 --> 00:43:28,787
Baby, we belong together.
Yeah.

762
00:43:29,243 --> 00:43:31,993
I want to. Saturday.
Yeah. Yes!

763
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,628
Thank you.
Oh, no, thank you.

764
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:56,369
Norbit!

765
00:43:56,475 --> 00:43:59,256
Hi. Hey. Good morning, Rasputia.

766
00:43:59,354 --> 00:44:01,941
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

767
00:44:02,044 --> 00:44:03,669
Where the hell you going?

768
00:44:05,596 --> 00:44:08,694
Nowhere special.
I was just gonna go out to...

769
00:44:08,796 --> 00:44:12,090
I was just going over to Raging Waters.
Raging Waters?

770
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:16,048
Yes. It's this thing
I got roped into, darling.

771
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,503
You know, I was at this orphanage
when I was raised, and...

772
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:20,690
And the people from the orphanage

773
00:44:20,795 --> 00:44:22,737
and now they're taking other orphans
to Raging Waters

774
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:24,849
so they asked me to come
and give back to the community,

775
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:27,376
so I'm trying to, you know, do my part.

776
00:44:27,482 --> 00:44:30,134
Little Miss Skinny Bitch gonna be there?

777
00:44:30,618 --> 00:44:32,309
You mean Miss Ling Ling?

778
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,417
You know damn well
I ain't talking about no Miss Ling Ling.

779
00:44:34,522 --> 00:44:36,725
I'm talking about Miss Thing Thing
from that picnic.

780
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:38,255
Miss Thing Thing from the picnic?

781
00:44:38,361 --> 00:44:40,370
Who are you talking about, sweetheart?
I don't even...

782
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:44,534
Wait, I think I remember now.
A girl, she had the foreign name.

783
00:44:49,306 --> 00:44:51,892
Something Russian.
Kate, bitch!

784
00:44:51,994 --> 00:44:54,994
Kate! Of course it's Kate. Yes,
I don't know if Kate's gonna be there.

785
00:44:55,097 --> 00:44:57,748
I hadn't even thought about it.
It didn't even cross my mind.

786
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,982
I wonder, will Kate be there?
Damn good question.

787
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,905
Well, I'm going.

788
00:45:03,003 --> 00:45:04,115
No!

789
00:45:04,794 --> 00:45:05,594
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

790
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:07,317
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

791
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:10,287
Who don't like water parks? I love them.
They're just like amusement parks,

792
00:45:10,393 --> 00:45:12,433
except you ain't got to get off the ride
to go to the bathroom.

793
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:13,782
How you doing?

794
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:17,553
Great.

795
00:45:20,188 --> 00:45:21,812
There you go. Have fun.

796
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:24,729
There you go, Brian.
Nick, there's one for you.

797
00:45:26,394 --> 00:45:29,743
All right, kids, everybody please be nice
to Mrs. Latimore, okay?

798
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:32,151
Okay.
Okay.

799
00:45:32,506 --> 00:45:36,184
Kate, I hope you don't mind.
I asked Rasputia to join us.

800
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:39,315
Of course not.
I'm really glad you could come.

801
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,062
Well, are we gonna stand around here
all day or we gonna go inside?

802
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:44,274
Excuse me.

803
00:45:46,107 --> 00:45:47,830
Excuse me, ma'am.

804
00:45:48,442 --> 00:45:49,718
What?

805
00:45:51,226 --> 00:45:53,201
Are you wearing bottoms?

806
00:45:53,306 --> 00:45:55,608
Of course I'm wearing bottoms!

807
00:45:56,826 --> 00:45:58,769
Okay. Come on in.

808
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:00,850
How dare you?

809
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:08,121
Oh, hell, no.

810
00:46:15,963 --> 00:46:18,450
How you doing!

811
00:46:23,642 --> 00:46:24,722
This ain't like no real beach,

812
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:27,674
'cause on a real beach you got people
walking around with ice chests

813
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:31,032
and you can get all kinds of treats
like sandwiches and potato chips

814
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,644
and Mentos and Skittles
and all sorts of delectables.

815
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:36,405
You can't get shit here!

816
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:39,409
Well, you know,
there's a concession stand.

817
00:46:39,516 --> 00:46:40,759
You going?

818
00:46:41,434 --> 00:46:42,863
No, I already ate.

819
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,075
Well, you could have fooled me.

820
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,192
I'm sorry?

821
00:46:46,297 --> 00:46:49,200
I'm just trying to say
you too damn skinny. Look at you.

822
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,176
See, most men like a woman
that got a little... Or a little...

823
00:46:52,282 --> 00:46:53,973
You ain't got nothing.
You just skin and bones,

824
00:46:54,074 --> 00:46:56,344
just sitting in that chair
all bones and skin.

825
00:46:56,442 --> 00:46:57,936
I feel sorry for you.

826
00:46:58,042 --> 00:47:01,337
Well, I just feel that we're all made
exactly the way we're supposed to be.

827
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:02,743
Oh, no. Hell, no. I'm a Christian,

828
00:47:02,842 --> 00:47:06,158
and you ain't gonna sit there
and blame God for how you look, okay?

829
00:47:06,265 --> 00:47:08,022
You the one that
pushed that plate away.

830
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:10,227
My Norbit is always telling me
there's two kinds of women,

831
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,851
big old good ones
and good old big ones.

832
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:14,382
Really?

833
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:16,694
That's right. And, sister, let me tell you,
just between the two of us,

834
00:47:16,794 --> 00:47:17,842
I can't keep Norbit off me.

835
00:47:17,946 --> 00:47:19,636
He is the biggest freak
you ever wanna meet

836
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,198
and he be blowing my back out,

837
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:23,476
trying to put me
through the headboard every night.

838
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:25,104
I'm thinking about
going on a little diet or something

839
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,834
so I can get
all emaciatedlooking like you,

840
00:47:26,937 --> 00:47:28,213
then he'll think I look disgusting

841
00:47:28,314 --> 00:47:30,202
and I can get a rest
or some sleep for a little while,

842
00:47:30,298 --> 00:47:33,614
because he want it all the time.
Just boom, bam, boom, boom, boom.

843
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:36,057
But I ain't mad at him, hey.

844
00:47:36,154 --> 00:47:37,942
I'm gonna go on a diet for sure,
next week.

845
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:40,595
Right now I'm gonna get me
a lamb kabob and a wine cooler.

846
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:43,829
How you doing?
Where is that wine cooler section?

847
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:48,079
Miss Thomas, we're all going off
the Leap of Doom. Come on.

848
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,519
Slowly. Slowly.
Someone's gonna fall down.

849
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,139
You're gonna break your head in half
in a second. Slow down!

850
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:54,419
Wait for me!

851
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:58,962
I tell you, it sure is tiring chasing these
kids all around the water park, isn't it?

852
00:47:59,065 --> 00:48:01,269
Especially for us skinny folk.

853
00:48:01,368 --> 00:48:02,798
What?

854
00:48:02,905 --> 00:48:04,596
Never mind.

855
00:48:06,202 --> 00:48:09,236
So, Norbit, I have some news.

856
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:12,722
Deion and I
decided to move up the wedding.

857
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:14,418
What wedding?

858
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:16,082
Our wedding.

859
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:19,028
We're going to get married on Saturday.

860
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:22,127
You're getting married on Saturday?

861
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:25,464
Yeah, we just figured, "Why wait?"
You know?

862
00:48:29,403 --> 00:48:33,493
Well... Congratulations, then.

863
00:48:34,169 --> 00:48:35,151
Thanks.

864
00:48:35,257 --> 00:48:36,784
Yeah.
I'm really happy.

865
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:39,157
Oh, so am I. It's wonderful.

866
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:43,476
So, there it is, the Leap of Doom.

867
00:48:43,578 --> 00:48:45,683
Yeah, go and have fun.
I'll wait for you at the bottom.

868
00:48:45,785 --> 00:48:46,713
You go have some fun.

869
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,403
Okay.
Okay.

870
00:48:51,801 --> 00:48:54,038
Okay, kids, one at a time.

871
00:48:57,594 --> 00:48:59,350
I guess this is me.

872
00:49:02,682 --> 00:49:04,919
What are you looking at, Norbit?

873
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:10,480
I was just watching the... Some kids.
They're about to come down the slide.

874
00:49:10,587 --> 00:49:12,822
I wanted to watch
the kids come down safely.

875
00:49:13,081 --> 00:49:14,608
Kids, huh?
Yeah.

876
00:49:14,937 --> 00:49:17,392
So, you wanna watch a bitch
come down a slide?

877
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:19,832
Well, I'm gonna show you
how a bitch come down a slide.

878
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:21,425
Oh, no...

879
00:49:27,386 --> 00:49:31,477
Excuse me, ma'am?
We have a 300pound weight limit.

880
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:39,698
I don't weigh no damn 300 pounds.
I weigh 165. How you doing?

881
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,350
That was awesome.

882
00:49:48,089 --> 00:49:49,615
What's that?

883
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,382
It's Rasputia.

884
00:49:54,968 --> 00:49:58,132
I'm gonna show you
how a bitch go down a slide.

885
00:50:11,737 --> 00:50:13,559
I'm sliding, bitches!

886
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,116
Mary, Mother of God.

887
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:22,357
Slow down! Stop! Stop!

888
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:40,655
How you doing?

889
00:50:47,642 --> 00:50:49,616
Why does she have to go
and get married, Lloyd?

890
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,630
Things were going so well.

891
00:50:54,713 --> 00:50:56,121
There it is.

892
00:50:57,466 --> 00:51:00,629
Hey. Sorry about the concussion.

893
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:02,902
It's okay.
And the whiplash.

894
00:51:03,002 --> 00:51:05,554
It's okay.
And the bruised stomach.

895
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,736
And the blood clot.

896
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:11,509
Nothing.

897
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:17,138
You know damn well that's your baby.

898
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:21,104
You know it's yours. Got the same chin.
The same lip.

899
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:23,958
That baby got the same head as you
and the same eye...

900
00:51:24,057 --> 00:51:26,327
Go take the test. Take the test.

901
00:51:26,425 --> 00:51:27,887
You want to hear the test results?

902
00:51:27,993 --> 00:51:29,400
In the case of the little baby...

903
00:51:29,497 --> 00:51:31,439
Well, the test says that is your baby.

904
00:51:31,545 --> 00:51:32,823
How you doing?

905
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:37,015
Latimore Construction, Norbit speaking.

906
00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:38,642
Hey, Norbit, it's Kate.

907
00:51:38,746 --> 00:51:41,047
Is there any way you can meet me
in town right now?

908
00:51:41,146 --> 00:51:42,258
Yeah, sure.

909
00:51:42,393 --> 00:51:43,637
Great. I'm at McCormick's.

910
00:51:43,737 --> 00:51:45,296
Okay. Fine.

911
00:51:50,905 --> 00:51:54,583
Rasputia, I'm just loaded up
with paperwork up to my ear.

912
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:57,715
I was wondering, could you run
these permits downtown for me?

913
00:51:57,818 --> 00:51:59,956
Now you tell me
what in the hell I look like,

914
00:52:00,057 --> 00:52:03,188
running some goddamn permits
down to City Hall for your ass.

915
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:04,346
You do it.

916
00:52:04,346 --> 00:52:04,629
You do it.

917
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:06,546
Okay.

918
00:52:07,897 --> 00:52:09,685
What's the surprise?
No, I'm not telling you.

919
00:52:09,785 --> 00:52:12,307
Tell me. Hey, no, what are you doing?

920
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:14,035
Not till the last second.
What? What?

921
00:52:14,138 --> 00:52:16,626
You ready?
Yeah, what is it?

922
00:52:17,946 --> 00:52:20,017
I know you don't think
I'm gonna get on that thing.

923
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,259
I think you're gonna get on that.
Hey, no way. Hey.

924
00:52:22,361 --> 00:52:24,946
Come on! Look where you wanna go.
You're doing great.

925
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:28,694
You got it? You got it? You got it?

926
00:52:28,793 --> 00:52:30,801
Watch out for the fence!

927
00:52:32,857 --> 00:52:34,134
And the mailbox.

928
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,639
Rasputia, the painters from
the Crestview site got food poisoning.

929
00:52:38,746 --> 00:52:40,568
There's vomit everywhere!

930
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:43,349
You know damn well
you clean up all the vomit. You do it!

931
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:46,352
I don't feel safe.
Yeah! You're doing great!

932
00:52:49,338 --> 00:52:50,516
Yeah.

933
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:56,050
The Portosans at Drummond's
tipped over!

934
00:52:56,154 --> 00:52:57,976
Well, go clean the shit up!

935
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:10,423
Rasputia?

936
00:53:24,378 --> 00:53:25,656
You do it!

937
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:28,659
I got it!
Go!

938
00:53:28,762 --> 00:53:31,763
I'm getting it! I'm doing it!

939
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:33,207
You're doing it! Yeah, but slow down!

940
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:36,175
How?
With the brakes! The brakes!

941
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:42,894
Oh, no. Are you okay?

942
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:45,969
Yeah. Actually, that was kind of fun.

943
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,842
Come on.
Okay, help me.

944
00:53:49,946 --> 00:53:51,986
Okay?
Yeah, yeah.

945
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:58,391
So, I'm going to Giovanni's tonight
to choose the food for the reception.

946
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:01,336
You wanna come? Help me decide?

947
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:03,158
What about Deion?

948
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,617
I just don't trust him with food.

949
00:54:06,714 --> 00:54:09,016
You know,
he made dinner for us the other night.

950
00:54:09,114 --> 00:54:11,220
It tasted like cheap takeout.

951
00:54:15,514 --> 00:54:16,758
Well, I'll go.
Good.

952
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:20,599
Well, I just have to go get my dress,
and then we can meet, say, at 7:00?

953
00:54:20,729 --> 00:54:21,908
Okay, that's great.

954
00:54:22,011 --> 00:54:24,693
Perfect, Norbit.
Okay, see you at 7:00.

955
00:54:26,298 --> 00:54:27,280
Norbit!

956
00:54:27,387 --> 00:54:28,815
All right. Yeah, Norby.

957
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:30,776
7:00, don't be late.

958
00:54:31,418 --> 00:54:33,590
You guys are all pervs.

959
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:37,015
I love it.

960
00:54:38,938 --> 00:54:40,181
What's wrong?

961
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:42,707
Are you sure we're not rushing things?

962
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:46,836
I know we're not. I know we're not.
I couldn't be happier.

963
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:50,482
Norbit, that's a date.

964
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:52,820
No, it's not. She just wants someone...

965
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,604
Are you paying for this encounter
this evening?

966
00:54:55,705 --> 00:54:56,652
Of course not!

967
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,339
Then that's a date.
Don't be trying to tell a pimp his game.

968
00:55:01,338 --> 00:55:02,864
Come on, baby.

969
00:55:05,497 --> 00:55:07,058
Thank you.
Carmen, honey!

970
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:08,567
All right.

971
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,913
Well, who are you getting all fine for?

972
00:55:13,017 --> 00:55:15,766
Hello, Rasputia. Well, that's nice.

973
00:55:15,865 --> 00:55:17,720
Oh, yeah, right.
Why you trying to look all extra today?

974
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:21,200
Oh, I'm just, you know, being a girl.

975
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:26,768
My fianc¨¦ likes it
when I take care of myself.

976
00:55:26,873 --> 00:55:28,815
Look to me like
that fish already in his net.

977
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:31,059
You look like
you fixing to catch you a new fish.

978
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,836
What? No. God. Don't be silly.

979
00:55:35,736 --> 00:55:37,875
You're married. You're here.

980
00:55:37,976 --> 00:55:39,470
I don't do this for my husband.

981
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:42,129
Girl, I do this
because I have a reputation to uphold.

982
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:46,094
Everybody in this town know that
Rasputia Latimore is fine. Ain't I fine?

983
00:55:46,201 --> 00:55:48,055
You fine, girl! You are fine.
Sister!

984
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:49,297
Everybody knows.

985
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,215
But even a delicate flower like me
need a little water from time to time.

986
00:55:52,313 --> 00:55:54,581
Or a little lye in her kitchen
to help straighten out them petals.

987
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,859
How you doing?

988
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,138
Rasputia.

989
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:59,128
Helga waiting on you, girl,
to do your bikini wax.

990
00:55:59,225 --> 00:56:00,402
Here I come, girl.

991
00:56:00,505 --> 00:56:03,637
I got to go, girl. Every now and then
I got to mow the lawn.

992
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:07,379
You just make sure
all that sprucing up is for your fianc¨¦.

993
00:56:09,752 --> 00:56:12,337
Helga, here I come, girl.
It's a full moon, too.

994
00:56:16,056 --> 00:56:17,780
Here we go, dear.

995
00:56:24,472 --> 00:56:26,927
I was looking for Norbit's police whistle.

996
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:28,335
Go fish.

997
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,008
What's up?

998
00:56:30,104 --> 00:56:31,960
Everything on schedule
with the wedding?

999
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,966
I got my own problems, but I'll handle it.

1000
00:56:34,073 --> 00:56:35,698
What's this situation
you're talking about?

1001
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,689
The liquor license on the orphanage.

1002
00:56:37,786 --> 00:56:40,535
It won't roll over
when the property changes hands,

1003
00:56:40,632 --> 00:56:42,868
not without one of
these transfer requests upfront.

1004
00:56:42,968 --> 00:56:45,204
Yeah, and getting a new license
could take years.

1005
00:56:45,304 --> 00:56:47,890
Yeah, we'd be out of business
before we get started.

1006
00:56:47,992 --> 00:56:49,584
You think you can get Kate to sign that?

1007
00:56:49,687 --> 00:56:52,240
Hell, no. She's planning on
closing the restaurant.

1008
00:56:52,345 --> 00:56:53,906
It'd raise too many suspicions.

1009
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:56,114
All right, smartass,
then what we gonna do now?

1010
00:56:56,216 --> 00:56:58,551
Yeah.
Yeah.

1011
00:57:01,912 --> 00:57:02,861
Norbit.

1012
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:07,349
Where you going, Norbit?
Sit your punk ass down.

1013
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:11,378
Guys, I told Rasputia
the toilet needed to be reinforced

1014
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:13,008
and she said
that I should take care of it,

1015
00:57:13,113 --> 00:57:14,259
so I'm gonna go take care of that.

1016
00:57:14,361 --> 00:57:15,376
Forget that.

1017
00:57:15,481 --> 00:57:17,075
I can't. No, guys,
it's an accident waiting to happen.

1018
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:19,064
I have to deal with it.
I said forget that.

1019
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:20,687
We need you to
get these papers signed tonight.

1020
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:21,741
Oh, no. I can't do it tonight, guys.

1021
00:57:21,848 --> 00:57:23,822
There's an accident waiting to happen.
I have to deal with this...

1022
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:26,448
Norbit, if you don't
get these papers signed tonight,

1023
00:57:26,552 --> 00:57:28,243
we can't start
the remodel on the orphanage.

1024
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:29,325
That's right, punk ass.

1025
00:57:29,432 --> 00:57:31,888
Bullshit. I'm going for mine tonight.
I got things to do!

1026
00:57:31,993 --> 00:57:33,968
Norbit, you better find that Kate Thomas

1027
00:57:34,073 --> 00:57:35,382
and get her to sign.

1028
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,593
Yeah.

1029
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,568
Kate Thomas?

1030
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:41,298
You want me to get these papers
to Kate Thomas?

1031
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,546
Yeah.

1032
00:57:42,936 --> 00:57:43,885
Okay, that's more important.

1033
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:46,097
I'll take care of this for you guys.
I'll get these to Kate Thomas.

1034
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,622
That's what I told you to do.
Get your punk ass up.

1035
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:49,940
Okay, I'm gonna go take these to Kate

1036
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:51,983
and take my punk ass to Kate Thomas
right now.

1037
00:57:52,089 --> 00:57:53,878
Excuse me, pardon me.
Let me get through here. Thank you.

1038
00:57:53,977 --> 00:57:56,367
Excuse me. Going through. Hi.
Bitch ass.

1039
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,959
Yes, I am a bitch ass. Excuse me.
Kate Thomas.

1040
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:03,414
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1041
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:05,974
Man, it's time for
a pimpalicious makeover. Let's do this.

1042
00:58:06,072 --> 00:58:08,461
All right. But nothing too flashy now.
I wanna be flashy, but not...

1043
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,478
Class. I don't want no...

1044
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:21,236
Now, that's pimping.

1045
00:58:23,673 --> 00:58:25,647
All right, hair's bigger.

1046
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,136
Okay. Well, I guess this is it, guys.
Thanks a lot for all your help.

1047
00:58:49,497 --> 00:58:50,991
Thanks for making me fly.

1048
00:58:51,097 --> 00:58:53,202
You fly like a flock of birds, baby.

1049
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,797
You look good.
Thanks, guys.

1050
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:59,441
Handle this business for us, brother.
I'm gonna handle it. Gonna handle it.

1051
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,331
Do the walk, Norbit.
I got you.

1052
00:59:01,433 --> 00:59:03,343
Yeah. Norbit!

1053
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:12,814
Wow, Norbit!

1054
00:59:14,744 --> 00:59:16,434
I just picked these
on the side of the road,

1055
00:59:16,536 --> 00:59:19,057
'cause this is just a casual gettogether.

1056
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,936
Sure. And you put the wires
up the stems, too. That's a nice touch.

1057
00:59:23,705 --> 00:59:25,494
Norbit!
Hey, Sam.

1058
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:30,070
You dressed to kill, huh?

1059
00:59:30,169 --> 00:59:33,016
Katerina, you look beautiful.
Come sit, please.

1060
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:38,062
I'm making my specialty just for you.

1061
00:59:38,169 --> 00:59:40,340
Hey. Did you make my favorite?

1062
00:59:40,441 --> 00:59:42,165
What do you think, huh?

1063
00:59:42,906 --> 00:59:45,905
I'm gonna take the flowers,
put them into water, okay?

1064
00:59:46,394 --> 00:59:47,855
He's a nice man.

1065
00:59:50,073 --> 00:59:51,119
Your favorite?

1066
00:59:51,224 --> 00:59:53,493
I guess you and Rasputia
come here a lot, huh?

1067
00:59:53,592 --> 00:59:56,177
Oh, no. We used to,
but she got banned for life

1068
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,255
because Sam had
an allyoucaneat buffet once

1069
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:02,190
and she took it as a personal challenge,
and it got pretty ugly.

1070
01:00:03,384 --> 01:00:04,726
I wanna make a toast.

1071
01:00:04,824 --> 01:00:06,068
Oh, sure.

1072
01:00:08,376 --> 01:00:10,613
To old friends.

1073
01:00:10,713 --> 01:00:12,599
To old friends.

1074
01:00:14,296 --> 01:00:17,679
We were buddy partners, all right,
Norbit. We were.

1075
01:00:19,672 --> 01:00:22,488
I tell you, you know,

1076
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,709
sometimes I think
I should've never married Rasputia.

1077
01:00:27,161 --> 01:00:28,883
What do you mean, Norbit?

1078
01:00:28,984 --> 01:00:32,115
I was just really young, you know,
and she latched on to me

1079
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:36,306
and kind of helped me fit in
and gave me a family, so...

1080
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:39,765
We had nobody, Norbit.

1081
01:00:39,865 --> 01:00:43,181
I mean, who can blame us
for wanting to feel safe, you know?

1082
01:00:44,313 --> 01:00:46,069
Yeah, safe.

1083
01:00:46,584 --> 01:00:48,275
Like you and Deion?

1084
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:50,768
Yeah.

1085
01:00:52,728 --> 01:00:57,399
I mean,
it's different with Deion, obviously.

1086
01:01:00,729 --> 01:01:02,355
So, what have you got here?

1087
01:01:02,457 --> 01:01:05,042
Those are just construction papers,

1088
01:01:05,144 --> 01:01:07,565
permits and stuff that you have to sign.

1089
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,109
Kate, can I ask you
a personal question?

1090
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:13,742
Sure, what?

1091
01:01:18,168 --> 01:01:19,859
Do you love Deion?

1092
01:01:21,656 --> 01:01:24,690
Of course. Yeah.

1093
01:01:27,096 --> 01:01:30,413
Otherwise,
why would I be marrying him, right?

1094
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:33,134
Right?

1095
01:01:35,994 --> 01:01:39,408
Got your pizza.
It is about time.

1096
01:01:39,993 --> 01:01:42,710
I'm about to disappear up in here
I'm so hungry.

1097
01:01:42,808 --> 01:01:44,564
Norbit out draining a swamp
or something.

1098
01:01:44,664 --> 01:01:49,715
Yeah, he's definitely draining a swamp.
He's draining a swamp like he would be.

1099
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:56,979
Why you looking at me like that?
Where's Norbit?

1100
01:01:57,528 --> 01:02:01,041
Draining a swamp.
And why are you looking at me like that?

1101
01:02:01,913 --> 01:02:05,556
He's out there in the woods,
draining a swamp. I told you before.

1102
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,520
I don't know nothing.

1103
01:02:10,457 --> 01:02:12,978
I don't know nothing, okay?

1104
01:02:18,585 --> 01:02:22,065
He's on a date with that fine skinny girl!

1105
01:02:32,345 --> 01:02:34,416
It's pain time here! I ain't having this!

1106
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:38,262
Oh, hell, no. And on top of that
he been messing with my seat again?

1107
01:02:38,361 --> 01:02:39,953
Damn it, Norbit!

1108
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:46,133
He got me destroying my shit.

1109
01:02:56,185 --> 01:02:57,429
This is it.

1110
01:02:57,529 --> 01:02:59,503
It's always so beautiful in here.

1111
01:03:00,025 --> 01:03:01,486
Peaceful.

1112
01:03:01,656 --> 01:03:03,925
Hello, Kate, Norbit.
Hey.

1113
01:03:04,023 --> 01:03:07,286
Didn't know anybody was here.
I was getting ready to close up shop.

1114
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:10,963
You know, Kate,
this all happened so fast,

1115
01:03:11,065 --> 01:03:14,196
I realized we never had
a chance to rehearse.

1116
01:03:14,296 --> 01:03:15,955
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1117
01:03:16,056 --> 01:03:17,104
So, come on up here.

1118
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,575
Let me at least show you
where you're gonna stand.

1119
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:21,200
Come on.
All right.

1120
01:03:24,344 --> 01:03:27,127
Rasputia. You know
you no allowed in here.

1121
01:03:27,225 --> 01:03:29,331
The hell with that. Where's Norbit?

1122
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:32,565
I don't see Norbit.
Anybody is a see Norbit?

1123
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:34,040
No.
He hasn't been here.

1124
01:03:34,137 --> 01:03:38,740
Then who was eating a turkey ass?

1125
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,192
Run! Run! Run!

1126
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,459
At which point
you'll give your vows to Deion.

1127
01:03:47,128 --> 01:03:49,267
You want to practice those?

1128
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:54,099
Well, I hadn't actually gotten to that
quite yet.

1129
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:56,336
You don't even know
what you're gonna say yet?

1130
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:00,271
Well, what would you say, Norbit?
I don't know.

1131
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,135
What would I say?

1132
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,361
Norbit!

1133
01:04:10,616 --> 01:04:14,357
Don't cha wish your girlfriend
was hot like me

1134
01:04:14,455 --> 01:04:18,383
Don't cha wish your girlfriend
was a freak like me

1135
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:19,415
Don't cha

1136
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:22,224
What would I say if I was saying vows?

1137
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,149
I guess...

1138
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:26,256
Kate,

1139
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:29,742
I think about you all day long.

1140
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:34,193
And when I'm not near you,

1141
01:04:34,296 --> 01:04:37,013
all I think about is being near you.

1142
01:04:37,112 --> 01:04:38,737
And when you are near me,

1143
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,393
I feel like I'm at peace
with the whole world.

1144
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,334
I know that...

1145
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:48,691
I know I'll never have to
ask God for anything

1146
01:04:48,793 --> 01:04:50,996
'cause, as long as I have you in my life,

1147
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:54,357
I got everything I ever wanted.

1148
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,305
And the only thing
I really wanna do is just

1149
01:05:00,407 --> 01:05:05,078
spend the rest of my life making you
as happy as you've made me.

1150
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,791
Because I love you, Kate.

1151
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:13,454
I love you.

1152
01:05:14,904 --> 01:05:16,758
I don't know. Something like that.

1153
01:05:17,238 --> 01:05:19,759
And after the vows you would then...

1154
01:05:21,688 --> 01:05:22,637
Okay.

1155
01:05:53,527 --> 01:05:54,455
Oh, my God.

1156
01:05:55,287 --> 01:05:57,075
I'm sorry, I have to go.

1157
01:05:57,879 --> 01:05:59,123
I'm sorry.

1158
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:09,493
Awkward.
Yeah.

1159
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:19,057
Give me that crowbar.
I got some killing to do.

1160
01:06:31,382 --> 01:06:32,560
Damn it!

1161
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:36,784
I'm a Christian. You got me
up in this church cursing, Norbit.

1162
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,106
Death do us part, huh? Okay, Norbit.

1163
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,247
Look like you done moved up
the goddamn schedule.

1164
01:06:43,352 --> 01:06:44,845
I'm cursing again.

1165
01:06:45,078 --> 01:06:46,061
Pray, bitch, pray.

1166
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:47,727
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1167
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:51,180
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1168
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:54,668
Kate, please. Kate, please, I'm sorry.

1169
01:06:54,775 --> 01:06:55,920
Kate, please, stop and talk to me.

1170
01:06:56,024 --> 01:06:57,813
Please, please, Kate.
Talk to me, please.

1171
01:06:57,911 --> 01:06:59,601
I can't, Norbit.

1172
01:07:00,024 --> 01:07:01,682
I'm just too confused right now.

1173
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:05,100
I'm sorry. It was all my fault.
I never should have kissed you.

1174
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:07,126
No.

1175
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:11,407
I wanted you to.

1176
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:16,015
That's why I'm so confused.

1177
01:07:18,424 --> 01:07:19,918
Good night.

1178
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,273
She wanted me to.

1179
01:07:40,471 --> 01:07:44,049
Where the papers at, Norbit?
Got them for you right here.

1180
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:52,502
I'd hate to be you right now.

1181
01:07:53,016 --> 01:07:53,944
Why?

1182
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:56,723
Go on in the house.

1183
01:07:57,336 --> 01:07:58,645
Go on in.

1184
01:08:01,686 --> 01:08:04,338
Go ahead, fool. What you waiting for?

1185
01:08:04,439 --> 01:08:06,000
Get on in.

1186
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,341
Hello?

1187
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:24,946
Chocolate drop, I'm home.

1188
01:08:26,872 --> 01:08:28,662
Lollipop?

1189
01:08:30,488 --> 01:08:31,601
Mail.

1190
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:39,732
Expecting a letter, Norbit?

1191
01:08:40,471 --> 01:08:44,334
You frightened me.
No, I was just looking through.

1192
01:08:44,919 --> 01:08:46,642
How was your date?

1193
01:08:47,224 --> 01:08:48,434
Date?

1194
01:08:49,112 --> 01:08:52,789
That was no date. That was just...

1195
01:08:52,888 --> 01:08:57,328
I just was over at
what'shername's wedding rehearsal.

1196
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,844
That's all. It wasn't a date, though.

1197
01:09:04,151 --> 01:09:05,494
Oh, really?

1198
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:25,138
Lloyd. Is that you, Lloyd?

1199
01:09:26,072 --> 01:09:28,144
Lloyd, what am I gonna do?

1200
01:09:28,696 --> 01:09:30,256
Kill the bitch.

1201
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,622
Excuse me? What'd you say?

1202
01:09:32,727 --> 01:09:37,200
You heard me. Rub her out.
Take her down. Ice the bitch.

1203
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:40,943
Hey. Lloyd, you're talking.

1204
01:09:41,048 --> 01:09:44,627
She took my legs, Norbit.
She took my legs.

1205
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:47,576
You know what it's like to be a dog
with no legs?

1206
01:09:47,673 --> 01:09:49,396
I can't raise one up to pee.

1207
01:09:49,496 --> 01:09:54,197
Hell, I can't even hump no more, Norbit.
Humping was my thing.

1208
01:09:54,295 --> 01:09:56,434
What is this, Norbit?

1209
01:09:59,606 --> 01:10:02,455
Some kind of weird, satanic potato art?

1210
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,330
What's this?

1211
01:10:05,432 --> 01:10:07,887
It looks like the acid
that we use down at the quarry.

1212
01:10:07,992 --> 01:10:09,072
Right!

1213
01:10:09,176 --> 01:10:11,761
But this is
Miss Pretty Little Thang's little face.

1214
01:10:11,864 --> 01:10:15,858
And, Norbit, if you ever see her again,
if you ever talk to her again,

1215
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,196
if you ever so much
as think about the bitch again,

1216
01:10:18,295 --> 01:10:20,752
this is what's gonna happen to her.

1217
01:10:26,617 --> 01:10:28,143
How you doing?

1218
01:10:29,049 --> 01:10:31,119
You get the picture, Norbit?

1219
01:10:32,918 --> 01:10:35,668
Deion, I just think that
we need to take a beat.

1220
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:37,906
It's not you, it's me.

1221
01:10:38,006 --> 01:10:40,625
Just if we slow down, I...

1222
01:10:40,727 --> 01:10:42,483
Oh, good, you're up.

1223
01:10:42,584 --> 01:10:45,266
Deion, we need to talk.
Yes, we do.

1224
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:48,302
I was just at Latimore Construction,
you know, with the renovation plans,

1225
01:10:48,407 --> 01:10:50,740
and I found this on Big Black's desk.

1226
01:10:51,286 --> 01:10:52,334
What is it?

1227
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:54,676
It's a request to renew
the Golden Wonton's liquor license

1228
01:10:54,775 --> 01:10:57,262
and put it in the Latimores' name.

1229
01:10:57,975 --> 01:10:58,990
What?

1230
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:01,462
Baby, you signed it yesterday.
Look at the date.

1231
01:11:01,559 --> 01:11:03,861
No. No, I didn't sign anything.

1232
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,275
Just some permits
that Norbit gave me, but...

1233
01:11:08,374 --> 01:11:10,546
Well, did you read them?

1234
01:11:11,383 --> 01:11:13,357
No.
No. Great.

1235
01:11:13,463 --> 01:11:14,870
I don't get it, though, Deion.

1236
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:16,909
Why would the Latimores
want me to renew the liquor license

1237
01:11:17,014 --> 01:11:18,192
at the orphanage?

1238
01:11:18,295 --> 01:11:19,953
Baby, people say
they've been trying to get their hands on

1239
01:11:20,055 --> 01:11:22,194
that orphanage for years.

1240
01:11:22,296 --> 01:11:25,077
Apparently they want to turn it
into a strip joint.

1241
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:26,577
Disgusting.

1242
01:11:26,935 --> 01:11:29,652
First you gonna clean the basement,
then you gonna clean the garage,

1243
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,638
then you gonna go upstairs
and clean the attic.

1244
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:33,775
We don't even have an attic.

1245
01:11:33,879 --> 01:11:37,262
Well, then you build a damn attic, then,
Norbit! And then clean it!

1246
01:11:37,367 --> 01:11:40,117
I'm going upstairs to take a bubble bath.

1247
01:11:44,184 --> 01:11:47,860
Bitch! You bitch!

1248
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:51,562
Finally.

1249
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:55,790
I needed this.
Let me submerge this ass.

1250
01:11:55,891 --> 01:11:57,679
How you doing?

1251
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,443
Good and hot.

1252
01:12:02,963 --> 01:12:05,329
Sounds like it's raining outside.

1253
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,619
Oh, no.

1254
01:12:17,395 --> 01:12:18,540
Kate!

1255
01:12:18,643 --> 01:12:19,570
Norbit.

1256
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:21,772
Over here. Over here.

1257
01:12:22,898 --> 01:12:24,392
I need to talk to you.

1258
01:12:24,498 --> 01:12:27,531
Do you know what was in those papers
you had me sign last night?

1259
01:12:27,633 --> 01:12:29,422
Yeah, the construction permits.

1260
01:12:29,522 --> 01:12:31,561
No, that's not all.

1261
01:12:35,058 --> 01:12:36,236
Norbit.

1262
01:12:36,531 --> 01:12:40,042
Hey, just... Just go away, Kate!
Get out of here!

1263
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:41,258
What?

1264
01:12:43,377 --> 01:12:45,865
You heard what I said!
Just get out of here! Scram!

1265
01:12:45,969 --> 01:12:49,514
The Latimores are trying to
take control of the orphanage, Norbit.

1266
01:12:49,617 --> 01:12:53,513
Well, why don't you go and find
somebody who gives a rat's ass,

1267
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,073
because I sure as hell don't!

1268
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:59,592
You don't care?
No, I don't care.

1269
01:13:01,105 --> 01:13:03,855
And I don't care about you, either!
Norbit.

1270
01:13:03,953 --> 01:13:07,530
The only woman I have ever,
ever loved and ever cared about

1271
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:11,016
was my darling wife, Rasputia!

1272
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:14,120
But last night...

1273
01:13:14,226 --> 01:13:18,568
Last night I was just trying to nail you,
you know, score?

1274
01:13:19,025 --> 01:13:21,098
But now I realize I don't have to do that!

1275
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:26,537
All I need is my beautiful,
precious wife Rasputia!

1276
01:13:27,442 --> 01:13:31,698
She's all the woman I need, so
you can just go on and get out of here,

1277
01:13:31,794 --> 01:13:34,182
you screwy dame! Who needs you?

1278
01:13:35,186 --> 01:13:37,008
Damn, Norbit.

1279
01:13:37,106 --> 01:13:40,170
Did that skinny little thing
figure out your plan?

1280
01:13:40,273 --> 01:13:43,689
Girl, you just don't get it, do you?
Norbit played you.

1281
01:13:43,793 --> 01:13:45,997
You got her to sign those papers,
didn't you?

1282
01:13:46,096 --> 01:13:47,723
Yes, darling.

1283
01:13:48,594 --> 01:13:50,187
He been setting you up
from that moment

1284
01:13:50,289 --> 01:13:52,296
from the very first day you got here.

1285
01:13:52,402 --> 01:13:53,711
How you doing?

1286
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:57,359
Don't you ever talk to me again!

1287
01:13:58,737 --> 01:13:59,752
Kate.

1288
01:13:59,858 --> 01:14:02,443
Damn, Norbit,
you pissing off everybody today.

1289
01:14:02,545 --> 01:14:07,565
Don't you ever talk to me again!
Don't you ever talk to me again!

1290
01:14:09,939 --> 01:14:11,117
Never again!

1291
01:14:42,161 --> 01:14:43,438
Hey, Norbit.

1292
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:47,085
Mr. Wong,
what are you doing around here?

1293
01:14:47,186 --> 01:14:50,764
I just going for a walk, Norbit.
Just going for a walk.

1294
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:54,345
I live in this neighborhood long time.
Long time.

1295
01:14:55,185 --> 01:14:57,193
Soon I be moving on.

1296
01:14:57,297 --> 01:14:59,718
Yes, as I look around this neighborhood,

1297
01:14:59,825 --> 01:15:03,209
I realize there
no good dry cleaners here.

1298
01:15:03,314 --> 01:15:04,939
I could make killing.

1299
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,351
Why you got suitcase?

1300
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:09,384
I'm getting the H out of here.
I'm leaving town for good.

1301
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:10,570
What? Leaving town?

1302
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:13,805
I thought you stick around,
help Kate run orphanage.

1303
01:15:14,322 --> 01:15:15,848
She's getting married
to Deion tomorrow,

1304
01:15:15,953 --> 01:15:18,343
so there's no reason
for me to stay around here.

1305
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:19,879
No reason?

1306
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:21,643
No, she won't even see me.

1307
01:15:21,746 --> 01:15:23,950
And besides,
I'll just wind up getting hurt again.

1308
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:27,247
Norbit, you listen to me.
You very special to me.

1309
01:15:28,018 --> 01:15:32,010
I love you like my own child,
like boy child, not girl child.

1310
01:15:32,113 --> 01:15:34,382
Wong once have girl child
back in Shanghai.

1311
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:36,903
When she two years old,
I trade her for yak.

1312
01:15:37,009 --> 01:15:39,464
That sort of thing happen in China
from time to time.

1313
01:15:39,569 --> 01:15:41,164
Yak very hard to come by.

1314
01:15:41,266 --> 01:15:43,883
Oh, yeah, sure. I appreciate that.

1315
01:15:43,985 --> 01:15:46,735
You can't run
from your problems, Norbit.

1316
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:50,608
Black people run fast,
but problem even faster.

1317
01:15:51,217 --> 01:15:52,744
That's kind of racist.

1318
01:15:52,849 --> 01:15:56,810
Yes. Wong very racist. I no like black.
I no like Jew either.

1319
01:15:56,912 --> 01:15:59,565
But black and Jew love Chinese food.
Go figure.

1320
01:16:00,434 --> 01:16:02,768
Always remember two things, Norbit.

1321
01:16:02,865 --> 01:16:07,142
One, even though you're very ugly,

1322
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,966
you're very strong inside, like warrior.

1323
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:14,188
And two, mail come late on Friday.

1324
01:16:15,952 --> 01:16:18,025
Wong Dry Cleaning.

1325
01:16:18,801 --> 01:16:20,492
It could have been huge.

1326
01:16:20,594 --> 01:16:24,106
You don't even have to clean nothing,
you just spray with starch.

1327
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:44,779
Mr...

1328
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:51,437
I gotta warn Kate.

1329
01:16:59,761 --> 01:17:00,743
Hello?

1330
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,856
Hello, Kate. Kate, it's Norbit.
I have to talk to you.

1331
01:17:02,961 --> 01:17:06,223
Please don't call me anymore.
No, Kate, it's very important.

1332
01:17:07,761 --> 01:17:09,037
Kate?

1333
01:17:21,618 --> 01:17:22,796
Going somewhere, Norbit?

1334
01:17:22,898 --> 01:17:25,133
No, I was... No.

1335
01:17:25,232 --> 01:17:26,825
What did I tell you
about leaving this house?

1336
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:29,296
I was just going to get some fresh air.

1337
01:17:29,393 --> 01:17:31,880
Boy, you ain't going nowhere
till after that wedding's done.

1338
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:33,546
We got too much riding on that.

1339
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,538
What do you have
riding on the wedding?

1340
01:17:35,633 --> 01:17:37,738
Soon as your little friend says, "I do,"

1341
01:17:37,841 --> 01:17:40,973
Deion and us is gonna
turn the orphanage into a titty bar.

1342
01:17:41,297 --> 01:17:43,435
But what about the little orphans?

1343
01:17:43,537 --> 01:17:46,472
Hell, they can come too,
if they pay the cover.

1344
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:51,342
John the Baptist, stop their evil plan.

1345
01:17:52,114 --> 01:17:54,056
Get your ass down in the basement.

1346
01:17:54,578 --> 01:17:56,040
Get down there!

1347
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:06,220
It's a madhouse! A madhouse!

1348
01:18:21,745 --> 01:18:24,266
Come on, Rasputia! We gonna be late.
Yeah.

1349
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:26,225
I know y'all better stop rushing me.

1350
01:18:26,321 --> 01:18:28,688
Beauty takes time.
This don't just happen.

1351
01:18:28,785 --> 01:18:29,996
Oh, no.

1352
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:31,218
You get out the car.

1353
01:18:31,314 --> 01:18:31,666
You gonna stay here
and make sure Norbit don't go no place.

1354
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,040
You gonna stay here
and make sure Norbit don't go no place.

1355
01:18:33,137 --> 01:18:35,559
What? Why I gotta stay?

1356
01:18:35,666 --> 01:18:38,032
Because everybody know
you the smartest.

1357
01:18:54,258 --> 01:18:57,705
Three minutes to show time.
Not too late to chicken out.

1358
01:18:58,353 --> 01:19:00,077
No, I'm ready.

1359
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:02,540
Okay. You look beautiful.

1360
01:19:20,305 --> 01:19:22,607
POWER.

1361
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:26,732
T to the A to the motherstanking P.
Powertap the fat, move back.

1362
01:19:26,834 --> 01:19:28,558
Powertap the fat, move back.

1363
01:19:47,218 --> 01:19:48,712
What are the Latimores doing here?

1364
01:19:48,819 --> 01:19:51,982
Don't worry. It's your day.
You look beautiful.

1365
01:20:01,073 --> 01:20:02,284
Nuts.

1366
01:20:02,832 --> 01:20:05,322
Tap, tap, tap. Tap it off.
Tap, tap. Tap...

1367
01:20:06,002 --> 01:20:07,180
Norbit!

1368
01:20:09,233 --> 01:20:11,405
Norbit? Norbit?

1369
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:15,120
Oh, damn. He escaped.

1370
01:20:15,921 --> 01:20:17,678
Norbit! Norbit!

1371
01:20:18,642 --> 01:20:20,616
Your ass is mine, Norbit!

1372
01:20:29,811 --> 01:20:31,054
Yeah.

1373
01:20:35,473 --> 01:20:37,415
Just now? Shit.
Is he all right?

1374
01:20:37,809 --> 01:20:39,948
Norbit escaped. He gonna be
headed this way. Come on.

1375
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:41,458
Hell, no.

1376
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:47,377
Norbit is coming.
For shizzle?

1377
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:49,547
We have to figure out way
to stall wedding.

1378
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:50,927
Just calm down, Mr. Wong.

1379
01:20:51,026 --> 01:20:54,124
I've ruined plenty of weddings
back in the day. I got this.

1380
01:20:54,705 --> 01:20:56,461
Dearly beloved,

1381
01:20:56,562 --> 01:21:00,490
we are gathered here today
to join these two in holy matrimony.

1382
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:03,179
Your Honor, I object!

1383
01:21:03,826 --> 01:21:07,174
Object? Sir, we've not gotten to
that part yet.

1384
01:21:07,282 --> 01:21:10,989
Then I'm objeculating prematurely,
Reverend.

1385
01:21:12,463 --> 01:21:15,693
No offense, my brother, but we're just
trying to keep the train rolling here.

1386
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:18,989
Oh, well, if you want to
get the train rolling, you know...

1387
01:21:19,088 --> 01:21:21,161
You got to use the big "L".

1388
01:21:22,447 --> 01:21:23,430
Lesbians.

1389
01:21:23,536 --> 01:21:25,609
No, man.
I ain't talking about no lesbians.

1390
01:21:25,713 --> 01:21:27,206
Although, late at night.
Yes.

1391
01:21:27,311 --> 01:21:28,773
Right?
Yes.

1392
01:21:28,976 --> 01:21:31,758
No, brother, we talking about love.
Love.

1393
01:21:31,856 --> 01:21:37,257
Love is the engine
that drives the train forward, backwards,

1394
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:41,932
side to side,
round and round love does go.

1395
01:21:42,033 --> 01:21:44,488
You understand me? I got this, brother.

1396
01:21:44,592 --> 01:21:48,847
I'm not talking about no $20 up in here,
back seat of the car,

1397
01:21:48,944 --> 01:21:50,831
stankystanky, hankypanky.

1398
01:21:50,927 --> 01:21:51,855
No.
No.

1399
01:21:51,951 --> 01:21:54,253
I'm talking about good, wholesome,

1400
01:21:54,352 --> 01:21:57,222
fortified with
eight essential vitamins love.

1401
01:21:57,328 --> 01:21:58,703
That cost anywhere...

1402
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,749
How much it cost?

1403
01:21:59,857 --> 01:22:03,751
About $136, Monday through Fridays.
$212 on the weekends.

1404
01:22:03,856 --> 01:22:06,573
Because of inflation.
Can I get an "Amen"?

1405
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:07,719
Amen!

1406
01:22:17,618 --> 01:22:19,439
Where the hell you going, Norbit?

1407
01:22:19,537 --> 01:22:22,440
None of your GD beeswax, Rasputia!

1408
01:22:22,545 --> 01:22:24,453
Look at you, you old stupid fool.
You can't even ride a bike.

1409
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:27,429
Oh, yes, I can, because Kate taught me!

1410
01:22:36,464 --> 01:22:40,522
Brothers and sisters.
This particular one's for the brothers.

1411
01:22:40,624 --> 01:22:44,170
When you buy the ones that say,
"Ribbed for her pleasure,"

1412
01:22:44,272 --> 01:22:48,680
turn them inside out
and they ribbed for your pleasure.

1413
01:22:48,784 --> 01:22:50,923
Can I get an "Amen"?
Amen!

1414
01:22:51,024 --> 01:22:53,413
Now, speaking of ribs and pleasure.

1415
01:22:53,937 --> 01:22:58,127
Yes. For a limited time only,
we are proud to present to you

1416
01:22:58,225 --> 01:23:01,291
our barbeque, baby back, horseradish,

1417
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:04,206
mustard and
peanut butterencrusted ribs

1418
01:23:04,303 --> 01:23:08,809
with a slight Jagermeister infusion
sprinkled with chamomile leaves

1419
01:23:08,911 --> 01:23:13,419
with a horseradish
and dandelion salad on a bed of rice.

1420
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:16,488
Buy one Pimp Platter,
get the whole bones free.

1421
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:19,495
No, no, no! That's enough talking.

1422
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:21,455
It's time to get back to the wedding.

1423
01:23:21,552 --> 01:23:25,992
It ain't never enough talking
when you talking about love, brother.

1424
01:23:26,096 --> 01:23:28,201
Ain't that right?
Yeah!

1425
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:29,798
Let me hear you say it, people!

1426
01:23:29,905 --> 01:23:30,888
Love!

1427
01:23:30,993 --> 01:23:32,935
Let me hear you sing it, choir!

1428
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,049
Love!

1429
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,581
I'm gonna rip your head off.
Rasputia.

1430
01:23:48,687 --> 01:23:50,030
What?
Car!

1431
01:23:50,129 --> 01:23:51,755
I don't give a damn about no car.
I'm ready to die.

1432
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:53,166
Car!

1433
01:23:55,056 --> 01:23:56,999
I'm ready to die!

1434
01:23:58,417 --> 01:23:59,398
I'm ready to die.

1435
01:23:59,504 --> 01:24:02,188
I ain't gonna let you ruin Nipplopolis
for me, boy! Damn!

1436
01:24:02,289 --> 01:24:04,198
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die up in here.

1437
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,151
Drive the car, God damn it!

1438
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:16,010
What's up, white man?
Pay for your sins. Pay for your sins.

1439
01:24:16,272 --> 01:24:18,476
We gonna change your name to Leroy.

1440
01:25:12,689 --> 01:25:14,478
Amen!

1441
01:25:18,672 --> 01:25:19,752
That's enough!

1442
01:25:19,857 --> 01:25:23,022
That's enough! Enough! Enough!
Enough! Enough!

1443
01:25:23,282 --> 01:25:24,972
Stop the music!
Hold on.

1444
01:25:25,105 --> 01:25:27,342
Shut up! You two, shut up!

1445
01:25:27,442 --> 01:25:29,198
That's it. This is husbandandwife time.

1446
01:25:29,298 --> 01:25:32,777
Now, let's go. Let's go.
Husbandandwife stuff.

1447
01:25:34,801 --> 01:25:35,727
Dearly beloved,

1448
01:25:36,688 --> 01:25:37,866
we are gathered here today...

1449
01:25:37,968 --> 01:25:39,212
I object!

1450
01:25:39,313 --> 01:25:40,622
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1451
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:42,469
Norbit.
Norbit.

1452
01:25:42,577 --> 01:25:43,525
Norbit.

1453
01:25:43,633 --> 01:25:46,317
Norbit

1454
01:25:47,056 --> 01:25:49,642
This wedding is a sham
and I'm here to stop it.

1455
01:25:49,745 --> 01:25:51,632
Norbit, what are you doing?

1456
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:55,242
I'm being a man
for the first time in my life. Kate...

1457
01:25:56,049 --> 01:25:57,903
Kate, I love you.

1458
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:01,646
What the hell did you just say?

1459
01:26:02,994 --> 01:26:05,612
You heard what I said, strumpet.
I love Kate!

1460
01:26:05,713 --> 01:26:07,918
That's right. I love you, Kate.

1461
01:26:08,018 --> 01:26:11,212
And the last two weeks I spent with you
have meant more to me

1462
01:26:11,311 --> 01:26:14,028
than my whole entire miserable life
with you, Rasputia!

1463
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:19,049
It's over! Norbit Albert Rice
is no longer your bitch!

1464
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,230
You're dead! Get off me!

1465
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:26,855
Get your hands off me, Black.
Don't go hitting me.

1466
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,099
What's wrong with you, girl?
What's wrong with you? Get off of me.

1467
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,312
You don't talk like that with me.

1468
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:31,344
No, wait!

1469
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:32,650
No, no, wait, baby girl,
he's ruining our wedding.

1470
01:26:32,752 --> 01:26:33,996
Let's just get back to the nuptials.

1471
01:26:34,095 --> 01:26:36,681
We just heard condom advice
from an expimp.

1472
01:26:36,784 --> 01:26:39,272
I think we can survive
a few words from Norbit.

1473
01:26:39,377 --> 01:26:42,247
Deion is a fake. He's marrying you
just to get your money.

1474
01:26:42,353 --> 01:26:43,301
What?

1475
01:26:43,408 --> 01:26:46,376
Him and the Latimores.
They thought this whole scheme up.

1476
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,512
He's been married four times in the
last six years to four different women,

1477
01:26:49,615 --> 01:26:52,517
and he cheated the women
out of $300,000 in divorce settlements.

1478
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:54,314
Yeah, I heard all about it!
And something else.

1479
01:26:54,415 --> 01:26:56,520
They were gonna try to steal
the orphanage from you.

1480
01:26:56,623 --> 01:26:57,802
That's what this whole thing is about!

1481
01:26:57,904 --> 01:27:00,937
You crazy! He's got a big crush on you.
He's making this stuff up.

1482
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,763
Oh, yeah? I'm crazy?
I'm making it all up?

1483
01:27:02,864 --> 01:27:05,003
Yes, you making it up.
Then what about this, then?

1484
01:27:05,105 --> 01:27:07,690
This evidence that I have.
Look at this!

1485
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,895
This, well...

1486
01:27:11,088 --> 01:27:14,536
This used to, before it fell in the pond,
it had numbers

1487
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,048
and there was information.

1488
01:27:16,145 --> 01:27:19,112
There was people's names
and dates and addresses

1489
01:27:19,216 --> 01:27:21,705
and all kinds of incriminating things.

1490
01:27:21,809 --> 01:27:25,932
I fell in the pond, but you can't read it.
But, boy, did I have your ass!

1491
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:29,388
That's nice, Norbit. Really nice.
Did you write that yourself? Pathetic.

1492
01:27:29,487 --> 01:27:30,982
Kate, you have to believe me.

1493
01:27:31,087 --> 01:27:32,265
Yeah, yeah, believe him, Kate.

1494
01:27:32,368 --> 01:27:34,702
Remember the one that got you to sign
the papers to steal the orphanage?

1495
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,939
Remember that?
Believe him. Go ahead.

1496
01:27:37,425 --> 01:27:41,679
I'm so sorry, Norbit.
I just don't trust you anymore.

1497
01:27:46,543 --> 01:27:49,446
Well, well, well, Norbit. You lose again.

1498
01:27:49,552 --> 01:27:53,262
Once a loser, always a loser, huh?
Now, come on! Let's go!

1499
01:27:54,705 --> 01:27:58,250
Yeah, I thought you'd feel
that way about it, Kate.

1500
01:27:59,697 --> 01:28:01,607
And that's why I took the liberty

1501
01:28:01,713 --> 01:28:05,159
of inviting some of
Deion's exwives down

1502
01:28:05,264 --> 01:28:07,532
so maybe they could tell you
for themselves.

1503
01:28:07,631 --> 01:28:09,192
Ladies!

1504
01:28:09,295 --> 01:28:10,757
Hello, Antoine.

1505
01:28:10,896 --> 01:28:13,711
I've been looking for you.
Daddy!

1506
01:28:13,808 --> 01:28:16,198
Antoine? He told me
his name was Luther!

1507
01:28:16,304 --> 01:28:17,232
Who is that ho?

1508
01:28:17,328 --> 01:28:18,888
He told me he was gay.

1509
01:28:18,992 --> 01:28:22,822
No, no, no. Y'all got me confused with
my gay twin brother, Antoine Luther.

1510
01:28:22,928 --> 01:28:25,316
You dead, gold digger!
Get your butt back here!

1511
01:28:25,424 --> 01:28:26,439
I'm out!

1512
01:28:26,544 --> 01:28:28,519
Looks like the wedding's off, bro.

1513
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:29,934
Church!

1514
01:28:31,537 --> 01:28:33,163
God damn it, Norbit!
Oh, snap!

1515
01:28:33,265 --> 01:28:34,193
Get him!

1516
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:35,435
Norbit!

1517
01:28:37,361 --> 01:28:40,111
Mother Mary! Jesus! Noah! Christ!

1518
01:28:41,201 --> 01:28:42,182
Good.

1519
01:28:56,784 --> 01:28:58,507
You going somewhere, Norbit?

1520
01:29:09,681 --> 01:29:11,688
You messed up, boy.
That's right.

1521
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:15,015
Now you gonna pay. Big time!

1522
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:18,349
Latimore! Keep your fakakta hands
off him!

1523
01:29:18,448 --> 01:29:20,837
Go back to your shop, Abe,
before I kill you, too!

1524
01:29:20,943 --> 01:29:24,010
Hey! You gonna have to kill me, as well!

1525
01:29:24,112 --> 01:29:25,835
Yeah, and me, too!

1526
01:29:32,528 --> 01:29:33,935
Rasputia!

1527
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:37,386
How you doing?

1528
01:29:38,672 --> 01:29:41,061
I kick the shit out of you.

1529
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:46,440
Mind your goddamn business.

1530
01:29:46,544 --> 01:29:48,933
Mind your business. Get out of here.
Move it.

1531
01:29:49,904 --> 01:29:51,595
No, you didn't!

1532
01:29:51,697 --> 01:29:53,584
Byebye.

1533
01:29:58,063 --> 01:30:00,103
Bring it, bitches!

1534
01:30:03,567 --> 01:30:04,909
Oh, hell to the no.

1535
01:30:05,008 --> 01:30:07,397
Mrs. Henderson is tripping, huh?
Get your...

1536
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:11,566
You crazy little old bitch.
How you doing?

1537
01:30:20,688 --> 01:30:22,062
Get out of the way.

1538
01:30:22,895 --> 01:30:24,173
His ass is mine.

1539
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:27,627
'Sputia? Rasputia?

1540
01:30:28,592 --> 01:30:30,632
You remember "till death do us part,"
don't you, Norbit?

1541
01:30:30,736 --> 01:30:31,816
No!

1542
01:30:33,456 --> 01:30:35,397
Whale, ho!

1543
01:30:36,687 --> 01:30:38,476
Did somebody just call me a whale?

1544
01:30:38,576 --> 01:30:40,615
Yeah, and a ho!

1545
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:48,137
Bingo! Right in the blow hole!

1546
01:30:51,568 --> 01:30:53,608
Let's get some.
We dead.

1547
01:30:54,255 --> 01:30:56,492
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1548
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,091
Norbit!

1549
01:31:10,224 --> 01:31:11,303
Are you all right?

1550
01:31:11,408 --> 01:31:15,237
All right? This is the best I've ever felt
in my whole life.

1551
01:31:16,911 --> 01:31:18,188
Come here.

1552
01:31:24,431 --> 01:31:25,478
Proud of that boy.

1553
01:31:25,582 --> 01:31:30,023
Yes. Yes, very proud of Norbit.
He like my son.

1554
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,490
I'm sorry I doubted you.

1555
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:42,534
In the end, I guess you could say
everything worked out just fine.

1556
01:31:44,976 --> 01:31:48,771
Kate and I took over the orphanage
and it was a dream come true.

1557
01:31:49,646 --> 01:31:53,224
Oh, and we also got married. Again.

1558
01:31:53,326 --> 01:31:54,853
I love you, Kate.

1559
01:31:55,214 --> 01:31:56,392
Ditto.

1560
01:31:57,518 --> 01:32:00,780
And I now pronounce you my wife.

1561
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,611
And I pronounce you my husband.

1562
01:32:06,415 --> 01:32:08,422
You may kiss the bride.

1563
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:16,902
What you mean, "Ew"? No, "Ew."
Man kiss a woman, beautiful thing.

1564
01:32:17,008 --> 01:32:19,594
Ling Ling.
Come here with your fine self.

1565
01:32:24,176 --> 01:32:27,142
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1566
01:32:40,463 --> 01:32:42,667
As for Rasputia
and the rest of the Latimores,

1567
01:32:42,768 --> 01:32:44,872
we never heard from them again.

1568
01:32:44,975 --> 01:32:48,805
Rumor has it they settled somewhere
in Mexico and opened the club.

1569
01:32:52,783 --> 01:32:55,150
I guess they're living their dream, too.

1570
01:32:55,344 --> 01:32:58,027
Say, man, don't you have
any betterlooking girls than that?

1571
01:32:58,128 --> 01:33:00,267
Our best girl's coming out right now.

1572
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,846
Rasputia!

1573
01:33:14,448 --> 01:33:15,528
Hold on, now, Pepe.

1574
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:18,533
Ain't nothing going down there unless
it got the word "peso" written on it.

1575
01:33:40,556 --> 01:33:56,885
THE END
