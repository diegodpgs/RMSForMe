1
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,980
A dollar for a homeless vet.
Come on, little man.

2
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,339
Come on, little man.
I fought the war
with your daddy.

3
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:29,154
Y'all ain't paid me
for this leg yet.
Thank you, sugar.

4
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,068
Jackie Chan!
Jackie Chan!

5
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:34,186
Shanghai Noon.

6
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:38,956
I take traveler's checks.
Arigato to you too.
Thank you, sugar.

7
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:47,472
Here you go.
Thanks.

8
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:14,873
You kids!

9
00:03:25,617 --> 00:03:27,457
Here.
Hold it right there!

10
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,100
- What happened?
- Step away from her.

11
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,133
Oh, man,
he ain't done nothing.

12
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:34,173
Those kids.
Who took your bag?
This man?

13
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,298
No, it was a couple of punks.
They came and they just ran off.

14
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:39,347
Four-eight, this is Romano.
Robbery and assault victim...

15
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:41,429
with facial wound
at East 42nd entrance.

16
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:43,594
Sir, I'd like you
to just stand right there.

17
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:46,805
Certainly.
Are you traveling somewhere?

18
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:50,216
I have arrived.
My travels are over
for the time being.

19
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,918
Where's your luggage?

20
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,749
I don't require luggage.
Do you have a ticket?

21
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,827
Train ticket?
Ticket stub?

22
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,428
I didn't arrive by train.

23
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,337
Would you remove your sunglasses
for me, please?

24
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:09,058
Oh, I'd rather not.
I'd forgotten,
but I mean, wow,

25
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,334
Your planet
is really bright.

26
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,783
I see.
East 42, we have an E.D.P.

27
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,966
I have to ask you
to come with us, sir.

28
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,973
Of course.

29
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,575
Freddy!

30
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:46,474
Did you see this fella
come out of a gate?

31
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:49,784
He didn't come from no gate.
Brother came from nowhere.

32
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:51,963
You know what I'm saying?

33
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,050
Yeah, Freddy,
I know what you're saying.

34
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:46,591
I don't wanna go outside,
because there's things
that can kill you--

35
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:53,522
Thank you.

36
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,644
If you breathe
all those chemicals out there,

37
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:58,492
not to mention the cosmic rays
and the West Nile virus,

38
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:02,287
and that other one--
the new airborne pigeon disease
nobody wants to talk about.

39
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:04,367
The new pigeon disease.
I've heard of that.

40
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:07,288
Another thing that's been
bothering me is the food.

41
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:10,367
The cafeteria serves
lukewarm food,
full of germs.

42
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:12,657
You really need to do something
about that, Dr. Powel l.

43
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:14,667
Heat is the only thing
that kills germs. Heat.

44
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,390
Point taken.
We'll look into that
right away.

45
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:22,867
In the meantime,
I want you to start taking
Your medication again.

46
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:25,692
It'll help you sleep.
And you need the sleep, Ernie.

47
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,768
Sleep is good.

48
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:33,615
Is our time up?

49
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:36,092
Only for today, Ernie.

50
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:40,925
Two calls:
Your wife, bring home
a bottle of wine.

51
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:42,951
Yeah.
And Dr. Chakraborty.

52
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:45,513
A transfer from Bellevue
he wants you to take a look at.

53
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:49,981
Great. Who is it this time?
Jesus Christ or Joan of Arc?

54
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:52,886
Dr. Chakraborty didn't say.

55
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:21,526
He arrived at Bellevue
a month ago,

56
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:24,055
suspicion of
hallucinogenic intoxication.

57
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,360
But, uh, he was found
negative for substances
of any kind.

58
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:29,776
His EKG, his blood value
are all normal.

59
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:32,155
There's no sign of concussion,
no brain tumor,

60
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,935
no temporal lobe, epilepsy,
no indication of organic
abnormality whatsoever.

61
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,534
However, after one month,

62
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:41,435
his amnesia and his delusion
have persisted.

63
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,960
He claims to be not human.

64
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:47,502
A visitor
from another planet.

65
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:50,363
They administered Thorazine
on this guy for three weeks...

66
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:54,121
at 300 milligrams a day,
and he was unresponsive?

67
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,639
How can you be unresponsive
to 300 milligrams of Thorazine?
It's impossible.

68
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,781
That's why
they sent him to you.

69
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:02,347
Terrific.

70
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:05,774
No I.D.,
no missing persons report
matching his description.

71
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:08,276
What's this?

72
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:11,176
He had it on him.

73
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:16,906
Well, let's hope
extraterrestrials
qualify for Medicaid.

74
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:20,304
He's here, Doctor.

75
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:22,991
Thank you, Joyce.

76
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:27,743
Medical record 2-8-7.
Calls himself Prot.

77
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:33,846
This one's as gentle
as a pussycat, Doc.

78
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,467
Come in.
Have a seat.

79
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:40,615
"Have a seat."
Curious expression.

80
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:45,022
Well, let me introduce
myself. I'm--

81
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:47,646
Dr. Mark Powell,
Chief of Clinical Psychiatry...

82
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:50,234
of the Manhattan
Psychiatric Institute.

83
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:53,141
Good. You know
where you are.

84
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:58,556
Well, now, uh...
Prot, is it?

85
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:01,962
"Prote."
I see, "Prote."

86
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:05,021
Well, Prot,
we're here to--
May I?

87
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:08,521
Please.

88
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:14,155
Red delicious.
You call this variety.

89
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,726
It's my favorite.

90
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,068
I'd like to begin
by asking you...

91
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:23,728
if you know
why you're here.

92
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,078
Of course.
You think I'm crazy.

93
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,780
We prefer the term "ill.''
Do you think you are ill?

94
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,252
A little homesick, perhaps.

95
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:38,951
Really.
Where is home?

96
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,220
K-PAX.

97
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:43,274
K-PAX?

98
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:45,636
Capital "K,'' hyphen,
capitals "P-A-X.''

99
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,135
K-PAX is a planet.

100
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,677
But don't worry,
I'm not going to
leap out of your chest.

101
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:54,706
I'm not worried.

102
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,229
It’s just that I'm only
familiar with nine planets.

103
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,690
Well, actually, there are ten,
but that doesn't matter.

104
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,910
I'm not from
Your solar system.

105
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:05,242
K-PAX is about 1 ,000
of your light-years
away from here...

106
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:08,104
in what you would call
Your constellation Lyra.

107
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:10,457
That's quite a ways.

108
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,594
I'm curious.
How did you get to Earth?

109
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:18,877
It's a matter of harnessing
the energy of light.

110
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,539
I know that sounds
crazy to you.

111
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:24,688
You beings are eons away
from discovering light travel.

112
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,697
You travel
at the speed of light?

113
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:33,823
Oh, no. We can travel
many times that speed.
Various multiples of "C.''

114
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:38,118
Otherwise, the trip here
would have taken about
1 ,000 years now, wouldn't it?

115
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:43,851
What if, um,
I were to tell you...

116
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:46,807
that according to a man
who lived on our planet
named Einstein,

117
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:51,727
that nothing can travel
faster than the speed
of light?

118
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:55,134
I would say that you misread
Einstein, Dr. Powell.
May I call you Mark?

119
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,309
You see, Mark,
what Einstein actually said...

120
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,719
was that nothing can accelerate
to the speed of light,

121
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,819
because its mass
would become infinite.

122
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:06,864
Einstein said nothing about
entities already traveling
at the speed of light or faster,

123
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:10,193
- at tachyon speeds.
- Tachyon?

124
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:13,929
I detect a note
of skepticism, Dr. Powell.

125
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:16,524
Oh, not at all.
It's just that you--

126
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,828
You speak English
so well.

127
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,879
I'm amazed.
Well, English isn't that
difficult a language to learn.

128
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:27,727
You should try speaking--

129
00:12:31,138 --> 00:12:33,978
I'm--
I'm confused.

130
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:36,624
Maybe you can explain
it to me. Uh...

131
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:39,773
how is it that
being a visitor from space,

132
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:42,421
that you-you look
so much like me...

133
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:45,012
or anyone else from Earth?

134
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,876
Why is a soap bubble round?

135
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,240
Why is a soap bubble round?

136
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:57,857
You know, for an educated
person, Mark, you repeat
things quite a bit.

137
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,405
Are you aware of that?

138
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,748
A soap bubble is round...

139
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:08,526
because it is the most
energy-efficient configuration.

140
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:13,327
Similarly, on your planet,
I look like you.

141
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:15,921
On K-PAX,
I look like a K-PAXian.

142
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:18,546
Prot,

143
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,133
why did you want to
come to our planet?

144
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:25,251
Well, I've been here
many times before.

145
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,850
But what brought me
here first? I don't know.

146
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,516
Pure curiosity, I guess.

147
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:34,745
I'd never been to
a Class BA-3 planet before.

148
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,960
Class BA-3?

149
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,970
Early stage of evolution.

150
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:42,252
Future uncertain.

151
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:45,388
And if I give all my possessions
to feed the poor--

152
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:49,396
Howie. Go on.
Talk to him.

153
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:52,443
Go on.

154
00:13:52,646 --> 00:13:55,726
You're really from...
up there?

155
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:58,991
Indeed.

156
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,929
I am from K-PAX.

157
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:05,595
What--

158
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,268
What sort of place is it?

159
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:11,094
K-PAX is bigger
than your planet.

160
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,130
But we are circled
by seven purple moons.

161
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,942
Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit,

162
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:21,811
bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit.

163
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:23,532
Go on.

164
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,380
Well, K-PAX is most lovely
when K-MON and K-RIL
are in conjunction.

165
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,050
Those are our two suns.
What you would call
Agape and Satori.

166
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:09,946
You finish
Your homework, Abby?
Yeah.

167
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,109
I lost another tooth.

168
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:15,957
Oh, yeah? Let me see.
Hey! Maybe the tooth fairy
will come tonight, huh?

169
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:18,277
There's no such thing
as the tooth fairy, Dad.

170
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,771
There’s just you and Mom.

171
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:24,833
I fed them already.
I couldn't wait.
How was your day?

172
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:29,322
Oh, 6:15 was late.
Didn't leave the station
til 6.:30.

173
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:31,424
Should have caught
the nearest beam of light.

174
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:33,429
You should have caught what?

175
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:36,031
Oh, nothing.
How was your day?
Good.

176
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,940
Sent the deposit in
for the house on the cape for
the last two weeks of August.

177
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,941
Which works out perfectly,
'cause Abby doesn't get out
of camp till the 1 5th.

178
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:44,985
Sent the deposit in?

179
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:47,107
Yeah.
Come on, Rache.

180
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:50,554
That wasn't definite.
We were just talking.
I said maybe.

181
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,975
Maybe sometime in August
we'll clear it.

182
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:56,675
Maybe. Maybe we should start
paying you for your time.
You got a family rate?

183
00:15:56,908 --> 00:16:00,188
Oh, look.
They published my letter.

184
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:05,437
I spoke with Natalie about going
into the after-school program
next year,

185
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:08,109
in case
I go back to teaching.

186
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,059
And this morning my head
fell off, but I was able to sew
it back on with dental floss.

187
00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:15,943
Waxed, of course.
Dental floss?

188
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:18,022
Sorry.
I wasn't l listening.

189
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:20,144
Yeah, I know.
Let's just eat.

190
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:24,666
Train was late.
I'm tired.

191
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:27,257
And to top it off,
the city is dumping
patients on us.

192
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:29,762
I know.

193
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:38,048
You stink.

194
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:42,566
Have a nice day, Sal.

195
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,711
I've been to 64pLanets
within our galaxy.

196
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,962
Earth is the only one
with your species, Homo sapiens,
that I've visited so far.

197
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,059
And when did you arrive
on Earth?

198
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,261
Four years and nine months ago.

199
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,271
So that makes you how old?

200
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,273
In Earth terms, 337 years old.

201
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:03,597
I aged about seven getting here,
traveling at six multiples
of "C."

202
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,656
But really, Marko,
it only seemed like an instant.

203
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,380
Marko? Time may warp
at super light speed.

204
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,735
I'd say
access one psychosis NOS.

205
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:18,632
That's glib to
call him a psychotic.
That's a wastebasket diagnosis.

206
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:22,077
Oh, yeah?
He believes he traveled
here from another planet.

207
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:24,334
What's your diagnosis,
jet lag?

208
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:26,866
Well, how come he didn't
respond to the Haldol?

209
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:28,892
Haldol can make you
more psychotic.

210
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:31,254
It's rare,
but it does happen.

211
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,710
Look. I'm not saying
that medication can't be
a useful tool...

212
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:38,257
to help somebody like this,
but you can't--

213
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:42,159
He maybe a good subject
for the "Betazine" protocol.
The drug's on clinical trial.

214
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:44,998
You want to experiment on him
before we have a diagnosis?

215
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,354
Do you have some other idea?

216
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:51,331
He's not a danger to anyone.
How about getting
to know him first?

217
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:55,135
In the meantime,
we have ten new transfers
to take care of.

218
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:58,333
You know, maybe what's
wrong with him...

219
00:17:58,543 --> 00:18:01,543
is that he is.
Is what?

220
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:03,876
From the planet K-PAX.

221
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:43,096
Mmm.

222
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:50,119
Your produce alone
has been worth the trip.

223
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:58,593
Could you tell me...

224
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:01,898
a bit about your boyhood
on K-PAX?

225
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:03,951
Where were you born?

226
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:08,997
You were, uh,
born, right?

227
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,087
K-PAXians have babies?

228
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:13,688
Oh, yes, much like on Earth,
but unlike you humans,

229
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:17,398
the reproductive process
is quite unpleasant for us.

230
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,913
Could you compare
the effect to something
that I might understand?

231
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,970
Like a toothache?
It's more like having
your nuts in a vlse,

232
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:25,017
except we feel it all over.

233
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:27,501
And to make matters worse,
the sensation is associated...

234
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:31,084
with something like your nausea,
accompanied by a very bad smell.

235
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:34,431
The moment of climax is like
being kicked in the stomach,

236
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:37,528
and then falling into a pool
of mod droppings.

237
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,539
Mod droppings?

238
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:44,258
A mod is a being,
much like your skunk,
only far more potent.

239
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:50,392
Uh, if it's such
a terrible experience,

240
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,665
uh, how do you reproduce?

241
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,483
As carefully as possible.

242
00:19:57,717 --> 00:19:59,557
What are you doing?

243
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:03,398
Well, you just reminded me
of something I want to
include in my report.

244
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,679
Your report.
Yes, it's our custom...

245
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:08,529
to compile descriptions
of the various places
and people we encounter...

246
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,609
throughout the galaxy.

247
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,160
Morning, Betty.
Good morning, Prot.

248
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,445
Morning, Navarro.
Hey, what's up, man?

249
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:23,097
Mr. Friedman.
Morning, Maria.

250
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:27,447
- I'm Vanessa.
- Just chill.

251
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:30,898
Morning, Bess.

252
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,800
Morning, Bess.

253
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:36,922
She doesn't talk to anybody.
Afraid smoke will come out of
her mouth when she talks.

254
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:39,938
Been here since
she was a little girl.
Burned her house down.

255
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,060
Shouldn't play with matches.
Very dangerous.

256
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:47,508
It was an electrical flare.
Why do you make up stories
like that?

257
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:50,092
Ernie has a very powerful
imagination.

258
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,635
Phil listen!

259
00:20:55,864 --> 00:21:00,544
Come on, Doris.
You gotta come out of
Your room sometime.

260
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:02,789
Look what I brought
just for you.

261
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,976
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh,
pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh.

262
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,410
Do that again,
you go up to three.

263
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:15,022
Her Royal Highness never,
ever comes out of her room.
Not even to eat.

264
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:17,339
No wonder she's here.
I'm sick and tired
of this shit.

265
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:20,395
Everyday, coming up here
and shooting food at me.
I hate this.

266
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:31,957
The service here
is atrocious!

267
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:37,236
Good morning, Mrs. Archer.
Doris.

268
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,070
I wasn't expecting
any gentleman callers...

269
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,451
until this afternoon.

270
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:47,467
Excuse me.

271
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,231
You have a place
set for two.

272
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:10,537
Oh, yes. Um...
I'm expecting someone.

273
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:12,743
How long
have you been waiting?

274
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,830
Eleven years.

275
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:21,944
For some around here
might...

276
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,168
call that crazy,
but I prefer to call it...

277
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:27,701
romantic.

278
00:22:27,924 --> 00:22:30,804
Romantic.
Like a, uh...

279
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:34,821
waltz in the moonlight,
or a...

280
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:37,657
candlelit dinner...

281
00:22:37,894 --> 00:22:40,174
or a sunset.
Oh, we have those.

282
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:43,036
On K-PAX, we have two suns.

283
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:47,114
They rlse together
only once every 200 years.

284
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:49,282
And that is quite a sight.

285
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:55,381
He most definitely
has a sensitivity
to white light,

286
00:22:55,578 --> 00:22:59,418
but I think
it's his range that
You'll find interesting.

287
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:01,428
What am I looking at?

288
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:05,507
He can detect light
at a wavelength of up to
300 to 400 angstroms.

289
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:09,044
Ultraviolet.

290
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:12,024
Of course,
Prot's explanation is that...

291
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:16,423
due to his planet's
peculiar quality of light
caused by its two suns,

292
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:21,926
K-PAXians are used to
light conditions much like
our twilight most of the time.

293
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,155
W-Wait a minute.
Chuck, I didn't think...

294
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,242
human beings could see
ultraviolet light.

295
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,165
We can't.

296
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:47,686
Good morning, Joyce.

297
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:51,049
That's a lovely configuration
You're wearing today.
Thank you.

298
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:54,651
Macy's.
Come in.

299
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:08,866
This is so much better.

300
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:12,461
It's a lot like home.

301
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:28,413
Well, uh, Prot,

302
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,360
I was hoping you'd tell me
more about home.

303
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,738
Well, what would you
like to know?

304
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,949
Well, uh, do you, um,

305
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,520
do you have a family
on K-PAX?

306
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:47,462
It doesn't work on K-PAX
the same way it works
here, Mark.

307
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:50,782
On K-PAX, we don't
have families in the way
that you think of them.

308
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:55,279
In fact, a family would be
a non sequitur on our planet,
as it would on most others.

309
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:58,834
In other words, um,

310
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:03,569
You, uh, you never knew
Your parents.

311
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:07,967
On K-PAX, children are not
raised by their biological
parents, Mark, but by everyone.

312
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:11,347
They circulate among us,
learning from one
and then another.

313
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:14,366
Do you have a child?
No.

314
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:19,035
Do you have a wife waiting
back for you on K-PAX?

315
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,079
Mark. Mark. Mark.

316
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:27,136
You are not really listening
to what I'm saying to you,
are you?

317
00:25:29,502 --> 00:25:31,302
We do not have marriage
on K-PAX.

318
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:33,744
There are no wives.
There are no husbands.

319
00:25:33,963 --> 00:25:36,523
There are no families.

320
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,700
I see. So, um,

321
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,735
what about...
societal structure?

322
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,420
Government.
No, there's
no need for one.

323
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,529
- You have no laws?
- No laws. No lawyers.

324
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:57,418
How do you know
right from wrong?

325
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:01,256
Every being
in the universe knows
right from wrong, Mark.

326
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:07,295
But what if--

327
00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:10,823
if someone did do
something wrong--

328
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:15,008
committed murder or rape--

329
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:17,261
how would you punish them?

330
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:23,044
Let me tell you
something, Mark.

331
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:25,745
You humans, most of you,

332
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:28,578
subscribe to this policy
of "an eye for an eye,

333
00:26:28,773 --> 00:26:31,093
a life for a life,"
which is known
throughout the universe...

334
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:33,117
for its stupidity.

335
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:35,718
Even your Buddha and your Christ
had quite a different vision,

336
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:39,506
but nobody's paid much attention
to them, not even the Buddhists
or the Christians.

337
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:44,729
You humans,

338
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:48,281
sometimes it's hard to imagine
how you've made it this far.

339
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:01,787
Josh, be careful.

340
00:27:03,353 --> 00:27:05,353
Okay, kids. Let's go.
The hot dogs are ready.

341
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:12,166
Hey. Where were you
just now?

342
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:15,873
Come on.
Okay.

343
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:21,084
Hey, kids, come on.
Wash up.

344
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:22,934
Okay!

345
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,824
Josh. Now come on,
quit teasing the dog.

346
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,209
Josh, let's go.
Settle down now.

347
00:27:30,426 --> 00:27:33,946
- Here we are.
- Oh, park that right here.

348
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:37,395
Boy,
that looks terrific.
That looks great.

349
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:39,198
Steve, how was, uh,
how was your trip
up from Princeton?

350
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:41,588
Steve, how was, uh,
how was your trip
up from Princeton?

351
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:45,333
Not too bad.
We even stopped by
to see Michael.

352
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:47,688
Oh, that was
nice of you, Sis.

353
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:49,782
Quite a detour
for you guys.

354
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:52,108
Well, it was his birthday.

355
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:54,686
I know it was his birthday.

356
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:57,549
I sent him a card
and a nice, uh,

357
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,591
a nice, big check
as usual.

358
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:02,673
It wouldn't kill you
to pick up the phone
every once in a while...

359
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:04,717
and talk to your own son.

360
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,680
Thank you, Abby.
You wanna pass
the potato salad, please?

361
00:28:09,928 --> 00:28:11,768
There you go.

362
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,210
By the way, I put him
through Dartmouth. He knows
how to pick up a phone too.

363
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:18,714
I'm thinking of inviting him
for Christmas.
Oh, great.

364
00:28:18,978 --> 00:28:22,338
He spends Christmas
with his mother.

365
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:25,728
He won't come here.
How do you know? When was
the last time you asked him?

366
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:28,147
Am I on the couch here,
or what?

367
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:30,804
You want a beer?
Please and thank you.

368
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:32,835
You want some more?
Can I have corn, darling?

369
00:28:38,209 --> 00:28:40,729
Steve, I, uh,

370
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:43,283
I have a rather unusual
favor to ask you.

371
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:45,946
What can I do you for,
Dr. "P''?
Well, I have a patient.

372
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:48,895
Sit down. I have
this patient, who, uh,

373
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:50,936
seems to know quite
a bit about your field.

374
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:53,298
A patient
who's an astronomer?

375
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:56,076
So, tell me about
this patient of yours.

376
00:28:56,311 --> 00:29:01,151
Well, he, uh, he claims
to come from a planet
he calls K-PAX.

377
00:29:01,444 --> 00:29:03,804
What kind of name
is that?
K-PAX?

378
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:09,149
He says it's a thousand
light-years away, near
the constellation Lyra.

379
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:12,772
Uh-huh. Bighead?
Green? About this high?

380
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:15,038
Yeah, I think
I know the guy.

381
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:17,969
No, he's, uh,
he's very convincing.

382
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:25,729
I mean, of course,
he's, uh, he's human.

383
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:27,809
It’s just that he's, um,

384
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:31,971
well, he's-he's the most
convincing delusional
I've ever come across.

385
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:36,588
If I can prove to him
that this K-PAX is just
a figment of his imagination,

386
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,939
then maybe I can find out
who he really is.

387
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,953
Well, sure.
I can give you...

388
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,518
a whole list of questions
to ask your fella.
Wonderful.

389
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,186
All his books and papers
and everything...

390
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:55,133
are spread all over the desk
like always, but he's
just sitting there.

391
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,260
Someone change
his medication?

392
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:01,144
I gave him his usual,
Anafronil, 250 milligrams.

393
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,728
Hmm. Well, something's
wrong with him.

394
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:13,735
An obsessive-compulsive
doesn't just sit there
looking out the window.

395
00:30:22,408 --> 00:30:24,248
Howie?

396
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:31,568
Good morning,
Dr. Powell.

397
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:35,993
Good morning.
But are you looking
for something?

398
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:38,095
Bluebird.

399
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:40,218
The bluebird?

400
00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:42,267
The bluebird of happiness.

401
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:47,687
Prot told me to find
the bluebird of happiness.

402
00:30:47,895 --> 00:30:50,455
Prot told you.

403
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,490
It's a task.

404
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:54,492
The first of three.

405
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:59,248
I don't know what
the other two are yet.

406
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:02,051
He'll tell me.

407
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:06,084
If I complete all three,

408
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:08,172
I'll be cured.

409
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:23,061
There.
Maintain your breathing.

410
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,630
That's it.
Now you see?

411
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:28,172
There are none of
these ammonia particles
that you're so worried about.

412
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:31,277
In the first place,
I would be able to see them.
Good morning, Sal.

413
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:33,326
And I don't.
Good morning, Dr. Stinky.

414
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:35,929
Ringed monkey, 7:00.

415
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:42,378
Take a bath.
Take a bath.

416
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,900
Ernie, could you excuse us
for a moment, please?
Mm-hmm.

417
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:48,006
Good to, uh,
see you outside, Ernie.

418
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:51,249
Thank you.
Oh, Ernie, you stink.

419
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:54,624
Prot, it's one thing
to take an interest
in your fellow patients.

420
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:57,763
It's quite another
to make them think
that you can cure them.

421
00:31:57,972 --> 00:31:59,852
You seem overly upset,
Mark.

422
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:03,418
To borrow a phrase from Navarro,
You need to chill.

423
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,768
For your information,
all beings have the capacity
to cure themselves, Mark.

424
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:09,581
This is something
we've known on K-PAX
for millions of years.

425
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:13,737
Listen to me.
On this planet,
I'm a doctor, you're a patient.

426
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,672
Doctor. Patient.
Curious human distinction.

427
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:20,752
It's not your job
to cure Howie.

428
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:23,835
Or Ernie or Maria
or anyone else.
It's mine.

429
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,042
Then why haven't
You cured them yet?

430
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:32,656
Oh, by the way,
here are the answers
to the questions you asked me.

431
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:37,564
I hope they meet
Your satisfaction.

432
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:54,205
I don't know what to say, Mark.

433
00:32:54,366 --> 00:32:57,926
I mean, this is--
this is pretty wild stuff.

434
00:32:58,162 --> 00:33:02,002
Gibberish, huh?
Well, not exactly.

435
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:04,453
I mean, see,

436
00:33:04,668 --> 00:33:07,388
Your patient indicates
his planet, K-PAX,

437
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:11,472
orbitingan eclipsing
binary star system--
Agape and Satori.

438
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:14,361
Yeah.
Near the Constellation Lyra.

439
00:33:14,597 --> 00:33:16,597
He could have
looked that up, right?

440
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:20,732
That's the funny thing, Mark.
Not really.

441
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:24,701
I mean, except for my boss,
Duncan Flynn,

442
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:27,703
one of the foremost
astrophysicists in the world...

443
00:33:27,904 --> 00:33:32,064
and maybe two or three
of his colleagues,

444
00:33:32,368 --> 00:33:35,488
nobody knows much about
the possibility of planets
in this star system yet.

445
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:38,063
It hasn't even been reported
in any journals.

446
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,936
Tell me, honestly,

447
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:44,092
did Duncan put you
up to this?

448
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:46,777
You know--
You know, like a joke?

449
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:50,529
No. It's no joke, Steve.

450
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:52,926
Uh, tell me,

451
00:33:53,142 --> 00:33:56,262
do you know of any missing
astrophysicists?

452
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,839
Can't say I do.

453
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:03,545
But there's one or two
around here who'd sure like
to meet this fella of yours.

454
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,179
Thanks a lot, Steve.
I sure appreciate it.

455
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,030
But unlike you humans,
the reproductive process...

456
00:34:15,247 --> 00:34:17,087
is an unpleasant one for us.
Start again.

457
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:20,847
What way is it unpleasant?

458
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:22,846
It's a pain--

459
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,799
Good. Not too fast.
Okay.

460
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:48,911
So, this is
Your neighborhood, huh?

461
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,850
Hello, gentlemen.
Sure appreciate you
meeting with us.

462
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:04,138
Thank you, Dr. Powell.
We'd like to get to the bottom
of this just as much as you.

463
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:08,315
Thank you, Doctor.
Great. Let me introduce
You to Prot.

464
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:13,488
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Prot.
I'm Dr. Becker.

465
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,138
This is Dr. Flynn.

466
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:18,683
Drs. Patel and Hessler.

467
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:24,898
Doctor. Doctor.
Doctor. Doctor.

468
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,580
How many doctors
are there on this planet?

469
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:49,215
Here, Prot.
Have a seat.

470
00:37:49,486 --> 00:37:52,486
"Have a seat.''
Oh, shit!

471
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:57,029
Feel at home?

472
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,091
We found your notes
quite interesting, Prot,

473
00:38:04,294 --> 00:38:07,294
and we'd like to ask you
some questions,
if that's all right.

474
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:10,545
Be my guest.
Good.
Then I’ll jump right in.

475
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:12,961
Make sure you can swim.

476
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:15,419
Yes, well,

477
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,999
let's start with this idea
of light travel, shall we?

478
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,729
What can you tell us
about that?

479
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:26,617
Absolutely nothing.

480
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:29,178
If I told you,
you'd blow yourselves up.

481
00:38:29,364 --> 00:38:31,244
Or worse,
someone else.

482
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:34,367
You'd be surprised
how much energy
is in a beam of light.

483
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:37,538
Hmm. Well, then,

484
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:42,229
maybe you could show us
how this light travel works.

485
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,139
You mean a demonstration.

486
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:49,901
That would be... fine.

487
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,448
Adios. Aloha.

488
00:39:07,363 --> 00:39:10,443
Well, when are you gonna--
I'm already back.

489
00:39:14,498 --> 00:39:18,058
See, where I come from, Prot,
that's called "the fastest gun
in the West'' routine.

490
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:21,611
Well, I don't come from
where you come from,
Dr. Becker.

491
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,290
Prot, you've indicated in your
notes that your planet K-PAX...

492
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,270
orbits around the twin stars
of Agape and Satori,
near the constellation Lyra.

493
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:33,355
Well, frankly,
we're a bit mystified...

494
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:37,438
as to how you gained knowledge
there's such a planetary system
around these stars.

495
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:40,331
Professor, where I come from,
that's common knowledge.

496
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:45,445
This was taken
from the Hubble.

497
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:50,451
We've computer enhanced it,
based on Dr. Patel's readings...

498
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:52,823
from telescopes
in Chile and Hawaii.

499
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:57,597
It's the clearest picture
we have of where you come from.

500
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:04,343
What we'd like is if you could
diagram on the light pad...

501
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:08,115
the orbital pattern
that your planet takes
through this system.

502
00:40:13,563 --> 00:40:16,163
Mm-hmm.
My pleasure.

503
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:16,471
I think that's right.

504
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:20,922
Steven,
could you input that?

505
00:41:21,137 --> 00:41:22,617
Already on it.

506
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:28,307
Wh-What's going on?

507
00:41:57,468 --> 00:42:00,868
I take it my calculations
help explain the "protabations"
You've been seeing...

508
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:03,818
in the rotation pattern
of your binary star,

509
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:09,060
but have been unable to explain
until... this moment.

510
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:20,707
How--

511
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,870
How could you know this?

512
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:26,938
How could you--

513
00:42:27,126 --> 00:42:29,206
Every K-PAXian knows this.

514
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:32,837
Just as every child
on Earth knows...

515
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:36,329
that your planet
revolves around your sun.

516
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,836
It's common knowledge.
Isn't it?

517
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,830
What, um,
what happened in there?

518
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,919
I mean, you--

519
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,005
He could be a savant.

520
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,650
There-There are savants
who have painted flawless
copies of Rembrandt,

521
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:12,563
who couldn't--
who couldn't remember
their own names.

522
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:17,015
You don't
believe him, Steve.

523
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:23,831
I don't know
what I believe, Mark,
but I know what I saw.

524
00:43:32,656 --> 00:43:36,016
I moved. I moved.
It's your move.

525
00:43:36,285 --> 00:43:39,125
One and two. Your move.

526
00:43:46,215 --> 00:43:48,015
Bluebird.

527
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,268
Bluebird.

528
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:55,271
You just wait
till next game.
Bluebird.

529
00:43:57,476 --> 00:44:00,756
Bluebird! Bluebird!

530
00:44:02,023 --> 00:44:05,423
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

531
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:08,653
Howie!
Bluebird! Bluebird!

532
00:44:08,904 --> 00:44:12,144
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

533
00:44:12,408 --> 00:44:15,248
Howie.
Bluebird. Bluebird.
Bluebird.

534
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:17,813
Okay. Okay.
Bluebird!

535
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:19,841
Where's the bluebird?

536
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,840
Look, bluebird!
Bluebird! Bluebird!

537
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:24,969
Oh, my God.

538
00:44:28,677 --> 00:44:32,117
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Howie!
Howie, get back here!

539
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,950
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

540
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:38,107
Do bluebirds bite, Sal?

541
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,830
Nah, they don't bite,
stinkhead.

542
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:47,649
Hey, Bess, it’s a bluebird.

543
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:53,226
- Shit!
- Disturbance on two.

544
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:59,761
- It's the bluebird!
- Bluebird! Bluebird!

545
00:45:00,003 --> 00:45:02,083
Bluebird! Bluebird!

546
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:14,733
Bluebird! Bluebird!

547
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,436
It's mass hysteria.

548
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:25,692
Betty!
Betty, what the hell
is going on here?

549
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:29,393
- Come here! Come here!
- Dr. Powell, come and see!

550
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:34,142
You see it?
Do you see it?

551
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:37,059
Lookit! Lookit!
Lookit!

552
00:45:37,296 --> 00:45:41,296
What’s going on here,
Dr. Powell?
What on Earth is out there?

553
00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:44,909
-Just a bluejay.
- A bluejay?

554
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,209
A bluejay.

555
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,934
Off the chair.
Everybody, get off the chairs.

556
00:45:56,149 --> 00:46:00,029
Mrs. Archer...
come out of her room.

557
00:46:05,368 --> 00:46:07,168
Bluebird?

558
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:13,341
It’s a bluebird?

559
00:46:15,212 --> 00:46:17,012
Come on over here.

560
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:02,057
I know who you are.

561
00:47:04,975 --> 00:47:07,695
You're the bluebird.

562
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:15,714
Good night, Bess.

563
00:47:21,535 --> 00:47:24,255
And how are we today?
Oh, just fine.

564
00:47:24,456 --> 00:47:27,456
That's good, Maria.
My man.

565
00:47:35,592 --> 00:47:36,912
Psst.

566
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:51,675
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.

567
00:47:58,535 --> 00:48:01,855
About that
light travel thing.

568
00:48:02,122 --> 00:48:05,362
I was wondering if maybe
You could show me
how to do that.

569
00:48:10,714 --> 00:48:14,794
I put up with
the stinkin this place
for ten years.

570
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:18,053
I wanna get out,
if you know what I mean.

571
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:22,829
I used to be the doorman
at The Plaza.

572
00:48:23,062 --> 00:48:25,102
F-Fifteen years.

573
00:48:25,315 --> 00:48:27,555
That's when I started
to notice it.

574
00:48:28,861 --> 00:48:32,061
Notice what?
The smell.

575
00:48:32,322 --> 00:48:34,522
They all stank.

576
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,020
I-I tried to tell 'em,
but, uh,

577
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:41,570
they put me here.

578
00:48:41,748 --> 00:48:44,108
And, um, and-and--

579
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:49,839
And this-this place
smells worse than all.

580
00:48:50,132 --> 00:48:52,692
Except foryou.
Y-You don't smell,

581
00:48:52,885 --> 00:48:55,925
so I figured maybe
You could help me.

582
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:02,474
You should smell
the york blossoms
on my planet...

583
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,930
in a gentle breeze.

584
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,429
Pretty much
like your sugarplums.

585
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,454
I would-- I would
like to smell that.

586
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:17,698
I would like to go there,
to-to your, um,

587
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:19,796
planet.

588
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:23,876
I'm afraid I can only take
one person back with me
when I go.

589
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:31,563
Uh, I had my weekly session
with Sal today.

590
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,644
He says you're
taking him to K-PAX.

591
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:36,610
In fact, I've heard
from most of the patients
on ward two,

592
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:39,452
they all tell me
that they're going to K-PAX.

593
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,970
I wonder if that’s a wise thing
to be promising patients
in a psychiatric facility.

594
00:49:43,235 --> 00:49:46,195
No, no, no, Mark.
I made it clear to each
and every one of them,

595
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:49,005
I can only take one person
back with me when I return.

596
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,960
Return?
Mark,
don't get me wrong.

597
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:54,921
I mean, you've been
very hospitable.

598
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:58,042
Hospital.
Hospitable.

599
00:49:58,292 --> 00:50:01,692
But my time here is almost up,
and I can't wait to get back.
Back?

600
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:04,401
To K-PAX?
Yes, of course.
Where else?

601
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,470
You're planning
to return to K-PAX.

602
00:50:06,634 --> 00:50:09,714
You're repeating yourself
again, Mark. Yes, I have
one trip to take up north,

603
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:12,332
and then I am planning
on returning to K-PAX.

604
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,079
Joyce gave me these strawberries
this morning from her garden
in Hoboken.

605
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:18,591
They're delicious.
You'll have to
forgive me, but, um,

606
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:20,936
but this is
a bit confusing.

607
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:24,028
- When are you planning on--
- I'm departing on July 27.

608
00:50:24,237 --> 00:50:28,197
Why? Why, uh,
why July 27?

609
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,332
Safety reasons.

610
00:50:30,493 --> 00:50:33,133
You see, I can go anywhere
on Earth without fear
of bumping into someone...

611
00:50:33,371 --> 00:50:37,211
traveling at super light speed,
but beings are coming and going
all the time from K-PAX.

612
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,741
It has to be coordinated.

613
00:50:41,963 --> 00:50:43,803
You're telling me...

614
00:50:43,968 --> 00:50:47,648
You're beaming back
to K-PAX on July 27.

615
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:50,891
At 5:51 a.m.,
Eastern time.

616
00:51:11,371 --> 00:51:13,971
Hey, hey, hey, honey.

617
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:16,848
Mark,
You were just dreaming.

618
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:19,087
You were just dreaming.

619
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:26,351
Daddy?
Mark.

620
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,356
Mark, what’s going on?
Daddy's okay.

621
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,358
Go back to bed, honey.
Where is Daddy going?

622
00:51:30,518 --> 00:51:32,358
Daddy's all right.
He has a tummy ache.
He's all right.

623
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,360
Daddy!
Get in bed!

624
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,644
And when did you arrive
on Earth?

625
00:51:36,818 --> 00:51:38,738
Four years and nine months ago.
What's going on?

626
00:51:38,904 --> 00:51:42,344
Shh! Listen.

627
00:51:42,615 --> 00:51:44,655
And when did you arrive
on Earth?

628
00:51:44,826 --> 00:51:46,666
Four years and nine months ago.

629
00:51:46,828 --> 00:51:48,708
Your years.

630
00:51:50,831 --> 00:51:53,631
Four years, nine months
and three days ago.

631
00:51:53,837 --> 00:51:57,597
That'll be five years
to the date on July 27.
That's when he's leaving.

632
00:51:57,842 --> 00:52:00,762
What?
To go back to K-PAX.

633
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,330
Mark, what is the matter
with you?

634
00:52:03,514 --> 00:52:05,354
Rachel--
Mark, it is 2:00
in the morning.

635
00:52:05,517 --> 00:52:07,357
What is-- What is
this patient doing to you?

636
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,000
He's telling me
that five years ago
on July 27...

637
00:52:10,188 --> 00:52:12,028
something terrible
happened to him.

638
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:16,390
Some horrible trauma.
I gotta get to him
before that date.

639
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:19,376
- Mom, what's happening?
- Unbelievable.

640
00:52:19,573 --> 00:52:21,893
Nothing. Come on.
Come on. Let's all
go back to bed.

641
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:26,163
Ah, I've got it!

642
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:28,212
Come on. Let's eat.

643
00:52:31,086 --> 00:52:34,046
- Is the spaceman here yet?
- Shh. Don't call him that.

644
00:52:34,299 --> 00:52:36,979
Spaceman. Spaceman.
No, no. No, no.

645
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:39,739
Whoo!
Everybody, come here.

646
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,930
Listen, everybody, look.
He's going to be here
any minute.

647
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:45,739
I want you guys to just
calm down. Be yourselves.
Act natural.

648
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,380
Okay. Spaceman.

649
00:52:48,606 --> 00:52:52,206
Why, is he going to zap us
with his laser gun?

650
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:55,003
I mean it. I do.
Here.

651
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,238
Oh, Mom.

652
00:52:57,406 --> 00:52:59,246
I can't believe
I agreed to this.

653
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:01,248
I tried everything else.
Rachel, look.

654
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,690
I want him to spend
Fourth of July with us...

655
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:06,355
to see if a normal family
environment might bring
something out of him.

656
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:08,464
Since when did we become
a normal family?

657
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,710
Please.
Look. They're here.

658
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:14,443
I just feel uncomfortable.
Well, don't.

659
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:16,996
Joyce's son, he's on
the high school wrestling team,

660
00:53:17,221 --> 00:53:19,141
and Betty's husband's
an ex-cop.

661
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:22,108
Hey!
Hi.

662
00:53:22,308 --> 00:53:24,748
Hey, Joyce.
Hey, buddy.

663
00:53:24,938 --> 00:53:27,618
Glad you could make it.

664
00:53:27,815 --> 00:53:30,295
Wow.
This is my husband, Dominic.

665
00:53:30,486 --> 00:53:33,126
He looks like Data.
That's right,
embarrass him.

666
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Welcome, Prot.

667
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:38,092
This is my wife Rachel.

668
00:53:41,998 --> 00:53:45,518
How do you do?
Rachel.

669
00:53:45,794 --> 00:53:48,154
Thank you so much
for inviting me today.

670
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:50,099
Thanks for coming.

671
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:54,573
- Watch out. Watch out.
- No.

672
00:53:54,803 --> 00:53:59,043
Shasta, no.
Shasta, no.
Shasta!

673
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:02,549
Come here, good dog.
I know. I know.

674
00:54:02,811 --> 00:54:05,451
Damn dog's
never liked anyone.
Shh.

675
00:54:05,649 --> 00:54:08,889
Oh. Okay. Kids.

676
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:13,234
Girls. Girls.
Come here.

677
00:54:24,503 --> 00:54:26,343
Okay.

678
00:54:26,506 --> 00:54:29,386
She says she doesn't
like it when you hide
her favorite tennis shoe.

679
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:32,354
And she doesn't hear so well
in her left side, so--

680
00:54:32,594 --> 00:54:34,434
so don't sneak up
on her anymore.

681
00:54:34,597 --> 00:54:37,597
No way.

682
00:54:42,689 --> 00:54:44,889
Let's get some lunch, okay?
Let's have lunch.

683
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:53,001
Let's go eat.

684
00:55:02,378 --> 00:55:05,658
It's good, Rachel.

685
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:07,802
Okay, you guys, come on.

686
00:55:07,968 --> 00:55:10,248
Careful, careful,
Gabby.

687
00:55:13,514 --> 00:55:15,474
All right. Come on.
Somebody else
want some?

688
00:55:15,684 --> 00:55:18,044
There we go.

689
00:55:20,147 --> 00:55:23,027
So, Prot, Mark tells me
You don't eat meat.

690
00:55:23,234 --> 00:55:25,194
That's very healthy.
Speak for yourself.

691
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,285
Burger.
Burger.

692
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,330
You got it?

693
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,173
Yes, I want burgers,
thank you.
It's good.

694
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:35,571
Everything looks so good.
Pass me one of those hamburgers.

695
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,317
Come on.

696
00:55:56,688 --> 00:55:58,528
Give me a push.

697
00:57:38,009 --> 00:57:42,209
There's a photograph
on the piano of a young man
with all the others.

698
00:57:42,512 --> 00:57:44,312
That's Michael.

699
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:47,074
That's Mark's son
from his first marriage.

700
00:57:48,354 --> 00:57:50,154
How many marriages
has he had?

701
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:54,077
Just the two...
so far.

702
00:57:56,154 --> 00:57:57,954
"So far”?
No, I mean,

703
00:57:58,157 --> 00:58:00,277
he's not out to set
a world record or anything.

704
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,965
But the young man
in the photograph,
he's not here today.

705
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:09,622
No, um,
he doesn't live with us.

706
00:58:09,794 --> 00:58:11,874
You know,
he's away at college and--

707
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:16,290
and the truth is,
he and Mark don't
talk to each other.

708
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,835
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

709
00:58:21,058 --> 00:58:24,138
Probably because
I'm a locked-up lunatic,
so what harm could it do.

710
00:58:24,394 --> 00:58:27,594
Maybe.

711
00:58:29,525 --> 00:58:31,365
Maybe that's it.

712
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:37,571
Dr. Powell's been trying
to teach me the importance...

713
00:58:37,784 --> 00:58:41,464
You beings place on
Your biological connections.
Hmm.

714
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:44,711
You think he means it?

715
00:58:47,044 --> 00:58:48,884
You don't?

716
00:58:53,758 --> 00:58:55,558
Do you know
what a family is?

717
00:58:57,139 --> 00:58:59,939
You worry.

718
00:59:00,142 --> 00:59:03,462
They don't
tell you that, you know.

719
00:59:07,649 --> 00:59:09,489
You don't have a family.

720
00:59:12,531 --> 00:59:14,371
No.

721
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:20,282
We don't have families
on K-PAX.

722
00:59:22,998 --> 00:59:26,718
Well, you don't know
what you're missing.

723
00:59:32,972 --> 00:59:34,772
I'll get you
some more lemonade.

724
00:59:41,356 --> 00:59:44,676
All right.
Incoming.

725
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,340
That's beautiful.
Thank you.

726
00:59:48,613 --> 00:59:51,213
Fourth ofJuly.

727
00:59:51,449 --> 00:59:54,529
Thank you for inviting me
here today, Mark.

728
00:59:54,784 --> 00:59:56,664
You're most welcome, Prot.

729
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,160
Come push me on the swing!

730
01:00:03,127 --> 01:00:05,087
I'll show you
a trick.

731
01:00:05,295 --> 01:00:07,095
This is called...

732
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,180
Go to the Table
and Have a Beer.

733
01:00:12,807 --> 01:00:14,647
Okay.

734
01:00:14,807 --> 01:00:16,847
But first you have to
hold on very tight.

735
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,020
Okay.
Ready?

736
01:00:24,986 --> 01:00:27,266
This is fun!

737
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:36,915
Come on, let's go!
Come on! Come on!

738
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:39,001
Watch out.
Watch out.

739
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:53,668
Let's go in the water!

740
01:00:53,892 --> 01:00:55,692
No, don't.
Come on!

741
01:00:55,894 --> 01:00:59,094
No, don't go.
Don't go.
Let's go!

742
01:00:59,357 --> 01:01:02,077
Hey! Let go!
Don't go in the water!
Don't! No, don't!

743
01:01:02,278 --> 01:01:04,198
Mom! No!
No, you stay! No!

744
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:06,281
Natalie? Natalie!

745
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:09,126
Mark! Mark!

746
01:01:09,368 --> 01:01:12,008
Prot!

747
01:01:12,246 --> 01:01:15,006
Hey, this guy's
as strong as an ox!
Betty, quick!

748
01:01:15,248 --> 01:01:18,648
Turn off the goddamn water!

749
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:21,841
Stay there, Josh.
I'll turn it off!
I got it.

750
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:24,492
It's okay.

751
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:27,598
Prot?

752
01:01:27,805 --> 01:01:32,285
It's okay. It's okay.
No, no, no, it's okay, Betty.
Where are his glasses?

753
01:01:32,603 --> 01:01:34,683
I got it.
Are you all right?

754
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:38,015
Prot?

755
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:43,535
You're okay.

756
01:01:47,325 --> 01:01:49,125
Is that apple pie I smell?

757
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:01,076
Sweetheart,
You all right?
Yeah.

758
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:05,421
He was pushing my daughter
on a swing, like he had done
a hundred times before.

759
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,560
Not like he was
some alien from K-PAX.

760
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:13,334
I saw him.
He was connecting
with something.

761
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,924
Some kind
of normal life.
That's not enough.

762
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,948
He's a violent patient,
Mark.

763
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,230
He's not violent.

764
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:23,526
Something violent
happened to him.
Something in his past.

765
01:02:23,784 --> 01:02:27,224
When he was going after Natalie,
he wasn't trying to harm her,
he was trying to protect her.

766
01:02:27,496 --> 01:02:31,416
From the sprinklers?
I'm not sure from what.

767
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:35,711
I need more than a hunch
to go on, otherwise I
have to send him upstairs.

768
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,726
We need to regress him--
take him back into the past,

769
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:41,527
find out what happened
and have him confront it.

770
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,160
Regress him? Do you have any
idea how risky it is to regress
a patient like this one?

771
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:48,675
It's his only chance.

772
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:51,614
Claudia,
we have to push him.
There's no time.

773
01:02:51,857 --> 01:02:54,457
He told me
that he's going back
to K-PAX on July 27.

774
01:02:54,692 --> 01:02:56,772
That's in three weeks.

775
01:02:56,944 --> 01:03:01,424
I think that he could
become violent on that day.
Hurt himself, somebody else.

776
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:04,184
You know what
the problem is, Mark.

777
01:03:04,412 --> 01:03:05,972
You're too close
to this patient.

778
01:03:06,164 --> 01:03:08,764
Everybody else
can see it but you.

779
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:11,681
I am transferring him
to the fourth floor,
and that's final.

780
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:14,881
I know I'm too close to him.
All right, fine.
I admit it.

781
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,930
Why choose this one
to save, Mark?

782
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:21,692
I don't know. Maybe--
Maybe because I feel...

783
01:03:21,973 --> 01:03:23,813
he chose me.

784
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,407
Has anyone seen Prot?

785
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,837
He went up north
for a few days.

786
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:40,634
"North''?
Greenland.

787
01:03:40,913 --> 01:03:42,713
Iceland.

788
01:03:42,915 --> 01:03:44,995
You know.

789
01:03:45,207 --> 01:03:48,967
He had a few countries
left to visit before he
could finish his report.

790
01:03:49,212 --> 01:03:52,012
Don't worry, Dr. Powell.
He'll be back.

791
01:03:52,215 --> 01:03:54,895
How do you know, Ernie?

792
01:03:55,134 --> 01:03:57,134
Because he took his glasses
with him, darling.

793
01:03:57,304 --> 01:03:59,784
When he returns to K-PAX,
he won't need them.

794
01:04:09,608 --> 01:04:12,448
Patients do not escape
from this institution.
They don't escape.

795
01:04:12,697 --> 01:04:14,657
There has been
no evidence of escape,

796
01:04:14,823 --> 01:04:17,743
but obviously,
I've notified the police,
social services.

797
01:04:17,994 --> 01:04:20,914
I'm gonna have a great time
explaining this
to the state board.

798
01:04:21,164 --> 01:04:23,204
I got psychotics
on the fourth floor
packing up their sneakers...

799
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:25,216
because they all think
they're going off to K-PAX.

800
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:27,216
Claudia--
Find him.

801
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,770
Well, what about
city shelters?

802
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:39,774
Have you--
Have you checked?

803
01:04:41,895 --> 01:04:43,735
No.

804
01:04:43,897 --> 01:04:47,257
No, I'm not telling you
how to do your job.

805
01:04:47,527 --> 01:04:50,127
Uh-- Thank--
Thank you.

806
01:05:40,585 --> 01:05:42,625
Dr. Powell,
I presume.

807
01:05:42,837 --> 01:05:45,277
Where the hell
have you been?

808
01:05:45,505 --> 01:05:48,665
Newfoundland,
Greenland, Iceland,
uh, Labrador--

809
01:05:48,926 --> 01:05:52,166
All right, cut the crap.
We've been looking for you
for three days.

810
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:55,830
I believe I mentioned
my taking a trip up north,
Mark, in this very garden.

811
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,020
"Taking a trip”?
You're a patient here.

812
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:01,910
You don't leave here without
a discharge. And don't give me
this beam-of-light shit,

813
01:06:02,151 --> 01:06:04,551
because I don't buy it.

814
01:06:06,488 --> 01:06:08,368
What would you say
if I were to tell you...

815
01:06:08,533 --> 01:06:10,613
that I don't believe
You took any trip at all...

816
01:06:10,785 --> 01:06:12,625
to Iceland or Greenland
or anywhere?

817
01:06:12,788 --> 01:06:16,708
That I don't believe
You're from K-PAX?

818
01:06:16,957 --> 01:06:19,677
I believe you're
as human as I am.

819
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:22,599
I would say you're in need
of a Thorazine drip, Doctor.

820
01:06:27,427 --> 01:06:30,627
Well, there--
there is one way...

821
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:33,490
You could convince me
beyond any doubt.

822
01:06:33,686 --> 01:06:36,006
Of course,
I would need your consent.

823
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,030
It's called hypnosis.

824
01:06:38,232 --> 01:06:41,672
I just don't see the point.
Let me tell you
what your alternative is.

825
01:06:41,945 --> 01:06:45,185
A trip to a place
where they'll stick a needle
in your ass every morning,

826
01:06:45,447 --> 01:06:47,367
which may or may not leave you
with a stupid grin
on your face...

827
01:06:47,575 --> 01:06:49,415
for the rest of your days
here on Earth.

828
01:06:49,577 --> 01:06:52,297
Is that what you'd like?

829
01:06:52,498 --> 01:06:54,738
Prot?

830
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:56,759
I want to help you.

831
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:04,361
What we're going
to be doing, Prot,
is a bit like daydreaming.

832
01:07:04,678 --> 01:07:07,478
I'm gonna count
from one to five.

833
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,480
On the count of three,
Your eyes will close,

834
01:07:10,685 --> 01:07:13,085
and you will find yourself
in a very nice, deep,

835
01:07:13,314 --> 01:07:16,074
comfortable, relaxed
state of hypnosis.

836
01:07:17,983 --> 01:07:23,103
One. Your eyes are starting
to get very heavy now.

837
01:07:24,618 --> 01:07:26,898
Two. I want you
to use your imagination...

838
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:31,157
and imagine small lead weights
on your eyelids...

839
01:07:31,457 --> 01:07:35,897
that are just making them
so... heavy.

840
01:07:36,211 --> 01:07:38,091
Pulse rate is 40 B.P.M.
Three.

841
01:07:38,298 --> 01:07:40,098
Keep your eyes closed.
I'd be concerned
if he were human.

842
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,940
Let yourself go way,
way down deep.

843
01:07:45,225 --> 01:07:49,985
Four. Let a wave of relaxation
move through your body now...

844
01:07:50,312 --> 01:07:53,112
as you go down
even deeper.

845
01:07:53,357 --> 01:07:55,237
And five,

846
01:07:55,444 --> 01:08:00,324
going way, way down deep.

847
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:03,776
You are in a relaxed
state of hypnosis now.

848
01:08:05,037 --> 01:08:06,837
How do you feel?

849
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,480
Like...

850
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:13,510
nothing.

851
01:08:14,713 --> 01:08:17,273
I want you
to go back in time.

852
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:23,940
I want you to recall
the first experience
that you can remember.

853
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:26,068
What do you see?

854
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:30,612
What was that?

855
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:33,947
What do you see?

856
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,540
Uh--

857
01:08:41,995 --> 01:08:44,635
I see...

858
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,670
casket.

859
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,341
Silver...

860
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:53,929
with a blue lining.

861
01:08:55,677 --> 01:08:57,717
Whose casket is it?

862
01:09:00,306 --> 01:09:03,226
It's the father
of a friend of mine.

863
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:05,837
What's your friend's name?

864
01:09:07,646 --> 01:09:09,446
I'm not telling.

865
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:15,052
Do you know how
Your friend's father died?

866
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:20,572
He had an accident at
the place that he worked at.

867
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:23,548
He was killed
in an accident?

868
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:27,630
He-- He was hurt
and then died later?

869
01:09:27,918 --> 01:09:31,278
Where did he work?
The place where
they kill cows.

870
01:09:31,508 --> 01:09:33,348
Where is this place?

871
01:09:36,637 --> 01:09:39,237
The pulse rate just shot up
ten B.P.M.s.

872
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:44,075
Do you know--
Do you know
where this place is?

873
01:09:49,651 --> 01:09:51,691
I-I want you to relax.

874
01:09:52,947 --> 01:09:55,827
I want to move forward
in time now.

875
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:00,908
Where are you?

876
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:04,812
It's nighttime.

877
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:06,846
We're in his house.

878
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:10,166
At the other boy's house?
Yeah.

879
01:10:10,383 --> 01:10:12,223
I want him
to come outside.

880
01:10:12,386 --> 01:10:14,426
Why?

881
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:20,638
To look at the stars.

882
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:24,748
That's where I come from,
You know.

883
01:10:26,984 --> 01:10:28,784
Is your name Prot?

884
01:10:31,614 --> 01:10:33,454
Wow.

885
01:10:33,617 --> 01:10:35,617
How did you know that?

886
01:10:35,828 --> 01:10:38,148
Where are you from, Prot?

887
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,450
I'm from the planet K-PAX.

888
01:10:42,628 --> 01:10:44,748
It's in
the constellation Lyra.

889
01:10:44,923 --> 01:10:47,443
Do you know
all the constellations?

890
01:10:47,674 --> 01:10:50,514
Yeah. Most of 'em.

891
01:10:50,761 --> 01:10:54,281
And does your friend
know them too?
Yes, he does.

892
01:10:54,558 --> 01:10:57,598
When his dad got sick
and had to stay home,
they got a telescope,

893
01:10:57,809 --> 01:11:01,649
and his dad taught him about
all the constellations.

894
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:07,019
But he's not interested
in those right now.

895
01:11:07,278 --> 01:11:09,518
Why not?

896
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:12,380
Something happened.

897
01:11:12,618 --> 01:11:15,458
That's why he called me.

898
01:11:15,707 --> 01:11:18,307
He calls me when
something bad happens.

899
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,342
Like when his father died?

900
01:11:22,464 --> 01:11:24,224
That's right.

901
01:11:25,884 --> 01:11:29,084
How do you know to come?
How does the boy call you?

902
01:11:29,303 --> 01:11:33,183
I don't know. I just come.
I just-- I just know.

903
01:11:33,476 --> 01:11:35,356
How do you get to Earth?

904
01:11:35,561 --> 01:11:38,921
I wanna go outside.
Can I go outside?

905
01:11:39,148 --> 01:11:40,988
Uh, read-- read
his body language, Mark.

906
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:43,590
I-I don't think he wants
to talk anymore today.

907
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,620
All right. Prot?

908
01:11:45,822 --> 01:11:48,422
I want you
to just relax now.

909
01:11:48,657 --> 01:11:51,097
Think about the stars.

910
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:56,834
That's right.
I' m gonna count backwards now
from five to one,

911
01:11:57,126 --> 01:12:00,326
and you'll find yourself
wide-awake and refreshed.

912
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:04,070
Five. You're starting
to come out of it now.

913
01:12:04,344 --> 01:12:06,544
Four.
You're feeling more alert.

914
01:12:06,762 --> 01:12:08,802
Three.
Even more alert.

915
01:12:09,014 --> 01:12:11,494
Two.
You're becoming awake now.

916
01:12:11,683 --> 01:12:13,523
And one.

917
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:19,949
So when do we begin?

918
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:21,991
It's already over.

919
01:12:25,952 --> 01:12:29,352
Oh, the old "fastest gun
in the West'' routine, huh?

920
01:12:36,046 --> 01:12:40,806
Let's find the locations
of all the slaughter houses
operating in the United States.

921
01:12:41,092 --> 01:12:44,292
I mean, how many
can there be?

922
01:12:44,554 --> 01:12:46,354
I don't know.

923
01:12:46,557 --> 01:12:50,037
We eliminate, uh, the ones
in or near big cities...

924
01:12:50,309 --> 01:12:54,549
and we concentrate
on small towns, rural areas,

925
01:12:54,856 --> 01:12:58,816
You know, places where
You can see the stars.

926
01:13:00,572 --> 01:13:03,292
Joyce, we only have
six days.

927
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:09,361
Shall I bring the crystal
or leave it here?

928
01:13:09,581 --> 01:13:12,341
I suppose I won't
really need it on K-PAX.

929
01:13:12,585 --> 01:13:15,465
I don't even know
what they drink.

930
01:13:15,713 --> 01:13:18,713
Dream on, sister.
He can only take
one of us with him.

931
01:13:18,925 --> 01:13:21,845
Why the hell would he take
a stinker like you?
He's taking me.

932
01:13:22,095 --> 01:13:25,375
How dare you!
I do not stink.

933
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:27,799
Nah, forget it, ho.
I'm the one goin'.

934
01:13:28,017 --> 01:13:30,217
Yeah?
Which one of you?

935
01:13:30,438 --> 01:13:33,918
Okay.
Who would like to begin?

936
01:13:34,192 --> 01:13:38,352
Ernie.
Uh, I-I was-- I was wondering
if it was possible...

937
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:40,773
for us to have Cream of Wheat
instead of oatmeal.

938
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,470
Not again.
Howie.

939
01:13:43,704 --> 01:13:46,904
I have a suggestion,
because there's really,
really not much time.

940
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:50,125
I would like to propose
an essay contest...

941
01:13:50,377 --> 01:13:53,897
to decide once and for all
who will go with Prot.

942
01:13:54,132 --> 01:13:59,612
I've spoken with him,
and he's agreed to read
them all by July 27.

943
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,690
So if anyone would
like to be considered,

944
01:14:01,889 --> 01:14:04,969
please state your reasons
in a clear, legible hand...

945
01:14:05,184 --> 01:14:08,184
and return them to me.

946
01:14:08,437 --> 01:14:11,357
Russell.

947
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:13,970
Yes?

948
01:14:16,366 --> 01:14:19,726
Would I get to take
my bible to K-PAX?

949
01:14:19,992 --> 01:14:22,192
Of course you would.

950
01:14:22,413 --> 01:14:25,133
We can finish
the essays later.

951
01:14:32,923 --> 01:14:35,563
Now, I want you
to go back in time again,

952
01:14:35,802 --> 01:14:37,922
but not so far back
as last time.

953
01:14:40,556 --> 01:14:43,396
Is your friend there?

954
01:14:43,644 --> 01:14:46,564
Is he with you now?

955
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,496
Yeah.

956
01:14:49,692 --> 01:14:52,412
What's his name?
I'm not tellin'.

957
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:56,381
Prot, I would like to know
Your friend's name.

958
01:14:56,577 --> 01:14:58,897
Well, I ain't
gonna tell ya.

959
01:15:02,497 --> 01:15:05,497
Well, we have to
call him something.

960
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,670
How about Pete?

961
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:10,919
Well, that's not his name,
but whatever thrills you.

962
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:16,215
What year is it?
It's 1 985.

963
01:15:16,514 --> 01:15:19,594
How old are you?
One hundred
and seventy-five.

964
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,649
How old is Pete?
Seventeen.

965
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:25,100
Tell me about Pete.

966
01:15:27,234 --> 01:15:29,234
What happened?

967
01:15:29,403 --> 01:15:32,123
Is there a problem?

968
01:15:32,364 --> 01:15:34,924
Is that why
he called you?

969
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:38,039
He's got a girlfriend.

970
01:15:38,245 --> 01:15:40,685
And the problem
is with the girlfriend?
She's pregnant.

971
01:15:40,915 --> 01:15:43,355
He can see it all coming
right down the road.
You get married,

972
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:47,265
have a bunch of kids,
wind up in the same job
that killed your dad.

973
01:15:47,549 --> 01:15:49,789
He blames her for this?
Oh, no, no, no.

974
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:53,088
He doesn't blame her.
No, he just--

975
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:56,105
He--
How did he put it?

976
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:59,232
He hates the chains that people
shackle themselves with.

977
01:15:59,436 --> 01:16:01,556
I mean, we don't have
all that crap on K-PAX.

978
01:16:01,773 --> 01:16:05,653
All right, Prot.
I want you to listen
to me carefully.

979
01:16:06,947 --> 01:16:09,347
I want to move forward
in time again.

980
01:16:10,573 --> 01:16:12,373
Oh, say, two weeks.

981
01:16:14,286 --> 01:16:16,886
You--

982
01:16:17,124 --> 01:16:20,284
If you would like
to open your eyes
or move around, you may.

983
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:23,742
Would you like to?
I know that.

984
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,140
Prot?

985
01:16:34,309 --> 01:16:36,829
Prot, when--
It's, uh,

986
01:16:37,063 --> 01:16:39,423
1991,

987
01:16:39,648 --> 01:16:42,448
according to
Your Earth calendar.

988
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:44,730
And your friend Pete
called you?

989
01:16:44,945 --> 01:16:46,745
Not for anything
in particular.

990
01:16:46,948 --> 01:16:50,948
He just... sometimes
wants to talk things over...

991
01:16:52,744 --> 01:16:55,824
with someone
every now and then.

992
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,883
Tell me about Pete now.

993
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:01,325
He's a knocker.
A "knocker''?

994
01:17:01,588 --> 01:17:04,548
A knocker is the guy
that knocks the cow
inside of the head...

995
01:17:04,799 --> 01:17:07,839
so it won't struggle
while they slit its throat.

996
01:17:08,097 --> 01:17:11,417
I know.
It's barbaric, isn't it?

997
01:17:12,683 --> 01:17:14,763
Does he still live
in the same town?

998
01:17:14,979 --> 01:17:17,739
Oh, just outside of town.

999
01:17:17,982 --> 01:17:20,342
He's got a little place,
but he's fixed it up nice.

1000
01:17:20,526 --> 01:17:25,126
It's got some... trees
and a couple of acres...

1001
01:17:29,994 --> 01:17:31,794
and a river.

1002
01:17:36,669 --> 01:17:39,589
It reminds me of K-PAX,
except for the river.

1003
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,760
Tell me, did he ever marry
that pregnant girl?

1004
01:17:50,224 --> 01:17:52,104
Wow, what a memory.

1005
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:56,630
Yeah, they got married,
but she's no longer pregnant.
Why, that was six years ago.

1006
01:17:57,902 --> 01:18:00,142
I've forgotten her name.

1007
01:18:00,361 --> 01:18:02,161
S--

1008
01:18:04,825 --> 01:18:06,625
I didn't tell you
her name.

1009
01:18:06,828 --> 01:18:08,668
Can you tell me now?

1010
01:18:25,265 --> 01:18:27,305
Sara.

1011
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:37,949
Did they have
a son or a daughter?

1012
01:18:43,075 --> 01:18:44,875
Rebecca.

1013
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:52,675
Rebecca.

1014
01:18:58,135 --> 01:19:00,855
It's her birthday
next week.

1015
01:19:22,076 --> 01:19:24,876
Chak, what's happened?
Howie tried to kill Ernie.

1016
01:19:25,121 --> 01:19:27,481
What?
He's fine.

1017
01:19:29,421 --> 01:19:33,101
Ernie?
I feel wonderful,
Dr. Powell.

1018
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,340
For heaven's sake.
What happened?
Absolutely wonderful.

1019
01:19:36,928 --> 01:19:40,968
My good friend Howie,
he just about
strangled me to death.

1020
01:19:41,265 --> 01:19:44,065
What?

1021
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:46,110
Son of a bitch,
I love him.

1022
01:19:46,313 --> 01:19:48,153
Ernie, I don't understand.

1023
01:19:48,357 --> 01:19:50,597
You should've seen it.

1024
01:19:50,816 --> 01:19:54,336
I was asleep.
You know, the way I like--
my hands tied and everything.

1025
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:57,210
He wrapped something
around my neck--
a handkerchief or something--

1026
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:59,610
and then tightened it.

1027
01:19:59,825 --> 01:20:01,745
There wasn't a damn thing
I could do about it.

1028
01:20:01,952 --> 01:20:04,352
Well, when I
stopped breathing,

1029
01:20:04,584 --> 01:20:06,424
he lifted me onto the gurney,
rushed me up here,

1030
01:20:06,585 --> 01:20:09,225
and they brought me back
as quick as they could.

1031
01:20:09,464 --> 01:20:11,744
And when I woke up,

1032
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:16,339
You know what I realized,
Dr. Powell?

1033
01:20:18,724 --> 01:20:21,364
Dying.

1034
01:20:21,558 --> 01:20:24,678
Dying's something
You have no control over.

1035
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:29,139
Why waste your life
being afraid of it?

1036
01:20:29,402 --> 01:20:32,042
I'll sleep on my stomach
from now on.

1037
01:20:32,237 --> 01:20:34,077
I'll eat fish
with bones in it.

1038
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,760
I'll swallow the biggest
pill you can find.
Bring it on.

1039
01:20:36,992 --> 01:20:40,152
I feel good.

1040
01:20:44,377 --> 01:20:47,057
That's terrific, Ernie.

1041
01:20:49,384 --> 01:20:52,144
See you at our session
tomorrow?
Yes.

1042
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:57,060
I cured him, didn't I?

1043
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:02,993
Prot says one more task
and I'll be cured too.

1044
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:07,593
And then it's...
bon voyage.

1045
01:22:19,357 --> 01:22:21,477
Tell me your name, damn it.

1046
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:43,540
I'm gonna give you
a specific date,

1047
01:22:43,716 --> 01:22:47,036
and I want you to remember
where you were and what
You were doing on that day.

1048
01:22:47,304 --> 01:22:49,224
Do you understand?

1049
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:51,430
Perfectly well,
my dear sir.

1050
01:22:51,642 --> 01:22:56,522
The date
is July 27, 1 996.

1051
01:22:57,857 --> 01:22:59,657
I'm on K-PAX.

1052
01:22:59,861 --> 01:23:02,621
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure, governor.

1053
01:23:02,738 --> 01:23:03,978
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure, governor.

1054
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:06,078
I'm harvesting croppins
for a meal.

1055
01:23:06,242 --> 01:23:09,762
Croppins are a fungi,
like, uh, your truffles.

1056
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:12,199
Big truffles.
Delicious.
Do you like tru--

1057
01:23:17,046 --> 01:23:18,846
Wait a minute.

1058
01:23:20,924 --> 01:23:23,044
There it is.
What? Is it Pete?

1059
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:25,060
Yes.

1060
01:23:26,263 --> 01:23:29,063
I sense something is wrong.
He needs me.

1061
01:23:32,603 --> 01:23:34,763
I'm now on Earth.

1062
01:23:34,941 --> 01:23:36,781
I'm with him.

1063
01:23:36,944 --> 01:23:39,824
And where are you?
What are you doing?

1064
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:43,599
By a river...

1065
01:23:43,783 --> 01:23:47,223
in the back
of his house.

1066
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,295
It's dark.

1067
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,040
He's taking off
his clothes.

1068
01:23:53,252 --> 01:23:55,052
Why is he doing that?

1069
01:23:55,254 --> 01:23:57,614
He's--
What?

1070
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,080
What is he doing?

1071
01:24:02,469 --> 01:24:04,669
He's trying
to kill himself.

1072
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:08,900
Why does he want
to kill himself?

1073
01:24:14,818 --> 01:24:17,418
Because something terrible
has happened.

1074
01:24:17,655 --> 01:24:20,815
Has he done something?
Has he done something
he shouldn't have?

1075
01:24:21,034 --> 01:24:23,034
He doesn't want
to talk about it.

1076
01:24:23,243 --> 01:24:26,443
Prot, I'm trying to help him.
I can't help him unless he
tells me what happened.

1077
01:24:26,664 --> 01:24:28,784
He knows that.

1078
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:31,481
Well, then,
why won't he tell me?

1079
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:34,589
Because then
You would know...

1080
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:38,000
what even he
doesn't want to know.

1081
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:41,900
Then you have to
help him, Prot.

1082
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:44,219
You have to help him
tell me what happened.

1083
01:24:44,435 --> 01:24:47,595
He doesn't want
to talk about it.
Are you fucking deaf?

1084
01:24:47,856 --> 01:24:49,976
Time is running out
for him.

1085
01:24:50,191 --> 01:24:52,551
Time is running out
for everyone.

1086
01:24:54,027 --> 01:24:56,267
He jumps in.

1087
01:24:56,489 --> 01:24:58,289
He's floating.

1088
01:24:58,491 --> 01:25:00,371
Pulse is up to 1 40.
Respiration's at 30.

1089
01:25:00,536 --> 01:25:02,296
For God's sake, man,
bring him back.

1090
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,380
All right.
Listen to me.

1091
01:25:07,543 --> 01:25:09,943
Listen to me.

1092
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:12,251
You can save him.
You're his friend.

1093
01:25:12,463 --> 01:25:14,623
I am his friend.
That's why I won't try.

1094
01:25:14,841 --> 01:25:16,561
Save him!
No.

1095
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,559
I can't.

1096
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:21,441
The cur--
The current is too strong.

1097
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:24,043
There's no chance.

1098
01:25:24,269 --> 01:25:27,589
I... cannot.
Listen to me.

1099
01:25:27,858 --> 01:25:29,658
You've helped
a lot of patients here.

1100
01:25:29,861 --> 01:25:32,501
You've helped Mrs. Archer.
You've helped Howie and Ernie.

1101
01:25:32,736 --> 01:25:34,656
I'm gonna ask you
to help cure Pete now.

1102
01:25:36,826 --> 01:25:39,266
Let's call it a task.

1103
01:25:39,495 --> 01:25:41,935
- I want you
to let me speak to him.

1104
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:45,844
If he's listening,
I want him to know
that he can trust me.

1105
01:25:46,085 --> 01:25:50,045
I want him to know that if
it was Sara or Rebecca
that he did something--

1106
01:25:55,262 --> 01:25:57,502
Get in there.
No, no, no, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1107
01:25:57,724 --> 01:26:02,564
No. No, stay back.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1108
01:26:02,895 --> 01:26:06,815
Oh, my God!
Oh--

1109
01:26:07,109 --> 01:26:09,309
Oh, my God!

1110
01:26:09,529 --> 01:26:12,129
Oh, my God!

1111
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,965
It's okay.

1112
01:26:23,124 --> 01:26:24,964
It's all right.

1113
01:26:26,546 --> 01:26:28,746
Shh.

1114
01:26:28,966 --> 01:26:30,766
That's okay.

1115
01:26:30,971 --> 01:26:32,771
It's all right now.

1116
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:39,117
I'm gonna count backwards now
from five to one,

1117
01:26:39,395 --> 01:26:42,395
and as I count,
You'll become more
and more alert.

1118
01:26:42,647 --> 01:26:44,447
On the count of one
I'll snap my fingers,

1119
01:26:44,649 --> 01:26:47,169
and you'll wake up
feeling refreshed.

1120
01:26:47,362 --> 01:26:50,762
Five. You're starting
to come out of it.

1121
01:26:51,033 --> 01:26:53,713
Four. You're becoming
more alert.

1122
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,752
Three.
Even more alert.

1123
01:26:55,954 --> 01:26:57,794
Two. You're starting
to wake up now.

1124
01:26:57,998 --> 01:26:59,798
And one.

1125
01:27:08,803 --> 01:27:11,923
Are you okay?
Yes.

1126
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:14,060
Feeling fine.

1127
01:27:14,266 --> 01:27:16,066
Okay.

1128
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:08,283
Thank you.

1129
01:28:16,336 --> 01:28:20,136
Is this--
Is this area code 5-0-5?
Where arey ou?

1130
01:28:20,424 --> 01:28:22,864
New Mexico, sir.
New Mexico?

1131
01:28:26,596 --> 01:28:28,436
"Salva.''

1132
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,570
Salvation.

1133
01:28:35,564 --> 01:28:37,444
Salvation!

1134
01:28:37,608 --> 01:28:40,168
There are a dozen Salvation Army
shelters in New Mexico.

1135
01:28:40,403 --> 01:28:44,323
Albuquerque,
Las Cruces, Roswell.

1136
01:28:44,615 --> 01:28:50,015
Wait a minute.
There's one in Santa Rosa.
Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa.

1137
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:52,173
Santa Rosa.

1138
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,720
Guelph.

1139
01:28:56,922 --> 01:28:59,762
That's pretty damn close
to Santa Rosa.

1140
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:02,328
What's the biggest
local newspaper
for that region?

1141
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:07,170
Guadalupe County Observer,
covering Guadalupe County.

1142
01:29:07,433 --> 01:29:09,233
All right.
Bring that up.

1143
01:29:10,437 --> 01:29:14,197
Go toJuIy27, 1996.

1144
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:18,867
"'Swap meet, livestock sale. '"

1145
01:29:19,112 --> 01:29:20,952
Wait.
Go to the 28th.

1146
01:29:21,114 --> 01:29:22,634
Okay.

1147
01:29:22,823 --> 01:29:25,023
There it is!

1148
01:29:25,245 --> 01:29:28,165
"Robert Porter. Drowned!''

1149
01:29:29,417 --> 01:29:31,817
His name...

1150
01:29:32,045 --> 01:29:33,925
is Robert Porter.

1151
01:30:15,758 --> 01:30:18,678
Robert Porter.
Ah, here it is.

1152
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:21,770
Yeah, I do remember
this case.

1153
01:30:21,934 --> 01:30:24,494
It was about the biggest
thing ever happened
around these parts.

1154
01:30:26,102 --> 01:30:29,142
He was a quiet type.

1155
01:30:29,398 --> 01:30:32,758
As I recall, he was
a real smart fella.
Kind of brainy.

1156
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:35,507
Strong as a horse, though,
and worked as a knocker.

1157
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:39,460
Lived about 20 miles
outside of town with
his-his wife and child.

1158
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:43,621
Sarah.

1159
01:30:43,789 --> 01:30:45,629
His wife's name
was Sarah.

1160
01:30:45,791 --> 01:30:48,071
That's right.

1161
01:30:48,253 --> 01:30:50,453
Damn shame
what happened.

1162
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:53,850
You got time
to take a ride?

1163
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:56,690
Yeah.

1164
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,836
Well,
it's been empty.

1165
01:31:25,253 --> 01:31:27,293
Yeah, nobody comes around
here much anymore...

1166
01:31:27,505 --> 01:31:29,745
since all that happened.

1167
01:31:31,635 --> 01:31:34,955
Ain't no livin' next of kin
to give the place to anyway.

1168
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:47,509
I had detectives come
down from Albuquerque...

1169
01:31:47,695 --> 01:31:50,255
to try and piece
this one together.

1170
01:31:56,202 --> 01:31:58,922
Well, accordin' to
the official story,

1171
01:31:59,165 --> 01:32:01,845
Porter, he was at work
when this, uh, this drifter,

1172
01:32:02,044 --> 01:32:05,724
Darryl Walker,
come by the house.

1173
01:32:06,006 --> 01:32:09,766
Two-time parolee
lookin' for trouble.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1174
01:32:10,009 --> 01:32:11,849
Started out
as a robbery.

1175
01:32:12,013 --> 01:32:15,733
The wife and the daughter
were out back.

1176
01:32:16,015 --> 01:32:18,455
Sarah?

1177
01:32:18,685 --> 01:32:21,645
Sarah?

1178
01:32:21,858 --> 01:32:24,178
From what we can gather
from forensics and all,

1179
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:27,999
this Walker, he, uh--
he forced the two women
into the house.

1180
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:41,100
Raped the wife,

1181
01:32:41,337 --> 01:32:43,977
killed 'em both.

1182
01:32:49,262 --> 01:32:52,062
Porter, he must've come home
and found Walker still here.

1183
01:33:05,989 --> 01:33:07,949
God.

1184
01:33:08,158 --> 01:33:10,958
Snapped a grown man's neck
like it was a twig.

1185
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:11,413
Can't say I wouldn't have
done the same myself.

1186
01:35:33,945 --> 01:35:36,945
Uh, the river's
this way.

1187
01:36:10,276 --> 01:36:12,756
They found
the clothes there.

1188
01:36:14,823 --> 01:36:17,263
That's probably
where he jumped in.

1189
01:36:17,451 --> 01:36:19,931
And this river can be
pretty treacherous.

1190
01:36:20,161 --> 01:36:22,041
Even in July
it's got a hell of a current.

1191
01:36:22,247 --> 01:36:26,167
Still, I suppose it might
have been a mistake,
officially,

1192
01:36:26,459 --> 01:36:30,179
to declare it a drowning
when the body was never found.

1193
01:36:30,465 --> 01:36:31,825
Doc,

1194
01:36:31,967 --> 01:36:35,527
if that boy you got
back there in New York
is really Robert Porter,

1195
01:36:35,762 --> 01:36:38,362
I'd just as soon
not know about it.

1196
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,680
Know what I mean?

1197
01:37:49,678 --> 01:37:51,518
Mark.

1198
01:37:54,184 --> 01:37:55,984
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1199
01:37:56,184 --> 01:37:59,024
Never do that again.
I won't.

1200
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:01,230
What happened?

1201
01:38:01,441 --> 01:38:04,641
I found what
I was looking for.

1202
01:38:04,862 --> 01:38:08,022
You sure?
Yeah.

1203
01:38:09,616 --> 01:38:12,296
Wish I hadn't.

1204
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:23,707
{##And I think it's gonna be
a long, long time###

1205
01:38:23,967 --> 01:38:27,247
{## Till I touch down brings me
round again to find###

1206
01:38:27,511 --> 01:38:30,351
{##I'm not the man
they think I am at home###

1207
01:38:30,598 --> 01:38:33,158
{## Oh, no, no, no###

1208
01:38:33,393 --> 01:38:37,153
{##I'm a rocket man###

1209
01:38:37,438 --> 01:38:39,958
If you wouldn't mind
putting mine on top.

1210
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:42,670
{##Burnin' out his fuse
up here alone###

1211
01:38:48,327 --> 01:38:51,447
{##And I think it's gonna be
a long, long time######

1212
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:00,490
Prot.

1213
01:39:02,926 --> 01:39:04,766
Have a seat.

1214
01:39:07,137 --> 01:39:10,137
You all packed?
Ready to go?

1215
01:39:10,391 --> 01:39:13,711
Quite ready.
I travel light.

1216
01:39:13,937 --> 01:39:16,497
That's a joke,
Mark.

1217
01:39:16,732 --> 01:39:20,412
You humans.
There's just no
sense of humor.

1218
01:39:20,652 --> 01:39:24,292
I doubt, uh,
Freud ever tried this,

1219
01:39:24,534 --> 01:39:26,374
but before
someone goes away,

1220
01:39:26,534 --> 01:39:29,454
we usually like to send them off
with a little toast.

1221
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:33,784
Scotch okay, or would you prefer
something more fruity?

1222
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,576
I will try
the scotch.

1223
01:39:44,138 --> 01:39:45,978
Well,

1224
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:48,059
here's to a...

1225
01:39:48,267 --> 01:39:50,867
safe journey.

1226
01:40:12,545 --> 01:40:14,465
Tell you the truth,

1227
01:40:15,965 --> 01:40:18,605
K-PAX sounds like
a beautiful place.

1228
01:40:20,344 --> 01:40:23,824
I'd like to see it sometime.
Think there's a chance of that?

1229
01:40:25,183 --> 01:40:27,303
I think you should see
more of your world.

1230
01:40:27,517 --> 01:40:30,997
As a matter of fact,
I think you should see
more of your own family.

1231
01:40:32,357 --> 01:40:34,677
Invite your son
for Christmas.

1232
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:40,627
I may just do that, Prot.

1233
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:45,263
You know what I've learned
about your planet?

1234
01:40:45,498 --> 01:40:48,738
There's enough life on Earth
to fill 50 planets--

1235
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,880
plants, animals, people,
fungi, viruses--

1236
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:54,770
all jostling
to find their place,

1237
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:57,766
bouncing off each other,
feeding off each other,

1238
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,810
connected.

1239
01:41:02,766 --> 01:41:06,526
You don't have that kind
of connection on K-PAX?

1240
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:09,249
Nobody wants,
nobody needs.

1241
01:41:09,442 --> 01:41:11,682
On K-PAX, when I'm gone,
nobody misses me.

1242
01:41:11,903 --> 01:41:14,463
There would be
no reason to.

1243
01:41:14,698 --> 01:41:17,258
And yet I sense
that when I leave here,

1244
01:41:20,452 --> 01:41:22,292
I will be missed.

1245
01:41:23,998 --> 01:41:25,838
Yes.

1246
01:41:27,709 --> 01:41:29,629
Strange feeling.

1247
01:41:29,795 --> 01:41:32,195
You don't have
to leave, Prot.

1248
01:41:32,425 --> 01:41:36,145
I'm sure there must be some way
that I can help you...

1249
01:41:36,429 --> 01:41:40,309
to stay as one of us.

1250
01:41:47,398 --> 01:41:50,718
I will miss you,
Dr. Powell.

1251
01:42:01,706 --> 01:42:03,546
Oh.

1252
01:42:03,709 --> 01:42:06,029
And I have to finish
my report, but...

1253
01:42:08,755 --> 01:42:12,195
I seem to have misplaced
my pencil.

1254
01:42:24,859 --> 01:42:26,699
Take mine.

1255
01:42:34,910 --> 01:42:37,910
A much more efficient
writing tool.

1256
01:42:43,544 --> 01:42:45,384
Adios, my friend.

1257
01:42:48,674 --> 01:42:50,954
Prot?

1258
01:42:51,177 --> 01:42:53,457
I wanna show you
something.

1259
01:43:03,693 --> 01:43:05,853
That is Robert Porter.

1260
01:43:06,029 --> 01:43:08,109
Prot, that's you.

1261
01:43:08,321 --> 01:43:10,721
You and Robert Porter
are the same person.

1262
01:43:10,908 --> 01:43:14,668
That's patently absurd.
I'm not even human.

1263
01:43:14,913 --> 01:43:18,273
Can't you at least
admit the possibility?

1264
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:21,700
I will admit the possibility
that I am Robert Porter...

1265
01:43:22,922 --> 01:43:25,722
if you will admit
the possibility...

1266
01:43:25,924 --> 01:43:28,204
that I am from K-PAX.

1267
01:43:30,431 --> 01:43:33,671
Now if you'll excuse me,

1268
01:43:33,893 --> 01:43:36,373
I have a beam of light
to catch.

1269
01:43:39,064 --> 01:43:40,904
Oh, Mark.

1270
01:43:43,444 --> 01:43:46,284
Now that you've found Robert,

1271
01:43:46,532 --> 01:43:49,292
please take good care of him.

1272
01:43:58,585 --> 01:43:59,625
{## That nobody can deny###

1273
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:01,470
{## That nobody can deny###

1274
01:44:01,631 --> 01:44:04,351
# That nobody can deny #

1275
01:44:04,592 --> 01:44:07,232
# For he's a-- ##
I can't stand it.

1276
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:11,391
I-- I can't
stand this!

1277
01:44:11,642 --> 01:44:14,042
I demand to know...

1278
01:44:14,271 --> 01:44:17,191
which one of us
is goin' with you.

1279
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:21,241
Well, I can
tell you this.

1280
01:44:21,445 --> 01:44:25,685
There's extra points for
the one who goes to sleep first.

1281
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:31,700
Out of my way!

1282
01:44:31,956 --> 01:44:34,236
Oh, my gosh.

1283
01:44:38,379 --> 01:44:41,779
You never gave me
my last task.

1284
01:44:44,222 --> 01:44:46,982
What's my last task?

1285
01:44:54,357 --> 01:44:56,517
To stay here.

1286
01:44:59,194 --> 01:45:01,034
And be prepared...

1287
01:45:01,196 --> 01:45:03,756
for anything.

1288
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:05,530
You look tired, Doc.
Why don't you get
a few hours of rest?

1289
01:46:05,727 --> 01:46:08,607
He's not goin'
anywhere.
Uh--

1290
01:46:08,854 --> 01:46:10,974
We got seven hours.
I'll see you in four, hmm?

1291
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:13,270
Get some rest.

1292
01:46:26,418 --> 01:46:28,258
You're gonna eat.

1293
01:46:30,337 --> 01:46:32,777
You need some food
and you need to sleep.

1294
01:46:34,301 --> 01:46:36,141
Chow Fun.

1295
01:46:36,303 --> 01:46:39,263
Oh, the place on Broadway
with the ugly lanterns
in the window?

1296
01:46:39,514 --> 01:46:42,154
The mean walter
always shouted at us.

1297
01:46:42,393 --> 01:46:44,993
Their fortune cookies never
had any fortunes in 'em.

1298
01:46:48,317 --> 01:46:50,357
We never needed any.

1299
01:46:51,568 --> 01:46:54,048
I knew my fortune
that night.

1300
01:46:54,281 --> 01:46:57,441
He was sitting
right in front of me.

1301
01:46:57,659 --> 01:46:59,899
Hope he still is.

1302
01:47:18,475 --> 01:47:21,155
Hey.
What's up, man?

1303
01:47:21,351 --> 01:47:24,151
Look, 20 says
he goes.
You're on.

1304
01:48:01,937 --> 01:48:04,497
Shit!

1305
01:48:07,612 --> 01:48:09,452
Oh, damn it!

1306
01:48:14,662 --> 01:48:17,822
Two minutes.
You know where Dr. Powell is?

1307
01:48:18,041 --> 01:48:19,881
I'll buzz him.

1308
01:48:35,475 --> 01:48:37,195
One minute.

1309
01:48:43,651 --> 01:48:46,211
Here comes Dr. Powell!

1310
01:48:58,586 --> 01:49:00,066
He's moving.

1311
01:49:00,252 --> 01:49:02,092
Repeat:
He's moving!

1312
01:49:02,256 --> 01:49:04,096
What the hell?

1313
01:49:19,939 --> 01:49:22,339
Wait for me, you--

1314
01:49:39,963 --> 01:49:42,363
Son of a bitch.

1315
01:49:50,641 --> 01:49:52,481
Oh, God.

1316
01:49:56,023 --> 01:49:58,543
Oh, man.
Oh, God.

1317
01:49:58,777 --> 01:50:02,497
Call a code blue.
Help me.
Let's get him.

1318
01:50:17,923 --> 01:50:20,843
Who's that?
Beats me.
How'd he get in here?

1319
01:50:21,049 --> 01:50:24,769
That's not Prot.
He's definitely
not Prot.

1320
01:50:25,013 --> 01:50:28,013
Certainly not.
Prot's gone.

1321
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:33,400
Where's Bess?

1322
01:50:33,566 --> 01:50:36,686
Where's Bess? Bess?

1323
01:50:49,207 --> 01:50:51,567
He chose Bess.

1324
01:50:51,751 --> 01:50:53,591
Bitch!

1325
01:50:53,753 --> 01:50:56,113
Good-bye, Bess.

1326
01:50:57,925 --> 01:51:00,645
Good for you,
homegirl.

1327
01:51:19,075 --> 01:51:22,075
Bess went to K-PAX.

1328
01:51:44,603 --> 01:51:47,843
Patient 287, Robert Porter.

1329
01:51:49,442 --> 01:51:52,642
How I wish I could say that
Robert sat up one fine day...

1330
01:51:52,902 --> 01:51:55,542
and said, "'I'm hungry.
Got any fruit?'"

1331
01:51:57,616 --> 01:51:59,976
Like most catatonics,

1332
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:02,000
he probably hears
every word we say...

1333
01:52:02,162 --> 01:52:05,282
but refuses
or is unable to respond.

1334
01:52:06,876 --> 01:52:10,796
Nevertheless,
I keep him up to date.

1335
01:52:13,799 --> 01:52:15,839
Let's see.
I told you about Howie.

1336
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:18,330
He got that job
at the public library.

1337
01:52:19,767 --> 01:52:23,567
And Ernie, he's determined
to be a crisis counselor.

1338
01:52:23,812 --> 01:52:27,772
The only one we're, uh,
really concerned about is Bess.

1339
01:52:28,067 --> 01:52:30,507
You know, we've checked
halfway houses, shelters,

1340
01:52:30,694 --> 01:52:33,254
churches, bus stops.

1341
01:52:34,574 --> 01:52:37,014
Nothing.

1342
01:52:37,202 --> 01:52:39,682
Uh, we don't understand.
It's like...

1343
01:52:39,872 --> 01:52:42,712
people don't just disappear.

1344
01:52:46,545 --> 01:52:48,825
July 27th ?

1345
01:52:49,006 --> 01:52:52,086
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

1346
01:52:54,555 --> 01:52:56,395
Robert?

1347
01:53:01,269 --> 01:53:03,589
No.

1348
01:53:03,773 --> 01:53:06,053
Well, maybe
it'll come to you.

1349
01:53:08,613 --> 01:53:10,933
Whenever you're ready,
I'll be waiting.

1350
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:40,784
I want to tell you
something, Mark,

1351
01:53:41,022 --> 01:53:42,942
something you
do not yet know,

1352
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:46,389
but we K-PAXians have been
around long enough
to have discovered.

1353
01:53:48,031 --> 01:53:50,111
The universe will expand,

1354
01:53:50,324 --> 01:53:52,284
then it will collapse
back on itself,

1355
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:54,812
and then it will
expand again.

1356
01:53:55,037 --> 01:53:58,117
It will repeat
this process forever.

1357
01:53:58,333 --> 01:54:01,253
What you don't know is that
when the universe expands again,

1358
01:54:01,459 --> 01:54:04,539
everything will be
as it is now.

1359
01:54:04,757 --> 01:54:08,837
What ever mistakes you make
this time around, you will
live through on your next pass.

1360
01:54:09,096 --> 01:54:11,456
Every mistake you make...

1361
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:13,479
you will live through...

1362
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:17,481
again and again, forever.

1363
01:54:17,772 --> 01:54:21,372
So my advice to you is to
get it right this time around,

1364
01:54:21,608 --> 01:54:24,048
because this time...

1365
01:54:24,278 --> 01:54:26,518
is all you have.

1366
01:54:37,168 --> 01:54:40,768
You're lookin' great,
Michael.
Think so?

1367
01:54:41,005 --> 01:54:43,205
Thanks.
How you doin'?

1368
01:54:43,384 --> 01:54:45,584
Good. How was your--
How was your trip?

1369
01:54:45,803 --> 01:54:47,923
Was it--
Was it good?

1370
01:55:33,730 --> 01:55:36,970
{##Maybe this is forever###

1371
01:55:37,192 --> 01:55:39,352
{##Forever fades away###

1372
01:55:40,905 --> 01:55:43,065
{##Like a rocket ascending###

1373
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:46,600
{##Into space###

1374
01:55:48,163 --> 01:55:51,443
{## Could you not be sad###

1375
01:55:51,707 --> 01:55:54,627
{## Could you not breakdown###

1376
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,320
{##After all###

1377
01:55:57,550 --> 01:55:59,870
{##I won't let go###

1378
01:56:00,052 --> 01:56:05,332
{## Until you're safe and sound###

1379
01:56:07,308 --> 01:56:12,508
{## Until you're safe and sound###

1380
01:56:14,441 --> 01:56:17,721
{## There's beauty in release###

1381
01:56:17,945 --> 01:56:21,305
{## There's no one left
to please###

1382
01:56:21,573 --> 01:56:25,093
{##But you and me###

1383
01:56:38,261 --> 01:56:41,541
{##I don't blame you
