1
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800


2
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,336
I had the craziest dream last night.

3
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,686
I was dancing the White Swan.

4
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,650
It was different choreography, though. It was more like the Bolshoi's.

5
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,291
It was the prologue,

6
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:15,113
when Rothbart casts his spell.

7
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,538
Look how pink. So pretty...

8
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:30,337
Pretty!

9
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:34,397
- You're in a good mood. - He promised to feature me more this season.

10
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:36,610
Well, he certainly should.

11
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:38,539
You've been there long enough,

12
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:41,424
and you're the most dedicated dancer in the company.

13
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,791
Up.

14
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,660
- What's that? - What?

15
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:50,859
There.

16
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:55,305
Nothing.

17
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:01,227
You're sure you don't want me to come with you?

18
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:05,418
You're a sweet girl.

19
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:20,673
Did you see Beth today?

20
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,947
I can't believe she's back.

21
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,330
- Of course she's back. - What, she can't take a hint?

22
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:29,568
The company is broke. No one comes to see her anymore.

23
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:32,255
Oh, nobody actually comes to see ballet full stop.

24
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,672
That's not true. I heard The Royal had one of their best seasons yet.

25
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:37,623
He just needs to try something new. That's all.

26
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,325
No, someone new.

27
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:44,496
- Like who? - Like someone who's not approaching menopause.

28
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:45,964
It's sad.

29
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,631
What's sad?

30
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,865
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

31
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,436
Yeah, so is my grandmother.

32
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:59,979
- Well Fonteyn danced into her fifties. - Yeah, we know.

33
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:07,405
Great.

34
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,932
Thought I'd fucking missed my stop.

35
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:12,387
It's a hell-fit all the way from 79th.

36
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,686
Beautiful as always, Nina.

37
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,953
Relax.

38
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:15,570
And one, and two, and three, and four.

39
00:08:22,864 --> 00:08:24,094
Stop, John. One second.

40
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:36,881
Okay, take position.

41
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,867
And one, and two, and three, and up.

42
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:44,326
And one, and two, and three, and four.

43
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,631
Hello, dear.

44
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,305
We all know the story.

45
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,050
Virginal girl, pure and sweet,

46
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:12,720
trapped in the body of a swan.

47
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:16,228
She desires freedom

48
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:19,201
that only true love can break the spell.

49
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:27,544
Her wish is nearly granted in the form of a Prince.

50
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:31,748
But before he can declare his love,

51
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:37,863
The lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him.

52
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:47,742
Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff,

53
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:52,706
killing herself. And in death...

54
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:55,533
finds freedom.

55
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:04,119
- Good morning, company. - Good morning.

56
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:08,407
We will open our season with <i>Swan Lake</i>.

57
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,636
Done to death, I know.

58
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:12,236
But not like this.

59
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:17,134
We strip it down, make it visceral and real.

60
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:22,025
A new production needs a new Swan Queen.

61
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,774
A fresh face to present to the world.

62
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,009
But... Which of you can embody both Swans?

63
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:36,377
The White, and the Black.

64
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:45,399
All the soloists I tapped:

65
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:48,503
Go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon.

66
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,118
And the girls I didn't tap:

67
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:57,428
Meet me in the principals' studio at 5:00.

68
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:58,904
Thank you.

69
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:04,193
All right.

70
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,898
- Let's go. Did we do left side? - Yes, mistress.

71
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:45,012
Fuck! Fuck!

72
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:51,716
What?

73
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:35,424
If I was only casting the White Swan, she'd be yours.

74
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:38,446
But I'm not.

75
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:41,222
Maestro, Odile's coda, please.

76
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:42,999
Now show me your Black Swan, Nina.

77
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,627
Not so controlled. Seduce us.

78
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:12,932
Not just the Prince, but the court, the audience, the entire world.

79
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:16,123
Come on, like a spider spinning a web.

80
00:14:16,158 --> 00:14:18,614
Attack it, attack it! Come on!

81
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:30,720
Well...

82
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:33,045
- Good of you to join us. - Sorry...

83
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,930
Girls, this is Lily.

84
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:38,539
Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

85
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:40,232
- Hey. - Get warmed up.

86
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:41,116
No, it's okay.

87
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,323
I'm good.

88
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:45,685
Should I go again?

89
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:48,604
No, thanks, Nina. I've seen enough.

90
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,201
Veronica, the White Swan variation.

91
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:59,090
Come on, come on, come on, please.

92
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,016
All right, Maestro.

93
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:04,750
Two, three...

94
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:12,005
So how'd it go?

95
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,000
You were late, so I called Susie in the office.

96
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:19,178
An audition! I can't believe he just sprang that on you.

97
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,386
So?

98
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,213
It was fine.

99
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,195
Just fine?

100
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,837
Oh, sweetheart...

101
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,669
You tell me about it.

102
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:28,118
Nina, everything all right?

103
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:29,159
I'm fine.

104
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:44,780
Almost done.

105
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,987
You're working yourself too hard.

106
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:52,592
- We all have off days. - That girl, um, barged in.

107
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:54,465
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

108
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:02,710
For a starter, if I hadn't taken you to each of your classes, you'd have been completely lost.

109
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:05,219
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow. I'm going to tell him I finished it.

110
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:06,680
You don't need to lie.

111
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,450
You won't convince him one way or the other.

112
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:14,334
Oh, sweetheart.

113
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:18,032
I know it's disappointing.

114
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,710
When you start getting older, there's all this

115
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:25,477
ridiculous pressure. God knows I understand.

116
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:28,594
But it's all right.

117
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:31,515
No matter what.

118
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:36,223
You'll probably get to dance the part of the cat again.

119
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,605
That's such a wonderful part.

120
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,350
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

121
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:46,318
Either way, you'll shine.

122
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:48,988
You know...

123
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,803
Everything will be better in the morning.

124
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:56,097
It always is.

125
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:00,508
Sweet girl.

126
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:27,468
Yes, Nina?

127
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:28,783
Do you have a minute?

128
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,783
- Now's not a good time. I get it. - Now is perfect.

129
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,714
I just wanted to tell you that

130
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,637
I practiced the coda last night and

131
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,520
I finished.

132
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:54,848
I thought you should know.

133
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:58,693
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly, I don't care about your technique.

134
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:01,679
- You should know that by now. - Yeah, but yesterday...

135
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:02,849
No. Anyway...

136
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:05,297
I've already chosen Veronica. Sorry.

137
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:08,066
Sorry.

138
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,148
Okay, thank you.

139
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,053
That's it?

140
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,574
You're not going to try and change my mind?

141
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:19,976
You must have thought it was possible.

142
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:23,270
Otherwise, what are you doing here all dolled up?

143
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,470
I came to ask for the part.

144
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:35,905
The truth is...

145
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,842
When I look at you, all I see is the White Swan.

146
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:44,081
Yes, you're beautiful, fearful, fragile.

147
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:45,899
Ideal casting.

148
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:51,258
But the Black Swan? It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

149
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:53,952
I can dance the Black Swan, too.

150
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,090
Really?

151
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,181
In four years, every time you dance,

152
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:03,064
I see obsess getting each and every move perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself.

153
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,186
Ever. All that discipline for what?

154
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,623
- I just want to be perfect. - You what?

155
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,439
I want to be perfect.

156
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,591
Perfection is not just about control.

157
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:24,216
It's also about letting go.

158
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:28,881
Surprise yourself so you can surprise the audience. Transcendence.

159
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,128
And very few have it in them.

160
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:33,744
I think I do have it in me.

161
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:42,582
You bit me?

162
00:21:42,617 --> 00:21:45,684
I can't believe you bit me!

163
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,290
I'm sorry.

164
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:49,501
Man, that fucking hurt!

165
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:07,115
What?

166
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,324
Why's she always staring at me?

167
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:13,685
Hey, it's been posted.

168
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,279
Hey, it's up!

169
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:23,031
Veronica.

170
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,070
Congratulations.

171
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:44,771
Why would you say that?

172
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:47,976
Your idea of some sick joke?

173
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:49,376
What?

174
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:51,843
Fuck you.

175
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:06,811
Hey, Nina!

176
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:08,279
Congratulations!

177
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,051
Congratulations.

178
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,515
You're so beautiful.

179
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,501
Congratulations.

180
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:39,052
<i>- Hello?</i> - Hi.

181
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:41,030
<i>What is it? What's wrong?</i>

182
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,636
I'm fine.

183
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:46,177
He picked me, Mom.

184
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,510
Do you hear me?

185
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:53,398
<i>- For Swan Lake?</i> - I'm going to be Swan Queen!

186
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:56,859
Mom!

187
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,326
I'll be home soon. I just wanted to let you know.

188
00:24:00,383 --> 00:24:01,428
<i>- I love you.</i> - I love you, too.

189
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:37,292
Mom?

190
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:42,030
Mom, are you in your room?

191
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,661
Nina?

192
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:18,132
Are you home?

193
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:32,424
Nina, when you get out I'm in the kitchen.

194
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:35,868
Come on, sweetie.

195
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,600
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

196
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:50,575
It's our favorite. Vanilla with strawberry filling.

197
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,169
Oh, Mom, not too big.

198
00:25:52,204 --> 00:25:54,144
Oh, that's way, way too much.

199
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,266
- It's a celebration. It's just this once. - Mom...

200
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,766
My stomach's still in knots.

201
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:02,241
Fine.

202
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:04,102
Fine.

203
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:05,385
Then it's garbage!

204
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,637
No, Mom, don't. I'm sorry.

205
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:19,109
I'm just... I'm just so proud of you.

206
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,879
It looks so yummy.

207
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:35,257
Okay, okay.

208
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:36,762
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:38,848
Thank you, Nina.

210
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:40,634
That's very nice.

211
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:42,817
Very nice.

212
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,624
But I knew the White Swan wouldn't be a problem.

213
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:51,354
The real work will your metamorphosis into her evil twin.

214
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:55,130
And I know I saw a flash of her yesterday.

215
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:58,440
So get ready to give me more of that bite.

216
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:21,762
Excellent.

217
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:27,788
That evil force is pulling you that you can't escape. That's just out of your control.

218
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:33,444
So you sense it, you get aware of it more: "It's taking me, it's taking me."

219
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,144
A little bit more desperate.

220
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:40,921
Right, and you can maybe go up a little bit and then come down, and then...

221
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:42,219
That's it.

222
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,569
Watch the way she moves.

223
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:23,909
Imprecise, but effortless.

224
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,414
She's not faking it.

225
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:36,535
Gorgeous! Okay, that's beautiful.

226
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,415
Let's start again from the beginning.

227
00:29:47,658 --> 00:29:50,333
You'll room with Beth from now on, so be considerate.

228
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:51,702
Thanks, Susie.

229
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:54,156
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

230
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:56,136
They're beautiful.

231
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:15,439
I'll be back in a second.

232
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:19,795
Let me come back to you, please.

233
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:24,144
Let's go.

234
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:31,397
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

235
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:35,058
We need our cash, so please don't forget to smile.

236
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:39,416
Ladies and gentlemen, please, may I have your attention?

237
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:41,969
Good evening.

238
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:44,849
Let me make this very important announcement.

239
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:51,114
You all had had the chance and the privilege to be enchanted, transported,

240
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,914
and even sometimes devastated, by the performances

241
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:55,948
of this true artist of our company.

242
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:58,968
She's been a crucial inspiration to my work.

243
00:30:59,003 --> 00:31:02,786
A role model to all dancers, and even more than that,

244
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:05,808
a deeply appreciated presence on our stage.

245
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:07,935
You all know who I am talking about.

246
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,278
Ladies and gentlemen, Beth Macintyre.

247
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:17,723
But as we all know,

248
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:20,137
every great career has to come to an end.

249
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:25,026
Beth is retiring at the end of season.

250
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,363
She will be giving her farewell performance as Melpomene,

251
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:31,921
the role she originated in my first ballet.

252
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:35,977
My little princess,

253
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:39,281
we honor you. You will be greatly missed,

254
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:42,373
and never forgotten.

255
00:31:42,408 --> 00:31:46,470
But as we bid <i>adieu</i> to one star, we welcome another.

256
00:31:47,502 --> 00:31:50,492
We're opening our season with my new version of <i>Swan Lake</i>.

257
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:55,500
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen, the exquisite Nina Sayers.

258
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:03,875
You'll soon have the pleasure of seeing her perform,

259
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:11,369
but right now, let's please raise a glass: To all of us. To Beth. To Nina.

260
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:14,487
To beauty.

261
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:33,324
Just a second.

262
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,525
Just a second!

263
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,675
Come on! I'm about to burst!

264
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:14,993
Hey, it's you!

265
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:17,604
I don't think we ever officially met.

266
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:20,291
- I'm Lily. - Hi, I'm Nina.

267
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:22,511
Yes, our new Swan Queen.

268
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,109
- Here, hold this. - Yeah, sure.

269
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:29,219
You must be so excited.

270
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,668
Are you freaking out?

271
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:33,740
- Yeah... - Yeah?

272
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:36,814
Oh, it's okay.

273
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,681
Oh, I'd be losing my mind.

274
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,940
I should get back...

275
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:42,679
No, no, no, come on, stay.

276
00:33:42,714 --> 00:33:44,505
Keep me company.

277
00:33:48,214 --> 00:33:49,003
Excuse me.

278
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:52,390
Oh, there you are. Come on.

279
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,074
Hey. They tried to eat you alive, but here you are.

280
00:34:02,662 --> 00:34:03,386
You did well.

281
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:04,790
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

282
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:06,879
Where are you going?

283
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:09,233
Upper west side.

284
00:34:09,268 --> 00:34:11,041
Stop at my place for a drink. It's on the way.

285
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:14,838
Thomas, you need to say hello to Karen Holloway.

286
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:19,280
A minute more of ass-kissing. I'll be back. Wait for me here, all right?

287
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:23,315
Hello, Karen!

288
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:06,489
Beth!

289
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:10,420
I'm so sorry to hear you're leaving the company.

290
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,279
What did you do to get this role?

291
00:35:17,622 --> 00:35:20,314
He always said you were such a frigid little girl.

292
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:24,464
What did you do to make him change his mind?

293
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:28,623
Did you suck his cock?

294
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,389
Not all of us have to.

295
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:34,567
You fucking whore!

296
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:37,969
You're a fucking little whore!

297
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:39,415
Whoa, what's going on here?

298
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,580
Hey, I need to talk to you.

299
00:35:42,615 --> 00:35:44,748
- You're drunk. You should go home. - I need to talk to you.

300
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:48,466
No! Don't you do that! Don't you dismiss me like that!

301
00:35:50,988 --> 00:35:53,648
My little princess, please. Pull it together.

302
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:57,057
- Come. - I'm coming by later.

303
00:35:57,092 --> 00:36:01,768
I have something for you. It's a token of my appreciation.

304
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:04,530
- Right. - You make the most of it, Nina.

305
00:36:05,773 --> 00:36:07,092
Don't worry. It's typical.

306
00:36:13,036 --> 00:36:15,893
Please. I thought it'd be good to talk about the role.

307
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:17,234
Drown this a little.

308
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:19,518
I don't want there to be any boundaries between us.

309
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,601
- No, me neither. - Good.

310
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:26,003
So... You got a boyfriend?

311
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,245
No.

312
00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:32,127
Have you had many in the past?

313
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:34,198
A few.

314
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,883
But no one serious.

315
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:41,744
You're not a virgin are you?

316
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:45,946
No.

317
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:48,193
So there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

318
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,439
And you enjoy making love?

319
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:57,793
Excuse me?

320
00:36:57,828 --> 00:36:59,979
Come on, sex.

321
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:01,411
Do you enjoy it?

322
00:37:04,406 --> 00:37:06,268
We need to be able to talk about this.

323
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,071
I've got a little homework assignment for you.

324
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:20,563
Go home and touch yourself.

325
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:23,677
Live a little.

326
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:30,539
Well it's late. Lots of work tomorrow.

327
00:37:30,574 --> 00:37:33,470
The doorman will find a cab for you.

328
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:40,845
Sounds like quite an evening. I wish I could have been there.

329
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,415
You know I asked.

330
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,221
I know you did. Susie told me.

331
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:47,130
Guess he wanted you all to himself.

332
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,286
But why?

333
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:50,710
Don't blame him.

334
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,173
Where'd you get these?

335
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,032
They're fake.

336
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,852
Fooled me.

337
00:38:06,306 --> 00:38:07,141
I can do it.

338
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,349
He must have been by your side all night.

339
00:38:14,384 --> 00:38:17,855
Showing you off.

340
00:38:20,107 --> 00:38:21,845
- Oh, Nina... - It's just a rash.

341
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,043
Rash? What are you talking about?

342
00:38:24,078 --> 00:38:25,655
It was worse a few days ago. It's fine already.

343
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,818
- You've been scratching yourself again. - No I haven't.

344
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:29,771
Mom!

345
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:31,247
This disgusting habit...

346
00:38:32,915 --> 00:38:34,697
Jesus Christ, I thought you were done with this, Nina.

347
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,440
Shrugs. You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

348
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:38,828
Sit down. You have the white one,

349
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:40,888
and the pink one. And that'll hide it.

350
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:45,625
And then I'll dig out that expensive coverup. We still have some.

351
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,099
No one will see it.

352
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,741
Mom, please,

353
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:54,007
It's the role, isn't it? It's all this pressure.

354
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,914
I knew it'd be too much. I knew it.

355
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,686
You're all right.

356
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,056
You'll be all right.

357
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:09,312
Beth's in the hospital.

358
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:12,371
She had an accident.

359
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:14,073
Oh no!

360
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:14,547
Beth?

361
00:41:22,456 --> 00:41:23,058
What happened?

362
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:27,397
She walked into the street and got hit by a car.

363
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:30,644
You know what?

364
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:34,395
I'm almost sure she did it on purpose.

365
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:36,918
How do you know?

366
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:41,937
Because everything Beth does comes from within, from some dark impulse.

367
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:45,850
I guess that's what makes her so thrilling to watch.

368
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:48,472
So dangerous.

369
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:51,904
Even perfect at times.

370
00:41:55,373 --> 00:41:57,222
But also so damned destructive.

371
00:41:59,548 --> 00:42:01,356
Was it right after we saw her?

372
00:42:01,391 --> 00:42:05,270
Wait, wait, wait. This has nothing to do with you.

373
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:08,416
It's not your problem, so don't let yourself be distracted.

374
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:11,643
This is your moment, Nina.

375
00:42:11,878 --> 00:42:14,225
Don't let it go.

376
00:43:44,216 --> 00:43:44,858
What are you doing?

377
00:45:26,748 --> 00:45:27,335
Nina?

378
00:45:29,432 --> 00:45:31,092
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

379
00:45:41,443 --> 00:45:44,668
And... Come on!

380
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:47,197
Forget about control, Nina. I want to see passion.

381
00:45:47,232 --> 00:45:48,940
Come on.

382
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,990


383
00:45:52,237 --> 00:45:55,066
Stiff like a dead corpse. Let it go.

384
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:57,363
Let it go. Let it go.

385
00:45:57,398 --> 00:45:59,807
And again.

386
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:02,819
Feels like you have your diaphragm

387
00:46:02,854 --> 00:46:05,571
is in a bit of a contraction?

388
00:46:05,606 --> 00:46:06,729
I'm okay.

389
00:46:11,183 --> 00:46:14,428
Breathe in to this hand. Breathe in to this hand.

390
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:16,528
Breathe in, all the way. Good.

391
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:19,237
And exhale.

392
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,969
Does it feel jammed in the front every time you <i>plie</i>?

393
00:46:25,004 --> 00:46:26,773
Sometimes, not always.

394
00:46:30,814 --> 00:46:31,725
- One more pull, okay? - Okay.

395
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:38,201
- Is that okay? - Yeah.

396
00:46:58,973 --> 00:47:00,885
David, can I ask you a question?

397
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,132
Honestly, would you fuck that girl?

398
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:07,009
No.

399
00:47:07,044 --> 00:47:08,571
No one would.

400
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:10,757
Nina...

401
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:13,978
Your dancing is just as frigid...

402
00:47:14,013 --> 00:47:16,396
Fuck!

403
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:23,359
We're still working here, please. Lights!

404
00:47:23,394 --> 00:47:24,808
The lights!

405
00:47:26,285 --> 00:47:26,912
Thank you!

406
00:47:26,947 --> 00:47:30,547
Okay, guys, you can go. Thanks for your patience.

407
00:47:32,303 --> 00:47:33,480
No, no, you stay. You stay.

408
00:47:36,091 --> 00:47:37,076
Have fun, you two.

409
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:41,440
Okay.

410
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:42,750
Come here.

411
00:47:42,785 --> 00:47:43,792
Come, come, come, come.

412
00:47:46,926 --> 00:47:47,823
I'll be the Prince.

413
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:09,915
Let it go. Let it go.

414
00:48:31,763 --> 00:48:32,607
Feel my touch.

415
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:33,782
Respond to it.

416
00:48:33,817 --> 00:48:35,070
Come on.

417
00:48:48,237 --> 00:48:50,562
Open your mouth. Open it. Open up.

418
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:18,505
That was me seducing you,

419
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,231
when it needs to be the other way around.

420
00:49:21,266 --> 00:49:22,378
Please...

421
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,279
Who is that?

422
00:49:48,391 --> 00:49:48,844
Hey.

423
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,302
You okay?

424
00:49:54,755 --> 00:49:55,973
You can't smoke in here.

425
00:49:56,008 --> 00:49:59,593
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

426
00:50:03,115 --> 00:50:03,971
So...

427
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:06,841
The big day's getting closer and closer, huh?

428
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:12,386
Well, I can't wait. I think you're going to be amazing.

429
00:50:14,534 --> 00:50:14,892
Thanks.

430
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:31,137
So...

431
00:50:31,172 --> 00:50:33,779
Do  you want to talk about it?

432
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,586
It's that hard to.

433
00:50:39,972 --> 00:50:41,878
Leroy playing a little too rough for you?

434
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,620
Come on, Nina. He's a prick.

435
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:46,684
He's brilliant.

436
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,103
Sure, but it's not like he's all warm and fuzzy.

437
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,045
What you don't know is...

438
00:50:56,164 --> 00:50:58,166
Someone's hot for teacher!

439
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,287
Oh, come on, it's okay. I don't blame you.

440
00:51:02,322 --> 00:51:03,710
I should go home.

441
00:51:03,745 --> 00:51:06,462
Nina, come on. I'm just playing around.

442
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:09,046
Nina!

443
00:52:29,911 --> 00:52:33,175
Sweetie? What are you doing in there?

444
00:53:01,408 --> 00:53:01,951
Again.

445
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,258
Again.

446
00:53:48,116 --> 00:53:49,831
Do you have any corrections?

447
00:53:54,942 --> 00:53:56,994
Lily told me that she saw you crying.

448
00:53:58,955 --> 00:54:00,494
That you were very upset

449
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:02,432
and that I should take it easy on you.

450
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:03,985
I didn't tell her that.

451
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,422
Maybe you need a little break.

452
00:54:06,457 --> 00:54:09,327
A day or two. Or maybe a month. What do you think?

453
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:10,543
She shouldn't have said anything.

454
00:54:10,578 --> 00:54:12,702
No, you shouldn't be whining in the first place.

455
00:54:12,737 --> 00:54:13,486
I didn't.

456
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,333
You could be brilliant.

457
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:20,271
But you're a coward.

458
00:54:20,306 --> 00:54:22,608
Sorry.

459
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:25,105
No, stop saying that! That's exactly what I'm talking about.

460
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,657
Stop being so fucking weak.

461
00:54:26,692 --> 00:54:28,087
Again!

462
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:41,946
Lily...

463
00:54:41,981 --> 00:54:45,060
Oh, look who's decided to grace us with her presence.

464
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:46,023
I need to talk to you.

465
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:46,974
Okay.

466
00:54:47,009 --> 00:54:48,468
Now.

467
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:50,334
Shut up.

468
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:51,585
Come on.

469
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,163
What's up?

470
00:54:56,198 --> 00:54:58,810
You told Thomas about last night?

471
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:03,402
Oh, yeah. I ran into him in the morning and he said you guys were having some trouble.

472
00:55:03,437 --> 00:55:04,527
Why would he talk to you?

473
00:55:04,562 --> 00:55:07,222
Oh, excuse me, your highness.

474
00:55:07,257 --> 00:55:11,112
I just told him you're working your ass off and I think you'll be great.

475
00:55:11,147 --> 00:55:12,046
Well you shouldn't have.

476
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:16,921
Okay.

477
00:55:50,072 --> 00:55:51,355
Has he tried anything with you?

478
00:55:55,884 --> 00:55:57,535
He has a reputation.

479
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,704
I have a right to be concerned, Nina. You've been staying late so many nights.

480
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:08,863
Rehearsing. I just hope he isn't taking advantage, that's all.

481
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:10,303
He's not.

482
00:56:10,338 --> 00:56:11,953
Good.

483
00:56:14,796 --> 00:56:16,609
I just don't want you to make the same mistake I did.

484
00:56:18,339 --> 00:56:18,735
Thanks.

485
00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:20,942
Not like that.

486
00:56:22,265 --> 00:56:24,305
I just mean as far as my career was concerned.

487
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,244
What career?

488
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:30,957
The one I gave up to have you.

489
00:56:33,272 --> 00:56:34,311
I'm twenty-eight.

490
00:56:34,346 --> 00:56:35,737
So?

491
00:56:36,415 --> 00:56:37,601
Only that...

492
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,660
Only what?

493
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:42,324
Nothing.

494
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:43,593
- What? - Nothing.

495
00:56:47,348 --> 00:56:48,321
How is your skin?

496
00:56:48,356 --> 00:56:50,434
Fine.

497
00:56:50,469 --> 00:56:52,115
- Are you leaving it alone? - Mm-hmm.

498
00:56:55,347 --> 00:56:55,907
Let me see.

499
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:02,405
- Take off your shirt. - No.

500
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:16,100
Can I help you?

501
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:21,460
Who was that?

502
00:57:21,495 --> 00:57:23,044
It was no one.

503
00:57:25,215 --> 00:57:25,825
It was no one.

504
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:31,639
Hello?

505
00:57:36,448 --> 00:57:37,157
What are you doing here?

506
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:39,145
I just came by to apologize.

507
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,379
You're right. I should have never spoken to him about you.

508
00:57:41,414 --> 00:57:43,592
- Sweetheart. - Give me a second.

509
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,287
- Your dinner... - Mom, please.

510
00:57:47,575 --> 00:57:48,851
Oh, she's a trip.

511
00:57:48,867 --> 00:57:50,253
How do you know where I live?

512
00:57:51,696 --> 00:57:52,783
I have my ways.

513
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:57,201
Jesus, relax. I got it from Susie in the office.

514
00:57:58,524 --> 00:58:01,779
Look, I feel really shitty about what I did, and I really want to make it up to you.

515
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:04,057
So how about I take you out to dinner?

516
00:58:05,102 --> 00:58:07,586
- I don't think... - Okay, that's fine.

517
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,841
What about drinks?

518
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:11,516
Sweetie, you need to rest.

519
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:13,752
- Jesus. - Wait.

520
00:58:15,598 --> 00:58:16,429
What are you doing?

521
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:18,602
I'm going out.

522
00:58:18,637 --> 00:58:20,176
What? Nina!

523
00:58:20,211 --> 00:58:22,880
You're on the stage tomorrow.

524
00:58:24,615 --> 00:58:26,104
I can't believe he calls her that.

525
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:28,728
- It's so gross. - I think it's sweet.

526
00:58:28,763 --> 00:58:30,582
Little Princess?

527
00:58:30,617 --> 00:58:33,056
- He probably calls every girl that. - No way.

528
00:58:33,091 --> 00:58:35,073
That's just for Beth.

529
00:58:35,108 --> 00:58:39,719
Well, I bet he'll be calling you Little Princess any day now.

530
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:41,269
I don't know about that.

531
00:58:41,304 --> 00:58:44,537
Oh, sure he will. Just got to let him lick your pussy.

532
00:58:46,198 --> 00:58:48,338
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

533
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:50,180
Mmm, <i>dankeschin</i>.

534
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:53,475
Let me know if that's juicy enough for you.

535
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,318
Oh, I will.

536
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,076
You have enough cheese?

537
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:01,489
No, but you do.

538
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:04,881
Enjoy.

539
00:59:14,765 --> 00:59:15,428
All right.

540
00:59:22,316 --> 00:59:23,628
Wanna spruce up?

541
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:26,771
What, I carry a spare

542
00:59:26,806 --> 00:59:30,035
in case I wake up somewhere unexpected.

543
00:59:34,048 --> 00:59:35,452
So how is he?

544
00:59:38,137 --> 00:59:39,226
Thomas.

545
00:59:41,095 --> 00:59:42,221
I wouldn't know.

546
00:59:42,256 --> 00:59:45,640
- Oh, come on. - I really don't want to talk about that.

547
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:48,532
Okay.

548
00:59:50,374 --> 00:59:53,290
You really need to relax.

549
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,773
One for you,

550
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:03,770
one for me.

551
01:00:05,112 --> 01:00:08,980
Oh, and don't worry. It's pure, I promise. I brought it with me straight from San Francisco.

552
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,381
What is it?

553
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:14,470
Are you kidding?

554
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:17,705
You've never rolled?

555
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:23,290
Oh, relax. Here. It'll loosen you up.

556
01:00:25,169 --> 01:00:27,286
Wait till you see the night sky.

557
01:00:31,217 --> 01:00:32,468
How long does it last?

558
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,990
A couple hours, tops.

559
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:41,242
It's okay.

560
01:00:41,277 --> 01:00:43,904
Okay.

561
01:01:46,126 --> 01:01:47,383
Nina, hi!

562
01:01:47,418 --> 01:01:53,941
I thought we could use some company. So this is Tom and this is Jerry.

563
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:57,638
- Actually it's Andrew. - Tom.

564
01:01:57,673 --> 01:02:01,336
- I have to go... - Oh, no you can't go. I just got us some drinks.

565
01:02:02,547 --> 01:02:03,659
I shouldn't...

566
01:02:03,694 --> 01:02:05,474
We're on the stage tomorrow.

567
01:02:05,509 --> 01:02:07,603
So what are you going to do? Go home to Mommy?

568
01:02:11,754 --> 01:02:12,974
Come on, live a little.

569
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:19,034
It's just a couple hours, right?

570
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:21,478
Tops.

571
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:26,418
Cheers.

572
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,005
You haven't told me who you are.

573
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:32,389
I'm a dancer.

574
01:02:32,424 --> 01:02:33,970
No, I mean your name.

575
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:36,986
- Oh. Nina. - So are you two sisters?

576
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:37,937
- Yes. - No.

577
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:42,280
- Blood sisters. - We dance in the same company.

578
01:02:42,315 --> 01:02:46,026
Ah, ballerinas. No wonder you two look alike.

579
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:49,018
I see now. Tom and Jerry here are gay lovers.

580
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:51,008
- Very funny. - I like to amuse myself.

581
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:52,494
I've never been to the ballet.

582
01:02:52,529 --> 01:02:55,438
Then you are definitely not gay.

583
01:02:55,473 --> 01:02:57,382
I mean, it's kind of boring, isn't it?

584
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:58,534
- Be honest. - No it's not.

585
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:01,571
You know what? It's just not for everyone.

586
01:03:01,606 --> 01:03:04,484
You should come sometime. I can comp you tickets whenever you want.

587
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:05,928
Yeah. Yeah.

588
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:08,479
- Yeah, that would be neat. Thanks. - Okay well...

589
01:03:08,514 --> 01:03:10,464
I think it's time for another round.

590
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:13,961
Bottoms up.

591
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,958
So what are you guys working on now?

592
01:03:21,724 --> 01:03:24,090
Sorry.

593
01:03:26,027 --> 01:03:27,919
<i>Swan Lake</i>.

594
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:29,216
Yeah?

595
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:30,903
You know it?

596
01:03:30,922 --> 01:03:32,800
No, not really.

597
01:03:32,812 --> 01:03:33,842
Heard of it.

598
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:35,272
What's it about?

599
01:03:36,621 --> 01:03:38,874
It's about a girl who gets turned into a swan,

600
01:03:38,909 --> 01:03:41,480
and she needs love to break the spell.

601
01:03:43,807 --> 01:03:46,167
But her prince falls for the wrong girl,

602
01:03:48,948 --> 01:03:50,207
and so she kills herself.

603
01:03:50,242 --> 01:03:53,444
It's not a happy ending then.

604
01:03:53,479 --> 01:03:56,615
It's beautiful, actually.

605
01:03:59,908 --> 01:04:00,862
Like you.

606
01:04:01,994 --> 01:04:02,945
Huh?

607
01:04:04,181 --> 01:04:05,209
I said you're beautiful.

608
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:10,029
That's funny?

609
01:04:20,368 --> 01:04:22,342
Looks like someone might be rolling.

610
01:04:22,377 --> 01:04:25,656
All right, come on. Come on, it's time to go dance.

611
01:04:48,306 --> 01:04:49,117
Nina!

612
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:28,231
Hey, what the fuck? Where you going?

613
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:51,823
Nina!

614
01:05:53,228 --> 01:05:54,098
Where are you going?

615
01:07:17,877 --> 01:07:20,158
Do you have any idea what time it is?

616
01:07:20,193 --> 01:07:22,050
Late?

617
01:07:24,845 --> 01:07:26,102
Where have you been?

618
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:29,084
To the moon and back.

619
01:07:31,143 --> 01:07:33,526
- You've been drinking. - Ding ding ding ding ding!

620
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,264
- What else? - Hmm?

621
01:07:35,276 --> 01:07:37,824
What else have you been doing?

622
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:41,430
Oh, you want to know their names?

623
01:07:43,621 --> 01:07:47,320
- You need to sleep this off. - There were two. Tom and Jerry.

624
01:07:47,343 --> 01:07:49,762
- Be quiet, Nina. - And I fucked them both.

625
01:07:49,785 --> 01:07:51,851
Shut your mouth!

626
01:08:04,804 --> 01:08:05,982
- Don't come in here. - What's this?

627
01:08:06,017 --> 01:08:09,387
It's called privacy. I'm not twelve anymore.

628
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:11,969
- You're not my Nina right now... - Leave me alone!

629
01:10:09,988 --> 01:10:11,456
Sweat girl.

630
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:09,879
Why didn't you wake me up?

631
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,626
I'm moving out.

632
01:11:18,363 --> 01:11:19,118
My music!

633
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:38,411
Thomas, I am so sorry.

634
01:11:38,446 --> 01:11:40,325
Keep on going.

635
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:42,975
Go get warmed up.

636
01:12:25,655 --> 01:12:26,212
That was good.

637
01:12:28,832 --> 01:12:29,701
Actually, really good.

638
01:12:29,736 --> 01:12:31,908
Okay, let's take ten.

639
01:12:40,141 --> 01:12:42,498
Look, he just wanted to mark it and asked me to step up, okay?

640
01:12:43,417 --> 01:12:44,632
I overslept.

641
01:12:45,584 --> 01:12:48,333
Oops. But hey, at least you had a good time, right?

642
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:50,008
You put something in my drink.

643
01:12:50,043 --> 01:12:51,838
Yeah.

644
01:12:51,873 --> 01:12:53,540
And then you just took off in the morning.

645
01:12:54,998 --> 01:12:55,723
In the morning?

646
01:12:55,758 --> 01:12:57,692
Yeah, you slept over.

647
01:13:00,253 --> 01:13:01,115
Um, no.

648
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:05,508
Unless your name's Tom and you had a dick.

649
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:06,690


650
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:09,137
What, Nina?

651
01:13:14,863 --> 01:13:18,189
Did you have some sort of lesbian wet dream about me?

652
01:13:18,224 --> 01:13:20,626
- Stop. - Oh my God!

653
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:23,969
Oh my God, you did! You fantasized about me!

654
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:26,416
- Shut up! - Was I good?

655
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:11,858
The final act.

656
01:15:11,864 --> 01:15:13,848
You're trying to dance.

657
01:15:16,237 --> 01:15:19,476
You've tasted your dream! Touched it!

658
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:23,837
Only to have it crushed!

659
01:15:27,187 --> 01:15:28,925
Your heart is broken,

660
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,285
wounded. Your life force fading.

661
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:36,004
The blood drips.

662
01:15:38,008 --> 01:15:42,260
The Black Swan stole your love. There is only one way to end the pain.

663
01:15:44,397 --> 01:15:47,894
You are not fearful, but filled with acceptance.

664
01:15:50,147 --> 01:15:53,158
And you look down at Rothbart,

665
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:54,278
and then at the Prince,

666
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:59,394
and then, yes, at the audience.

667
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:02,519
And then you jump.

668
01:16:06,112 --> 01:16:08,174
Go ahead. Jump. Jump!

669
01:16:19,435 --> 01:16:22,542
Okay, everybody get a drink of water, then it's notes.

670
01:16:34,746 --> 01:16:35,940
You lost weight.

671
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:37,582
Take off your shrug, please.

672
01:16:49,324 --> 01:16:50,081
Very good.

673
01:16:56,852 --> 01:16:58,336
Face front. We're almost done.

674
01:17:02,596 --> 01:17:04,618
And that's it. Okay.

675
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,749
We're done. Thank you very much.

676
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:12,157
Georgina, I'm Lily. Thomas sent me...

677
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:14,997
Yes, we have to get you measured for the Swan Queen costumes.

678
01:17:15,032 --> 01:17:16,158
What's she doing here?

679
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:19,721
He made me your alternate.

680
01:17:21,839 --> 01:17:22,873
Look, it's just in case.

681
01:17:25,514 --> 01:17:27,992
Thomas. Thomas.

682
01:17:28,015 --> 01:17:29,123
- Thomas. - Yes?

683
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:31,276
It can't be her.

684
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:33,174
It can't be her.

685
01:17:33,209 --> 01:17:34,690
Okay, why don't you just go. I'll catch up later.

686
01:17:34,725 --> 01:17:36,474
What's going on?

687
01:17:36,509 --> 01:17:39,541
Lily... You made her my alternate?

688
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:43,838
There's always an alternate. Lily is the best choice.

689
01:17:43,873 --> 01:17:45,272
No, she wants my role.

690
01:17:45,307 --> 01:17:47,645
Every dancer in the world wants your role.

691
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,177
No, this is different. She is after me.

692
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:53,629
- She is trying to replace me. - Nobody is after you.

693
01:17:53,664 --> 01:17:56,506
- No, please believe me...

694
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:04,379
I know it's been a struggle. But you just had a breakthrough this morning.

695
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:10,780
Tomorrow is yours. Just give a great performance and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else.

696
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:15,412
Now go home and rest.

697
01:18:29,211 --> 01:18:31,135
From the vision again.

698
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:49,267
What happened?

699
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:55,361
I've got a life.don't work too hard. It's a big day tomorrow.

700
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:41,445
I'm still working in here.

701
01:19:51,966 --> 01:19:53,454
Could you please turn the lights back on?

702
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:00,058
Hello?

703
01:21:48,389 --> 01:21:49,473
What are you doing here?

704
01:21:49,508 --> 01:21:51,415
I'm so sorry.

705
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,748
I'm so sorry.

706
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:58,361
I know how it feels now. She's trying to replace me.

707
01:21:59,605 --> 01:22:00,979
What do I do?

708
01:22:03,038 --> 01:22:05,415
You stole my things?

709
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,089
I was just trying to be perfect, like you.

710
01:22:10,944 --> 01:22:11,684
Perfect?

711
01:22:17,596 --> 01:22:18,827
I'm not perfect.

712
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:22,335
I'm nothing.

713
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:27,895
Nothing!

714
01:22:36,807 --> 01:22:38,102
Nothing, nothing!

715
01:23:25,161 --> 01:23:26,040
Sweet girl.

716
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:47,947
Mommy?

717
01:23:52,493 --> 01:23:54,370
Sweet girl. Sweet girl.

718
01:23:57,757 --> 01:24:00,524
Stop!

719
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:10,191
What are you doing?

720
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:13,596
Sweetie?

721
01:24:20,327 --> 01:24:21,522
Nina?

722
01:24:21,572 --> 01:24:23,309
Nina!

723
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:25,162
Go away!

724
01:24:26,126 --> 01:24:27,613
£¡
Open the door!

725
01:24:27,648 --> 01:24:28,845
Go away!

726
01:24:37,117 --> 01:24:39,425
Open the door, Nina!

727
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:41,562
Nina!

728
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:54,873
Get out!

729
01:24:54,908 --> 01:24:56,600
- What's wrong with you? - Get out!

730
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:58,639
- Get out! - What do you see?

731
01:24:58,689 --> 01:25:00,895
Get out!

732
01:25:39,137 --> 01:25:40,806
It's okay.

733
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:42,910
I'm here.

734
01:25:46,446 --> 01:25:48,846
You were scratching all night.

735
01:25:48,896 --> 01:25:51,147
Where's my clock?

736
01:25:51,197 --> 01:25:54,023
- Don't worry about that. - What time is it?

737
01:25:54,468 --> 01:25:56,731
- The show is tonight, I have to... - No, no, no, no.

738
01:25:56,781 --> 01:25:58,051
Don't worry.

739
01:25:58,101 --> 01:26:01,067
I called the theater and I told them you aren't feeling well.

740
01:26:01,117 --> 01:26:02,203
I have to go!

741
01:26:02,253 --> 01:26:04,349
- No. No, you don't. - Let go of me.

742
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,533
You're staying in here until you feel better.

743
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:10,602
Where is it?

744
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:14,019
This role is destroying you.

745
01:26:15,174 --> 01:26:16,759
- Move. Move! - Nina...!

746
01:26:16,809 --> 01:26:20,762
- What happened to my sweet girl? - She's gone!

747
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,773
Nina! Oh, Nina!

748
01:26:24,192 --> 01:26:25,519
No, please!

749
01:26:25,554 --> 01:26:27,671
- You're not well! - Let go of me!

750
01:26:27,721 --> 01:26:28,840
You can't handle this.

751
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,705
I can't?

752
01:26:30,755 --> 01:26:34,335
I'm the Swan Queen. You're the one who never left the corps.

753
01:26:35,373 --> 01:26:36,666
Nina!

754
01:26:52,603 --> 01:26:53,932
What are you doing here?

755
01:26:53,967 --> 01:26:55,183
Nina?

756
01:26:55,233 --> 01:26:56,391
She was supposed to be sick.

757
01:26:56,441 --> 01:26:58,626
Give us a minute.

758
01:27:04,022 --> 01:27:04,570
Are you okay?

759
01:27:04,805 --> 01:27:06,237
I'm fine.

760
01:27:09,533 --> 01:27:11,516
Nina.

761
01:27:13,301 --> 01:27:14,298
Nina.

762
01:27:14,348 --> 01:27:15,400
What?

763
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:18,117
I've already asked Lily.

764
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:20,646
Have you announced it?

765
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:26,729
After Beth, do you really need another controversy?

766
01:27:30,655 --> 01:27:32,247
I'm here, Thomas.

767
01:27:32,297 --> 01:27:34,306
I'm doing it.

768
01:27:39,974 --> 01:27:42,355
The only person standing in your way is you.

769
01:27:42,405 --> 01:27:47,593
It's time to let it go. Lose yourself.

770
01:28:02,211 --> 01:28:04,343
White Swan, up in ten.

771
01:28:57,768 --> 01:29:00,026
What are you doing? You need to be upstage.

772
01:31:00,829 --> 01:31:02,264
You suck.

773
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:05,284
Okay, Nina.

774
01:31:43,864 --> 01:31:45,103
What the fuck?

775
01:32:29,767 --> 01:32:32,192
- Are you okay? - Nina, are you okay?

776
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:43,035
Can you tell me what the fuck happened?

777
01:32:46,258 --> 01:32:48,629
- It wasn't my fault. He dropped me. - This is a fucking disaster.

778
01:32:56,368 --> 01:33:00,414
Rough start, huh? Must have been pretty humiliating.

779
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:02,941
Get out of my room.

780
01:33:02,991 --> 01:33:05,944
I'm worried about the next act.

781
01:33:07,307 --> 01:33:09,152
I'm just not sure you're feeling up to it.

782
01:33:09,202 --> 01:33:10,687
Stop. Please stop.

783
01:33:10,737 --> 01:33:16,524
How about I dance the Black Swan for you?

784
01:33:18,276 --> 01:33:21,287
Leave me alone!

785
01:33:32,727 --> 01:33:33,889
My turn!

786
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:35,509
My turn!

787
01:33:35,544 --> 01:33:37,294
My turn!

788
01:33:43,892 --> 01:33:46,103
It's my turn!

789
01:34:05,226 --> 01:34:07,184
Black Swan, places in five.

790
01:37:09,524 --> 01:37:11,932
Come on.

791
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,452
Good job. Fifteen to the last act.

792
01:38:26,749 --> 01:38:29,751
Hey. You were amazing.

793
01:38:29,801 --> 01:38:33,509
Seriously, I know that things got a little messed up between us,

794
01:38:33,559 --> 01:38:37,497
but I mean, holy shit, you completely blew me away!

795
01:38:39,661 --> 01:38:41,584
Okay, well I guess that's it.

796
01:38:41,634 --> 01:38:43,907
So I'll let you finish. Bye.

797
01:42:08,054 --> 01:42:09,688
Can you hear them?

798
01:42:09,923 --> 01:42:12,628
They love you!

799
01:42:12,663 --> 01:42:16,355
My little princess, I always knew you had it in you.

800
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:19,010
Come on. Let's take you out.

801
01:42:25,233 --> 01:42:25,986
Go get some help.

802
01:42:26,021 --> 01:42:26,985
Go get some help!

803
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:28,452
What did you do?

804
01:42:28,487 --> 01:42:29,608
What did you do?

805
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:33,800
- I felt it. - What?

806
01:42:33,835 --> 01:42:36,115
I felt perfect.

807
01:42:41,932 --> 01:42:43,130
I was perfect.

808
01:42:53,778 --> 01:42:56,847
Nina! Nina! Nina!
