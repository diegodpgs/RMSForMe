1
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,844
<i>I was cast into being
in the winter of 1795.</i>

2
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,771
<i>A living corpse without a soul,</i>

3
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,488
<i>- stitched, jolted...</i>

4
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,245
<i>bludgeoned back to life by a madman.</i>

5
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,883
<i>Horrified by his creation,
he tried to destroy me.</i>

6
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,684
<i>But I survived and found
my way back to him.</i>

7
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,526
Elizabeth!

8
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,484
<i>A life for a life,
that's what I wanted.</i>

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,405
<i>I took that of his beloved new bride.</i>

10
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
<i>He pursued me to the far north.</i>

11
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,362
<i>I was immune to the cold.</i>

12
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,771
<i>He was not.</i>

13
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,885
<i>I buried him in his family cemetery.</i>

14
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,328
<i>It was more than he deserved.</i>

15
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,482
<i>I thought it was the end,</i>

16
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,282
<i>but it was actually just the beginning.</i>

17
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,007
We have been waiting for you.

18
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,441
You will come with us.

19
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,931
Stop! Naberius wanted
it brought back alive!

20
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,008
That was the last of them.

21
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
What do you suppose it was?

22
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,091
I don't know.

23
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,442
Never seen a human kill a demon before,

24
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,051
and with such strength.

25
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,966
It's been a long time

26
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,088
since I've seen demons this far north.

27
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,888
There must have been something
special about it,

28
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
something Naberius wanted.

29
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,449
"Victor Frankenstein."

30
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,801
The rumors are true.

31
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,962
It's alive.

32
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,049
It's alive!

33
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,001
Your Majesty!

34
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,082
No more than a wild beast, Your Majesty.

35
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,721
Destroy it and be done with this.

36
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,131
So, you understand reason.

37
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,367
Where am I? How did I get here?

38
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,728
The creatures that attacked you,
what did they want?

39
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,451
- I don't know!
- We heard them speak of Naberius.

40
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,170
Seems he wants this thing alive.

41
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,204
If Naberius wants it alive,

42
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,123
all the more reason to destroy it.

43
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
No!

44
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,651
Gideon.

45
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,205
"Him," not "it."

46
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,844
My name is Leonore,

47
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,002
High Queen of the Gargoyle Order.

48
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,129
This is Gideon, my most trusted warrior.

49
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,050
You were attacked by four demons

50
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,727
under the command of
a dark prince called Naberius.

51
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,807
Fortunately, Ophir and Keziah
were on watch nearby.

52
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
They realized who you were
and brought you here,

53
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,242
to our home.

54
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,843
The Gargoyle Order
was commanded into being

55
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,763
by the great Archangel Michael.

56
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,845
It is our sacred duty to wage
war against the demon horde.

57
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,526
666 legions of hell-spawned creatures

58
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,887
unleashed by Satan after
his fall from heaven.

59
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,051
Humans think of us as mere decoration.

60
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,121
They do not know, nor could they conceive
of the brutal, unseen war

61
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,004
being fought around them every day.

62
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,886
A war that may one day
determine the very fate

63
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,166
of all mankind.

64
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,249
You have now been drawn into this war.

65
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,569
I care not for the world of man.

66
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,206
Yes, we've heard the stories of you.

67
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,162
Shunned by your human creator,
lost and alone.

68
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,323
You would be welcome here.

69
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,920
Until we learn why Naberius wants you,

70
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,043
I ask that you stay with us,

71
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,361
safe within these hallowed walls.

72
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,001
<i>L</i> 90 my own way.

73
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,647
Your Majesty, this thing
murdered Victor Frankenstein's wife.

74
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,410
All in the heat of passion,

75
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
driven by emotions he was
never taught to control.

76
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,809
He may be more human than he realizes.

77
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,729
I understand Frankenstein
never offered you a name.

78
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,485
I should like to call you

79
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,326
Adam.

80
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,410
I promise you this, Adam.

81
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,448
Each of us has a higher purpose.

82
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,808
Yours has simply yet to reveal itself.

83
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,529
These are but some of the scapulars

84
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,125
of our fallen brothers and sisters.

85
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,328
We have always been outnumbered in battle.

86
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,647
Now, after many hard-fought victories,

87
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,285
our ranks have thinned.

88
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,081
Demons, however, remain strong.

89
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,045
To help you survive against them,

90
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,482
the Queen has asked us
to provide you with weapons.

91
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,690
Demons can only be descended
by sacramentals,

92
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,527
blessed objects such
as the crucifix or holy water.

93
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,890
Any object can be made
sacramental by marking them

94
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,889
with the blessed symbol
of the Gargoyle Order.

95
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,841
Descended?

96
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,240
When a demon is killed

97
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,523
its spirit descends to hell,

98
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,042
where it remains trapped for all eternity.

99
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,204
How do you descend a gargoyle?

100
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,205
We are sacramental beings of
light and good. We ascend.

101
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,087
And only at the hands of godless creatures
that have no souls.

102
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,006
You do not want those.
They are blunt and crude,

103
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,208
and far too heavy to wield.

104
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,729
Adam, you have strength
and speed and stamina

105
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,083
far beyond that of any human.
You could use those gifts.

106
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,124
Take sides in a war that
you are already a part of.

107
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,811
I do not care how many demons it descended.

108
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,085
You should've let me destroy it.

109
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,527
I am not blind to the risks.

110
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,287
The fact is, Adam is alive,

111
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,684
and all life is sacred.

112
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,367
- It is not human born.
- Neither are we, Gideon.

113
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,801
Here.

114
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,811
Lock this in the vault.

115
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,400
It must never fall into Naberius' hands.

116
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,209
It is but a book, Your Majesty.

117
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,803
It is written proof that God is now
no longer the sole creator of man.

118
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,560
Adam.

119
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,049
If ever you should change your mind,

120
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,004
you will always find refuge here.

121
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,490
<i>Trusting others is</i>
a <i>mistake you only make once.</i>

122
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,649
<i>And so I resolved to seek out</i>

123
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,087
<i>the farthest corners of the earth</i>

124
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,207
<i>where no human,</i>

125
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,443
<i>demon or gargoyle would ever find me.</i>

126
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,444
<i>So many years passed, I lost track of time,</i>

127
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,409
<i>yet I did not grow old and die,</i>

128
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,164
<i>as humans do.</i>

129
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,449
<i>Victor Frankenstein's final curse.</i>

130
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,284
<i>I thought Naberius'
demons had forgotten me.</i>

131
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,490
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

132
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,410
<i>And I unleashed all my rage upon them.</i>

133
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,524
<i>I had hidden long enough.</i>

134
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,082
<i>Now, I would hunt those
who were hunting me.</i>

135
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,929
<i>I returned to the place
I had left so long ago.</i>

136
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,244
<i>The human world had changed
in the time I had been gone.</i>

137
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,561
<i>But some things had not changed.</i>

138
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,601
<i>If the demons could find
me in the wilderness,</i>

139
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,963
<i>it was only a matter of time
before they found me here.</i>

140
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,529
<i>Which is why I had to find them first.</i>

141
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,608
Naberius, where is he?

142
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,364
Police!

143
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,605
Put down your weapon!

144
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,090
Good evening, Mr. Wessex.

145
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,364
Where does life begin
and where does it end?

146
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,604
Tonight's experiment represents the
culmination of three years of work...

147
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,044
Time is fleeting, Dr. Wade.
I'd ask that you not waste mine.

148
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,249
Commencing reanimation sequence.

149
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,607
Patch clamp amplifier set.

150
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,290
<i>Pulse generators calibrated.</i>

151
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,284
ICD wiring in right ventricle.

152
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,200
<i>TERRA". Energy output set to three joules.</i>

153
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,250
For the record,
subject's heart is currently dormant.

154
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,410
Firing current in three, two, one.

155
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,125
Clear and shock.

156
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,856
Muscle spasms
in the upper torso and legs.

157
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,881
<i>Looks good.</i>

158
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,566
Detecting intracellular electrical activity
in both atria.

159
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,761
We are in the ventricles.

160
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,880
We have an atrial flutter.
Watch out for ectopics.

161
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,730
Irregular ectopic beats
have begun on schedule.

162
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,404
Ventricular fibrillation.
Subject's going into cardiac arrest.

163
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,450
Up the current to 50 joules.

164
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,561
Current raised to 50.

165
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,720
The heart rate's spiking.
There's no defibrillation.

166
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,206
- Double it.
- Current set to 100.

167
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,249
Pulse is fading! Terra!

168
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,807
Double it again!

169
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,405
- No, I can't!
- I said double it!

170
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,481
That'll kill it!

171
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,641
It's already dead!

172
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,920
200 joules.

173
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,921
Come on.

174
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,769
Live.

175
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,690
There's a heartbeat.

176
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,204
Switch to life support.

177
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,281
Life support functioning.

178
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,040
Sinus rhythm established.

179
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,361
It's breathing.

180
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,282
Sir, we have a situation.

181
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,650
You're certain?

182
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,005
No, sir. But the way it attacked,

183
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,401
strong and fast, like a gargoyle.

184
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,929
It descended seven of us.
I managed to fight it off.

185
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,891
I think I wounded it. I think it's wounded.

186
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,843
It descended seven demons,

187
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,964
yet you escaped?

188
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,601
Well, I thought you'd want to hear this.

189
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,321
Yes, you presumed.

190
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,528
You presumed to know what I want.

191
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,842
Well, considering how long

192
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,524
you've been hunting the creature...

193
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,207
And you thought I'd want you
to tell me about the creature

194
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,487
rather than capture it yourself.

195
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,688
That's the choice you made.

196
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,891
Yeah.

197
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,850
It's interesting.

198
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,966
Do not ever

199
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,725
presume to know what I want.

200
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,323
Is that understood?

201
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,171
Forgive me,

202
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,529
Prince Naberius.

203
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,685
Ophir, if you think...

204
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,444
No.

205
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,726
No!

206
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,929
When do you begin the final stage?

207
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,611
Uh, Mr. Wessex, our bodies
are the most complex

208
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,170
living organisms in the universe.

209
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,807
Animating a simple rat is one thing,

210
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,804
but a human is still far out of reach.

211
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,322
Is it? What do you know of a scientist

212
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,966
by the name of Victor Frankenstein?

213
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,964
Frankenstein is a myth.

214
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,964
A horror story made up to scare children.

215
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,209
All scientists are skeptics, Dr. Wade.

216
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,770
However, I would've suspected

217
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,320
that a scientist in your particular field

218
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,408
would have to wonder if such stories

219
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,528
just might have some basis in fact.

220
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,365
Well, electricity couldn't be
harnessed in the 1790s

221
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,887
let alone channeled into a...
A human subject.

222
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,124
And where did he go?
Why did he disappear?

223
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,362
If he really animated a human corpse,

224
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,408
why not share his technology
with the rest of the world

225
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,528
to save lives, cure paralysis?

226
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,561
Perhaps he wasn't as magnanimous
as you are, Doctor.

227
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,400
Every scientist keeps a record.

228
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,962
Even when their experiments end in failure.

229
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,880
Look, there ought to be at least
a record of his work somewhere.

230
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,249
Drawings or a set of notes. Something.

231
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,482
Just because something is yet to be found,

232
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,728
does not mean it doesn't exist.

233
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,006
But if Frankenstein was real,

234
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,045
if he really did animate a human,

235
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,921
would it help you to study it?

236
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,566
Well, yes, absolutely.

237
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,566
But, Mr. Wessex,

238
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,768
it would have to be over
200 years old by now.

239
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,202
There would be nothing left
but a few brittle bones.

240
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,603
It's the first and only one
of its kind, Dr. Wade.

241
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,687
Who's to say how long
such a subject might live?

242
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,211
Ours is a war that must be
fought in the shadows.

243
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,490
It is not an open battlefield
for you to do as you please.

244
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm descending demons, aren't I?

245
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,646
Do not pretend that you are
doing this for us or mankind!

246
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,207
You care only about yourself, Adam.

247
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,856
Do you know a human was killed
in that alley tonight?

248
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,881
I didn't kill him.

249
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,243
Your actions led directly to his death.

250
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,731
I'll be more careful next time.

251
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,843
There will not be a next time.

252
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,560
You will remain here until the Queen
decides what to do with you.

253
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,684
You cannot keep me here, Leonore.

254
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,730
I can hardly risk unleashing you
on the streets of this city.

255
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,288
My life is my own.
You will not take it from me.

256
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,364
Your life was not granted
to you by the grace of God!

257
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,608
It was fabricated in a laboratory!

258
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,764
And until you learn to use it wisely,
I will do what I must!

259
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,445
Then you are no better than Naberius!

260
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,001
When I met you,

261
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,090
my first thought was to have you destroyed.

262
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,050
But then I looked into your eyes,

263
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,610
and do you know what I saw there?

264
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,130
Not a soul, but the potential for one.

265
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,726
Now, all I see is darkness.

266
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,283
I know of no other way.

267
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,325
I am not human,

268
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,970
nor a gargoyle,

269
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,970
nor a demon.

270
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,965
I am like none other.

271
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,006
Ophir.

272
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,721
How do you plan
to remove the creature from the cathedral?

273
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,048
The gargoyles will protect it
like one of their own.

274
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,162
Yes, I shall be counting on that.

275
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,041
Our casualties will be high, but necessary.

276
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,600
Zuriel, none of my legions

277
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,127
ever had so worthy a commander as you.

278
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,568
Would they have sacrificed
themselves so bravely,

279
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,803
so willingly for anyone less?

280
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,042
You know what this could mean for them.

281
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,083
Do not forget.

282
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,083
Now, bring me Frankenstein's monster!

283
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,929
Demons are gathering outside the cathedral.

284
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,163
- How many?
- Fifty or so.

285
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,726
By the power of God,
descend into hell,

286
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,604
Satan and all evil spirits.

287
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,965
Secure the creature!

288
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,490
- Now!
- Ophir.

289
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,486
Give no quarter.

290
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,800
Take as many of them with you as you can.

291
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,004
You're our last line of defense.

292
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,482
This is your sacred duty.

293
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,686
This way.

294
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,046
Ophir, give me a weapon!
Let me fight for my life!

295
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,368
- No!

296
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,051
Keziah. I'll do what I can.

297
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,363
No! I wish to be with Ophir.

298
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,322
It was forbidden by the Order.

299
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,162
It will not be so anymore.

300
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,647
Quickly, go help the others.

301
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,205
- Where's Naberius?
- They're expecting you.

302
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,044
What do you mean, expecting me?

303
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,002
We knew the gargoyles would
do everything they could

304
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,680
to keep you out of Naberius' hands.

305
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,883
<i>But in the heat of battle,</i>

306
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,725
<i>they left unprotected
their greatest treasure.</i>

307
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,282
All we had to do was lure
Gideon and the others away.

308
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,920
This one has a message for you.

309
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,851
From Zuriel.

310
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,403
Tell me where Zuriel took her.

311
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,681
What do you care?

312
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,961
Hmm?

313
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,923
You going to rescue her?

314
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,764
She locked you up! She despises you.

315
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,446
You are nothing to her,

316
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,531
but another grand human mistake!

317
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,000
Where is she?

318
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,528
Walton Theater!

319
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,491
Gideon is to bring you there
in exchange for Leonore.

320
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,523
Descend in pain, demon.

321
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,246
The light embraces and protects thee.

322
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,765
BARACHELI Sir.

323
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,611
What are your orders?

324
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,728
- I beg you to reconsider.
- There's no time.

325
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,926
Items in the vault are sacred.

326
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,082
You cannot remove or replace anything.

327
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,083
Then I shall accept full responsibility.

328
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,561
You have not the authority to do this.
None of us do.

329
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,489
And the Queen has expressly forbidden it.

330
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,125
Authority is not the problem.

331
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,690
It is dangerous. You must know this.

332
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,530
Of course, I know!

333
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,963
But Leonore is the spiritual
leader of the entire Order.

334
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,123
Our only direct link to the archangels.

335
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,523
And without her,
we're but a dying flock of vigilantes

336
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,364
with no hope of ever being reinforced.

337
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,841
Is that what you want?

338
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,129
May God forgive me.

339
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,042
Stay where you are, Gideon!

340
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,566
Your Majesty.

341
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,802
- You should not have come.
- Weapons!

342
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,125
I am unarmed. As you instructed.

343
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,563
Where is Frankenstein's creature?

344
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,126
I no longer know.

345
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,729
When I returned to the cathedral,
it had already escaped.

346
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,725
Wait!

347
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,726
I've brought something else.

348
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,402
Gideon, no!

349
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,526
This is the private scientific journal
of Victor Frankenstein.

350
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,569
We found it on Frankenstein's body

351
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,325
the night we rescued
the creature 200 years ago.

352
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,480
It contains, in detail,

353
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,804
how Victor Frankenstein conceived,

354
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,884
and then constructed
his unholy abomination.

355
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,520
And I pray that it might save my Queen now.

356
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,369
Gideon, I command you,
take the journal from this place,

357
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,641
and let me ascend.

358
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,763
This one came in
just this morning.

359
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,928
Morgue sold him to us.

360
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,206
The liver was ruined,

361
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,089
but the other organs are healthy enough.

362
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,569
Store it with the rest.

363
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,327
What is that?

364
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,370
It looks like Victor Frankenstein's
handwritten account

365
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,283
of how he brought his creature to life.

366
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,964
This is better for us.

367
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,530
This is everything we need
to bring back our fallen.

368
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,161
We'll let the humans decide that.

369
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,607
You asked for Frankenstein's creature.

370
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,524
I bring you something far more edifying.

371
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,686
"Frankenstein."

372
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,524
You said there must be a record
of his work somewhere.

373
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,200
- Uh... Where did you get this?
- Is this real?

374
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,331
You tell me.

375
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,808
We lost 16.

376
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,088
Good warriors, all of them.

377
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,601
I should never have held him here.

378
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,246
This was the creature's doing, not yours.

379
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,440
If it had not come back...

380
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,403
Was I wrong to keep the journal from him?

381
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,403
Everything you do
is for the good of humanity.

382
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,209
There is no wrong in that.

383
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,006
However, now that the creature
knows of the journal's existence...

384
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,491
Why must you call him that?

385
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,729
Now that "he" knows,
what are you prepared to do?

386
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,765
Find Adam!

387
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,444
Call every gargoyle you can spare.

388
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,010
Post them on every rooftop.

389
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,923
And when we find him?

390
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,082
Do we bring him back here again?

391
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,441
Sacrifice even more of us to protect him?

392
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,404
Or do we finally put an end to all of this,
and deny Naberius his prize,

393
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,840
as we should have done long ago?

394
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,123
God may not have put Adam on this earth,
but he did allow him to live

395
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,044
for over 200 years against incredible odds.

396
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,122
It is not for you or I
to deny God's purpose.

397
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,400
Well, sooner or later, Your Majesty,

398
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,770
you will have no choice.

399
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,041
Eels.

400
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,487
What was that?

401
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,287
Electric eels,
that's where he got his power from.

402
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,136
You know, it's actually a fish...

403
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,164
Six electric eels
generating 500 volts each.

404
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,291
That's 3,000 volts.

405
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,488
That's enough to kill an elephant.

406
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,569
How long did he hold the current for?

407
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,722
Three bursts of five seconds each.

408
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,724
That's 15,000 joules.

409
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,765
Makes you wonder how
long that thing lasted.

410
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,644
Think of it, all that energy
coursing through its veins

411
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,323
powering its heart, lungs, nervous system.

412
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,284
Well, if it survived that at birth,

413
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,971
what would it take to kill it?

414
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,007
Look at its eyes.

415
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,565
The way they hold you.

416
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,565
It suggests a certain
level of intelligence.

417
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,406
Maybe Victor Frankenstein
just drew it that way.

418
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,641
I want to re-examine our
cellular reproduction formula.

419
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,960
I think we've missed something.

420
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,004
Leave him be!

421
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,450
My apologies for the zealous
nature of our security.

422
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,683
Perhaps if you'd simply
knocked on the front door,

423
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,845
this unfortunate awkwardness
might have been avoided.

424
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,001
Who are you?

425
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,691
Charles Wessex.

426
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,284
And you must be Frankenstein.

427
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,450
My name is Adam.

428
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,490
We are all the sons
of our fathers, are we not?

429
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,682
Denying who we are only
means that we are lost.

430
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,568
I am a journeyman,

431
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,208
a partisan of progress.

432
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,403
Like your father, I too seek

433
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,290
to unravel the mortal coils of life.

434
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,881
This is Dr. Wade.

435
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,123
She's one of the world's
most respected electrophysiologists.

436
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,721
Hello.

437
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,247
I have been trying to replicate

438
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,687
Victor Frankenstein's stunning triumph

439
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,931
for quite some time.

440
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,369
What I've read of the journal
has already been extremely helpful.

441
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,323
Be reasonable, Adam.

442
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,531
You are a living miracle.

443
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,048
You contain the answers so many seek.

444
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,409
I seek my own answers.

445
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,403
Of course you do.

446
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,005
Stay with us.

447
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,328
Help us understand your father's work,

448
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,802
and, together, we can unlock
those answers and more.

449
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,601
Yes...

450
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,450
Victor Frankenstein gave you life,

451
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,610
but he could not restore your soul.

452
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,166
Could he?

453
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,086
There's no sign of the creature.
He could be anywhere by now.

454
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,561
He will find a safe place

455
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,563
where he can study the journal,
then it will come back here.

456
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,641
Come back?

457
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,361
I've been pursuing the creature
for the better part of 200 years.

458
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,324
- It will come back.
- For what?

459
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,843
Mr. Wessex.

460
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,046
Answers.

461
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,685
How can I help you, Doctor?

462
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,046
Well, you can start by
please explaining to me

463
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,610
what is going on.

464
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,001
We had a break-in.
It's a simple security matter.

465
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,127
With all due respect, sir,

466
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,124
but Frankenstein's creature is alive.

467
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,681
- Why don't you go home and get some rest?
- Look, just who are you?

468
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,047
This gentleman works for me.

469
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,129
A sort of extra layer of
security, if you will.

470
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,961
Well, your extra layer of security

471
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,923
just blew any hopes I might have had

472
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,121
of analyzing that creature.

473
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,568
Didn't you hear what it said?
It wants answers!

474
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,523
And I am the one who might've
been able to provide them!

475
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,045
The only one!

476
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,006
You may be right. You look tired, Doctor.

477
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,080
It's late.

478
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,929
You really ought to get some rest.

479
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,889
Rest? Mr. Wessex...

480
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,611
We've lost both the creature
and the journal, Doctor.

481
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,330
- What more can you do tonight?
- But, Mr...

482
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,641
I will notify you should we recover the one

483
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,086
or the other.

484
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,611
Go home, Doctor!

485
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,001
<i>"I am not recording
the visions of</i> a <i>madman."</i>

486
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,121
<i>My methods and reasons
are scientifically sound.</i>

487
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,090
<i>Succeeded discovering the cause...</i>

488
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,691
<i>and generation of life.</i>

489
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,925
<i>A graveyard has furnished
the few raw materials I required.</i>

490
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,650
<i>Tonight, I gather my instruments...</i>

491
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,487
<i>shatter the ideal
bounds of life and death!</i>

492
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,766
Thank you.

493
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,921
How certain are you it will come for her?

494
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,761
It needs someone to make sense
of the journal.

495
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,370
Only she can do that.

496
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,925
I'm not going to hurt you.

497
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,410
Come with me.

498
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,886
Why are you following me?

499
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,167
How close are you
to re-animating a human corpse?

500
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,131
- I can't tell you that.
- Would this help?

501
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,205
Oh, I haven't had the
chance to finish it yet.

502
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,523
What if you examined me?

503
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,204
Back at the Institute?

504
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,886
Not there. Somewhere away from it.

505
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,647
But all my equipment's there.
My notes, my research!

506
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,802
You don't know who it
is you're working for.

507
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,920
Mr. Wessex?

508
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,120
He's not who you think he is.

509
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,726
There's a war...
A war humans don't know about.

510
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,849
It's been going on for centuries.

511
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,128
It could mean the end of all mankind.

512
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,084
Between who?

513
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,765
Gargoyles and demons.

514
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,208
I think your boss is a demon prince

515
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,891
called Naberius.

516
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,121
A demon prince?

517
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,803
Been hunting me for over 200 years.

518
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,081
Now, I think I know why.

519
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,204
We have to get off the streets.

520
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,041
Come on.

521
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,563
Naberius is storing human corpses
underneath the Wessex Institute.

522
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,687
Corpses?

523
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,766
No, we're still years
away from human trials.

524
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,046
I've seen the bodies.

525
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,244
There's enough to animate an entire army
of monsters like me.

526
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,441
What did you say that your name was? Adam?

527
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,921
That's the name
the Gargoyle Queen gave to me.

528
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,765
Look, I understand you probably suffered

529
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,650
severe brain damage during the
reanimation process given the level...

530
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,610
This is real! All of it!

531
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,210
I'm sorry. I...

532
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,445
I just don't believe in
gargoyles and demons.

533
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,250
Frankenstein!

534
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,609
Oh, shit.

535
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,611
Run.

536
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,486
This ends tonight.

537
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,489
I've seen the bodies.

538
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,444
You'll never be able to control them.

539
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,803
Control has never been the problem.

540
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,962
There are millions of demon spirits

541
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,485
trapped in hell

542
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,404
waiting for the chance
to possess a human body

543
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,642
and return to our world.

544
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,810
What's this got to do with me?

545
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,361
What's in hell that's got to do with me?

546
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,888
You have no soul,

547
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,450
and a demon spirit can only possess a body
that has no soul.

548
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,490
No. No.

549
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:30,096
You know what the best thing
about having the journal is?

550
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,211
I no longer need to bring you in alive.

551
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,960
I need it alive!

552
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,806
I need to study it!

553
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,160
Bring it back to the lab and...

554
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,601
You can read the journal
and study its corpse.

555
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,011
Its corpse won't show me
how its organs function,

556
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,486
how they respond to tests.

557
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,128
Let me bring it back to the lab
where I can open it up,

558
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,204
but keep it alive
while I run my tests for Mr. Wessex.

559
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,967
You can destroy it when I'm done.

560
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,561
The journal!

561
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,721
Ah!

562
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,289
It's okay. Come on.

563
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,722
I'm going to take your coat off now. Ready?

564
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,007
Look in the cabinet.

565
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,081
Okay.

566
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,127
Sit down.

567
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,327
Sit down, please.

568
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,090
It's okay.

569
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,080
Please, it's all right, you can sit down.

570
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,408
We can't stay here long.

571
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,320
Okay, hold still, please.

572
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,205
Demons will be looking for us everywhere.

573
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,806
We have to get to Leonore,
the Gargoyle Queen.

574
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,370
She's the only one who can help us now.

575
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,042
You saw that thing. You saw what it was.

576
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,201
I don't know what I saw.

577
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,649
They'll come for you.

578
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,531
- They need you to help them.
- Help them do what?

579
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,802
Animate an army of corpses
to take over the world?

580
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,685
- Corpses possessed by demons.
- It can't happen. it won't.

581
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,004
First thing they'll do is
wipe out the Gargoyle Order.

582
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,281
There's so few gargoyles left,
they won't stand a chance.

583
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,285
Then Naberius will launch a war on humans.

584
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,210
Kill most, enslave the rest.

585
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,886
Your world will end.

586
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,360
And what will you do?

587
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,240
It has nothing to do with me.

588
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,526
Of course, it does.

589
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,244
You're as much a part
of this world as anybody.

590
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,165
No, I'm different.

591
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,040
You're not that different.

592
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,091
I'm a dozen used parts
from eight different corpses.

593
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,401
I'm a monster.

594
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,923
You're only a monster
if you behave like one.

595
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,766
I've never had to thank
a human for anything before.

596
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,847
Well, we have our uses, I suppose.

597
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,081
Look, Adam...

598
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,770
The journal is not here, sir.

599
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,161
How are you feeling?

600
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,883
I've been through worse.

601
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,363
What happened to Victor Frankenstein?

602
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,483
They say he vanished after his...

603
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,046
Wife died.

604
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,961
I killed his Wife.

605
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,966
He hunted me.

606
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,003
I would've killed him, too.

607
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,729
But he froze to death.

608
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,171
I hated him.

609
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,721
Have you killed anyone since?

610
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,125
Only demons.

611
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,485
I finished reading it.

612
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,081
Seems he refined the process
significantly after you.

613
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,888
I mean, his science is still incredibly,
wildly out of the box,

614
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,045
but, um, I think I can reproduce it.

615
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,323
Perhaps even improve on it.

616
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,803
Frankenstein promised to make
you a companion, didn't he?

617
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,484
A promise he broke.

618
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,609
Is that why you came to me?

619
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,724
You want me to fulfill
Victor Frankenstein's promise?

620
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,851
<i>- Carl!
- I got your message.</i>

621
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,365
Thought you'd be asleep by now.

622
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,131
Carl, listen to me.
I want you to leave Wessex right now.

623
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,521
<i>Leave?</i>

624
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,080
And I want you to meet
me at the train station.

625
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:35,976
I've still got all the
data crunching to do.

626
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,240
Carl, please.

627
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,728
Please just trust me.
It's about the journal.

628
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,410
All right, I'll be there in 20.

629
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,204
Okay. Bye.

630
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,282
You shouldn't have done that.

631
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,963
Well, he knows as much about
the re-animation process as I do.

632
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,929
If what you say is true,
then he's in danger as well.

633
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,087
We don't need him.

634
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,804
This isn't about what you need right now.

635
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,646
I'll go with you, look after you.

636
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,370
You go talk to the Gargoyle Queen.

637
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,816
I'll meet you back here in an hour.

638
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,921
Terra!

639
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,680
That way you can just look after yourself.

640
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,130
You're good at that.

641
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,490
Here.

642
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,641
Carl!

643
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,321
I'm sorry.

644
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,286
- What?
- They made me do it.

645
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,885
I had no choice. They made me!

646
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,686
Behind you!

647
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,842
You have work to do, Dr. Wade.

648
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,121
Release him.

649
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,281
You lied to me.

650
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,407
Yes, I did.

651
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,007
But I had a higher duty
to protect the human race.

652
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,960
Do you understand
what that journal is to me?

653
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,363
It's the chronicle of how I came to be.

654
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,885
Who I am.

655
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,807
What I am.

656
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,802
You are a unique, lonely being

657
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,201
rejected by both your maker
and the rest of humanity.

658
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,926
And, as a result, you are filled with rage.

659
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,402
You do not need a book to tell you that.

660
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,644
Naberius has found a way to summon
every demon you've ever descended.

661
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,881
What?

662
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,246
Possession,

663
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,722
in bodies that have no souls.

664
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,361
Only the dead have no souls.

665
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,962
- What is the use of possessing a corpse?
- There is none.

666
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,968
Unless you could animate that corpse.

667
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,161
Naberius has been planning
this for centuries.

668
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,448
Victor Frankenstein just made it possible.

669
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,287
- How do you know all this?
- I've seen the bodies.

670
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,604
There are tens of thousands of them.

671
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,041
Where?

672
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,085
We are your friends, Adam.

673
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,001
We will never try to control you again.

674
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,368
But if you have Victor
Frankenstein's journal,

675
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,205
surely you see now that
it must be destroyed.

676
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,402
My circumstances have changed.

677
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,528
I have someone with me now, a human.

678
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,161
A scientist.

679
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,201
I have to protect her.

680
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,124
What would you have us do?

681
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,361
Get us out of here.

682
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,009
Then I will tell you where to find him.

683
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,608
Retrieve your scientist, come back here,

684
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,842
then we shall take you
where you wish to go.

685
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,808
I've made too many mistakes with you, Adam.

686
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,331
I'll not make another.

687
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,167
You put your emotion
before your sacred duty!

688
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,361
Follow him, Gideon.

689
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,529
As soon as you have the journal in sight,

690
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,001
destroy him.

691
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,005
Terra?

692
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,810
Remember... I have no soul.

693
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,208
God will surely damn you.

694
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,005
He already did.

695
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,046
I know who you are,

696
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,323
and I know what you want me to do.

697
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,406
And I won't do it.

698
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,801
I'd rather die.

699
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,764
Carl!

700
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,922
Carl!

701
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,325
Do you want him back?

702
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,610
Show me how.

703
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,165
Excellent.

704
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,600
Thank you, Dr. Wade.

705
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,330
My Queen!

706
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,006
We found the creature.

707
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,282
Sir, it's here.

708
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,965
"Him," not "it."

709
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,401
This is the place.

710
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,926
He led us here.

711
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,444
Leave him to me!

712
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,887
Naberius!

713
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,326
Frankenstein.

714
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,122
How good of you to come back.

715
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,841
I've come to destroy you and this place.

716
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,528
The Gargoyle Order must survive

717
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,688
and mankind with it.

718
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,242
You cannot destroy me,

719
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,971
and I have many other places such as this

720
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,609
all over the world.

721
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:08,568
As for the Order and mankind,

722
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:14,090
nothing can stop their demise,
let alone a monster like you!

723
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,320
Too late, Dr. Wade.

724
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,326
We already have everything
we need from you.

725
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,331
I am a demon prince!

726
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,529
You will kneel before me!

727
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,130
I know what you want, Adam.
What you've always wanted.

728
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,364
I will make hundreds like you.

729
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,091
<i>Thousands.</i>

730
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,362
<i>I have been gathering
human corpses for centuries,</i>

731
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,643
<i>each one a host for
the legions of demon spirits</i>

732
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,770
<i>I will now summon from hell!</i>

733
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,445
You will be the first.
You will be one of us.

734
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:49,042
And you will no longer be alone.

735
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,731
Your Majesty, the moment they
awake, they could be possessed!

736
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,931
Destroy them. Destroy them all!

737
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,251
Welcome, my son.

738
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,922
You have possessed a truly remarkable body.

739
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,283
I am not your son.

740
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,444
And this body is mine.

741
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,728
No, it's not possible!

742
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,650
You have a soul!

743
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,441
Gideon...

744
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,001
I know.

745
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,849
Then, why did you save me?

746
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,282
Because you finally found
your higher purpose.

747
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,401
Where's the journal?

748
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,170
I don't need it anymore.

749
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,487
<i>We do not ask
for the lives we are given,</i>

750
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,611
<i>but each of us has the right
to defend that life.</i>

751
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,800
<i>I have fought to defend mine.</i>

752
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,920
<i>And when the forces of darkness return,</i>

753
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,568
<i>you shall know that I am out there</i>

754
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,807
<i>fighting to defend yours.</i>

755
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,687
<i>I, descender of the demon horde.</i>

756
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,804
<i>I, my father's son.</i>

757
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,651
<i>I...</i>

758
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,044
<i>Frankenstein.</i>
