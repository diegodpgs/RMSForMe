1
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:03,764
Forgive me, Consul Han...

2
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:06,892
but I believe
we can ill afford...

3
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:09,926
to lose men
of your high character.

4
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:12,337
And speaking as a friend...

5
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:15,865
who's fought side by side
with you for 15 years...

6
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,310
I will sorely miss
the unshakable support...

7
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:20,246
you've given
the Royal Hong Kong Police.

8
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:23,580
So, on behalf of all Brits...

9
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:25,882
who have ever carried the shield
in Hong Kong...

10
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,217
we shall miss you.

11
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:29,018
We wish you nothing
but happiness...

12
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,582
as you take up your new post
in the United States.

13
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:34,595
Ladies and gentlemen,
Consul Han.

14
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:37,430
Thank you, Thomas.

15
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:45,265
You know Thomas is not going
to make this evening easy.

16
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:46,466
Excuse me.

17
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:54,475
Commander Griffin...

18
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:57,177
I am pleased to be able
to leave you and Hong Kong...

19
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:59,448
with a special gift tonight.

20
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:02,047
Earlier this evening,
Detective Inspector Lee...

21
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,854
and his special task force
have once and for all...

22
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:06,655
crushed the Juntao
criminal organization...

23
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:08,594
and reclaimed artifacts...

24
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:11,223
from 5,000 years
of China's heritage.

25
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,335
Thank you.

26
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:19,405
This is the kind of legacy
I dreamt about.

27
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,598
Hong Kong forever.

28
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:24,167
To Hong Kong forever.

29
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:32,612
Soo Yung.

30
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,126
Stupid fool!

31
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,688
Get the hell out of my way!
Man, are you crazy?

32
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:17,857
Shoot!

33
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,127
You moron!

34
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:27,798
Clive, what's up, man?

35
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:29,969
You're late.

36
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:31,876
-I'm late?
-Yeah, you're late.

37
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:35,280
I've been waiting
in the back for over an hour.

38
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:37,876
-I was in the diner.
-I told you in the back.

39
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
Think I would do this shit
out front?

40
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:42,749
-I'm gonna get busted.
-You weren't in the diner.

41
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,156
I said in the back--
It don't even matter.

42
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:48,629
Let's do this.
What's that, a gun?

43
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,563
How many people
you killed this year?

44
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:53,158
Stop it, man.
Let's do it. Come on.

45
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,395
Don't be late again.

46
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:56,460
I ain't gonna be late.
What we got?

47
00:06:58,272 --> 00:06:59,933
That's tight.

48
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:02,670
That's beautiful. That's nice.
What's that?

49
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,804
-That's C-4.
-That's C-4?

50
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:08,145
-Oh, shit.
-What's the problem?

51
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:10,810
No problem. I been looking
everywhere for this shit.

52
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:14,447
How the hell you find some C-4?

53
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:16,719
The Iraqis
can't even get this shit.

54
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:18,418
Where'd you get this from?

55
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,721
it's a hot ticket.

56
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,853
You don't know how happy
you made me.

57
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:24,387
You got what I want.
Let me get that money.

58
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:25,694
Step away from the car.

59
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,894
Hey, officers.

60
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:30,802
Put your hands above your heads.
Just do it now.

61
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,864
Ain't no problem here.
Why y'all messing with us for?

62
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:35,808
All right, take it easy.

63
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:37,868
-You don't wanna do that.
-Yes, I do.

64
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:40,642
-No, he don't. He's playing.
-No, I ain't playing.

65
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:43,081
-Yes, he is, officer.
-I'm not playing!

66
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:44,243
Drop the gun!

67
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:46,082
He's just my cousin.
We're just talking.

68
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,587
Get in your car and leave.

69
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:48,987
We can't do that.

70
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:51,423
I'll blow his head
all over the parking lot!

71
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,824
Go away and buy some doughnuts!

72
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,259
See? You made him mad.

73
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,456
Let me talk to him.
All right?

74
00:07:57,465 --> 00:07:58,727
Don't move!

75
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:01,394
All right.
Everything's cool now.

76
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:04,666
He down. The gun's down.
Get back in the car and leave.

77
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:05,831
Hands on your head!

78
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:07,602
Everything's cool, officer.

79
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:08,836
Do it now!

80
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:29,793
Didn't I tell you?

81
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:53,311
Stop it! I got C-4 in the trunk!

82
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:22,876
Clive, guess what, man.

83
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,818
I forgot to tell you.
I'm LAPD.

84
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:27,218
You under arrest.

85
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:35,062
Soo Yung, come on,
we're gonna be late.

86
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,893
Let's go.

87
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:38,796
Excuse me.

88
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,926
What?

89
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:42,936
Telephone. China.

90
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,503
Soo Yung, I love you.
Have a nice day.

91
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:51,306
Will you be home after school?

92
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,281
I am going to pick you up
myself.

93
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:28,538
When you walk by every night...

94
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:30,709
talkin' sweet
and lookin' fine...

95
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:34,710
I become hectic inside.

96
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:37,724
Baby, I'm so into you.

97
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:40,249
Darlin', if you only knew...

98
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:43,457
all the things
that float through my mind.

99
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:06,481
Is there a problem, officer?

100
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,818
No problem.

101
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:10,323
Just rush hour.

102
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:07,539
Security's in place?

103
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:10,607
You're sure all of the exhibits
will be ready by this weekend?

104
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:13,916
Yes, sir. Your opening remarks
are scheduled for 7:30.

105
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:16,582
Excuse me, Consul Han.

106
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:20,219
I'm Warren Russ with the
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

107
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,252
This is Agent Whitney.

108
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:24,025
We need to speak with you
in private.

109
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:27,794
Excuse me.

110
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:38,001
I know this is a difficult time
for you, Consul...

111
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:40,445
but be assured
we'll get your daughter back.

112
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:42,142
But will you get her back alive?

113
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:45,641
We have the best agents
in the world on those streets.

114
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:49,779
I would like
one of my people to help.

115
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:53,783
Let me assure you, the FBI
considers this a top priority.

116
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:56,126
We have plenty of people
on the case.

117
00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:58,996
Mr. Russ, I am not an American.

118
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,092
My daughter is not an American.

119
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,397
I understand that, sir--

120
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:04,802
He's already on the plane.

121
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,273
I trust you will treat him
with the same courtesy...

122
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,276
as you have shown me.

123
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:14,914
Ten people
jumped out of the trunk.

124
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:17,816
I started handling all of them.
Throwing them everywhere.

125
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:19,820
Then two stupid cops
came out of nowhere...

126
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:21,822
messed everything up,
but then I regrouped.

127
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:23,323
I had to save their life.

128
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:25,484
It ain't in there.
Anyway, I save their life.

129
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:27,517
I start runnin',
trying to get the bomb--

130
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:30,257
I can't believe
you went without me.

131
00:13:30,297 --> 00:13:31,992
I'll talk to y'all later,
all right?

132
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,125
I'll tell you the best part
after work.

133
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:36,102
This is why nobody
wilI work with you...

134
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:39,401
why you're the only cop in the
department without a partner.

135
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,534
Johnson, look, first of all,
if you want a date with me...

136
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:45,170
you have to wait on the list
like every other woman, OK?

137
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:47,271
Second of all, I work alone.

138
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:50,374
I don't need no partner
and ain't never gonna have one.

139
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,783
-Did Kojak have a partner?
-Yeah. The fat guy.

140
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,981
He wasn't never with him.
Did Columbo?

141
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:56,990
Captain Diel ordered me
to go with you...

142
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:59,788
because you needed bomb squad
backup, but once again...

143
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:01,351
you screwed me and yourself.

144
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:03,056
Look, Johnson,
it's dangerous out there.

145
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:05,429
it's safer for you
to be behind the desk.

146
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:08,026
We were supposed to be
on the same team.

147
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:10,400
Team?
Johnson, this is the LAPD...

148
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:12,564
the most hated cops
in the free world.

149
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:14,267
My own mama ashamed of me.

150
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:16,139
She tell everybody
I'm a drug dealer.

151
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:17,939
This is a pit stop for me.

152
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:19,775
I'm on the verge of leaving
you suckers behind.

153
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:22,509
Actually, you're on the verge
of being suspended.

154
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:23,743
Have a nice day.

155
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:31,853
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

156
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:35,291
Quit playin', girl.

157
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:38,762
I know you playin'.

158
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:42,002
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

159
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:46,902
This is a problem.
That's all I need...

160
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:48,670
some foreigner
getting his head blown off...

161
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,370
and creating
an international incident.

162
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,641
What can we do?
He's on his way.

163
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:56,811
Call the field office.
Have them send over a rookie.

164
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,341
We'll have him escort this guy
around a few days...

165
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,820
pretend to follow some leads,
show him some sights...

166
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:03,254
keep him out of our way.

167
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,554
You want to do that
to one of men?

168
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:07,355
What do you suggest?

169
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:12,554
Well, as long as we're
gonna humiliate someone...

170
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,590
might as well be LAPD.

171
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:18,470
Even if I had an extra man...

172
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:21,133
who would want
such a bullshit assignment?

173
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,938
Well, it's a disgrace to me.

174
00:15:22,977 --> 00:15:24,911
it's a disgrace
to my department.

175
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:26,207
it's a disgrace to--

176
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:31,449
Dan, I'm sending someone
right over.

177
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:37,720
Captain, I know you read
the paper, but they lying.

178
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:39,191
I wouldn't do nothing like that.

179
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:42,024
You know how the paper is.
They just want a story.

180
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:44,895
Two officers were shot.
One man lost a pinkie.

181
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:46,229
But didn't nobody die.

182
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:49,064
-You destroyed half a block.
-That block was messed up.

183
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,571
-You lost lots of evidence.
-We got a little left.

184
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:54,665
What you did was dangerous
and completely against policy.

185
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,506
And not only that...

186
00:15:57,544 --> 00:15:59,239
you did a good job.

187
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:01,541
What?

188
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:03,777
Everyone around here
is so image-conscious.

189
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:06,308
Everybody's so afraid
of their own goddamn shadow.

190
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,548
it's nice to meet
an L.A. detective...

191
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:11,114
who's willing to lay it
on the line.

192
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:14,559
Captain,
that's the same way I feel.

193
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:16,495
That's what I've been trying
to tell everybody.

194
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,431
Every so often, we have to let
the general public know...

195
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:21,263
that we can still blow shit up.

196
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:24,327
You goddamn right.
That's the only way I work.

197
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,963
So that mean
I ain't gettin' suspended?

198
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:28,497
-Are you kidding?
-Don't know why I said that.

199
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,476
I just got a call from the FBI.

200
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,604
The 10-year-old daughter
of a Chinese diplomat...

201
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:35,774
was kidnapped this morning,
and they want you on the case.

202
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,113
FBI want me?

203
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:38,584
That's right.

204
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:40,746
-Stop lying.
-I don't lie.

205
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:42,483
-Tell the truth.
-I'm telling the truth.

206
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:45,591
Thank you, Captain.

207
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:48,789
Congratulations, Carter.
You are going to the show.

208
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:51,389
I'll look out for you
when I reach the top.

209
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:54,094
-I'm gonna make you mayor.
-I'd rather you didn't.

210
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:59,839
Hey, listen up!
If anybody need me...

211
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:03,775
I'm gonna be workin'
a big, big case for the FBI!

212
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:22,428
Yo. Take care of that for me.

213
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:40,303
I need one of those earpieces
immediately, all right?

214
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:41,746
Hey, how you doing?

215
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:44,615
I want the consul's personnel
records cross-checked...

216
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:47,119
with that new list
we received from lnterpol.

217
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:49,952
See if you can make
any matches or connections.

218
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,924
OK, boys, what have we got?

219
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,927
Have we checked the consul
personnel records yet?

220
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:56,395
I want to know
who's he been talking with.

221
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,057
OK, come on. Give me the story.

222
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:00,692
Any demands? Any fingerprints?
Have we interviewed his staff?

223
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:03,362
Whitney, who is this?

224
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:06,200
Give me a copy of that.

225
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,208
James Carter, FBI.

226
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:11,075
Warren, he's here
for the special assignment.

227
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,905
I'm Agent-ln-Charge Warren Russ.

228
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:18,440
it's good to have you onboard.

229
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:19,884
I waited a long time for this.

230
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,753
You guys sure take a long time
to process an application.

231
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:26,384
Well, Carter,
your particular assignment...

232
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:28,894
is considered G-14 classified.

233
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:34,367
Why don't you and I take a walk
and I'll fill you in?

234
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,663
OK, Warren.

235
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:43,234
G-14 classified.

236
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:44,904
That's good.

237
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:47,072
You don't understand.
This is my dream.

238
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:49,082
I'm very excited
about working with the FBI.

239
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:52,085
I'm glad.
Listen, his name is Lee.

240
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,747
And the director considers
this a top priority.

241
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:57,586
No disrespect, but he's only
gonna get in my way.

242
00:18:57,624 --> 00:18:59,091
I'm not used
to having a partner.

243
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:02,061
If I'm handling the situation,
I'm gonna have to work alone.

244
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:04,359
Carter, he is the situation.

245
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,026
Must be a misunderstanding.

246
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:10,230
I was sent down here for
the kidnapping. Little girl?

247
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,738
Forget the little girl.
Your assignment is Lee.

248
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:16,038
Who and what kind of assignment
is that?

249
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:19,534
Lee is a foreign detective
and a friend of the consul's.

250
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,209
it's your job to keep him out
of sight and away from danger.

251
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:27,546
Yeah, you want me to baby-sit,
but I don't do that.

252
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:29,556
I came down here
for the big assignment.

253
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,558
The truth is,
this is an FBI operation...

254
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:35,551
and I don't need help from LAPD
or some Chun-King cop.

255
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:37,063
You got it?

256
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:39,464
Whoa. Hold it.

257
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:41,990
Why not use your men
for this top-priority case?

258
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:44,401
What am I supposed to do,
take him to the zoo?

259
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:45,598
I don't give a damn.

260
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:48,437
I don't want to see him
or you till this is resolved.

261
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:50,909
Now, his plane arrives
in an hour.

262
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:53,572
We want to make
a good impression, Carter.

263
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:55,878
it's his first trip to America.

264
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:59,052
This is bullshit!

265
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:40,888
Please tell me
you speak English.

266
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:44,794
I'm Detective Carter!

267
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:47,231
Do you speaka any English?

268
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,563
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

269
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:02,538
I cannot believe this shit!

270
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:04,573
First,
I get a bullshit assignment...

271
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,449
now, Mr. Rice-A-Roni...

272
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:09,611
don't even speak American.

273
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,782
Come on. My ride's over here.

274
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:17,053
Put your bag in the back.

275
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:25,298
Put your bag in the back!

276
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:31,099
No. You put your own shit
in the back!

277
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:33,112
I am not a skycap.

278
00:21:33,146 --> 00:21:35,307
I'm FBI, you understand?

279
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:39,809
What the hell you think this is?

280
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:46,119
Captain, I don't think
this is funny.

281
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,127
No, I'm serious, Captain.
I ain't playin'.

282
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:50,095
Tell the FBI you made a mistake.

283
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,654
I can't do that, Carter.

284
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:55,691
I'm sure that you and Mr. Lee
will have a nice time together.

285
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:59,502
You better call the FBI or
I drop his ass at Panda Express.

286
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,702
Drop this case, you're suspended
for two months without pay.

287
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:05,837
Well, you can forget
about being mayor then.

288
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:07,574
Congratulations, Carter.

289
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:10,105
Looks like you finally
got yourself a partner.

290
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,351
One little pinkie get blowed off
and everybody trippin'.

291
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,051
Chinese consul?

292
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:23,426
That's one of the places
you can't go.

293
00:22:23,463 --> 00:22:25,260
I ain't getting fired.
You gonna pay my bills?

294
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:28,499
That's the little girl?

295
00:22:30,637 --> 00:22:32,229
Say something.

296
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,267
Y'alI think this is real funny.

297
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:38,607
Give Carter
the big G-14 classified case.

298
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:41,614
Gonna show the FBI they don't
know who they playing with.

299
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:43,548
I'll solve this case myself.

300
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,880
That's right.

301
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:58,123
But I wanna show you something
first. Look familiar?

302
00:22:58,165 --> 00:23:01,134
Just like home, ain't it?

303
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:04,569
I ain't never been to China,
but it probably look like this.

304
00:23:04,604 --> 00:23:06,003
Get your star maps!

305
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,599
Look, John Wayne.

306
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:11,236
You know John Wayne?

307
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,472
John Wayne.

308
00:23:12,512 --> 00:23:14,742
Yeah, John Wayne, man.
Hang out with the Duke.

309
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:16,248
I'll be right back.

310
00:23:16,283 --> 00:23:18,080
You might see
one of your cousins here.

311
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:20,848
Find them and stalk 'em !

312
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:22,081
Star maps!

313
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:24,090
Right here! Star maps!

314
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:25,421
Stucky.

315
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:29,259
You got the address
to Michael Jackson's house?

316
00:23:29,296 --> 00:23:31,764
You can't come around my job!
That's harassment!

317
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:33,026
I'm just checking up on you.

318
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:35,933
I'm fully legit now.
I'm selling star maps.

319
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:37,129
Yeah, legit my ass.

320
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,867
You and your Asian gang friends
know about a kidnapping?

321
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:42,374
I don't know nothing.

322
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:45,105
Give me one of them star maps...

323
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:47,079
for $45, you understand
what I'm saying?

324
00:23:47,113 --> 00:23:49,604
Don't know nothin'
about no kidnapping...

325
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:53,107
but this dude's buying firearms,
explosives, and people...

326
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:54,780
like he's gonna start a war.

327
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:56,789
What's his name?

328
00:23:56,823 --> 00:23:58,688
For $45, I don't know his name.

329
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:01,626
-You better tell me something.
-I don't know nothing for $45.

330
00:24:01,661 --> 00:24:02,753
Stucky, you don't--

331
00:24:04,264 --> 00:24:06,198
l didn't tell you nothin'!

332
00:24:49,943 --> 00:24:51,604
Didn't I tell you
to wait for me?

333
00:24:52,646 --> 00:24:54,614
What the hell you doing
on this bus?

334
00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:00,108
Think I'm playin' with you?

335
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:02,553
I ain't playin' with you.
Sit down.

336
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,216
OK. All right.

337
00:25:04,257 --> 00:25:05,884
it's OK.

338
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:08,190
it's all right. FBI.

339
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:11,320
Take a picture. it's OK.
Wait a minute.

340
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:20,266
All right.

341
00:25:20,307 --> 00:25:21,899
What?

342
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,273
Get out of my way!

343
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,578
FBI. Stop this bus.

344
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:42,617
Hey, look.

345
00:25:43,797 --> 00:25:46,766
Hey, kids, get back in here.
Sit down.

346
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:57,003
Stop! FBI!
l need this motorcycle.

347
00:25:57,043 --> 00:25:59,568
-No way, man.
-Get off!

348
00:26:24,938 --> 00:26:27,907
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

349
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:29,408
Where you think you're going?

350
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:31,376
Didn't I say
to stay by the Duke?

351
00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:33,003
What do you think you're doing?

352
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:35,446
Mind your own business.
Stay in the car.

353
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:37,074
Hey. What you doing?

354
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:39,642
I was trying to find out
where you was going.

355
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:41,085
You thought
I was gonna shoot you?

356
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:42,884
What's happening here?

357
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,591
Put the gun down.

358
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,525
I ain't playin' with you!

359
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,891
Think I'm playin' with you?

360
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:50,190
Don't move!

361
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:53,629
Drop your guns.

362
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:56,230
Hey, man.

363
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:58,100
Look. FBI.

364
00:26:58,138 --> 00:26:59,605
I'm policeman.

365
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:02,767
I'm just showing him how
to take a gun from a suspect.

366
00:27:04,544 --> 00:27:06,478
All of a sudden
you speaking English?

367
00:27:06,513 --> 00:27:07,639
A little.

368
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:09,046
My ass. You lied to me.

369
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:11,050
l didn't say I didn't.
You assumed so.

370
00:27:11,084 --> 00:27:13,552
Assume I kick you little
Beijing ass right now.

371
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:15,053
Man, I ain't scared of you.

372
00:27:15,088 --> 00:27:16,555
l know you know
that tricky shit.

373
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:18,853
I'm not responsible
for your assumptions.

374
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:21,486
You full of shit,
you understand that?

375
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:24,895
Not being able to speak
is not the same as not speaking.

376
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:26,922
You seem as if you like to talk.

377
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:28,831
I let people talk
who like to talk.

378
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:32,531
It makes it easier to find out
how full of shit they are.

379
00:27:33,606 --> 00:27:35,597
What the hell did you just say?

380
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:37,507
I like people to talk...

381
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:40,572
So I'm the one full of shit?

382
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:42,080
We both full of shit.

383
00:27:42,115 --> 00:27:43,605
You full of shit.

384
00:27:45,952 --> 00:27:47,385
I'm gonna kick your ass.

385
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:50,184
Don't nobody do that but me.

386
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:53,285
You want me to kick your ass,
don't you?

387
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:00,591
You must take me to see
Consul Han right away.

388
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:04,091
Just sit there and shut up.
This ain't no democracy.

389
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:08,036
-Yes, it is.
-No, it ain't.

390
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:11,043
This is the United States
of James Carter now.

391
00:28:11,077 --> 00:28:14,205
I'm the president,
I'm the emperor, I'm the king.

392
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:16,112
I'm Michael Jackson, you Tito.

393
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:18,117
Your ass belong to me.

394
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:20,551
Why would they not want my help?

395
00:28:20,587 --> 00:28:22,555
'Cause they don't give a damn
about you.

396
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:24,853
They don't like you.
I don't like you.

397
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:27,052
I don't care.
I'm here for the girl.

398
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:29,653
The girI don't like you.
Nobody likes you.

399
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:32,062
You came all the way
over here for nothing.

400
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:33,963
You ain't gonna be--

401
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,230
Beach Boys.

402
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:38,066
Oh, hell, no.

403
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:39,662
You didn't just touch
my goddamn radio.

404
00:28:39,706 --> 00:28:42,072
The Beach Boys
are great American music.

405
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:44,576
The Beach Boys'll get you
a great ass-whoopin'.

406
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:46,909
Don't you ever touch
a black man's radio, boy.

407
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:48,573
You can do that in China...

408
00:28:48,615 --> 00:28:51,083
but you'll get your ass
killed out here.

409
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:53,108
Let me show you real music.

410
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:56,612
That's real music.
You hear that?

411
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:11,026
Now can you do that
to the Beach Boys?

412
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,560
Hell no!

413
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:29,054
l must get to the consulate.
What are we doing here?

414
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:32,057
it's called a shakedown.
Very serious police work.

415
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:35,117
Just watch me handle my business
and patrol this place.

416
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:36,958
I want to help
with the investigation.

417
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:38,429
This is my case.

418
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:43,398
Your case?
Look, you can back me up.

419
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:47,930
When we get in here,
follow my lead and do what I do.

420
00:29:54,113 --> 00:29:55,580
What's up, my nigger?

421
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:56,604
What's up?

422
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:00,214
ls this weed?

423
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:01,413
What?

424
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,791
You got a prescription for this?
Where is it?

425
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:10,261
Where is it?

426
00:30:10,296 --> 00:30:11,422
Where?

427
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:12,795
Where?

428
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,195
Where? Where?

429
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:18,727
-l should take your ass to jail.
-For what?

430
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:19,897
For what? Look at this!

431
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:22,499
-That's nothing but a cigarette.
-This ciga-weed!

432
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:23,804
Well, it look like cigarette.

433
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:25,834
-You better have glaucoma.
-I do.

434
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:32,648
What's up, my nigger?

435
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:37,452
Hey, check that, baby.

436
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:46,393
What's happening, Carter?

437
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:49,731
Put the guns down!

438
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:52,966
M.C. Hammer there,
put the goddamn gun down.

439
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:55,133
Now, I got some questions,
and I need some answers.

440
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:56,402
Put 'em down.

441
00:30:56,442 --> 00:30:58,967
Where the girl?
The little girl.

442
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:01,037
-What little girl?
-The little Chinese girl.

443
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,775
I don't know nothin'
about no Chinese girl.

444
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:04,612
Don't act like you don't know.

445
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:06,448
I'll take your asses in
if I don't get answers.

446
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:08,044
Carter, put the gun down.

447
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:11,215
Don't act like you know me.
You don't know me.

448
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:12,588
l see what's going on here.

449
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,593
Y'all trying to play me
like a fool.

450
00:31:14,627 --> 00:31:16,754
Lee, go outside real quick.

451
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:18,593
it's gonna get
a little dangerous in here.

452
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:19,757
l may have ques--

453
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,596
Lee, go and wait by the bar.

454
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:24,102
Remember what I told you?
Back me up.

455
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,434
I'll take care of everything.

456
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:26,597
You're sure?

457
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:28,106
I'm sure. Go on now.

458
00:31:28,141 --> 00:31:29,938
Go on!

459
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:31,466
Think I'm playing?

460
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:33,138
Hurry up!

461
00:31:39,152 --> 00:31:40,312
Come here.

462
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:43,117
Don't come in my business
scaring me like that.

463
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:45,124
I was just playin'.
Man, give me a hug.

464
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:47,285
Just schoolin' the rookie,
showing him the ropes.

465
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:49,022
Why you didn't
come to church Sunday?

466
00:31:49,062 --> 00:31:51,622
l had some things
to take care of.

467
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:53,598
But I made the night service.

468
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:56,124
Yeah. Come here,
l wanna holler at you.

469
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:57,295
What's up?

470
00:31:57,337 --> 00:32:00,932
Who's this guy buying up
these explosives and weapons?

471
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,566
I don't know nothing
about that.

472
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:05,338
Luke, I know what you do.

473
00:32:05,378 --> 00:32:07,573
The only reason
why I ain't busted your ass...

474
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:10,013
'cause you my cousin,
and it'd kill Aunt Bootsy.

475
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:13,085
Why you gonna put
Aunt Bootsy in this?

476
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,416
Luke, I ain't playin'.

477
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:18,185
l know she got a bad heart,
but I will bust your ass.

478
00:32:18,224 --> 00:32:19,782
Tell me something.

479
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:26,087
The word down in Chinatown is
there's this new dude in town.

480
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:30,228
Bad-ass dude outta Hong Kong
buying up every goddamn thing.

481
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:31,167
What's his name?

482
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:33,297
Don't know.
He ain't buying shit from me.

483
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:35,432
-You don't know his name?
-No.

484
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:36,942
Don't nobody know his name.

485
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:46,781
What's up, my nigger?

486
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:49,754
What did you just say?

487
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:53,887
What's up, my nigger?

488
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,597
Come here!
You better watch your mouth!

489
00:33:09,776 --> 00:33:10,902
What you say, boy?

490
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:12,638
I don't want trouble.

491
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:03,492
Please...

492
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:05,258
I said I don't want trouble.

493
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,761
That's bad for you.

494
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:15,506
-Where the little girl at?
-What little girl?

495
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,736
You know what girl
I'm talking about.

496
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:20,746
Man, you better take
your goddamn hands off my suit.

497
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,577
Your mama bought me this
for Christmas.

498
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:24,446
This is my favorite suit.

499
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:27,915
I'll see you Thanksgiving.
Appreciate it.

500
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:30,081
Get your big
Happy-Meal ass over!

501
00:34:30,123 --> 00:34:31,590
Get over in the corner!

502
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:33,091
I'm still the law around here!

503
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,594
Next time I come here,
y'all better clean this up!

504
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:37,095
And brush your teeth!

505
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,119
Let's go.

506
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:45,536
-What are we doing here?
-I'm getting something to eat.

507
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:48,836
You want anything,
like a Cup O'Noodles?

508
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:52,971
Carter, stop wasting my time.
l made a promise to Soo Yung.

509
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:55,412
You're right.
l have been wasting your time.

510
00:34:55,448 --> 00:34:58,281
I'm sorry. Just let me
go get something to eat.

511
00:34:58,317 --> 00:35:00,581
When I come back out, I'll take
you wherever you want to go.

512
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:03,914
Shake on it?

513
00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:07,553
Hey, what are you doing?

514
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:10,426
You ain't the only one
with quick hands, are you?

515
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:12,090
I'll be right back.

516
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:22,131
Hey, man, I got you
a beef-and-bean burrito.

517
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:36,483
We have a taxicab approaching.

518
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:40,583
A man stepping out--Asian.
About 5'10".

519
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,423
We've got someone
approaching the gate.

520
00:35:42,461 --> 00:35:43,792
Dropped off by a cab.

521
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,290
Tell them to intercept.

522
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:50,495
lntercept.

523
00:35:50,536 --> 00:35:52,163
We will intercept.

524
00:35:57,643 --> 00:35:59,110
Can I help you?

525
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:01,909
-Yes. I must see the consul.
-About what?

526
00:36:01,948 --> 00:36:04,246
Please, it's very important.

527
00:36:04,283 --> 00:36:07,377
Why don't you tell us
why you need to see the consul?

528
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,910
We'll tell you
whether it's important.

529
00:36:08,955 --> 00:36:11,014
Do you have identification?

530
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:14,025
it's about his daughter
Soo Yung.

531
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,527
Hands above your head!

532
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:16,960
He asked about
the consul's daughter.

533
00:36:16,996 --> 00:36:18,122
He asked about the daughter.

534
00:36:18,164 --> 00:36:19,995
You don't understand.
I was invited.

535
00:36:25,104 --> 00:36:27,095
Don't move! Throw your gun away.

536
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:30,404
-He's gonna kill them.
-ls everything all right?

537
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:32,411
You'll be safer
on the second floor.

538
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:34,470
I'm sorry.

539
00:36:34,513 --> 00:36:36,310
I'm sorry about this.

540
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,097
He went over.

541
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:00,298
Let's go!

542
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:04,040
He's on the grounds! Come on!

543
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:36,071
Stay away from the window,
please.

544
00:37:36,108 --> 00:37:37,268
Right here.

545
00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:44,446
Get down! Now!

546
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:00,291
Don't move!

547
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,546
I think there has been
a misunderstanding.

548
00:38:16,582 --> 00:38:18,550
it's all right. it's OK.

549
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:21,280
it's him. The guy from China.

550
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,015
What?

551
00:38:23,055 --> 00:38:24,920
Come in, please.

552
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:33,794
Mr. Russ, I would like you
to meet Detective Inspector Lee.

553
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,698
Excuse me very much.

554
00:38:38,871 --> 00:38:40,099
Your gun.

555
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:46,938
Where the hell is Carter?

556
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,179
Then I gotta put up with this.

557
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:00,084
Seen a little Asian dude
about this height...

558
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:01,889
with a steering wheel
on his arm?

559
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:03,827
Go screw yourself.

560
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:05,763
What you say?

561
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:07,197
I said go screw yourself.

562
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:10,100
You take your sensitive ass
up there and let me in!

563
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:12,036
Don't make me get up
out of this truck!

564
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:13,333
Let this putz in.

565
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:15,863
Man, when I get up in here,
I'm slapping somebody.

566
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:18,042
What happened, Carter?

567
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:20,170
I ain't supposed to be
jumping on buses!

568
00:39:20,212 --> 00:39:23,045
I do not do that!
I am not Carl Lewis!

569
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:24,811
Who is this man?

570
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:27,051
Sir, I can explain.

571
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:29,554
Agent Carter has been helping
with my investigation.

572
00:39:29,588 --> 00:39:32,455
He's upset that we have not
done our job.

573
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:35,483
Me and Lee are taking care
of the situation.

574
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:37,723
We have everything
under control.

575
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:39,492
We'll get your daughter back
safe and sound.

576
00:39:39,532 --> 00:39:42,262
He is very passionate
about finding your daughter.

577
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:44,565
Well, I owe you my gratitude.

578
00:39:44,603 --> 00:39:48,061
We wanted Detective Lee to have
one of our best men by his side.

579
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:50,075
Agent Russ,
maybe this is a good time...

580
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:52,168
to tell him
the details of my assignment.

581
00:39:54,613 --> 00:39:56,581
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

582
00:39:56,615 --> 00:39:58,344
You wanna speak to me?
For a moment?

583
00:39:58,384 --> 00:39:59,612
In private?

584
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,749
Oh, I see!
This must be G-14 classified.

585
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,314
FBI-type stuff.

586
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:10,089
Let me call my captain
and let him know what going on.

587
00:40:10,129 --> 00:40:14,429
We'll talk in a second.
When a G-14 comes around.

588
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:15,627
Who's this? Hello?

589
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:17,693
Am I speaking with FBI?

590
00:40:17,736 --> 00:40:20,603
-Give me the phone.
-Yeah, this is the FBI.

591
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,368
You are FBI?

592
00:40:22,408 --> 00:40:24,103
Yeah, this is the FBI.

593
00:40:24,143 --> 00:40:27,601
If you want the girl back alive,
listen and do not talk.

594
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:29,136
OK, I'm listening.
Let me get a pen.

595
00:40:30,149 --> 00:40:31,616
All right. Cool.

596
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,949
The drop will be made tonight.
11:00 p.m.

597
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:37,478
The amount will be $50 million.

598
00:40:37,523 --> 00:40:39,115
Fifty million dollars?

599
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:41,854
Who you think you kidnapped,
Chelsea Clinton?

600
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:43,122
Keep him talking.

601
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:45,630
In used currency.
Nothing bigger than a 50.

602
00:40:45,664 --> 00:40:48,690
All right. Cool.
Fifty million. No problem.

603
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:51,965
I want 20 million in 50s...

604
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:53,494
Twenty million in 50s.

605
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:55,666
Twenty million in 20s...

606
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:57,175
Twenty million in 20s.

607
00:40:57,209 --> 00:40:59,302
And 10 million in 10s.

608
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:01,142
Ten million in 10s.

609
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,977
You want any fries with that?

610
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:04,414
What is your name?

611
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,180
You called us.
Why you want to know my name?

612
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:10,188
I just want to be able to tell
the consul who is responsible...

613
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:12,588
for his daughter's death
because he talk too much.

614
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,593
All right, hold up. Calm down.

615
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:17,061
I'm trying to hook you up.
I'm on your side.

616
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:19,087
You will receive instructions
for the drop...

617
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:22,100
half an hour
before it is to be made.

618
00:41:22,134 --> 00:41:25,228
If it is successful,
the girl will live.

619
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:27,102
I'm gonna make sure
you get the money...

620
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:29,107
and we can spend it
together when you do...

621
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:31,336
'cause I don't even
really work for them.

622
00:41:32,645 --> 00:41:35,341
We got it.
620 South Broadway. Downtown.

623
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:51,119
Team one, proceed down 6th
to 6th and Broadway.

624
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:54,621
Team two, I want you around
the back on 4th and Main.

625
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:56,134
Set up a perimeter.

626
00:41:56,168 --> 00:41:59,069
Take your team and cover
the building floor by floor...

627
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:00,833
all the way to the top. Move.

628
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:10,615
Two men around back.

629
00:42:10,649 --> 00:42:12,116
They must not go
into the building.

630
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:14,779
Yeah, you right.
Let's go tell them. Come on.

631
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,515
Take positions on the corner.

632
00:42:18,524 --> 00:42:21,152
Mr. Russ, you must pull
your men back.

633
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:23,093
What the hell
are you doing here?

634
00:42:23,128 --> 00:42:25,028
Where's Carter?

635
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,630
Please, listen to me.

636
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:32,136
You may be very competent,
but the mere fact...

637
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:35,231
that you know this girl
compromises your judgment.

638
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:44,110
Sir, if you were asking
for $50 million dollars...

639
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:45,844
would you be in a place
like that?

640
00:42:45,884 --> 00:42:48,011
Get this clown away from me.

641
00:42:48,053 --> 00:42:49,247
Take a hike!

642
00:42:58,864 --> 00:43:00,126
Hey, man.

643
00:43:00,165 --> 00:43:01,462
Why were you hiding?

644
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,058
What you talking about?
I wasn't hiding.

645
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:04,330
You were hiding.

646
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,361
l bent down to tie my shoe.

647
00:43:06,405 --> 00:43:08,396
Sir, the area is secured.

648
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:10,108
Room's empty.

649
00:43:10,142 --> 00:43:11,473
Damn it!

650
00:43:29,762 --> 00:43:31,195
Everybody pull back!

651
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,390
Goddamn!

652
00:43:32,431 --> 00:43:34,524
Get some paramedics
down here now!

653
00:43:34,566 --> 00:43:36,397
Evacuate the building
right away!

654
00:43:36,435 --> 00:43:37,902
Get fire crews here!

655
00:43:37,936 --> 00:43:40,734
We got an explosion
at 6th and Broadway.

656
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:46,096
That ain't far enough, man!

657
00:44:46,138 --> 00:44:49,130
I ain't Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!
Push it down some more!

658
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,495
Carter, don't come any--Stop!

659
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,405
What the hell you--

660
00:46:19,031 --> 00:46:21,261
I think I done broke my shit.

661
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,393
Who was that you was chasing?

662
00:46:23,435 --> 00:46:27,462
His name is Sang from Hong Kong.
Because of you he got away.

663
00:46:27,506 --> 00:46:29,770
Why you ain't tell me
about the bridge?

664
00:46:29,808 --> 00:46:32,208
-I did.
-No, you didn't.

665
00:46:32,244 --> 00:46:33,404
I said stop.

666
00:46:33,445 --> 00:46:35,072
I don't understand
what you be saying.

667
00:46:35,113 --> 00:46:36,740
What?

668
00:46:36,782 --> 00:46:39,512
You see what I'm saying?

669
00:46:39,551 --> 00:46:41,041
What's this in your hand?

670
00:46:41,086 --> 00:46:42,951
He dropped it.

671
00:46:42,988 --> 00:46:44,182
Oh, shit.

672
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,885
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

673
00:46:46,925 --> 00:46:48,290
I messed up my suit.

674
00:46:59,037 --> 00:47:00,766
Fifteen seconds.

675
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:08,706
Make a decision.

676
00:47:15,854 --> 00:47:17,185
Oh, shit!

677
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,019
Did I come at a bad time?

678
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:24,460
I got bad news for you, Johnson.
We're all dead.

679
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:26,361
I was distracted, sir.

680
00:47:26,398 --> 00:47:28,366
Distractions can occur
in the field.

681
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,300
That's why
we call this practice.

682
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:32,735
If you can't handle
the pressure, then quit.

683
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:33,965
Yes, sir.

684
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:36,804
Man, give her a break.
Don't worry about him.

685
00:47:36,842 --> 00:47:39,777
How you doing, girl?
Give me some love.

686
00:47:39,811 --> 00:47:41,438
Why are you tormenting me?

687
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,970
That any way to treat
an old friend?

688
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:46,143
I came to see how you was doing,
and I need some help.

689
00:47:46,184 --> 00:47:47,981
Help?

690
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,215
I know that you have
strong feelings for me...

691
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:52,052
but we gotta put that aside.

692
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,751
it's a little girl's life
at stake here.

693
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:56,226
Since when do care about anybody
but yourself?

694
00:47:56,261 --> 00:47:58,525
Please just take a look at this.

695
00:47:58,563 --> 00:48:01,396
We found this on a kidnapper.
Tell me what this is.

696
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:04,732
You want me to work with you?
I don't have time for this.

697
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,601
I got enough shit to deal with.

698
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,939
Who are you?

699
00:48:09,975 --> 00:48:12,500
-Sorry we got you in trouble.
-Yeah, he's sorry.

700
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:14,239
Tell me something
about this I don't know.

701
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:17,146
A remote. Could be nitro cap,
could be cross-delayed...

702
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:19,173
definitely not homemade,
definitely not American.

703
00:48:19,217 --> 00:48:22,550
It could open up a garage door,
or blow up some C-4.

704
00:48:22,587 --> 00:48:24,282
C-4?

705
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:25,847
Yeah, C-4.

706
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:30,250
This means so much to me.

707
00:48:31,763 --> 00:48:34,254
Hey, and I'm sorry about
spreading all those rumors...

708
00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:36,233
on Christmas about us
sleeping together.

709
00:48:36,268 --> 00:48:37,530
What?!

710
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:39,036
He's just joking.

711
00:48:46,345 --> 00:48:48,438
Hey, Bobby, what's up, man?

712
00:48:49,915 --> 00:48:53,442
-I need to see Clive Cod.
-No way, Carter.

713
00:48:53,485 --> 00:48:55,453
it's lights out.
They're locked down.

714
00:48:55,487 --> 00:48:56,613
You want me to lose my job?

715
00:48:56,655 --> 00:49:00,284
I got you this damn job.
You better let me in here.

716
00:49:00,325 --> 00:49:01,690
Can't do it.

717
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:04,355
Didn't I turn my back when
you bought that bag of weed?

718
00:49:04,396 --> 00:49:06,694
I was splitting it with you.

719
00:49:06,732 --> 00:49:08,165
Didn't I give you
the bigger half?

720
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,168
Do me this favor.

721
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,364
Shit. You got five minutes.

722
00:49:14,406 --> 00:49:16,203
Hey, Cod.

723
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:18,072
Your two brothers
are here to see you.

724
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:26,909
Clive, how you doing, man?

725
00:49:26,952 --> 00:49:29,011
You got a lot of balls,
coming here.

726
00:49:29,054 --> 00:49:32,046
I was just around the way.
Figured you would be bored.

727
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:34,320
l came to see how you was doing.

728
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:35,758
What the helI do you want?

729
00:49:35,794 --> 00:49:37,455
I just came to bring you a gift.

730
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:40,659
I know you got time to kill.
I brought you a toy.

731
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:42,530
-I don't want that.
-You don't?

732
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:44,592
Somebody told me
you like this stuff.

733
00:49:44,636 --> 00:49:47,662
I don't like stuff like that.
I don't even know what it is.

734
00:49:47,706 --> 00:49:49,196
You never sold this to nobody?

735
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:51,402
How could I,
when I don't know what it is?

736
00:49:51,443 --> 00:49:53,502
-Hold it.
-I don't want to hold it.

737
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:56,412
-Just touch it.
-I don't want to touch it.

738
00:49:56,448 --> 00:49:58,643
-You scared of it?
-You think I'm stupid?

739
00:49:58,683 --> 00:49:59,809
Stupid enough to get busted.

740
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:01,910
You want my fingerprints
so you can frame me.

741
00:50:01,953 --> 00:50:03,477
Why would I do something
like that?

742
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:05,080
Think I would try
tricking you again?

743
00:50:05,123 --> 00:50:06,715
I don't have to frame you.

744
00:50:06,758 --> 00:50:09,226
You'lI do life
for killing the little girl.

745
00:50:09,261 --> 00:50:10,888
I don't know anything
about a little girl.

746
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:13,762
That ain't
what I'll tell everybody.

747
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:15,460
I don't know anything.

748
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,831
I got a big mouth, Clive.

749
00:50:16,868 --> 00:50:18,028
Let me tell you something.

750
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,062
I don't know anything,
so you can kiss my fat ass.

751
00:50:21,106 --> 00:50:23,506
It'd take me all day
to kiss your fat ass.

752
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:25,237
You want some of this?

753
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:26,972
I'll give you all you want.

754
00:50:27,012 --> 00:50:28,570
Give me a name.

755
00:50:28,613 --> 00:50:30,376
I ain't telling you shit.

756
00:50:33,285 --> 00:50:34,912
She's only 11 years old.

757
00:50:34,953 --> 00:50:37,183
I don't want her to die.

758
00:50:37,222 --> 00:50:39,486
Look at the picture.

759
00:50:39,524 --> 00:50:41,617
I don't care about him or you.

760
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,890
l care about the little girl.

761
00:50:43,929 --> 00:50:46,124
Give me the name.

762
00:50:55,674 --> 00:50:57,835
The guy's name is Juntao.

763
00:50:57,876 --> 00:50:59,571
I never seen him.

764
00:50:59,611 --> 00:51:00,908
Where can I find him?

765
00:51:00,946 --> 00:51:02,880
Foo Chow Restaurant.
Chinatown.

766
00:51:02,914 --> 00:51:04,142
Foo Chow Restaurant?

767
00:51:04,182 --> 00:51:06,878
Get rid of this guy.
He'll get you killed.

768
00:51:06,918 --> 00:51:09,546
Clive, thank you, man.
I'm gonna come back.

769
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:11,920
I'm gonna bring your fat ass
some cookies.

770
00:51:30,575 --> 00:51:31,803
That's it right there.

771
00:51:36,715 --> 00:51:38,740
What are we waiting for?

772
00:51:38,783 --> 00:51:42,344
We scoping the place out, man.
Ain't gonna run up in there.

773
00:51:42,387 --> 00:51:44,548
That's how you get shot.

774
00:51:46,992 --> 00:51:48,323
I'm falling asleep.

775
00:52:02,307 --> 00:52:04,468
Hunh yeah.

776
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:06,875
What is it good for?

777
00:52:06,912 --> 00:52:08,436
Absolutely nothing.

778
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,947
Sing it again, you all.

779
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:13,473
War, hunh, yeah.

780
00:52:13,518 --> 00:52:15,452
What is it good for?

781
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,977
Absolutely nothing.

782
00:52:17,022 --> 00:52:18,614
Sing it again, you all.

783
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:21,854
War, hunh, yeah.

784
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:24,521
What is it good for?
Absolutely--

785
00:52:24,563 --> 00:52:26,758
You don't know nothing
about no war.

786
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:28,356
Everybody knows war.

787
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,391
Hunh, yeah.

788
00:52:30,435 --> 00:52:32,596
What is it good for?

789
00:52:32,637 --> 00:52:35,197
Absolutely nothing.

790
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,435
Good God, you all.

791
00:52:37,475 --> 00:52:39,807
It ain't you all, it's y'all.

792
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:45,812
Man, you sound
like a karate movie. Y'all!

793
00:52:46,952 --> 00:52:48,817
Say it from right here
with some soul. Y'all.

794
00:52:52,057 --> 00:52:54,525
Let me show your goofy ass
how to do this.

795
00:52:57,662 --> 00:52:59,459
What is it good for?

796
00:52:59,497 --> 00:53:01,124
Absolutely nothing.

797
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:02,497
Come on.

798
00:53:02,534 --> 00:53:06,061
War, hunh, yeah.

799
00:53:06,104 --> 00:53:08,072
What is it good for?

800
00:53:08,106 --> 00:53:09,835
Absolutely nothing.

801
00:53:09,874 --> 00:53:11,307
Listen to me.

802
00:53:11,343 --> 00:53:13,277
War, hunh.

803
00:53:17,115 --> 00:53:18,844
Come on, come on.

804
00:53:24,356 --> 00:53:25,584
Do that again.

805
00:53:25,624 --> 00:53:27,990
Do it again. Like this?

806
00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:18,703
One will be inserted
into the suitcase.

807
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:21,735
The other will be on you.
Now when you make the drop--

808
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:26,981
Do we have it?

809
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:28,508
All right, pick it up.

810
00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:32,156
You have what I asked for?

811
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,316
I do.

812
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:35,986
I hope now you realize
how serious I am.

813
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:37,654
Take the money to the alley...

814
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:40,187
behind the Foo Chow Restaurant
in Chinatown.

815
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:43,064
You have 29 minutes left.

816
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:59,911
Damn, Chen,
this is some greasy shit.

817
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:01,282
You ain't got no better food...

818
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:03,412
like some chicken wings,
some baby back ribs...

819
00:55:03,455 --> 00:55:05,184
some fries or something?

820
00:55:05,223 --> 00:55:07,623
Chinese food, no soul food here.

821
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:10,253
I didn't say soul food.
I said better food.

822
00:55:10,295 --> 00:55:11,455
I don't want that greasy shit.

823
00:55:11,496 --> 00:55:13,896
How you gonna sell
a big box of grease?

824
00:55:13,932 --> 00:55:15,126
I'm chilly a what?

825
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:17,691
Come on.

826
00:55:17,736 --> 00:55:18,964
I'm no punk bitch.

827
00:55:19,003 --> 00:55:20,402
I ain't no punk bitch neither.

828
00:55:20,438 --> 00:55:22,565
-I'm no punk bitch.
-I'll knock your hat off.

829
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:23,733
Come on.

830
00:55:23,775 --> 00:55:25,504
Man, what you got me eating?

831
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:26,805
That's eel.

832
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:28,073
Is it good?

833
00:55:28,113 --> 00:55:29,444
Very good.

834
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:31,244
What you got?

835
00:55:31,282 --> 00:55:32,613
Camel's hump.

836
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,912
What?

837
00:55:34,052 --> 00:55:35,952
Camel's hump.

838
00:55:42,627 --> 00:55:44,060
Kinda good.

839
00:55:44,095 --> 00:55:46,859
Need a little hot sauce,
but it's kinda good, though.

840
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:50,731
-We still waiting?
-Yeah.

841
00:55:52,837 --> 00:55:54,668
How we gonna get Juntao?

842
00:55:54,706 --> 00:55:57,197
How we know he exists?
Ain't nobody seen him.

843
00:55:57,242 --> 00:55:59,642
I know. He killed my partner.

844
00:56:01,613 --> 00:56:03,581
I'm sorry about that, man.

845
00:56:03,615 --> 00:56:05,606
That's one reason
I don't have no partner.

846
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,242
That's one thing
I learned from my daddy.

847
00:56:08,453 --> 00:56:09,715
Your daddy was a policeman?

848
00:56:09,754 --> 00:56:11,551
Fifteen years LAPD.

849
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:13,819
My father was also a policeman.

850
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:14,984
Your daddy was a cop?

851
00:56:15,026 --> 00:56:16,550
Not a cop, an officer.

852
00:56:16,594 --> 00:56:18,459
A legend all over Hong Kong.

853
00:56:18,496 --> 00:56:20,589
My daddy a legend, too.
All over America.

854
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:23,829
My daddy once arrested 15 people
in one night by himself.

855
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:25,768
My daddy arrest 25 by himself.

856
00:56:26,504 --> 00:56:28,335
My daddy
saved five crackheads...

857
00:56:28,373 --> 00:56:30,136
from a burning building
by himself.

858
00:56:30,175 --> 00:56:32,973
My daddy once caught a bullet
with his bare hands.

859
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:34,979
My daddy'll kick
your daddy's ass...

860
00:56:35,013 --> 00:56:36,674
all the way from here
to China...

861
00:56:36,714 --> 00:56:38,113
or Japan or wherever you from.

862
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:39,776
All up that Great Wall, too.

863
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:42,218
-Don't talk about my father.
-Don't talk about my daddy.

864
00:56:43,855 --> 00:56:46,415
Hey, that your boy?

865
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:47,948
Yes. Let's go.

866
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:52,895
I better go in first.
Ain't nobody gonna recognize me.

867
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:54,899
I'll wait five minutes.

868
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:57,434
Hey, you take my lD.

869
00:56:57,469 --> 00:57:00,905
If anything go wrong,
you bust in like you're LAPD.

870
00:57:05,577 --> 00:57:07,943
This won't work. I'm not 6'1".

871
00:57:07,979 --> 00:57:10,174
Yes, it wilI work.
it's all about attitude.

872
00:57:10,215 --> 00:57:11,705
Flip it open, flip it closed.

873
00:57:11,749 --> 00:57:13,808
Do it fast. Open, close. Fast.

874
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,287
You'll get it. Look.

875
00:57:17,322 --> 00:57:19,153
Take this.

876
00:57:23,261 --> 00:57:25,752
Hey, man, act like
you're from out of town.

877
00:57:25,797 --> 00:57:27,594
I am from out of town.

878
00:57:27,632 --> 00:57:29,896
Don't act like a cop.
Act like a tourist.

879
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:32,334
Don't be so obvious. All right.

880
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,065
OK, no problem.

881
00:57:35,106 --> 00:57:37,370
-Hi.
-How you doing?

882
00:57:37,408 --> 00:57:39,376
-For one?
-No, for two.

883
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,344
I'm here for a meeting
with Mr. Juntao.

884
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:44,439
I'm sorry,
I don't know Mr. Juntao.

885
00:57:44,482 --> 00:57:45,744
Maybe you don't understand.

886
00:57:45,783 --> 00:57:47,512
I'm Mr. Juntao's lawyer.
Legal advisor.

887
00:57:47,552 --> 00:57:51,682
He got into some shit again.
I'm a very busy man.

888
00:57:51,723 --> 00:57:53,156
I ain't got time
to be coming down here.

889
00:57:53,191 --> 00:57:55,751
My wife wants me to come home,
baby's shitting all over.

890
00:57:55,793 --> 00:57:57,226
Would you please get Mr. Juntao?

891
00:57:57,262 --> 00:57:59,753
But I have already told you
I don't know--

892
00:57:59,797 --> 00:58:01,560
You think I came here
for nothing?

893
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,032
You gonna give me gas money?

894
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:04,500
You got $5.00 on you?

895
00:58:04,536 --> 00:58:07,437
Would you please go tell
Mr. Juntao to get his ass here?

896
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,070
Thank you.

897
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:12,269
Can I sit right here?

898
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,175
Right here? Thank you.

899
00:58:16,948 --> 00:58:18,916
-Hi.
-Y'alI got any eel?

900
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,178
Sure.

901
00:58:20,218 --> 00:58:23,085
How's your camel hump?

902
00:58:24,556 --> 00:58:25,921
Excuse me?

903
00:58:25,957 --> 00:58:28,824
Where is Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles?

904
00:58:30,328 --> 00:58:32,922
This way?

905
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:36,229
I'm sorry.
I'm from out of town.

906
00:58:36,267 --> 00:58:38,531
Thank you.

907
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:40,504
Welcome.

908
00:58:40,538 --> 00:58:41,971
What's that?

909
00:59:22,847 --> 00:59:24,610
No, wait.

910
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:32,850
Get the girl out of here.

911
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:36,291
Make sure those two don't leave.

912
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:31,911
Juntao will see you.

913
01:00:31,949 --> 01:00:33,246
it's about time.

914
01:00:47,165 --> 01:00:48,462
Stop it!

915
01:00:48,499 --> 01:00:50,330
Let me go!

916
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:05,349
This is tight.
Ain't nothing like downstairs.

917
01:01:05,383 --> 01:01:06,907
Y'alI got it going--

918
01:01:07,952 --> 01:01:10,216
What's up, man?
What y'all watching?

919
01:01:15,993 --> 01:01:17,961
Where Juntao at?

920
01:01:21,466 --> 01:01:23,457
Why y'all so quiet?

921
01:01:28,773 --> 01:01:30,331
That was childish, man.

922
01:01:30,374 --> 01:01:32,069
That wasn't even called for!

923
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:35,477
Now I came down here
to see Juntao...

924
01:01:35,513 --> 01:01:37,242
'cause he told me
to come down here...

925
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:39,977
'cause I'm his half-brother
from Beijing.

926
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:43,418
Me and him got the same mama.
I'm Blackinese.

927
01:01:43,454 --> 01:01:45,979
We all the same. Whoa.
Wait a minute.

928
01:01:46,023 --> 01:01:47,718
OK, you gonna kill me?

929
01:01:47,759 --> 01:01:49,659
OK, put the gun down,
fight me like a man.

930
01:01:50,762 --> 01:01:53,060
That's right,
fight me like a man. Shit!

931
01:01:53,097 --> 01:01:56,589
Anybody can shoot somebody.
That's what I'm talking about.

932
01:01:56,634 --> 01:01:58,625
Back. Give me some room.

933
01:01:58,669 --> 01:02:00,466
You don't know
who you messing with.

934
01:02:00,505 --> 01:02:01,665
I'm gonna knock that yellow--

935
01:02:05,777 --> 01:02:07,540
Which one of y'all kicked me?

936
01:02:07,578 --> 01:02:09,341
Me.

937
01:02:11,749 --> 01:02:14,217
OK. All right.

938
01:02:25,363 --> 01:02:26,921
Hold on. Let's talk about this.

939
01:02:26,964 --> 01:02:29,626
Let's talk about this, man.

940
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,692
No, no. What that mean?

941
01:02:31,736 --> 01:02:33,033
Hey, man,
this is a misunderstanding.

942
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:34,628
Come on, let's pray about this.

943
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:38,206
FBI, huh?

944
01:02:38,242 --> 01:02:39,709
No, I ain't FBI.

945
01:02:39,744 --> 01:02:42,042
I'm a security guard,
I work at the mall.

946
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,603
Now wipe yourself off.

947
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:46,940
You're bleeding.

948
01:02:54,926 --> 01:02:56,689
Oh, hell naw.

949
01:02:56,727 --> 01:02:58,922
He just playing, man.
He ain't mean that.

950
01:02:58,963 --> 01:03:00,760
He meant cut me loose.
Let me go.

951
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:02,493
No, no!

952
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:03,693
LAPD.

953
01:03:14,812 --> 01:03:16,245
What you doing?

954
01:03:59,123 --> 01:04:00,283
Watch out!

955
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,684
Behind you.

956
01:04:10,468 --> 01:04:12,436
Freeze!

957
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:14,529
We kicked y'all ass.

958
01:04:14,572 --> 01:04:16,096
All y'all.

959
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,801
Y'alI got your ass kicked.

960
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:24,774
Oh, shit.

961
01:04:28,019 --> 01:04:29,316
Hey, man!

962
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:37,692
I'm gonna kill your ass.

963
01:05:05,022 --> 01:05:06,785
Lee! Over here, man!

964
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:08,348
Move! Move!

965
01:05:22,606 --> 01:05:24,096
Is that my gun?

966
01:05:25,943 --> 01:05:28,002
-It is my gun.
-Let's go.

967
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:35,348
Why you gotta drop
the goddamn badge?

968
01:05:35,386 --> 01:05:37,513
Then you threw the gun
out the window.

969
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:40,888
Come on, this way.

970
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:51,997
I got everything under control.
Don't worry about nothing.

971
01:05:52,036 --> 01:05:54,504
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

972
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:55,698
it's cool.

973
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,935
Why am I not surprised
to find you here, Carter?

974
01:05:57,975 --> 01:06:02,105
Dan, I want these two back
at the consulate immediately.

975
01:06:04,015 --> 01:06:05,778
Let's take a ride, gentlemen.

976
01:06:21,165 --> 01:06:24,760
You better get your hand off me.
Hey, man, he with me.

977
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:33,575
Just let me explain.
I'll start from the top.

978
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:36,079
We were making the drop.
Han was about to get her back...

979
01:06:36,113 --> 01:06:37,978
and you two screwed it up.

980
01:06:38,015 --> 01:06:40,575
What you talking about?
Didn't you hear what Lee said?

981
01:06:40,618 --> 01:06:43,451
Mr. Lee is on his way
to Hong Kong.

982
01:06:43,487 --> 01:06:45,478
Now get out of here
before I file...

983
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:47,684
obstruction of justice charges
against you.

984
01:06:47,725 --> 01:06:49,989
We was about to solve the case.
All we need to do--

985
01:06:50,027 --> 01:06:52,723
You're no longer
on this assignment, Carter.

986
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:54,287
Case closed.

987
01:07:11,382 --> 01:07:14,010
-Consul Han!
-Sorry, sir.

988
01:07:16,587 --> 01:07:18,316
It was all my fault.

989
01:07:18,355 --> 01:07:20,687
Lee would never do anything to
jeopardize your daughter's life.

990
01:07:20,724 --> 01:07:22,351
He loves your daughter.

991
01:07:22,393 --> 01:07:25,590
it's a little too late
for apologies.

992
01:07:26,797 --> 01:07:30,289
Consul...you have a call.

993
01:07:30,334 --> 01:07:31,961
We're ready.

994
01:07:32,002 --> 01:07:34,436
OK, pick it up.

995
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:41,737
The ransom is now 70 million.
I will call with instructions.

996
01:07:41,779 --> 01:07:44,771
You deliver the money or pick up
the body of your daughter.

997
01:07:44,815 --> 01:07:48,216
Please. You must understand.
What happened tonight was not--

998
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:57,950
Soo Yung, please tell them
l wilI do whatever--

999
01:08:21,285 --> 01:08:24,049
Sorry, man.

1000
01:08:24,088 --> 01:08:26,079
Be sorry for Soo Yung.

1001
01:08:51,115 --> 01:08:53,310
No hard leads.

1002
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:54,510
None.

1003
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,251
Listen, we're doing
all we can here, all right?

1004
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:02,851
Tracing everything that's coming
into this compound.

1005
01:09:02,893 --> 01:09:05,191
Excuse me, Consul.
You have a guest.

1006
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:07,390
Jack, let me get back to you.

1007
01:09:10,267 --> 01:09:11,427
Thomas.

1008
01:09:15,673 --> 01:09:17,231
I'm sorry, my friend.

1009
01:09:17,274 --> 01:09:19,606
I couldn't stand by
and do nothing.

1010
01:09:33,991 --> 01:09:35,618
Hey! What's up, baby?

1011
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,661
Man, you got guts calling me.
I'm gonna hang up.

1012
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:41,528
Hey, wait a minute.

1013
01:09:41,565 --> 01:09:43,396
Don't hang up.
Look, you know what?

1014
01:09:43,434 --> 01:09:46,267
You was right about me,
all right? I'm sorry.

1015
01:09:46,303 --> 01:09:48,396
-Are you on drugs?
-You was right.

1016
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:50,805
I was egotistic.
I was inconsiderate.

1017
01:09:50,841 --> 01:09:53,401
-I was self-centered.
-Yeah.

1018
01:09:53,444 --> 01:09:55,412
I ain't used to working
with partners...

1019
01:09:55,446 --> 01:09:57,573
but it ain't about me.
it's the little girl.

1020
01:09:57,615 --> 01:09:59,105
She gonna die without our help.

1021
01:09:59,149 --> 01:10:01,413
You understand what I'm saying?

1022
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:03,181
Not yet, but keep talking.

1023
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:06,587
I think something big going down
tonight, all right?

1024
01:10:06,624 --> 01:10:08,819
I need to know
where the consul's gonna be.

1025
01:10:08,859 --> 01:10:11,020
You think you can help me?

1026
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:13,029
I'll see what I can do.

1027
01:10:13,063 --> 01:10:15,793
No. I don't need you to see.
I need you to do it.

1028
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,630
Can you do it?

1029
01:10:19,036 --> 01:10:20,162
OK, Carter.

1030
01:10:20,204 --> 01:10:22,866
-All right, one other thing.
-Yeah?

1031
01:10:22,906 --> 01:10:24,897
What color panties you got on?

1032
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,913
Consul Han, I want you to go...

1033
01:10:34,952 --> 01:10:36,920
to the Chinese expo
as you planned.

1034
01:10:36,954 --> 01:10:39,286
Have the money
in the upstairs control room.

1035
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,291
Be sure to make no more mistake.

1036
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:43,657
I understand, but I want
to speak with my daughter!

1037
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:07,143
Excuse me, miss.
Who's the captain on this plane?

1038
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:09,948
Look, it don't even matter.
You need to go up there...

1039
01:11:09,987 --> 01:11:12,717
tell the captain we got
a problem on the left side.

1040
01:11:12,756 --> 01:11:15,190
Something wrong with the engine.
You need a new alternator.

1041
01:11:15,225 --> 01:11:17,159
My supervisor said,
'Willy, go on down there...

1042
01:11:17,194 --> 01:11:18,855
"and fix that plane.
Put the alternator on.

1043
01:11:18,896 --> 01:11:20,659
"Don't let it leave
till I come down there."

1044
01:11:20,698 --> 01:11:22,632
I suggest you tell
the proper authorities...

1045
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:25,362
not to move this plane
before the FAA comes here...

1046
01:11:25,402 --> 01:11:27,427
and we all in some shit. Go on!

1047
01:11:34,611 --> 01:11:36,476
What are you doing here?

1048
01:11:36,513 --> 01:11:38,947
Now get your ass up.
We got work to do.

1049
01:11:38,982 --> 01:11:41,075
Go away. I've disgraced myself.

1050
01:11:41,118 --> 01:11:42,847
Lee, what about the little girl?

1051
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:45,946
Leave me alone. A man like you
could never understand.

1052
01:11:45,989 --> 01:11:48,890
-A man like me?
-Devoted only to yourself.

1053
01:11:48,926 --> 01:11:50,917
You're ashamed of being
a police officer.

1054
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:52,485
You dishonor your father's name.

1055
01:11:52,529 --> 01:11:54,360
You don't know nothing
about my father.

1056
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:56,025
You say your father is a legend.

1057
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:58,000
My father was a legend.

1058
01:11:58,035 --> 01:12:00,265
He was killed making a routine
traffic stop in daylight...

1059
01:12:00,304 --> 01:12:02,204
by some punk
who didn't want no ticket...

1060
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:04,503
when his partner supposed
to get out of the car...

1061
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:05,940
and back him up, he didn't.

1062
01:12:05,976 --> 01:12:09,707
My father was as devoted as you,
and now he's dead.

1063
01:12:09,747 --> 01:12:12,716
And for what?
A traffic ticket and some punk?

1064
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,310
You tell me,
what's the honor in that?

1065
01:12:15,352 --> 01:12:17,320
You believe your father
wasted his life...

1066
01:12:17,354 --> 01:12:18,719
died for nothing?

1067
01:12:20,657 --> 01:12:22,124
Prove me wrong.

1068
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:28,553
For 15 years until China
resumed control of Hong Kong...

1069
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:32,467
Juntao was the most powerful
crime lord in Southeast Asia.

1070
01:12:32,503 --> 01:12:36,769
The British tried to close down
his operation, but we failed.

1071
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:38,934
But why the consul's daughter?

1072
01:12:38,976 --> 01:12:41,638
Detective Inspector Lee
helped me raid...

1073
01:12:41,678 --> 01:12:44,511
every known asset
of Juntao's operation.

1074
01:12:44,548 --> 01:12:47,642
We confiscated millions
in weapons and cash...

1075
01:12:47,684 --> 01:12:52,053
and a collection of Chinese art
unsurpassed in the world.

1076
01:12:52,089 --> 01:12:55,820
Then Juntao disappeared.
No witnesses.

1077
01:12:55,859 --> 01:12:58,828
Do you really think
he'll kill the girl?

1078
01:13:02,132 --> 01:13:06,694
My advice to you is...
pay the money.

1079
01:13:22,019 --> 01:13:24,988
Consul, I'm going upstairs
to make the drop.

1080
01:13:25,022 --> 01:13:28,287
I want you to remain calm
as if nothing's wrong...

1081
01:13:28,325 --> 01:13:31,385
and don't leave Agent Whitney's
side even for a moment.

1082
01:13:31,428 --> 01:13:33,089
I understand.

1083
01:14:26,917 --> 01:14:29,249
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1084
01:14:29,286 --> 01:14:31,254
I'm am Consul Han.

1085
01:14:31,288 --> 01:14:33,916
On behalf of the People's
Republic of China...

1086
01:14:33,957 --> 01:14:35,288
thank you for coming.

1087
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:41,757
I am pleased to present...

1088
01:14:41,798 --> 01:14:44,392
5,000 years of Chinese history
and heritage...

1089
01:14:44,434 --> 01:14:46,868
a collection which,
until recently...

1090
01:14:46,904 --> 01:14:48,872
was thought to be lost forever.

1091
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:51,568
This some nice shit.

1092
01:14:51,608 --> 01:14:53,633
That Buddha'd go good
in my bathroom.

1093
01:14:53,677 --> 01:14:57,272
Hey. This is the history
of my country....

1094
01:14:57,314 --> 01:15:00,340
priceless pieces
of Chinese culture.

1095
01:15:00,384 --> 01:15:02,477
If anything gets damaged...

1096
01:15:02,519 --> 01:15:05,181
Ain't nothing gonna happen
to none of this stuff.

1097
01:15:05,222 --> 01:15:10,387
And now we can pass them on
to our children.

1098
01:15:19,069 --> 01:15:21,230
Pardon me.

1099
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:29,203
I seen that guy
at that Chinese restaurant.

1100
01:15:29,246 --> 01:15:32,545
Consul Han has been fighting flu
for the past few days...

1101
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:34,949
so perhaps I should finish
what he started.

1102
01:15:34,985 --> 01:15:38,216
The first thing we gotta do
is clear out this riffraff.

1103
01:15:38,255 --> 01:15:40,553
If anybody stay behind,
they got something to lose.

1104
01:15:40,591 --> 01:15:42,286
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.

1105
01:15:42,326 --> 01:15:45,557
...future between
our two countries.

1106
01:15:45,596 --> 01:15:47,188
The more we see
the differences...

1107
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:48,356
Hey!

1108
01:15:48,398 --> 01:15:49,524
And similarities--

1109
01:15:49,566 --> 01:15:51,158
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen!

1110
01:15:51,201 --> 01:15:52,327
Goddamn it.

1111
01:15:52,369 --> 01:15:53,996
I'm Detective Carter
from the LAPD!

1112
01:15:54,037 --> 01:15:56,437
Russ, we got Carter down here.

1113
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:58,270
What the hell's going on
down there?

1114
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:00,674
We have just received
a threat on the building.

1115
01:16:00,711 --> 01:16:02,770
We ask that you please exit
the building...

1116
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:06,510
as soon as possible,
and please do not panic.

1117
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:09,747
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get your shit and go out!

1118
01:16:09,786 --> 01:16:11,549
Get the hell out!
There's a bomb in the building!

1119
01:16:11,588 --> 01:16:14,648
I don't believe this.
Agents, hold your positions!

1120
01:16:14,691 --> 01:16:16,556
Everybody take care,
but hold your positions.

1121
01:16:16,593 --> 01:16:17,719
What's going on?

1122
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:19,285
Get your old ass
out the building!

1123
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:21,126
Lady, put the glass down
and get out of here!

1124
01:16:21,164 --> 01:16:25,567
Woman, the exit over there.
Gonna get your head blowed off!

1125
01:16:25,602 --> 01:16:27,229
Come on, come on!

1126
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:29,670
Titty, titty, titty.
Get them titties outta here.

1127
01:16:29,706 --> 01:16:30,900
Will somebody grab Carter?

1128
01:16:45,756 --> 01:16:49,248
Consul Han, six blocks of C-4
are wired to your daughter...

1129
01:16:49,292 --> 01:16:50,782
in a car outside.

1130
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:58,467
Before the changeover,
most of this exhibition...

1131
01:16:58,502 --> 01:17:01,630
was in the hands
of a single private collector...

1132
01:17:02,906 --> 01:17:04,168
Me.

1133
01:17:04,207 --> 01:17:08,109
I worked most of my life
to acquire and catalog...

1134
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:10,909
these priceless pieces
that you see before you.

1135
01:17:12,549 --> 01:17:15,109
And then, in one fell swoop...

1136
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:17,143
it was taken away from me.

1137
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:21,915
But tonight,
I shall be paid in full.

1138
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:25,018
Don't move!

1139
01:17:25,062 --> 01:17:27,496
She dies if I press this button.

1140
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:31,761
Just be patient.

1141
01:17:31,802 --> 01:17:34,464
My transportation
will be here shortly.

1142
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:39,706
Stay calm.

1143
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:54,320
I was just gonna tell you
you was in a red zone.

1144
01:17:54,357 --> 01:17:55,517
There's cops all over--

1145
01:17:58,829 --> 01:18:01,389
You didn't know I could do that.
Put your hands up!

1146
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:03,194
I ain't gonna kill you
this time.

1147
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:04,962
I'm just gonna kick your ass!

1148
01:18:08,839 --> 01:18:11,831
You tell your friends about me.

1149
01:18:23,587 --> 01:18:26,078
Hey, how you doing?

1150
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:27,590
We've been looking for you.

1151
01:18:27,624 --> 01:18:29,387
I'm Detective Carter
from the LAPD.

1152
01:18:29,426 --> 01:18:32,589
Everything is OK now.
I'll take you to your daddy.

1153
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:34,927
And first thing I'm gonna do
is take this vest off you.

1154
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:36,091
Don't touch it!

1155
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:37,930
I think it'll be safer
if we take it off.

1156
01:18:37,968 --> 01:18:41,335
No. I heard them say
it will explode.

1157
01:18:41,371 --> 01:18:44,306
I think it'll be safer
if we leave it on, OK?

1158
01:18:44,341 --> 01:18:45,865
Don't--don't move.

1159
01:18:45,909 --> 01:18:47,171
Where are you?

1160
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:53,775
Don't move!

1161
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:55,341
Hold your positions, goddamn it!

1162
01:18:55,385 --> 01:18:57,546
Do not draw your weapons.

1163
01:19:01,658 --> 01:19:03,523
Ladies and gentlemen...

1164
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,085
I think we'll call that
an evening.

1165
01:19:06,129 --> 01:19:08,654
Thank you and good night.

1166
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:36,485
I got something for you!

1167
01:19:37,828 --> 01:19:39,728
Got something you want.

1168
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:46,761
I got your bomb right here.

1169
01:19:52,108 --> 01:19:54,736
Want to blow something up?

1170
01:19:54,778 --> 01:19:56,075
Come on.

1171
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,475
Push the button. Come on.

1172
01:20:01,318 --> 01:20:02,444
Push the button.

1173
01:20:02,485 --> 01:20:05,386
-What are you doing?
-Play along.

1174
01:20:05,422 --> 01:20:07,083
Come on, push the button.

1175
01:20:07,123 --> 01:20:08,818
Yeah, come on, push the button.

1176
01:20:10,927 --> 01:20:12,053
Blow everybody up.

1177
01:20:12,095 --> 01:20:13,892
Yeah, blow everybody up!

1178
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:15,830
Push the goddamn button!

1179
01:20:17,601 --> 01:20:19,296
You heard what she said.

1180
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:24,672
You got everybody excited about
something being blowed up...

1181
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:26,175
and look at your
little punk British ass.

1182
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:28,109
Come on! Push the button!

1183
01:20:30,046 --> 01:20:31,172
Deal with it, please.

1184
01:20:31,214 --> 01:20:32,704
Where you going?

1185
01:20:40,023 --> 01:20:41,183
Cover the consul!

1186
01:20:43,627 --> 01:20:45,822
it's OK. She's a professional.

1187
01:20:45,862 --> 01:20:47,659
You must take the vest off.

1188
01:20:47,697 --> 01:20:51,030
Just give me a second.

1189
01:20:53,236 --> 01:20:55,033
There's a trigger on this vest.

1190
01:20:55,071 --> 01:20:57,403
It'll blow if I take it off.

1191
01:21:03,546 --> 01:21:05,138
Haven't you done this before?

1192
01:21:05,181 --> 01:21:07,672
it's a little different
in the practice room.

1193
01:21:07,717 --> 01:21:08,979
Everybody take cover.

1194
01:21:09,019 --> 01:21:11,681
We need more men down here.

1195
01:21:11,721 --> 01:21:14,417
Say again. Dan, do you read--

1196
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:29,395
Need some help down here,
damn it!

1197
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:38,546
Roses are red...

1198
01:21:38,581 --> 01:21:41,106
violets are blue.

1199
01:21:42,352 --> 01:21:44,343
Sugar is sweet...

1200
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:48,282
and so are you.

1201
01:21:56,499 --> 01:21:59,991
The remote can still set it off.

1202
01:22:00,036 --> 01:22:01,936
Get rid of it.

1203
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:09,403
-She OK?
-Yes.

1204
01:22:11,214 --> 01:22:13,580
I know that ain't the bomb!

1205
01:22:14,617 --> 01:22:16,380
Get that bomb away from me!

1206
01:22:16,419 --> 01:22:19,582
Take the bomb outside!

1207
01:22:21,658 --> 01:22:24,024
Yeah, take it over to Juntao.

1208
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,290
You go that way,
I go that way. Go!

1209
01:22:33,269 --> 01:22:34,736
Don't shoot!

1210
01:23:42,772 --> 01:23:44,000
Shit!

1211
01:24:01,157 --> 01:24:02,488
Where are you going?

1212
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:25,144
Meet me on the roof.

1213
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:27,809
Roger.

1214
01:24:49,405 --> 01:24:50,929
Don't move, man!

1215
01:24:50,974 --> 01:24:55,911
Yeah, I been looking for your
sweet-and-sour chicken ass.

1216
01:24:55,945 --> 01:24:59,278
Your boys ain't here now.
You all alone.

1217
01:24:59,315 --> 01:25:01,374
I kill him.

1218
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:03,977
Go ahead. I don't even like him.

1219
01:25:08,391 --> 01:25:10,484
Put your gun down.

1220
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,995
Fight like a man.

1221
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:14,428
What you say?

1222
01:25:14,464 --> 01:25:15,954
Fight like a man.

1223
01:25:17,133 --> 01:25:18,498
Fight like a man?

1224
01:25:20,336 --> 01:25:22,463
All right,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1225
01:25:22,505 --> 01:25:24,905
Then I'm gonna
take your ass to jail.

1226
01:25:24,941 --> 01:25:29,105
All right, come on,
put the gun down...

1227
01:25:29,145 --> 01:25:30,476
same time.

1228
01:25:54,337 --> 01:25:57,534
Wipe yourself off, man.
You're dead.

1229
01:27:09,078 --> 01:27:10,375
Thank you, God.

1230
01:27:36,339 --> 01:27:37,499
Oh, shit.

1231
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:01,288
You know he dead.

1232
01:28:03,366 --> 01:28:05,926
Help! Do something!

1233
01:28:05,968 --> 01:28:08,630
Hey, be cool, man!

1234
01:28:08,671 --> 01:28:10,138
Hang on!

1235
01:28:14,477 --> 01:28:16,707
l can't hold on anymore!

1236
01:28:16,746 --> 01:28:19,715
Hang on for about an hour.
I'm gonna get the ambulance.

1237
01:28:19,749 --> 01:28:22,513
-What are you doing?
-I'll be right back.

1238
01:28:22,552 --> 01:28:24,952
-Carter!
-I was just playing.

1239
01:28:29,826 --> 01:28:31,316
Do something!

1240
01:28:35,064 --> 01:28:36,793
I can't hold on anymore!

1241
01:28:55,718 --> 01:28:56,946
Oh, shit!

1242
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,624
Thank you! Thank you!

1243
01:29:04,127 --> 01:29:07,654
-What the hell you doing?
-I was just being polite.

1244
01:29:07,697 --> 01:29:10,325
Well, next time,
be polite to my nuts.

1245
01:29:10,366 --> 01:29:12,334
I'm sorry.

1246
01:29:12,368 --> 01:29:14,336
Thank you.

1247
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:16,031
Shit!

1248
01:29:27,884 --> 01:29:29,351
Are you all right?

1249
01:29:29,385 --> 01:29:30,750
I'm fine.

1250
01:29:31,821 --> 01:29:35,655
-I owe you everything.
-Only your friendship.

1251
01:29:39,562 --> 01:29:42,463
Look who's here.

1252
01:29:42,498 --> 01:29:44,466
What took you so long?

1253
01:29:49,405 --> 01:29:51,896
I think this belongs to you.

1254
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:05,082
I think you should come with me.

1255
01:30:05,121 --> 01:30:07,282
Get on the plane
when you get off work.

1256
01:30:07,323 --> 01:30:09,291
You fly for free.

1257
01:30:09,325 --> 01:30:10,883
I'm just trying
to expand my horizons.

1258
01:30:10,927 --> 01:30:14,055
Travel a little bit.
See the world.

1259
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:22,302
I'm through with y'all, man.
I'm going on vacation.

1260
01:30:22,338 --> 01:30:25,398
Now, hold on there.
We were just coming by...

1261
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:27,409
to tell you what a great job
you did yesterday.

1262
01:30:27,443 --> 01:30:29,434
And when you come back...

1263
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:31,811
there's gonna be
an FBI badge waiting for you.

1264
01:30:33,082 --> 01:30:34,515
You serious?

1265
01:30:35,952 --> 01:30:38,216
-Come on, don't be playing.
-No.

1266
01:30:38,254 --> 01:30:41,280
I don't know what to say.
it's like a dream come true.

1267
01:30:42,492 --> 01:30:45,484
I got an idea, though.

1268
01:30:45,528 --> 01:30:49,726
Why don't y'all
take that badge...

1269
01:30:49,765 --> 01:30:51,699
and shove it up your ass?

1270
01:30:51,734 --> 01:30:55,170
All up in your ass. I'm LAPD.

1271
01:30:58,574 --> 01:30:59,905
Bitch.

1272
01:31:02,411 --> 01:31:05,380
First class. I like this.
This is tight.

1273
01:31:05,414 --> 01:31:06,813
Can I take your jacket, sir?

1274
01:31:06,849 --> 01:31:09,818
My jacket? No.
You can take this bag, though.

1275
01:31:09,852 --> 01:31:11,820
How you doing? What's up?

1276
01:31:11,854 --> 01:31:13,321
What's up, man?

1277
01:31:13,356 --> 01:31:14,823
-You ready to go?
-Yep.

1278
01:31:14,857 --> 01:31:16,347
May I offer you some peanuts?

1279
01:31:22,131 --> 01:31:24,429
You never told me
you spoke Chinese.

1280
01:31:24,467 --> 01:31:27,925
I never told you I didn't.
You assumed I didn't.

1281
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:30,996
This is cool. Han's letting me
go to Hong Kong with you.

1282
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,270
I ain't been on no vacation
in five years?

1283
01:31:33,309 --> 01:31:36,403
We can hang in my crib.
I will show you my hood.

1284
01:31:36,445 --> 01:31:38,777
No, you can show me a couple
of them Chinese girls.

1285
01:31:38,814 --> 01:31:41,282
I want a massage.
I'm gonna get buck wild.

1286
01:31:41,317 --> 01:31:45,754
No police work for two weeks?
How long this flight?

1287
01:31:45,788 --> 01:31:48,450
-Fifteen hours.
-Fifteen hours?

1288
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:50,823
What are we gonna do
for 15 hours?

1289
01:31:57,333 --> 01:31:58,459
War...

1290
01:31:58,501 --> 01:32:01,732
Oh, hell, no! Stewardess!

1291
01:32:01,771 --> 01:32:02,669
What is it good for?

1292
01:32:02,705 --> 01:32:03,899
Stewardess, get me another seat!

1293
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:06,500

1294
01:32:06,542 --> 01:32:07,736
Stewardess!

1295

It broke.

1297
01:32:25,795 --> 01:32:27,956
Don't move! Don't smile!

1298
01:32:41,811 --> 01:32:44,678
What is this shit

1299
01:32:44,714 --> 01:32:45,840
Fifty million dollars?

01:32:45,881 --> 01:32:47,746

1301
01:32:47,783 --> 01:32:48,909
Fifty million dollars?

1302
01:32:48,951 --> 01:32:51,511
Who you think you got,

1303
01:32:51,554 --> 01:32:52,680

1307
01:32:57,593 --> 01:32:58,855

01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:04,959
Fifty million dollars?

1311
01:33:05,001 --> 01:33:07,060
Who you think you got,

1312
01:33:07,103 --> 01:33:08,400
Keep him talking--

1313
01:33:08,437 --> 01:33:10,405
Cut! Go back to the beginning.

1314
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:12,634
Was that it, Chelsea--
Did I get it?

1315
01:33:16,512 --> 01:33:17,672
Action!

1316

You know that other stuff,
but don't know his name?

1321
01:33:53,983 --> 01:33:56,975
Man, people tell me shit.

1322
01:33:58,988 --> 01:34:00,387
What's wrong with you?

1323
01:34:02,958 --> 01:34:05,392

1326
01:34:08,497 --> 01:34:12,058
My daddy one caught a bullet
by his bare hand.

1327
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:13,762
No bullshit.

1328
01:34:15,171 --> 01:34:17,139
What's the honor in that?

1329
01:34:17,173 --> 01:34:20,165
You believe your father
wasting his life...

1330
01:34:23,345 --> 01:34:25,313
They must not--

1331
01:34:25,347 --> 01:34:27,338
You're right, man.
Let's go tell them.

1332
01:34:28,851 --> 01:34:30,148
Anything goes wrong...

1333
01:34:30,186 --> 01:34:34,145

01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:35,953
He cannot speak English.

1335
01:34:35,991 --> 01:34:39,950
Man, this is cool.
Han sending us to Hong Kong.

1336
01:34:39,995 --> 01:34:41,519
What's that line?

1337
01:34:43,299 --> 01:34:45,290
May I offer you some peanuts?

1338
01:34:59,982 --> 01:35:03,543
See, how difficult is that?
My English?

1339
01:35:03,586 --> 01:35:06,714
He even cannot say three words,
Chinese.

1340
01:35:06,756 --> 01:35:08,087
You need some lunch?

1341
01:35:08,124 --> 01:35:10,092
I got it before, Jackie.

1342
01:35:10,126 --> 01:35:13,027
See? Now you know
how difficult I am.

1343
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:15,663
Look at Jackie.
