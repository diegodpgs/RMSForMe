1
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:04,256
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

2
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,285
Mr. Wilson.

3
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:39,896
Mr. Wilson?

4
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,631
Mr. Wilson?

5
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:52,836
Poor old Mr. Wilson must be so sick.

6
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,176
No wonder he ain't up.

7
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:05,583
Wow!

8
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,359
His heart sounds like our washing machine!

9
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,426
Oh, no.

10
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:19,865
He's growing extra skin.

11
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:46,653
His tongue's very ugly...

12
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:49,432
...and blue and spotty.

13
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:54,863
CooI!

14
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:02,404
He feels warm.

15
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:04,711
He has a temperature.

16
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:07,080
I know what you need.

17
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:09,017
You need an aspirin.

18
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:33,592
Don't you ever come back!
Do you hear me?

19
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:34,864
Never!

20
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:38,799
Starting part time will give you a chance
to ease back into it.

21
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:41,868
I mean, managing shopping malls
can't be much more difficult...

22
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:43,538
...than managing Dennis.

23
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:45,943
Where have you been?

24
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:47,506
Dennis?

25
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:49,775
Dennis?

26
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:52,648
I was at Mr. Wilson's house.

27
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:54,921
And, boy, is he sick.

28
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,787
He's got a fever, and he's burning up.

29
00:06:58,262 --> 00:06:59,889
I better call Martha.

30
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:02,524
You didn't bother him, did you?

31
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,993
No, but I gave him an aspirin.

32
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:07,902
And he don't like them any better than me.

33
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:12,009
You shouldn't visit people
so early in the morning.

34
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,307
That's the only time I know for sure
they'll be home.

35
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,108
Hello, George. Alice Mitchell.

36
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:19,342
Are you feeling all right?
Dennis said that you-

37
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,384
<i>Feeling all right!</i>

38
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:24,615
<i>Your son just shot an aspirin
down my throat with a slingshot!</i>

39
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,088
I'm very sorry.

40
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:27,522
<i>You better talk to him!</i>

41
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:28,923
We'll talk to him.

42
00:07:28,993 --> 00:07:31,826
<i>When I was a child,
none of this would have been tolerated!</i>

43
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,654
'Bye. 'Bye.

44
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,263
Hi.

45
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:46,443
Did you shoot an aspirin
into Mr. Wilson's mouth?

46
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:49,969
I didn't want him to bite off my fingers
with his big, fake teeth.

47
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,947
Those things are sharp!

48
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:56,485
George said Dennis shot an aspirin
into his mouth with a slingshot.

49
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:57,714
What slingshot?

50
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:59,653
- Do you have a slingshot?
- I'm not sure.

51
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:01,055
Give it to me.

52
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:08,598
Mr. Wilson is very angry with you.

53
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:11,593
I thought he was sick.
I was only trying to help.

54
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:14,703
You go sit in the corner
and think about what you've done.

55
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,872
- For how long?
- UntiI you're sorry.

56
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,431
Oh, good. I'm sorry now.

57
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,102
He can't sit in the corner.

58
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:22,976
I have to take him
to Margaret Wade's house.

59
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:25,547
Margaret's house!

60
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,915
I didn't do anything bad enough
to deserve to go to her house.

61
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:31,819
She's a lunatic. I'll go crazy.
She tortures me.

62
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,722
She's mean. She's ugly.
She doesn't share!

63
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:40,220
I arranged with Mrs. Wade for you
to go to their house while I work.

64
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,597
Are you serious?

65
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,534
You can't spend the summer unsupervised.
You're out of schooI.

66
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:46,900
I'll go back.

67
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:50,998
Your mother made arrangements.
That's it! I don't want any arguments.

68
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:57,137
My life is falling apart.

69
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,186
Hello, George.

70
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:12,028
Let me take that off your hands. Sorry.

71
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:15,988
I'm...

72
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:20,263
I'm sorry about this morning.

73
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:24,101
I won't mince words, Mitchell.

74
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,002
Your kid is driving me nuts.

75
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:30,647
- I'll talk to him again.
- Maybe it isn't talk that he needs.

76
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:34,583
When my dad had something important
to tell me, he told me with his belt.

77
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:37,086
That's not how I deaI with my son,
Mr. Wilson.

78
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:38,515
However you deaI with him...

79
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,185
...he hasn't learned you don't shoot
an aspirin down a fellow's throat!

80
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:46,558
- Mr. Wilson, he's five.
- When I was five, I had some respect.

81
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:49,532
You were probably an exceptionaI boy.

82
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,400
In 1925, I was not the exception,
I was the rule.

83
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:55,803
I'll make sure
Dennis doesn't come by anymore.

84
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:57,704
CarefuI how you say it.

85
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:01,142
I don't want everybody to think
I'm a child-hater or an ogre.

86
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:04,444
I'm a reasonable man
who expects reasonable treatment...

87
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:06,506
...from his neighbors and their children.

88
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:10,179
I was with the post office
for more than 43 years, and never once-

89
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:11,380
I'm running a little late.

90
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:14,390
I'll come by after work
and we can continue the conversation.

91
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,916
There's nothing to continue.
I've said my piece. We'II leave it at that.

92
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:21,328
The boy cannot come over here
unless he behaves himself.

93
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,832
He won't be over at all.

94
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,927
Now don't make me out to be a grump.
I didn't say "never. " I said-

95
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:28,869
I really have to go.

96
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:31,741
Well, now, don't...

97
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:36,437
Have a good day.

98
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:38,879
He's out of schooI now.

99
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:41,440
He can't spend all his free time here.

100
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,147
I'm not the bad guy in this, Mitchell.

101
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:45,779
I'm the victim!

102
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:49,652
George, who were you shouting at?

103
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:53,695
Mitchell, and I wasn't shouting.
I was making my point.

104
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:57,298
It's not right that his youngster
can run wild doing as he pleases...

105
00:10:57,368 --> 00:11:00,098
...without regard to people or property.

106
00:11:00,204 --> 00:11:02,172
He's only a boy, George.

107
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,240
He'll knot my rope once too often.

108
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:07,141
I can't stand that kid! He's a menace!

109
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:11,914
You'd better come in and have breakfast.
We're due at the Garden Club at 9:00.

110
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:17,120
Today is an important day for me, and
I'm already in a lather because of that kid.

111
00:11:17,188 --> 00:11:20,521
I don't know if I'll even be able
to enjoy my moment of triumph.

112
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:22,559
Don't get your hopes up.

113
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:26,226
There are lots of other gardens in town
just as nice as yours.

114
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:28,162
Please! I'm a shoe-in.

115
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:34,936
Who else has a night-blooming mock orchid
flowering this year?

116
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:39,268
It's an awfully homely looking plant.

117
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:41,442
Hang the looks of the thing!

118
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:44,413
It opens before your eyes
in the light of the full moon.

119
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,040
It's a marveI, Martha.

120
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:48,551
Forty years to mature and blossom.

121
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:51,981
The flower opens and withers
in a matter of moments.

122
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:54,718
There isn't a gardener in town
with a plant that requires...

123
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:58,455
...a 40-year investment
for 10 seconds of splendor.

124
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,875
How do you feeI about me working?

125
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:18,076
A lot of moms work.

126
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:23,017
The best I could do finding someone
to watch you is Mrs. Wade.

127
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:28,452
What about Joey?
Did you think about him?

128
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,086
What if he comes over?
He'll think I moved.

129
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:35,597
Joey's mother made plans
with Mrs. Wade just like I did.

130
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,926
Joey's at Margaret's house.

131
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:47,337
Do it!

132
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,347
- I can make you.
- How?

133
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,611
I'll slug you back.

134
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:57,483
- You can't hit a girI.
- I can too.

135
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:00,985
Try it. I'll scream
so awfully, bloody, deadly horrible...

136
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:03,049
...my mom'll think you tried to murder me.

137
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,063
I'll say you did and she'll believe it.
Because boys are like that and girls aren't.

138
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,698
That really stinks.

139
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:10,734
Quit wasting time.

140
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:13,998
Mush your lips together
and let's get this over with.

141
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,101
Close your eyes!

142
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,978
Kiss me.

143
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,856
All right. Let's go.

144
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:38,826
Dennis, come on.

145
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,391
Oh, gosh.

146
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:42,261
Acting like a baby.

147
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:45,324
Get up!

148
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,299
Right this instant!

149
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:51,433
Don't you dare embarrass me!

150
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,440
Fine, I'll drag you inside.

151
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,147
You guys are the boring ones.
There's lots to do.

152
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:05,552
Oh, really? Like what?

153
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,757
We could practice singing songs.

154
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:09,190
Or put on a play...

155
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,955
...or a puppet show.

156
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,657
- We could bury you alive.
- I could pound your face.

157
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:17,259
It doesn't matter, anyways, Margaret.

158
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:20,702
We'll be leaving soon
and we have work to do.

159
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,705
We're going to make a fort.

160
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:26,537
You can't leave unless I go with you,
or I'll tell on you.

161
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,908
So, tough kitty paws, I'm going.

162
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:32,206
Climb down from there. I'll get my purse.

163
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:09,878
This thing's been here our whole life
and we never knew it.

164
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:13,651
- Do you think anybody lives in it?
- Just squirrels and birds.

165
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:15,624
It looks kind of junky.

166
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:17,258
We'll fix it up.

167
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:19,654
Good. I'll be the decorator.

168
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,996
We'll put on a speciaI room for the babies
and a powder room for guests.

169
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:26,798
Forts don't have powder rooms.

170
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:28,305
Really?

171
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:31,364
Where do the soldiers' wives go
to freshen up?

172
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:35,108
Soldiers don't have wives, stupid.

173
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,276
Don't call me stupid, baby rump kisser!

174
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:44,250
It won't be a fort. It'll be a house.

175
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:45,954
A love nest.

176
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:50,156
Let's go up and see
what color carpet we should get.

177
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:52,424
Do forts got carpet?

178
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:53,695
Nope.

179
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,130
Forts don't got carpet!

180
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,532
They do now, hot lips!

181
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:05,435
The Selection Committee has informed...

182
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:08,043
...Mrs. Butterwell and I...

183
00:16:08,245 --> 00:16:13,046
...that this summer's Floraganza
will be held in the garden of...

184
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:19,184
Can you read this here?

185
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:25,518
You take these and I'll take those.

186
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,728
There we go. The garden of...

187
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:33,797
...George Wilson!

188
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:48,476
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi...

189
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:51,020
...four Mississippi, five Mississippi.

190
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:52,282
Six Mississippi...

191
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:56,793
...seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi,
nine Mississippi.

192
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:00,121
Gunther, are you watching
where everybody goes?

193
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:02,389
Yep.

194
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,401
Girls. Now...

195
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,506
Let's go!

196
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:18,914
You know,
I was unbeatable at hide-and-seek.

197
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:20,548
Hiding or seeking?

198
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:23,211
Both. I had a nose for hiding places.

199
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:25,982
I wouldn't think you'd be much good
at hiding.

200
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,284
Why not?

201
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,323
Weren't you a fat boy?

202
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:32,127
I was husky.

203
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,491
Ready or not, here I come!

204
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:39,796
I see Joey and Mike!

205
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,235
Run, Mikey!

206
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:43,295
He's cheating.

207
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,202
What are you doing?

208
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:50,877
Dennis is cheating.
He's using the Beckman kid as a spy.

209
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,442
Leave them alone, George.

210
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,680
I'll even things up.

211
00:17:55,986 --> 00:18:00,582
Gunther, I'm just talking to your daddy
on the telephone.

212
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,659
He's going to the ice-cream store.
He wants to take you with him.

213
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:07,120
Hurry up and go home!

214
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,891
Now it's fair.

215
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,469
You lied to a toddler, George.

216
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:21,906
Think how disappointed he will be
when he gets home.

217
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:26,006
He better get used to it.
Disappointment will be a big part of his life.

218
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,951
He's a foot short for his age.
And he's cross-eyed.

219
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,978
Ain't that a pretty sight?

220
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:36,478
I bet they don't even lock their doors.

221
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:44,892
You won't notice a toy store
on the first leveI...

222
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:46,429
...but my suggestion is this:

223
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:50,660
Give the toy store six months free rent
to move up to the third leveI.

224
00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:00,042
When I go to the mall with my little boy,
we always visit the toy store.

225
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:05,275
He knows he won't get anything unless
it's a speciaI occasion, but like every kid...

226
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:06,816
...he wants to look around-

227
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:09,444
Could you spare us the family anecdotes?

228
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:14,319
There's always a lot of traffic in toy stores.

229
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:17,986
If people have to go up to the third leveI
to visit the toy store...

230
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:21,326
...then they have to go through
two other levels to get there.

231
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,491
That's apparent to anyone with children.

232
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,899
And you have to assume
that potentiaI tenants...

233
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:28,597
...might have kids and would know that...

234
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:32,698
...and it might entice them
to take up space in the other levels.

235
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:35,642
That's all I'm saying.

236
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:43,319
We could have carried up a lot more stuff...

237
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,413
...if you didn't have to bring that idiotic doll
and all her junk!

238
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:51,291
She's not idiotic!
She's an important training tooI.

239
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:55,593
You know why men are so lousy
when it comes to taking care of babies?

240
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:58,129
They have better things to do.

241
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:01,237
Like what? Play golf and drink beer?

242
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:06,174
No, like hunting, having wars, driving cars,
shaving, cleaning fish.

243
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:07,709
Do you know how to do that?

244
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:08,870
Me?

245
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,271
Margaret.

246
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:11,209
Oh, okay.

247
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,875
If you didn't have women,
you wouldn't have babies...

248
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:16,108
...and you wouldn't have people.

249
00:21:16,553 --> 00:21:20,455
If you didn't have men,
who'd drive the ladies to the hospitaI?

250
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:27,185
Most important, they marry the women,
then the women can go and get the baby.

251
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:29,494
The baby is in her stomach!

252
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:34,631
She has to get it installed.
Her stomach isn't just filled up with babies.

253
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:37,970
- Who installs them?
- A minister and a doctor.

254
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,540
- How?
- How?

255
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,410
She wants to know how?

256
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,984
Tell me, Dennis, how?

257
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:53,086
The bellybutton. It opens up.

258
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:58,051
- How come men have them?
- So they don't look weird in bathing suits.

259
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,355
Okay, on the count of three...

260
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,261
...move your hand.

261
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:05,426
One.

262
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:08,996
Two.

263
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,701
Three!

264
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:20,873
Okay, this time on the count of four.

265
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:22,843
One.

266
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,344
Two.

267
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:26,715
Three.

268
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,382
Four!

269
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:33,958
Joey, you hold the hammer
and, Margaret, you hold the naiI.

270
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:50,977
We did a pretty good job.

271
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:53,846
- How about a little paint?
- Couldn't hurt.

272
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:56,249
- You got any?
- My dad does.

273
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:07,192
- Give me my doll, you jerk!
- I don't have it!

274
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:11,458
- Give it to me! Dennis!
- I didn't take your doll.

275
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:13,935
It's not here. Somebody took it.

276
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,096
We've been with you.

277
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:23,640
Do you guys swear you didn't take it?

278
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:24,872
Yep.

279
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,177
I've been robbed!

280
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:39,160
You don't understand.
Baby Louise is a very expensive antique.

281
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:41,688
Nobody robbed your doll.

282
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:43,765
- Maybe a bear ate it.
- What?

283
00:23:44,134 --> 00:23:46,967
Yeah, there's no robbers in our town.

284
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:45,017
What are you eating there, sport?

285
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:47,485
A apple.

286
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:04,299
Hi, Mr. Mitchell.

287
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:06,606
Hello, Polly. Come on in.

288
00:26:06,743 --> 00:26:10,008
- What's the helmet for?
- My girlfriend used to baby-sit for Dennis.

289
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,742
She said to bring a helmet and wear pants.

290
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:52,579
I'm looking for Polly.

291
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,639
You're Mickey?

292
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:56,076
Yeah.

293
00:27:56,753 --> 00:28:00,189
She's up in my mom's bathroom
using the armpit perfume.

294
00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:04,488
She says you're such a stud,
she gets nervous and sweats a lot.

295
00:28:05,628 --> 00:28:06,617
CooI.

296
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,595
Come on in.

297
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:51,206
Tastes funny.

298
00:28:58,348 --> 00:29:00,009
Tastes like paint.

299
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:04,281
And wood.

300
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:08,953
I'll make us some sandwiches.

301
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,306
"'Do not cry, little locomotive,'...

302
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,817
"... said old Engine Number 99 to Huffy.

303
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:39,516
"'One day when you grow up,
you will realize...

304
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:42,581

305
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:45,788
"'... even little maiI trains. "'

306
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:50,657
How can a train grow?

307
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:53,896
He eats all his coaI
and gets plenty of sleep.

308
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:58,207
No, what's the point of reading lies?

309
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:02,307
It teaches kids to eat all their food...

310
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:05,245
...and go to bed when they're supposed to.

311
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:09,681
And not cry when mean cabooses
and boxcars make fun of them.

312
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:13,555
This is so stupid.

313
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:16,558
Are you ready to get out of here
and go to bed, yet?

314
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:20,117
I'm not even wrinkled up yet.
Keep reading.

315
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:30,237
"'I will never be big enough to pull anything
but silly old maiI cars,'...

316

00:30:48,424 --> 00:30:50,153
Where are you going?

320
00:30:59,002 --> 00:31:01,800
I'm going to investigate Mitchell's garage.

321
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:05,705
Dennis has been fooling around with paint.
I know it, and I will prove it.

322
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:09,103
Aren't you taking this a bit far, George?

323
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:11,571
He's only a boy.

324
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:09,029
Kids!

325
00:32:26,556 --> 00:32:28,251
G.D. wading pooI!

326
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:41,300
That's it!

327
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:42,421
Gee, I guess those kids took off.

328
00:33:58,614 --> 00:34:00,377
I got him this time.

329
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,750
Mitchell can't deny it.

330
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:23,897
Sorry. Good night.

331
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:32,872
He's only a boy, huh?

332
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:14,447
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.

333
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:17,589
Is Mr. Wilson up yet?

334
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,250
Not yet, dear.

335
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:21,930
How long do you think he's going to sleep?

336
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:25,229
Not too much longer.
He's having his picture taken this morning.

337
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:29,031
- For what?
- He's being honored for his garden.

338
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:33,235
Do you think he would get mad
if I went upstairs?

339
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:36,544
What do you want to go upstairs for?

340
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:40,048
I made an "I'm Sorry I Shot Paint
on Your Chicken" card.

341
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,741
That's very nice, Dennis.

342
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,351
I'm kind of busy today,
so I won't have a chance to give it to him.

343
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,217
I have to go to Margaret's house...

344
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:53,262
...because we're getting poor,
and my mom's got a job now.

345
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,025
Could I leave it by his whisker cutter?

346
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:58,833
That's where I leave
my dad's "Sorry" cards.

347
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:01,631
And it's a good time to say you're sorry.

348
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:04,537
Grownup guys are happy in the morning
when they wake up.

349
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:05,801
My dad's so happy...

350
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:08,139
...he whistles
when he goes to the bathroom.

351
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,974
The only time he isn't happy
is on Sunday morning...

352
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:12,639
...when he and my mom wrestle.

353
00:36:12,715 --> 00:36:14,740
They like to be alone when they do that.

354
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:17,012
I think it's because they take off
their shirts.

355
00:36:17,086 --> 00:36:18,713
Then they start to make funny noises-

356
00:36:18,788 --> 00:36:19,880
You can go up...

357
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:22,982
...as long as you promise
not to disturb Mr. Wilson.

358
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:24,390
I promise.

359
00:36:29,198 --> 00:36:31,291
You know what, Mrs. Wilson?

360
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,759
What?

361
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:35,770
You're the nicest old gaI on the block.

362
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:34,885
Hello.

363
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:38,128
My name is Dennis Mitchell.

364
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:42,799
I'm the doctor. Open up and say...

365
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:19,096
Hello.

366
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:28,876
Mr. Wilson.

367
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,314
George? Are you ready?

368
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:34,980
The photographer's here.

369
00:38:38,127 --> 00:38:39,856
I got a 9:30, ma'am.

370
00:38:40,162 --> 00:38:42,130
He'll be out any second.

371
00:38:43,332 --> 00:38:44,424
Sorry.

372
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:49,660
George?

373
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:59,076
That looks fine, Martha. Leave it alone.

374
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,749
Martha, step back. You're in the picture.

375
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:07,920
Very good.

376
00:39:08,324 --> 00:39:09,552
Now...

377
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:10,814
...smile.

378
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:05,339
Hey, you.

379
00:40:06,816 --> 00:40:08,807
Yeah, you. Come here.

380
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,857
I haven't seen you around here before.

381
00:40:21,097 --> 00:40:23,793
Maybe because
I've never been around here.

382
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:25,366
What are you up to?

383
00:40:25,434 --> 00:40:27,061
What's it to you?

384
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:28,158
Now, look.

385
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:32,533
I run a nice, clean town here
and I don't want any trouble.

386
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:36,139
My advice to you
is just follow the sun out of here.

387
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:39,943
Only reason I ain't moving on because
you stopped to give me the breeze.

388
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:09,203
You have to go to two other levels
to get there and...

389
00:41:15,784 --> 00:41:17,718
Can I call you back?

390
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,879
Hi, Mom.

391
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,092
Good morning.

392
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:27,390
I hear you're trying to beg off
the Oklahoma City trip.

393
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:29,888
I asked that it be rescheduled.

394
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,794
Have a Cub Scout meeting or something?

395
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:36,233
My husband has a trip
that was scheduled before mine.

396
00:41:38,174 --> 00:41:41,439
If you two are traveling at the same time,
no one can watch your kid.

397
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,841
Is that the problem?

398
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,574
- It's not a problem, per se.
- Oh, good.

399
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:49,778
Because if you want to blow off your trip,
I have to cover for you.

400
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:52,417
And I have plans I can't break.

401
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:54,856
I don't have kids but...

402
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,351
...I do have a life.

403
00:41:58,794 --> 00:42:00,125
I'm sorry.

404
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,157
I just won't be able to help you.

405
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:11,730
God.

406
00:42:13,308 --> 00:42:15,401
- Okay.
- Who do we call first?

407
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:18,704
Let's start with the A's.

408
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,938
Vicki?

409
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:21,504
- You call.
- No, you call.

410
00:42:24,118 --> 00:42:24,948
Hello.

411
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:28,644
Hi. This is Mrs. Mitchell.

412
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:36,897
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

413
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,262
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

414
00:42:41,002 --> 00:42:41,696
No.

415
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:47,498
This is Henry Mitchell.

416
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:52,237
This is Henry Mitchell.

417
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:08,991
You call.

418
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:27,110
Hey, Mr. Wilson. I'm sleeping at your joint.

419
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,182
- I brought you some grasshoppers.
- You shouldn't have.

420
00:43:35,456 --> 00:43:36,980
I'll take them, dear.

421
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,687
Thank you so much, Martha. George.

422
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,020
It's our pleasure.

423
00:43:43,097 --> 00:43:46,498
- You saved our lives.
- Save two, lose one.

424
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:48,694
I'll call you just as soon as I arrive.

425
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,295
- Do you have our number?
- Don't worry about a thing.

426
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:56,499
I brought my own pillow
so I don't get my spit on yours.

427
00:43:56,577 --> 00:43:58,169
Thank you, dear.

428
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:02,112
Be a good boy, okay?

429
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:08,585
Mind your manners
and listen to Mr. and Mrs. Wilson.

430
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,127
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

431
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:17,991
Honey?

432
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:21,357
Bye-bye.

433
00:44:21,436 --> 00:44:23,700
Bring me something good.

434
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:24,999
'Bye, sweetheart.

435
00:44:25,073 --> 00:44:26,540
'Bye, Dennis.

436
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:31,807
George, take Dennis' suitcase
up to the guest room, please.

437
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,545
- He's got arms.
- Don't start, dear.

438
00:44:37,785 --> 00:44:40,754
You know why I'm not crying?

439
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,881
Because if I can't be with my parents...

440
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:47,655
...the person I want to be with is you.

441
00:44:50,798 --> 00:44:53,926
I can't tell you how deeply moved I am.

442
00:45:20,228 --> 00:45:21,855
Don't do that, please.

443
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:22,725
What?

444
00:45:22,797 --> 00:45:23,991
The cord.

445
00:45:24,065 --> 00:45:25,726
Stop that tapping.

446
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:33,768
There's not a lot to do around the house
when it's raining out.

447
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:38,811
- Do you wanna play cards?
- No.

448
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:44,082
Want to put on your old Navy suit
and play war?

449
00:45:54,328 --> 00:45:56,728
- Is that pirates' gold?
- No.

450
00:45:57,565 --> 00:45:59,089
Is it reaI valuable?

451
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:00,790
Yes.

452
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:03,896
Is that why you keep it in your safe?

453
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:05,161
Uh-huh.

454
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:08,801
How come your safe looks like books?

455
00:46:10,745 --> 00:46:13,236
How come you ask so many questions?

456
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:16,215
I've only been around for five years.

457
00:46:16,284 --> 00:46:18,377
There's a lot of stuff I don't know.

458
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:24,314
The safe looks like books...

459
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:28,195
...so if a thief does come in,
he won't recognize it.

460
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,060
- Is a thief a robber?
- Yes.

461
00:46:31,265 --> 00:46:34,132
- Have you ever had a robber here?
- No.

462
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:36,993
What's the combination to your lock?

463
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:42,140
You're the last person in the world
I'd tell that to.

464
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,737
You've got it wrote down someplace?

465
00:46:44,812 --> 00:46:46,211
It's in my head.

466
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,011
- What's that mean?
- It means I know it. I remember it.

467
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:53,914
- What if you forget it?
- I won't forget it. It's a familiar number.

468
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:55,387
I won't forget it.

469
00:46:55,623 --> 00:46:57,250
What's that mean?

470
00:46:57,391 --> 00:47:01,919
It means it's a number
that I use all the time, so I won't forget it.

471
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,095
I use it all the time.

472
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:07,394
- I bet I know what it is.
- I doubt that.

473
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:09,829
I bet it's your address.

474
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:12,136
Know how I know?

475
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:13,969
My friend has a bike lock...

476
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:18,603
...and he uses his address
for the combination so he won't forget.

477
00:47:18,846 --> 00:47:20,973
- You're just as smart as him.
- He.

478
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:24,879
You got everything figured out, don't you?

479
00:47:26,187 --> 00:47:30,681
I haven't figured out
how to get my work done...

480
00:47:30,758 --> 00:47:32,749
...with you in the house.

481
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:35,957
That's a tough one.

482
00:47:53,347 --> 00:47:55,474
Are you wrinkled enough yet, Dennis?

483
00:47:57,585 --> 00:48:00,315
- Yep.
- Want me to come help you out of the tub?

484
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:03,322
Not unless you want to see
what the stork saw.

485
00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:29,841
CooI!

486
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:31,641
Old FaithfuI.

487
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:43,019
- How old is this bed?
- It belonged to my mother.

488
00:49:43,424 --> 00:49:45,324
What's she sleeping on?

489
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:47,986
She's been gone for many years, Dennis.

490
00:49:50,097 --> 00:49:51,860
- On business?
- No.

491
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:54,359
She's in heaven.

492
00:49:55,303 --> 00:49:58,101
There's an awfuI lot of people in heaven.

493
00:49:58,806 --> 00:50:00,671
Especially old people.

494
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:16,315
How about if I recite my favorite poem
when I was your age?

495
00:50:16,924 --> 00:50:19,154
- Is it about flowers and lambs?
- No.

496
00:50:20,027 --> 00:50:21,016
Okay.

497
00:50:23,698 --> 00:50:27,429

Poor thing.
I wish he'd get that hernia fixed.

520
00:54:00,147 --> 00:54:02,138
George, are you sleeping?

521
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:05,983
I was untiI you started yakking.

522
00:54:06,387 --> 00:54:07,718
I'm sorry.

523
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,283
Was Dennis in our bathroom?

524
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:13,916
Yes.

525
00:54:14,495 --> 00:54:18,955
I think the little rat
put mouthwash in my nasaI spray...

526
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:22,263
...and toilet cleanser in my mouthwash.

527
00:54:23,704 --> 00:54:26,229
Why would he do something like that?

528
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:29,742
Must you ask?

529
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:36,743
Quiet!

530
00:54:38,752 --> 00:54:41,243
I recited a poem for Dennis tonight...

531
00:54:41,922 --> 00:54:44,618
...that my mother used to recite to me.

532
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:47,994
I remembered every word.

533
00:54:50,464 --> 00:54:52,364
In some tiny measure...

534
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:56,659
...my mother would be proud
I passed something on.

535
00:54:57,538 --> 00:54:59,199
It's 10:00, Martha.

536
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,335
Don't start with the regrets.

537
00:55:07,114 --> 00:55:09,446
I would have been a good mother.

538
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,947
And I would have made a swell fireman.

539
00:55:29,336 --> 00:55:32,794
- Where are you going?
- To make myself a cup of tea.

540
00:55:36,877 --> 00:55:39,937
I didn't decree
that we wouldn't have children.

541
00:55:40,514 --> 00:55:42,812
That was out of both our hands.

542
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:48,078
This isn't about having children
or not having children.

543
00:55:48,622 --> 00:55:50,146
You miss the point.

544
00:55:51,592 --> 00:55:53,059
It's about...

545
00:55:54,461 --> 00:55:57,055
...my feeling something very good...

546
00:55:57,798 --> 00:56:00,266
...and not being able to tell you about it.

547
00:56:41,175 --> 00:56:42,164
Martha?

548
00:56:48,315 --> 00:56:50,340
I didn't mean to hurt you.

549
00:56:51,118 --> 00:56:54,281
I'm not terribly good
with feelings and emotions.

550
00:56:55,489 --> 00:56:59,516
There are a lot of subjects
I'd just as soon not bring up or discuss.

551
00:57:00,427 --> 00:57:03,362
I would have liked a son or a daughter.

552
00:57:04,898 --> 00:57:07,992
You couldn't fire the fatherly feelings
in me...

553
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:10,561
...because they're not there.

554
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:14,939
But that doesn't mean my feelings for you
have gone cold.

555
00:57:15,008 --> 00:57:16,805
That'll never happen.

556
00:57:17,911 --> 00:57:20,209
You've got all the love I have.

557
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:24,073
Remember this?

558
00:57:24,918 --> 00:57:28,979
<i>Je t'aime. Je t'adore. Ma petite chérie.</i>

559
00:57:38,098 --> 00:57:39,087
George.

560
00:57:52,946 --> 00:57:54,641
Get out of here!

561
00:58:00,354 --> 00:58:02,584
What are you looking for now?

562
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:04,849
Garden lanterns.

563
00:58:05,793 --> 00:58:10,287
You must be pretty brave to ride
on a tiger in your underpants.

564
00:58:10,664 --> 00:58:12,928
Put that away. That's not for kids!

565
00:59:13,493 --> 00:59:14,482
Martha.

566
00:59:14,962 --> 00:59:17,453
Where are the G.D. garden lanterns?

567
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:46,756
I think I better go outside and play.

568
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:07,836
Hello.

569
01:00:08,682 --> 01:00:09,706
Hello, Martha.

570
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:11,815
It's Alice.

571
01:00:11,952 --> 01:00:13,385
I'm still in Oklahoma.

572
01:00:13,787 --> 01:00:15,049
Oh, dear.

573
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:17,552
<i>Yes, there's a terrible storm.</i>

574
01:00:17,624 --> 01:00:18,886
<i>My flight's been cancelled.</i>

575
01:00:19,493 --> 01:00:22,690
Till the weather clears,
I don't know what's going to happen.

576
01:00:24,564 --> 01:00:27,124
<i>I know your garden party's tonight.
I feel terrible.</i>

577
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,498
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

578
01:00:29,903 --> 01:00:33,236
Don't worry about it.
You get home when you can.

579
01:00:33,907 --> 01:00:35,704
We'll be just fine here.

580
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:38,403
What's George going to say?

581
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,814
Over my dead body!

582
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:47,883
This is my crowning moment of retired life
and I won't throw it away like the trash...

583
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:51,550
...for a ninny who can't get her keister
to the airport on time.

584
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:54,594
George Wilson,
you have no right to insult Alice.

585
01:00:54,661 --> 01:00:57,687
She can't help the weather,
any more than you or I.

586
01:00:57,764 --> 01:00:59,356
It's just plain bad luck.

587
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:01,162
It's no one's fault.

588
01:01:01,234 --> 01:01:04,965
A tragedy of this magnitude
has to be somebody's fault.

589
01:01:05,038 --> 01:01:06,767
It isn't a tragedy.

590
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,636
A little boy's going to join us for a party.

591
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:14,744
If you want to forsake your neighbors
when they need help, do it alone.

592
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:19,713
Why is it, when everyone else
feasts on the pleasures of life...

593
01:01:19,786 --> 01:01:21,151
...I get the indigestion?

594
01:01:21,221 --> 01:01:23,348
Because you're an old grump.

595
01:01:40,273 --> 01:01:42,537
We did a pretty good job.

596
01:01:43,076 --> 01:01:44,509
Uh-huh.

597
01:01:45,045 --> 01:01:48,139
Now we can order furniture
and major appliances.

598
01:02:39,132 --> 01:02:40,724
Well, Dennis...

599
01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:43,268
- ... your mother did not arrive.
- Nope.

600
01:02:44,337 --> 01:02:46,771
This is an important event for me.

601
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,234
I know.

602
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:50,070
I don't want any nonsense.

603
01:02:50,143 --> 01:02:53,601
You mind whatever manners you have
and don't be a pest.

604
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,669
Okay.

605
01:02:54,748 --> 01:02:56,511
Don't embarrass me.

606
01:02:56,616 --> 01:02:57,605
Okay.

607
01:02:59,786 --> 01:03:01,310
Cheek pinchers.

608
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:07,886
Look at the cute little boy.

609
01:03:10,864 --> 01:03:12,991
Are you our little host?

610
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,930
The party's in the back.

611
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:19,603
Ladies, girls, the party's in the back.

612
01:03:19,673 --> 01:03:23,234
Thank you very much.
It's just this way, thank you.

613
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:25,539
Don't embarrass me.

614
01:03:30,317 --> 01:03:31,750
Attention, everyone.

615
01:03:31,818 --> 01:03:33,649
Gather over here, please.

616
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,087
Have a seat.
It's time to begin the ceremony.

617
01:03:37,557 --> 01:03:39,889
All right, members, don't be timid.

618
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,360
Move down front. Plenty of seats.

619
01:03:42,496 --> 01:03:44,487
Either side, either side.

620

Thank you, everyone. I am honored.

629
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:20,192
I will cherish this forever.

630
01:04:21,568 --> 01:04:23,126
Forty years ago...

631
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:26,601
...when I started this garden,
I planted a seed.

632
01:04:28,108 --> 01:04:30,201
From that tiny seed...

633
01:04:31,244 --> 01:04:33,235
...grew this grand plant.

634
01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:36,743
Tonight...

635
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:41,310
...for the first and only time
in its entire life, it will blossom.

636
01:04:42,522 --> 01:04:44,422
As we await this glorious moment...

637
01:04:44,491 --> 01:04:48,052
...Martha and I invite you
to have some desert and coffee.

638
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:52,760
Congratulations.

01:05:04,377 --> 01:05:06,743
George, would you bring the coffee?

640
01:05:16,056 --> 01:05:18,320
George, don't start, George.

641
01:05:20,293 --> 01:05:23,558
Could you get somebody
to come and clear this away?

642
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,427
I made a mistake.

643
01:07:23,216 --> 01:07:24,808
Mr. Wilson!

644
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:27,812
Somebody robbed your house.

645
01:07:50,944 --> 01:07:53,708
Forty years down the drain.

646
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:11,797
You're a pest.

647
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:13,127
A menace.

648
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:16,960
A selfish, spoiled little boy
and I have no use for you.

649
01:08:18,304 --> 01:08:21,398
You took something from me
that I can never get back.

650
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:24,204
Something that means more to me
than you ever will.

651
01:08:24,511 --> 01:08:26,035
You understand?

652
01:08:27,113 --> 01:08:29,741
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to know you.

653
01:08:31,418 --> 01:08:33,079
Get out of my way.

654
01:08:36,656 --> 01:08:38,681
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.

655
01:08:40,393 --> 01:08:43,328
Party's over, everybody. Go on home.

656
01:08:43,396 --> 01:08:44,727
I'm sorry.

657
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:32,210
Oh, my God!

658
01:09:34,814 --> 01:09:36,111
Where's Dennis?

659
01:10:20,693 --> 01:10:22,957
Joey hasn't seen him all night?

660
01:10:24,731 --> 01:10:25,823
Okay.

661
01:10:25,899 --> 01:10:28,493
Well, if he shows up, please call me.

662
01:10:29,068 --> 01:10:30,057
'Bye.

663
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:40,301
- Did you call the Wades?
- Yes.

664
01:10:40,513 --> 01:10:43,311
But that's the last place he'd go.

665
01:10:49,989 --> 01:10:52,514
<i>Don't you ever come back here again.</i>

666
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:54,849
<i>He's a menace.</i>

667
01:10:56,195 --> 01:10:57,685
<i>Turn that off!</i>

668
01:10:58,464 --> 01:11:01,831
<i>Don't make a pest of yourself
and don't embarrass me.</i>

669
01:11:03,303 --> 01:11:06,761
<i>I don't want to know you.
I don't want to see you.</i>

670
01:11:06,873 --> 01:11:08,602
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

671
01:11:22,355 --> 01:11:24,550
These woods are pretty scary at night.

672
01:11:24,624 --> 01:11:27,024
I'm sure glad I ran into a grownup.

673
01:11:27,193 --> 01:11:29,184
It'll work out reaI nice.

674
01:11:29,562 --> 01:11:32,224
- You can be my hostage.
- CooI!

675
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:36,427
I can only be your hostage till tomorrow.

676
01:11:36,869 --> 01:11:38,860
I have church in the morning.

677
01:11:40,907 --> 01:11:42,932
You ain't going to church.

678
01:11:43,476 --> 01:11:46,707
You and me are catching the midnight train
out of here.

679
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:47,768
Really?

680
01:11:48,348 --> 01:11:52,011
We better stop at my house first.
I have to tell my mom and dad...

681
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:53,245
...or else they'll worry.

682
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:56,379
And I must get clean underwear
and my camera...

683
01:11:56,789 --> 01:11:59,587
...and tell my parents to feed my fish...

684
01:11:59,692 --> 01:12:01,057
...some sun block...

685
01:12:01,127 --> 01:12:05,496
...and vitamins and stuff to play with
on the train so I don't get bored.

686
01:12:05,565 --> 01:12:07,897
Put a cork in it.
You're giving me a headache.

687
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:08,991
I don't have a cork.

688
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:10,660
Shut your mouth!

689
01:12:11,004 --> 01:12:13,905
I can't because my nose is stuffy
because of my allergies.

690
01:12:13,973 --> 01:12:15,838
If I shut my mouth, I can't breathe good.

691
01:12:15,908 --> 01:12:18,741
Then keep your mouth open, but don't talk!

692
01:12:20,813 --> 01:12:24,112
Where do you put the cork
when you put a cork in it?

693
01:12:25,018 --> 01:12:26,952
Didn't I ask you to shut your yap?

694
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,147
What's a yap?

695
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:31,417
It's your mouth.

696
01:12:31,491 --> 01:12:34,324
I can't shut my mouth
because my nose is stuffy.

697
01:12:34,394 --> 01:12:35,622
Shut up!

698
01:12:45,304 --> 01:12:47,295
I have one more question.

699
01:12:49,075 --> 01:12:50,167
What?

700
01:12:50,677 --> 01:12:52,975
What does a hostage have to do?

701
01:12:53,413 --> 01:12:54,539
Nothing.

702
01:12:54,614 --> 01:12:55,911
How come you need one?

703
01:12:56,816 --> 01:12:59,080
In case the cops show up.

704
01:12:59,619 --> 01:13:01,109
Do I get to use a gun?

705
01:13:01,187 --> 01:13:04,623
You get to stand in front of me
if the cops use a gun.

706
01:13:06,993 --> 01:13:08,790
I've got a slingshot.

707
01:13:09,829 --> 01:13:10,887
Swell.

708
01:13:10,963 --> 01:13:13,158
I'm a good shot. Want to see?

709
01:13:15,401 --> 01:13:18,859
Excuse me, mister. Do you want to see?

710
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,867
Mister, can you watch me for a minute?

711
01:13:26,145 --> 01:13:28,238
I'll tell you when to look.

712
01:13:37,356 --> 01:13:38,516
Look!

713
01:13:42,829 --> 01:13:45,024
Your fire's getting puny.

714
01:13:46,933 --> 01:13:51,267
When my dad's fire gets puny,
he wiggles it around and it gets bigger.

715
01:14:37,383 --> 01:14:38,407
Dennis!

716
01:14:49,762 --> 01:14:51,059
Dennis!

717
01:14:54,066 --> 01:14:57,365
I'm sorry
you're not having a very fun camping trip.

718
01:14:59,005 --> 01:15:02,372
Nobody shoots a marble at my head...

719
01:15:02,441 --> 01:15:04,375
...and sets my pants on fire.

720
01:15:04,777 --> 01:15:06,142
That was an accident.

721
01:15:06,212 --> 01:15:09,045
There ain't going to be no more accidents!

722
01:15:09,715 --> 01:15:11,114
Turn around!

723
01:15:22,328 --> 01:15:24,193
You're doing it wrong.

724
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:25,592
Get lost.

725
01:15:26,132 --> 01:15:28,566
I tied up lots of guys in my life.

726
01:15:28,801 --> 01:15:32,259
I bet you've never tied up a 5-year-old.
I'll just get out.

727
01:15:32,338 --> 01:15:35,307
I'll tie it so tight
you won't be able to move.

728
01:15:35,374 --> 01:15:38,673
The rope's too big and my legs are
too small to make it tight enough.

729
01:15:39,312 --> 01:15:41,507
There's only one way to do it
and I know because...

730
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:44,516
...many people have tried to tie me up
but it doesn't work.

731
01:15:44,584 --> 01:15:45,915
But you try your way.

732
01:15:45,985 --> 01:15:48,749
I'll get out
and you'll just have to keep doing it.

733
01:15:56,829 --> 01:15:58,353
What do you do differently?

734
01:16:03,469 --> 01:16:07,098
First, you must tie up each leg by itself.

735
01:16:07,573 --> 01:16:09,666
Then you tie them together.

736
01:16:27,026 --> 01:16:30,291
No matter how much I wiggle,
I can't ever get out.

737
01:16:32,365 --> 01:16:35,061
If you really don't want me to move at all...

738
01:16:42,074 --> 01:16:43,405
Bend down.

739
01:16:48,014 --> 01:16:50,209
You can't get out of that at all, right?

740
01:16:54,687 --> 01:16:55,517
Nope.

741
01:16:55,588 --> 01:17:00,184
You tie me up like that, no matter
how much I try, I can't ever get out.

742
01:17:00,459 --> 01:17:01,448
Thanks.

743
01:17:02,995 --> 01:17:05,156
- Now let me loose.
- Okay.

744
01:17:05,498 --> 01:17:06,829
Get the handcuff key.

745
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:09,026
- Where is it?
- On my bag.

746
01:17:33,592 --> 01:17:34,684
What?

747
01:17:38,998 --> 01:17:40,192
Dennis!

748
01:17:44,103 --> 01:17:45,195
Dennis!

749
01:17:57,216 --> 01:17:58,706
I'm going to kill you.

750
01:17:58,784 --> 01:18:01,082
How? You can't move. Open up.

751
01:18:01,587 --> 01:18:03,111
I ain't hungry!

752
01:18:03,422 --> 01:18:05,822
It's the only way to get the key.

753
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:07,755
You can't waste food.

754
01:18:07,927 --> 01:18:10,225
Plus, you must eat your dinner.

755
01:18:13,232 --> 01:18:14,460
Come on.

756
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,199
Come on.

757
01:18:18,771 --> 01:18:20,261
It's coming.

758
01:18:29,281 --> 01:18:30,509
Too hot?

759
01:18:48,634 --> 01:18:50,829
You must have swallowed it.

760
01:18:54,173 --> 01:18:56,141
I swallowed my allowance once.

761
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:59,575
I had to wait a whole night and a day
to get it back.

762
01:19:10,523 --> 01:19:11,512
Dennis!

763
01:20:02,741 --> 01:20:05,141
Firewood. Bombs away!

764
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:24,586
Poor little lamb.

765
01:20:24,897 --> 01:20:27,263
He must be exhausted.

766
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:31,497
I better cover him up
so he doesn't catch his death of cold.

767
01:21:20,553 --> 01:21:21,986
There we go.

768
01:21:50,783 --> 01:21:52,808
What's he got a purse for?

769
01:21:59,225 --> 01:22:00,624
Holy smokes!

770
01:22:00,993 --> 01:22:02,324
He's rich!

771
01:22:17,042 --> 01:22:18,566
Don't worry, I got it!

772
01:22:18,644 --> 01:22:20,942
I got it! I got it!

773
01:23:06,258 --> 01:23:07,725
Dennis!

774
01:23:10,396 --> 01:23:12,921
I've lost the only man I ever loved.

775
01:23:24,643 --> 01:23:26,474
I'll get you out of there.

776
01:23:26,545 --> 01:23:30,447
You shouldn't jump in a river
with handcuffs on, for God's sake!

777
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:32,942
You could drown.

778
01:23:41,293 --> 01:23:43,318
Hold on. I'm coming.

779
01:23:47,266 --> 01:23:48,665
Hey, mister!

780
01:23:49,935 --> 01:23:52,961
Good thing I know a lot about ropes, huh?

781
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:59,600
That's my boy!

782
01:23:59,712 --> 01:24:02,374
Mr. Wilson taught me how to tie knots.

783
01:24:02,514 --> 01:24:06,473
When I get you out, I'm going to bed.
I'm beat.

784
01:24:07,419 --> 01:24:09,546
It must be all the fresh air.

785
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:14,588
Hold on, I'm coming.

786
01:24:24,303 --> 01:24:28,137
There you go. Now just pull yourself in.

787
01:25:16,488 --> 01:25:18,513
This is Mr. Wilson's gold.

788
01:25:19,792 --> 01:25:22,488
- How come you got it?
- I stole it.

789
01:25:22,995 --> 01:25:24,360
You're a robber?

790
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,590
I'm a thief.

791
01:25:27,966 --> 01:25:30,366
Say your prayers, little rat!

792
01:25:30,502 --> 01:25:32,902
I can't. I didn't take my bath yet.

793
01:25:32,971 --> 01:25:34,802
Have it your own way.

794
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:49,629
Martha!

795
01:27:49,942 --> 01:27:50,931
Mitchell!

796
01:28:02,554 --> 01:28:04,886
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

797
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:25,600
- Guess what?
- What?

798
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:29,309
I got your gold back.

799
01:28:31,183 --> 01:28:32,172
Dennis!

800
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:37,211
Mom! Dad!

801
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:42,221
Oh, sweetheart! Thank God, you're okay.

802
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,234
Help.

803
01:29:15,861 --> 01:29:18,853
This is my buddy. This is my paI.

804
01:29:29,975 --> 01:29:30,964
Wait a minute.

805
01:29:31,076 --> 01:29:35,206
You can tell everybody at the big house
you met our Dennis Mitchell.

806
01:29:37,816 --> 01:29:39,579
All right. Let's wrap it up.

807
01:29:43,622 --> 01:29:44,611
Mister.

808
01:29:46,391 --> 01:29:48,325
You forgot something.

809
01:29:53,432 --> 01:29:54,421
Dennis!

810
01:30:20,258 --> 01:30:22,556
I like that rhubarb pie that Martha makes.

811
01:30:22,627 --> 01:30:25,357
- WonderfuI dinner.
- Thank you, Henry.

812
01:30:25,797 --> 01:30:27,526
Alice, your coffee.

813
01:30:30,435 --> 01:30:31,561
Guess what?

814
01:30:31,636 --> 01:30:33,365
I won't have to traveI anymore.

815
01:30:33,438 --> 01:30:34,837
That's nice.

816
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,338
They want me to work on the project here.

817
01:30:37,409 --> 01:30:41,004
They agreed to start a daycare center
so I can take Dennis with me to work.

818
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:42,740
That's ridiculous!

819
01:30:43,381 --> 01:30:45,815
What the heck's he going to do all day?

820
01:30:45,884 --> 01:30:47,511
Don't be foolish.

821
01:30:47,619 --> 01:30:50,679
We're right next door. We can watch him.

822
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:54,220
Well, of course. We'd love to.

823
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:56,590
I don't think...

824
01:30:56,762 --> 01:31:01,199
I mean, you must remember back
to all the times Dennis upset you.

825
01:31:01,867 --> 01:31:05,200
This is a new ball game.
I've learned a few things.

826
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:06,464
Kids are kids.

827
01:31:07,572 --> 01:31:09,870
You have to play by their rules.

828
01:31:10,242 --> 01:31:12,767
If you can't do that, you're in trouble.

829
01:31:12,844 --> 01:31:14,903
You must roll with the punches.

830
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:17,278
You must expect the unexpected.

831
01:31:42,574 --> 01:31:46,203
Aren't you supposed to be
in the daycare area with the other children?

832
01:31:47,345 --> 01:31:49,575
That's where I was, but I had to leave.

833
01:31:49,714 --> 01:31:51,705
The lady who watches the kids said...

834
01:31:51,783 --> 01:31:54,877
...if she had to look at me
for five more seconds...

835
01:31:54,953 --> 01:31:57,751
...she'd jump out the window.

836
01:31:58,723 --> 01:32:00,486
She's a pretty nice lady...

837
01:32:00,692 --> 01:32:02,683
...so I wouldn't want her to do that.

838
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:07,527
Can I push the button?

839
01:32:07,599 --> 01:32:10,295
No, because you don't know
which button to push.

840
01:32:23,114 --> 01:32:24,809
It's this one!

841
01:32:34,893 --> 01:32:37,054
I'm going to get this little kid!
