1
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,300
Why? Why can't I...?

2
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,100
That's not the answer.

3
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,800
I just can't flap my wings fast enough.

4
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,400
Maybe seagulls can't fly
faster than 62 miles per hour.

5
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
But wouldn't it be great if we could?

6
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,200
I wonder how high I could really fly,

7
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,300
what the world would look like
from way up there.

8
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,300
My wings are heavy.

9
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,900
I don't feel steady.

10
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,000
I didn't fall all the way.

11
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,200
I can do it.

12
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I've got to make it higher
than anyone's ever flown before.

13
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,300
I can.

14
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,300
I can see everywhere.

15
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,300
How am I gonna tell them?
How am I gonna say it?

16
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,400
Mother, Father...

17
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,800
...I hope you'll understand.

18
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,900
This time you have to.

19
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,100
I've found things
that will change our lives.

20
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,200
There's such a world out there.

21
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,100
None of us
have ever seen it or felt it.

22
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,900
I've just flown up today
higher than we ever fly,

23
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,100
far above the highest clouds.

24
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,400
But you can see.

25
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,200
I mean, you can see everywhere.

26
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,300
For the first time in my life
I see where we live.

27
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,800
Son, we looked everywhere
for you the last few days.

28
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,500
The elders in the flock
are talking about you.

29
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,300
They know you fly off on your own,

30
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,100
where we never fly.

31
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,000
They don't understand it.
They will not allow it.

32
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,100
Not allow me to learn? Why?

33
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Oh, I can understand
your dreams, Jonathan.

34
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,700
We all dream of better things
when we're young.

35
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,300
I'm afraid...

36
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,100
...for you.

37
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,500
I'm afraid of what you're doing.

38
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,900
Maybe this isn't the best life,
but it's all we know.

39
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
Winter's coming.

40
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,800
The flock must stay together to survive.

41
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,700
We were meant
to live the way we live, accept it.

42
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,400
Take your place.

43
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,500
Will you try, Son?

44
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,500
If you don't,
we will have all lived for nothing.

45
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,200
We weren't meant to live this way.

46
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,800
I know you're wrong.

47
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,400
But... I'll try.

48
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,400
Maybe the secret is fixed wings.

49
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,400
Flap up to 50
and hold the wings still.

50
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,400
I'll bet that's it.

51
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,000
Fifty and still.

52
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,400
It won't hurt anybody
if I try that. Will it?

53
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,700
It won't hurt anybody,
take away anybody's freedom

54
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,400
if I just slip out and give it a try.

55
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,500
Nothing to worry about.

56
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,000
Just a very simple thing here.

57
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,800
I'm going to make a simple dive,
to 50 miles per hour

58
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,700
and hold the wings steady
and go straight on down.

59
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,800
Here we go.

60
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,500
This is it.

61
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,700
Thirty, 40, 50...

62
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,300
No. No! Pull out!

63
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,300
I... I can't do it.

64
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,800
I'll be killed.

65
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What is this? I'm afraid.

66
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,900
I'm on the right way of doing this,
and I'm afraid.

67
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,000
So, what are you going to do?

68
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,100
You going to glide around here for
the rest of your life without trying?

69
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,000
If you're scared, go back to the flock
where everyone else is scared too.

70
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,100
Sixty... 70.

71
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,500
Faster than any seagull has ever...

72
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,500
Pull!

73
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,200
There's got to be more
to life than fighting

74
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,700
for some fish head somewhere.

75
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,800
There's no way around it.

76
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,700
If I was meant to learn
so much about flying,

77
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,900
I'd have charts for brains.

78
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,800
If I were meant to fly fast,
I'd have a falcon's short wings,

79
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,300
live on mice instead of fish.

80
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,400
I've got to live with what I am.

81
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,900
I promise this day
that I will be a seagull...

82
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,500
...like every other seagull.

83
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,300
Does my life end here?

84
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,100
I can't believe that.

85
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,700
I wasn't born to drown in this ocean.

86
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
I can die here,

87
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,400
or I can force myself to fly.

88
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,500
It's in me.

89
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,100
It's in me!

90
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,700
I've got to try.

91
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,800
I've got to get back home.

92
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,500
At last I can stop thinking,
for once in my life.

93
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,100
Just stop thinking

94
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
and fly towards the lights in the dark.

95
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,600
Dark?

96
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Seagulls never fly in the dark.

97
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,600
Get down.

98
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,000
If you were meant to fly in the dark,
you'd have the eyes of an owl.

99
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,600
You'd have charts for brains.

100
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,300
You'd have a falcon's short wings.

101
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,700
A falcon's short wings.

102
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,000
I dive on the wingtips only.

103
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,100
Why didn't I think?

104
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,100
Short wings. Short wings.

105
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,100
Faster than any seagull anywhere. Ever!

106
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,300
I'll teach the others.
I'll show the flock how!

107
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,400
I did it!

108
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,800
It works.

109
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,500
Short wings all controlled. It works!

110
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,900
I must have hit 1 70 in the dive,
and that was just a short dive.

111
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,600
What will I hit if I dive
from 1 0,000 feet?

112
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,400
A quick roll in, fold the wings,
just the tips out in the air,

113
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,400
take her straight down
just like last night,

114
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,200
and we'll see
just how fast a seagull can fly.

115
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,700
One-eighty! One-ninety!

116
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,100
Oh, God! The flock!

117
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,000
Look out!

118
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,100
The elders. The whole flock.

119
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,100
They believe me now.

120
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,300
They finally understand.

121
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,900
Jonathan Livingston Seagull...

122
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,100
...you have been called here

123
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,700
to be judged in the sight of your flock.

124
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,800
Jonathan Gull,
for your reckless flying,

125
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,800
for refusing to join the flock
to which you were born,

126
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,900
for turning your back
upon the traditions of your flock,

127
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,700
assembled here.

128
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
I haven't turned my back.

129
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,300
I want to share what I've found
with all of you.

130
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,800
Jonathan Livingston Seagull,
you do not live as we live.

131
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,200
You do not fly as we fly.

132
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,200
You do not believe as we believe.

133
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,600
You will learn that life is the unknown

134
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,800
and the unknowable.

135
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,500
We are put into this world
to survive any way we can,

136
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,100
as long as we can.

137
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,500
I don't believe that.

138
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,200
Jonathan Seagull,
the brotherhood is broken.

139
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,300
Never again will you
see any of your flock.

140
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Never again will you have
the protection of your flock.

141
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,600
You are henceforth and forever outcast!

142
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,000
Outcast.

143
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,700
- Jonathan.
- Why, Jonathan? Why?

144
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,200
No. This is not your sky.

145
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,600
This is my sky! My sky!

146
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,000
Stay out! My sky!

147
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,000
I will fly where a seagull
has never flown before.

148
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,800
I will see every land, every ocean.

149
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,700
I will know all there is
to know of this life.

150
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,000
Who are you?

151
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,500
Hello, Jonathan.

152
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,900
We're from your new flock.

153
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,500
We're your brothers.

154
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,100
We've come to show you a higher place.

155
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,500
I don't have any flock.

156
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,400
I'm old, I'm tired.

157
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,000
I can't fly any higher.

158
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,000
But you can, Jonathan.

159
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,100
For you have learned.

160
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,500
One school is finished,
and it is time for another to begin.

161
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
Oh...

162
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,600
...I see.

163
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,800
Am I an outcast here too?

164
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,000
Jonathan, we've come to take you home.

165
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,100
It's time to begin.

166
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,300
I don't know quite where I am.

167
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,100
Have I slept a long time?

168
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,000
Only for a short while.

169
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,600
I'm Maureen, your instructor here.

170
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,600
We're going to learn together.

171
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,200
Maureen.

172
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,100
Your name came into my mind
even before you said it.

173
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,200
Welcome home.

174
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,200
Home? I've never been here before.

175
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,700
Maybe not.
Feels like home though, doesn't it?

176
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,100
Everything feels different.

177
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,100
Where is everybody?

178
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,500
Why aren't there more of us here?

179
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,800
The only answer I can see, Jonathan,

180
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,400
is that you were pretty well
a one-in-a-million bird.

181
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,100
Most of us came along ever so slowly.

182
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,400
We went from one world into another
that was almost exactly like it,

183
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,200
forgetting right away
where we'd come from,

184
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,300
not caring where we were headed,

185
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,500
living for the moment.

186
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,100
Do you have any idea how many lives
we must have gone through

187
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,100
before we even got the first idea
that there is more to life

188
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:26,900
than eating or fighting
or power in the flock?

189
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,000
Many lives, Jon.

190
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:34,900
And then other lives to learn that
there is such a thing as perfection.

191
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,100
And others again, to finally get
the idea that our purpose for living

192
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,900
is to find that perfection

193
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,600
and show it forth.

194
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,500
But you, Jonathan,
learned so much at one time

195
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,200
that you didn't have to go
through 1 00 lives to reach this one.

196
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,400
My life back there,
I don't remember very well.

197
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,300
Everything's blurred, I...

198
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,900
All those years.

199
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,800
Cast out? Alone?

200
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,400
Yes. But it was a fine life.

201
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,400
Didn't you say you know me
from somewhere?

202
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,700
I believe there were
many somewheres.

203
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,400
I know what it is to speak,
to feel and never to be heard.

204
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,400
Can I really learn
to fly without limits?

205
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,100
Maybe you'll find something
that will mean even more to you

206
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,400
than flying without limits.

207
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,600
To learn what perfection really is.

208
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,500
Let's try some real flying now.

209
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,300
You're adjusting very well
to your new body, and to the air here.

210
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,600
It's almost time for you
to meet the elders here.

211
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:02,000
I don't want to see
an elder as long as I...

212
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,100
Well...

213
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,500
Are you afraid to say ''live''?

214
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,000
Have you ever felt more alive? Happier?

215
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,000
No, that's...
that's just the point. I...

216
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,300
I don't want any elder
telling me what I can't do.

217
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,900
This is your new flock, Jonathan.

218
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,200
What was that?

219
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,700
Maureen?

220
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,600
Look up there.

221
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,600
Oh, I was afraid he'd gone away.

222
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,000
Jonathan, that's Chiang.

223
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:21,100
Not bad, for a feeble old elder.

224
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:26,900
Maureen, I never saw
anyone fly like that.

225
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,200
Good evening, Maureen.

226
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,700
Jonathan.

227
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,400
Good evening, Chiang.

228
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,900
Hello, sir.

229
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,900
It's an honour to meet you.

230
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,800
The honour is mine, Jonathan Seagull.

231
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,500
Maureen.

232
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,200
He learns well?

233
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,700
A little impatient is all.

234
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,500
He knows everything I know.

235
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,000
And more now.

236
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,100
Maureen, how can you say that?
I have so much to learn.

237
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,400
You know so much more than I.

238
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,900
Jonathan, you know it now.

239
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,500
You still need to practise
smoothness and patience,

240
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,600
but you know the flying very well.

241
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,800
I still have questions.

242
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,200
Ask whatever you want.

243
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,200
I... Well...

244
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,900
Chiang, this world
isn't heaven at all, is it?

245
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
Where we are now.

246
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,200
It isn't heaven at all.

247
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,200
Who said it was?

248
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,300
Heaven isn't a place.

249
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,300
Heaven's perfection.
Wouldn't you think?

250
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:58,000
And we don't go there,
as much as we express it.

251
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,100
Does that sound true to you?

252
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,900
Yes.

253
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,300
I suppose.

254
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,200
You're a very fast flyer.

255
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,500
Well, I... I enjoy travelling quickly,

256
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,400
but I don't like limits.

257
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:20,500
I want to fly faster than I can now
and higher and learn more.

258
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,300
I can fly 276 miles per hour now.

259
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,600
Level. That's pretty fast,
but it's not fast enough.

260
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:34,700
Don't ask me why,
but it just isn't fast enough.

261
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,300
What is fast enough, Jonathan?

262
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,200
You who are impatient to be perfect.

263
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,100
What is perfect speed?

264
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,300
Well...

265
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,800
...perfect speed.

266
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,400
A thousand miles per hour?

267
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,300
That's a limit.

268
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,800
A million miles an hour?

269
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,900
That's a limit.

270
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,300
Speed of light?

271
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,100
That's a limit too.

272
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,800
They're all limits.

273
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:12,100
Perfect speed, my son,
isn't moving fast at all.

274
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,600
Perfect speed is being there.

275
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,200
So...

276
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,500
Maureen, did you see that?

277
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,800
He says we can all learn that,

278
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,900
whenever we want to learn it.

279
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,700
The next life maybe.

280
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,100
It is not so difficult, Jonathan,

281
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,800
once we understand.

282
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,800
I want to understand, now.

283
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,000
What does it feel like?

284
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,800
How far can you go?

285
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,000
To any place, to any time

286
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,600
that you wish to go.

287
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,500
I've gone everywhere
and every-when I can think of.

288
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,300
After a while, one begins to think

289
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,100
that space and time are not quite real.

290
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,600
Can you teach me to fly like that?

291
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,200
Of course. If you want to learn.

292
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,600
Yes, I want. When can we start?
I'll do anything.

293
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,600
Maureen, did you see...?
I've got to learn.

294
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,600
How do you do it?
I mean, how...?

295
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,000
First, you let your teacher
get a word in edgewise.

296
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,700
I'm sorry, Chiang.

297
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,600
It's just that all my life...

298
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,700
I can't explain it.
...I've had this...

299
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,400
This need to know.

300
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:36,000
To fly as fast as thought,
to anywhere that is now,

301
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:40,200
or ever has been or ever will be,

302
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:46,000
you begin by knowing
that you've already arrived.

303
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,700
I beg your pardon?

304
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,900
I am already there,
on that highest peak.

305
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:02,900
I am not limited by any body.

306
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,700
I am not limited by space.

307
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,500
I am not limited by time.

308
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,500
I am a perfect expression
of freedom, here and now.

309
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,700
All right, here I go.

310
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,400
I am going right... now!

311
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,700
Now!

312
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,200
Now?

313
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,700
Jonathan?

314
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,500
Can I bring you anything?

315
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,200
No.

316
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,100
Nothing.

317
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,000
I have to do this.

318
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:09,100
I don't care how long
I have to stand here, I will do it.

319
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,600
Would you like to take a break?

320
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,700
Good evening, sir, I...

321
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,500
I'm concentrating as hard as I can.

322
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,200
I just can't get it.

323
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,200
Jon, you don't need faith.

324
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,800
You don't need faith to fly.

325
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,500
You need to understand flying,
don't you?

326
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:44,300
To learn certain facts
about things you cannot see.

327
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,400
This is just the same.

328
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:50,500
I am a perfect expression
of freedom and flight.

329
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,000
Why am I thinking that way?

330
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,200
This isn't some ritual.

331
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,000
Real is real.

332
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,300
I really am a perfect idea.

333
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,500
It works. It really works.

334
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,300
Well, of course it works, Jonathan.

335
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,300
It always works
when you know what you're doing.

336
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,400
Now, about your control...

337
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,900
Well, it's different anyway.

338
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,600
We're trapped in here.

339
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,400
There's no way out of here.

340
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,200
Jonathan, there's a way out.

341
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,700
Oh... yes.

342
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,300
But why did I come here at all?

343
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,400
Like attracts like.

344
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,700
Wherever your thought is,
that is where your body is going to be,

345
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,500
sooner or later.

346
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,800
You're just learning to do it sooner.

347
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,900
Did you want to be walled away,
to think this over?

348
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,700
Here you are.

349
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,800
Try it again.

350
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,200
And hold your thought
on something you've always loved.

351
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:01,100
I know things I love, but I'm not sure.

352
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:05,700
Do it. I'm with you.

353
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,500
I have always liked stars.

354
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,300
It is a fine view.

355
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,800
And a good place to be alone.

356
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,100
But so much of love is giving,
don't you think?

357
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:21,800
Sharing the very best you know
with someone who's trying to learn.

358
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:26,100
Try it again,
and this time, think giving.

359
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,600
No special names or place.

360
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,400
Just think love
and see where you turn up.

361
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,400
Ready?

362
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,500
Any time.

363
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,400
What's this?

364
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,100
What's happening?

365
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:44,600
My old flock. I don't love them.

366
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,900
Don't you, Jonathan?

367
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:51,500
Well, I always did want to give them
what I'd learned about flying,

368
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,200
if that's what you mean by love,

369
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,000
but I never found the way.

370
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,800
When the time is right
for you to give to them,

371
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,400
nothing can keep it from happening.

372
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,400
When it's wrong,
nothing can make it be.

373
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,500
I can't see how that can ever happen.

374
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,500
Don't worry about it.

375
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,200
Try it, once more now.

376
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,900
Think love and being in the place
that's right for you to be now.

377
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,100
Hello, Maureen.

378
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,200
Hello, Jonathan.

379
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,600
The time's come for me to leave you.

380
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,500
There are others I must help.

381
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,600
And there is more for me to learn.

382
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,200
You can't leave now. l've only begun.

383
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,000
Jonathan Seagull,
someday you will know

384
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,000
how long ago your flight began

385
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:51,100
and how great a journey
you have travelled.

386
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,700
Now you are ready
to begin the most difficult

387
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,200
and the most powerful journey of all.

388
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:04,500
You are ready to fly up and know
the meaning of kindness and love.

389
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,800
Jonathan, you were born
to be a teacher,

390
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:14,400
to give the truth to anyone
struggling to break out of his limits.

391
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,400
It is important to give
what you have found, as a gift,

392
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,300
to whomever will accept it.

393
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,100
Chiang, I know I'll see you again.

394
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,800
Of course you will, and, Jonathan,

395
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,900
keep working on love.

396
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,200
What's the matter?

397
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,500
How much more I would've known,
if someone like Chiang

398
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,500
had come along the day
I was an outcast.

399
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,600
What a different life I would have had.

400
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,500
What a different life
the flock back there would've had.

401
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,600
Maureen, I have to go back.

402
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,600
We're always parting.

403
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,300
We're always saying goodbye.

404
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,800
I know you don't want me to go.

405
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,400
I know my old flock
doesn't care what flying is.

406
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,600
They don't care about learning.

407
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:54,600
They don't care about looking
beyond what they see with their eyes,

408
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,200
but, Maureen, there's got to be
somebody in that time who cares.

409
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,600
Jonathan, go with my love.

410
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,900
Maureen, goodbye for now.

411
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,700
I love who you are, Jonathan.

412
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,300
Fletcher Lynd Seagull,

413
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:26,000
you were born to us,
but you are not part of us.

414
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,100
You cry against the flock

415
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,300
and against the law.

416
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,700
You ask questions,
answered 1 ,000 years ago.

417
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,300
You do not wish
the protection of the flock.

418
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,100
And you shall not have it.

419
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,400
You are henceforth and forever...

420
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,100
...outcast!

421
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,600
I don't want your protection.

422
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,100
You're gonna wish you never...

423
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,500
All your ''henceforth and forever.''

424
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,100
It's not gonna be me
who needs protection.

425
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,200
It's not gonna be me!

426
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,700
I don't care what they say.

427
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,500
There's one hell of a lot more to flying

428
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,100
than just flapping around from A to B.

429
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,500
A mosquito can do that.

430
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,800
One little barrel roll around the elder
to show him what's possible,

431
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,100
and I'm outcast.

432
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,300
Can't they see?

433
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,100
Can't they...
they think of the glory it'll be

434
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,600
when we really find out how to fly?

435
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,800
Damn the flock.

436
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,300
I'll be outlaw all right.

437
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,400
Outlaw like they never saw before.

438
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,600
I'll make them so sorry.

439
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,200
Don't hurt them, Fletcher Seagull.

440
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,600
Who are you?

441
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,400
In casting you out, the other gulls
have only hurt themselves,

442
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,600
and one day they will know this,
and one day they will see what you see.

443
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,900
Forgive them and help them understand.

444
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,000
I don't understand.

445
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,500
Fletcher Lynd Seagull,
do you want to learn to fly?

446
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:21,000
Do you want to fly so much that you
will forgive the flock? And learn?

447
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,800
And go back to them one day
and help them know?

448
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,200
I do!

449
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,000
Then, Fletcher, let's begin
with level flight.

450
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,300
We're all outcasts.

451
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,000
We're all friends.

452
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,600
We're learning to fly
just for the fun of it.

453
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,800
Take your time.

454
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,200
Your whole body
from wingtip to wingtip

455
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,200
is nothing more
than your thought itself,

456
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,400
in a form you can see.

457
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,500
Break the chains of your thought,

458
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,200
and you break the chains
of your body too.

459
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,600
That's fine, Fletcher. Judy Lee.

460
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:20,300
Fly it nice and loose
until you get used to formation flying.

461
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,800
We'll just go on practicing,

462
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,900
and you can slide in closer
whenever you feel like it.

463
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,600
Fletcher, it's time to go.

464
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,500
Time to go where, Jonathan?

465
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,200
Back to the flock.

466
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,700
We have a gift to give.

467
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,400
But we're not ready.

468
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:43,600
We're not welcome.
Jonathan, we're outcast.

469
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,000
We can't force ourselves
where we're not welcome, can we?

470
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,000
And it's the law of the flock!

471
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,000
We're free to go where we wish
and to be what we are.

472
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,300
Why should we bother with the flock?

473
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,600
Seagulls are the laziest,
dirtiest, most vicious...

474
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,500
Suspicious, clumsiest.
A seagull hardly knows how to walk.

475
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:05,700
But don't you see, Fletcher?
A seagull wasn't made to walk.

476
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:09,100
He was made to fly,
and when he learns to fly,

477
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:13,900
he's the purest, loveliest,
most graceful creature alive.

478
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,900
True for you, true for me,
true for all the flock.

479
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:23,800
We can soar free across the sky,
but how often we don't want to.

480
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,100
That's the gift we can give,

481
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:33,200
to help those who want to learn
find what they love to do.

482
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,900
It is the law of the flock
that an outcast never returns.

483
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:01,900
Anyone who follows them,
anyone who listens to them,

484
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:07,000
anyone who turns his back on the flock
will be outcast too!

485
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,500
I only wish to share what I've learned.

486
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:13,400
The very simple fact
that it is right for a gull to fly

487
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,500
because freedom
is the very nature of his being.

488
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,900
Whatever stands against that freedom
must be set aside.

489
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,100
We don't need ritual
and superstitions to live.

490
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,400
The law of the flock decides!

491
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,600
Do you speak of law?
Is it the law which decrees

492
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:33,100
we must fight among ourselves
just to feed on garbage?

493
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,000
It can't be!

494
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,200
The only true law
is that which sets us free.

495
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,900
There can be no other.

496
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,700
How can you expect us
to fly as you fly?

497
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:47,100
You are special and gifted and divine,

498
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,400
above other birds.

499
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:52,800
Look at Fletcher,
Charles-Roland, Judy Lee.

500
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,000
Are they also special
and gifted and divine?

501
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,400
No more than you are.

502
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,300
No more than I am.

503
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,400
The only difference, the very only one,

504
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,000
is that they have begun to understand
what they really are

505
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,000
and have begun to practise it.

506
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,700
What if we could fly like that?

507
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
They're outcasts. Ignore them.

508
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,900
Don't listen to him. Ignore him!

509
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,200
Ignore them.

510
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,600
Ignore them all. They're outcasts.

511
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,600
Anyone who looks upon an outcast
breaks the law of the flock!

512
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,600
Ignore them.

513
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,400
Ignore him!

514
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,900
Each of us finds and follows
what we most love to do,

515
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,900
no matter what others think.

516
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:56,000
And this brings us automatically
to discover more of who we really are.

517
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,400
There's a law there,
a principle like aerodynamics,

518
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,400
that simply does not fail.

519
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,800
You can count on it.

520
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,300
- Help me.
- Hello, Kirk Maynard.

521
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:10,000
I want to fly more than anything
in the world. Please.

522
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,100
We can start learning right now.

523
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,700
You don't understand.

524
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,700
My wing.

525
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,600
I can't move my wing.

526
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,100
You have the freedom to be yourself,

527
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,900
your true self, here and now,
and nothing can stand in your way.

528
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:27,400
Are you saying I can fly?

529
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:30,500
Kirk Maynard can't fly.
He was born crippled.

530
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:34,700
- He's never been off the ground.
- You're free, Kirk Maynard.

531
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,500
Fly.

532
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,800
Fly.

533
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,000
I can fly.

534
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,500
I can fly!

535
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,900
Listen, I can fly.

536
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,400
I can fly!

537
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,300
This Fletcher says he'll
come right down here

538
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,700
in front of us at 200 miles an hour.

539
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,700
Just to prove it.

540
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:41,600
If he can learn it, I can learn it.

541
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,900
- I'll believe it when he shows us how.
- I'm sorry, I just don't believe it.

542
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:50,400
A normal seagull like you and me is
not meant to fly at 200 miles an hour.

543
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,700
Somewhere up there Fletcher's flying.

544
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,200
I've known him since he was your age.

545
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,800
I'm afraid, Mother.
I want to go with you.

546
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Stay here. I want you safe.

547
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:11,000
Here we go. They won't believe it
till they see it with their eyes,

548
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,700
till we prove it especially for them.

549
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,100
Listen, we should be able to hear him.

550
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,500
Quiet, I think I hear him.

551
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,400
I'm ready.

552
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,500
- Here he comes!
- Do you believe now?

553
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,600
- I can't.
- Mother. Mother! Where are you?

554
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:56,900
Look at that baby bird! He's in
Fletcher's way! He'll get killed!

555
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,800
I had to.

556
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:31,000
I would have hit him.

557
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
- But why?
- The trick, Fletcher,

558
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:38,300
is that we're trying to overcome
our limitations in order, patiently.

559
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:42,300
We don't go flying through rock
until a little later in the programme.

560
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,600
Jonathan!

561
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,100
Also known as the Son of the Great Gull?

562
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,400
What are you doing here? The...

563
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,300
The cliff.

564
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,100
There was a...
a baby gull gliding down.

565
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,600
Haven't I...?

566
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,700
Didn't I... die?

567
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,800
Oh, Fletcher, come on, think.

568
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:07,900
If you're talking to me now,
then obviously you didn't die, did you?

569
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:14,100
You merely changed your level
of thinking... rather abruptly.

570
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:18,800
It's your choice now. You can stay here
and learn on this level,

571
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:22,400
which is quite a bit higher
than the one you left, by the way,

572
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:25,300
or you can go back
and keep working in the flock.

573
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,200
The elders were hoping
for some kind of disaster,

574
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:33,100
but they're startled
that you would oblige them so well.

575
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,700
I want to go back to the flock.

576
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,600
Of course! There's a new group...

577
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I haven't even begun.

578
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,400
You're sure you wouldn't rather stay?

579
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,000
Let's get going.

580
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
All right, Fletcher.
Remember what we were saying

581
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,800
about our body being nothing
more than thought itself?

582
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,400
Fletcher.

583
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,500
Fletcher?

584
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:20,200
It's true.

585
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:24,700
Jon, I'm beginning to see.

586
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,600
- He's alive!
- He touched him with a feather.

587
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,800
- Brought him to life!
- He is the Son of the Great Gull.

588
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:36,400
It's a trick! Don't listen to him!

589
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,200
He's a devil!

590
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,300
He's the devil!

591
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,100
He is the devil. He is the devil!

592
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,400
I tell you he is the devil!

593
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,300
He can destroy us all!

594
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,700
He can destroy the flock!

595
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,800
Kill him!

596
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,300
Kill him!

597
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,500
Kill him!

598
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:41,900
Kill him!

599
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,200
Kill him!

600
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,700
Would you feel better if we left?

601
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,800
They wanted to kill us!

602
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,400
How did we get away?

603
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:13,200
Like everything else,
Fletcher, practice.

604
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,900
I don't understand.

605
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:18,300
The flock was gonna kill us.
Our own flock!

606
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:24,100
Why? Remember what you said
about loving the flock enough

607
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,800
to return to them and help them live?
They wanted us dead.

608
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,300
They're a mob. They're killers.

609
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,100
How can you love them?

610
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,400
You don't love hatred and evil,
of course.

611
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:38,700
You have to practise and see the good
in every one of them

612
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:42,600
and help them see it in themselves.
That's what we mean by love.

613
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,400
It's fun...
when you get the idea of it.

614
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,300
I remember a fierce young bird,
for instance.

615
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,400
Fletcher Lynd Seagull, his name.

616
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:55,100
Just been made outcast,
ready to fight the flock to the death,

617
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:59,300
getting a start on building his own
bitter hell out on the far cliffs.

618
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:03,100
And here he is today,
building his own heaven instead

619
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:06,100
and leading the whole flock
in that direction.

620
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,400
Me? Leading?

621
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,700
You're the instructor here.

622
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,700
You can't leave us.

623
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,400
Don't you think there might be
other flocks, other Fletchers

624
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,500
that need an instructor now
more than this one?

625
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,800
But me, Jon?
I'm just a plain seagull, and you're...

626
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,700
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I know.

627
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,300
The only Son of the Great Gull,
I suppose.

628
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,000
Fletcher, you don't need me anymore.

629
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,500
All the younger ones in the flock
and some of the others too

630
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:36,400
are ready to follow you now.

631
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:41,300
All you need is to keep finding
the real, unlimited Fletcher Seagull.

632
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,200
He's your instructor.

633
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:46,900
And don't let them spread
silly rumours about me

634
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:50,300
or try to make me some
sort of a god, will you, Fletcher?

635
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,200
I'm a seagull. I like to fly, maybe.

636
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,200
Jonathan.

637
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,900
We both have learned what we were meant
to learn in our time together, Fletcher.

638
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:06,200
That the way to find perfection
and love is within us.

639
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,400
Look with your understanding.

640
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,900
Find out what you already know.

641
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:13,800
Use it, Fletcher.

642
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:16,900
Teach it, show it forth.

643
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,700
And you'll know the way to fly.
