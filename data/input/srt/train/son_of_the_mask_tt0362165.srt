1
00:00:57,707 --> 00:01:00,619
The Mifulu represent
a fascinating example

2
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:03,420
of failed culture.
The people of the Mifulu

3
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:05,975
communicated
entirely in rhyme,

4
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,706
although that's actually
less impressive than it sounds,

5
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:12,223
because their language
only contained one vowel.

6
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:14,138
Also, if you've
noticed,

7
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:16,297
the only artifacts
we've been able to unearth

8
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:18,184
are primitive musical
instruments.

9
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,861
The Mifulus had
plenty of drums,

10
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,778
guitars, harmonicas
and the like,

11
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:25,665
but no weapons
or tools.

12
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:29,706
So, in essence,
they had rhythm, they had music,

13
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:32,142
but they had no
hammers and spears,

14
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:34,058
so they died.

15
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:36,900
In any case, this brings us
to the final room of the tour

16
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:39,455
and my personal
favorite-

17
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:42,015
The Hall
of Norse Mythology.

18
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:45,704
This is Odin,

19
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:48,585
chief divinity of the entire
Norse pantheon--

20
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,498
"The Allfather"
as he's called--

21
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:53,465
and these paintings depict
some of Odin's many sons.

22
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,458
That is Thor,
God of Thunder,

23
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:57,378
with his mighty hammer.

24
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,537
And this is Balder,
God of Beauty.

25
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:01,265
Who's that ugly guy?

26
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:03,338
Oh, I was just
about to get to him.

27
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,622
That's Loki,
Norse God of Mischief.

28
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:07,902
He was also known
as "The Trickster."

29
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:10,785
As the youngest
son of Odin,

30
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:13,620
Loki was the black sheep
of the Norse mythological family.

31
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:15,538
His constant
mischievous pranks

32
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:17,458
were an endless source
of embarrassment

33
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:19,378
to his father
and his siblings.

34
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:21,537
He was, in other words,
a bratty little brother.

35
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:25,941
And Loki's ultimate tool
of mischief was this,

36
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:28,302
the mask
which he created

37
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:30,503
and tossed down to earth
thousands of years ago

38
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:33,545
to create mayhem among the mortals.
For, according to legend,

39
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:37,222
the wearer of the mask is imbued
with the powers of Loki himself.

40
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:39,457
- Is that true?
- No, of course not.

41
00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:41,936
If it were, I'd be
wearing it myself.

42
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:44,587
No, no, it's textbook
mythical allegory.

43
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,498
Loki represents
the "id,"

44
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:48,418
the suppressed parts
of ourselves,

45
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:50,577
and the mask is the tool
which unleashes the id.

46
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,977
I go into this very topic
in my critically acclaimed book.

47
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:56,217
Now, of all
the Aesir gods--

48
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:59,583
excuse me, sir.
Please don't touch the mask display.

49
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,339
Of all the Aesir gods,

50
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:03,383
Loki was the only one
who could shape shift--

51
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:06,539
change his form,
even turn himself into a woman.

52
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:09,380
A woman?! Man alive,
lock up your sons and daughters

53
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:12,459
around that twisted
piece of fruitcake, hey, Doc?

54
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:15,015
Well, I guess that's
one way of putting it.

55
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:18,497
Anyway, Loki brought nothing
but shame to Odin and his ilk.

56
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:21,385
In fact, Loki was
such an unruly child

57
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,776
that Odin ultimately
locked him up in chains

58
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,425
far beneath the earth.

59
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:28,579
He did not!

60
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:53,902
- Good God!
- And don't you forget it!

61
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:01,380
Apparently, you do not
agree with my theories.

62
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:07,936
Finally!

63
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:13,019
- This is a fake!
- Yes, but it's a good fake.

64
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:17,538
Ow. Sir, that
is museum property.

65
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:21,984
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me replace it.

66
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,217
What-- what are--
what are you doing?

67
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:27,424
Perhaps I should inform you
I suffer from vertigo

68
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:30,465
and I have a lawyer.

69
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:32,105
Hello?

70
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:35,624
Where's my body?
Come get me.

71
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:38,062
- Yeah. Oh yeah.
- Hold it right there!

72
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:48,901
I don't like it here.

73
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,944
Thanks for dropping by.

74
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,983
- Dropping?
- Bye.

75
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:05,980
Where's... my...

76
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:07,944
mask?!

77
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:59,742
Who's a happy baby?

78
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:03,103
Who's a happy baby?

79
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:05,826
Aw, Clare, he's amazing.
Honey, look at him.

80
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,216
They said he's very
alert for his age.

81
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:10,059
He's going to be
a genius

82
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:12,058
just like his brothers
and sisters.

83
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:15,344
Little Tommy's starting
Junior Mensa next week...

84
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,861
and Clancy just took
his first potty poop.

85
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:19,858
Oh, look. Honey, he just
took his first poop.

86
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,983
Good poop, Clancy!

87
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:27,463
Whoa, Captain Underpants,

88
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,856
watch your aim.
He's gonna need those.

89
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:32,256
- You okay?
- Yup.

90
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:34,065
Here. Mm-hmm.

91
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,736
So, when are you two gonna have
one for yourselves?

92
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:41,697
Oh...

93
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:46,062
It's a boy.

94
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:49,101
And agirl!

95
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:52,816
- Twins?
- And another boy!

96
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,738
- Girl.
- Boy.

97
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:56,658
- Girl.
- Boy.

98
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:59,307
Girl, boy, girl, boy...

99
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:05,464
Tim!

100
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,019
Whew.

101
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,257
Okay, I'm just
gonna say it.

102
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,019
That was flat out
embarrassing.

103
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:15,382
The mere mention
of the word "baby" and your throat

104
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,025
seizes up like
you swallowed Drano.

105
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:18,779
After seeing those kids,

106
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:20,778
Drano sounds like
a good option.

107
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,817
- Honey, just think...
- Yeah?

108
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:27,979
if we have a baby, you'll have someone
you can play video games with.

109
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,466
Mm-hmm.

110
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:34,264
- Hey!
- You'll have someone you can relate to.

111
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:37,419
Okay, honey, look.
I know you're upset, okay?

112
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,067
- But can I ask you one question?
- What?

113
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:43,503
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

114
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:45,179
Tim, stop it.
I mean it.

115
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,576
Look, babe,
who's a turkey?

116
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,498
Bawk bawk bawk
bawk bawk!

117
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:52,306
- I'm serious!
- Who's a rabid dog?

118
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,378
Ow!

119
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,903
- Who's Hannibal the Cannibal?
- Stop it.

120
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,261
Jeez, babe.

121
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,019
Okay, I'm driving--
driving-- driving here!

122
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:14,145
- Ugh.
- Honey, slow down.

123
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,502
You know I can't run and apologize
at the same time.

124
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:19,659
Come on, Tonya. I'm not saying
I don't want to have a baby.

125
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:22,136
I'm just saying I don't want to have
a baby right now.

126
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:25,458
So why not?
Why not now?

127
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,423
- Because.
- Ugh.

128
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,338
Wha-- babe!

129
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,066
Tonya!
Ton-ton--

130
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,906
Hey, Otis.

131
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:40,466
You got room
in your doghouse?

132
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:47,577
Here you go.
Here you go. Yeah!

133
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,340
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

134
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:52,258
Up.

135
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,297
You're good, aren't you?
Now, get in the hole.

136
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:01,143
Tretiak's in the net
for the Soviets.

137
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:03,104
Paul Henderson's out
of the penalty box.

138
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:05,462
He's on the break!
he shoots!

139
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:08,698
Oh, what a save!

140
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:12,666
What a comeback!
Oh! Free beef jerky for everybody!

141
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:15,580
And the ice is being pelted
with Kibbles 'n Bits.

142
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,264
What's this?

143
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:23,181
Now, Otis, how many
times have I told you?

144
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:26,577
If you're gonna steal something,
steal something with a little value.

145
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,306
That's what we're looking for.
Get up here, come on.

146
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:31,343
Come here.

147
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,977
Thanks, pal.
Your kissing is getting a lot better.

148
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,778
You don't want a baby
right now, do you?

149
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:45,138
He said it.

150
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:47,138
Mmm.

151
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:56,259
LOKl!

152
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,659
Dad?

153
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,217
I-I mean,
Oh, masterful Odin, is that you?

154
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:14,583
Have you found
your mask, Loki?

155
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:17,420
I found a mask,
but as it turns out,

156
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:20,101
- it was a fake.
- Why are you relaxing on this beach?

157
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,542
I'm just taking a few
moments reprieve from my--

158
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:24,458
Nonsense!
That mask

159
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:27,107
has caused enough mischief
and malfeasance among the mortals.

160
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,826
I curse the day
you created that thing.

161
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:32,182
Why don't you just use
that all-seeing eye of yours

162
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,827
- and tell me where it is?
- This is your mess

163
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,420
and you will clean it up!

164
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:38,782
You're a god!
Now start acting like one!

165
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,335
Now, find that mask

166
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:44,863
before I open up a can
of lightning on you!

167
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:53,063
Do you need anything
while I'm out?

168
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:55,217
I'm just gonna go make
a baby with the neighbor.

169
00:10:55,307 --> 00:10:57,867
- Honey, come here.
- What?

170
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:00,780
Look! Look at all
this stuff.

171
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:04,424
I've been trying to do
this for 10 years

172
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:07,579
of my life, creating
these shows and--

173
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,936
I just need more time.

174
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:14,621
Okay, I get it, okay?

175
00:11:15,627 --> 00:11:17,504
You want your own show,

176
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:19,657
and I want you
to have your own show.

177
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,863
You're so good!

178
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,778
But I also...

179
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:29,978
really, really
wanna have a baby.

180
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:34,502
So, what do we do?

181
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:36,896
I want our child
to be proud of us,

182
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,818
both of us.

183
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,865
And if somebody asks that child,
"Hey, what does your mommy do?"

184
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:44,984
He's gonna say, "Oh, she's the managing
director of Apt Apparel."

185
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:48,377
They'll say, "Cool." When they say,
"What does your daddy do?"

186
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:51,903
They'll say,
"He's a-- he's a--"

187
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:55,423
Hey, boys and girls.
I'm Torpedo Tortoise!

188
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,862
กำ Here at Animagine,
your dreams come true กำ

189
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:01,496
กำ There's so much fun here
for me and you กำ

190
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,499
กำ Animagine inthe morning,
Animagineatnightกำ

191
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:06,657
กำ If watching cartoons
is wrong กำ

192
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:08,465
กำ I don't want
to be right! กำ

193
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,146
And here's one for you.

194
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:16,463
Halloween party's
tomorrow night, homes.

195
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:18,777
- Got a costume?
- No.

196
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,017
Hey, maybe you could
go as a turtle.

197
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:23,619
Thanks, Chad.

198
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:26,818
I can't believe Chad
got promoted again.

199
00:12:28,107 --> 00:12:31,383
When the executives look at me,
all they see is a tortoise.

200
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:34,618
Hey man, you want things
to change, you gotta make 'em change.

201
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:37,779
- You ever pitch to the top man himself?
- Daniel Moss? Hell no.

202
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,698
Well, then it's time
to man up, my road dog,

203
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:42,426
because there he is.

204
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:45,624
Oh my God.
He never eats lunch down here.

205
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:47,299
He's too busy being
an animation god!

206
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:49,378
Then it's fate, man.
You got to go over there

207
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,935
and say, "Yo, I am
Tim Avery and I've been slugging away

208
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:53,585
in this costume
for six months now

209
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:56,022
and I got an idea
for a show and you need to hear it."

210
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:58,575
Be aggressive, man.
If a bug bites you, bite him back!

211
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,181
Oh, you mean like you
have with Sylvia?

212
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:02,620
Shut up.

213
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:04,459
You know,
maybe I should.

214
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:06,936
- Should what?
- Just walk up to Daniel.

215
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:09,257
- I mean, he's just a guy, right?
- Right.

216
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:12,225
- What do I have to lose?
- You got nothing to lose, man!

217
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:15,582
- I'm gonna do it.
- Are you crazy?

218
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:27,218
Hey, Torpedo Tortoise.

219
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,184
Hi.

220
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,619
Something I can
do for you?

221
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,584
Uhm...

222
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,143
actually, yes.
Yes, you can.

223
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:42,459
Um, see I've been
in the turtle suit for a while now,

224
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:44,265
but, uh, I'm
a trained animator.

225
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,178
I went to school
and everything,

226
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,576
and, uhm, I got an idea
for a show that, uh,

227
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,339
you gotta hear.

228
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:53,066
Cool.
Lay it on me.

229
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:55,103
Now?

230
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:57,018
So what did he say?

231
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:59,575
That my ideas lacked spark,
but the door was always open.

232
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,339
Well, that's
a good thing.

233
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:05,705
No. It's always open so he can push
guys like me out of it.

234
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,061
Come on, Otis.

235
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:14,297
Otis. Come on.

236
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,537
Come on, boy.
Come on, Otis.

237
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:18,345
Thank you, Otis.

238
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,818
You're so sweet
and thoughtful.

239
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:46,177
Which is why you'd make
such a great dad.

240
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,221
- What are you wearing?
- Oh.

241
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,138
Well, I was gonna go
as a werewolf victim,

242
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,024
but Otis ruined my mask.

243
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:57,065
Well, honey, you know,
we've got so much stuff around here.

244
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,377
I don't know, just--
wear that thing.

245
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:00,980
This?

246
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:03,545
I can't go as this.

247
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:06,824
Everyone at Animagine always goes
all out with their costumes.

248
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,467
This is the crappiest
piece of crap in Craptown.

249
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:12,459
Be a lot less crappy
if you went with me, though.

250
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:15,459
I know, but I can't.
I gotta finish the Orion brochure.

251
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,822
- You know what?
- Hmm?

252
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:19,784
Go to the party...

253
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:22,784
have fun,

254
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,698
and when you get home,

255
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:27,301
you can tell me
all about it.

256
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:46,178
So lame.

257
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,023
Whoa!
What the...?

258
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,420
Don't you just
love Halloween?

259
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:42,544
Whoa!

260
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,902
Trick or treat.

261
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,455
Hardy-har.
Let me see your work lD, please.

262
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:53,219
- lD?
- No lD, no party.

263
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:55,662
Where did the wife
put that invitation?

264
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,665
ID, not lV.

265
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:03,897
Excuse me.
My bad.

266
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,943
Maybe I left it in
my other pants.

267
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:12,418
- Crazy!
- Okay.

268
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,738
Here's your drink.

269
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:23,937
This party
is embarrassing.

270
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:25,858
Can't we stir
things up a little?

271
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:28,222
- I'm on it.
- Go get 'em.

272
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,144
Who's that green guy?

273
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,740
You'd better cover up,
young lady.

274
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,306
You might catch
a chest cold.

275
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:44,264
Ah.

276
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,461
What am I thinking?

277
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:51,378
Whoa! Oh!

278
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,935
Hey!
Oh!

279
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:55,904
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Ah.

280
00:17:56,947 --> 00:17:58,824
- Jorge.
- Sylvia.

281
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:00,659
Thank you, God.

282
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,865
- กำ You're just too good to be true. กำ
- Let's go.

283
00:18:04,947 --> 00:18:07,780
กำ I can't take my
eyes off of you. กำ

284
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,505
Boo! Boo!

285
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:11,942
Now hold on.
Where is everybody going?

286
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:14,939
Whoo! All right.
All right!

287
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,860
- Boo! Lame!
- Whoo-hoo!

288
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:20,620
- กำ Yeah, Fringe City in the house! กำ
- กำ Work it! กำ

289
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:23,699
- กำ What, what, what กำ
- กำ This is the part where you dance กำ

290
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:26,301
- กำ This is the part where you boogie กำ
- กำ Ooh, ooh, ooh กำ

291
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:28,821
- กำ This is the part where you dance กำ
- กำ Uh, uh, uh, uh กำ

292
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,546
กำ Shake your booty,

00:18:33,307 --> 00:18:35,263
กำ Shake your pants like this,

295
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,303
กำ Uh, uh, uh, uh,

296
00:18:37,387 --> 00:18:39,059
กำ Ladies,
let me hear you กำ

297
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:41,536
กำ You're just too good
to be true, yeah, good to be true กำ

298
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:43,902
กำ Can't take my eyes off of you,
I love you, baby กำ

299
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:45,818
กำ You feel like heaven
to touch, mm-hmm กำ

300
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,738
กำ I wanna hold you
so much, yeah, yeah กำ

301
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:51,263
กำ At long last, love has arrived,
I thank God I'm alive กำ

302
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,145
กำ You're too good to be true,

303
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:57,105
- กำ Can't take my eyes off of you, yo กำ

กำ Pardon the way

305
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,343
กำ No one else
who can compare กำ

306
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,463
กำ The sight of you
leaves me weak กำ

307
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:10,300
กำ There are no words
left to speak กำ

308
00:19:10,387 --> 00:19:12,218
กำ So if you feel
like I feel กำ

309
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,457
กำ Please let me know
that it's real กำ

310
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:16,697

00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:25,340
กำ I love you, baby. กำ

313
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:26,940
- Yee-haw!
- กำ Don't bring me down กำ

314
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:29,336
กำ I pray, oh pretty baby... กำ

315
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:31,895
- All right!
- กำ Now that I found you กำ

316
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,182
กำ Stay and let me
love you กำ

317
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:36,542
กำ Baby, let me
love you กำ

318
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,458
กำ You're just
too good to be true กำ

319
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:40,219
กำ Can't take my eyes
off you กำ

320
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:43,822
กำ You feel like heaven to touch,
I wanna hold you so much กำ

321
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:47,465
กำ Now at last long,
love has arrived กำ

322
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:49,936
กำ I thank the Lord I'm alive,
you're too good to be true กำ

323
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:52,382
กำ I can't stop watching you,
can't take my eyes off you กำ

324
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,742
กำ Too... good...
to... be... กำ

325
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:04,224
กำ I love you, baby,
hands in the air กำ

326
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:06,377
กำ And if it's quite all right,
I need you, baby กำ

327
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,219
กำ Even though you
don't care กำ

328
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,298
กำ To warm those lonely nights
I love you, babyกำ

329
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:12,582
กำ Allthe ladiesonthe leftกำ

330

กำ Trust in me
when I say กำ

331
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:16,817
กำ Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it, shake it กำ

332
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:19,467
- กำ Oh pretty baby กำ
- กำ All the fellas on the right กำ

333
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,219

334
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:23,104
- กำ Oh, pretty baby กำ

335
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:25,337

00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:28,180
กำ And let me

337
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:31,304
- Jump, jump, jump, jump.
- กำ Let me love you กำ

338
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,257
กำ This is the part
where you boogie กำ

339
00:20:35,347 --> 00:20:37,224
กำ This is the part
where you dance! กำ

340
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:47,457
Honey, I'm home.

341
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:53,899
- Babe, what's gotten into you?
- Let's find out.

342
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,961
That was off the chain
last night, guru.

343
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:37,607
You were a whirling dervish
of craziness, homes.

344
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:40,155
Hey, um, did you--
did you use holograms

345
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:42,238
for-- for all that--
that stuff?

346
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:44,841
Whoa, Avery, I didn't know
you had it in you, man!

347
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:46,963
Yeah, well,
me neither.

348
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:50,003
- Tim Avery?
- Yeah.

349
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:52,157
Daniel Moss would
like to see you in his office.

350
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:54,124
Do you have
a minute?

351
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:10,241
This has potential.

352
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:13,838
Come here.
Come here.

353
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,842
This has that spark
I was looking for.

354
00:22:19,927 --> 00:22:22,725
I mean, not to be
crass about it,

355
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:26,436
but this guy-- this could be
a franchise character.

356
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,003
How'd you come up
with this?

357
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,197
M-my dog brought
it to me.

358
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:37,597
Oh, yeah. If we knew
where the great ones came from,

359
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:39,678
we'd go there
every day, right?

360
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,678
Yeah.

361
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:44,918
Listen,

362
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,646
I think we could
do something with this.

363
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:50,878
How would you
like to move up to the second floor?

364
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:55,398
Where is it?
Where is it?

365
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:03,243
Otis! You know that mask
you were chewing on,

366
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:05,158
the wooden one?
Where is it, boy?

367
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:08,597
Find it and I'll take
you to see Venus--

368
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,076
you know, that cute little Jack Russell
you're always trying to jump?

369
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,920
Yes, I think you guys
would make a good couple.

370
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,838
I don't know.
I don't speak Doberman.

371
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,883
Babe!
I got incredible news!

372
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:20,197
Really?
I think I do too!

373
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:22,118
- Really? What?
- Um, you go.

374
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:23,686
- No, you go.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

375
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,280
- Babe, let me go.
- Okay, go.

376
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:28,040
Guess who got moved up
to the second floor?

377
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,758
Oh God, that is so great!
I am so proud of you.

378
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,805
- Oh, then it was meant to be.
- What's meant to be? What's your news?

379
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:38,957
I've been feeling
really funky all day

380
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:41,925
- and you're not gonna believe this.
- I'm not gonna believe what?

381
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:44,202
- Tell me! What? What?
- Okay. I think I might be...

382
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:47,604
- Pregnant.
- Yes!

383
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:53,116
Oh, but how can that be, 'cause we--
that can't be-- we just--

384
00:23:53,207 --> 00:23:56,324
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

385
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:58,796
Where's there a trashcan?
Where's there a trashcan?

386
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:11,206
- Is that normal?
- No.

387
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:14,518
And what's worse,
it's not covered by insurance.

388
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:19,399
กำ Baby face กำ

389
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:21,125
กำ You've got
the cutest little กำ

390
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:23,163
- กำ Baby face. กำ
- Mm-hmm!

391
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:25,636
- He goes here, he comes running...
- กำ There's not another one กำ

392
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:29,117
- กำ Could take your place กำ
-...and bam, in his face.

393
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,720
กำ Baby face กำ

394
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:33,446
- กำ My poor heart is jumpin'. กำ
- Honey, that's our baby!

395
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:35,085
กำ You sure have
started something. กำ

396
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:38,239
กำ Ah, freak out! กำ

397
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:41,524
กำ When I play the maracas
I go chic-chicky-boom กำ

398
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,677
กำ Chic-chicky-boom กำ

399
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:46,235
กำ Baby face กำ

400
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:48,158
กำ I'm up in heaven กำ

401
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:50,715
- กำ When I'm in your fond embrace. กำ
- Hello, in there.

402
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:52,604
- Wow.
- What?

403
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:55,042
- l-I think my water just broke.
- กำ I didn't need a shove กำ

404
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,924
- กำ 'Cause I just fell in love... กำ
- Really?

405
00:24:57,007 --> 00:25:00,124
- It's a boy.
- กำ With your pretty baby กำ

406
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,038
กำ Pretty baby กำ

407
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:06,245
กำ Face! กำ

408
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:08,204
Oh, Alvey.

409
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:12,518
Say hello to your son.

410
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:16,480
Uh, hello there, son.

411
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,398
I've been waiting
to meet you

412
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:20,205
for nine months now.

413
00:25:22,847 --> 00:25:25,600
Whoa. He's got
a killer grip.

414
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:28,042
But Dad counteracts
with his Pinky of Doom.

415
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:34,001
Hey, do you know
who I am?

416
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:35,679
I'm your dad.

417
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:41,958
Loki!

418
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,004
There was a baby

419
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:50,601
born of the mask!

420
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:03,036
Damn!
Where's my mask?!

421
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:05,277
Sir, y-you're gonna
have to pay for that.

422
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:13,397
The advertisement
said they were authentic!

423
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:15,318
They are authentic.

424
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,558
They're authentic Pakistani
Norse Mythology masks.

425
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,677
Okay.
Now let me think.

426
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:27,123
What should
I turn him into?

427
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:31,758
Loki!

428
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:34,406
Dad?

429
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:36,886
Fool!

430
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,527
What in Helveti were you
about to do to this shopkeep?

431
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:41,598
- Nothing, I was just--
- Fool!

432
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,518
Don't you dare
lie to me.

433
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:46,075
You know, Thor never gave me
this kind of trouble.

434
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:48,635
Okay, here we go again
with the Thor crap.

435
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:51,366
Thor, Thor, Thor.
You know, father, I'm not like Thor.

436
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:53,324
I'm never gonna
be like Thor.

437
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:55,204
I just wish that--
can't you just

438
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:57,403
Iove me for who I am

439
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:59,682
and not for who I'm not?

440
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:02,406
No! I want you to be
more like Thor!

441
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,318
Now, I've wasted
enough time here.

442
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:06,238
I felt a tremor.

443
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:08,602
A child has been
born of the mask!

444
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:10,803
Wow. A baby's born
of the mask,

445
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:13,765
so that sort of makes me
kind of like a dad, huh?

446
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,997
- Find it!
- The baby or the mask?

447
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:17,918
Find the baby

448
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:20,157
and you will
find the mask.

449
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:22,124
Right.

450
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,644
Tonya, have you
seen Otis?

451
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:29,604
He's in his
new doghouse!

452
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,644
Who's a happy baby?

453
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:34,285
Who's a happy baby?

454
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,358
Let's blow up
another one.

455
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:40,637
You like these, huh?
They're pretty!

456
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,558
Honey, honey, honey,
just a second ago,

457
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:45,480
he was counting the balloons.
He held up five fingers.

458
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,398
That's great, hon.
I gotta go.

459
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:50,081
Daniel brought in Chad
to backstab me-- oh, I mean help me--

460
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,317
and I gotta get to work
before he helps me out of a job.

461
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:54,238
Hey.

462
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:56,318
What do you think,
Double A?

463
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:59,285
Would you watch this, huh? Hey hon,
I know I've asked like a million times,

464
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:02,165
but you happen to see that mask I was
looking for, you know the wooden one--

465
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,807
Okay, a billion times, and no.
Why do you need it so badly?

466
00:28:04,887 --> 00:28:07,606
I don't need it.
Who said I need it? Don't need it.

467
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,518
- Bye.
- Bye.

468
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:11,598
Bye. Say "Bye, Daddy."
Bye bye.

469
00:28:11,687 --> 00:28:14,485
Bye bye. Here.
You want another one?

470
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,398
Okay, watch,
watch, watch.

471
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:51,442
"l want you to be
more like Thor."

472
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:53,358
Oh, what a jerk.

473
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:55,677
Oh hey!
It's my ear, nose and throat guy.

474
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,598
Odin thinks
he's so great.

475
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:59,678
Hello! No one even
worships you anymore.

476
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,439
I could have
been a doctor

477
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:03,518
if the SAT weren't
so culturally biased.

478
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:06,724
Now, let's see. Oh, "lnfectious
Diseases," that always cracks me up.

479
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:08,559
Maternity ward.

480
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,638
Okay, first I find
the magic baby,

481
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:13,400
then downstairs to the cafeteria
for some Jell-O brick.

482
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,797
Who do you have to sting to get some
answers in this place?

483
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:18,400
Bingo!

484
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:20,318
All right,
here we go.

485
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,238
Buckle up.

486
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,318
Oh, hold on tight.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

487
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:26,238
Okay, baby, this
is gonna hurt you

488
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:28,079
more than it's
gonna hurt me.

489
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:30,964
Ah!

490
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:44,601
Okay, let's start with...

491
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:46,803
uh, July 27th.

492
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:50,435
Babies born on that day.

493
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:53,041
Oh, my. Why are there
so many babies born?

494
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:03,523
- Who are you?
- You.

495
00:30:03,607 --> 00:30:05,484

518
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,801
- It's okay, baby. I got him.
- Okay.

519
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:41,443
Tim.
Tim.

520
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,166
- Okay, it's my turn.
- No, no. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

521
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:46,124
- It's-- it's my turn?
- He's asleep. He's asleep.

522
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:48,038
But, baby, can you go in
late to work today?

523
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:51,483
My office just called. Um, they're
sending me to New York for a week.

524
00:31:57,087 --> 00:32:00,284
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm-- I'm sorry, Daniel.

525
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,835
My wife's gotta go out of town
for work. It's just a week,

526
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:04,724
but I have to take care
of the baby.

527
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:07,037
Hey, you gotta do the kid
thing, I understand.

528
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:10,358
Just unfortunate timing.
The network called,

529
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:13,280
they want to see our green guy
thing by the end of the week,

530
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:16,040
but I'll just put
Chad on it.

531
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:20,164
- I'm on it.
- What?

532
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:22,078
I said I need to be home,
as in my house,

533
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,998
but I didn't say
I couldn't work.

534
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:25,918
Line up the pitch.
I'm on it,

535
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,884
and I won't let
you down.

536
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:33,037
Cool. Try to give it that spark I saw
at the Halloween party.

537
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:34,799
Okay.

538
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:37,082
I left all the phone numbers
on the refrigerator

539
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,522
and you need to give him a bath
before he goes to bed,

540
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:42,644
but don't get any water in his ears,
'cause he freaks out a little bit.

541
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,195
Um, and if he gets cranky,
you just put him in his car seat

542
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:48,324
and play the Baby Mozart CD, but don't
just pop him in front of the TV;,

543
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:50,238
it's gonna
make him stupid.

544
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:52,204
Um, uh, if you feel
like you're drowning,

545
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:54,642
just go see Betty down the
street. She has like 10 kids.

546
00:32:54,727 --> 00:32:56,797
- Honey? Do I have to mash his bananas?
- Yeah?

547
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,400
- l-- l--
- Okay, you're gonna be fine.

548
00:32:58,487 --> 00:32:59,761
Can I say goodbye?

549
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:05,356
Mommy loves you
so much.

550
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:07,836
Okay.

551
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:09,758
And Mommy loves you too.

552
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:11,326
- Mommy, I can't do this.
- Huh? You can.

553
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,760
- I can't.
- You can.

554
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:14,963
Mommy. Honey, take him.

555
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:17,003
- Bye.
- Honey, take him.

556
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:18,566
- I love you.
- Honey, take him.

557
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:20,478
Bye.

558
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,444
Bye.

559
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:35,324
Okay.
All right, Alvey.

560
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:38,160
Okay. All right.
We're gonna have a good time.

561
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:41,205
Here we go.
Come on. Yes.

562
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,039
Look at the pretty colors.

563
00:33:44,327 --> 00:33:46,397
Oh, look! Ah, ee.

564
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,562
Fun, right?

565
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:53,923
Look at me!
I'm happy, I'm... happy.

566
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:09,398
Okay.

567
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:12,565
Okay, buddy,

568
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:14,558
it's just you
and me this morning

569
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:17,445
and we're gonna
have fun and gonna play.

570
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:19,404
You excited?
Okay.

571
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:24,841
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy. Can you get down here now?

572
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:27,361
- Daniel's asking for you.
- No, I can't come in right now.

573
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:30,041
- I'm stuck here with my kid.
- You'd better think of something.

574
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:32,482
He wants to see your drawings
before the pitch on Friday.

575
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:35,604
All right. I'll do the drawings now
and I'll fax 'em over after lunch.

576
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:37,564
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

577
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:40,320
Hey, pal.

578
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:44,036
Daddy's got a teensy-weensy bit
of work to do,

579
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:45,958
so can you be a good
boy and let him?

580
00:34:57,327 --> 00:34:59,045
Hello?

581
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:02,881
- Honey, hey!
- Hey, hon, how you doin'?

582
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,606
So, how are you
and Alvey doing?

583
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,723
Oh, we're doing fine.
Yeah, we're doing great.

584
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,923
Two little peas in a pod.
How's your thing going?

585
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,440
Good. Uh, he loved
the comps,

586
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,438
so now we just gotta rush
it all into production.

587
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:15,358
So, how's Alvey?

588
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,278
Is he eating?
How's he sleeping?

589
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:19,437
Hold on, hon.
Somebody wants to talk to you.

590
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:22,485
Hi! How's my little
womping wompet?

591
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:25,286
Oh, I miss you. I just want to kiss you
and kiss you and kiss you!

592
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,676
Okay, hon.
Yeah, he loves you too.

593
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:30,122
- Hurry home. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

594
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:31,606
Aww.

595
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:33,962
Well, isn't it great

596
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:35,526
that her work
is going so well?

597
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:39,077
- Ma?
- Yes. Ma and her career are just--

598
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:42,964
- Did you say ma?
- Mama.

599
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:44,878
Oh my God.
You said mama!

600
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:46,798
Well, can you say "dad"

601
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:49,447
- or "da-da?"
- Mommy.

602
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:53,720
That's great!
You're doing great!

603
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:56,799
but come on,
say "da-da". Da-da

604
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:59,560
Mother.

605
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:07,238
Timmy Tyler,
are you my mask baby?

606
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:21,037
- Yes?
- Good afternoon!

607
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:22,879
- May I come in?
- Ah--

608
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:25,162
What a lovely abode.
Oh my, and such a lush carpet.

609
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:27,078
You're exactly
the kind of person

610
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,442
the Vacuummeister 3000
was invented for!

611
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:30,926
Well, if I don't
clean up, no one will.

612
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:34,556
That is why you need
the Vacuummeister 3000!

613
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:36,877
It has dual sweeps,
durable airpaths,

614
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:38,719
jiggle control, multi-Teflon
coated filtering

615
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:40,126
and it's built
with a direct-drive design

616
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:42,721
that is so powerful,
it sucks the dirt

617
00:36:42,807 --> 00:36:44,286
off the dirt!

618
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:47,484
- Is that safe?
- Allow me to demonstrate.

619
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:49,398
- Oh, don't you need to plug it in?
- No.

620
00:36:52,007 --> 00:36:54,601
This is a terrible
demonstration.

621
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:07,040
Hello, you little...
ugly thing.

622
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:09,277
Let's see if you're
the one, hmm?

623
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:15,206
Bend. Morph!

624
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:16,925
Shape shift.

625
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:18,884
Well, do something
for Odin's sake.

626
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:30,927
No!

627
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:34,602
I think it's time to introduce you
to man's best friend.

628
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:37,724
And I don't
mean you, Otis.

629
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:39,638
Okay.

630
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:41,558
Mommy doesn't want me
to do this,

631
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:44,161
but what Mommy doesn't
know won't hurt her.

632
00:37:44,247 --> 00:37:46,522
-...sour cream and onion...
- Oh, look.

633
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:53,045
Hey, wait a minute.

634
00:37:53,127 --> 00:37:55,561
We don't like
your attitude!

635
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:58,115
Keep an eye
on him, will ya?

636
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:06,323

638
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:11,758

without Pebbles.

639
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,804
Bam.

640
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:49,600

772
00:51:59,847 --> 00:52:01,758
Okay.

773
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:04,884
Uh, take a look at this.

774
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:07,037
Hey, what a cute
little baby.

775
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:09,038
- Oh, of course!
- Mind if I take a look at him?

776
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,004
No, go ahead.
I don't care.

777
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:14,399
Come on.
Do something crazy.

778
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:16,284
Yeah, do
something crazy!

779
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,439
Crap! Huh-uh, huh-uh.

780
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:21,404
Damn it. This isn't
the right one either.

781
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:25,124
Hey!
What are you doing?

782
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:27,084
Uh, I left your package
in the foyer.

783
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:33,158
Do I have a package? Okay.

784
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,683
Oh well.

785
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:47,878
What happened?

786
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:52,201
You did this to me.
I know what you're doing.

787
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:55,798
You're trying
to drive me crazy.

788
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:57,445
You're a cunning
little mastermind

789
00:52:57,527 --> 00:52:59,995
who will stop at
nothing until I go

790
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:01,964
completely insane.

791
00:53:03,887 --> 00:53:05,605
Well, come on.

792
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:08,201
Start dancing again.

793
00:53:09,327 --> 00:53:12,239
Start screwing
with my mind!

794
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:14,682
Start, huh?
Come on!

795
00:53:19,527 --> 00:53:21,802
Why aren't you
screwing with my mind?

796
00:53:25,647 --> 00:53:27,524
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

797
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:29,438
Maybe I am just
going crazy.

798
00:53:29,527 --> 00:53:32,041
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

799
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:33,958
Maybe I am just going crazy.

800
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:37,403
Maybe I am
just going--

801
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:57,406
That's it, buddy.
First I'm taking you to a pediatrician,

802
00:53:57,487 --> 00:53:59,364
then I'm taking you
to an exorcist.

803
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:12,161
Who are you?!

804
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:14,078
Oh my G--

805
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,239
my son is the devil.
My son is the devil.

806
00:54:17,327 --> 00:54:20,205
Oh my Odin,
it is him.

807
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:24,802
We're just going to have
a nice little drive,

808
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,764
while Daddy has
a nervous breakdown.

809
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:30,562
Please leave a message.

810
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:32,877
Tonya, it's Betty.
You said I should keep an eye out

811
00:54:32,967 --> 00:54:34,764
and call you if there
are any problems?

812
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:36,485
I think there's a problem.

813
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,164
No parking there.

814
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,125
That's a handicapped zone!

815
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:57,004
Hey! Sir?

816
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:03,484
Hey, wait!

817
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:06,523
Stop! You!

818
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:09,644
Hey!

819
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,318
What is it?

820
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:16,324
- Ah!
- Okay, where is the mask?

821
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:18,716
- What?
- The mask. My mask. Where is it?

822
00:55:18,807 --> 00:55:20,320
What are you talking
about? Who are you?

823
00:55:20,407 --> 00:55:21,965
I am Loki, God of Mischief.

824
00:55:22,047 --> 00:55:24,607
Yeah, and I'm Tim, God of Crazy
Babyland. Will you get out of the way?

825
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:26,086
That baby is born
of the mask-- my mask.

826
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:28,123
- Now, where is it?!
- Born of the mask-- what?

827
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:32,885
Oh, so that explains why
he could pee like that!

828
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:36,162
But wait a minute.
This is my baby.

829
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:38,681
I don't care about that.
Just give me my mask!

830
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:40,598
- I don't know where it is.
- Oh really?

831
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:42,564
Maybe this will
jog your memory!

832
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:48,881
- Loki!!
- Dad?!

833
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:51,037
I've warned you! You've
left me no other choice.

834
00:55:51,127 --> 00:55:53,641
I don't have time for this.
Look, Dad, there's Balder.

835
00:56:19,927 --> 00:56:22,395
- Just give me the mask.
- I don't have it.

836
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:26,404
I think my dog ate it.

837
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:28,955
That is the oldest
excuse in the book,

838
00:56:29,047 --> 00:56:32,323
and I've read some really,
really old books.

839
00:56:32,407 --> 00:56:35,877
But if you want
to do this the hard way...

840
00:56:35,967 --> 00:56:38,117
so be it.

841
00:56:58,247 --> 00:57:00,044
Oh, you're good.

842
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,798
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

843
00:57:09,487 --> 00:57:11,717
You really are a chip
off the old block.

844
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:15,356
But I don't have time for this.
Prepare to feel my true power!

845
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:28,682
Loki!

846
00:57:32,647 --> 00:57:34,603
You have defied me

847
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:37,076
for the last time.

848
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:38,680
I've had it up
to here with you!

849
00:57:38,767 --> 00:57:41,406
Dad, please listen to me.
You're holding the baby.

850
00:57:41,487 --> 00:57:45,924
Silence!
You have left me no choice.

851
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:47,963
- Listen, listen--
- You are hereby stripped

852
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,766
of your immortal powers
and forever banished

853
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,997
to the land of mortals.

854
00:57:53,087 --> 00:57:55,317
No! Please, hear me out.
That baby--

855
00:58:06,807 --> 00:58:09,321
Whoa.

856
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:28,604
- Pretty.
- Whoa.

857
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:32,043
Whoa.

858
00:58:34,007 --> 00:58:36,316
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you, homes?

859
00:58:36,407 --> 00:58:38,363
Your pitch meeting
is starting right now.

860
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:41,041
Um, I just met Green.

861
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:43,561
- Loki.
- Snap out of it.

862
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:45,524
Where are you?
I'll pick you up.

863
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:52,763
What's the deal, Tim?
I get you a network pitch,

864
00:58:52,847 --> 00:58:54,838
and you repay me by showing up
20 minutes late

865
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:56,519
Iooking like an escaped
mental patient?

866
00:58:56,607 --> 00:58:58,438
Andwith a kid?

867
00:58:58,527 --> 00:59:00,757
Huh?

868
00:59:00,847 --> 00:59:02,758
This is Tim Avery.

869
00:59:02,847 --> 00:59:04,678
He created
the character,

870
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:07,076
so why don't I just let him
tell you more about it?

871
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:09,044
Tim?

872
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:17,358
Tim?

873
00:59:21,447 --> 00:59:23,324
Guys, I could walk.

874
00:59:23,407 --> 00:59:25,921
I-I guess he didn't
like the pitch.

875
00:59:26,007 --> 00:59:29,443
I just--
I wanna get all my stuff.

876
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,883
Tim?

877
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:34,798
Pick up the phone!

878
00:59:34,887 --> 00:59:36,718
Tim!

879
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,196
Betty just called.
She's completely freaked out!

880
00:59:39,287 --> 00:59:42,597
Oh, God. Call me the second
you get this message.

881
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:48,404
Hey, it's me.

882
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:50,318
Uh, got your message.

883
00:59:50,407 --> 00:59:52,637
Well, things are
really great here.

884
00:59:52,727 --> 00:59:56,003
Uh, me and Alvey got chased
by a guy named Loki.

885
00:59:56,087 --> 00:59:58,237
Well, that's
not important.

886
00:59:59,687 --> 01:00:01,917
I pitched, uh,
my show today,

887
01:00:02,007 --> 01:00:03,838
and, um...

888
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:05,804
I got fired.

889
01:00:09,007 --> 01:00:10,884
Yeah.

890
01:00:10,967 --> 01:00:12,798
Um...

891
01:00:12,887 --> 01:00:14,718
but Alvey pooped,

892
01:00:14,807 --> 01:00:16,684
which is good, and, uh...

893
01:00:18,607 --> 01:00:20,723
and Alvey saved me.

894
01:00:21,727 --> 01:00:24,161
It was amazing.

895
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:26,078
But, uh, uh,
the main thing is, uh,

896
01:00:26,167 --> 01:00:28,556
we're totally fine.
Everything's great.

897
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:31,207
Um, better than fine,
actually.

898
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:33,005
Alvey's great.

899
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,918
I love you.

900
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,884
Okay, bye.

By Kylvie,
King of Svitjod,

912
01:02:42,647 --> 01:02:45,923
Houthedy
and Yppor.

913
01:02:46,007 --> 01:02:50,478
I summon thee,
God of Gunningap

914
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,444
- Nifleheim, Kvelge--
- Tim?

915
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:58,526
Tim? Is that you?

916
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:00,165
Tim!

917
01:03:04,727 --> 01:03:08,197
Kvelgemir!

918
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:19,204
Who summons Odin,

919
01:03:19,287 --> 01:03:21,278
- Allfather of the gods?
- Shh!

920
01:03:21,367 --> 01:03:23,597
- G-- Loki?!
- Shh!

921
01:03:23,687 --> 01:03:25,757
- You'll wake the baby.
- Oh, sorry.

922
01:03:25,847 --> 01:03:29,123
Loki, is that you?

923
01:03:29,207 --> 01:03:30,720
Tim.

924
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,126
What are you doing
in there?

925
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:34,243
You did
the conjuring ceremony

926
01:03:34,327 --> 01:03:36,158
- by yourself?
- I pay attention.

927
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:38,841
- Sometimes.
- But you don't have the mask.

928
01:03:38,927 --> 01:03:41,760
- Well, yeah, that's why l--
- Rules are rules, Loki!!

929
01:03:41,847 --> 01:03:43,485
And I specifically-- ow!

930
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:46,764
Could you just stop lecturing me
for one minute and listen?!

931
01:03:47,927 --> 01:03:49,838
I found the baby.
He's right there.

932
01:03:50,887 --> 01:03:52,798
- That child is strong.
- Mmm.

933
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:56,004
Very strong.

934
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:59,204
I had him before.
I was this close,

935
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:01,437
but you took my powers
and they got away.

936
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:03,358
So, please, father,

937
01:04:03,447 --> 01:04:05,278
give me my powers

938
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:07,562
and I will
give you the mask.

939
01:04:11,407 --> 01:04:13,284
Very well.

940
01:04:13,367 --> 01:04:15,676
Your resourcefulness
pleases me,

941
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:18,076
and your mother says
we should be trying

942
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:19,998
"positive reinforcement,"

943
01:04:20,087 --> 01:04:21,918
whatever the Helveti
that is.

944
01:04:22,007 --> 01:04:24,760
So, as a reward,

945
01:04:24,847 --> 01:04:28,123
I shall grant you
a reprieve.

946
01:04:28,207 --> 01:04:31,244
You have until
the sands have fallen.

947
01:04:31,327 --> 01:04:33,158
Oh, hey, hey.
Wait, wait. Hang on.

948
01:04:33,247 --> 01:04:34,839
- Hmm?
- I want to sync up.

949
01:04:34,927 --> 01:04:37,521
Ready... now!

950
01:04:39,887 --> 01:04:42,685
Don't disappoint me, Loki.
Use your powers wisely

951
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:45,406
and complete your task.
This truly is

952
01:04:45,487 --> 01:04:47,364
your final chance!

953
01:05:09,487 --> 01:05:11,205
Tim.

954
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:13,164
What's going on
up there?

955
01:05:14,687 --> 01:05:16,598
Tim Avery, what are
you doing in there?

956
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,158
Hmm.
Nosy neighbors.

957
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:26,606
Ah--ah--choo!

958
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,484
- Guess who?
- No! Ah!

959
01:05:48,447 --> 01:05:50,324
Tim, snap out of it!

960
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:52,602
Baby?

961
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:55,520
- Is that you?
- Of course it's me.

962
01:05:55,607 --> 01:05:57,438
What are you
doing up so late?

963
01:05:57,527 --> 01:05:59,563
- And where's Alvey?
- Seriously.

964
01:05:59,647 --> 01:06:01,638
Is that really you?

965
01:06:01,727 --> 01:06:03,399
No, you idiot.

966
01:06:03,487 --> 01:06:06,923
Oh God.
Ah-- what-- l--

967
01:06:09,567 --> 01:06:11,444
Oh Jeez.

968
01:06:11,527 --> 01:06:13,358
Bro, listen.

969
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:16,280
I'm a god.
I can shape shift.

970
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:18,198
I can create stuff
out of nothingness.

971
01:06:18,287 --> 01:06:20,198
I can alter
the fabric of reality,

972
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,836
so, please, quit being
a knucklehead.

973
01:06:23,927 --> 01:06:26,441
- What do you want from us?
- Oh, don't worry.

974
01:06:26,527 --> 01:06:28,802
I'm not gonna
hurt you...

975
01:06:28,887 --> 01:06:30,718
yet!

976
01:06:30,807 --> 01:06:32,957
This baby was born
out of the mask,

977
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:35,038
and I want
my mask back!

978
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:37,322
Meet me in exactly
one hour.

979
01:06:41,967 --> 01:06:45,642
So you find the mask
and meet me at-- hmm.

980
01:06:45,727 --> 01:06:49,003
Where shall we meet?
Um, how about Red Lobster?

981
01:06:49,087 --> 01:06:51,521
It's always so difficult getting a table
there, especially on Fridays

982
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,279
- when they do that special.
- There's a wick burning.

983
01:06:53,367 --> 01:06:55,278
Well, how about we meet
in an alley in the city?

984
01:06:55,367 --> 01:06:57,198
- There's a wick--
- Met at one before.

985
01:06:57,287 --> 01:06:59,198
- Sure, it's a little cliche...
- Sir, your--

986
01:06:59,287 --> 01:07:02,085
but it's not so cliche that I think
to myself, "Wow, that's too cliche!"

987
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:05,079
- But-- it-- it--
- Meet me in that alley within the hour,

988
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:06,885
with the mask,

989
01:07:06,967 --> 01:07:10,437
if you ever want to see
your little monster again.

990
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,360
No!

991
01:07:15,527 --> 01:07:19,042
Alvey! No!

992
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:36,796
What--
Tim?

993
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:40,444
Tim?!

994
01:07:40,527 --> 01:07:42,404
Alvey?!

995
01:07:44,047 --> 01:07:45,924
Oh God. Tim!

996
01:07:46,007 --> 01:07:48,043
What are you--
what are you--

997
01:07:50,447 --> 01:07:52,324
Tim.
What are you doing?

998
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:54,284
What are you doing?

999
01:07:58,447 --> 01:08:00,517
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Get off of me!

1000
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:04,156
Get out of there, Loki!
Where's my son, you mongrel from hell?

1001
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:12,997
Tim! Ah!

1002
01:08:13,087 --> 01:08:14,964
Tonya?!

1003
01:08:17,847 --> 01:08:20,884
Tonya!
Oh, it's really you.

1004
01:08:20,967 --> 01:08:23,481
- Oh my God.
- Oh God, I'm so sorry.

1005
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:26,206
Betty was right.
You have gone crazy.

1006
01:08:26,287 --> 01:08:29,006
No, I haven't.
I thought I did, but I didn't.

1007
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:32,278
Where's Alvey?

1008
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:35,324
- Okay, don't freak out.
- Where's Alvey?!

1009
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:37,159
- You're freaking out.
- Where's my baby?!

1010
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,078
- Loki t-took him.
- Took him?!

1011
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:40,998
Oh my God.
Did you call the police?!

1012
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,964
- No, l--
- Oh my God.

1013
01:08:44,047 --> 01:08:46,277
Tonya, listen!

1014
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:48,198
- This is an emergency!
- Tonya!!

1015
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:50,881
- My son is missing--
- No, Tonya, listen!

1016
01:08:50,967 --> 01:08:53,640
The police can't help us!
He's the freaking God of Mischief.

1017
01:08:53,727 --> 01:08:56,161
All he wants is his mask,
which Otis is wearing.

1018
01:08:56,247 --> 01:08:59,364
And if I can just figure
out where Otis is, I can just--

1019
01:08:59,447 --> 01:09:01,278
of course!

1020
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:04,643
Our child is missing and you're worried
about the damned dog?!

1021
01:09:04,727 --> 01:09:06,718
This is crazy!

1022
01:09:06,807 --> 01:09:08,160
See what I'm
talking about?

1023
01:09:08,247 --> 01:09:09,965
Now, you're gonna
have to trust me

1024
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:13,483
and get in the car, because I know where
Alvey is and I know how to get him back,

1025
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,398
because I know the one place
Otis the moose would go.

1026
01:09:15,487 --> 01:09:17,318
กำ And they called it กำ

1027
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:20,604
กำ Puppy love. กำ

1028
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:24,846
กำ Oh, I guess they'll
never know. กำ

1029
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:30,724
See there's this really
cute pooch Venus.

1030
01:09:30,807 --> 01:09:32,445
Otis?

1031
01:09:32,527 --> 01:09:34,722
Otis!

1032
01:09:34,807 --> 01:09:37,446
That's not Otis!
That's a green critter.

1033
01:09:37,527 --> 01:09:39,358
I'm sorry, okay?

1034
01:09:39,447 --> 01:09:42,041
I've ignored you
and I've been impatient,

1035
01:09:42,127 --> 01:09:45,164
but I need you, buddy.
Loki, that guy that made the mask?

1036
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,078
He wants it back.
He has Alvey.

1037
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:48,998
And he's a bad guy,
Otis.

1038
01:09:49,087 --> 01:09:51,396
He hates dogs.

1039
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,955
He doesn't realize that dogs
are truly man's best friend.

1040
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,878
- Huh?
- You heard me.

1041
01:09:55,967 --> 01:09:58,242
You're this man's
best friend.

1042
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,636
But Alvey's my son

1043
01:10:00,727 --> 01:10:03,082
which sort of makes you
like his big brother.

1044
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:06,318
And when he grows up,
he's gonna be your bestest friend.

1045
01:10:07,567 --> 01:10:09,444
But right now,
he needs you

1046
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:12,200
and he needs that mask.

1047
01:10:15,687 --> 01:10:17,598
All right.

1048
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:28,003
So, I guess you're

1049
01:10:28,087 --> 01:10:29,964
kinda cute, huh?

1050
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,604
Um, can you, like,

1051
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,518
do anything you want,
like me?

1052
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,484
I mean, can you
do this?

1053
01:10:42,807 --> 01:10:44,479
Wow.

1054
01:10:44,567 --> 01:10:46,398
Well, look at you!

1055
01:10:46,487 --> 01:10:48,364
You're just a little
outlaw, ain't you?

1056
01:10:56,527 --> 01:11:00,202
Okay, hombre. Let's see how tough
your rawhide can be.

1057
01:11:17,447 --> 01:11:19,517
Gotcha.

1058
01:11:24,527 --> 01:11:26,722
I like it!

1059
01:11:26,807 --> 01:11:29,275
So, you like games, huh?

1060
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:31,198
Well you'd better watch out

1061
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,926
'cause I've got a game
that no one can beat me at.

1062
01:11:35,727 --> 01:11:37,365
Super Twister!

1063
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:41,004
It's just around
the corner, right here.

1064
01:11:41,087 --> 01:11:42,918
Here we go.

1065
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,680
กำ Come on, baby กำ

1066
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:48,600
กำ Let's do the twist กำ

1067
01:11:48,687 --> 01:11:51,281
กำ Come on, baby กำ

1068
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:53,198
กำ Let's do the twist กำ

1069
01:11:53,287 --> 01:11:55,118
กำ Take me
by my little hand... กำ

1070
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:57,038
Isn't this fun?

1071
01:11:57,127 --> 01:11:59,004
กำ And go like this กำ

1072
01:12:00,087 --> 01:12:03,284
- กำ Ee-oh, twist. กำ
- Hi.

1073
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:05,005
กำ Baby, baby, twist กำ

1074
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:09,558
กำ Whoo, yeah. กำ

1075
01:12:09,647 --> 01:12:12,036
- Ah!
- กำ Just like this กำ

1076
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,005
กำ Come on, little miss กำ

1077
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:18,682
กำ And do the twist. กำ

1078
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,997
- No, that's cheating.
- กำ Let's all do it. กำ

1079
01:12:23,847 --> 01:12:25,360
Whoa!

1080
01:12:25,447 --> 01:12:27,324
Whoa!

1081
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:34,124
No fair! That crash
threw me. Rematch!

1082
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,963
Okay, you give me Alvey,

1083
01:12:45,047 --> 01:12:46,765
and the mask is yours.

1084
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:04,678
I can't let go.
I've grown attached.

1085
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,598
- Alvey!
- Hey, we had a deal!

1086
01:13:06,687 --> 01:13:09,326
I'm the God of friggin' Mischief,
what did you expect?

1087
01:13:41,087 --> 01:13:42,964
- Huh.
- Hey, Loki.

1088
01:13:43,047 --> 01:13:44,878
Honey, you look hot.

1089
01:13:45,887 --> 01:13:48,037
Give me back my son!

1090
01:13:48,127 --> 01:13:50,004
Um... no.

1091
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:54,995
Honey, I think
it's time we trade up.

1092
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:14,165
Buckle up, baby.

1093
01:14:22,287 --> 01:14:24,164
Listen to Loki, kid.

1094
01:14:24,247 --> 01:14:27,717
Dads are overrated
and I speak from experience.

1095
01:14:29,447 --> 01:14:32,200
Ah, there's nothing
like a Sunday drive.

1096
01:14:33,967 --> 01:14:36,356
You wanna have some fun,
kid, you stick with me.

1097
01:14:48,487 --> 01:14:50,921
All right. It's time
to lose them for good.

1098
01:14:58,487 --> 01:15:01,285
Oh, look out,
look out, look out!

1099
01:15:02,607 --> 01:15:04,199
Yahoo!

1100
01:15:12,647 --> 01:15:14,444
Whoa!!

1101
01:15:15,687 --> 01:15:18,918
Hey, babe, look.
No hands. I'm kidding.

1102
01:15:19,007 --> 01:15:20,520
Let's just
finish this.

1103
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:26,447
Now, where did he go?

1104
01:15:27,447 --> 01:15:29,324
- Hmm.
- Uh, honey?

1105
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,523
I think, maybe, there?

1106
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:49,244
And here he is,folks,

1107
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:52,364
the failure of Fringe City,

1108
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:57,441
Yes, it's
Tim "No-win" Avery!

1109
01:15:57,527 --> 01:16:00,087
Tim, it's Alvey.
I'm gonna go get him.

1110
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:02,044
Kick his can, honey.

1111
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:18,884
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

1112
01:16:21,687 --> 01:16:23,678
Hi, baby.
Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

1113
01:16:23,767 --> 01:16:27,043
Oh, yeah? Well, jump
like a grasshopper

1114
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:29,595
and stink like a skunk!

1115
01:16:31,007 --> 01:16:32,963
Caught me
with my mouth open!

1116
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,163
You can't fight me
if you're locked in a trunk.

1117
01:16:35,247 --> 01:16:36,646
Huh?

1118
01:16:40,807 --> 01:16:43,082
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1119
01:16:53,247 --> 01:16:55,920
Let's get out of this dump.
Come on.

1120
01:16:56,007 --> 01:16:58,999
And Loki said, "Let there
be a brick wall!"

1121
01:16:59,087 --> 01:17:01,647
And there was!

1122
01:17:02,887 --> 01:17:04,605
Okay!

1123
01:17:04,687 --> 01:17:07,360
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

1124
01:17:09,807 --> 01:17:12,685
Say hello to my
little friend!

1125
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:20,644
Tim! Tim!

1126
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:29,125
Here's Loki!

1127
01:17:33,327 --> 01:17:35,238
Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim,
T-T-T-T-T--

1128
01:17:47,727 --> 01:17:49,445
Wait.

1129
01:17:49,527 --> 01:17:50,880
This is a waste
of time.

1130
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:53,083
We're evenly-matched
opponents.

1131
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,238
I think we should
let the kid decide.

1132
01:17:58,327 --> 01:18:00,682
Why, that's
a swell idea.

1133
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:10,239
Alvey, this is
your decision.

1134
01:18:11,247 --> 01:18:13,283
- Pick me, pick me!
- Alvey?

1135
01:18:13,367 --> 01:18:18,043
- I'm your real dad!
- Come on, you little devil. Let's play!

1136
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:21,085
- Come on, Alvey.
- Alvey.

1137
01:18:27,047 --> 01:18:28,321
Alvey?

1138
01:18:28,407 --> 01:18:30,967
- Yeah, that's right.
- Tim!

1139
01:18:31,047 --> 01:18:33,561
Son.

1140
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:51,325
Alvey,
look at me.

1141
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:53,523
It's your dad.

1142
01:18:53,607 --> 01:18:55,404
There's no more
superpowers.

1143
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:58,563
I know at first
I was kind of a jerk.

1144
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:02,721
I didn't know
how to handle a son,

1145
01:19:02,807 --> 01:19:05,401
but you helped me
grow up.

1146
01:19:05,487 --> 01:19:07,478
And I want
to repay you

1147
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:09,444
by helping you
grow up.

1148
01:19:11,087 --> 01:19:12,839
I love you.

1149
01:19:16,407 --> 01:19:18,443
Come on.

1150
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:25,485
- Da-da.
- Oh, Alvey.

1151
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:27,922
It's my son.

1152
01:19:30,127 --> 01:19:32,038
Yes.

1153
01:19:34,927 --> 01:19:37,839
I just wanted
a friend.

1154
01:20:20,767 --> 01:20:22,758
Push! Push!

1155
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:38,879
Huh?

1156
01:21:11,527 --> 01:21:14,724
Off the throne.
He's off the throne. That's not good.

1157
01:21:14,807 --> 01:21:16,445
Your time is up, son.

1158
01:21:16,527 --> 01:21:19,837
As expected, you failed
in your promise.

1159
01:21:19,927 --> 01:21:21,758
You failed in your quest.

1160
01:21:21,847 --> 01:21:25,681
You are, in every sense
of the word,

1161
01:21:25,767 --> 01:21:28,327
- a failure.
- And I thought your dad was mean.

1162
01:21:28,407 --> 01:21:30,238
Hey, we both knew
it would end like this, right?

1163
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:32,761
You always set me up to fail.
At least in that respect,

1164
01:21:32,847 --> 01:21:35,236
- I'm living up to your expectations.
- Silence!

1165
01:21:35,327 --> 01:21:38,399
You've brought me
much pain, Loki.

1166
01:21:40,327 --> 01:21:43,239
Right back
at you, Dad.

1167
01:21:43,327 --> 01:21:44,965
- Hey!
- Tim, no!

1168
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:47,242
Hang on just a minute,
Grizzly Adams.

1169
01:21:47,327 --> 01:21:49,887
I don't know how things work
in the god world,

1170
01:21:49,967 --> 01:21:53,164
but you're his father,
he's your son.

1171
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:56,284
And even if you banish him,
he's still gonna be your son.

1172
01:21:57,647 --> 01:22:01,925
There is nothing more important
in this entire universe

1173
01:22:02,007 --> 01:22:04,237
than your relationship
with your family,

1174
01:22:04,327 --> 01:22:05,885
especially
if you're immortal.

1175
01:22:05,967 --> 01:22:08,276
You're like 1,000,
he's like 800,

1176
01:22:08,367 --> 01:22:09,959
so you might as well
get things right now

1177
01:22:10,047 --> 01:22:12,436
and enjoy the rest
of your eternal life.

1178
01:22:13,487 --> 01:22:16,001
Here's the thing.
Just take it.

1179
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:22,560
Okay?
Loosen up.

1180
01:22:37,727 --> 01:22:39,957
Come on, son.
Let's go home.

1181
01:22:40,047 --> 01:22:41,844
- Okay?
- Okay.

1182
01:22:43,247 --> 01:22:45,158
Godspeed.

1183
01:22:49,767 --> 01:22:52,600
Maybe now, I can help you
patch things up with Mom?

1184
01:22:52,687 --> 01:22:54,279
Don't push it.

1185
01:23:09,687 --> 01:23:12,838
A baby and a dog competing
for Dad's attention--

1186
01:23:12,927 --> 01:23:15,077
I love it.

1187
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:18,716
Simple, but it's--
it's got--

1188
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:21,640
- Spark?
- Yes.

1189
01:23:21,727 --> 01:23:23,843
Where did you
get the idea?

1190
01:23:23,927 --> 01:23:28,557
Well, I just kind of quit
trying so hard and...

1191
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:32,998
the idea just
came to me.

1192
01:23:33,087 --> 01:23:35,237
It's great.

1193
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:05,958
Yay! Yay!

1194
01:24:06,047 --> 01:24:08,003
Honey, oh.

1195
01:24:08,087 --> 01:24:11,045
That was such
a good show!

1196
01:24:11,127 --> 01:24:14,597
But I think you might
need to add another character.

1197
01:24:14,687 --> 01:24:16,245
What?

1198
01:24:19,607 --> 01:24:21,643
- Really?
- Yeah.

1199
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,322
What do you think about that,
Double A?

1200
01:24:28,407 --> 01:24:30,318
A little brother
or sister?

1201
01:24:30,407 --> 01:24:32,204
How does
that sound?
