<i>"I lost no time, of course, in</i>

2
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,690
<i>"and we saw ourselves at once in</i>

3
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,114
<i>"Something must speedily be resolved</i>

4
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,737
"at last to go forth together...

5
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,200
"and seek help
in the neighboring hamlet.

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,830
"No sooner said than done.
Bare-headed as we were...

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,956
"we ran out at once in the gathering
evening and the frosty fog.

00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,751
"The hamlet lay not many
hundred yards away...

20
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,598
Audrey? Sorry.

21
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,642
Mr. Talcott's gone.

22
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,182
Okay.

23
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,410
Front desk, in case anyone shows.

24
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,712
I think you'll be waiting
a while, hon.

25
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,637
No. Didn't we call? He said he had family.

26
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,717
Yeah.

27
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,014
But they don't want to have anything
to do with him.

28
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,431
You can dump it out back.

29
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,924
Okay, take a look.

30
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,221
I interview tomorrow.

31
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,386
What about your job?

32
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,927
I had enough of that place.

33
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,769
- What happened?
- Here's your beer.

34
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,229
- Thanks.
- Sure.

35
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,857
I lost a patient today. Mr. Talcott.

36
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,108
- I'm sorry.
- You should have seen it.

37
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,689
The second he died, it was like...

38
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,404
they couldn't wait to get him out of there.

39
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,735
It's just a business to them.

40
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,532
It is a business, but at least he had you.

41
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,032
No. It's supposed to be
a business about caring.

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,828
They couldn't care less.

43
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,329
Wait. This is Terrebonne Parish.
It's the freaking swamps.

44
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,918
I get the hours I need to start
nursing school, and I get paid.

45
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,132
And I get to help somebody, my way.

46
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,717
They got gators in the swamps,
and guys missing teeth.

47
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,220
Are we dancing here, or what?

48
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,767
Cary, look.

49
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,763
This work you're doing,
are you sure it's not changing you?

50
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,855
I'm 25 years old.
What's wrong with a little change?

51
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,783
Oh, my God.

52
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,646
Hello?

53
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:47,819
Hello?

54
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,710
Now that right there
is what love is all about.

55
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,718
Old-fashioned devotion,
like what you read about.

56
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,673
You must be Caroline.

57
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,468
I'm sorry, the door was open,
so I just walked in.

58
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,227
Oh, no. It's a big house. I didn't hear you.

59
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,146
It's okay.

60
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,311
So much for getting their affairs in order.

61
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,859
I'm sorry. I'm Luke Marshall. Estate lawyer.

62
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,781
We talked on the phone.

63
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,194
Oh, right.

64
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,702
The docs figure a month maybe.
He's pretty far gone.

65
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,909
I understand.

66
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,165
His wife's having kind of
a rough time with it.

67
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,127
Most people do.

68
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,339
Violet, you have a visitor.

69
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,346
May I present Miss Caroline Ellis?

70
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,181
She works down at the hospice
in New Orleans.

71
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,473
Caroline, this is Violet Devereaux.

72
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,769
You have a lovely home.

73
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,442
I'm sorry. It's just hard.
The idea of a stranger living here--

74
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,907
I understand, really.

75
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,325
She's Old South, you know.
She thinks women still curtsey.

76
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,496
So, he can't talk at all?

77
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,247
No. Stroke pretty much paralyzed him.

78
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,666
- Which side was affected?
- Both.

79
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,382
It happened about a month ago,
up in the attic.

80
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,632
That's where she found him.

81
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,840
Ben?

82
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:18,265
You have a visitor. Meet Miss Caroline Ellis.

83
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,140
Hello, Ben. I'm Caroline.

84
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:26,688
She's not from around here.
She not going to understand my house.

85
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,938
She's from New Orleans.

86
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,276
She wasn't raised in New Orleans.
You hear how she talks?

87
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,444
- Who knows where she comes from?
- Hoboken, New Jersey.

88
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,907
What do you want a Southern accent?

89
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,076
The last one left, Violet.

90
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,951
All right.

91
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,120
But she's not going to understand the house.

92
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,498
The last girl left, huh?

93
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,127
Wait. Let me talk to her,
we can straighten things out.

94
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,256
I can't help anybody
who doesn't want my help.

95
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,508
She does want help. She's just scared.

96
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,215
Of what? Politeness?

97
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,512
No. He's the love of her life and he's dying.

98
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,142
They've been together forever.

99
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,934
She's losing her soul mate here.

100
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,599
I don't know about you, but that'd
put some sandpaper up my ass.

101
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,604
Aren't you a romantic?

102
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,731
Look.

103
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,189
The last girl quit.

104
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,485
You're the fifth interview since.
She shoots down everyone.

105
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,657
It's not personal.

106
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,364
But you being here means he's really dying.

107
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,536
He's dying whether I'm here or not.

108
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,832
What'd she mean about the house?

109
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,417
What?

110
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:34,337
She said I wouldn't understand
the house. Why'd she said that?

111
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,632
All I know is her cheques clear.

112
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,221
Look, forget it.

113
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,637
If it makes you feel any better, I'm
still looking for my dream job, too.

114
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,475
All right.

115
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,858
So if you talked to her, what would you say?

116
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,692
I'd say she could look all she wants...

117
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,401
but I doubt she'd find any better than you.

118
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,321
So she'd do well to treat you like it.

119
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,329
Okay, here are my rules. No knitting.

120
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,374
No joining a bridge club.

121
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,293
And no playing bingo.

122
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,752
Okay, good. Good rules.

123
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:16,423
I'm serious, they'll try and suck
you into their elderly ways.

124
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,799
It's less than an hour away.
I'll be back all the time.

125
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,429
Yeah, well, you better.

126
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,681
Whenever you want to talk to someone
who wasn't around for World War II.

127
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,056
Jeez, what is it with you and old people?

128
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,265
Come here.

129
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,643
He'd be proud of you. You know he would.

130
00:11:58,594 --> 00:11:59,756
Hello?

131
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,099
I need to pay for some gas.

132
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,314
Hello?

133
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,131
Is somebody back there?

134
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,188
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,030
Excuse me. I just need to pay for some gas.

136
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,837
Jesus.

137
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,017
$17 for the gas.

138
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,522
Keep the change.

139
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,858
Mrs. Devereaux?

140
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,652
I'm unpacked.

141
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,596
Hi, Ben. Remember me? I'm Caroline.

142
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,683
I'll be taking care of you for a while.

143
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,071
There's not a lot of light in here
for you, is there?

144
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,197
So you're a fan of the blues, huh?
Well, so was--

145
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,163
You have to let go.

146
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,540
Ben, you're hurting me.

147
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:18,663
Ouch.

148
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,288
There you are.

149
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,252
Time for his remedies.

150
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,798
Scoot over, child.

151
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,173
9:00 in the morning and 7:00 at night.

152
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,637
He takes his pills in powder form.
I'll show you how.

153
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,805
Be sure he drinks it all down.

154
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,804
- What's he taking?
- Oh, Coumadin and such.

155
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,395
He gets the tremors sometimes.
Don't let that frighten you.

156
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,314
And a kiss to make it taste better.

157
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:49,446
You're scrawnier than I'd hoped.
Prettier, though.

158
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,370
I bet you're all marked up, aren't you?

159
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,911
- Marked up?
- Written on.

160
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,707
I know you young people are always...

161
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,460
jabbing yourselves with ink and needles.

162
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,627
You're written on, aren't you?

163
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,628
Not where you can see.

164
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,001
Well.

165
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,301
He's to be bathed daily, his linens changed.

166
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:13,510
Don't bother with the housework.
I'm the only one that knows how.

167
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,389
How long have you two lived here?

168
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,354
Let's see.

169
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,231
We came over from Savannah in '62.

170
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,069
We bought this house
from a brother and a sister.

171
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,488
They'd inherited it a long time ago,
from their parents.

172
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,115
Lived here since they were children.

173
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,740
There they are. Martin and Grace.

174
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,080
Charming people.

175
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,292
But they fell on hard times, had to sell.

176
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,587
You keep their picture?

177
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,504
Yes. I like to pay my respects
to the memories of this house.

178
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,900
All right. Come along now.

179
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,450
This is the dining room.

180
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,285
We only use about half of the rooms.

181
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,743
The others are for Ben's antique business.

182
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:22,536
What he couldn't sell, we stored here.

183
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,583
Except for the attic.

184
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,834
That has crystal and china.

185
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:30,587
And I keep a very close account
on that, just so as you know.

186
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,342
There are more than 30 rooms in all.

187
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:40,139
In the old days, they made
a separate key for each room.

188
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,394
For the owner, they made a skeleton key.

189
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,395
This will open every door.

190
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,650
This one is yours.

191
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,397
I have mine.

192
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:54,656
Now, the pantry's right out here.

193
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,532
You know, we may have to ask you
to go into town now and then.

194
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,536
Was there a mirror here once?

195
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,788
I noticed in the bathrooms also
there are no mirrors.

196
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,962
Child, when you get as worn-out
and wrinkled as we are...

197
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,755
you don't need any reminding.

198
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,005
If you want a small one
for your own purposes...

199
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,172
that's fine with me.

200
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,048
- What'd you do with them?
- Put them away.

201
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,267
The boy tells me you don't smoke.

202
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,481
I do smoke. I smoke a lot
and I enjoy it very much.

203
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,978
I trust that won't be an issue.

204
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,148
It won't be.

205
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,692
Good. Then for the most part
just realize that...

206
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,945
I'll live here as if you're not in residence.

207
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,490
After all, we're not kin.
Are your parents still alive?

208
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:45,123
My mom left when I was little. My
dad raised me and he died last year.

209
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:48,668
Oh, my. So you cared for him as well?

210
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,749
I would have.

211
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,337
I just thought I had more time.

212
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:58,592
Yeah.

213
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,848
You think too much about the time
you have left...

214
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,433
you don't spend it living.

215
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,772
Be good to my husband.
Be good to his house.

216
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,816
Remedies at 9:00.

217
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,982
One, two, three.

218
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:36,296
You don't see gardens like this
back in New Jersey, I expect.

219
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,966
Actually, it's the Garden State.

220
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,595
I doubt that very much.

221
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,764
Nothing more glorious than a garden.

222
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,433
Gone every winter, back every spring.

223
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,734
You religious at all?

224
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,069
I try to keep an open mind.

225
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,446
That's good. That's very good.

226
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,451
Where are my trilliums?

227
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,829
Oh, fiddlesticks. Do me a blessing, child.

228
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,123
Will you run up to the attic for me?

229
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,916
I have some seed packets in a box
right next to the stairs.

230
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:06,838
What took you?

231
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,388
I'm sorry.

232
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,971
I thought the key opens everything.

233
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:15,391
The key? What key?

234
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,436
The key you gave me for the house.

235
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:20,358
There's a door in the attic
it doesn't work for.

236
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,694
Oh, no, the attic, it's never opened that.

237
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,407
- I got my Dixie-Johns.
- Why not?

238
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,906
- What's in there?
- I have no idea.

239
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,241
It's been shut ever since we moved in.

240
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:38,287
I have to get these in the ground,
because there's rain coming.

241
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,001
Mrs. Devereaux...

242
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:43,628
Ben was in the attic, wasn't he,
when he had his stroke?

243
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,009
What was he doing in there?

244
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,428
You'll have to ask him, child.

245
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,311
Be a dear and go see to him, won't you?

246
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,059
I wonder if he wouldn't like some iced tea.

247
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,949
His door was locked.

248
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:19,741
Ben!

249
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,625
Ben!

250
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:32,837
Ben!

251
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:39,095
Stop right there, Ben! Don't move!

252
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:47,978
Stop!

253
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,027
Ben!

254
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,948
Mrs. Devereaux!

255
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,369
Ben!

256
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,498
Ben, what are you doing? It's me!

257
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,088
Mother of mercy, what's he done?

258
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:15,589
He got out of the window. I thought
you said he was bedridden.

259
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:16,756
He's having spasms.

260
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,464
- Didn't you give him his remedies?
- Yes.

261
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:19,800
Did you make sure he drank them down?

262
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,011
I thought so.

263
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,306
- Ben, what'd they make you do?
- His door was locked.

264
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:26,347
Just go get the wheelchair.
We've got to get him out of this.

265
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:27,517
What about a doctor?

266
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:30,602
In the morning,
just get that wheelchair now.

267
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,240
Caroline!

268
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,458
Caroline!

269
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,465
What in damnation took you so long?

270
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,011
I came as fast as I could.

271
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:02,429
We're just going to have to double his
remedies. That's all I can think of.

272
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,971
Caroline, help me here. Help me get him.

273
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,105
Come on. That's it.

274
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,296
Where did you think you were going?

275
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,475
You're here two days and
he already tried to kill himself.

276
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:53,144
Must have some kind of
bedside manner, huh?

277
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,859
One of my many charms.

278
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:00,529
So, what exactly happened?
I came to update her will...

279
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,779
she's up with the doc, says he fell?

280
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,655
He did fall.

281
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,869
Like what, from his wheelchair?

282
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:17,253
You cannot be serious. From
up there? He fell from up there?

283
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,548
How? He can't even walk.

284
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:25,010
Please don't tell me you're quitting.
I have to start over again.

285
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:28,349
Will you shut the door?
I want to show you something.

286
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,226
You know what my mama used to say?

287
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:36,064
If a lady invites you into her room,
she probably isn't much of a lady.

288
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:40,440
Homespun Southern wisdom grows
on trees around here, doesn't it?

289
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,029
I found this in Ben's room...

290
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:44,617
last night.

291
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,493
Found what? His laundry?

292
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,244
No, it had a...

293
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,536
- There was...
- Had a what?

294
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,789
There was a... It had a...

295
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,504
Forget it.

296
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,334
I thought it...

297
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,547
I don't know what I thought.

298
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,255
I admire you.

299
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,637
You know, what you do.

300
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:09,805
Hell, I wouldn't be able
to take care of my own parents.

301
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:11,180
You'd regret it.

302
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,769
I quit college to help out
with some friends' bands.

303
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:17,687
Out all night, always on the road.

304
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:21,403
My father thought
I was throwing my life away.

305
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,030
So we didn't talk, didn't visit.

306
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,862
Stubborn and proud,
and that's how we left it.

307
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,661
You mean...

308
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,409
Yeah.

309
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:35,873
He was gone before
I even knew he was sick.

310
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,050
I guess he wanted to spare me from all this.

311
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,469
Is that so wrong?

312
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:51,054
No one should have to die alone.

313
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,270
So tell me what you were going to tell me.

314
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,561
About Ben.

315
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,281
Do you ever feel like...

316
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,908
he's asking you for help?

317
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,202
- Asking me?
- With a look or...

318
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,494
a touch.

319
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:17,710
Mr. Marshall?

320
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:21,045
Where in damnation is that boy? Caroline...

321
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,504
have you seen Mr...

322
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,590
Well...

323
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:31,307
I see the children are getting acquainted.

324
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:33,684
Now, Violet...

325
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,184
you know you're the only woman in my life.

326
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,605
I know no such things,
and remove your perspirations.

327
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,981
The doctor has departed, so I'm ready...

328
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,320
to discuss estate matters,
if you have finished...

329
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,737
soliciting your new business.

330
00:31:58,502 --> 00:31:59,581
All right.

331
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,502
Whenever you get the time.

332
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:07,392
Caroline?

333
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,606
I'm making some sweet tea.

334
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,486
Are you interested?

335
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:19,322
Caroline?

336
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:38,173
"Sacrifice."

337
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:41,264
Are you in the house?

338
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,071
Caroline?

339
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,290
You're forgetful, child.

340
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,556
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

341
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,268
<i>From the dry dust...</i>

342
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,312
<i>out of these chains...</i>

343
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,521
<i>from the devil's house.</i>

344
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:57,442
<i>It is time, Lord...</i>

345
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:59,064
<i>to take me...</i>

346
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,824
<i>from the dry dust,</i>
<i>break me from these chains.</i>

347
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:07,119
<i>Bring me from the devil's house.</i>

348
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:09,742
<i>Take me out of darkness.</i>

349
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,121
<i>Walk me out of blindness.</i>

350
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:15,707
<i>Lift me out of sadness.</i>

351
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:18,335
<i>Save me from my damned-ness.</i>

352
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,924
<i>Please, Lord.</i>

353
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:22,629
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

354
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,385
<i>Take me from the dry dust. Break me...</i>

355
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:31,474
<i>out of these chains.</i>
<i>Bring me from the devil's house.</i>

356
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,435
<i>Take me out of--</i>

357
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,651
Just a local band.

358
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,697
How about you buy me a drink?

359
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,662
Whatever it is, it's not your average attic.

360
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:54,163
She says it's been locked up
ever since they first moved in.

361
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:57,874
You found yourself a hoodoo room.

362
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:04,632
- A what?
- Hoodoo. You know what hoodoo is?

363
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:07,262
It's like voodoo, right?

364
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:10,178
Wrong. Voodoo's a religion.

365
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,765
Slaves brought it to Haiti from Africa.

366
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:15,142
You worship God, heaven and hell.

367
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:17,145
- How's hoodoo different?
- It's magic.

368
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:20,524
American folk magic.
God doesn't have much to do with it.

369
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,111
- Magic?
- Yeah.

370
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:25,529
It's part African, part European,
part Native American.

371
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:27,655
And New Orleans is its home.
It started here.

372
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:31,076
My Aunt Nola's into it.
She shops at a place in Algiers.

373
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:35,208
Look, you said the house
had a history, right?

374
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:38,079
- Hoodoo is pretty harmless.
- Harmless how?

375
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,916
It's psychological, like a lot of that stuff.

376
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:43,675
It can't hurt you if you don't believe.

377
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:47,173
So this place your aunt shops at...

378
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:49,007
Ever seen it?

379
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:54,432
It's either this street or the next one...

380
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:56,853
or the next one.

381
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:00,645
There.

382
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,818
There? That's a Laundromat.

383
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:07,030
Look, that's all I know.
That's where she goes.

384
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:11,951
So you coming in or what?

385
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:13,617
I'm not.

386
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,622
I thought you don't believe in this stuff.

387
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:16,828
I don't.

388
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,791
But I'm not just going
to mess around with it.

389
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:20,917
So, you want to go in, go ahead.

390
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:23,881
You're scared.

391
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,717
- Jill the Thrill is scared.
- Kiss my ass.

392
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:29,471
You're never going to live this down.
We come all the way out here--

393
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,097
I'm not scared.

394
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:27,693
Good night, Caroline.

395
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,526
Good night.

396
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:23,039
I told you about the mirrors.

397
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:24,247
I don't understand.

398
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,914
This is not your house.

399
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:28,542
I found them.
I needed a mirror for my bathroom--

400
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:31,882
I told you, and you heard me. No mirrors.

401
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,512
No mirrors!

402
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:40,141
I've seen the room.

403
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:45,063
- What room?
- The room you say you've never seen.

404
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:49,729
It's not locked anymore.

405
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,358
No, child, you don't know
what you've seen.

406
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:54,570
You're going to tell me right now.

407
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,569
Or I'm leaving.

408
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:09,293
You're not from the South.

409
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:12,006
You won't understand.

410
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:15,593
That room up there,
you just don't go in and...

411
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,217
throw things out of a room like that.

412
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:21,726
You leave them just where you found them.

413
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,307
The house is theirs just as much as ours.

414
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:30,859
The house is whose?
Whose things are in that room?

415
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:32,690
All right.

416
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,031
About 90 years ago...

417
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,155
there was a banker here,
his name was Thorpe.

418
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:43,077
He made his fortune cheating the poor.

419
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:46,042
He was a mean man. He was a cruel man.

420
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:49,377
It was him, and his family,
and couple of servants...

421
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:53,836
name of Mama Cecile and Papa Justify.

422
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:56,338
Sit down.

423
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,798
Now...

424
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:01,721
the way I heard it, old man Thorpe,
he didn't know...

425
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,560
that Papa Justify was
a "two-headed doctor."

426
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:10,270
He was a conjure man. So was Cecile.

427
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:13,900
- They believed in--
- Hoodoo.

428
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,360
Yeah.

429
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:22,994
That was their room.

430
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:30,962
<i>They were famous</i>
<i>all through the bayous.</i>

431
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:34,464
<i>They healed the sick</i>
<i>and they hurt the mean.</i>

432
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:38,799
"Hit a straight lick with a crooked
stick," as the coloreds say.

433
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:43,094
But old Thorpe, he just saw them as help.

434
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,139
And he worked them to the bone.

435
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:48,306
He abused them.

436
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:52,607
Until one night, as the story goes...

437
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:55,987
there was a party.

438
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:02,784
<i>It was the bank's anniversary,</i>
<i>all the big mucketymucks were here.</i>

439
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:06,120
<i>Politicians, sugar barons, riverboat tycoons.</i>

440
00:45:06,832 --> 00:45:09,667
<i>There was a lot of drinking and dancing...</i>

441
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:13,041
<i>and a couple of trysts, I'm sure.</i>

442
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:18,800
<i>And then, finally,</i>
<i>when it was time to say farewell...</i>

443
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:22,592
<i>some of the guests wanted</i>
<i>to wish goodbye to the children.</i>

444
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:26,180
<i>But nobody could find them.</i>
<i>They hadn't seen them in hours.</i>

445
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:28,973
<i>So, being all full of brandy,</i>
<i>they made it a game.</i>

446
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:31,102
<i>"Let's Find the Children."</i>

447
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,646
<i>Room after room after room.</i>

448
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,445
<i>Finally, someone heard music...</i>

449
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,154
Martin? Grace?

450
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,695
<i>...and voices and shouting...</i>

451
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:44,076
<i>up in the attic.</i>

452
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:46,242
<i>From the devil's house.</i>

453
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:48,997
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

454
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:52,042
<i>The servants were up there</i>
<i>with the children.</i>

455
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:55,543
<i>They were trying to teach them</i>
<i>how to conjure hoodoo.</i>

456
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:57,338
And take his head.

457
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:02,424
<i>Thorpe went about insane,</i>
<i>and so did the rest of the guests.</i>

458
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:07,599
<i>I mean, how long had this blasphemy</i>
<i>been going on?</i>

459
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:12,476
<i>The children said it was their</i>
<i>fault, that they'd wanted to learn.</i>

460
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:15,395
<i>But they weren't having any of that.</i>

461
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:42,050
<i>All that power and rage and insanity.</i>

462
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,562
<i>The party was over.</i>

463
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,034
It was a terrible thing.

464
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:11,367
Terrible.

465
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:18,752
Rumors got out, but no arrests, no trial.

466
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:22,382
Money had its way.

467
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:27,635
What happened to the family?

468
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:29,431
The bank went under.

469
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:33,888
Thorpe shot his wife to death,
and then turned the gun on himself.

470
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:40,355
People in the bayou say
it was Justify and Cecile's revenge.

471
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:43,488
The children stayed here till '62.

472
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:49,242
But they never, ever, told us
why that room was locked.

473
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:54,080
Or why there were no mirrors
in the whole house.

474
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:58,037
Now we know.

475
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:00,004
You know what?

476
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:05,211
You see them in the mirrors.

477
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:07,924
Who?

478
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,508
The servants.

479
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:13,433
I've gone and read
some hoodoo books, and they say...

480
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,519
- putting brick dust down'll keep harm away.
- Mrs. Devereaux.

481
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:19,517
So I made a big circle of it around
the whole house.

482
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:23,440
You can't expect me to believe
you see ghosts in your mirrors.

483
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,822
The ghosts are here now.

484
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:33,867
But whatever they did to him...

485
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:37,334
I am not going to let them do it to me.

486
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:46,216
Now you'll leave...

487
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:49,842
like all the rest of them.

488
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:53,532
That's some superstitious wife
you got there, Ben.

489
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:56,746
She thinks you have ghosts in the attic.

490
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:59,034
Spooky, huh?

491
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:01,079
Ouch.

492
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:05,124
Hold on. I'll be right back.

493
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:24,477
She says you see them in the mirrors.

494
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:28,025
Ghosts in the mirrors.

495
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:05,850
I'm sorry, Ben.

496
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,064
Ben, stop it.

497
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:16,320
Relax. I'm so...

498
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:18,619
I'm so sorry.

499
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,533
I'm so sorry.

500
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:26,459
You see them, too.

501
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:37,679
I'm going to town.

502
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,219
Shopping.

503
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:41,933
What for, Caroline?

504
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:46,770
Caroline, what for?

505
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:48,731
We'll just have to see.

506
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:34,397
He won't beat you again.

507
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,193
Mama Cynthia,
he beat me last night.

508
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:40,491
You use the potion
that I'm going to fix for you...

509
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:43,033
and it won't happen again.
I will promise you that.

510
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:45,701
- I'm scared.
- Don't be afraid.

511
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,291
Are you sure that I can do it?

512
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:48,918
I know it will. It will work.

513
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,375
Just do as I say. Don't be afraid.

514
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:54,168
It will work, and it won't happen again, ever.

515
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:57,088
Don't worry about it. He won't hit you again.

516
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:01,342
Just use this potion I mixed up.
I have a lot of things in here.

517
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:03,597
And you use it as I told you.

518
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:06,395
- Okay, I'll trust you, Mama.
- You'll do fine.

519
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:17,319
That brick dust at the door,
how does it work?

520
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,739
You lay a line down.

521
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:23,407
Nobody that means you harm can cross it.

522
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:26,534
It's how you tell who your enemies are.

523
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,832
It's like hypnotism, right?

524
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:32,915
Suggestion?

525
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:37,545
And when this stuff works, it's
because someone believes it works?

526
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:41,756
And if you thought, you know...

527
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:44,388
magic made you sick...

528
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:47,763
you might believe in a magic cure, right?

529
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,185
Even though it's all in your head.

530
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:51,896
Somebody been working roots on you.

531
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:54,651
Say I knew someone
who believed he'd been...

532
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:57,233
- Crossed.
- Crossed.

533
00:53:59,322 --> 00:54:01,695
Would he believe he could be uncrossed?

534
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:03,824
What's the nature of his condition?

535
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:06,746
He can't speak. Barely moves.
He had a stroke...

536
00:54:07,914 --> 00:54:10,287
but he seems to think
someone else made him that way.

537
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,623
And you want to know
what happened to him?

538
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:13,915
Yes.

539
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:29,184
<i>You went in there.</i>
<i>You actually went in.</i>

540
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,432
Are you out of your mind?

541
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,308
Come on. Haven't you ever heard
of psychosomatic treatment?

542
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:36,269
Yeah. But this is not that.

543
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,274
How much of a patient's recovery
depends on his believing he can?

544
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:42,321
What recovery? This is hospice.

545
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,281
You're just supposed to help this guy die.

546
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:45,945
He believes in this stuff.

547
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:47,993
So what? Who is he to you?

548
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:49,284
Forget it.

549
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:52,160
No, you forget it. He's not your dad.

550
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,875
Not this one, the last, or the one before.

551
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,167
Why are the two of you so attached?

552
00:54:57,964 --> 00:54:59,756
I'm sorry, Cary.

553
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:01,633
Just so you know,
if I'm not attached to him...

554
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:03,213
I'm abandoning him.

555
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:05,258
Attached is better.

556
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,971
I know. Cary, I'm sorry. Okay?

557
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:11,266
But would you look at yourself?

558
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:14,437
You want to be a nurse and you
just walked out of a witch doctor's.

559
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:15,981
It's not for me.

560
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,824
<i>Forecasters are calling</i>
<i>for up to a foot of rain...</i>

561
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:29,032
<i>in the coastal areas...</i>

562
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:32,496
<i>as this storm makes its way across</i>
<i>the delta, starting overnight.</i>

563
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:35,625
<i>Radar already shows</i>
<i>increasing precipitation...</i>

564
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:38,753
<i>across the coastal areas and moving</i>
<i>rather quickly to the north.</i>

565
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:42,047
<i>The main forecast concerns</i>
<i>centers around potential...</i>

566
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:48,092
Hi, Ben.

567
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:53,224
I'm going to show you something.

568
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:59,983
It's going to be our secret. You and me.

569
00:56:04,197 --> 00:56:07,068
Violet says you didn't have a stroke...

570
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:11,201
in the attic. She said some ghosts...

571
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:13,869
made you this way with a spell.

572
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,249
Is that what you think?

573
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:20,834
Because I know a spell, too, Ben.

574
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:24,424
One that makes you better.

575
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:38,727
All you have to do is believe it.

576
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:09,632
Backwards.

577
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:15,433
Cleanse this man.

578
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:18,186
Cleanse this room.

579
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:20,980
Cleanse this house.

580
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:29,653
His words have gotten lost,
lost and wandering in his mind.

581
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:32,282
Let the water run down...

582
00:57:33,161 --> 00:57:35,450
and wash away this condition.

583
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:44,294
His tongue has gotten tied,
tied and tangled in his throat.

584
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:46,964
Let the water run down...

585
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:50,550
and wash away this affliction.

586
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:57,475
Send his voice to go free.

587
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:00,644
Let the water run down...

588
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:02,060
and wash away--

589
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,870
Caroline.

590
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,715
Caroline.

591
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:34,680
It's all in your head.

592
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:38,389
Help. Help.

593
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,022
Ben, talk to me. Keep talking.

594
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:44,601
Help me.

595
00:58:46,276 --> 00:58:49,526
Help you? Help you how, Ben?

596
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:53,158
Get me out of here.

597
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:55,737
Caroline?

598
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:00,493
Get me out of here!

599
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,246
Shit!

600
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:05,375
- Caroline!
- Just a second.

601
00:59:05,462 --> 00:59:07,419
Caroline, open this door!

602
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:09,877
What are you doing to him?

603
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:12,006
Ben, why? Get out of here, why?

604
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:14,466
- Caroline!
- One second!

605
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:16,051
Caroline, open this door!

606
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:18,138
I'll help you, I promise. Just talk to me.

607
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:21,932
What happened to you in that attic?
Tell me who you're afraid of.

608
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:26,189
What have you done?

609
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:30,277
What is this?

610
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:31,607
He was...

611
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,567
- He was struggling in his sleep--
- Get away from him.

612
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:37,030
- Get away from him.
- He was struggling.

613
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:39,536
It's all right.

614
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:40,909
I brought water.

615
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,368
You were talking to him?

616
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:45,791
I was just telling him a story
to settle him down.

617
00:59:45,877 --> 00:59:48,333
- About what?
- Just a story.

618
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,675
No ghosts.

619
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:56,930
That'll be all tonight, Caroline. Thank you.

620
00:59:58,473 --> 00:59:59,849
I'll come back to check on him--

621
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:03,847
No, that won't be necessary.
That's all for tonight. Good night.

622
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,635
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

623
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:58,693
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

624
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:01,364
Grace.

625
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:02,698
<i>Caroline?</i>

626
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:04,700
Caroline.

627
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:50,995
Mrs. Devereaux?

628
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:18,900
Her and her ghost shit.

629
01:02:40,594 --> 01:02:43,132
<i>That attic is filled</i>
<i>with this stuff.</i>

630
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:46,472
Recipes. Spells. Books of them.
Records of them.

631
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:48,847
I understand your cause of concern...

632
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,853
but my family is superstitious, too.
We're called Baptists.

633
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,063
- This is different.
- It's charming.

634
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:56,271
Local color.

635
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:59,236
You said yourself
you were worried about him.

636
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:03,365
Well, now I'm worried about you.
You know?

637
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,489
Are you a nurse or a detective?

638
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:11,244
When did you first meet the Devereauxs?

639
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,124
Just before he had his stroke.

640
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,333
They were looking for a lawyer
to update their wills.

641
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:17,751
Did you ever think that
maybe she knew something...

642
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,209
was going to happen to him?

643
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:23,677
How? Like tarot cards in the attic?
A séance in her sleep?

644
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:27,385
I want to know why the last girl quit.

645
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:30,430
Hallie. Some folks to see you.

646
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,977
<i>You a superstitious person?</i>

647
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:35,606
Not per se.

648
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:37,482
I told my mama
where I was working.

649
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:40,272
She said that house has been
nothing but blood and tears.

650
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:43,861
That the last owners were
some rich brother and sister.

651
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:45,948
Crazy people, supposedly.

652
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:49,828
They died of strokes
right after they sold the place.

653
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:52,493
Maybe they found something they shouldn't.

654
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:55,124
Maybe now Ben did, too.

655
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:58,416
It may be their mess in that room...

656
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:02,006
but ain't no ghosts
put a spell on that old man.

657
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:03,671
She did.

658
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:06,259
- Do you believe that?
- Don't you?

659
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:08,220
But I heard it can't hurt you.

660
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:11,183
I mean, it can't hurt you if you don't believe.

661
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:14,934
Then I suggest you leave that house
before you do.

662
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:21,771
For God's sake, this is insane.
The man had a stroke.

663
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:23,107
That isn't what he thinks.

664
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:25,610
And you're going to take him away
from her? From his own wife?

665
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:29,115
- How can you believe--
- I don't believe. I don't.

666
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,118
The point is, he does.

667
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:33,076
Stop the car.

668
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:34,784
- Stop the car.
- Why?

669
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:38,540
I've been here before.
I'll show you. It's not just them.

670
01:04:46,052 --> 01:04:48,970
See the line across the doorway?
It's brick dust.

671
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:51,095
Hoodoo. Keeps your enemies
from coming across.

672
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:52,635
See the bones hanging?

673
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:54,434
This stuff's got a hold on people out here.

674
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:56,518
Yeah, but it's not real.

675
01:04:57,314 --> 01:05:00,647
It doesn't matter if it's not real.
It's real to them.

676
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:04,814
What's wrong?

677
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:09,153
This music. I know this music.

678
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,782
You sure this is a good idea?

679
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:14,659
Hello?

680
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:22,044
Mama raised a gentleman.

681
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:27,343
Hello?

682
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:29,302
Excuse me. Ma'am?

683
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:34,971
We heard the music, your record.
I was wondering--

684
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,640
There's no record for anyone here.

685
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:43,229
How about records by a man named Justify?

686
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:49,447
How do you know that name?

687
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,694
Who sent you?

688
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,746
Who else is in here?

689
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,703
- Someone else in here?
- It's just me, ma'am.

690
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:01,667
Stop now. Don't you go touching--

691
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:04,838
Do you know a record called
the <i>Conjure of Sacrifice?</i>

692
01:06:08,218 --> 01:06:10,341
Because I have it, if you do.

693
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:14,055
You had that, you wouldn't say so.

694
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,635
You do know it.

695
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:21,601
The strongest conjuration of all.
They say Justify discovered it...

696
01:06:22,023 --> 01:06:25,108
but he got killed
before he learned to work it.

697
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:30,197
Him and his poor wife both.
It's never been found.

698
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:32,235
What does it do?

699
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:34,283
It keeps you from dying.

700
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,574
Not forever, but for a while.

701
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:39,494
How?

702
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:42,246
You have to sacrifice somebody...

703
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:45,332
and take the years that they have left.

704
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:55,598
Hurry up! He's alone with her!

705
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:59,016
Hang on, Caroline! Wait! Shit!

706
01:07:00,312 --> 01:07:01,391
Now you got me spooked.

707
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,101
If I get proof that she's out
to hurt him, will you stick by me--

708
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:06,563
- By "hurt him," you mean kill him.
- Will you or won't you?

709
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:08,318
Just listen to yourself.

710
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:09,524
Fine. Goodbye.

711
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:11,107
What are you going to do here, kidnap him?

712
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:14,282
You know something's wrong
between them. You know it.

713
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:16,740
Let me make some calls.
See about grounds for...

714
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,662
a restraining order, protective custody.

715
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:20,912
You're not going to get a search
warrant till tomorrow anyhow.

716
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,998
Then that'll give me tonight.

717
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:26,750
I'm all he's got, Luke. Me.

718
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,464
Get the proof. Okay?

719
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:41,225
Mrs. Devereaux, I'm back.

720
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:11,214
No. Where's the record?

721
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:15,051
It was right here.

722
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:02,099
Mrs. Devereaux,
could you come here for a second?

723
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:06,434
Caroline, I was beginning to worry
about you...

724
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:07,980
you were gone such a long while.

725
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:09,689
It's really raining out there.

726
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:11,482
It's supposed to pour all night.

727
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:13,733
Keeps up like this,
that swamp's going to rise...

728
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:15,736
and ruin my flowerbeds.

729
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:18,782
Did you want to see me?

730
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:21,157
Yeah, I was wondering if
you could take a look at this?

731
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:22,662
There's a leak up here.

732
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:25,747
They're all over the house.
They're just rainwater.

733
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:29,873
Yes, but if you look up close...

734
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:34,423
Come on in. I could show it to you better.

735
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:48,348
Actually, I have supper on the stove.

736
01:09:49,856 --> 01:09:51,648
I shouldn't leave it.

737
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:55,150
- It'll just take a second.
- I can see perfectly from here.

738
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:57,070
You want this for the sill?

739
01:09:57,906 --> 01:09:59,234
All right.

740
01:10:01,743 --> 01:10:04,994
Could you come into the room please,
just for a second?

741
01:10:05,623 --> 01:10:08,078
So I can show you what I'm seeing.

742
01:10:12,879 --> 01:10:15,086
You're a funny one, Caroline.

743
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:20,510
I'll make us some tea.

744
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,013
And, Caroline?

745
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:31,810
After you've given Mr. Devereaux
his remedies...

746
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:35,024
would you be so kind
as to join an old lady for supper?

747
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:36,731
- Well, I--
- Wonderful!

748
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:38,860
We should have done it days ago.

749
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:41,195
I've made something real nice.

750
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:55,169
We're leaving tonight.

751
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:05,300
Caroline!

752
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:08,221
Supper.

753
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:32,874
How's your gumbo?

754
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:34,913
I haven't started.

755
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:37,375
Would you like sugar for your tea?
I put it out for you.

756
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:39,752
No, I don't think I'll have any sugar tonight.

757
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:41,922
But I thought you liked it.

758
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:45,092
You always have sugar in your tea.

759
01:11:45,889 --> 01:11:47,929
You think I'm senile, don't you?

760
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,971
Ghosts in the attic. Spells on my husband.

761
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,018
I just don't understand.

762
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:55,811
These ghosts, why would they put
a spell on him and not me?

763
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:57,773
I've been in that room, too.

764
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,565
Maybe because you don't believe in them.

765
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:03,734
Maybe all houses have spirits...

766
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:06,819
but we just don't see them
until we believe we can.

767
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:12,662
I'm really not that hungry.

768
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:18,206
Don't move. I'll fetch the candles.

769
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:21,339
Eat your gumbo. Oh, fiddlesticks.

770
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:44,528
Dinner by candlelight.

771
01:12:45,491 --> 01:12:46,735
There.

772
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:04,962
So, was that the storm or the ghosts?

773
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:08,383
Well, say what you will about spirits.

774
01:13:08,513 --> 01:13:10,553
I've always wondered
if there wasn't something...

775
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:12,390
we could learn from them.

776
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:14,095
Like a spell?

777
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:19,477
I have great respect for your husband.

778
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:22,567
And whatever he thinks
happened to him, he's fighting it.

779
01:13:22,652 --> 01:13:24,526
What did happen to him, Violet?

780
01:13:24,655 --> 01:13:26,446
You haven't touched your gumbo.

781
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:27,653
What have you done to him?

782
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:30,742
I made that special for you,
and you haven't even touched it.

783
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:31,865
What have you done?

784
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:34,665
He is my husband, and I am his wife...

785
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:37,204
and I will do to him whatever I wish to do!

786
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:39,374
He's not safe in this house.

787
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:41,418
What, what...

788
01:13:41,505 --> 01:13:42,916
What is this?

789
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,668
You've done something.

790
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:47,427
He's not safe in this house. Not with you.

791
01:13:47,511 --> 01:13:49,550
- This is my house.
- I'm taking him, Violet.

792
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,842
No!

793
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,976
Too late. Not again.

794
01:13:59,814 --> 01:14:02,732
You little whore. He's mine.

795
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:08,237
Keep him in this house.

796
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,241
Keep him in this--

797
01:14:10,826 --> 01:14:12,201
He's mine!

798
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,536
"Protection."

799
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,388
Where's the record?

800
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:43,894
Oh, God.

801
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:51,361
Got it.

802
01:14:56,747 --> 01:14:58,122
You bitch.

803
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:10,504
Time to go.

804
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:27,312
Come on, Ben.

805
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:30,154
I'm going to get you out of here.
Just hold on.

806
01:15:55,848 --> 01:15:57,092
Damn it!

807
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:00,016
Keep him in this house.

808
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:06,186
Hold on.

809
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,078
Caroline?

810
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:37,758
Oh, shit!

811
01:16:53,447 --> 01:16:54,775
Caroline.

812
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:00,697
Come on, Ben!

813
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,582
We've got to hide you, Ben.

814
01:17:23,518 --> 01:17:26,270
I'm going to get help. I won't leave you.

815
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:30,270
Okay?

816
01:17:41,828 --> 01:17:43,157
Caroline?

817
01:17:49,503 --> 01:17:52,457
You think you can take him
out of this house?

818
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:55,378
You think you're stronger than me?

819
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:59,802
You've no idea how strong I am, Caroline.

820
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:06,889
Caroline!

821
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:14,192
You're just making it harder on yourself!

822
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:17,523
Where are you?

823
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:26,494
You can't get away, Caroline.

824
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:29,458
You understand me?

825
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:32,499
You'll never get out of here, child.

826
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:35,292
Caroline?

827
01:18:38,593 --> 01:18:39,673
Caroline!

828
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:42,053
Stop right there!

829
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:37,943
Thank you.

830
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:43,487
Luke!

831
01:19:44,702 --> 01:19:46,195
Jesus Christ.

832
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:50,828
She tried to kill me.

833
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:53,834
She had a gun.

834
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:56,625
She knows I know. Ben's in trouble.

835
01:19:56,713 --> 01:20:00,462
He's still at the house.
Call the police, Luke. I left him.

836
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,384
We got to get back out there.

837
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:03,844
The hell we do.

838
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,595
I left him there.

839
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:09,511
You didn't leave anyone. Okay? Slow down.

840
01:20:09,851 --> 01:20:12,769
Tell me what happened.
She tried to kill you?

841
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:15,894
Sorry.

842
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:19,527
Mrs. Devereaux.

843
01:20:19,611 --> 01:20:21,402
To what do I owe the--

844
01:20:22,656 --> 01:20:25,407
Heard from Caroline? Why would she have--

845
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:28,411
What's going on?

846
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:32,912
Okay. What happened tonight?

847
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:36,167
Hang on a second.

848
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:38,376
We need to record this.

849
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:44,340
Hurting him? Hurting him how?

850
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:50,557
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

851
01:20:52,895 --> 01:20:54,519
I am listening to you.

852
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:05,882
Good night, child.

853
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:31,906
A hell of a thing, isn't it?

854
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:34,661
See, everywhere you look...

855
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:38,037
it's a whole new world all around you.

856
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:40,580
It's like being born.

857
01:22:41,253 --> 01:22:44,088
Or dying. Of course, I wouldn't know.

858
01:23:06,611 --> 01:23:08,983
Hush, darling. I know it's hard.

859
01:23:12,618 --> 01:23:13,862
We're home!

860
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:16,704
He's missing. She's hidden him somewhere.

861
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:19,497
Where is he, Caroline?

862
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,832
It's not him, it's me.

863
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:27,460
You want to sacrifice me.

864
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:29,379
Where is he, Caroline?

865
01:23:29,467 --> 01:23:31,342
Why are you helping her?

866
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:35,762
- Is everything ready?
- No.

867
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:38,138
I can't start anything till I know where he is.

868
01:23:38,269 --> 01:23:40,391
What's our tale if he gets away?

869
01:23:41,271 --> 01:23:42,849
Caroline...

870
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,189
you will tell me exactly
where my husband is.

871
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:50,648
There's nothing anybody can do
for him, so there's no need to try.

872
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:52,984
Where is he?

873
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,617
Where is he, Caroline?

874
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:03,248
He's in the garden shed.

875
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:10,630
Don't scratch her up any more
than she already is.

876
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:15,929
She's teaching you.

877
01:24:16,389 --> 01:24:19,640
You help her kill me,
and she'll teach you how.

878
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:20,806
Ben knew, too, didn't he?

879
01:24:20,894 --> 01:24:22,305
That's enough, Caroline.

880
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:24,768
You want to shoot me, shoot me.

881
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:26,937
Stop right there, Caroline!

882
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,783
I want my father's picture.

883
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:42,998
I want it with me.

884
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:45,079
Please.

885
01:25:00,726 --> 01:25:02,054
Jesus. All right.

886
01:25:02,144 --> 01:25:05,310
You want your picture,
I'll get your goddamn picture.

887
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:28,999
Fuck!

888
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:38,134
Violet, she's going outside!

889
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:47,601
Violet!

890
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:01,494
She's here!

891
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:04,952
Quick! Go get her! Help me!

892
01:26:07,459 --> 01:26:08,704
Come on.

893
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:23,056
She's fixed the door!

894
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:36,232
Violet, I can't get up the stairs!

895
01:26:50,794 --> 01:26:53,083
You try to use my tricks on me?

896
01:26:58,302 --> 01:26:59,464
On me, huh?

897
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:29,496
No!

898
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:03,192
<i>911 emergency.</i>

899
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:05,490
My name is Caroline Ellis.

900
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:07,742
I'm at 1750...

901
01:28:08,706 --> 01:28:10,912
Bayou Chapelet in Terrebonne Parish.

902
01:28:10,999 --> 01:28:13,206
I need police and paramedics.

903
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:15,831
There are people hurt here. We're trapped.

904
01:28:16,254 --> 01:28:17,630
Please hurry.

905
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:25,926
- <i>What time is it?</i>
- Jill.

906
01:28:26,015 --> 01:28:27,972
- Jill.
- <i>Cary?</i>

907
01:28:28,058 --> 01:28:29,600
Jill, I'm in trouble.

908
01:28:29,685 --> 01:28:30,764
Caroline?

909
01:28:30,852 --> 01:28:32,015
It's real.

910
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:35,143
- It's all real.
- <i>You're where? What?</i>

911
01:28:35,732 --> 01:28:37,523
I'm in the Devereaux house.

912
01:28:38,402 --> 01:28:40,525
<i>What's real? What--</i>

913
01:28:41,863 --> 01:28:42,943
Jill?

914
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:52,617
Caroline!

915
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,999
You can't get away, Caroline.

916
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:06,756
Oh, God, no.

917
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:09,134
Caroline.

918
01:29:16,607 --> 01:29:20,687
"Chalk, sulfur, blood, hair."

919
01:29:32,331 --> 01:29:33,493
Sulfur.

920
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:37,331
Candle.

921
01:29:37,627 --> 01:29:38,790
Chalk.

922
01:29:57,564 --> 01:29:58,727
Hurry!

923
01:30:00,692 --> 01:30:01,855
Circle.

924
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:04,649
Eyes.

925
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:08,237
Four eyes. North, south.

926
01:30:09,034 --> 01:30:11,489
Hurry! Oh, God, please.

927
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:13,537
What's next?

928
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:18,830
Hair.

929
01:30:29,179 --> 01:30:30,555
My child...

930
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:33,554
I believe you broke my legs.

931
01:30:36,395 --> 01:30:38,103
You can't touch me.

932
01:30:38,605 --> 01:30:43,563
You can't get near me. See this?
This is your spell of protection.

933
01:30:44,069 --> 01:30:46,026
Is that what that is now?

934
01:30:47,322 --> 01:30:50,240
And who exactly gave you that spell?

935
01:30:50,742 --> 01:30:53,529
All that circle protects is you...

936
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:56,080
from leaving it.

937
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,249
You stay back!

938
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:06,338
I'll kill you! You stay away!

939
01:31:06,758 --> 01:31:09,296
We've been waiting for you, Caroline.

940
01:31:09,595 --> 01:31:11,718
Waiting for you to believe.

941
01:31:12,389 --> 01:31:14,927
It doesn't work if you don't believe.

942
01:31:17,436 --> 01:31:19,475
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

943
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:22,143
<i>From the dry dust out of these chains.</i>

944
01:31:22,274 --> 01:31:24,065
I don't believe.

945
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:27,314
I don't.

946
01:31:30,616 --> 01:31:32,109
I think you do.

947
01:31:32,284 --> 01:31:36,827
The weakness is the flesh.
The flesh, the flesh.

948
01:31:36,955 --> 01:31:39,244
I don't believe.

949
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:42,621
I don't...

950
01:31:45,464 --> 01:31:47,337
I don't believe in it.

951
01:31:56,141 --> 01:31:58,430
The flesh. The coil.

952
01:31:58,519 --> 01:31:59,763
I don't believe.

953
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:02,018
The frail. The weak.

954
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:04,142
I don't believe.

955
01:32:06,192 --> 01:32:07,355
I don't...

956
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:09,731
No.

957
01:32:12,365 --> 01:32:13,741
Oh, my God.

958
01:32:19,206 --> 01:32:20,830
I don't believe!

959
01:32:23,001 --> 01:32:24,626
I don't believe!

960
01:32:25,253 --> 01:32:26,831
I don't believe!

961
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:28,916
I don't believe!

962
01:33:55,886 --> 01:33:57,510
Thank you, child.

963
01:34:07,605 --> 01:34:08,851
Cecile?

964
01:34:10,108 --> 01:34:11,651
You all right?

965
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,194
I'm fine now, Justify.

966
01:34:18,241 --> 01:34:20,365
A fair bit harder than the lawyer,
wasn't she?

967
01:34:20,452 --> 01:34:22,326
It's harder every time.

968
01:34:23,205 --> 01:34:25,661
They just don't believe like they used to.

969
01:34:25,749 --> 01:34:27,457
Got to get them riled up.

970
01:34:32,798 --> 01:34:35,633
I told you I wanted a black one this time.

971
01:34:36,051 --> 01:34:38,257
You know the black ones never stay.

972
01:34:39,638 --> 01:34:41,677
Beggars can't be choosers.

973
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:45,013
I think it fits you beautifully.

974
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:48,812
It's better than Violet, or Grace, even.

975
01:34:51,107 --> 01:34:54,274
We'll get used to it. We always do.

976
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:12,626
The thing folks don't understand
about sacrifice...

977
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:16,172
Get me out of here.

978
01:35:17,634 --> 01:35:19,674
...sometimes it's more of a trade.

979
01:35:19,803 --> 01:35:21,511
Get me out of here.

980
01:35:23,974 --> 01:35:25,931
No!

981
01:35:26,018 --> 01:35:27,891
There, there, Caroline.

982
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:45,494
We thought it was just a fall, but
now she can't move or even speak.

983
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:47,246
Like a stroke or something.

984
01:35:47,331 --> 01:35:48,493
Cary?

985
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:51,125
Dearie me.

986
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:56,083
You called me.

987
01:35:56,173 --> 01:35:57,631
I called you?

988
01:36:00,636 --> 01:36:02,842
For help. Don't you remember?

989
01:36:03,806 --> 01:36:06,890
Cary's not herself right now.
I'm Luke Marshall.

990
01:36:07,559 --> 01:36:10,809
- Devereauxs' lawyer.
- Hi. Jill Dupay, her roommate.

991
01:36:11,229 --> 01:36:13,436
Jill, yes, I did call you.

992
01:36:14,107 --> 01:36:16,777
Fiddlesticks.
I don't know what possessed me.

993
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:19,735
It's all right. I'm here.

994
01:36:21,448 --> 01:36:23,405
They need real care now.

995
01:36:24,118 --> 01:36:25,742
They can't stay here.

996
01:36:25,869 --> 01:36:27,661
This is all my fault.

997
01:36:27,746 --> 01:36:29,454
No, Cary. No, it's not.

998
01:36:30,374 --> 01:36:31,619
It's not.

999
01:36:42,135 --> 01:36:45,635
Someone should ride
to the hospital with them. Maybe...

1000
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:50,055
Jill, would you mind? And we'll meet you.

1001
01:36:51,979 --> 01:36:53,936
Of course. Whatever you need.

1002
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:04,862
She meant so much to them, her being here.

1003
01:37:06,201 --> 01:37:08,324
I know it wasn't for long, but...

1004
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:11,455
they really loved her.

1005
01:37:12,625 --> 01:37:14,166
Why do you say that?

1006
01:37:19,423 --> 01:37:21,130
It's in their wills.

1007
01:37:21,925 --> 01:37:23,882
They left her the house.
