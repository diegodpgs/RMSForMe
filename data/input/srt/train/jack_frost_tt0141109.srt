Spell Checked by

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
HxHPRC: Enjoy your hours!

3
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,400
We're going to do
a Christmas tune for you now.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,200
You got to trust me. This one's
just a little bit different.

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,100
It combines the Christmas
colors, red...

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,500
...green...

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,300
...and blues!

8
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,700
Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly, happy soul

9
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,400
He was smoking his pipe, baby
His two eyes were made of coal

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairy tale they say

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
He was made of ice and snow
Then he came to life one day

12
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,400
Frosty the Snowman
Was as bad as he could be

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,300
And the children say
He could laugh and play

14
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,300
Just the same as you and me

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Man, check it out.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,300
It's the Jack Frost Band.

17
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,300
They're digging it. They're loving it.
We gotta sign these guys.

18
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,200
There must've been some magic
In the air that night

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,600
For that old silk cap they found

20
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,200
For when

21
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,600
They laid it upon his head

22
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,200
He began

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,300
To hootchy-koo around

24
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,100
And Frosty the Snowman

25
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,900
Is a fairy tale they say

26
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,900
He was made of ice and snow

27
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,600
Till he came...

28
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
...to...

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,000
...life...

30
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,800
...one day

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
That was Medford's own Jack Frost Band.
Best band no one's ever heard of.

32
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,200
That's recorded live last night
at Denver's Music Hall.

33
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,800
Don't ask how we got the tape.
They are due for a break.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We got more music coming
from the '70s and '90s.

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,300
No '60s. No '80s. I promise.

36
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,700
Central Colorado's classic rock.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
School's out!

38
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,100
No running. Feet are for walking.

39
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,200
Merry Christmas, everybody.
See you next year!

40
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,400
Merry Christmas, Miss Moon.

41
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,900
Hey, Charlie.

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Happy vacation, Charlie.

43
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,700
Snowball fight!

44
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,600
- The brain's here.
- What's going on?

45
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,300
The 7th graders have us pinned down.

46
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,100
They're using the heavy artillery!

47
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,100
Come on, how bad could it be?

48
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,100
Two, three, launch!

49
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,000
What was that?

50
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,800
Bull's-eye!

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
- We tried to tell you.
- Rory Buck.

52
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,800
Alexander!

53
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,500
Help him!

54
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Natalie, help!

55
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,800
Eat snow, you little wieners.

56
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,700
Huddle up. Come on.

57
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,100
Remember what we learned
in history class?

58
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,100
- No.
- Not really.

59
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,600
If you want to stop an army,
stop the general.

60
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,200
You're taking on Rory Buck?

61
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
Trust me, Tuck, all right?

62
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,500
You draw their fire.

63
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,000
Good luck, man.

64
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Fire!

65
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Get him!

66
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,900
I dare you to hit me.

67
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,300
Load me up.

68
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,800
- Are you all right?
- No.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
Come on. Give me your best shot.

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,500
Can't you do better than that?

71
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, that was a good one.

72
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Go now! Go, run!

73
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Wait!

74
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Come on, Alexander!

75
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,200
What did you do that for, butthead?

76
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,200
That little twerp's getting away!

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,100
Run like the wind, Alexander!

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,900
Are you okay?

79
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,800
I'll take care of this one myself.

80
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,400
Hold your fire.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Rory's pissed!

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,100
Well, well, well.
Little Charlie Frost.

83
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,100
- Hanging with the second graders now?
- Get off, Rory.

84
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,200
I got a present for you.

85
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,200
Nail him, Rory.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,400
Good, I like presents.

87
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,400
Can you say, "brain freeze"?

88
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,900
Brain freeze.

89
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,100
Way to go, buddy.

90
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,100
All right, Charlie.

91
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,700
This isn't the end of it, Frost.

92
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Oh, yeah! Way to go!

93
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,900
Shut up!

94
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,200
You okay? Good man.

95
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Thanks, Charlie. You're amazing.

96
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,300
No problem.

97
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,500
See you at hockey, Charlie.

98
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
- See you, Natalie.
- Good job, dude.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,400
See you later.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,200
Hey, Chester.

101
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,900
Come on, boy.

102
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,400
Dad?

103
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,900
Hi, Mom.

104
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,600
It's a long drive from Denver.
You know he won't be back until late.

105
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,800
This drain, I don't get it.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,200
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes it doesn't.

107
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,300
So?

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,700
So?

109
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,400
So not turning over your report card
right away is a bad sign.

110
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,200
Here.

111
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,500
I'm going to play hockey
in the driveway.

112
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,700
Running away. That's another bad sign.

113
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,700
You may have your father's looks,
but you get your brains from me.

114
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,000
Good work, Charlie.

115
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,100
Wait till your dad sees this.

116
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Excuse me, miss?

117
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,300
Listen, my car broke down back here.

118
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,400
Can I borrow a couple of bucks
till I get to a gas station?

119
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,800
Money? I'm sorry.
My husband's a musician.

120
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,000
Really?

121
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,400
- Is he any good?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,700
Really?

123
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,400
You know, I also left
my lip balm in the car.

124
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,400
So I'm out, and I think
I'm feeling a little...

125
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
Chapped?

126
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,000
I wonder if I could
borrow some lip balm?

127
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I don't know if you'll like what I got.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,900
Do you mind if I try?

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,500
- You like it?
- You know, I can't tell.

130
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
Let me just...

131
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

132
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,700
Okay, that's for you.
What's for me?

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,700
I hope you brought me chocolates.
Yes!

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,500
He waited as long as he could.

135
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,800
- Let's get him up.
- No. Don't get him up.

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Come on.

137
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,500
He's got the whole vacation to sleep.
Come on.

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,500
Dude? Charlie-boy?

139
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,800
Charlie-boy.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,800
Dad?

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Get up, man.

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,700
I was just resting my eyes.

143
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,100
You were?

144
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,700
You looked asleep. Didn't he?

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,700
You looked like you were asleep.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,300
- Exactly like you were sleeping.
- No, I was waiting up for you.

147
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,800
Okay, you can go back to sleep.
I just wanted to say hi.

148
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,500
I want to give you
a weather update too.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
It's snowing!

150
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,900
Can I, Mom?

151
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,900
Can I, Mom?

152
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,100
Dad, not another fathead.

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,600
He's not a fathead.

154
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,900
He's just smart, so he needs
a big cranium for his brain.

155
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
Now what?

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,800
Nose. Come on, nose.

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,900
I said "nose"!

158
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
I thought you said "hose".

159
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,000
Sorry.

160
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,900
Scarf.

161
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Give me your hat.

162
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,700
Thank you.

163
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,500
Yes. Perfect.

164
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,600
How's he look?

165
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
He Looks like you.

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,800
He does?

167
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,600
Only a little cuter.

168
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,200
Good one, Mom.

169
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,600
Really?

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Really.

171
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Cuter than this?

172
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Don't even...

173
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,400
You are...

174
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
...so dead!

175
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,500
You know what?
You throw like a girl.

176
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Welcome home, Jack!

177
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
Now go to sleep!

178
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,400
Sorry, Mrs. Wilkins.

179
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,200
Sorry, Mrs. Wilkins.

180
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Hey, seriously, from this angle...

181
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
...she looks hot
in that flannel nightgown...

182
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,000
Pulling an all nighter?

183
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,400
Get your skinny little butt
in that bed.

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
Nice work on that snowman, dude.

185
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,700
Thanks.

186
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,100
- Except you made his head way too big.
- I did?

187
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
You put the bottom ball
on the top ball.

188
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,100
- How you doing?
- Good.

189
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,600
- How was Denver?
- Denver's pretty cool.

190
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,000
Cool. How're the guys?

191
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,000
They're great.
Everybody says hi.

192
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,400
So?

193
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,600
So?

194
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,800
Is there anything you need to show me?

195
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,900
Like?

196
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,600
Like something in the shape...

197
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,700
...of a present.

198
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,900
Like from the gig?

199
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,400
Like those plastic swords they
stick through the olives and onions?

200
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,700
Yeah, Like for the martinis
Mom packs in my lunch.

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
Mom's making you martinis?

202
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,600
- I'm up to two now.
- Good.

203
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,700
Two a day.

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
I brought you this.

205
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
One of your harmonicas?

206
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,900
That's one of my old harmonicas.

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,100
Sure you want me to have this?

208
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,200
Absolutely I want you to have it.

209
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Where'd you get it?

210
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,200
Where'd I get it?

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,100
I got that from...

212
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,800
...an old famous blues player named
Sonny Boy Wayne.

213
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,000
- Yeah, right.
- I did.

214
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,000
Sonny Boy Wayne.

215
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,300
He was 9 feet tall and could play, man.
There was a white light around him.

216
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,400
And he gave you this?

217
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,200
He did. He said,
"Son, I want you to have this.

218
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
It'll give you the power".

219
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,900
Come on, seriously.
Where'd you get it?

220
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,200
You want to know?

221
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
I got that...

222
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,200
...the morning you were born.

223
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Really?

224
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,200
Little music store
across from the hospital.

225
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,800
I walked out in a great mood,
bought myself that harmonica.

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,300
And I never had a harmonica
that played better.

227
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,900
My favorite one.

228
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,700
- Now it's yours.
- Thanks.

229
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,700
You're welcome. Now go to sleep.

230
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Son...

231
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
...I want you to go to sleep now.

232
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,200
It's awesome!

233
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,400
Okay, see you in the morning.

234
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
We play hockey tomorrow.
Can you come?

235
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,300
Yes, sir. Wait a minute, I can't.
We have to go into the studio.

236
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,400
Well, the game's not till four.

237
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,800
And it's against
our arch rivals, the Devils.

238
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,200
You're 1 1. You already have arch rivals?

239
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,800
Four. Yeah, what am I thinking?
I'm there. I'm there.

240
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,000
Definitely.

241
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Great.

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,200
You know another thing about this
harmonica? It has magic powers.

243
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,600
Yeah, right.

244
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,700
I'm serious.

245
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,400
When you play that,
no matter where I am...

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
...I can hear it.

247
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,500
Right.

248
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,600
I'm telling you.

249
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,000
Good night.

250
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,300
Love you. Go to sleep.

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,100
You looking for the power?

252
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,400
Just testing it.

253
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
A major label? What do you think
of this Kaplan kid?

254
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,300
I Like him. He's smart.
He really knows music.

255
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,400
And you know what?
I think this guy really gets us.

256
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh, good.

257
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,700
How's things at the bank?

258
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,200
How's that new guy
in the loan department?

259
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,600
Glenn? He's a nice guy.

260
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,300
He hit on me.

261
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,100
Really?

262
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,800
How about that? Guys don't even
check for rings anymore.

263
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,800
Relax. He's 63.
I straightened him out.

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,700
You straightened him out?
What exactly does that mean?

265
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,500
Stop it.

266
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,500
No wonder he hit on you.
Look at you.

267
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,900
I don't wear this to the bank.

268
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,900
You're barely wearing it here.

269
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,200
Sing me a smile.

270
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,400
Well, the driver on the bus says,
"Move on back..."

271
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,300
No, sing me the other one.

272
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,900
My song.

273
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Every time

274
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
We say goodbye

275
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,800
I die a little

276
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,800
Take off your boots.

277
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Every time

278
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
We say goodbye

279
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,200
Oh, man, if I had one hit song...

280
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,300
You will.

281
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,100
I'd make you guys proud of me.

282
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,800
We're already really proud of you.

283
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,600
- Buy you a nice big house.
- I'd settle for a new sink.

284
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I can get you a new car,
like a Porsche.

285
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,600
Anything but a Jeep is a sissy car.

286
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,400
I'd get you some diamonds.

287
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,100
All I need is you.

288
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,400
I love you, Gab.

289
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,600
I Love you too.

290
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,800
'Cause when you're near

291
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,900
There's such an air

292
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,800
Of spring

293
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,700
About it

294
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,800
I bet you would Like
a snow blower, though.

295
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,800
Lift it up.

296
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,800
I don't remember you hanging
this many lights last year.

297
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,800
That's because I didn't hang this many.

298
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,700
Little straighter.
Yours is crooked on that side.

299
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,200
If you come down a bit at your end...

300
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
You've come too far now.

301
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,800
See, you've gone too far there...

302
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,700
Be careful, Mac.

303
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,800
You don't want to be on the wrong end
of that left hook.

304
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Bye, baby.

305
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
I'll be in the car.

306
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,500
Front of the goal, shoots.

307
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,600
Hit the post.

308
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,600
A little wide. But nice shot.
Who taught you that shot?

309
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,700
Coach Gronic.

310
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,400
Dicky Gronic?

311
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,000
Dicky Gronic is your coach?
He can't play hockey.

312
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,400
Dad, Sid Gronic.

313
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,400
Sid Gronic's good.
Sid Gronic's very good.

314
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,500
He's one of the best,
if he could stay out of prison.

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,100
What was that?

316
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,400
That's something I call the "J-shot".

317
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,900
- Teach me.
- Come here.

318
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
You're big enough to handle this now.

319
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,900
- We got to go.
- Be with you in one second.

320
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,800
Hold on a minute.

321
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,800
Say the guy's coming down
right here, defensive man.

322
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,200
Bring it on the stick's toe.
Back to the heel.

323
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
Now cut loose.

324
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,800
There you go. Nice shot.
Very good.

325
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,100
- I still don't get it.
- I'll show you when I come back.

326
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,900
But I need it for today's game.

327
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,500
Teach you when I come back.

328
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,000
But, Dad, I want to...

329
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
"Butt Dad"?

330
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,800
Did you just call me "Butt Dad"?

331
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is that the kind of thing
Coach Gronic teaches you? Butt Dad?

332
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,600
By the way, that would
make you Butt Boy. Bye.

333
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,200
Bye, Butt Family.

334
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
See you in a while.

335
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,700
Love you guys. Bye.

336
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
All right.

337
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,100
Oh, man.

338
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,800
First period's behind us.

339
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Forget about it.
God knows I'm going to try.

340
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,600
I know you're just kids.

341
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,600
And we're really here to teach you...

342
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,700
...fair play and sportsmanship
and all that crap.

343
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,400
But I am so tired of Looking
up at that scoreboard...

344
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,100
...and seeing that we're behind
the Devils again...

345
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,300
...and again...

346
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,900
...and again...

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Lighten up, Dad.

348
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
Sorry.

349
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,900
History is made by winners.

350
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,500
Conquerors.

351
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,400
Barbarians.

352
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,300
Now, I want you to go out there...

353
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,600
...and wipe the ice
with their filthy butts!

354
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,700
All right?!

355
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,000
Play clean.
Have a good game.

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,900
Come on, guys.
Let's whup them!

357
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,600
Hey, Rory.

358
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,500
Hey, sweetheart. Miss me?

359
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,300
Let's nail it this time. You're
getting tighter. We're almost there.

360
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Come on, Charlie!

361
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,300
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

362
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,700
- Good luck, Jack.
- Afraid I'm going to need it.

363
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,600
- See you Later.
- All right, man. Thanks.

364
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
I hope it's not bad.

365
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,400
How bad is it in there?

366
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

367
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,200
- Something smells good...
- You promised him.

368
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,300
Why'd you go and do that, Jack?

369
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,000
I've told you. If you're not going
to be there, don't say you will be.

370
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,000
You know how I knew you promised him?

371
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
He kept Looking at me up in the stands.

372
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,000
And after about the 40th time...

373
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,300
...I realized he expected you
to be there.

374
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,100
I don't care if you get too busy
or you flake out on me.

375
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,700
Well, I care, but I chose it.

376
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,700
I married you. I'll deal with it.

377
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,200
He didn't choose this.

378
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,300
One of these days,
Charlie will score his first goal...

379
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,400
...and you won't see it.
Like you never saw his measles...

380
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,700
...or the time he jammed
Fig Newtons into the projector.

381
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Those things only happen once.

382
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,500
Don't, Jack. You said enough.

383
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,600
Hey, buddy.

384
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,800
How'd you guys do?

385
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Got killed. Eight-zip.

386
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,600
I'm really sorry I didn't make it.

387
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,400
I'm really sorry, man.

388
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,400
Hey, look...

389
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,800
I got to talk to you about something...

390
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,100
...that's really important.

391
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,600
You know how you always wanted to be
the next Wayne Gretzky?

392
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,100
I always had a dream too.

393
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Ever since I was about your age...

394
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,800
...I just really wanted
to be a great musician.

395
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,200
I just wanted to be a real player.

396
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,500
I wanted to make a living
doing what I Love.

397
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,000
And I really want to make
a nice Living for you, me and Mom.

398
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,400
Well, see...

399
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
...that might be...

400
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,400
...kind of starting to happen.

401
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,200
That's good, Dad.

402
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Yeah, it is good.

403
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,200
And it's really, really good
for you to have a dream.

404
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,900
Tricky part here is sometimes...

405
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,200
...if you're not careful, you can...

406
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,900
...I don't know, kind of turn
into kind of a...

407
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Selfish jerk?

408
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,600
All right.

409
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,600
Yeah.

410
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,900
So are all musicians really flaky?

411
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,400
Yeah, basically, I think.

412
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,300
All the drummers.

413
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Okay, here's an idea.

414
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,800
I've thought about this one
for a while.

415
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,800
You, me, Mom,
we go to the cabin up at Pine Top.

416
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,500
We have a real Christmas vacation,
just us.

417
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,000
No phone, no TV, no band, nothing.
What do you think?

418
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,500
Really?

419
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Will you teach me the J-shot?

420
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,100
I will teach you the J-shot.

421
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,900
Hold on a second. No TV?

422
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Yeah, I know.
I was thinking about that too.

423
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,600
Maybe a Little TV.

424
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,000
Okay, cool.

425
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,400
So, eight-oh...

426
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,600
How bad was it?

427
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,000
I think Coach Gronic popped a vein.

428
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,900
- Here, hon, let me get that bag.
- I forgave you last night.

429
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,000
- Then can you grab one of these?
- Nope.

430
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,100
What's in there, a dead body?

431
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,500
No, it's just, like, Gameboy,
batteries, food, clothes...

432
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
We'll only be up there
three days.

433
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,400
We could get snowed in for months.
You'll thank me.

434
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,800
Grab the phone, will you?

435
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,000
Hello?

436
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,800
Yeah, sure, hold on a second.

437
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,800
It's for you.

438
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,100
John Kaplan?

439
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll meet you in the car.

440
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,400
I just got this...

441
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,900
...kind of unbelievable phone call.

442
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
The record company heard our tape...

443
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,800
...went nuts.

444
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Oh, honey!

445
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,900
Dad, this is awesome!

446
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,300
That's great!

447
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,400
- You think?
- What's the matter?

448
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,500
Well, the head of Asylum
has to see us.

449
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,400
He'll only sign one act.
There's 3 other bands...

450
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,600
...and he'll only sign us
if we go to his party in Aspen.

451
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,600
When?

452
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Tomorrow.

453
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,400
Christmas?

454
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,500
I know.

455
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,500
There's got to be another time
he can see you.

456
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,300
According to Kaplan,
there is no other time. This is it.

457
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,200
Don't worry. Forget about it.
It's too hard, because...

458
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,700
Hold on a second.

459
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,100
I don't even want to go.

460
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Let's see if we can work this out.

461
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,300
I mean, how Long
do you have to play?

462
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,800
I don't know. That's a good point.
Could maybe play a half an hour.

463
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,900
Don't play a whole set. They can tell
how you sound in a few songs.

464
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,000
Get out...

465
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,900
Maybe I could borrow Mac's car.
I could drive back.

466
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,300
That way I could be back
by Christmas night.

467
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,100
But I'll miss Christmas Day for sure.

468
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,300
Here.

469
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,400
What's this?
I gave this to you.

470
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't want it.

471
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,800
This is going to be a great gig, man.

472
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,600
We'll rock this guy's house and
blow it apart. He'll have to remodel.

473
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,400
This is the one. I'm telling you.
This is a good thing.

474
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,800
- So when do you want me to pull over?
- Right now. Over here.

475
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,000
What am I, crazy? I got a great wife.
I got a great kid.

476
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,500
I'm not living this life anymore.
I'm going home.

477
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,700
Good.
You're making the right decision.

478
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,200
If they like us now,
they'll like us next week.

479
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,600
It's Christmas.
They can mail us the contract.

480
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,800
- How do I explain this to the guys?
- Are you nuts? Watch this.

481
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,900
Hey, guys.

482
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,700
- The gig's off.
- Thank you, Santa.

483
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,100
Nobody wanted to come. Lou's mom
wants to cook Christmas dinner.

484
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,600
Yes, Merry Christmas, boys.

485
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm going to see my family.

486
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,800
This is great! I'll take
the 40 to Highway 2, and then...

487
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,000
Why don't you take the car?

488
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,200
It'd be so much faster that way.

489
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,100
Oh, man!

490
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Now, where did he say that spot was?

491
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,400
There it is.

492
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,500
Come on, Mac.

493
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,200
Merry Christmas.
Have a great vacation.

494
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Merry Christmas.

495
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,300
Thanks.

496
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,000
Feet are for walking!

497
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,000
Frost. You big butthead.

498
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,100
Forget it, Rory.

499
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,100
He's no fun to pick on anymore
since his old man died.

500
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Yeah? Well, it's time
he gets over it.

501
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,000
I never even met my old man.

502
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,400
- Want a lift home?
- No, I'm not going home.

503
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,400
You shouldn't walk in the road.

504
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,300
No one's around. It's all right.

505
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,800
Okay, well, I'll see you tonight.

506
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Why?

507
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
I'm baby-sitting.

508
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Well, not baby-sitting.
You're not a baby.

509
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,500
We can hang out
while your mom Christmas shops.

510
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
All right.

511
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,900
See you later, Charlie.

512
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,500
Sorry, dude!

513
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,400
Damn it!

514
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,400
Damn it!

515
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,000
I can drive through it.

516
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I can get it.

517
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,600
Really, it's okay.

518
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,300
No, it's not okay. Hold on.

519
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,700
It's okay. It's okay.

520
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,400
Charlie, it's okay. It's okay.

521
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,100
I miss him too. I miss him too.

522
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,000
It's going to be okay, honey.
I promise.

523
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,700
Here you go.

524
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,200
Thanks.

525
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,200
How you doing, little bear?

526
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,200
Fine.

527
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,200
I'll stay home. We'll hang out.

528
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,400
No, Mom, I'll be fine.

529
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
I've done my Christmas shopping.
I'm good.

530
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,500
No, me and Mac'll be fine.

531
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,500
Want a marshmallow?

532
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,200
What do you want? One?

533
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Two?

534
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,300
Maybe four?

535
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Maybe all 500?

536
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,200
Thanks, Mom.

537
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,800
Your dad loved this guy.

538
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,200
They even played together
a couple of times.

539
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,700
Nice to know he had
time for someone.

540
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,900
Come on, Dad, put the head on.

541
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,400
Now, okay, Natalie,
pack some snow in there.

542
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,100
Let's go in the house.
Come on. It's getting cold.

543
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,900
I'm going to get you now.
Gotcha!

544
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,100
I'm home!

545
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Hey, I'm home.

546
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,900
Man, it's cold!

547
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,200
Could you open up?

548
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,200
Charlie, it's me.
It's Dad!

549
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Could you get the door?

550
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,200
What?!

551
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,100
No.

552
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,000
No way!

553
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,800
Can't be.

554
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,200
What is that?

555
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,300
Hey! Come on!
That's disgusting!

556
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,300
Chester, it's me.

557
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
It's me. It's Jack!

558
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,000
- Chester just peed on a live snowman!
- No cranberries.

559
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,600
What?

560
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,100
This is not happening.

561
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,800
This cannot be happening!

562
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,300
Can you let me in?

563
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,700
Charlie, look...

564
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm having kind of a bad day here.

565
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,500
Come on, Mac.

566
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,000
This ought to do it.

567
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,600
Kiddo, it's getting cold!

568
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,800
That's my branch!

569
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,700
Okay, come on.

570
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,700
Come on. Come on!

571
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,100
This is unbelievable.

572
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
When I was a human, nothing.

573
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,700
Now all of a sudden
you want to play?

574
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Come on, Chester...

575
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,400
That's the coldest wedgie
I ever had.

576
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
Well, look what we have here.

577
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,100
Let me pick up my...

578
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,100
...arm.

579
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,800
Is that a snowplow?

580
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,400
Excuse me. Hello!

581
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,800
I'm on the front of your plow,
Mr. Snowplow Driver!

582
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,500
Big headache!

583
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,000
Wonderful service.
Thanks for the lift.

584
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,900
Come on, shake it off.
It's just snow.

585
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,400
Great.

586
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,500
Talk about your separation anxiety.

587
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,400
Hey, you!
Ball number two.

588
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,000
Don't just sit there.
Give me a hand.

589
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
Okay, that's it.

590
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,300
Come on, no.

591
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,000
Get the mitten out of my eye.

592
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
No, that's my nose.

593
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,200
That's my cork!

594
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,300
There we go.
Got it. Got it.

595
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,400
Now watch it.
Okay, one, two...

596
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,200
...three!

597
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,800
I'm getting dizzy.

598
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,200
Man!

599
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,800
Something's missing.

600
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Nice work, ball number three.

601
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,400
Man, it's bad enough
my ticket got punched...

602
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,100
...but to come back like this!
It's embarrassing.

603
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,800
I've put myself back together
after some rough nights...

604
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,900
...but this is ridiculous.

605
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,200
Don't panic.
Just act real casual.

606
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah, just act casual.

607
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,400
Wait a minute. I'm a snowman.

608
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,100
There you go.

609
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,300
Hello there.

610
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,500
Maybe Charlie's snapping out of it.

611
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,000
It's good to see these again.

612
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,300
Let's get you bundled up.
It's going to be a cold one.

613
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,700
Back off!

614
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,300
- What's going on?
- I'm so glad to see you.

615
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,200
Have you been watching
the Sci-Fi Channel again?

616
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,200
Gabby, you're back.

617
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,700
Charlie's been great all evening.

618
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,800
- What happened here?
- I was thinking the same thing.

619
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,100
It's the snowman.

620
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,300
I saw it. Terrific job!

621
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,000
No! Mom, he's alive!

622
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,500
Well, I'd better be going.

623
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Not so fast.
Honey, are you sure you're okay?

624
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,600
I swear, he came to life,
waddled into the street...

625
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,400
...and a snowplow took him away!

626
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,500
Well...

627
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
...I guess it got a cab back, then.

628
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,300
What?

629
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,600
How...?

630
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,200
Thanks, Mac.

631
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,800
You're welcome.

632
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,400
Good work!

633
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,900
You look good.

634
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,600
Oh, man...

635
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,400
...I never did fix that.

636
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,200
Oh, man, why me?

637
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,300
Why a snowman?

638
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,300
I mean, could the universe
really be that unoriginal?

639
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,600
I don't know.

640
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,700
Is it the name Jack Frost?

641
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,900
Because if that's it,
that's not even clever.

642
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,500
I should accept it.
I'm a frozen freak of nature.

643
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,500
I just want to know why.

644
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,800
I'm just...
Could you just give me...

645
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,800
Could I just have some kind of sign?

646
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,800
What the...?

647
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,700
Well, at least it's not a snowplow.

648
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,600
Sid? Sid Gronic?

649
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,600
Sid, is that you?

650
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,800
Been hearing great things about you.
Seriously.

651
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,800
Sid, come here!
Wait, wait, wait!

652
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,800
Where you going?

653
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,400
Wait.

654
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,700
Thanks for the help, Sid!

655
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,500
All right, wait a minute.
I just have to pull this together.

656
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,200
When I saw my reflection, I denied it.
That was my denial period.

657
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,700
I go off on Sid.

658
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,200
Clearly, I've had my anger period.

659
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,200
That's what they say you do.
First you deny, then you go into anger.

660
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,600
I just have to accept it.

661
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,700
I accept I'm a snowman.

662
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,200
Sid!

663
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,100
All right.

664
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,800
Come on.

665
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,900
Just a regular snowman, huh?

666
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,500
We'll see about that.

667
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,200
Who are you and what do you want?

668
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,100
Talk, or I'll
turn you into a puddle.

669
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,500
I know you're alive.

670
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,800
So you better...

671
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,800
...start...

672
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,800
...talking.

673
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,000
That thing's hot.

674
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,800
What are you doing?
I'm your father.

675
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,200
Okay, you're grounded.

676
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,300
Come here.

677
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,100
Charlie, it's me! Dad!
Honest.

678
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,900
- I can explain everything.
- Get away from me!

679
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,000
I can't explain the part about
me being a snowman, but...

680
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,800
Go pick on someone as dumb as you.

681
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,600
As dumb as me?

682
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,800
- Good one, Rory.
- Give it back!

683
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,300
Spin move.

684
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,300
Right here, right here,
right here.

685
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,000
Oh, look.

686
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,400
It's our little hero.

687
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,500
Don't worry about him anymore.
He's not even in the game.

688
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,900
You're so immature.

689
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,800
Come on, give it back.

690
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,800
Give it back.

691
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,000
Did you guys see that?

692
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,200
So you do want a piece of me.

693
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,200
Thought you learned your lesson.

694
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,200
Kid, how's it going?

695
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,400
What are you doing here?

696
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,300
Guess it's time for a
refresher course.

697
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,100
Okay, snowball fight?

698
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,900
You picked the wrong area
to mess with me, and that's snow.

699
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,300
Three balls, two sticks,
one cork nose. Snowman? No.

700
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,000
Much, much more.
I am the Wizard of Blizzard!

701
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,000
Now run!
Run, you little mountain goats!

702
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,300
Boy, the old Wizard
could use a nap.

703
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,200
I'm out of gas.

704
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,400
Run!

705
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,400
Let's get him!

706
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,800
Hold up.

707
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,500
He's not going anywhere.

708
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,000
Where are you going to go now, Frost?

709
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,400
Be careful!

710
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,700
Help!

711
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,800
Just hold on!

712
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,000
I'm coming. I'm coming!

713
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,700
I'm coming, Charlie!

714
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,500
I can't hold on!

715
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,700
Hold on. I'm coming.

716
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,300
What are you doing?

717
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,500
Don't you worry. I'm coming!

718
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,400
Told you I was coming.

719
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,200
You know, sometimes
it's good to have a big butt.

720
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,800
Let's get out of here!

721
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,900
There he is!

722
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,800
Let's get him!

723
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,200
Come on, guys.
Go, go, go!

724
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,200
You steer.

725
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,400
I'll scream.

726
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,200
Do something!

727
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,400
Zap them into ice.

728
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,300
Zap them into ice? Get real!
I don't even have pockets.

729
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,900
Duck, Charlie!

730
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,400
That'll cool him off.

731
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,900
Hold on!

732
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,000
I am holding on.

733
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,800
You the man!

734
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,600
No, you the man.

735
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,700
I'm the snowman.

736
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,200
We're safe!

737
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,400
Okay, we're not safe.

738
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,500
What's going on?

739
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Nothing.

740
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,800
I don't think so.

741
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,600
All right!

742
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,100
Look out!

743
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,100
Time to split.

744
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,600
I'll see you at the bottom.

745
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,700
I slimmed down!

746
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,400
Shredding.

747
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,200
Big air!

748
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,900
Right behind you, Frost.

749
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Pull your vehicle over.

750
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,400
Snowman!

751
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,100
Perfect.

752
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,700
Here we go.

753
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,300
Catch some air, baby!

754
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,800
This is awesome!

755
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,000
Look out.
Look out for the trees!

756
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,800
- Carving time!
- I'm behind you!

757
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Big carves.

758
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,800
- We were ripping!
- That was cool.

759
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,800
- That was great.
- Did you see that?

760
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,000
One time, thank you.

761
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,000
Did you see me going down?
The nice thing about big...

762
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,000
...balls, excuse me, is look how
you can move around them.

763
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,000
I like the roundedness.

764
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,400
You can throw your weight over
on this side of the board.

765
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,600
- Better than being skinny.
- Hold on.

766
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,500
- You almost got me killed.
- I saved your butt too, pal.

767
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,800
So I'm supposed to believe
you're my dad?

768
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,900
Do me a favor. Go easy on me.

769
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,100
Because I'm having trouble
dealing with it myself, okay?

770
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,200
You know...

771
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,900
...he died a year ago.

772
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,700
I know. I was there.

773
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,600
You're nuts.

774
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,600
Great. He doesn't believe me.

775
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,500
It's not enough I got...

776
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,900
...these stick arms
and this humongous butt.

777
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,400
And that dippy walk.

778
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,400
What's wrong with my walk?
Is it that bad?

779
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,000
All right.

780
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,100
So you're my dad, huh?

781
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,500
How did my hamster die?

782
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,400
Your hamster? Heart attack.

783
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,800
Vacuum cleaner.

784
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,200
Well, yeah, but...

785
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,800
I'll bet it had a heart attack
on the way in.

786
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,700
All right.

787
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,200
What's my hockey position?

788
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,100
That's easy. Right wing.

789
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,200
- Wrong.
- What? You're a wing.

790
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,300
They moved me to defense last year.

791
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,900
Oh, man, Charlie-boy.

792
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,500
I'm sorry. Defense is a good position,
but you're a natural winger.

793
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,300
Hold on.
What'd you call me?

794
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,300
I said...

795
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,200
..."Charlie-boy".

796
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,600
That's what I always call you.
Charlie-boy.

797
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,800
Dad?

798
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,200
Dad!

799
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,900
It is me, Charlie.
I'm back.

800
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Hold on.
This is really weird.

801
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,600
I just hugged a snowman.

802
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,900
You played on the magic harmonica.

803
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,100
What? Magic harmonica?

804
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,900
I thought you made that up!

805
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,600
So did I.

806
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,800
You know what?

807
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,800
Let's go home and talk, okay?

808
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,300
You know, catch up on stuff.
And you know something?

809
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,100
I'm hungry.

810
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,500
Boy, your mom is going to be jazzed
we fixed that sink.

811
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,100
Snow peas.
You should like these.

812
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,000
Level with me. How is she?

813
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,000
She's good.

814
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,000
She moved a picture
of you next to her bed.

815
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,600
What's that?

816
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,800
Mom's home.

817
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,900
She can't be!
She can't see me like this!

818
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,500
Nobody can see me like this,
but especially her.

819
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,500
Just a minute, Mom!

820
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,600
Honey, why are all the windows open?

821
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,200
Please, you gotta help me.

822
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,100
It's freezing in here.

823
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,400
Charlie, what's going on?

824
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,200
Science fair project.

825
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,800
You're kidding.

826
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Why is the floor wet?

827
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,000
Well, the science fair project...

828
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,900
...it's about what it's like
to live in an igloo.

829
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,700
And Eskimos have
wet floors, Mom. Duh.

830
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,800
It's freezing in here.
What's going on?

831
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,100
And what's with all the food?

832
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,400
I got kind of hungry.

833
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,400
Three bags of veggies?

834
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,000
I got real hungry?

835
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,600
What?

836
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,400
There's something I need to tell you.

837
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,500
Well?

838
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,000
This science fair thing?

839
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,800
It was Natalie's idea.

840
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,700
Okay. Just tell Natalie
the next experiment's at her house.

841
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,300
Grab some towels and help me
with this, okay?

842
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,200
I think I need a day off.

843
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,600
Frosty the Snowman

844
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,900
Had to hurry on his way

845
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,100
But he waved goodbye

846
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,400
Saying, "Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some..."

847
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,900
You said the snowman spoke to you?

848
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,500
Yes, he did.

849
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,800
And he knew my name.

850
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,400
Were there any other witnesses?

851
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,800
There wasn't any other witnesses.

852
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,800
In the Rocky Mountain states...

853
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,300
...folks may not be in for
a white Christmas after all.

854
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,700
Charlie, honey,
did you fix the sink?

855
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,600
Why is the snowman facing this way?

856
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,300
I turned him...

857
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,000
...to even out his tan.

858
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,800
Was that Sid I heard talking on TV?

859
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,300
What was he talking about?

860
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,400
Nothing, really.

861
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,600
I saw him yesterday at the bank...

862
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,600
...and he told me
that you quit the team.

863
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,800
Charlie, you didn't tell me.

864
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,100
You want to talk?

865
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,100
About what?

866
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,600
I don't know.

867
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,600
This hockey thing...

868
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,600
...or how you're doing in school.

869
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,500
You tell me.

870
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
I'm trying to watch the weather.

871
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,900
Gabby, it'll be all right.
I'm here now.

872
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,800
Well...

873
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,300
...sort of.

874
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,700
Oh, boy.

875
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,300
I invented the backdoor escape,
okay? What's up?

876
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:06,100
Since you showed up, Mom thinks
I'm nuts, Rory Buck wants to kill me...

877
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,300
...and I'm pretty sure
my dad's a snowman.

878
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,200
So what's the problem?

879
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,800
I know yesterday was a rough day.
Things'll get better.

880
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,200
Quit following me.

881
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,700
You're a snowman!

882
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,800
People will see you and cut you up
into ice cube trays.

883
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,400
If that's the danger of hanging out
with you, I'll take the chance.

884
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,500
- Fine.
- Fine.

885
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,200
Really fine.

886
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,800
Fine as wine...

887
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,400
What?

888
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,300
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

889
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,000
I think we look kind of...

890
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,800
...you know, cute.

891
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,500
Somebody's going to hear you.

892
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,000
Check it out.

893
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,500
What's up with that?

894
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,600
Dude, he ditched us for a snowman.

895
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,400
I saw on the Geology Channel...

896
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,100
...they can actually turn pine cones
into a homemade explosive device.

897
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,100
How's your science
project coming?

898
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,200
What science project?

899
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,900
- The one about what it's like...
- Isn't that Charlie?

900
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,200
Hey, Mac.

901
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,700
Finally come in for
some Christmas lights?

902
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,400
I need a cup of that house paint
you call coffee.

903
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,200
You got it.

904
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,400
So what's going on?

905
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,400
Know when I promised not to bother
you for any talks with Charlie?

906
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,900
I lied.
I need you to talk to Charlie.

907
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,400
Nobody knows about this place.
I come here to think.

908
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Well, it's really cool.

909
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,800
I've been here a lot this year.

910
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:19,400
You know, Dad, I'm sorry
I gave you back the harmonica.

911
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,900
Don't worry about it.
You were mad. I'd be mad too.

912
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,600
Can I ask you why you
quit playing hockey?

913
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,200
- Hockey's not that great.
- Yeah, right.

914
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,100
The last person you see every night
is Wayne Gretzky on your wall.

915
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,900
Tell you what. We're here.
Let's work on the J-shot.

916
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,200
I don't think so.

917
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,800
I see. It's like that.

918
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,600
Looks like I'm working
out by myself...

919
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,000
...even though I haven't
played hockey in...

920
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
...a year.

921
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,000
I'll find a rock to use as a puck,
seeing as I'll be playing...

922
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,000
...all alone.

923
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,500
All right, all right, I'll skate.

924
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,700
Just stop bellyaching.

925
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,000
We'll get our nice balance.
We'll get set up.

926
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,500
Man, this was a lot easier
when I had legs.

927
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,600
We're going to stay nice and relaxed.
Real loose.

928
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,400
We come through. We snap our wrist.

929
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,800
Just before we do that...

930
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,900
...I make this little move here.

931
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,200
That goalie could sue me
for whiplash.

932
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,900
That's pretty cool.

933
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,800
A little thing I call the J-shot.

934
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,600
Now, let's play some hockey.

935
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,700
Are you looking for the power?

936
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,100
Then bring it, son.

937
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,900
That's a J-shot, dude!

938
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,000
- I did it!
- That's you! That's all you!

939
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,400
But I didn't score.

940
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,200
Life is full of setbacks.

941
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,800
Look at me.
I'm a snowdrift with arms.

942
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,800
You can give up, or you can
keep firing the puck, bud.

943
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,200
What do you think?

944
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,100
All right, give me the puck.

945
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,300
There's a lot of wood!

946
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,000
Fakes left, fakes right.

947
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,700
Man, nice shot. All right!

948
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,500
You got the...

949
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,500
All right!

950
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,500
- Dad, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

951
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,300
I think you got the J-shot.

952
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,700
I think you got the J-shot down.

953
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,800
All right, come on.
Let's go home.

954
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,200
Come on, come on.

955
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,400
You played great.

956
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,300
Thanks for teaching me the J-shot.

957
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,300
I want to see you use it.
You got to get back on the team.

958
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,900
- No, I don't think so.
- I do.

959
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,800
You're letting your friends
and yourself down.

960
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,800
- But wait a second...
- No "buts".

961
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,400
Let's talk about schoolwork.

962
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,800
What about it?

963
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I saw your report card.
You've got serious jamming to do.

964
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,100
What's this, a lecture?
Now you're giving me a lecture?

965
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,400
See? It's kind of scary.

966
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,800
Think how the snowman must feel.

967
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,000
And I'm worried about your mom.

968
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,700
- Why?
- Has she hung any Christmas lights?

969
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,000
Not a lot.

970
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,600
Yeah, I know. Hardly any.

971
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,400
Why are you telling me this?

972
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,400
You've got responsibilities now.

973
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,200
You'll just have to face them.

974
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,000
You got to watch out for Mom...

975
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,400
...and straighten things out
with your friends.

976
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,900
I'm only 1 2 years old.
I can't take all this!

977
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,300
I might have pushed it
a smidge too hard.

978
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,000
Hey, hon.

979
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,500
I'm heading to the Shiverfest.
You want to come along?

980
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,600
No, thanks.

981
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,400
Or if you'd rather,
you can come with me.

982
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,200
I'm going to go caroling with
Mrs. Wilkins and the neighbor ladies.

983
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,900
They did a good job this year.
Do you like the tree?

984
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,900
Want a balloon or anything?

985
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,600
Or pretzels? They've got...

986
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,500
Wow! Check out these snowmen.

987
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:25,000
Finals of the father-son snowman
building contest begin in 5 minutes.

988
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,600
Five minutes.

989
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,400
Mom thinks I'm going nuts, doesn't she?

990
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,000
No, no, no.

991
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,100
She's just a little concerned,
that's all.

992
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,700
So...

993
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,900
...what's going on?

994
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,400
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

995
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,400
Come on, let's check out the band.

996
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,300
Talk about a tough gig.
It's freezing out here.

997
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,200
Why don't you play music anymore?

998
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,200
I kind of lost the groove.

999
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,800
The groove?

1000
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,000
Playing with your dad, I never
thought about what music was.

1001
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,400
Music was life. It was...

1002
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,600
...just...

1003
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,400
...like breathing, really.

1004
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,700
So natural.

1005
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,900
After he died...

1006
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,000
...music became...

1007
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,600
...a job.

1008
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,400
You know, Jack always said to me:

1009
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,200
"It should never feel like work".

1010
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,800
He was your best friend, huh?

1011
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,300
Your dad was the real deal.

1012
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,800
Do you think he wanted me
to be a musician?

1013
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,900
More than anything, he wanted you to be
whatever you wanted to be.

1014
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,300
He didn't care what that was.

1015
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,500
Just whatever made you happy.

1016
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:07,600
Really?

1017
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,200
Really.

1018
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,000
Think you'll get the groove back?

1019
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,500
Someday, maybe.

1020
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,000
I hope so.

1021
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,600
Man, you got your shopping done, folks?

1022
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,800
You got 10 hours till Christmas Eve...

1023
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,200
...and it's already 55 degrees.

1024
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,000
Could get up to 70 today.

1025
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,500
Snowplow drivers got a day off.

1026
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,500
It's hot enough to melt a snowman.

1027
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,100
Although, you know,
good news for Sid Gronic.

1028
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,200
Speaking of hot,
here's a little Billy Idol for you.

1029
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,700
"Hot in the City"
on central Colorado's classic rock.

1030
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,400
Hey, man. Good morning.

1031
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,000
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what you said.

1032
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,100
You're right.

1033
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,800
The J-shot,
it wasn't just about hockey, was it?

1034
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,300
What do you think?

1035
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,400
There's something I got to do.

1036
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,100
Hey, guys.

1037
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,400
Hey, Coach.

1038
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,400
I'd like to get back on the team.

1039
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:54,800
What?

1040
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,000
You ditched us, Charlie.
Remember?

1041
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,800
Do we have to bring
your snowman buddy along too?

1042
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,300
There'll be no mention of snowmen
in this car.

1043
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I don't know, Charlie.

1044
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,600
Well, I do.

1045
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,300
I say we let him back on the team.

1046
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,000
Everybody deserves a second chance.

1047
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,800
Go get your stuff.

1048
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,400
Go, Charlie!

1049
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,600
They let me back on the team.

1050
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,000
Listen, Dad, about last night, I...

1051
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,500
It's okay, buddy.
What time they drop the puck?

1052
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:52,200
- 1 1 :30. But you don't got to come.
- I know that.

1053
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,000
He's talking to the snowman again.

1054
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,300
What'd I say, Tuck?

1055
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,800
Shake it, Charlie!

1056
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,600
Remember...

1057
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,700
...arms and wrists.

1058
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,400
Straight but relaxed.

1059
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,000
Thanks again, Dad.
See you after the game.

1060
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,900
Man, this sun is brutal.

1061
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,200
I mean, I am literally
melting my ass off.

1062
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,800
I didn't come
all the way from the hereafter...

1063
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,200
...to miss another one
of my kid's hockey games.

1064
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,000
Chet, listen.

1065
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,600
Chet, I know
we've had our differences...

1066
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,100
...but I got a game to catch.

1067
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,000
I really could use your help.

1068
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,600
So how are we going to do this?

1069
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,800
Go. Yes, Frost!

1070
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,200
He's good.

1071
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,600
Come on, okay. Here we go.
Come on.

1072
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,000
Maybe you got some friends
who are Huskies.

1073
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,100
You know a Saint Bernard?

1074
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,100
Score! One-nothing.

1075
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,900
And here we go again.

1076
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,900
That's right, Chet.
Take your time.

1077
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,900
Wonder if there's gonna be any
cute poodles there.

1078
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,000
That's what I thought!

1079
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,400
Good pass, Charlie!

1080
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,100
Go, Spencer! Go!

1081
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,800
He scored!

1082
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,400
Score by Spencer Jordan,
with an assist by Charlie Frost.

1083
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,200
Mountaineers, one.
Devils, one.

1084
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,200
Okay, so far, so good.

1085
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,500
Stay cool.

1086
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,200
Almost there.

1087
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,200
All right, Frost!

1088
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,600
Get it back!

1089
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,600
Go, Charlie. Go!

1090
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,500
Yes, Frost. Go!

1091
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,200
One hundred yards
of piping-hot asphalt.

1092
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,800
Bad day to be a snowman.

1093
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,800
This could really sting.

1094
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,700
Okay, baby steps, baby steps.

1095
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,100
Man, this is getting hot.
This is hot.

1096
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,900
This is hot on my tootsies.
My tootsies is burning.

1097
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,700
Holy habanero!

1098
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,100
This is hot.
Let's speed her up!

1099
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,300
Leaping Lawrence of Arabia!

1100
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,300
I am so hot!

1101
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,700
All right, all right, Frost!

1102
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,800
All right, Charlie!

1103
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,200
Turn it around!

1104
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,000
Frost, yes, go!

1105
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,200
The J-shot, Charlie-boy, come on!

1106
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,900
Arms and wrists.

1107
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,000
Straight but relaxed.

1108
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,100
Nice going, butthead!

1109
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,500
Outstanding! Yes!

1110
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,100
My man! Yes!

1111
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,400
You got the power!

1112
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,600
Way to go, Charlie.

1113
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,600
The ice is now open
for all free skates.

1114
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,900
Outstanding game.
What can I say?

1115
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,200
You rock, dude.

1116
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,800
You're melting.
You gotta be crazy to come here.

1117
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,200
I couldn't miss your big game.

1118
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,100
Let's get you on the ice
so you can cool off.

1119
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,000
That's not going to work.

1120
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,800
I got to get you someplace cold.
I won't lose you again.

1121
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,400
I'll be back!

1122
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,800
Someplace cold.

1123
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,400
Mom?

1124
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,000
No cutting!

1125
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,800
It's okay, ma'am.
He's my son.

1126
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,100
You need to drive us somewhere
right now.

1127
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,500
- Honey, I'm working.
- You've got to!

1128
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:08,500
What's wrong?

1129
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,200
- He's melting.
- Who's melting?

1130
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,500
The snowman's melting.

1131
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,000
That's just the way it is.

1132
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,600
If you drive us to the mountains,
he won't melt.

1133
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,100
I'm not driving you
and your snowman anywhere.

1134
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,400
I know this has been hard for you.

1135
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,300
You don't understand, Mom.

1136
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,200
Dad's the snowman.

1137
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,300
What?

1138
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,100
I'm sorry, but he made me promise
not to tell you.

1139
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,700
Honey, he died a year ago.

1140
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,500
You'll just have to accept that.

1141
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,700
No, Mom, you don't understand.

1142
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,700
It's gonna be okay, Dad.

1143
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,800
Do me a favor.
Watch out for snowplows.

1144
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,600
Charlie's run away with the snowman.

1145
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,400
Really.

1146
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,500
Oh, my!

1147
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,100
Look out! Move, move!

1148
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,700
Excuse me. Look out.

1149
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:45,300
- He could be anywhere.
- Mac, it's a kid and a snowman.

1150
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,700
You and me.
Once and for all.

1151
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,800
I'll fight you any other time.
Just not now.

1152
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,600
I don't know who's more stupider,
you or your snowman.

1153
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,000
Excuse me.
Did you just say "stupider"?

1154
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,200
What kind of word is "stupider"?

1155
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,000
Who said that?

1156
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,500
I did...

1157
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,000
...you little baggy-pants snow punk.

1158
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:35,800
What the heck is it?

1159
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,600
Not what. Who.

1160
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,100
And he's my dad.

1161
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,200
I knew it!

1162
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,000
Mitch and Pudge thought I was crazy.
But I saw you that day.

1163
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,800
You throw a mean snowball.

1164
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,200
Okay, okay, okay.
Just chill, kid.

1165
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,700
Don't have a meltdown.

1166
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,700
Look, Rory,
it's too hot down here.

1167
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,200
If I don't get him up to
the mountains, I'll lose him.

1168
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,700
He does look pretty bad.

1169
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,100
Come on.

1170
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,900
You know what it's like
not to have a dad.

1171
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,100
It sucks.

1172
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,700
It sucks big time.

1173
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,500
All right.

1174
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,700
Snowdad's better than no dad.

1175
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Let's go.

1176
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,000
Come on.

1177
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,600
Come on, let's go!

1178
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,200
That was good.
Merry Christmas.

1179
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:42,800
Come on.

1180
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,600
- Good Luck, Charlie!
- Thanks!

1181
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,200
Okay, what's the snowman look like?

1182
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,600
Like a snowman.
He looks like a snowman.

1183
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,200
Three balls, two stick arms,
a cute cork nose.

1184
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,000
What do you think he looks like?

1185
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,500
I'm trying to do my job, that's all.
Can you help me?

1186
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,400
Five-eight.

1187
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,600
White.

1188
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Caucasian.

1189
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,400
Stocky. He's sort of well-built.

1190
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,200
I'd say 500, 550 pounds.

1191
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,700
Could you estimate an age?

1192
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,600
We're here!

1193
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,400
Ready? On three.

1194
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,700
I'm with you, buddy.

1195
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,400
One...

1196
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,500
...two...

1197
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,600
...three!

1198
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,000
Fresh powder. My favorite!

1199
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,200
My balls are freezing.

1200
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,600
I never thought I'd say that
with a smile.

1201
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,000
Come on, Dad, let's go.

1202
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,100
Let's go get you warmed up, buddy.

1203
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,200
I was so busy trying to make my mark
on the world, I didn't...

1204
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,500
You are my mark on the world.

1205
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,200
Did you find him?

1206
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,400
Charlie's sleeping.

1207
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,100
He had one heck of a day.

1208
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,100
Who is this?

1209
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,000
Where's Charlie?

1210
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,400
He's right here at the cabin.

1211
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,700
Why don't you come get him?

1212
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,900
Jack?

1213
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,400
It's Christmas!

1214
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,700
Merry Christmas, Dad.

1215
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,500
Merry Christmas to you, bud.

1216
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,500
You know what?

1217
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:54,200
I think this is
the best Christmas I ever had.

1218
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,800
You know that night you came back?
It was because of your harmonica.

1219
01:26:59,100 --> 01:26:59,900
I wished it.

1220
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,800
I wished you would be here
for Christmas.

1221
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:06,100
Thanks for giving me a second chance
to be your dad.

1222
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,200
Now, there's something
I have to tell you.

1223
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,200
It's time for me to go.

1224
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,700
What?

1225
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,200
No. I'm not going to let you.

1226
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,700
You've got to get on with your life.

1227
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,700
No, come on.

1228
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,900
It'll get cold again, Dad.
You'll see.

1229
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,800
Winter's just barely started.

1230
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,200
And when it gets warm?

1231
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,500
We'll go to South America.

1232
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,200
Summer here is winter there.

1233
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,500
What about Mom?
Mom needs you.

1234
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,100
What if I need you?

1235
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,600
I will always be there.
I promise.

1236
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,200
As long as you hold someone
in your heart...

1237
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,900
...you can never lose them.
Ever.

1238
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:48,700
You let me back into your heart,
and that took real courage.

1239
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:52,200
You did it. And if you can
do that, you can do anything.

1240
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,500
I'm so proud of you.

1241
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,000
If you ever need me,
I'll be right here.

1242
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,900
You just call me.

1243
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,800
Here.

1244
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,200
I love you, Dad.

1245
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,200
I love you, Charlie.

1246
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,500
You're gonna be a good man.

1247
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,700
Okay now, let me go.

1248
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,800
Oh, honey!

1249
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,600
- I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
- It's okay.

1250
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,600
Oh, my God!

1251
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,100
You look so...

1252
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,100
You look so great.

1253
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,400
Sing me a smile, Jack.

1254
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,600
Every time

1255
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,900
We say goodbye I cry a little

1256
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,700
I love you so much, Gab.

1257
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,100
I love you too, Jack.

1258
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,200
Goodbye.

1259
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,400
Goodbye, Jack.

1260
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,500
Charlie-boy...

1261
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,000
...we had us a time, didn't we?

1262
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,200
Yeah, we did.

1263
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,000
Love you.

1264
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Bye, Dad.

1265
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,000
Goodbye.

1266
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:40,900
Bye.

1267
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,000
I will always hear you.
