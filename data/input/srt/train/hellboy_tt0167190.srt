1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,700
<i>What is it that makes a man a man?</i>

2
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,300
<i>Is it his origins,
the way things start?</i>

3
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,500
<i>Or is it something else,
something harder to describe?</i>

4
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,200
<i>For me, it all began in 1944.</i>

5
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,500
<i>Classified mission
off the coast of Scotland.</i>

6
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,900
<i>The Nazis were desperate.</i>

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,500
<i>Combining science and black magic...</i>

8
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,900
<i>...they intended to upset
the balance of the war.</i>

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,400
<i>I was 28, already a paranormal
advisor to President Roosevelt.</i>

10
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,900
<i>I could never have suspected
that what would transpire that night...</i>

11
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,900
<i>...would not only affect
the course of history...</i>

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,600
<i>...but change my life forever.</i>

13
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,200
All right, men, let's go. Move!

14
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,100
Come on! Come on! Come on!

15
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,300
Let's fan it out.

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,500
Your men...

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,500
...they'll need these.

18
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Are you a Catholic?

19
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,200
Yes. Among other things.
But that's hardly the point.

20
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, you're gonna need
one of these.

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,500
I abhor the use of violence.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Thank you. I wouldn't want you
to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.

23
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,900
No, three days too late for that,
Professor Broom.

24
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,100
All right, you guys,
let's move, move, move, move!

25
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,400
Come on boys, let's go!

26
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,000
This way! Left, right!

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Come on, men, let's get the lead out!

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
We're close!

29
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,600
You're wasting our time. There's
nothing here but sheep and rocks.

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,600
- Ruins, not rocks.
- Hold it right here!

31
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,200
The remains of Trondham Abbey,
built on an intersection of ley lines...

32
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
...the boundaries between
our world and the others...

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
What a load of crap!

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,700
Hell, a week ago, I never even heard
the word "parabnormal. "

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,900
Paranormal.

36
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,700
Move it!

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Hold the line.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,100
Come on!

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Sweet Jesus.

40
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,200
They must be here for the sheep.

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,300
The freak in the gas mask...

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,800
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,200
Hitler's top assassin
and head of the Thule Occult Society.

44
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,200
If he's here, this is worse
than I thought.

45
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,400
No matter what happens tonight...

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,400
...this book will guide you
back to me.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I will not leave you.

48
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,300
I grant you everlasting life...

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,600
...youth...

50
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,700
...and the power to serve me.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,900
Ilsa! Grigori!

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
It's time.

53
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,000
Five years of research
and construction, Grigori.

54
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,400
Five years!

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,800
The führer doesn't look kindly
on failure.

56
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,600
There will be no failure, general.

57
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,600
I promised Herr Hitler a miracle.

58
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,300
I'll deliver one.

59
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,900
What I will do tonight
can never be undone!

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,900
I will open a portal...

61
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,900
...and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:

62
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,600
The Seven Gods of Chaos!

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Our enemies will be destroyed!

64
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,000
And from the ashes...

65
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,400
...a new Eden will arise.

66
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,200
Get down!

67
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,300
I was taking a picture.

68
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,100
You do that again
and I'll carve you a new one.

69
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,300
Listen, the portal is open.

70
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,600
Do you understand?
We have to stop them.

71
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,300
Go! Go! Go! Go!

72
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Look out!

73
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,600
Get down!

74
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,500
It's almost over.

75
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,100
No, it's not.

76
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,400
The portal's been open for too long.

77
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,700
Something may have come through.

78
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
Have your men search
the area thoroughly.

79
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,900
Spread out over that way!

80
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,000
Sir! Something up here!

81
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,500
He's gone.

82
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
For now.

83
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,700
When you said something
came through...

84
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,700
From where?

85
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,200
I don't see them!

86
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,200
Do you really, really believe in hell?

87
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,400
There is a place,
a dark place...

88
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
...where ancient evil slumbers
and waits to return.

89
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,700
- Grigori gave us a glance tonight.
- Grigori?

90
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,300
That's Russian, right?

91
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,700
Grigori Efimovich Rasputin.

92
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,800
Rasputin?

93
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,400
- Come on!
- Occult adviser to the Romanovs.

94
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,200
In 1916, at a dinner in his honor...

95
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,100
...he was poisoned, shot,
stabbed, clubbed...

96
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,100
...castrated and finally drowned.

97
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,600
And yet, we saw him here tonight.

98
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Professor Broom.

99
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
Careful. Be careful.

100
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,800
- What the hell is that? An ape?
- No.

101
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,400
It was red. Bright red.

102
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Lower your light, you're scaring it.

103
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,100
- What are you two shooting at?
- A red ape!

104
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,700
No, it's not an ape.

105
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,600
It's got a big stone in its hand.

106
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,600
I think that is its hand.

107
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,900
Look at the size of that whammer.

108
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,700
No, wait! Wait!

109
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,300
A blanket. Get me a blanket.

110
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
Come on. Come on. It's safe.

111
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Jump down.

112
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,800
Come on. Jump down.

113
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,800
It's a boy.

114
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,800
It's just a baby boy.

115
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,600
Move to the left.

116
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,100
<i>There we were, an unready father
for an unwanted child.</i>

117
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,400
<i>The boys gave him a name
that very night.</i>

118
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,800
<i>In retrospect,
perhaps not the most fortunate.</i>

119
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>But nevertheless,
a name we all came to use.</i>

120
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,100
<i>We called him Hellboy.</i>

121
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,300
Look at the birdie.

122
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
<i>Speculation about the origins...</i>

123
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
<i>Evidence that Hellboy...</i>

124
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,800
<i>So, what is it exactly
that you say this agency does?</i>

125
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,100
<i>I kid you not. It hunts monsters.</i>

126
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,800
<i>The claim, of course,
that this creature...</i>

127
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,000
<i>...works for the FBI
as a monster hunter.</i>

128
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,200
What you seek is in there.

129
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,200
This is a sacred place.

130
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,600
Give me my gold.

131
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,000
We shouldn't be here.

132
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,500
Master.

133
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Your eyes.

134
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,300
What did they do to your eyes?

135
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,300
- Have you told him yet?
- No.

136
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,400
We should.

137
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,700
Malignant sarcoma.

138
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,900
In the lungs...

139
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,900
...the spine...

140
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,800
...liver.
- Approximately...

141
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,200
...how long?
- Maybe six weeks.

142
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,200
I can arrange for hospitalization
and pain management.

143
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,300
- Make the time more bearable.
- No.

144
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,600
I'd rather be at home.

145
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,400
I have some arrangements to make.

146
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,700
For my son.

147
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,600
You can always get
a second opinion.

148
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,900
That won't be necessary.

149
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Hurry up!

150
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
- Hurry up!
- Wait right here!

151
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,100
<i>Tom Manning is the head
of special operations at the FBI.</i>

152
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,900
<i>He joins Pat in the studio tonight
to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.</i>

153
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,700
There. That's the tail.

154
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
And these are the horns.

155
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,000
I have a question.

156
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,100
In the pictures of aliens, UFO,
the yeti, Hellboy...

157
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,900
...why is it they're always out of focus?

158
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,800
<i>Why don't you tell us...</i>

159
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,900
<i>...about the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense?</i>

160
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,100
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell
the American public one thing.

161
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,700
Now, this Bureau for the...

162
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,000
Paranormal Research and Defense.

163
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,300
There is no such thing.

164
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,500
"Waste Management Services"?

165
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,100
<i>What is it?</i>

166
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,200
John Myers, FBI.

167
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,400
Transfer from Quantico.

168
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,800
<i>Look at the birdie, son.</i>

169
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,900
- Hello. I'm John...
- You are late. That's what you are.

170
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
- Five minutes.
- Yes, I know.

171
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,700
- I'm going to...
- Section 51. I know.

172
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,100
Watch your hands and elbows.

173
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,700
- Pardon?
- Watch your hands and elbows.

174
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,300
Hello?

175
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,600
Turn the pages, please,
if you don't mind.

176
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,600
Please.

177
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,500
The pages.

178
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,200
These? You're reading these?

179
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,400
Four books at once, every day...

180
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
...as long as I'm there
to turn the pages.

181
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,000
My name's Broom.

182
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,700
Professor Trevor Broom.

183
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Sir, I'm John...

184
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,300
Agent John T. Myers,
Kansas City, '76.

185
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,600
T stands for Thaddeus,
mother's older brother.

186
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,900
Scar on your chin happened
when you were 10.

187
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,800
You still wonder if it's ever
going to fade away.

188
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,600
- How did it...?
- He.

189
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
Not "it. "

190
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,900
Abraham Sapien.

191
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,600
Discovered alive
in a secret chamber...

192
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,400
...of St. Trinian's
Foundling Hospital, Washington.

193
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,600
His name was taken
from this inscription...

194
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,300
...stuck to the side of his tank.
- "Icthyo Sapiens.

195
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,900
April 14, 1865."

196
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,800
The day that Abraham Lincoln died.

197
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,200
Hence, Abe Sapien.

198
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,700
Rotten eggs.

199
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,300
A delicacy. Abe loves them.

200
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,500
How does he know
so much about me?

201
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,800
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.

202
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,300
"Unique. " That's a word you'll hear
frequently around here.

203
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,800
Sir, where am I, exactly?

204
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,300
As you entered the lobby,
there was an inscription:

205
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,000
"In the absence of light,
darkness prevails. "

206
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,400
There are things that go bump
in the night, Agent Myers.

207
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,900
Make no mistake about that.

208
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,500
And we are the ones
who bump back.

209
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,600
1937, Hitler joins
the Thule Society...

210
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,400
...a group of German aristocrats
obsessed with the occult.

211
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,800
1938, he acquired
the Spear of Longinus...

212
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,600
...which pierced the side of Christ.

213
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,700
He who holds it becomes invincible.

214
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,700
Hitler's power increases tenfold.

215
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,500
1943, President Roosevelt
decides to fight back.

216
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,700
The Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense is born.

217
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,200
1958, the Occult Wars
finally come to an end...

218
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,800
...with the death of Adolf Hitler.

219
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,900
1945, you mean.

220
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,600
Hitler died in '45.

221
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,300
Did he, now?

222
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,500
Myers, this is Agent Clay.

223
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,000
Take his lead.

224
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,100
He'll make the introductions.

225
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,600
You're not coming?

226
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,300
I handpicked you from a roster of over
70 academy graduates.

227
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,800
Make me proud.

228
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,700
They're not speaking.

229
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,300
Professor Broom had him grounded.

230
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,700
Grounded? Who's grounded?

231
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,900
Okay. You saw the fish guy, right?

232
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,100
Oh, yeah. That was weird.

233
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,900
Yeah. Right.

234
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,200
Well, come on in.
Meet the rest of the family.

235
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,400
He gets fed six times a day.

236
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,000
He's got a thing for cats.

237
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,000
You'll be his nanny,
his keeper, his best friend.

238
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,700
He never goes out unsupervised.

239
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Who?

240
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,300
I hate those comic books.

241
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,400
They never get the eyes right.

242
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,600
Hellboy.

243
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
He's real.

244
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,800
60 years old by our count.
But he doesn't age like we do.

245
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,300
Think reverse dog years.
He's barely out of his 20s.

246
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,600
What's with the hair, Clay?

247
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,900
Finally got them implants, huh?

248
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,900
It'll fill in.

249
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,500
Who's the squirt?

250
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,400
Agent Myers is your new liaison.

251
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,500
I don't want him.

252
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,800
What, you get tired of me, Clay?

253
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,200
The candy. Give him the candy.

254
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,400
Oh, sir, I...

255
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,300
I have these for you.

256
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,700
Father's back?

257
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,400
- He still angry?
- Well, you did break out.

258
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,700
I wanted to see her.

259
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,600
- Nobody's business.
- It is. You got yourself on TV again.

260
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,400
Myers, huh?

261
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,100
You got a first name, Myers?

262
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,800
Try not to stare.
He hates it when people stare.

263
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,300
John. John Myers.

264
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Well, John'll do.

265
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,500
- Stare at what?
- His horns. He files them to fit in.

266
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,900
What you looking at, John?

267
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,100
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing.
Nothing at all.

268
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,500
<i>Code red.</i>

269
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Hey, hey, hey.

270
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,100
<i>Warning. Code red.</i>

271
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,500
They're playing our song.

272
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,200
Come on, champ,
let's go fight some monsters.

273
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,000
We're here at the Machen Library...

274
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,900
...where just hours ago,
an alarm was triggered.

275
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,900
The N.Y.P.D. has yet
to issue a statement.

276
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,300
We've got SWAT vans, paramedics.
You name it.

277
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
And now here comes
a garbage truck.

278
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
A large garbage truck.

279
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,400
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.

280
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,100
One sheet of glass
between them and us.

281
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,000
Story of my life.

282
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,400
Outside.
I could be outside.

283
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,400
You mean, outside with her.

284
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,600
Don't get psychic with me, fella.

285
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,500
Nothing psychic about it.

286
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,200
You're easy.

287
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,300
How am I gonna get a girl?
I drive around in a garbage truck.

288
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,500
Liz left us, Red.

289
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,300
Take the hint.

290
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,300
We don't take hints.

291
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,300
Civilians in bedroom.

292
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Okay, guys,
let's sync up our locators.

293
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,000
Seal the doors.
Red and Blue are coming in.

294
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,200
1900 hours, an alarm was tripped.

295
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,600
A large entity, type 5, reported.
Very aggressive.

296
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,800
Six guards dead.

297
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,700
I thought we checked this place.

298
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,300
Fakes and reproductions.

299
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,200
Apparently, not everything was fake.

300
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,300
Father.

301
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,900
The entity is still in there.

302
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,900
Video surveillance shows
a 16th-century statue was destroyed.

303
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.

304
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,900
- Who wards off demons.
- Exactly.

305
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,200
The statue, however, was hollow.

306
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,300
A reliquary.

307
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,100
A prison.

308
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,500
The Vatican deemed its occupant
dangerous enough...

309
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,100
...to include it on The List of Avignon,
of which, by the way, we hold a copy.

310
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,300
Perfect job for these babies.

311
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,000
Made them myself.

312
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,500
Holy water, clove leaf, silver
shavings, white oak. The works.

313
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,900
Behind this door, a dark entity.

314
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,200
Evil, ancient and hungry.

315
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,200
Oh, well.
Let me go in and say hi.

316
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,000
<i>You better hit the books,
Brother Blue.</i>

317
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,100
<i>We'll definitely need
more info on this one.</i>

318
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,400
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.

319
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,800
No. He likes it that way.

320
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,300
The whole "lonely hero" thing.

321
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,400
Hey, Stinky.

322
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,400
Kitchen's closed.

323
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,400
What you having?

324
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,000
Six library guards, raw,
plus belts and boots.

325
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,200
Man, you're gonna need
some heavy fiber to move that out.

326
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,100
<i>Red, I found something.</i>

327
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,200
This entity's name is Sammael,
the desolate one.

328
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,000
Son of Nergal, brother of...

329
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,300
Listen, Sammy...

330
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,800
...I'm not a very good shot, but The
Samaritan here uses really big bullets.

331
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,800
So, what do you say we work this out
in a nice, peaceful...

332
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,400
Oh, crap.

333
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,400
That's it for you, Sam.

334
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,300
<i>Red, you need to hear
the rest of the information.</i>

335
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,600
No, he's taken care of.

336
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,700
No, listen to this.

337
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,000
"Sammael, the desolate one,
lord of the shadows...

338
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,900
<i>...son of Nergal,
hound of resurrection... "</i>

339
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,300
See...

340
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,800
...I don't like that.

341
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,700
<i>What? Hound of resurrection?</i>

342
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,200
<i>"Harbinger of pestilence.
Seed of destruc... "</i>

343
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,700
Cut to the end. How do I kill it?

344
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,100
<i>Doesn't say.</i>

345
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,600
Go to the front. Let's go! Move!

346
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm going around the back.

347
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,700
Oh, crap.

348
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,500
Child.

349
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,900
All grown up, I see.

350
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,700
That voice.

351
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,400
It was the first lullaby
you ever heard, my son.

352
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,900
I ushered you into this world.

353
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,800
I alone know your true calling,
your true name.

354
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,600
Name this.

355
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,500
- That thing. That thing.
- What do you think you're doing?

356
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,100
- What do you think you're doing?
- Helping you. L...

357
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,700
Nobody helps me!

358
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,300
It's my job.

359
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,700
You want to help? Here.
Load this.

360
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.

361
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Jesus, what's that on your arm?

362
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,900
Oh, crap.

363
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,200
What the hell is that thing?

364
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,100
Let me go ask.

365
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,800
All right, keep coming.
Good. Keep coming.

366
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,500
Why, you little...

367
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,800
Wait!

368
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,700
We're heading toward civilians.

369
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,100
Crazy costumes, huh?
Trick or treat.

370
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,800
Red means stop!

371
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,600
- You all right?
- Yeah.

372
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,700
Stay here.

373
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,500
Sammy, you got a leak.

374
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,300
Waiting for me, chunk-face?

375
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,100
What the...?

376
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,300
- I'm on your side.
- Sure.

377
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,300
That's right!

378
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,700
Open wide!

379
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,100
Son of a...

380
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,700
Yuck!

381
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,600
Screw this.

382
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,200
I'm fireproof.

383
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
You're not.

384
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Hey, Myers.

385
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,700
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

386
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,500
<i>How's your arm?</i>

387
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,700
Yeah, my arm's fine.
Where are you?

388
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,700
I just fried Stinky.

389
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,400
Listen...

390
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,200
...tell Father I'll be home...

391
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,700
<i>...but he shouldn't wait up.</i>

392
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,200
No. No, wait, wait.

393
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,800
<i>Yeah, I gotta go with you.</i>

394
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,400
- Hey, Myers.
- Yeah?

395
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,000
Bye.

396
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,800
Damn it.

397
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,600
Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.

398
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,200
Die in peace...

399
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,700
...and be reborn again and again.

400
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,800
Only seven more days
till the eclipse.

401
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,900
The child will be there,
and so will we all.

402
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
Won't we?

403
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,300
There's a big, red man down there.

404
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,200
That's fine, darling.
Santa's not here for another month.

405
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,900
Not Santa.

406
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,900
Well, who, then?

407
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,100
I brought beer.

408
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,300
Oh, Red, your arm.

409
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,900
You better get that looked at.

410
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,200
I wanted to see you.

411
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,300
Every time the media gets
a look at him, they run to me.

412
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
I'm running out of lies, Trevor.

413
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,600
- I thought you like being on TV.
- I do.

414
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,400
So how many escapes
this year alone? Five.

415
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,700
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.

416
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,000
Your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red,
has a tail and is government-funded.

417
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,300
I know where to find him.

418
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,400
- I'll get him back.
- Hey, fish stick.

419
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,700
Don't touch anything.

420
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,000
I need to touch it to see.

421
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,200
- See what?
- Past, future.

422
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,700
Whatever this object holds.

423
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,900
Is he serious?

424
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,900
Don't worry about fingerprints.
Never had any.

425
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,800
Professor, they were here.

426
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,200
Who was here? Nixon? Houdini?

427
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,200
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?

428
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,900
Show me, Abe.
Show me what happened here.

429
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,700
<i>This is east-wing check-in.
We're all clear.</i>

430
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,700
<i>Also, make sure it's all locked up
over there in the annex.</i>

431
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,900
<i>Roger that.</i>

432
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,300
Kroenen!

433
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,300
Move.

434
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,900
Move!

435
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,400
There he is!

436
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,400
We'll cover him from here!

437
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,600
All right, don't move! Put that down.

438
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,600
Put down the weapon!

439
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Get them.

440
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,600
Drop the weapon.

441
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,400
On the ground!

442
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,100
Last warning!

443
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,500
Take him out!

444
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,400
Now, ready the welcome, my love.

445
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,700
Salt gathered from the tears
of a thousand angels.

446
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Restraining the essence...

447
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,300
...of Sammael, the hellhound.

448
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,400
The seed of destruction.

449
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,500
This I can promise, Sammael.

450
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,400
For each one of you that falls...

451
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,000
...two shall arise.

452
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,200
- Professor.
- I'm all right.

453
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,400
Professor.

454
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,800
You...

455
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,500
You are very sick.

456
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,700
I don't want Hellboy to know.

457
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,100
Sixty years ago,
they tried to destroy the world.

458
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,700
They're back.

459
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,700
In my lifetime, they're back...

460
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,600
...to finish the job.

461
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,200
We miss you at the bureau.

462
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,500
Abe's crazier every day.

463
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,800
Father's still mad at me.

464
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,500
Come back, Liz.

465
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,400
- Come back.
- No. No, H.B.

466
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,600
No, not this time.

467
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,700
I don't like it here...

468
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,000
...but I haven't had an episode
in months.

469
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,500
And you know what?

470
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,600
I'm learning to control it.

471
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,100
I'm learning where it comes from.

472
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,800
For the first time in my life...

473
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,800
...I'm not afraid.

474
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,400
- Looks like your ride is here.
- Have escort stand by.

475
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,300
The Nanny Squad.

476
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,100
Hey, stop. Wait. Wait.

477
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,500
Sir, may I go first?

478
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,300
Hang on a minute.

479
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,800
He barely knows him.

480
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Then he should make it his business
to change that.

481
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,500
Listen, H. B...

482
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,100
...I've got a chance out here.

483
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,900
So if you really care about me...

484
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,800
...you won't come back.

485
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,900
Yeah...

486
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,600
...I gotta go too.

487
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,500
Lots to do.

488
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,300
What took you so long?

489
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,900
Come on, time to go home.

490
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,000
Tape you up.

491
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,800
What are you, a Boy Scout?

492
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,600
- Nope, I never was.
- Well, you could have fooled me.

493
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,400
Hey, Red.

494
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,300
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.

495
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,800
This is nothing.

496
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,600
You know what'll kill me, don't you?

497
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,800
Okay, Red, let's get you home.
Come on.

498
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,600
You were burned
by some organic acid.

499
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,200
I'm lucky that way.

500
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,400
- I worry about you.
- Me?

501
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,100
Well...

502
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,600
...I won't be around forever,
you know.

503
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,800
Damn!

504
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,100
Could you please be a little careful?

505
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,500
Big baby.

506
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,500
How long was it latched onto you?

507
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,200
I don't know. About five seconds.

508
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,700
- Professor, look.
- Is it bad?

509
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,300
Touched you five seconds,
laid three eggs.

510
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,300
Didn't even buy me a drink.

511
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,100
The stinger detaches itself from
the tongue and injects the eggs.

512
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,000
They are very sensitive
to heat and light.

513
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,200
They need a humid,
dark environment to breed.

514
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,100
Did you ever lose track of him?

515
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,200
Well, let's see.

516
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,300
There was that moment when
I had the train on top of my head.

517
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,900
We can't risk it.

518
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,400
Tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks
with a group of agents.

519
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,100
Search the whole place
top to bottom.

520
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,400
Find those eggs and destroy them.

521
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,800
"Elizabeth Sherman. "

522
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,100
<i>I don't like the term "fire-starter. "</i>

523
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,100
<i>I just don't.</i>

524
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,700
<i>And "pyrokinesis" sounds like
some psychosis or something.</i>

525
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,900
<i>I don't know.</i>

526
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,000
<i>Maybe that's right.</i>

527
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,400
<i>Not being able to let go.</i>

528
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,800
<i>It's scary.</i>

529
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,900
<i>I black out after each episode.
Sometimes for hours.</i>

530
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,700
<i>You hear about so and so...</i>

531
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,200
<i>...who just lost control
and just exploded.</i>

532
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,000
<i>Well, they're lucky it isn't true.</i>

533
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,300
<i>With me, it is.</i>

534
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,500
My master is calling
your name now, my girl.

535
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,800
You must return to the child.

536
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,900
So once again...

537
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,500
...dream...

538
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,000
...of fire.

539
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,200
Hey, freak!

540
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,100
Get back here, freak!

541
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,800
- Let's get her!
- Get her!

542
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,200
- Get her, guys!
- Watch this!

543
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,600
Freak!

544
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,700
Oh, no! Not again.

545
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,400
Oh, no! Somebody!

546
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,900
Help me!

547
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,200
Help me, somebody! Help me!

548
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,400
How many buildings
does she have to burn down?

549
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,300
She belongs here.

550
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,800
That's not what she feels.

551
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,300
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.

552
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,700
Professor, the girl you're...

553
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Professor,
that girl you're talking about...

554
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,900
Hey, Boy Scout...

555
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,100
...think twice.

556
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,100
No, listen, I read her file.

557
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
- "Read her file. "
- She blames herself...

558
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,800
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh.
Look, I think I can help.

559
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,200
I could talk to her.

560
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,200
I think I could bring her back.

561
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,900
Just what was it that landed you
this job pushing "pamcakes," huh?

562
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,500
What was it?

563
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,700
Punctuality?
The way you part your hair?

564
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,700
What is your area of expertise?

565
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,800
<i>He doesn't want me with him.</i>

566
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,300
I know that much.

567
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,600
- You're doing fine.
- No, I'm not.

568
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,900
Look, he respects Clay, not me.

569
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,300
I'm really sorry, okay?

570
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,700
I'm not your guy.

571
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,400
I'm dying, Agent Myers.

572
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,500
Like any father, I worry about him.

573
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,500
In medieval stories,
there is often a young knight...

574
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,000
...who is inexperienced...

575
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,500
...but pure of heart.
- Come on.

576
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,800
Look, I am not pure of heart.

577
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,400
Yes, you are.

578
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,900
Rasputin is back for him.

579
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,800
What I ask of you...

580
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,900
...is to have the courage
to stand by him when I am gone.

581
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,200
He was born a demon.
Can't change that.

582
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,300
But you will help him...

583
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,800
...in essence...

584
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,900
...to become a man.

585
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,700
Pull that down.

586
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,800
<i>She was making great progress...</i>

587
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,000
...and now this.

588
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,100
We'll be closed for months.

589
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,500
And it put a big dent
in our Thorazine supply.

590
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,000
She's been like this
since it happened.

591
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,300
Are you sure you want to go in?

592
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,500
Miss Sherman?

593
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,300
I'm Agent Myers, FBI.

594
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,300
Miss Sherman?

595
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,700
Can I call you Liz?

596
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,200
It's a beautiful name.

597
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,900
Sixty percent of all the women
in the world are named Liz.

598
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,600
Well, it's impressive by my standards.
My name's John.

599
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,300
John T. Myers.

600
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,200
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you
back to the bureau.

601
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,900
No special precautions,
no security escorts.

602
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,500
Just you and me in a taxi
like regular folks.

603
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,100
That doesn't sound like him.

604
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,500
Well, Miss Sherman,
he's asking you back...

605
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,800
...but it's entirely your choice,
you know?

606
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,500
Choice, huh?

607
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,400
That's cute.

608
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,800
I've quit the bureau 13 times.

609
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,100
I always go back.

610
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,400
Where else would I go?

611
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,900
Over here.

612
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,600
You said those eggs need it
dark and humid?

613
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,700
Well, they hit the jackpot.

614
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:05,100
The subway lines,
they all converge right around here.

615
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,600
Right below us
is the old Vandeveer reservoir.

616
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,400
It was abandoned in the mid-30s.

617
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,100
There's a pulse.

618
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,000
There. A cistern on the other side.

619
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,400
Most of the eggs are there.

620
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,700
There's no way in.

621
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,000
We should go back and request
a special permit, type 2...

622
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,100
You guys coming or what?

623
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,400
We lead a charmed life.

624
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,100
Here you are, doctor.

625
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,200
This should cover your tail fin.

626
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.

627
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,400
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

628
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,100
Remind me why I keep doing this.

629
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,700
Rotten eggs
and the safety of mankind.

630
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,100
This doesn't really look
like doll's hair.

631
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,900
Be honest, Red. What do you think?

632
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,800
I'm thinking about doing it myself.

633
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,600
Hey, you guys find anything?

634
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,700
<i>No eggs yet, Red.</i>

635
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,600
<i>What, are you on a lunch break?</i>

636
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,100
Nothing here.

637
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,300
Red's on the move. I'll cover him.

638
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,600
Damn it, Red.

639
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Hey, it's Abe.

640
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,800
Oh, God.

641
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,000
Bring your toy over here.

642
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,800
Oh, man.

643
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,900
Oh, Jesus.

644
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,500
There's only one. I'll fry him quick.

645
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,700
Two. There were two.

646
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,700
Red?

647
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,600
Red. Come in, Red.

648
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,900
What's your 20? I got no signal.
Where the hell are you?

649
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,300
<i>It's like Swiss cheese in here.</i>

650
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,700
Sit tight, pal, I'm on him.

651
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,800
Sammael, hound of the resurrection.

652
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,100
Didn't I kill you already?

653
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,800
You goddamn monster!

654
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,200
Oh, crap.

655
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,200
It's for you!

656
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,200
You shouldn't hurt people!

657
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,300
You missed.

658
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,500
Hey, chunk-face.

659
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,500
You can do better than that,
big monster like you.

660
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,800
My kittens! Please!

661
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,700
Somebody, please, get my kittens!

662
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,500
Second date.

663
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,900
No tongue.

664
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,400
My kittens. Careful with them!

665
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,500
Lady, give me a break!

666
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Thank you.

667
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,600
My job.

668
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,500
<i>Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.</i>

669
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,600
Buddy, don't take another step.

670
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,600
Clay.

671
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,300
Man down. I need an ambulance
right away. Do you read me?

672
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,000
Hang in there, pal.

673
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,700
Man down.
Do you read? Do you read?

674
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,200
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?

675
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,700
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Man down!

676
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,200
Feels good to be outside.
It's been so long.

677
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,800
You know that's...
That's not safe Miss Sherman.

678
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,700
Please stay in the car.

679
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:05,800
No, no. Miss Sherman. Please,
can you come down, Miss Sherman?

680
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,500
Nice view.

681
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:20,200
Hey, a smile, huh?
Yeah, that's good.

682
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,300
Here.

683
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,400
Damn.

684
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:30,300
- You'll have to take another one later.
- Yeah.

685
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,900
He'll make it.

686
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,900
Not everyone was so lucky.

687
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,800
We had two agents die today.

688
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,800
Clay probably won't survive
the night.

689
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,500
- Not now, Manning, please.
- My problem with you:

690
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,500
You're reckless.

691
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,900
These men trusted you
to lead them as a team.

692
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,900
Where were you?

693
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,400
I knew those men
better than you did.

694
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,300
- That makes it all right, then.
- No, it doesn't make it all right.

695
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,800
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

696
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,200
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.

697
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,500
You have an insight.
You know monsters.

698
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,900
What are you trying to say?

699
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,300
This whole thing is a farce.

700
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,600
Because in the end...

701
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,500
...after you've killed, after you've
captured every freak out there...

702
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,000
...there's still one left.

703
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,300
You.

704
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,200
Hey, Manning.

705
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,900
I wish I could be more gracious, but...

706
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,300
Welcome back.

707
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,400
It's only for the weekend,
Professor Broom.

708
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,600
Then I shall be on my way.

709
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,700
Oh, you should have a look around.

710
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,100
We made some changes
around here.

711
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,800
I want that thing locked up,
starting now.

712
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,600
Right now! Do you...?

713
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,700
Now, you hear me?

714
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,700
- Locked up!
- Nothing's changed.

715
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,000
Home sweet home.

716
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,500
Liz?

717
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,500
Liz!

718
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,200
You did it, buddy. You did it!

719
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,200
Myers?

720
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,400
Pop?

721
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,300
Hey, how you doing?

722
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,400
Hey, what's that on your wrist?

723
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,000
This?

724
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,300
- It's something I learned in therapy.
- Yeah?

725
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,400
I'm depressed, one rubber band.

726
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,100
I'm impatient...

727
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,100
...two rubber bands.

728
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,000
Maybe...

729
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,400
Maybe I should get you
a fresh pack.

730
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,300
Yeah, maybe two.

731
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,700
Yeah, maybe.

732
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,700
I'm gonna put these over here, okay?

733
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,100
One minute. One minute.

734
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,900
Hey, Myers...

735
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,100
...you're a talker.

736
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,600
What's a good word,
a solid word, for "need"?

737
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,700
Well...

738
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,900
..."need" is a good, solid word.

739
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,200
Too needy.

740
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,700
Start in, okay?
You got nachos coming.

741
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,500
Nachos.

742
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,300
Oh, my God.

743
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,200
Look at them all.

744
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,900
Who had babies?

745
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:18,400
Liz, there's something I need
for you to hear, and it's...

746
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,800
Will it take long?
Because I'm actually going out.

747
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,500
Out?

748
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:25,900
"Out" out?

749
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:30,300
Yeah. Yeah, for a cup of coffee,
but go ahead, read.

750
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,800
Are you going alone?

751
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,600
No, Myers is taking me.

752
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,900
Hey, your chili's getting cold.

753
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,300
Not hungry.

754
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,300
Is there something
you'd like me to hear?

755
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,100
- It's just a list. It's not finished.
- Okay.

756
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,100
Well, then, later.

757
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,500
See you.

758
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,800
- Anything else you need?
- Not from you.

759
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,800
Well, good night.

760
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,100
Goodbye.

761
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,600
Subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

762
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,800
Born in Munich, 1897.

763
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,500
Suffered from
a masochistic compulsion...

764
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,500
...commonly known
as surgical addiction.

765
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:29,100
Both eyelids surgically removed...

766
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,000
...along with his upper...

767
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,900
...and lower lip.

768
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:42,500
The blood in his veins
dried up decades ago.

769
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:47,300
Only dust remains.

770
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,400
What horrible will...

771
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:57,200
...could keep such a creature
as this alive?

772
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,600
Oh, no.

773
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,300
Come on, Red.

774
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,900
Jesus.

775
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:48,000
Damn it, Red. Not again

776
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,000
And one of those cookies.
Do you have any doughnuts?

777
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,400
Sorry, pal. How about a bear claw?

778
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,500
Do you want anything else?
The shop's closing.

779
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,300
Here we go.

780
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,200
Listen about...

781
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,100
I admire him. He's a force of nature.

782
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,800
What are you two talking about?

783
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:27,000
What is so fascinating,
so important?

784
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,500
No. He's determined, unstoppable.

785
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,500
Some people would call that cocky.

786
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,100
- He's just strong.
- Yeah. That he is.

787
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,600
Hey, I've got yours.

788
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,900
My uncle, he used to say
we like people for their qualities...

789
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,100
...but love them for their defects.

790
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,700
He loves you, you know.

791
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,300
What about you?

792
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,600
I don't know. I grew up with him.

793
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,200
But now every time I see him,
I get confused.

794
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,100
There's hardly a day that goes by
that he's not in my mind.

795
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,300
Even now...

796
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,500
...I feel like he's here.

797
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,400
Hey, wait up.

798
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,600
You like doughnuts? I got two.

799
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,100
- Thanks. That was nice.
- I got a cookie, as well.

800
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,400
- Sugar?
- No. No sugar. Thank you.

801
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,900
No cream and sugar, moron.
She takes it black.

802
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,200
- I got some milk here.
- No. I'm okay. I don't take milk.

803
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,100
Told you.

804
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,200
She took his picture.

805
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,800
Damn!

806
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,600
She took his picture.

807
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,500
She took his picture.

808
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,700
She took his picture.

809
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,100
Oh, crap.

810
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,700
It's freezing, isn't it?

811
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,100
Coffee's warming me up.

812
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,000
Well, what do we do now?

813
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:10,500
Newark, New Jersey,
entertainment capital of the world.

814
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,900
- You sound like a game-show host.
- Hi.

815
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,500
Hey.

816
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,900
You're Hellboy.

817
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,400
I'm on a mission.

818
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:30,500
All right, tell me something about you.
Where do you come from?

819
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,800
I lived with my uncle most of my life.

820
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:36,500
Then I went to Quantico, went to top
of my class. I'm nothing like...

821
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,000
Don't tell anyone, huh?

822
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,600
Attaboy.

823
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,800
Sir, he left his locator.

824
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:57,100
- Shall we send out some scouts?
- Enough, enough, enough.

825
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,000
He'll never change.

826
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,800
A child.

827
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,300
Always a child.

828
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:24,600
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

829
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,300
Moscow.

830
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,300
Who wants us in Moscow?

831
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,100
- My mom baked them.
- She's laughing.

832
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,600
She's sitting on a park bench,
and she's laughing.

833
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,500
That's it. I'm done.

834
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,700
They don't look like spies.

835
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,400
Are you kidding me?

836
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,300
Look at this guy.

837
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,100
Those shady little eyes,
that phony grin.

838
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,000
- Are you going to eat that?
- No.

839
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,600
Hey, he's yawning. He's bored.

840
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,200
Yeah, the old yawning trick.

841
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,700
Watch his arm.

842
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,500
First he wants my job,
then he wants my girl.

843
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,200
Hey, we all have a side
that we try to hide.

844
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,800
God...

845
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,700
Hey, what the hell?

846
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,000
Hey! Hey, who threw that?

847
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

848
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,000
Nice shot.

849
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:35,500
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

850
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,700
It's Rasputin's mausoleum.

851
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,300
I see the puppet.

852
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,200
But where is...

853
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,600
...the puppeteer?

854
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,600
Very good, Professor Broom.

855
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,800
It was you.

856
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,400
The scraps of paper...

857
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,200
...Liz's sudden relapse and return.

858
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,200
Bread crumbs on the trail.

859
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,100
Like in a fable.

860
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
They both distract him...

861
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,200
...and guide him exactly
where I need him.

862
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,500
Moscow.

863
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,500
His destiny.

864
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,200
And the last clue...

865
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,400
...will be left by
the late Professor Broom.

866
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,100
You raised the child.

867
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,100
Nurtured him.

868
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,300
So in return...

869
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,200
...I will permit you...

870
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:34,000
...a brief, brief glimpse of the future.

871
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,300
<i>He will open the portal...</i>

872
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,200
<i>...and bring about
the end of the world.</i>

873
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,700
<i>If only you had had him destroyed
60 years ago...</i>

874
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,000
<i>...none of this would have
come to pass.</i>

875
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,400
<i>But then,
how could you have known?</i>

876
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,400
<i>Your God chooses to remain silent.</i>

877
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,400
Mine lives within me.

878
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,000
Every time I died and crossed over...

879
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,100
...a little more of the master...

880
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:35,400
...came back with me.

881
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,300
He disclosed to me
the child's true name.

882
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:41,900
Would you like to know it?

883
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,700
I know what to call him.

884
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,100
Nothing you can do or say...

885
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,400
...can change that.

886
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,100
I call him...

887
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,500
...Son.

888
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,600
I'm ready.

889
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,800
It'll be quick.

890
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,500
Just go there
and tell her how you feel.

891
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,700
My mom says that...

892
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,800
Look, it's not...
It's not that easy, okay?

893
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,400
Plus, you're 9.

894
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,400
You're not old enough
to be giving me advice.

895
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,900
- All right, stand by.
- Who are those guys?

896
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:06,000
Liz, I'm sorry. It's Broom.
Let's go. We need to find him.

897
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,900
- No!
- Wait, what happened?

898
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,300
- No!
- It's okay.

899
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,800
No, not him.

900
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,900
- Would you take her?
- Something's wrong.

901
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,200
<i>He hasn't spoken to anybody
in three days.</i>

902
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,300
Not a word.

903
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:05,000
He won't eat, he won't sleep.

904
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,600
I've never seen him like this.

905
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,600
Never.

906
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,100
Should I stay?

907
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,700
With him, I mean?

908
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,700
Listen, I'm not much
of a problem solver.

909
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:25,300
Three decades,
I've only completed two sides.

910
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,700
But I do know this much.

911
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,000
If there's trouble...

912
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:33,000
...all us freaks have is each other.

913
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,600
And I'm stuck here.

914
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,300
So...

915
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,800
...take care of the big monkey for me,
will you?

916
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:25,400
I have accumulated many objects
of great interest...

917
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,400
...preserving our heritage.

918
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,600
Many, like me,
believe Mother Russia...

919
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:38,200
...to be very close
to a historic rebirth.

920
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,600
"Rebirth"?

921
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,600
I like that.

922
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,400
Twenty tons of stone.

923
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,400
This thing fell from the sky
into Tunguska Forest.

924
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,300
June 30th, 1908.

925
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,600
The Romanovs took possession
of it immediately.

926
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,700
I've wanted it for ages.

927
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,200
You're aware, of course...

928
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:08,000
...there's no way you'll get it out
of Russian territory.

929
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:12,500
He is aware.
Our guests are coming in.

930
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:16,700
Volokolamsk Fields, 50 miles from
Moscow, that's where we're going.

931
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:21,000
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
That's the only clue we have.

932
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,700
We've collected
and destroyed thousands of eggs...

933
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:27,700
...but we have no trace of this
Sammael or this Rasputin character.

934
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:31,200
We leave as soon
as we get clearance and equipment.

935
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,900
Hellboy's coming.

936
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,400
I'm not pleased about that,
but I'll be in charge this time.

937
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:41,000
We either wrap this up or I'm closing
this freak show for good.

938
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,900
Hi.

939
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,200
Hi.

940
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,500
I'll...

941
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,500
...come to Moscow...

942
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,900
...if you're still going.

943
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,400
I am.

944
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,200
But I have something to say.

945
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,900
I understand
what you don't like about me.

946
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,200
I do.

947
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,000
What I am...

948
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,000
...makes you feel
a little out of place...

949
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,400
...out there.

950
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,900
- Red, I don't...
- Listen.

951
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,900
I'm not like Myers.

952
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,300
He makes you feel like you belong...

953
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,600
...which is good, really.

954
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,800
I wish I could do something about this.

955
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,400
I can't.

956
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,700
I can promise you two things:

957
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,300
One, I'll always look this good.

958
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,000
And two...

959
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,200
...I'll never give up on you.

960
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,900
Ever.

961
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,500
I like that.

962
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,000
This engraving here
represents Sammy. Text reads:

963
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,600
"One falls, two shall arise. Sammael. "

964
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,800
We'll have to nail them all at once,
and the eggs.

965
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,900
And when we do, no mumbo jumbo.

966
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,000
Double-core Vulcan-65 grenades.

967
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,300
We've installed a handy little timer.
You set it, you walk away.

968
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,300
Cable pulls the safety pins.

969
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,500
Kaboom.

970
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,800
Easy to clean, easy to use.

971
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,400
Sparky to Big Red.
Do you read me? Come in.

972
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,300
"Sparky"?

973
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,700
<i>Who came up with that? Myers?</i>

974
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:11,900
<i>Yeah, we're leaving the main road,
so hang on.</i>

975
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
This better be the place or I'll puke.

976
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:22,500
You better come out and see.

977
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:38,000
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

978
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:51,400
Forget it. We're never gonna find
Rasputin's mausoleum.

979
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,800
It's practically a city.

980
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:56,200
And it stinks, and it's muddy.

981
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:01,200
I think we go back, we check
into the hotel, we regroup.

982
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,000
After breakfast.

983
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:06,600
I think what we have to do here
is we have to make a grid.

984
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:11,600
We go in by quadrants.
Maybe satellite photography.

985
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:16,700
Let me ask for directions.

986
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,700
Where are you going?

987
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:34,000
Come on, baby, find me a talker.

988
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:52,900
Hi there.

989
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,900
Come on.

990
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,000
Come on.

991
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,100
Come on.

992
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,200
What do you want?

993
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,800
This is ridiculous.

994
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,400
I run this show, not him.

995
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,200
This guy's nothing but trouble.

996
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:35,700
- Ten minutes, we're out of here.
- Will you shut up...

997
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,800
...and let him do his thing?

998
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,700
Anybody got a PowerBar?

999
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,800
Hey, there he is.

1000
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:49,100
Sixty feet further, comrades.

1001
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,400
And three rows in.

1002
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,200
What the hell is that on his back?

1003
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:57,600
This here is Ivan Klimentovich.

1004
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,400
Say "hi," Ivan.

1005
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,000
Go that way, Red Monkey!

1006
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,100
Gotcha.

1007
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,800
Ivan says there's a whole network
of tunnels down here.

1008
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,100
Goes on for miles.

1009
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,500
Stay close, everybody.

1010
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,600
You better be right about this.

1011
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,400
We'll be all right as long as
we don't separate.

1012
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,700
Hey, Sparky.

1013
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,400
Tell everyone to turn their locator
belts on. Anybody sees anything...

1014
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,600
I'll say "Marco. "

1015
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:04,800
Polo.

1016
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:08,400
<i>- Are you sure about this?
- On a scale of one to ten: two.</i>

1017
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:12,100
Don't worry, Boy Scout,
she'll take care of you.

1018
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,700
<i>She's a tough one.</i>

1019
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,200
Come on.

1020
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,400
Ask your buddy
how far this thing goes.

1021
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,500
How you doing up there, Ivan?

1022
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,100
If I had legs I'd kick your ass!

1023
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:55,700
Would you mind holding this guy
for a while? He is so negative.

1024
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,500
What the hell is that?

1025
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,100
Something big.

1026
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,000
- Lime, come with me.
- Right.

1027
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:26,400
No, no, no. Stay put!

1028
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:30,400
Stop!

1029
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,700
You listen to me.

1030
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:33,900
Listen to me!

1031
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:35,900
I'm in charge.

1032
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:39,000
We're gonna go back.
You can take that door apart.

1033
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:42,600
Whatever it is, it's coming for us.
Now, we gotta move forward!

1034
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,000
Lime, let's go!

1035
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,700
Stay put!

1036
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,100
And you! I am not afraid of you!

1037
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,000
I'm in charge! We go back!

1038
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:02,600
I was better off dead!

1039
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:27,100
Oh, crap.

1040
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,700
Music.

1041
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:43,800
Really went deep.

1042
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,700
Hey, what's wrong with you?!

1043
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,200
You killed my father.

1044
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,500
Your ass is mine.

1045
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,500
What are you laughing at,
you Nazi son of a...?

1046
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:58,100
Don't even think about it.

1047
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:21,100
That's all for you, pinhead.

1048
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,600
What are you doing?

1049
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:33,300
- What are you doing?
- Having a...

1050
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,100
You never light a cigar that way.

1051
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,700
You use a wooden match.

1052
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:41,200
Preserves the flavor. You see?

1053
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:51,400
Thank you.

1054
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,200
Thank you.

1055
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:02,400
So he thinks you and I...

1056
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:05,500
That's why he's mad at me.

1057
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,500
But it's not true, right?

1058
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:16,100
What?

1059
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,400
Well, that, you know,
you feel that way about me.

1060
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:23,000
You want to know that here? Now?

1061
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:28,400
Yeah.

1062
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,500
Red, white, whatever.
Guys are all the same.

1063
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,300
Hey, wait up.

1064
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,100
<i>Have you found them yet?</i>

1065
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:43,100
<i>I got them right below me.
It's a matter of minutes.</i>

1066
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,800
Okay, good.

1067
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:50,900
Could you hurry up?
Because it's a little spooky in here.

1068
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,500
Liz, wait.

1069
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:58,300
Oh, my God.

1070
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:02,200
Let's back out real slow.

1071
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,200
Myers, ready your grenades.

1072
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,200
Marco. Marco. Marco.

1073
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:27,900
Get your big, red butt over here.

1074
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,100
I'm coming for you, kid!

1075
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,800
No piggybacks!

1076
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,400
Get off me, you...

1077
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:44,700
Liz, no!

1078
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:47,700
They're gonna kill him!
Do something!

1079
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,200
What do you want me to do?

1080
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,300
- Hit me.
- What?

1081
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,400
Hit me.

1082
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,200
Now!

1083
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,700
You should be running.

1084
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:15,800
They are all here.

1085
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:17,600
All of them.

1086
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,800
Just the way it was promised.

1087
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,800
This one's awake.

1088
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,000
Thank you for this.

1089
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,500
"And I looked...

1090
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,000
...and beheld an angel.

1091
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:19,400
And in his right hand,
the key to the bottomless pit. "

1092
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:26,600
These were the words I heard
as a peasant boy in Tobolsk.

1093
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,800
And now, the door.

1094
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,400
Sent by the Ogdru Jahad...

1095
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:37,100
...so that they might at long last
enter our world.

1096
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:41,100
You are the key,
the right hand of doom.

1097
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,400
Your stone hand.

1098
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,000
What did you think it was made for?

1099
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:49,200
Open the locks.

1100
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:50,900
Don't do it, Red! Don't do it!

1101
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,800
Silence.

1102
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,900
Imagine it.

1103
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,100
An Eden...

1104
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,700
...for you and her.

1105
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:05,400
No.

1106
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,300
No?

1107
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,200
In exchange for her soul, then?

1108
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:18,400
Open the door.

1109
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,600
No.

1110
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:24,600
As you wish.

1111
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,900
No!

1112
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,600
Liz!

1113
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:58,900
Her soul awaits on the other side.

1114
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:01,100
If you want her back...

1115
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:03,800
...open the door and claim her.

1116
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:12,300
Your true name is inscribed
around the locks that hold you.

1117
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:13,800
You cannot break them...

1118
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:16,400
...no matter how strong you are.

1119
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,400
The eclipse has begun.

1120
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,300
Your true name...

1121
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:26,000
...say it!

1122
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,600
Become the key.

1123
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:44,300
For her.

1124
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:48,600
Anung un Rama.

1125
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,200
Repeat it.

1126
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,900
Anung un Rama.

1127
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,500
Open the final lock.

1128
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:17,800
Remember who you are!

1129
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:40,400
Believe me, I have lived
long enough to know...

1130
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:42,800
...not a tear will be shed
for this world!

1131
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,400
You have a choice.

1132
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:47,100
Your father gave you that.

1133
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,400
No, you don't!

1134
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:49,900
Open it!

1135
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:53,900
Do it!

1136
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,800
What have you done?

1137
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,400
I chose.

1138
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:37,600
You will never fulfill your destiny.

1139
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:41,600
You will never understand
the power inside you.

1140
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:44,500
I'll just have to find a way
to live with that.

1141
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:56,900
Child.

1142
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:58,700
Look what you've done.

1143
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,500
You've killed me...

1144
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:03,900
...an insignificant man.

1145
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,200
But you have brought forth...

1146
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:08,900
...a god.

1147
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,800
Myers, let's go.

1148
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,700
Hell will hold no surprises for us.

1149
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:54,700
I took a grenade belt.

1150
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,400
The damn thing's broken.

1151
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:05,200
Keep her safe, will you?

1152
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:07,800
Whatever happens,
don't leave her alone.

1153
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:09,300
I won't.

1154
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,900
You're okay, Myers.

1155
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:21,000
Stick around.

1156
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:23,400
Hey, Red.

1157
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:28,100
Just pull the cable.

1158
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:29,500
I didn't get you anything.

1159
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:34,400
Are you going to be okay alone?

1160
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:39,000
How big can it be?

1161
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,500
Damn!

1162
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:05,400
Damn.

1163
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:54,300
Oh, this is gonna hurt.

1164
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,900
Gonna be sore in the morning.

1165
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,600
She's got no pulse.

1166
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,300
She's not breathing.

1167
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:00,100
Liz?

1168
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,700
I was so foolish.

1169
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:34,600
Red.

1170
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,100
In the dark...

1171
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,600
...I heard your voice.

1172
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,000
What did you say?

1173
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:58,400
I said, "Hey...

1174
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:01,500
...you on the other side...

1175
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:04,800
...let her go.

1176
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:08,100
Because for...

1177
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,900
For her I'll cross over.

1178
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:22,800
And then you'll be sorry. "

1179
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:45,000
<i>What makes a man a man?</i>

1180
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:47,800
<i>A friend of mine once wondered.</i>

1181
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:52,400
<i>Is it his origins?
The way he comes to life?</i>

1182
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:54,500
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1183
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:56,500
<i>It's the choices he makes.</i>

1184
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:58,900
<i>Not how he starts things...</i>

1185
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,200
<i>...but how he decides to end them.</i>
