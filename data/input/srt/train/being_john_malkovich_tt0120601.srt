1
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,570
Craig, honey,
it's time for bed.

2
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,326
Craig, honey, time to get up.

3
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,079
Craig, honey, time to get up.
Craig, honey, time to get up.

4
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,081
- Craig, honey, time to get up.
- Lotte.

5
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,335
I'm sorry. I didn't know
Orrin Hatch was out of his cage.

6
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,003
Come on. Morning, sweetheart.

7
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,713
Morning.

8
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,590
What are you gonna do today?

9
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,508
Working in the workshop.

10
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:56,843
I was thinking.

11
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,554
Maybe you'd feel better
if you got a job.

12
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,847
We've been over this.

13
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:05,101
Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in
today's wintry economic climate.

14
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:09,105
I know, honey,
but I thought, you know,

15
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:14,027
maybe something else until this
puppet thing turns around.

16
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,029
Derek Mantini
doesn't need a day job.

17
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,783
Not everybody can be
Derek Mantini.

18
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,329
I gotta get to the shop.
We have a shipment of kitty litter coming in.

19
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,332
Will you do me a favor?
Will you take a look at Elijah today?

20
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,376
He's not feeling
very good again.

21
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,503
Which one is Elijah again?

22
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,631
- The chimp, honey.
- Yeah, okay.

23
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,137
On the lighter
side of the news,

24
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,391
in Westchester County today
puppeteer Derek Mantini

25
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,435
thrilled onlookers as he
performed The Belle of Amherst

26
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,146
with a 60-foot
Emily Dickinson puppet.

27
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,401
How dreary to be somebody!

28
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,528
How public, like a frog

29
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,906
To tell one's
name the livelong day

30
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,825
Gimmicky bastard.

31
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,997
You don't know lucky you are,
being a monkey.

32
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,625
Because consciousness...

33
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,462
is a terrible curse.

34
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:18,133
I think, I feel, I suffer.

35
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,472
And all I ask in return is the
opportunity to do my work.

36
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,768
And they won't allow it...

37
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,772
Because I raise issues.

38
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,368
While we enjoy the
pleasures of an uneasy love

39
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,037
and abandon ourselves
to fornication,

40
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,291
we were spared God's severity.

41
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,293
Say no more, I beg you,

42
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,128
and cease
from complaints like these

43
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,339
which are so far removed
from the true depths of love.

44
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,427
Look, a puppet show!

45
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,181
Okay, honey, just for a minute.
Mommy's waiting.

46
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,808
Even during
the celebration of Mass,

47
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,060
when our prayers
should be pure,

48
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,687
lewd visions of these pleasures

49
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,524
take such a hold
upon my unhappy soul

50
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:21,446
that my thoughts are on their very
wantonness instead of my prayers.

51
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:31,581
Sometimes my thoughts are betrayed
by the movement of my body.

52
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,668
I took my fill of my
wretched pleasures in you

53
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,755
and this was
the sum total of my love.

54
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,288
You motherfucker!

55
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,131
Oh, Craig!

56
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,093
Honey, not again!

57
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,513
Why do you do this
to yourself, honey?

58
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,807
I'm a puppeteer.

59
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,442
Seven and a half, right?

60
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,610
Uh, yeah.

61
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,820
I'll take you through it.

62
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,174
Seven and a half.

63
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,343
Thank you.

64
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:06,045
Welcome to Lestercorp.
How may we meet your filing needs?

65
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,673
No. Um...
My name's Craig Schwartz.

66
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,383
I have an interview
with Dr. Lester.

67
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,720
Oh. Please have a seat,
Mr. Juarez.

68
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,054
Schwartz.

69
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,931
- Pardon?
- Schwartz.

70
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:21,269
I...I'm sorry. I have no idea what
you're saying to me right now.

71
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,354
My name is Schwartz.

72
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,148
My name is Warts?

73
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,242
Mr. Juarez?

74
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,162
- Oh. Yes?
- Chest?

75
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:40,830
I said, "Yes?"

76
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,665
You suggest what?

77
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,628
I'm sorry, I have no time for piddling
suggestions from mumbling job applicants.

78
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,339
Besides,
Dr. Lester will see you now.

79
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,178
Come in, Mr. Juarez.

80
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,557
Actually, my name
is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.

81
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,852
- Security!
- No, sir, it's...

82
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,772
It's just a little mix-up with your secretary.
My name is Craig Schwartz.

83
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,523
I tried to explain that to her.

84
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,567
She's not my secretary.

85
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,528
- She's what they call an executive liaison.
- Ah.

86
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,406
And I am not banging her, if
that's what you're implying.

87
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:19,035
No, sir, not at all.
I think I must have simply misspoke.

88
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,086
Ah. Well, now,

89
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,217
tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you
feel you can bring to Lestercorp?

90
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,720
Uh, well, sir,
I'm an excellent filer.

91
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,723
Are you? All right.
Let's see about that.

92
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:50,775
Tell me, which of these two letters comes first?
This one or this one?

93
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,156
The symbol on the left
is not a letter, sir.

94
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,158
Damn, you're good.

95
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,619
- I was trying to trick you.
- I see.

96
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,789
Well, then, put these in order.

97
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,083
Yes, sir.

98
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,090
Floris,
get Guinness on the phone.

99
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,176
- Yes, sir.
- Genghis Khan Capone. Fine.

100
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,386
Damn fine woman, Floris.

101
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,473
I don't know how she puts up with
this speech impediment of mine.

102
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,228
You don't have a speech
impediment, Dr. Lester.

103
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,231
Flattery will get you
everywhere, my boy.

104
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,609
I'm afraid I have to trust
Floris on that one.

105
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,695
You see,
she's got her doctorate

106
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,698
in speech impedimentology
from Case Western.

107
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,325
I apologize if you can't
understand a word I'm saying.

108
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,619
No, I understand perfectly.

109
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,455
Oh, it's very kind of you
to lie.

110
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,416
You see, I've been very lonely

111
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,295
in my isolated tower
of indecipherable speech.

112
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,136
You got the job.

113
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,054
Any questions?

114
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,764
Well, just one.

115
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,350
Why are these ceilings so low?

116
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,727
Low overhead, my boy!

117
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,313
We pass the savings on to you.

118
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:14,233
But seriously, that'll all
be covered in orientation.

119
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,891
Welcome to the seven and a half
floor of the Mertin Flemmer Building.

120
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,101
As you'll now be spending
your work day here,

121
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:53,230
it is important that you learn a bit
about the history of this famous floor.

122
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,316
Hello, Don. Hello, Wendy.

123
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,901
Don, I was wondering,

124
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,154
do you know why our workplace
has such low ceilings?

125
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,073
It's an interesting story.

126
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,200
Many years ago
in the late 1800s,

127
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,994
James Mertin,
an Irish ship captain,

128
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,665
came to this town and decided
to erect an office building.

129
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:14,335
He called this building the Mertin
Flemmer Building after himself

130
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,546
and someone else, who local
legend has it was named Flemmer.

131
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:21,092
Well, one day, old Captain Mertin
received an unexpected visitor.

132
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,593
Captain Mertin?

133
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,845
Aye. What want ye, girl child?

134
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,058
I'm not a child, but rather an adult
lady of miniature proportions.

135
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,520
I see. Well, if it's
charity you're after,

136
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,231
be gone with ye,
you foul demon!

137
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,233
I'm not asking for alms

138
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,403
but, rather, the ear of a
kind man with a noble heart.

139
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,155
Well, speak then, if you must.

140
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,865
Captain Mertin, I'm afraid that

141
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,118
the world was not built
with me in mind.

142
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,037
Doorknobs are too high,
chairs are unwieldy

143
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,957
and high-ceilinged rooms
mock my stature.

144
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,086
Why cannot there be a place for me
to work that's safe and comfortable?

145
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,755
Thy story has moved me
like no other.

146
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,091
Therefore, I shall make ye...

147
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,468
me wife.

148
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,179
And... And I shall build
a floor for ye

149
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,891
between the seventh and the
eighth in me own building

150
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,729
so at least there'll be
one place on God's green earth

151
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,232
where ye and your accursed
kind can live in peace.

152
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,903
So that's the story
of seven and a half.

153
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,864
Since the rents
are considerably lower,

154
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,199
this floor has been adopted
by businesses which,

155
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,994
for one reason or another, have
been forced to cut corners.

156
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,663
After all, the overhead is low.

157
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,760
Moving story, huh?

158
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,638
Unfortunately,
the story's bullshit.

159
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,729
Listen, I'm Craig Schwartz.
I'm just starting out at Lestercorp.

160
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,981
Where are you starting out?

161
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,571
Shut up! Shut up!

162
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:06,906
Shut up! Shut up!

163
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,157
Hey, shut up!

164
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,577
- Shut up! I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, honey.

165
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,830
Sorry, honey. Sorry, honey.

166
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,334
- Shut up!
- Sorry!

167
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,919
Help!
She's locking me in a cage.

168
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,004
Isn't that cute?
I just taught him that today.

169
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,923
Yeah, that's adorable.

170
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:29,345
- You want to do some dishes for me?
- Put that down.

171
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,680
Here, Elijah. Here you go.

172
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,975
You know, I have an appointment
tomorrow with Elijah's shrink.

173
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,102
Uh-huh.

174
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,895
Yeah. I think we're
finally getting down

175
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,314
to the bottom of this
acid stomach, aren't we?

176
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,941
Come here.

177
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,195
Just get down from the...

178
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,615
She thinks that it's
some sort of childhood trauma.

179
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,454
- Feelings of inadequacy as a
chimp, you know? - Mmm-hmm.

180
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,457
Careful.
Isn't that interesting?

181
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,875
Mmm-hmm.

182
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,628
I find it really interesting.

183
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:11,053
So, honey, have you thought any
more about us having a baby?

184
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,973
Uh...

185
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,476
You know, I think it's just so tough
right now, economically and all...

186
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,145
Mmm-hmm.

187
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,732
...that I think maybe we should just
wait and see if this job thing pays off.

188
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,902
- You know?
- Okay.

189
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,619
I was thinking about
what you were saying

190
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,830
about the orientation film
being bullshit.

191
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,081
Yes?

192
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,333
I think maybe
you're on to something.

193
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,627
And 50 other lines
to get into a girl's pants.

194
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,671
No, no!

195
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,508
No, I was just talking about the...
You know, about the film.

196
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,302
Here's the thing.

197
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,013
If you ever got me,

198
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,766
you wouldn't have a clue
what to do with me.

199
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,856
I wasn't...
I was talking about the film.

200
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:13,407
Ooh, what magic those fingers could
work on the right cabinet, mmm.

201
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,118
Maybe you could alphabetize me.

202
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,037
And don't forget,

203
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,457
"I" comes before "U."

204
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,212
Floris,
I think you're very nice,

205
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:30,758
but the truth is that
I'm in love with someone else.

206
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,845
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're saying to me.

207
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,847
You bastard.

208
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,140
What?

209
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,602
- Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.
- Oh, no...

210
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,605
If I was 80 years younger,
I'd box your ears.

211
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,733
I wasn't toying with her, sir.
I wouldn't...

212
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,443
Pardon me.
How old are you, sir?

213
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,487
One hundred and five.

214
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,323
Carrot juice, and lots of it.

215
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,077
I swear, sometimes it's not worth it.
I piss orange.

216
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:02,498
And I have to piss sitting down
like a goddamn girly-girl,

217
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,291
- every 15 minutes.
- Mmm.

218
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,418
But nobody wants to die.

219
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,964
Ah, to be a young man again,
eh, Schwartz?

220
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,259
Maybe then
Floris would care for me.

221
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:18,013
But the elderly have so much to offer, sir.
They're our link with history.

222
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,641
I don't wanna be
your goddamn link, damn ya.

223
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,228
I want to feel Florie's
naked thighs next to mine.

224
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:29,483
I want my body to inspire lust in
that beautiful, complex woman.

225
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:35,155
I want her to shiver with a spasm of ecstasy,
Schwartz, as I penetrate her wet...

226
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,993
Dr. Lester, while I'm flattered you
would share your feelings with me,

227
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,997
perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable
environment for this type of discussion.

228
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,456
All right. You're right.

229
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:49,295
I'll tell you what. Meet me after work
today at Jerry's Juiceteria on Lex

230
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,298
and I'll spill
my goddamn guts for ya.

231
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,053
No, I won't be late, Lotte.
I just have to, you know,

232
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,598
listen to Lester's sexual fantasies
and drink carrot juice for a while.

233
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,809
It's a job thing, really.

234
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,023
Yeah. So,
I'll talk to you later, okay?

235
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,482
Yeah. You too.

236
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,193
Gotta go back to work.
Okay, bye.

237
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:19,241
Hi. Do you know that I don't even
know your name or where you work?

238
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,659
Yeah.

239
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,456
Um, okay, how about this?

240
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,624
If I can guess your name
in three tries,

241
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,794
you have to come
have a drink with me tonight.

242
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,339
Why not?

243
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,050
Okay.

244
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,177
You look like a...

245
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,223
Bar...

246
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,060
Ru...

247
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,898
Bell... Lu...

248
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,734
L... Carol...

249
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,612
Ta... Shar...

250
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,906
Susann...

251
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:03,118
Emm...ily...

252
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,871
Mar...lar...

253
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,291
Maax...ine... M-M-M-Maxine?

254
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,835
Yeah! Who told you?

255
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,588
Nobody told me.
That just came out.

256
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,757
Isn't that odd?

257
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,344
So where do you live and stuff?

258
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,764
I am dubious,
but I don't welsh.

259
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,309
Okay, meet me
at The Stuck Pig, 7:00.

260
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,521
If you're late, I walk.

261
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,940
Nubile. Blonde.

262
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,691
Wet with desire.

263
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,361
Me in leather.
A harness, if you like.

264
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,823
And all eyes, Craig,
are upon me as I speak.

265
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:45,327
"Ladies," I begin.
"I am the love god Eros."

266
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,121
They like that.

267
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,081
"I intoxicate you.

268
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,209
"My spunk is, to you,
manna from heaven."

269
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,462
Dr. Lester, this is all
really fascinating and stuff,

270
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,465
but I gotta
get back home to my wife.

271
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,551
You have a wife.
I'd like to meet her.

272
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,429
- Yes, sir.
- Shall we say dinner Thursday?

273
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,265
You can come, too, if you like.

274
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,933
Get that? That was a joke.

275
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,726
You hear what I said?
You can come too.

276
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,478
That was a good one.

277
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,897
- All right. Thank you.
- Yeah.

278
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,200
Maxine. Maxine.

279
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,453
- I made it, Maxine.
- Just.

280
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,746
Buy you a drink, Maxine?

281
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,457
Are you married?

282
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,169
Yeah. But enough about me.

283
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,378
Yeah.

284
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,298
What'll you have?

285
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,300
I'll have more of the same,
please, Barry.

286
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,136
And I'll have, uh,
a light beer or something.

287
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,596
Hi.

288
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,309
So, uh...

289
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,562
I don't know... I, uh...

290
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,815
I like you. I don't know what
it is about you. I just...

291
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,984
- My tits?
- No! No, no, no, no.

292
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,696
- No? - It's your energy, attitude,
the way you carry yourself.

293
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,947
You're not a fag, are you?

294
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,325
No. I am
really attracted to you.

295
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,994
"I am really attracted to you."
Christ, you are a fag.

296
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,163
Well, we can share recipes
if you like, Darlene.

297
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,166
No, wait! I love your tits.
I wanna fuck 'em.

298
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,376
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

299
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,837
Not a chance.

300
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,299
So tell me about yourself, huh?

301
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,762
If you can get your mind out of
the gutter long enough, dog boy.

302
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,223
Well, I'm a puppeteer.

303
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,016
- I...I've been...
- Check.

304
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:37,981
Hey.

305
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:39,816
Hey.

306
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,402
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I just...

307
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,197
Lester just wouldn't
let me get away.

308
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,492
Hi, Elijah. We're supposed to
have dinner with him on Thursday

309
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,869
but I can get us out of it,
if you want.

310
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,455
He's like this insane old lech,

311
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,709
and it's kind of amusing once you get
past how disgusting it actually is.

312
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,379
- Did you eat?
- No. I'm not hungry.

313
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,881
I'm sorry I didn't call.
It was just hard to get away.

314
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,383
I was worried.

315
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,884
I'm sorry.

316
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,346
You know...

317
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,809
you wanted me to work.

318
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,397
How was your evening?

319
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:19,856
Well...

320
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,151
Tom-Tom's puncture wound
is infected.

321
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,695
The ferret?

322
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,863
- The iguana.
- Right.

323
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,535
So I just dressed the wound and
I've just been feeding everyone

324
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,996
and putting everybody to bed.

325
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,248
You want a beer?

326
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,750
No. I think
I'm going to go to bed.

327
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,420
Elijah's gonna
sleep with us tonight.

328
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,088
I don't think
he's feeling very well.

329
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,215
- Okay. Hmm.
- Yeah.

330
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:50,762
Well, you know what? I'm gonna go
in my workshop for a little while.

331
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,306
But I'll be in
in a little while.

332
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,682
Okay.

333
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,353
Tell me, Craig,
why do you love puppeteering?

334
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:45,817
Well, Maxine,
I'm not sure exactly.

335
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:49,404
Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
someone else for a little while.

336
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,698
Being inside another skin,

337
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:55,035
thinking differently,
moving differently,

338
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,496
feeling differently.

339
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,082
Interesting, Craig.

340
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,418
Would you like
to be inside my skin,

341
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,547
think what I think,
feel what I feel?

342
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,011
More than anything, Maxine.

343
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,059
It's good in here, Craig.

344
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,437
It's better than
your wildest dreams.

345
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,051
You're not somebody I could
get interested in, Craig.

346
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,928
You play with dolls.

347
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:59,933
Puppets, Maxine. It's the idea of
being inside someone else's skin

348
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,770
and seeing what they see
and feeling what they feel.

349
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:05,313
Yikes!

350
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,816
It's just that, well...
Please let me explain.

351
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,485
I've never
done this before, but...

352
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,738
I feel something for you,

353
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:15,240
and I've never
felt this way before.

354
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,368
You know, about anybody,
n-not even my wife.

355
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,912
And I just...

356
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:24,458
I really feel that you and I
belong together, Maxine.

357
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,168
Oh!

358
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,694
Shit.

359
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:18,071
- See you later.
- Hello. Mail room.

360
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,910
Yeah. Yeah.
What's the file number?

361
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,164
3-2-3-6-4. Yep.

362
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:10,999
Oh!

363
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:30,412
Oh, you know what?
The puppeteer told me he loved me today.

364
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,748
I know, I can't think
of anything more pathetic.

365
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,292
I'm sorry.

366
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,422
Good afternoon, sir.

367
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,601
The Broadhurst Theater, please.

368
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,446
Hey, say, uh,
ain't you that actor guy?

369
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,947
Yes.

370
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,617
John, uh... What is, uh...
John, um, uh...

371
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,912
Uh, don't tell me. Maplethorpe?

372
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:16,458
- Malkovich.
- Malkovich. Right, right. Okay.

373
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,170
Yeah. I thought you were
all right in that one movie.

374
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,546
Thank you.

375
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,049
The one where you played
a jewel thief.

376
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,384
I never played a jewel thief.

377
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,803
No? Who am I thinkin' of?

378
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,847
I don't know.

379
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,724
Just, uh...

380
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:37,687
No, no, I'm pretty sure it was you.
The, uh... 'Cause, uh...

381
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,310
Yeah. Absolutely, doll.

382
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,730
Yeah.
I'm just about to close up.

383
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,776
Wanna meet at the Pig
in 20 minutes? Cool. Bye.

384
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,738
I'm splitting' for the day,
puppet man.

385
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:29,823
Lock up for me, okay?

386
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,325
Don't you wanna know
what happened to me?

387
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,744
- No.
- Please, this is important.

388
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,788
Better be.

389
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,206
It is.

390
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,714
There's a tiny door
in my office, Maxine.

391
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,969
It's a portal, and it takes
you inside John Malkovich.

392
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,097
You see the world
through John Malkovich's eyes

393
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,808
and then after about 15
minutes, you're spit out

394
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,769
into a ditch on the side
of the New Jersey Turnpike.

395
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:02,897
Sounds great!
Who the fuck is John Malkovich?

396
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,943
Oh, he's an actor. He's one of the great
American actors of the 20th century.

397
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:09,112
Oh, yeah? What's he been in?

398
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,656
Lots of things.
That jewel thief movie, for example.

399
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,909
He's very well respected.
Anyway, the point is

400
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:20,039
this is a very odd thing.
It's supernatural,

401
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,042
for lack of a better word.
I mean, it raises

402
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,879
all sorts of philosophical-type
questions, you know...

403
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:29,507
about the nature of self,
about the existence of a soul.

404
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:32,385
You know, am I me?
Is Malkovich Malkovich?

405
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:37,432
I had a piece of wood in my hand.
I don't have it anymore.

406
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,518
Where is it? Did it disappear?

407
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,855
How could that be?
Is it still in Malkovich's head?

408
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,857
I don't know!

409
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:51,446
Do you see what a metaphysical
can of worms this portal is?

410
00:33:55,451 --> 00:34:00,079
I don't see how I could go on living
my life the way I've lived it before.

411
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,598
- Yeah?
- So I've been thinking,

412
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,391
is this Malkovich fellow
appealing?

413
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:23,645
Maxine! Yes, of course,
Maxine. He's a celebrity.

414
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,272
Good. We'll sell tickets.

415
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,858
Tickets to Malkovich?

416
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:31,402
Exactly. $200 a pop.

417
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,575
But, Maxine, there's something, I
don't know, like profound here.

418
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,037
I don't know if maybe we
should exploit it. You think?

419
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,416
I need you for this, Craigy.
You're my man on the inside.

420
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,001
You need me?

421
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,087
I'm your man?

422
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,881
Sure, whatever.

423
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,468
Hey, everybody, I'm home.

424
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,595
Treats for everyone.

425
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,347
- Maxine?
- Yeah?

426
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,101
We don't know the significance
of this thing.

427
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,687
It might be dangerous
to toy with?

428
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,524
Well,
I'll protect you, doll face.

429
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,693
Bye-bye.

430
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,198
Who was that?

431
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,953
I'm going to be working a lot of
late nights with this partner

432
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,997
because Lestercorp's open
during the day,

433
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,915
so I'll be working
a lot of late nights.

434
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,335
But it's a good thing, 'cause it's gonna
get us out of the hole financially

435
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,712
'cause we're gonna
turn it into a business.

436
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:34,048
But I don't understand.
There's not...

437
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:38,636
There's no such thing as a hole, or
a portal, into somebody's brain.

438
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:42,974
Yes, there is.
A brain, or soul or whatever.

439
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,768
I was inside John Malkovich
lookin' out.

440
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,271
- Really?
- Yep.

441
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,814
I wanna try it.

442
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:50,940
Pardon me?

443
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:54,027
I want to be
John Malkovich, tomorrow.

444
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:56,446
That'd be perfect, 'cause then
I can meet your partner.

445
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,574
The thing is, Lestercorp's
open during the day,

446
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:04,203
so we can't go during the day.
But if you want to, we can do it right now.

447
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,164
- Now? Right now?
- Tonight.

448
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,750
Right now,
on the way to Lester's.

449
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:24,057
I'll meet you on the side of the
road by the New Jersey Turnpike.

450
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,105
I'm scared.

451
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,151
You don't have to do this,
you know.

452
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:40,740
No. No, I...I wanna go.

453
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:44,035
- You sure? Okay.
- Yeah.

454
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,807
It's wet.

455
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,060
Weird.

456
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,945
That's nice. Oh!

457
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:23,324
Oh, mmm!

458
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,952
Oh! Mmm.

459
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,997
God. I feel sexy.

460
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,174
Lotte, are you all right?

461
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,974
Craig! Craig, I gotta go back!
No!

462
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:51,811
- Maybe tomorrow.
- No! I gotta go back now!

463
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,105
We'll talk about it later.

464
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,527
Being inside
did something to me.

465
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,863
I knew who I was.

466
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:10,663
It's like everything made sense.
I...I knew who I was.

467
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,458
But you weren't you.
You were John Malkovich.

468
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,627
God, I was. I was, wasn't I?

469
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,047
I was...

470
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:23,050
I was John Malkovich.

471
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:28,681
I was... I was
John fucking Malkovich!

472
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:33,728
Take me back, Craig.

473
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,730
We're late for Lester.

474
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,863
So tell me, Lotte, can you
understand a word I'm saying?

475
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,699
Oh, yes, Dr. Lester.
Absolutely.

476
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:50,328
You were just explaining
the nutritional value

477
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,832
of ingesting minerals through a colloidal
form which I couldn't agree more with.

478
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:57,084
Oh! Be still, my heart.

479
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:04,884
Dr. Lester, would you mind pointing
me in the direction of the restroom?

480
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:09,430
With the greatest pleasure, my dear.
You go up the grand escalier

481
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,726
and once atop the stairs you'll
want to enter the, uh...

482
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,688
fifth door on my left.
Watch the step down. It's sunken.

483
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,607
Okay. Thank you.

"Malkovich
Physical Development."

485
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:37,685
What do you think Lester's
relationship with John Malkovich is?

486
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:43,941
That portal's been boarded up forever.
I bet Lester's not even aware of it.

487
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:46,485
Him, the portal. Why?

488
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,988
No reason. I was just thinking.

489
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,658
Do you think that it's kind of weird
that John Malkovich has a portal?

490
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:56,329
Do you think that it might have some
sort of significance, for example?

491
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,998
I don't know.
Why do you think that?

492
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,583
I don't even care.

493
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:04,503
I think it's kind of sexy that
John Malkovich has a portal.

494
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,298
Sort of like
it's like he's a vagina.

495
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,592
It's sort of vaginal,
like he has a...

496
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,094
he has a penis and a vagina.

497
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:17,141
It's sort of like
Malkovich's feminine side.

498
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,770
I like that.

Oblique but intriguing.

00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,749
Hi. I heard your voice.

506
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:44,168
What are you doing here?

507
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,505
Is this your partner?
She's pretty.

508
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,926
I had to do the Malkovich ride
again, you know? Is this her?

00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,928
- Hi. You're Craig's wife?
- Yeah. Hi.

Have you done Malkovich yet?

Yeah, I want to place an ad.

Okay. "Ever want to be
someone else?"

514
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,358
No, that's the ad, but we can
talk about you in a minute.

518
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:25,418
I've been going over and over my
experience last night, Craig.

519
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,796
It was amazing.

520
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:34,844
I've decided
that I'm a transsexual.

521
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,221
I know it's
the craziest thing, Craig!

522
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,389
What, are you fuckin' nuts?

523
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:42,560
No. It's just that for the first
time, everything just felt right.

524
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,980
I've got to make sure.

525
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,150
But if the feeling
is still there,

526
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:55,072
I'm going to talk to Dr.
Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.

527
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:57,742
This is absurd!
Besides, Feldman is an allergist.

528
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:59,160
If you're going to
do something, do it right.

529
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,953
We talked about this
a million times.

530
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,706
You get these half-assed ideas,
and then you do a half-assed job.

531
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,790
Just drop it.

532
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,751
It's just that I really,
you know,

533
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,586
like Dr. Feldman. All right?

534
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,338
So I thought that
I would ask him his opinion.

535
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,008
Is there something
so terrible about that?

536
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,634
Why do you always
yell at me like this?

537
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,511
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

538
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:22,057
It's just a phase. It's the thrill of
seeing through somebody else's eyes.

539
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:23,768
Okay? It'll pass.

540
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,438
Don't stand in the way
of my actualization as a man.

541
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,900
Let her go, Craig.

542
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:32,735
- Okay.
- I mean him.

543
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,529
Right now?

544
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,491
Uh-huh.

545
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,495
It's the middle of the day.
How am I going to get her past Lester?

546
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:43,913
Yawn. Figure it out.

547
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,165
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

548
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,542
- Bye.
- Bye.

549
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,388
Davey, it's Max.

550
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:05,392

- of mysterious anticipation.

00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,806
Yeah?

561
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,308
- Mr. John Malkovich?
- Yeah. Who's calling?

562
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,352
Oh, my goodness!

563
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,813
You don't know me,
but I know you.

564
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:53,065
I'm a great admirer of yours.

565
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,734
How did you get this number?

566
00:44:56,278 --> 00:45:00,865
Well... it's just that I...
I... I dream about you.

567
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:05,369
And well, even speaking to you now has
gotten me sort of excited, you know?

568
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,664
Wow, the way
this woman's talking to him.

569
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,792
Listen, I really don't
find this amusing.

570
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,752
Don't call here anymore, okay?

571
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:17,339
Well! My nipples are at attention,
General Malkovich, sir.

572
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:20,050
What, her nipples?

573
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:22,803
So, listen, why don't we
have dinner tonight?

574
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:26,891
Bernardo's? 8:00?
I really want to see you.

575
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:30,144
I just loved you
in that jewel thief movie.

576
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,233
You're not gonna
meet her there?

577
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,776
Come on!

578
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:41,155
Meet her. Meet her there.
Meet her there! Meet her there!

579
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:46,118
I am sick,
anxious, poor as a beggar.

580
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,413
Meet her there! Meet her there!
Meet her there!

581
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,832
Meet her there! Meet her there!
Meet her there!

582
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,918
Everywhere.

583
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:55,586
But wherever I have been,

584
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,379
every minute, day and night...

585
00:45:57,464 --> 00:46:00,174
Meet her there. Meet her there.
Meet her there.

586
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,425
Yes!

587
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,350
How was it?

588
00:46:09,643 --> 00:46:12,561
I have to go back
at 8:00 exactly, tonight.

589
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,272
Why?

590
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:16,774
Don't crowd me, Craig.

591
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:28,786
Excuse me.
Are you John Malkovich?

592
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:29,954
Yes, I am.

593
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:34,625
Wow. You really are great in that
movie where you play that retard.

594
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,669
Oh, thank you very much.

595
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,295
I have a cousin who's a retard.

596
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,421
Oh. Thank you.

597
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,340
So, as you might imagine,

598
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,260
it means a lot to me
to see retards

599
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:49,181
portrayed on the silver
screen so compassionately.

600
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:52,101
Well, thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

601
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,061
Good night.

602
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:57,731
Maxine?

603
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:00,693
- It's Maxine.
- Hi.

604
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,861
I'm so glad
you decided to come.

605
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,238
I'm Maxine.

606
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,323
I'm John. How do you do?

607
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:08,492
Good.

608
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:13,914
I wasn't sure
I was going to come...

609
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:16,750
but I felt, uh,
oddly compelled.

610
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,755
You're so beautiful.
The way you're looking at me...

611
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,591
I mean, at him... At us.

612
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:32,433
I've never been looked at
like this by a woman before.

613
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:34,852
I think I'm sweating.

614
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,479
I must say, I was
intrigued by your voice.

615
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:42,693
And the funny thing is, Mr.
Malkovich, my voice is probably

616
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,528
the least intriguing thing
about me.

617
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,910
So, I mean...

618
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:54,455
So, how was it?
What was he doing?

619
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,206
He wasn't doing anything
really.

620
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,375
He was just
hanging around his apartment.

621
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,755
I think he's probably just
a really, uh, lonely guy.

622
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:05,716
See, men can feel
unfulfilled, too, Lotte.

623
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,551
I'm glad you're coming
to realize that.

624
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,928
You shouldn't be so quick to
assume that switching bodies

625
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:12,973
is gonna be the answer
to your problems.

626
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,477
You're right, Craig.
You're right.

627
00:48:19,022 --> 00:48:21,690
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that maybe

628
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:24,568
we should invite Maxine
over for dinner one night

629
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,738
because you guys are partners and I thought
that might be a really nice gesture.

630
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,156
I think she'd like that.

631
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,824
- Maxine?
- What?

632
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:34,787
The thing is, there's been some
tension between us at work,

633
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:36,163
business stuff,

634
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,748
and I would hate to
expose you to that.

635
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,000
It'll be okay.

636
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,794
I'll cook my lasagna,

637
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:44,088
we'll smoke a joint,

638
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,508
and tensions
will just melt away.

639
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:52,846
Now, when you say that I can be somebody
else, what do you mean exactly?

640
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,849
Well, we mean exactly that.

641
00:48:56,851 --> 00:49:00,854
We can put you inside someone
else's body for 15 minutes.

642
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:04,191
Can I be anybody
that I wanna be?

643
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:08,695
Well... You... Actually...

644
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,864
You can be John Malkovich.

645
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,533
That's perfect!

646
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:16,245
It's my second choice,
but it's wonderful. It's...

647
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,500
I'm a fat man.

648
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:24,419
- I am sad and fat...
- $200?

649
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,881
Oh. Oh, uh, yes.

650
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,268
- Okay.
- You gotta crawl in there.

651
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:41,061
Oh, my God.

652
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,455
No, that's what I'm saying.

653
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,333
See, I don't really need
an extra bathmat.

654
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:06,253
So if I get the set,
would it be possible

655
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:11,133
if I could just get maybe
three extra hand towels...

656
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,928
Uh, if I get the set
instead of the bathmat?

657
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,014
- Yes, sir.
- Sure, we can do that.

658
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,515
Great. That sounds good.

659
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,352
And for the color, periwinkle?

660
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:25,022
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're out of stock in periwinkle.

661
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,274
Do you want to back order?

662
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:31,570
No. I'll, uh,
go with the loden.

663
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,864
Would you like to order
anything else?

664
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:39,745
What is the difference between the
foot-pampering looped cotton rug

665
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,497
and the bathmat?

666
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:00,015
You're my friends. Thank you.

667
00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:03,936
Did you know that
Eskimos have not one,

668
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:09,024
but, 49 words for snow?

669
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,360
Mmm.

670
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:14,112
It's because
they have so much of it.

671
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,826
So much snow.

672
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:23,997
After dinner,
I'll show you my puppets.

673
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:25,082
Ah.

674
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:28,502
After dinner, I'll introduce
you to my chimp Elijah.

675
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:34,132
He has an ulcer right now due
to suppressed childhood trauma.

676
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:35,968
But we're working through it.

677
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,223
Psychotherapy.

678
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:42,391
Oh.

679
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:03,328
This the bedroom?

680
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,414
Yeah.

681
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,918
The thing is,
the way that I see it,

682
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:12,921
is, I think
the world is divided

683
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:15,299
into those
who go after what they want

684
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:18,302
- and then those who don't, right?
- Right.

685
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:21,972
The passionate ones, the ones
who go after what they want,

686
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:25,142
well, they may not get
what they want.

687
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:31,148
But, at least
they remain vital.

688
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:32,733
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

689
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:37,946
So when they lie on their death
beds, they have, um, few regrets.

690
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,906
Right?

691
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,998
And the ones who don't
go after what they want,

692
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:51,585
well, who gives a shit
about them, anyway?

693
00:52:54,756 --> 00:52:57,090
- God! Craig!
- Lotte!

694
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:01,970
I don't find you attractive,
hmm? And, Lotte,

695
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,307
I'm smitten with you.

696
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,101
I am, but only
when you're in Malkovich.

697
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:11,229
When I looked into his eyes last
night, I could feel you peering out.

698
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:12,939
- Really?
- Yeah.

699
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,525
Behind the stubble
and the too prominent brow

700
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,778
and the male-pattern baldness,

701
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:20,238
I sensed your feminine longing.

702
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:23,992
And it just slew me.

703
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:25,577
Oh, my God!

704
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,746
Oh!

705
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,123
Only as John, sweetie.

706
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,084
Sorry.

707
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,296
Hey, thanks for
a wonderful dinner.

708
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,716
No hard feelings, partner?

709
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,736
- J.M. Inc.
- Hi. It's Lotte.

710
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,989
I'd like very much
to see you again.

711
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:06,451
Can you call him
and invite yourself over?

712
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:08,829
Um, when?

713
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:14,793
Mmm, tonight, after you close?

714
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:18,463
Okay, uh, 4:11.

715
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:21,633
4:11?

716
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,760
Thank you, Maxine.

717
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,595
You're welcome.

718
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,419
Thanks so much for having
me over, sugarplum.

719
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,296
I'm glad you called.

720
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,465
Shall we to the boudoir?

721
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,345
A couple of minutes. I'm early.

722
00:55:22,862 --> 00:55:26,448
So do...do you enjoy being
an actor?

723
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:32,496
Sure. Yeah.
It's...it's very rewarding.

724
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,515
Hi.

725
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:53,433
Hi.

726
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,824
Oh, my sweet Maxine.

727
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,827
- My darling.
- I love you, Lotte.

728
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,670
Did you call me Lotte?

729
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,552
Do you mind?

730
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,139
No, not really.

731
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,059
- Oh!
- Oh, God.

732
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,853
- My sweet, beautiful Lotte.
- Oh!

733
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,147
Oh, Maxine!

734
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:43,567
Yes, Maxine. Yes.

735
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:46,444
Maxine, this is...
this is so right.

736
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:48,822
Oh! Oh, God.

737
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:01,209
- Yes! Wow!
- Yes! Wow!

738
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,288
You were him, weren't you?

739
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,497
Yeah.

740
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,374
And he was with her!

741
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,585
We love her, Craig.

742
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:44,836
"We"?

743
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,962
John and me.

744
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:47,088
Don't forget about me!

745
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:49,466
Well, you have the Maxine
action figure to play with!

746
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:54,387
I'm sorry. That was nasty.

747
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,586
You are late, my little cowboy.

748
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:31,925
Are you torturing me
on purpose?

749
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,594
I've fallen in love.

750
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:36,971
I don't think so.

751
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:39,933
You know why?
Because I've fallen in love!

752
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,268
And this is what people who
have fallen in love look like.

753
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:45,021
Well, you picked
the unrequited variety.

754
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:47,357
It's very bad for the skin.

755
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:53,488
You're evil, Maxine.

756
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:57,200
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have two people look at you

757
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:01,287
with total lust and devotion
through the same pair of eyes?

758
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:04,958
Wow.

759
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:07,627
No, I don't suppose you would.

760
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:09,421
It's quite a thrill, Craigy.

761
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,763
Ahh! What are you doing?

762
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,598
Oh, my God! Is that real?

763
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:02,682
- Yes!
- What is that?

764
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:04,309
I don't know
how to use it very well,

765
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:07,145
so don't make any sudden moves!

766
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,400
I'm serious! I'm serious.

767
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,027
Suck my dick!

768
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,906
Shut up, okay? Just shut up.

769
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:35,340
Craig!

770
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:41,513
J.M. Inc. Be all
that someone else can be.

771
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,807
I need to see you.

772
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:45,391
Sweetie!

773
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,645
Oh, I had so much fun
with you last night.

774
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,939
Shoot. But it's business hours.

775
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,319
Tell her what the hell,
close early, live dangerously.

776
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,821
Say it.

777
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,242
What the hell, you know?

778
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:07,121
Live dangerously. Close early.

779
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:08,748
Ooh, doll.

780
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:11,960
I love this new
devil-may-care side of you.

781
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:17,674
All righty. I'll track down lover boy
and see both of you in one hour.

782
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:19,300
Exactamundo.

783
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:26,307
Craig!

784
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:29,853
What's the matter with you?
Stop it!

785
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,939
Sit up, okay?
Just sit up. Just sit up.

786
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:44,242
Help!
He's locking me in a cage!

787
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:47,996
Shut up!

788
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,831
Shut up!

789
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:03,970
Was ever woman
in this humor wooed?

790
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,390
Was ever woman
in this humor won?

791
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,315
Tommy, can I take 15?

792
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:22,196
- Good night, everybody.
- See you back here at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow.

793
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:28,703
Oh!

794
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,997
Oh, Lotte.

795
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:34,125
Lotte, this is so good!

796
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:38,171
- My God! This is amazing.
- Lotte!

797
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:42,091
I want to touch her breast.
Touch her breast.

798
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,928
Move right hand
across left breast now.

799
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:47,472
- Lotte! - Move right hand
across left breast now!

800
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,515
Move right hand
across left breast now.

801
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,767
Holy shit, yes!

802
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,518
Holy shit, yes!

803
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:54,103
Holy shit, he said what I said!

804
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:56,189
Shit, he said what I said!

805
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:59,108
Lotte? Is that you?

806
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:00,610
Yes, yes, sweetheart.

807
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,570
Yes, sweetheart, yes.

808
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,864
What the fuck is going on?

809
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:06,908
That's not me!
I didn't say that.

810
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:08,159
Oh, Lotte.

811
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,535
Oh, Maxine. Oh...

812
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,165
Something was making me talk.

813
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:17,251
Some goddamn thing
was making me move.

814
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:19,754
- I've gotta get out of here.
- Oh, doll face!

815
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:23,257
It was just, uh, your
passion for me taking hold.

816
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:28,388
No, doll face. I know what my
passion taking hold feels like.

817
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:29,639
Bye!

818
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,307
I did it!

819
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:36,729
I made him move his arms across
your girlfriend's glorious tit!

820
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:41,109
Oh, and
I made him talk sort of.

821
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,320
It's just a matter of practice

822
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:49,492
before Malkovich is nothing more than another
puppet hanging next to my work table.

823
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:53,997
I'll tell you about it when I
get home, okay? All right?

824
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:57,583
- Craig! Craig!
- I wanna...

825
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,679
No, man, I'm sorry to...

826
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,181
I'm sorry to have
called you like that,

827
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,934
but I was just really,
really scared.

828
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,853
I was so freaked out.

829
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:22,025
I mean, it was like somebody was
just moving all the way through me,

830
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:24,986
moving my arms, moving my
hands, talking for me.

831
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,364
I mean, literally, I feel
like I'm going crazy, Charlie.

832
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:30,199
I'm sure
you're not going crazy.

833
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:32,618
You don't understand, man.
It was like nothing I've ever felt before.

834
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:35,621
Yeah, yada, yada, yada.
Were you stoned?

835
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:37,915
Yes. Yes, I was... Jesus.

836
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:43,129
Yes! Yes, I was stoned.

837
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,257
But what... That doesn't have
anything to do with it.

838
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,885
Charlie, someone was talking
through my mouth.

839
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:50,928
You were stoned.

840
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:53,139
Case closed. End of story.

841
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:56,642
- How hot is this babe?
- You know what?

842
01:04:57,144 --> 01:04:59,896
Maybe it was this
Lotte woman talking

843
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,774
because it could have been her
talking through me.

844
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,358
Because this...

845
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:07,862
The weird thing is this Maxine
likes to call me Lotte.

846
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,782
Ouch. That is hot.

847
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:15,411
Maybe she's using you to channel
some dead, lesbian lover.

848
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:17,914
Sounds like my kind of gal.
Let me know when you're done with her, yeah?

849
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:22,210
What are you talking about? Done with her, man?
Tonight really freaked me out.

850
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:24,754
You're nuts to let a girl go
that calls you Lotte.

851
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:25,922
I'll tell you that as a friend.

852
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:28,508
Charlie, I don't know
anything about the girl.

853
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,968
She could be, like,
a fucking witch or something.

854
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,762
That's even better!

855
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,516
Hot, lesbian witches. Think about it.
It's fucking genius.

856
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,020
I gotta know the truth,
Charlie.

857
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:44,607
The truth is for suckers,
Johnny boy.

858
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:30,153
Thanks.

859
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,203
Excuse me, sir.

860
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:24,332
Exactly what, uh, type of service
does this company provide?

861
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:27,460
You get to be John Malkovich
for 15 minutes.

862
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,921
Two hundred clams.

863
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:33,549
I see.

864
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,552
- No cutting, by the way. No cutting!
- Hey, what the hell?

865
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:46,020
Come on! Break it up!
Break it up! Cut it out!

866
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:47,480
Everybody gets...

867
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,315
- It's him.
- It's John Malkovich.

868
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,817
I'm sorry, Mr. Malkovich.
I hope we didn't hurt you too terribly.

869
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:53,361
Get inside!

870
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,823
- Darling!
- What the fuck is going on?

871
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:00,159
- Uh, uh, John Malkovich.
- Huh?

872
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:02,161
Mr. Malkovich, sir.

873
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:07,792
Mr. Malkovich,
I think I can explain.

874
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:09,252
Yeah, explain.

875
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:11,420
My name is Craig Schwartz

876
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,257
and we operate
a little business here

877
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:17,510
that simulates,
for our clientele, well, the...

878
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:22,473
the experience of... of...
of being you, actually.

879
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:23,766
Simulates?

880
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,601
Yeah, after a fashion.

881
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:27,728
What exactly does that mean?

882
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:29,480
Well, it's hard to describe.

883
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:30,648
I want to do it then.

884
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:32,775
That would pale in comparison
to the actual experience.

885
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,151
I want to do it!

886
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:35,778
Right now
Mr. Hiroshi's in the tube...

887
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,738
Let him do it, Craig.

888
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,449
Of course.
Right this way, Mr. Malkovich,

889
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:42,535
compliments of the house.

890
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:52,169
Jesus.

891
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:10,730
What happens when a man
goes through his own portal?

892
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,399
We'll see.

893
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:46,307
Malkovich.

894
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,018
Malkovich, Malkovich.

895
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,480
Malkovich, Malkovich.

896
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:54,982
Malkovich, Malkovich,
Malkovich?

897
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:56,942
Malkovich, Malkovich.

898
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,694
Malkovich?

899
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:08,662
Malkovich!

900
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,122
Malkovich.

901
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,793
Malkovich.

902
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,671
Malkovich. Malkovich.

903
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,552
Malkovich!

904
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:26,680
Malkovich, Malkovich

905
01:10:26,765 --> 01:10:30,142
Malkovich, Malkovich

906
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,811
- Malkovich.
- Malkovich.

907
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:34,230
- Malkovich.
- Malkovich.

908
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:37,775
Malkovich, Malkovich

909
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:42,154
Malkovich, Malkovich

910
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,533
- Malkovich, Malkovich
- Malkovich!

911
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,792
How was it?

912
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,460
It was amazing this time.

913
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:58,129
That was no simulation!

914
01:10:58,213 --> 01:10:59,922
I know. I'm sorry.

915
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,382
It's such an honor.

916
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,092
I have been to the dark side.

917
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:05,594
I have seen a world
that no man should see!

918
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:09,056
Really? For most people, it's
a rather pleasant experience.

919
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:10,766
That portal is mine,

920
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:14,645
and it must be sealed forever
for the love of God.

921
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:19,400
But, Mr. Malkovich, sir,
with all due respect,

922
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:23,779
I discovered that portal.
It's my livelihood. Do you understand?

923
01:11:23,864 --> 01:11:28,325
It's my head, Schwartz!
It's my head!

924
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,829
I will see you in court!

925
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:39,086
What makes you think I won't be
seeing what you're seeing in court?

926
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:41,130
Hey, Malkovich, think fast!

927
01:11:43,425 --> 01:11:44,633
Fuck!

928
01:11:45,594 --> 01:11:47,094
Dinner.

929
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:53,184
You know, Craig, once this was
a relationship built on love.

930
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,520
Well, you gave up that claim

931
01:11:56,605 --> 01:11:59,482
after the first time you stuck
your dick in Maxine, Lotte.

932
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:01,567
You fell in love with her
first, Craig.

933
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:06,280
Yeah, but I didn't do anything about
it, out of respect for our marriage.

934
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:09,325
You didn't do anything
about it, Craig,

935
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:15,039
out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't
let you near her with a ten-foot pole!

936
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,713
That's true.

937
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,678
God, Lotte, what have I become?

938
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:34,433
My wife in a cage
with a monkey.

939
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:38,979
Craig. I need to go to the
bathroom and take a shower.

940
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:48,822
What am I,
some kind of monster?

941
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:53,160
I don't want to be a monster,
Lotte. I don't want to.

942
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:55,663
Craig, you're not a monster.
No.

943
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:58,499
I know you're not a monster,
honey.

944
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,960
You're just... You're just

945
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:04,630
a very, very confused man.

946
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,593
I love you so much.

947
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:14,974
I love you.

948
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:26,235
Come on, Craig.

949
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:36,996
- J.M. Inc.
- Maxine?

950
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,164
Lotte.

951
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,668
I've been thinking about us,
you know? And, uh...

952
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,169
We have to meet.

953
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:47,381
Um, okay. I'll see you in
Malkovich in one hour.

954
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,009
Craig!

955
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:54,054
I hate you.

956
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:17,805
Oh, Elijah!
You really are magnificent.

957
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:24,186
- J.M. Inc.
- Maxine!

958
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,022
Honey pie! I was just heading
out the door to meet you.

959
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:31,110
No, listen, Maxine.
It hasn't been me in Malkovich the last time.

960
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,695
It's been that
son of a bitch, Craig.

961
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:35,072
He's had me locked in the cage
with my chimp,

962
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,533
- holding a gun to my head.
He made me call you. - Oh, my God!

963
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,910
I'm sorry, Maxine.
It's been him the whole time.

964
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:42,496
I'm so sorry. That's horrible.

965
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,998
I miss you so much, Maxine.

966
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:46,500
So... But...

967
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:49,336
Okay, that was Craig
inside of Malkovich?

968
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:52,965
Yes, it was him.
It's because he's a puppeteer, I think.

969
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,926
Well, boy, I'm, uh...

970
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:58,721
I'm surprised.
That's pretty impressive.

971
01:15:58,805 --> 01:15:59,972
What?

972
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,599
So if Craig
can control Malkovich,

973
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:05,519
- and I can control Craig...
- But, Maxine,

974
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:08,272
I thought it was me
that you loved!

975
01:16:08,982 --> 01:16:10,232
I do.

976
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:18,782
It's confusing, you know?
This is a very confusing situation.

977
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:20,951
I know.

978
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:28,208
Listen, I
should really get going, okay?

979
01:16:28,293 --> 01:16:31,003
- 'Cause I'm gonna be late
for Malkovich now. - No.

980
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,171
What?

981
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:33,922
We'll talk about this later,
Lotte.

982
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:35,674
Maxine! Wait!

983
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:38,427
- Okay?
- Maxine!

984
01:17:10,794 --> 01:17:12,920
What the fuck do you want?

985
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:16,006
I can explain
about the portal, darling.

986
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,970
Listen, don't con me, Maxine.

987
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:23,639
I don't know
who the hell you people are,

988
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:26,350
but this insanity is now over.

989
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:27,976
Oh, shut up.

990
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:31,480
Craigy. Craig.

991
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:33,941
Schwartzy, are you in there?

992
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:41,573
How did you know it was me?

993
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:44,743
Lotte called me.
She escaped your evil clutches.

994
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:49,456
Really? Well, I'm really sorry
I did that, Maxine,

995
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:50,833
but I'm
really in love with you,

996
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,544
and I didn't know
how else to be with you.

997
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:54,795
Hmm.

998
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,174
Apparently you can control
this Malkovich fellow now?

999
01:17:59,259 --> 01:18:01,760
Yes, I'm getting
better all the time.

1000
01:18:01,845 --> 01:18:03,637
I'll say you are.

1001
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,765
Hey, let's do it
on his dining room table.

1002
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,184
Then we'll make him
eat an omelet off of it.

1003
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:10,811
No!

1004
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,688
Shut up,
you overrated sack of shit!

1005
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:16,942
Craigy.

1006
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:43,427
Yes?

1007
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:47,556
Hi, Dr. Lester.
It's Lotte Schwartz,

1008
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:50,267
Craig's wife.

1009
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:53,228
Oh! Yes. Oh, my God.

1010
01:18:53,313 --> 01:18:56,064
You'll catch your death out here.
Look at you. You're soaking wet.

1011
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:58,317
Please come in, come in.

1012
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:07,075
Here you are, my dear.

1013
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,577
Thank you.

1014
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,455
How's that?

1015
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,665
Much better, thank you.

1016
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,836
So, my dear, what is it that
brings you to my doorway

1017
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:20,297
on such
an inhospitable evening?

1018
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,049
Well, Dr. Lester,

1019
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:24,009
see, I, uh...

1020
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:28,889
I have a very unhealthy
obsession with John Malkovich.

1021
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,017
I see.

1022
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,394
You mean, the performer.

1023
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:36,730
Yes.

1024
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:40,859
And what prompted you
to come to me with this issue?

1025
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:44,613
Well, when I was here
with my husband for dinner,

1026
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:50,285
I came upon a room that seemed to be
some sort of John Malkovich museum.

1027
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,872
So I thought
perhaps maybe you would

1028
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,917
have some appreciation
for my state of mind.

1029
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:01,880
You look so lovely, my dear,

1030
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:05,759
standing here before the fire
in my oversized man's robe.

1031
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:10,180
Thank you, Dr. Lester.

1032
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:13,934
Tell me,

1033
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:18,063
what is this strange power
that Malkovich exudes?

1034
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:21,024
You've gotta help me
understand because

1035
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:23,860
all I think about
is wanting to be him.

1036
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,864
- Wanting to what?
- Wanting to be him.

1037
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,742
Wanting to be John Malkovich.

1038
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:33,954
Oh, I see.

1039
01:20:35,123 --> 01:20:38,041
Well, perhaps you can.

1040
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,293
But, Dr. Lester...

1041
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:43,588
I am not Dr. Lester.

1042
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:46,258
I am Captain Mertin.

1043
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:49,219
I don't understand.

1044
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:53,849
It was 90 years ago that I
discovered a strange portal.

1045
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:58,186
And... And I found that this
portal led to a vessel body

1046
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:02,315
and that I could live forever by
leaping from vessel to vessel.

1047
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,946
So Dr. Lester is such a vessel?

1048
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:09,614
Yes, he is.

1049
01:21:11,034 --> 01:21:13,035
You still there, sweets?

1050
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:14,536
Hmm.

1051
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:20,417
I figured out how to hang on
as long as I want.

1052
01:21:20,835 --> 01:21:24,171
It's all a matter of making
friends with the Malkovich body.

1053
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:28,508
Rather than thinking of it as an enemy
that has to be pounded into submission,

1054
01:21:28,593 --> 01:21:33,472
I've begun imagining it as a really
expensive suit that I enjoy wearing.

1055
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:47,152
Ah, this illustrates how I will move
into my next vessel, Malkovich,

1056
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:49,404
on his 44th birthday.

1057
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:51,490
That's when he becomes ripe.

1058
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:54,534
But I must enter
by midnight on that day.

1059
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:59,331
After that, I'd get diverted into the
next newly forming infant vessel.

1060
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:01,416
I don't want that to happen.

1061
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:03,293
I'd be absorbed.

1062
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:05,295
Absorbed? What does that mean?

1063
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:09,674
Well, uh, trapped, held prisoner,
if you like, in the host's brain,

1064
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,635
unable to control anything,

1065
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:15,680
forever doomed to watch the world
through someone else's eyes.

1066
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:20,477
Now I'd like you
to meet some friends.

1067
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,813
See, I got lonely
in Lester by myself,

1068
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:26,608
so I figured out a way this time
to take others along with me.

1069
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:27,776
Come.

1070
01:22:33,324 --> 01:22:35,575
Everyone, this is Lotte.

1071
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,285
Hi, Lotte!

1072
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:39,246
She's a new friend of mine.

1073
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:47,712
Do a puppet show for me,
Craig, honey.

1074
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,799
You mean, with Malkovich?

1075
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:53,510
- I'd love to see your work.
- Really?

1076
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,220
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

1077
01:22:57,265 --> 01:22:58,557
Okay.

1078
01:23:07,692 --> 01:23:13,697
This is something that I call "Craig's
Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

1079
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:50,502
That was incredible!
You're... You're brilliant!

1080
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:54,464
You see, Maxine, it isn't
just playing with dolls.

1081
01:24:55,341 --> 01:24:57,759
Oh, my darling,
it's so much more!

1082
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:00,011
It's playing with people.

1083
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:07,477
Stay in him forever.

1084
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:12,399
My darling, how will we make
a living if our clientele

1085
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:15,026
doesn't have access
to our product?

1086
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:18,947
Well, we'll have all the money
in Malkovich's bank account,

1087
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:21,074
plus he does get
acting work occasionally.

1088
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:23,034
No, please!

1089
01:25:23,661 --> 01:25:25,578
Shut up!
We're trying to think here.

1090
01:25:25,663 --> 01:25:26,871
Gee!

1091
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:32,627
It is... It is sort of
like puppeteering.

1092
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,213
I-I-I like that about it.

1093
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:36,840
Exactly!

1094
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:41,886
And no one would ever even
have to know it's not him.

1095
01:25:44,307 --> 01:25:47,309
And I could use
Malkovich's existing notoriety

1096
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:50,061
to launch my own
puppeteering career.

1097
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:52,981
Oh, Craigy.
Craigy, that's brilliant.

1098
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:54,441
Oh. Oh.

1099
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:55,608
So lovely.

1100
01:25:55,693 --> 01:25:58,570
I've always wondered what it
would be like to have a penis.

1101
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,155
- Now I'll know.
- Really?

1102
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,240
- I know it's very...
- Lotte?

1103
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:04,326
We like you.

1104
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:07,537
We can see you're a kind
and decent woman

1105
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,748
and so,

1106
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:14,252
we've decided to offer you a
place in John Malkovich with us,

1107
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:16,254
if you like.

1108
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:22,385
Dr. Lester,

1109
01:26:23,054 --> 01:26:26,890
you've been so kind to me
and trusting.

1110
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:33,563
And there's just something I think you
should know about the Malkovich vessel.

1111
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,608
- John's here to see you.
- Should I send him in?

1112
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:40,445
Of course send him right in.
Don't ever keep him waiting again, you understand?

1113
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,700
Hey, John.

1114
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:47,577
Great to see you.

1115
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:49,371
Sorry about the cunt
at reception.

1116
01:26:49,455 --> 01:26:51,539
This is my fiancee, Maxine.

1117
01:26:51,624 --> 01:26:53,375
Oh, great to see you, Maxine.

1118
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:54,584
Sorry about the cunt
at reception.

1119
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:56,628
Please, have a seat.

1120
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:04,511
Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Water?

1121
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,471
No, thank you.

1122
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:09,224
- Teresa, get me chicken soup.
- Okay.

1123
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:11,309
Chicken soup? Chicken soup?

1124
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:21,736
Larry? Uh, I want to
get right to the point.

1125
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:25,198
From now on, I'm no longer an actor.
I'm a puppeteer.

1126
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:28,159
Okay. Great.

1127
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:36,167
And I would like
to redirect my career

1128
01:27:36,252 --> 01:27:39,212
so that from now on
the name John Malkovich,

1129
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:42,549
will be synonymous
with puppets.

1130
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:45,468
Sure. Sure. No problemo.

1131
01:27:45,553 --> 01:27:47,095
Poof, you're a puppeteer.

1132
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:49,639
Just let me
make a couple calls.

1133
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:13,955
Honey?

1134
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:17,876
Maxine? Maxine?

1135
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:20,211
I'm busy.

1136
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:24,924
Maxine, honey, it's on!

1137
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,810
Yeah, there's the truth,
and there are lies

1138
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:39,564
and, uh, art always tells the
truth, even when it's lying.

1139
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:42,108
The enigmatic John Malkovich,

1140
01:28:42,193 --> 01:28:44,152
one of the world's
greatest entertainers

1141
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:47,489
and the man who reinvented
how we view puppeteering.

1142
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:50,158
Tonight we look at the man
above the strings

1143
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:52,577
and the woman behind the man.

1144
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:57,665
Raised in Evanston, Illinois, Malkovich
had a lifelong interest in theater arts

1145
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,168
and as a young man was
one of the founding members

1146
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:03,880
of Chicago's world-renowned
Steppenwolf Theatre Company.

1147
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:06,174
From there, it was a simple
hop, skip and a jump

1148
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:09,177
to Broadway accolades
and Hollywood stardom.

1149
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:13,348
But nothing could prepare the
public for what was to come next.

1150
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:16,684
And so it was that just
eight short months ago,

1151
01:29:16,769 --> 01:29:18,853
John Malkovich
dropped the bombshell

1152
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:21,898
that sent shock waves through
the entertainment community.

1153
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:24,359
Turning his back on
his former profession,

1154
01:29:24,443 --> 01:29:26,486
Malkovich had to
start from scratch

1155
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:30,031
and pay his dues all over again
as a fledgling puppeteer.

1156
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:34,202
Hello, ladies and
gentlemen, I'm John Malkovich.

1157
01:29:34,453 --> 01:29:38,206
It's... It's the... I miss...
I'm really John Malkovich.

1158
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,167
From these
inauspicious beginnings...

1159
01:29:41,252 --> 01:29:45,171
John Malkovich's rise to
stardom was fast and furious.

1160
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:48,299
His breakout performance occurred
at this year's Emmy Awards...

1161
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,134
It's really good!

1162
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:52,929
I look really amazing.
I'd fuck me.

1163
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:55,557
If there's anything
that upsets me about it,

1164
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:58,518
it's feeling like
if I move into it too quickly,

1165
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:01,062
I'll be, you know,
deemed an imitator.

1166
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:04,232
But, um, I think that once
we all get the courage

1167
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:07,193
to just follow through on our
instincts, like Malkovich has,

1168
01:30:07,278 --> 01:30:10,154
I think that, uh, a lot of us
will move into puppetry.

1169
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,739
Malkovich's rise to fame

1170
01:30:11,824 --> 01:30:14,242
brought about
a renaissance in puppeteering.

1171
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:16,911
No, no, no. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1172
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:18,413
I'm making him weep, John.

1173
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:21,666
You're making him weep,
but you are not weeping.

1174
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,501
Don't ever with your audience.

1175
01:30:23,586 --> 01:30:29,591
Until the... the puppet becomes an
extension of you, it's a novelty act.

1176
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:32,343
It's, uh... It's Topo Gigio.

1177
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:34,012
No?

1178
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,766
He's a technical genius.

1179
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:41,644
He breathes life
into inanimate objects.

1180
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:46,608
It's a very godlike thing to
be able to take something and,

1181
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:48,610
you know, make it live.

1182
01:30:48,694 --> 01:30:53,031
He was the talk of the
town from the Beltway to Broadway

1183
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:57,952
aided in no small part by his new
wife and manager, Maxine Lund.

1184
01:30:58,537 --> 01:31:01,414
In Maxine,
Malkovich had found his mentor

1185
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:04,042
his muse, his inspiration.

1186
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:08,713
In Malkovich, Maxine had
found the love of her life.

1187
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,383
There, there, my dear. Relax.

1188
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:16,471
This travesty will all
be over with by morning.

1189
01:31:16,722 --> 01:31:19,474
And the crowds have been
absolutely sensational

1190
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:22,935
and, um, I'd just like to thank God
for giving us this opportunity

1191
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:25,021
to share our creative vision.

1192
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:26,397
Nothing was impossible

1193
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:28,816
for John and Maxine
in the early days.

1194
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:30,735
Their union was a joyous one,

1195
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,487
and together
they worked tirelessly

1196
01:31:32,571 --> 01:31:34,989
to further Malkovich's
puppeteering career.

1197
01:31:35,074 --> 01:31:39,702
John Malkovich, the artist,
and Maxine, the entrepreneur,

1198
01:31:39,787 --> 01:31:41,829
they make this character,

1199
01:31:41,914 --> 01:31:45,625
this protean figure
that we call John Malkovich.

1200
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:49,837
But some say Maxine has changed
since becoming pregnant,

1201
01:31:49,922 --> 01:31:53,216
recoiling from the limelight
and, rumor has it,

1202
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:56,052
from her husband's affections.

1203
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:06,229
I'm so sorry.

1204
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:14,112
Malkovich shows us

1205
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:17,949
a reflection of ourselves,
our frailties

1206
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:21,244
and our, you know,

1207
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:23,454
desperate humanity.

1208
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:28,167
That's what makes him one of the
most relevant artists of our time.

1209
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:32,547
And what does the future
hold for John Horatio Malkovich?

1210
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:37,051
Well, to quote the Bard, "He's
got the world on a string."

1211
01:32:37,136 --> 01:32:38,761
As the poet said,

1212
01:32:38,846 --> 01:32:42,390
"The puppeteer's voice need not
merely be the record of man.

1213
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:44,767
"It can be one of the pillars,
the props,

1214
01:32:44,852 --> 01:32:47,103
"to help him endure
and prevail."

1215
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:49,147
And I believe that.

1216
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:50,982
It's over!

1217
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:54,777
Max?

1218
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:58,239
I've gotta head down
to ABT now.

1219
01:32:58,323 --> 01:33:01,367
I've got the Swan Lake
benefit tonight, okay?

1220
01:33:01,452 --> 01:33:06,748
But when I come back, we can maybe
celebrate Malkovich's big four-four.

1221
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,125
Okay?

1222
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:13,713
Jesus! Why couldn't I have found
the portal to a younger body?

1223
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:17,175
What if I... What if I
fall tonight and break my hip?

1224
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:10,061
Like that, little girl?

1225
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:13,105
Huh, lamb?

1226
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:16,818
I love you.

1227
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,895
Bravo!

1228
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:01,445
Maxine?

1229
01:35:08,996 --> 01:35:10,288
Ma...

1230
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:23,217
Hello? Hello?

1231
01:35:23,302 --> 01:35:24,719
We have Maxine.

1232
01:35:24,803 --> 01:35:28,222
Oh! My God.
Please, please, don't hurt her.

1233
01:35:28,307 --> 01:35:31,767
Listen, I'll... I'll give you
anything you want. Please.

1234
01:35:31,852 --> 01:35:34,395
You listen to me, asshole.
I don't want your fucking money.

1235
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,773
What I want is for you
to leave John Malkovich now!

1236
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:40,568
Who... Who is this, Lester?

1237
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:41,736
Does it matter?

1238
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:44,655
We're gonna kill Maxine if you
don't leave the body immediately!

1239
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:49,410
But I-I-I can't do that.
I mean, if-if I leave Malkovich,

1240
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:53,122
then I'm Craig Schwartz again.
No career, no money.

1241
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:54,540
Maxine will have
nothing to do...

1242
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:56,751
She barely has anything
to do with me now.

1243
01:35:56,835 --> 01:36:00,254
Jesus, we're going to kill your
wife, you fucking lunatic!

1244
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,007
God.

1245
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:05,426
Listen, Schwartz,
Malkovich is our vessel.

1246
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:09,513
We're old. We're going to die if
we don't get into him by midni...

1247
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,989
He called our bluff.

1248
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:30,534
Shit!

1249
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,497
Can't we just go inside the
portal and push Craig out?

1250
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:36,457
No, he's much too powerful.

1251
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:40,378
Schwartz would just jam us down
into Malkovich's subconscious.

1252
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:06,237
Lotte.

1253
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:11,826
If I can't have you,
no one will.

1254
01:37:15,247 --> 01:37:17,415
Lotte, no!

1255
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:20,960
No, Lotte! God, no,
we can't really kill her!

1256
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:24,714
She's carrying Malkovich's seed!
Our next vessel!

1257
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:34,682
Hey! Help me!

1258
01:37:35,726 --> 01:37:37,143
Help me!

1259
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:40,021
Where the fuck am I?

1260
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:42,565
We're in
Malkovich's subconscious.

1261
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:45,234
The last thing
you'll ever see, Maxine.

1262
01:37:47,946 --> 01:37:49,530
Fag-o-vitch!

1263
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,991
Johnny, baby, Johnny.

1264
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:02,918
- I am bad. I am bad. I am bad.
- I am bad. I am bad. I am bad.

1265
01:38:03,003 --> 01:38:04,879
I am bad. I am bad.

1266
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:07,798
I am bad. I am bad. I am bad.

1267
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:10,801
I am bad. I am bad. I am bad.

1268
01:38:22,147 --> 01:38:24,607
Maxine, I am gonna kill you!

1269
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:30,446
You're creepy.

1270
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:45,836
- Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!
- Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!

1271
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:48,881
Wet his pants so all could see!

1272
01:38:48,965 --> 01:38:53,803
Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!
Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!

1273
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:57,765
Wet his pants so all could see!

1274
01:39:11,905 --> 01:39:13,864
I loved you so much!

1275
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:18,786
Oh! Why did you have to
hurt me like that?

1276
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:20,788
I'm sorry, Lotte.

1277
01:39:21,081 --> 01:39:25,084
I guess I loved you, too,
in my way.

1278
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:29,547
You are so full of shit,
Maxine!

1279
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:31,382
I know.

1280
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:33,884
I know!

1281
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:40,349
It's your baby, okay?

1282
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,060
What?

1283
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,397
The baby, it's yours.

1284
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:50,985
It's ours. I got pregnant
when you were in Malkovich.

1285
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:53,696
You cannot fuck with me
anymore, Maxine!

1286
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,114
I'm not!

1287
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:59,076
I kept it because I knew
you were the father,

1288
01:40:01,872 --> 01:40:04,832
the other mother, whatever,
because I...

1289
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,917
Because it was yours.

1290
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:11,630
So we're parents?

1291
01:40:13,592 --> 01:40:14,925
Together?

1292
01:40:17,012 --> 01:40:18,304
Yeah.

1293
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:41,202
Say, uh,
aren't you John Malkovich?

1294
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:43,579
- No.
- Yeah, you are.

1295
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:44,788
No.

1296
01:40:45,123 --> 01:40:47,208
I can't believe
you're in this shithole, man.

1297
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:49,543
You guys know
this is John Malkovich?

1298
01:40:49,628 --> 01:40:50,920
I'm not John Malkovich.

1299
01:40:51,004 --> 01:40:52,546
This is John Malkovich...

1300
01:40:52,631 --> 01:40:55,090
I am not John Malkovich!

1301
01:40:55,175 --> 01:40:57,593
Cut it out, you guys.

1302
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,984
- Yes?
- Lester, please don't do it.

1303
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:15,694
Please don't kill Maxine.

1304
01:41:15,779 --> 01:41:16,820
So you'll leave?

1305
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:19,073
Yes, I said...
I, uh...I am leaving.

1306
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:22,868
All right. Do it now while I'm
on the phone so I can hear

1307
01:41:23,245 --> 01:41:24,912
and your lovely bride walks.

1308
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,706
Uh... Okay. Okay.

1309
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:30,167
I'm going.

1310
01:41:40,262 --> 01:41:42,596
Now, my friends.
The time is now.

1311
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:16,880
I'm free.

1312
01:42:20,677 --> 01:42:22,553
I'm back! I'm...

1313
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:40,404
Lotte.

1314
01:43:12,562 --> 01:43:13,771
Ooh!

1315
01:43:17,609 --> 01:43:20,110
Hello. Hello, young lady.
We're...

1316
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:23,238
Malk...

1317
01:43:23,323 --> 01:43:25,657
We're Malkovich.

1318
01:43:26,785 --> 01:43:28,660
Hey! Hey!

1319
01:43:28,745 --> 01:43:30,954
Maxine! I did it, Maxine!

1320
01:43:31,289 --> 01:43:33,207
I left Malkovich for you,
sweetie!

1321
01:43:33,291 --> 01:43:35,501
It's no good being Malkovich
without you.

1322
01:43:35,585 --> 01:43:36,877
It proves I love you!

1323
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:38,170
- Fuck off, Craig!
- Doesn't it?

1324
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:40,422
He's not with us.

1325
01:43:49,933 --> 01:43:52,393
Maxine, I love you!

1326
01:43:52,894 --> 01:43:54,561
I'm gonna go right back
into Malkovich

1327
01:43:54,646 --> 01:43:55,938
and I'm gonna kick Lester out!

1328
01:43:56,022 --> 01:43:57,731
And then you'll love me again!

1329
01:43:57,816 --> 01:44:00,484
Maxine! Maxine!

1330
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:16,166
Ma-Sheen.

1331
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:19,920
Hey. Malcatraz.
Uh, how are you?

1332
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:22,339
- I'm very well. And you?
- Good, good.

1333
01:44:22,424 --> 01:44:23,757
- You look well.
- Thank you.

1334
01:44:23,842 --> 01:44:26,468
- How's Celeste?
- She's good, yeah.

1335
01:44:26,553 --> 01:44:28,762
She's sorry she couldn't make it today.
She had to go to the store.

1336
01:44:28,847 --> 01:44:30,180
Oh, that's okay.

1337
01:44:30,265 --> 01:44:31,432
Charlie, hi!

1338
01:44:31,516 --> 01:44:32,891
I didn't even hear the door.

1339
01:44:32,976 --> 01:44:34,726
Lookin' great, Flo.

1340
01:44:34,811 --> 01:44:36,937
I'm looking grateful?

1341
01:44:39,065 --> 01:44:41,942
Charlie, we are not
getting any younger.

1342
01:44:42,402 --> 01:44:44,361
Well, don't rub it in.

1343
01:44:44,696 --> 01:44:47,364
Listen, Charlie, I know this
is going to sound crazy,

1344
01:44:47,449 --> 01:44:49,950
but what would you think
if I told you

1345
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:54,204
that I'd found a way for us
to live forever? All of us.

1346
01:44:55,582 --> 01:44:57,207
Johnny boy,
what are you talking about?

1347
01:44:57,292 --> 01:45:01,211
All of us. Celeste, Floris, you, me.
Gary Sinise maybe.

1348
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:06,175
I don't really understand.

1349
01:45:13,183 --> 01:45:16,894
Charlie, this is Emily.

1350
01:45:27,155 --> 01:45:28,906
Isn't she lovely?

1351
01:45:30,575 --> 01:45:32,701
- Hey, pass the Cheetos.
- You need more puffs?

1352
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:34,077
No, I want more.

1353
01:45:34,162 --> 01:45:36,121
Okeydoke.
They're covered in grease.

1354
01:45:36,206 --> 01:45:37,247
Shut up.

1355
01:45:37,332 --> 01:45:39,082
Can I swim yet?

1356
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,877
- Can you swim yet?
- What time is it?

1357
01:45:42,253 --> 01:45:43,670
Shall we do the cramp test?

1358
01:45:43,755 --> 01:45:45,297
Check her.

1359
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:49,468
Let me see. Are you gonna throw up?
Let me see!

1360
01:45:50,178 --> 01:45:52,930
Are you gonna throw up?
Are you gonna vomit?

1361
01:45:53,473 --> 01:45:55,516
Okay, you can swim.

1362
01:45:59,437 --> 01:46:01,188
Maxine.

1363
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:03,482
Maxine.

1364
01:46:04,609 --> 01:46:06,485
I love you, Maxine.

1365
01:46:08,446 --> 01:46:10,280
Oh, look away.

1366
01:46:10,949 --> 01:46:12,783
Look away.

1367
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:16,161
Look away. Look away.

1368
01:46:16,329 --> 01:46:19,122
Look away. Look away.

1369
01:46:19,707 --> 01:46:21,250
Look away.
