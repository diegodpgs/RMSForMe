1
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:14,819
Our five-day forecast. 

2
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:17,756
Next up, the tree girl
from Elkerton. 

3
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,689
Living in a tree for an entire year... 

4
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,161
Iocal girl, Rianna "Hummingbird"Holmes, 
is finally coming down. 

5
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:25,365
Unlike the better knownJulia Hill... 

6
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,890
the rest of Miss Holmes'forest
was leveled... 

7
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:30,596
though she did manage to save
one giant redwood tree. 

8
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,399
- All right!
- How are you doing? 

9
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:34,906
I just want to thank everyone
who sent me... 

10
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,466
food and letters of support. 

11
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:41,913
Especially the mentally handicapped
child who sent me this book of poems. 

12
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:45,008
She read my poems!

13
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:46,416
Thank you. 

14
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,819
Dimples!

15
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:23,856
Come on in the house!

16
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:31,761
Morning, Miss De La Rosa.
Dimples got out again.

17
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:33,231
I let him out.

18
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:37,094
Well, you have a good day now.

19
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,101
I am a warrior.

20
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:46,577
On your left.

21
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,248
Well, boys and girls... 

22
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:51,985
this is the most important room
in the entire police station.

23
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:55,088
this is the most important room
in the entire police station.

24
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:58,758
This is the police evidence room.
This is where I work.

25
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:00,727
Are you a real policeman?

26
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:01,995
Evidence fýle clerks
work very closely with real policemen.

27
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:04,259
Evidence fýle clerks
work very closely with real policemen.

28
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:06,489
So you're not a real policeman.

29
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:12,733
As soon as I pass the obstacle course,
I'm gonna be a real policeman.

30
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:13,932
Yeah, okay, pal.

31
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,637
All the evidence
is arranged by case number.

32
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,840
Do you realize
we're almost as tall as you?

33
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:24,847
This fýeld trip sucks.

34
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:28,985
I think I might have
some candy somewhere.

35
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,620
Look, everyone... marijuana!

36
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:34,957
I'm sorry. You're not allowed
to touch that. That's police evidence.

37
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:38,624
What are you gonna do... arrest us?
You're not a real cop.

38
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:40,132
Guys, that's really...

39
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:45,594
- I got him!
- Yea!

40
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,700
Mange!

41
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,674
What is going on in here?

42
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,980
Let me see that.

43
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,246
Thanks, Sarge.

44
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:05,258
Right there.
You're missing an "R."

45
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:08,158
There. Outstanding.

46
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:13,154
Now, who wants to go for a ride
with a real police offýcer?

47
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:20,704
- Marvin, what happened to you?
- Kids.

48
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:23,675
I can't believe you let a bunch
of eight-year-old kids embarrass you.

49
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,780
I'm gonna really do it
this time, Dad.

50
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:35,218
I'm gonna be a real policeman
just like you were.

51
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:37,848
I'll make you so proud of me.

52
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:40,860
I'm not gonna be
a huge loser anymore.

53
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,656
Give me that!

54
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:53,366
- Stretch it, Marvin!
- It won't go any further.

55
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,768
Back up. Let me give it a shot.
Come on, Marvin!

56
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:02,912
Maybe this year you won't
pee your pants and cry for your mama.

57
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:06,919
- That was a good one, Sarge.
- Don't worry. Nobody remembers that.

58
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,886
Listen up.

59
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:17,862
You have four minutes to complete...

60
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:21,389
the physical endurance portion
of your police examination.

61
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:25,332
I have personally
designed this course...

62
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:30,069
to simulate actual conditions
one might encounter...

63
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:31,804
in the fýeld.

64
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,778
Good luck.

65
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:42,853
Take a good look at that ass.
You'll be following it all day.

66
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:48,753
Ready! Set!

67
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,655
Go, Marvin! Go!

68
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,165
Go, Marvin! You got her!

69
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,758
Marvin, take her!

70
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:02,935
Kiss it!

71
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:18,313
Oh, okay. Right.

72
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,333
How does this simulate something
that would happen in the fýeld?

73
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:14,477
Come on, Marvin!

74
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:16,807
You got it! That's it!

75
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,533
- Marvin, you okay?
- At least you didn't pee in your pants.

76
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:50,946
Maybe we should wait
till everyone leaves.

77
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,518
Pop quiz. Who's this?

78
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,227
Mange!

79
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,970
That's four times in a row.

80
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:15,906
Refýlls?

81
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,412
Thank you.

82
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,280
- Y'all see that shit?
- What?

83
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:27,512
I'm sittin' in the middle,
and she poured my beer fýrst.

84
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,179
So?

85
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:30,984
Don't you see?
It's because I'm black.

86
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:33,525
Maybe she's just being nice.

87
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:36,153
- See, now we're gettin' to it.
- What?

88
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,255
What y'all call "nice,"
I call reverse racism.

89
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,459
"Let's be overly nice
to the black man.

90
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,162
Let's make up for his ancestors being
plucked from their homeland...

91
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:47,468
crammed by the hundreds
into leaky boats with no bathrooms...

92
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,941
like human tuna fýsh, and if most
of them didn't die on the way over...

93
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,138
they would have to go into show business
to make a decent damn livin'."

94
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:56,341
And now she's gonna pour
my beer fýrst?

95
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,079
That's not gonna make up for 400 years
of injustice. No, sir. Not today.

96
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:03,878
I wish I was black.

97
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:06,221
I'd have my onion rings by now.

98
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,293
I gotta go take a wizzer.

99
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:28,105
Oh, geez, I'm sorry.

100
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:30,479
I didn't know anybody was in here.

101
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,519
There's a long line
in the ladies' room.

102
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:41,089
Wait.
You're Rianna "Hummingbird" Holmes.

103
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,994
Look, I think it's great
what you did, saving that tree...

104
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,932
even though they leveled
all those other trees.

105
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:53,238
Glad to see you're doing your part.

106
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:59,272
I'm sorry.
I'm wasting trees.

107
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:04,082
They should get one of those...

108
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,415
They should get one of those
blow jobby things.

109
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:12,483
I mean, hand jobbies...
I mean, hand blowers.

110
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,652
Bye.

111
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,198
I wrote you a poem.

112
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:27,163
Working out and eating
a high-protein diet is not enough. 

113
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,676
You need a high-potency, 
high-mineral, mega-amino... 

114
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,042
anabolic body-building supplement. 

115
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:35,376
Nothing legally
will give you all that... 

116
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:38,144
except Badger Milk. 

117
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:41,209
A badger can lift
20 times its body weight. 

118
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:43,380
Can you do that? 

119
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,287
Our potent supplement
is made up of 25% real badger milk. 

120
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:51,557
If you call now, you'll get... 

121
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,725
two cartons of Badger Milk
for the price of one. 

122
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:56,526
Check out the pecs on Yolanda. 

123
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:59,537
That is pure Badger Milk. 

124
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:07,573
Hey, Marv, could you
cover for me for a minute?

125
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,581
- I'm the only one here.
- No problem.

126
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,743
Everyone else is down
at the softball game. Thanks.

127
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,281
There's a softball game today?

128
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,421
Freeze, puke!

129
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:58,623
Put down that VCR!
Put it down!

130
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:01,189
Oh, you bought it, did you?

131
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,326
Oh, you have a receipt, do you?

132
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:10,164
My mistake.

133
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,269
I'm new on the force.

134
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,064
Police Department.
Can I help you?

135
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:37,102
This is Mr. Tam of Tam's Restaurant. 
I'm being robbed. 

136
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,196
Tam's Restaurant? That's terrible!
I go there all the time.

137
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,366
You guys have the best
orange-flavored bean cake.

138
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:45,468
- Thank you very much. 
- The chili peppers give it a real kick.

139
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:48,036
They're shooting at me now! 

140
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,207
Hold on.
I'll get some help.

141
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:55,654
Offýcers needed. I got a two-eleven.
Robbery in progress.

142
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:56,847
Hello? 

143
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,724
Outstanding.

144
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:03,557
Offýcers needed! Hello?

145
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:06,462
Can you just sit tight
until I can reach somebody?

146
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:16,440
I got a two-eleven in progress.
I'm in pursuit.

147
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,876
Hello? Two-eleven in progress!

148
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,586
That wasn't so bad.

149
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:06,939
- Thanks for the lift.
- Not at all.

150
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,271
Dimples, you okay?

151
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:51,887
The Badger Milk girl.

152
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:54,051
She seems nice.

153
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:24,623
Now, that's good badger milk.

154
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:23,014
- Hey, Fatty.
- I gotta go.

155
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,744
Marvin, where the hell
have you been?

156
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:28,013
Well, last night after you left,
I got a call.

157
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:31,511
Two-eleven. Robbery in progress
at Tam's Restaurant.

158
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,717
Marvin, it was over a week ago.

159
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,626
You've been missing for eight days.

160
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:38,492
- What?
- I tried to cover for you.

161
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:42,591
I told everyone you were an unreliable
drunk who disappears for days on end.

162
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,863
So I think you're okay.

163
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:48,395
- Thanks a lot.
- Are you all right, Marvin?

164
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:49,907
Do you wanna see a doctor?

165
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:55,442
No. I feel great.

166
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,428
- On your left.
- Sure, pass the old guy, big man!

167
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:11,862
- On your left.
- Sure, pass the old guy, big man!

168
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,232
- How's it goin'?
- What?

169
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,968
Shit!

170
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:32,540
Come on! Come on!

171
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:37,683
Come on, boy! Come on!

172
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,462
Oh, easy! Easy! Whoa!

173
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,771
Slow down.

174
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:05,178
Wow. You gotta show me
how you do that.

175
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,550
I wish I knew.
I'm Marvin.

176
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,781
I'm Rianna.

177
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,813
I know.
I met you in the men's room.

178
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:14,792
Oh, yeah. The fart guy.

179
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:22,200
So, are all these dogs yours?

180
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:24,793
Kind of.
I volunteer at a pet shelter.

181
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:27,169
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

182
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:30,664
I get to hang out with all sorts
of different animals and...

183
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:33,769
At least this time
I have a roof over my head.

184
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:41,142
Is something wrong?

185
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:46,221
No. Nothing's wrong. Why?

186
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:01,998
- Nice catch.
- Thank you.

187
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:04,008
You should come
by the shelter sometime.

188
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:07,171
You know, you could play
Frisbee with the dogs.

189
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:09,339
I'd like that.

190
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:12,741
Bye.

191
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,182
I'm sorry.

192
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,827
Miles, I gotta talk to you.

193
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:31,035
I didn't know you smoked.

194
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:34,702
I don't. It's illegal
to smoke in the airports.

195
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:37,867
I just wanted to show you
how bad it's gotten. Watch this.

196
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:48,281
See? Nobody even says anything
to me because I'm black.

197
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:50,788
"Oh, let's bend the rules
for the black guy.

198
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:53,017
Let's let him smoke
because he's black."

199
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:56,118
Just because all those old blues
musicians never got any royalties...

200
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:58,629
and had to play one-night gigs
until they were, like, a hundred...

201
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:01,894
just so they could pay for their whores,
and now I can smoke anywhere I want to.

202
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:05,061
- Man, that's bullshit.
- Something weird happened to me.

203
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:09,233
Yeah? Well, something weird happened
to me too. They made me supervisor.

204
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:12,368
- That's great.
- Is it? I've been here 16 days, Marvin.

205
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:16,939
That Filipino over there
has been here fýve years.

206
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:20,114
You know why
they made me supervisor?

207
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:21,380
Because you're black?

208
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,116
No. 'Cause that bitch is dumb.

209
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:31,427
Excuse me, sir.
I'm in a hurry.

210
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:34,064
Not until I check you
with my magic wand, you ain't.

211
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,395
Arms out.

212
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:38,660
I ordered the stuff from the TV,
and I think it's working.

213
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:42,070
- Flight 32 is now boarding. 
- Physically, there's...

214
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:49,273
That's odd.
Do you smell that?

215
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:54,786
- It's this way.
- What is?

216
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,152
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

217
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,133
What, are you crazy or something?
Let go of my leg!

218
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,138
Get off of me!

219
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:16,970
He's got drugs on him.
Check him.

220
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,373
What are you talkin' about?
This guy's clean.

221
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:24,882
- He's clean.
- You see?

222
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,975
You can go.

223
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:28,849
No, wait.

224
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:44,199
Hey.

225
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,506
I hope he's on our flight.

226
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:58,178
That's a huge bitch!

227
00:23:58,217 --> 00:24:00,447
Well, I don't know whose that is,
but that's not mine.

228
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:08,891
It's pure heroin. You're
pretty good, buddy. What's your name?

229
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:12,795
Mange. Marvin Mange.

230
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:14,457
You'll be hearing from us.

231
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:27,240
Chief Wilson, could you tell us
what happened at the airport?

232
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:32,113
The drugs were found by the newest
member on our force...

233
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:33,742
Marvin Mange.

234
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:39,347
Here to take you through the arrest
is Sergeant Doug Sisk.

235
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:43,886
Thank you, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen...

236
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:48,099
- The suspect flew in from Colombia...
- Excuse me.

237
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,067
I have a question for Offýcer Mange.

238
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:53,196
Is it true that you can smell things
in people's butts?

239
00:24:57,976 --> 00:24:59,102
I guess so.

240
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:01,840
Can you smell things
that are not in people's butts?

241
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:05,145
Like, say, things
in people's pants pockets or wallets?

242
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:09,313
Offýcer Mange,
I'm from the free press.

243
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,481
What's up my butt?

244
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:14,549
Uh, sir, I'd rather not.

245
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:16,522
Oh, come on. What's up there?

246
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:19,794
Car keys.

247
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:22,993
- He's good.
- Over here!

248
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:26,196
- No more questions.
- What about me, sir?

249
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:29,399
Over here, Offýcer Mange, please.

250
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:40,983
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

251
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:43,487
Look, I don't want to guess
what's up your butt, okay?

252
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:44,852
No, it's not that.

253
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:48,384
You see, I released you...

254
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,952
to see if you could function
normally in society.

255
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,294
But now you're attracting
too much attention.

256
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,926
I just can't take the chance.

257
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:59,971
- What are you talking about?
- I was the one that found you.

258
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:03,601
I put you back together.

259
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:07,845
Don't you remember the animals?

260
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:18,915
Well, how do you explain
your enhanced sense of smell...

261
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:23,121
your ability to run twice as fast
or jump ten feet in the air?

262
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:30,601
It's the Badger Milk.
I ordered it from the TV.

263
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:33,263
I need you to come with me.

264
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,333
You're crazy.
I'm not going anywhere with you.

265
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:43,474
Sorry about the dart.

266
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:48,943
I think you'll fýnd
everything you need here...

267
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:53,542
water, food, a place to work out.

268
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:00,123
Where am I?

269
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:03,423
Well, you were born here,
sort of.

270
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:07,057
You see, when I found you,
you were more dead than alive.

271
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:09,726
The only way to save you
was my groundbreaking procedure...

272
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:12,664
radical trans-species-ectomy.

273
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:15,673
- What's that mean?
- I put animal parts in you.

274
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:20,471
You put wild animals inside me?

275
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:24,447
I wish. I don't have
that kind of money.

276
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:28,475
Most of the animals I used
were abandoned by a Mexican circus...

277
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,785
or came from the private zoo
of a famous pop star.

278
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:33,685
Why, there's Mr. Giggles.

279
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:38,221
He really misses the pop star.

280
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:41,998
I'm not allowed to say who.

281
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:03,545
Your life is here with me now. Hmm?

282
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:14,331
Look, doc,
I appreciate you saving me.

283
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,800
Thank you. I think.

284
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:21,802
But whatever you did with the animals
is working for me.

285
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:26,504
So I'm just gonna go on
with my new life.

286
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:33,143
Your human side
may not be able to control it.

287
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:36,119
I have to go.

288
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:38,816
I have to try it.

289
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:41,491
I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.

290
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,533
Sit.

291
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:59,873
Listen up, shit stains.

292
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:04,378
I don't know how you worked
that balloon trick out of the guy's ass.

293
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,316
I don't.

294
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:08,579
But I'm watchin' ya.

295
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:14,558
Now, the fact of the matter is,
you're not even a full-fledged cop yet.

296
00:30:14,593 --> 00:30:16,288
You're not, okay?

297
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:19,194
And until you pass
your 30-day probation...

298
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:21,198
you belong to me.

299
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:27,433
I'll have you thrown out of here
so quick, it'll make your head spin.

300
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:30,741
All the best.

301
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:51,195
Don't be ashamed, son.
I've eaten out of the garbage before.

302
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:02,799
Yeah, this baby is
nailed down tight.

303
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:05,462
Not goin' anywhere.
All righty.

304
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:27,316
One minute, okay? Give me one minute.
I'll be right back.

305
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,827
He was trying to get out.

306
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:13,929
You might want to get
a cover for this.

307
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:16,906
Yeah, maybe. Come on back.

308
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:19,739
I'll show you the animals.

309
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,379
This is Molly.
She's a young turkey vulture.

310
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:28,277
Hey, baby.

311
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:30,878
Her parents
were killed by a hunter...

312
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:34,550
and we're having the hardest time
getting her to eat.

313
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:36,685
I'm worried she's not gonna make it.

314
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:50,399
She just misses her mom,
that's all.

315
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:53,000
She doesn't eat whole worms.

316
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,028
That was really amazing.

317
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,137
So, what do you think?

318
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,909
It's all right. He's nice.

319
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:30,812
There are a lot of animals in here.

320
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:33,476
Yeah, I know.
It's a little crowded.

321
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:37,951
I just don't have the heart
to turn any of them away.

322
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:41,890
But it's cool.
We're like one big, happy family.

323
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:51,761
This is Henry, the orangutan.
He's very affectionate.

324
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,876
He really likes people.
He just doesn't like other monkeys.

325
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,109
We have quite a collection
of exotic birds.

326
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:05,513
Macaws and...

327
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,882
My friend Cosmo's a parrot.

328
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:16,019
You are a good boy.

329
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:24,699
Parrots are one of the smartest
creatures in the animal kingdom.

330
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:27,671
- Really?
- Want some food? Want a peanut?

331
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,698
Yeah, it's been proven they have the
intelligence of a fýve-year-old child.

332
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:36,008
- A fýve-year-old?
- People think parrots just mimic...

333
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,981
but I actually think
they have thoughts of their own.

334
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:43,483
Some of them even have a vocabulary
of up to 200 words.

335
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:45,682
Cosmo here has about 150.

336
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:50,617
That's incredible.
I didn't know any of that.

337
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:51,992
Hi there.

338
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:56,864
Sometimes I feel like I get along
better with animals than people.

339
00:35:56,935 --> 00:36:00,632
Animals are simple. They're honest.
You know what I mean?

340
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:12,878
I guess I kind of like people better.

341
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:16,148
With animals, I just feel
like I'm one of them.

342
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:17,950
Easy, boy.

343
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:19,751
Do you ever feel that way?

344
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,927
It's crazy. Crazy.

345
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:29,700
Calm down.
What's the matter with you guys?

346
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:38,271
Guys, let me ask you
a serious question.

347
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:42,776
Do you ever have trouble
with control?

348
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:47,944
Yes. The fýrst thing you have to do
is admit you have a problem.

349
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:50,954
You have to come out and say,
"I am a porn addict."

350
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:52,956
Not that kind of control.

351
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:59,054
I've been having these animal urges.

352
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,567
Me too! I got this one crazy video on
the mating rituals of a hippopotamus.

353
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:13,944
He was trying to take my meat.

354
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:57,315
Hey, doc! Dr. Wilder!

355
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:05,686
There you go.
Tummy's all gone now.

356
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:11,133
Hmm. How is my boy?
I knew you'd come home.

357
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:13,828
I'm not "coming home."

358
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:22,578
Stop it!
You're not helping.

359
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:25,878
- Sorry.
- Look, doc, you were right.

360
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,909
This control thing is
a lot harder than I thought.

361
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:37,023
This might help. Here.

362
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:44,362
This morning,
I woke up in a butcher shop.

363
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:47,696
- I have no idea how I got there.
- Oh, I see.

364
00:38:56,714 --> 00:39:01,014
The other day,
I was eating out of a garbage can.

365
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:04,077
I bit someone, and then...

366
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:07,349
I made love to a mailbox.

367
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:15,898
Your subconscious is reverting
to a primal state.

368
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:20,395
That's why I wanted you
to stay here.

369
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:23,736
I was so sad when you left.

370
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:25,970
I thought we could be buddies.

371
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:27,978
I even gave you a name.

372
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,380
Snowball.

373
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:36,814
I already have a name.

374
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:40,415
Oh, Snowball
already has a name, hmm?

375
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,449
Who's a good boy, then?

376
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,788
I'm a good boy. I'm...
This is serious!

377
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:49,132
I'm turning into an animal here!

378
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:51,658
All right.

379
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:54,034
Four whole turkeys,
a dozen lamb shanks...

380
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:56,938
two salmon, my pet rabbit...

381
00:39:57,008 --> 00:39:59,772
Oh, Charlie. One ham hock.

382
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:13,322
You see? You didn't want the biscuit
because you satisfýed your hunger.

383
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:23,932
Now that I have your attention,
listen carefully.

384
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:27,869
You must anticipate your instincts...

385
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:31,898
satisfy your animal urges
before they take over.

386
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:34,001
Hunger will be
your biggest challenge.

387
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:36,273
There's also your sex drive.

388
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:40,747
If you like,
I could help you with that.

389
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:45,455
That's all right. I'm good.

390
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:08,409
I gotta go.

391
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:22,954
There are a few things
bothering me here.

392
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:27,054
I don't know how you got to the butcher
shop break-in before I did...

393
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:29,190
but let me guarantee you something...

394
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:32,293
You had damn sure better not
be trying to show me up...

395
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,395
with any of your supercop bullshit.

396
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:36,030
Not at all, sir.

397
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:39,474
You got one week
of probation left, Mange...

398
00:41:40,778 --> 00:41:42,575
and I'm gonna be all over you.

399
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:48,585
Say "hello" to your new partner.

400
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:03,062
What's all that shit?

401
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,263
Supplies.
I want to be prepared for anything.

402
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:08,929
Of course you do.

403
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,248
Hey, pigs.

404
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:24,843
Why don't you get the hell outta here,
homes? This is our neighborhood.

405
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:51,040
You're just a regular bad-ass,
aren't you, Mange?

406
00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:00,623
Now, when did you fýrst notice
it was missing, sir?

407
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:02,257
This morning about 5:30.

408
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:06,456
I parked the tractor right here.
Now it's gone.

409
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:09,093
Is that your goat?

410
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:10,997
Yeah, that's Nellie.

411
00:43:14,872 --> 00:43:16,863
- She's in heat, huh?
- Yeah.

412
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:19,671
That's why I got her separated
from the other animals.

413
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:22,209
They can't resist her.

414
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,645
Makes sense.

415
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:27,107
Makes a lot of sense.

416
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:29,049
Mange, shut up.

417
00:43:29,086 --> 00:43:31,646
- Now, are these tracks still fresh?
- They are.

418
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:35,052
Walk me through the whereabouts of all
your farmhands at the time of the crime.

419
00:43:35,126 --> 00:43:38,323
I'm gonna check out
something over here.

420
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,706
How's it goin'?

421
00:43:58,382 --> 00:43:59,542
My name's Marvin.

422
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:04,715
You got it goin' on.

423
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:14,728
Gears? All of'em.

424
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:18,993
Have you noticed anything abnormal
in the area of late?

425
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:30,213
Control, Marvin.

426
00:44:30,247 --> 00:44:31,612
Control.

427
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:41,118
Sweetie.
Yes, you make me laugh.

428
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:47,763
That's not your property?

429
00:44:59,643 --> 00:45:00,610
So soft.

430
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:07,276
I'm gonna fýnd this man...

431
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:16,326
Oh, my! Watch this, Mange.

432
00:45:16,394 --> 00:45:18,760
The professor is in.

433
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:21,521
Take out your pen and take notes.

434
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:25,033
Hey, guys.

435
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:27,093
Ma'am...

436
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:31,130
now, I really oughta be givin' you
a ticket for bein' too darn cute.

437
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:33,306
But I'll tell you what.

438
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:36,541
I'll settle for taking you out
for a drink on Saturday night.

439
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:39,344
- What do you say?
- Maybe another time.

440
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:42,142
I already have a date...

441
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:45,181
with Marvin.

442
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:48,685
Right, Marvin?

443
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:55,826
Yeah. I forgot.

444
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:59,468
I'm picking her up at 8:00?

445
00:46:01,505 --> 00:46:04,235
Dinner and a walk.

446
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:07,607
I'll see you then.

447
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,514
A walk. I got an idea.

448
00:46:11,582 --> 00:46:13,641
Why don't I take you for a walk
down to the women's store...

449
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:16,676
so I can get you a blouse to
go along with the meter maid outfýt...

450
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,780
you're gonna be wearing from now on,
'cause that's your new job!

451
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:21,688
Get in the car!

452
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:25,455
Now, this is the mayor's
annual charity event.

453
00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:28,327
I want you to keep a low profýle.
Got it?

454
00:46:28,399 --> 00:46:30,594
- Got it.
- How are my teeth?

455
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:33,534
- Great.
- Good.

456
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:48,379
That's far enough, shit stains.

457
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:51,616
I don't want you anywhere near
the mayor or his guests. You got me?

458
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:53,554
I'll be a good boy.

459
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:56,583
And for God's sake,
keep your shirt on.

460
00:47:06,103 --> 00:47:08,298
I would like to thank
everyone here...

461
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:10,533
for the success of this fund-raiser.

462
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:13,736
The fýre department is
going to love their new equipment.

463
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:17,770
- Outstanding!
- Hi, Daddy.

464
00:47:17,815 --> 00:47:19,783
Hi, sweetheart.

465
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:23,914
Where are you off to?
You keep an eye on him.

466
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:27,557
- Yes, sir.
- That is one handsome little fellow.

467
00:47:28,526 --> 00:47:30,585
Bacon-wrapped shrimp?

468
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:36,389
Oh, thank you.

469
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:40,331
Hey, there he is.
How are you?

470
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:15,638
I am so sorry, Mr. Mayor.

471
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:17,674
Aren't you that drug-sniffýng cop?

472
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:19,232
Yes, sir.

473
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:33,448
It's a fur ball.

474
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,256
Sir, this offýcer's been on probation.
He obviously failed.

475
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:38,852
He's off the force as of now.

476
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:44,494
Do you hear that?

477
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:23,303
You all right?
You know, you scared your old man.

478
00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:33,710
Wonderful!

479
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,459
Chief, this is one fýne cop
you've got here.

480
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:54,868
Yes, it is.

481
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:08,781
Yeah.

482
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,982
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey, listen up! A toast!

483
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:15,583
To the newest cop
on the force, baby!

484
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:18,727
Go, Aquaman!

485
00:50:20,664 --> 00:50:22,359
- Outstanding!
- You're all right, man.

486
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,867
- You're all right.
- Right there. Go.

487
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:26,960
So you were really able to hear
that kid drowning from that far away?

488
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:28,732
- Yeah.
- All right.

489
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:31,036
Then what am I sayin' now?

490
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:35,938
You were born
with only one testicle.

491
00:50:37,748 --> 00:50:39,909
You keep that shit to yourself.

492
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:44,582
I'm just worried about my date
with the tree girl.

493
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:46,088
I don't know
if it's gonna work out.

494
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:47,756
She's a man, isn't she?

495
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,551
I knew it when you met her
in the men's room.

496
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:54,829
I have to tell you guys something.

497
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:57,833
I got into a terrible car crash
in the mountains.

498
00:50:57,901 --> 00:51:01,735
Some scientist found me and put me back
together with different animal parts.

499
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:04,603
Now I can't control
my sexual urges.

500
00:51:05,743 --> 00:51:09,770
If you don't wanna hang out with me
because I'm black, just let me know.

501
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:10,814
Yeah.

502
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,008
I hope you like vegetarian.

503
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:49,943
I love it.

504
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,113
Look at her.

505
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:55,682
And look at the disaster she's with.

506
00:51:55,726 --> 00:51:58,593
They make it so easy for us.

507
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:07,462
Thanks for helping me out
with Sergeant Sisk.

508
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:09,904
No, it was no problem.

509
00:52:12,075 --> 00:52:14,100
I wasn't sure
if you really meant it.

510
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:16,009
Of course I did.

511
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,570
Yeah?

512
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:28,414
So, how are the animals
doing over at the shelter?

513
00:52:29,493 --> 00:52:31,825
I started feeling bad
about the lack of space...

514
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:34,728
so I started to bring
some of the animals home with me.

515
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:36,060
Maybe I'm crazy.

516
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:40,195
I don't think so.
I think you're pretty amazing.

517
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:44,002
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

518
00:52:50,447 --> 00:52:52,540
You know, there's something
about you, Marvin.

519
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:54,049
I cannot fýgure it out.

520
00:52:56,653 --> 00:52:58,450
How is your grilled eggplant?

521
00:52:59,523 --> 00:53:02,492
- Nice, huh?
- Yes, it's lovely. Thank you.

522
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,049
You are the lovely one.

523
00:53:08,565 --> 00:53:10,089
- Where's the bathroom?
- Next to the bar.

524
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:12,693
Great. Thank you.
Excuse me for a second.

525
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:45,927
Do you smell that?

526
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,694
It's kind of musty.

527
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:52,800
Asparagus, next table.

528
00:53:57,814 --> 00:53:59,645
Oh, you have a little...

529
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:01,776
- Oh.
- I'll get it.

530
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:16,731
That was either the nicest thing
that's ever happened to me...

531
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,098
or the grossest.

532
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,314
- Will you excuse me for a minute?
- Of course.

533
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:56,100
- Sorry.
- I ordered us some sorbet.

534
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:57,697
Great.

535
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:09,575
Will you excuse me again, please?

536
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:24,299
There you go.

537
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:25,767
Oh, thank you.

538
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:30,364
Wow. That's such a beautiful
necklace you have.

539
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:32,898
- Thanks.
- Did you get that in Italy?

540
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:35,342
- Yes, in Florence.
- I am from Firenze. 

541
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:43,749
My family lives there. You stay
with them. I'll give you my number.

542
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:49,086
Call me.

543
00:55:52,863 --> 00:55:55,764
Tony, I'm gonna have a smoke.

544
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:14,950
What ever happened to that waiter?

545
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:17,316
I guess he was done
with his shift or something.

546
00:56:17,387 --> 00:56:19,014
Thanks for the walk.

547
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:21,319
No. Thank you for dinner.
It was great.

548
00:56:24,127 --> 00:56:27,290
So, can I invite you in?

549
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:32,092
It's been such a perfect evening.

550
00:56:32,169 --> 00:56:34,137
I'd hate to ruin it
by attacking you.

551
00:56:35,138 --> 00:56:37,072
Well, that's honest.

552
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:41,473
So, I guess this is good night.

553
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:53,747
Good night.

554
00:56:58,028 --> 00:57:02,158
Tomorrow, we're releasing Molly
the turkey vulture back into the wild.

555
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,865
You should come by.

556
00:57:04,935 --> 00:57:07,130
I wouldn't miss it.

557
00:57:07,204 --> 00:57:09,104
Okay. Good night.

558
00:58:02,225 --> 00:58:04,853
I've never seen anything like it.

559
00:58:06,496 --> 00:58:09,954
There was blood, guts everywhere.

560
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:15,367
There was nothin' left of that cow!

561
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,074
It even ate most of the hooves.

562
00:58:20,477 --> 00:58:25,540
I'm tellin' you, chief,
there's some kind of a beast out there.

563
00:58:25,782 --> 00:58:30,378
All the other cows
are too afraid to eat or shit.

564
00:58:30,453 --> 00:58:33,183
And they ain't got nothin' else.

565
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:38,121
I'm gonna have an offýcer
drive you home, you hear?

566
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:41,130
All I want you to do is
just take care of your cows.

567
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:45,594
I'm gonna go put on
a puppet show for 'em.

568
00:58:45,836 --> 00:58:48,327
- Maybe that'll calm 'em down.
- Marvin.

569
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:51,397
Can I see you
in my offýce for a minute?

570
00:58:52,976 --> 00:58:54,876
That was Bob Harris.

571
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:57,937
Last night a couple of his cows
got all torn up.

572
00:58:58,014 --> 00:59:01,848
Looks to me like it might be
one of those satanic rituals.

573
00:59:03,954 --> 00:59:07,481
Do you worship the dark lord?

574
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:10,390
No, sir.

575
00:59:18,435 --> 00:59:20,630
Help yourself.

576
00:59:25,308 --> 00:59:29,369
Bob got a look at a man
running away from the scene.

577
00:59:29,446 --> 00:59:31,505
We made a composite...

578
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:34,379
from his description.

579
00:59:42,192 --> 00:59:43,591
Do you recall...

580
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:48,393
where you were last night
between midnight and 5:00 a.m.?

581
00:59:48,465 --> 00:59:51,059
I was sleeping, sir.

582
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:53,466
Do you have...

583
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:55,494
anyone who can corroborate that?

584
00:59:55,538 --> 00:59:57,870
No, sir.

585
00:59:57,941 --> 01:00:01,035
Can you explain why that drawing...

586
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:04,012
Iooks like you, Marvin?

587
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:12,616
I'm going to have to ask you to go
on paid leave until we fýgure this out.

588
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:19,026
I'm also going to have to ask you
to teach me how you do that.

589
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:34,675
Sorry, Dad.

590
01:01:05,108 --> 01:01:06,939
Is that a beaver dam?

591
01:01:21,057 --> 01:01:22,718
What's happening to you?

592
01:01:25,495 --> 01:01:28,157
Look, you have to go.

593
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,965
You can trust me.

594
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,403
Only an animal would
do something like that.

595
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:45,107
There must be
some other explanation.

596
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:57,022
I know you, and you wouldn't
hurt anyone or anything.

597
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:03,424
It's getting late.

598
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,333
You can't stay here much longer.

599
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:08,337
I'm not going anywhere.

600
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:15,174
You're not dangerous...

601
01:02:15,245 --> 01:02:18,476
and I'm gonna stay here tonight
to prove it to you.

602
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:31,159
It's not safe.

603
01:02:31,227 --> 01:02:34,594
At night, I lose control.

604
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:43,669
What are you doing?

605
01:02:45,442 --> 01:02:47,376
I have no idea.

606
01:03:00,123 --> 01:03:02,114
Knock it off.

607
01:03:09,732 --> 01:03:13,759
If you're gonna stay here,
at least tie me up.

608
01:03:13,837 --> 01:03:14,826
What?

609
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:21,407
I want you to tie me up...

610
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,814
so that I won't hurt anybody.

611
01:04:02,785 --> 01:04:04,309
My handcuffs!

612
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:08,590
You looked so uncomfortable.

613
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:11,183
When did you take them off?

614
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:12,853
I don't remember.

615
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:15,762
You wore them for a while...

616
01:04:15,832 --> 01:04:18,198
and then I wore them for a while.

617
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:21,432
You are an animal.

618
01:04:21,504 --> 01:04:24,439
I am? Awesome!

619
01:04:30,647 --> 01:04:32,478
Marvin, go!

620
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:35,746
This is Chief Wilson.
Last night, a hunter was attacked!

621
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:39,448
Mange! We know about the barn!

622
01:04:39,522 --> 01:04:43,322
Marvin, you gotta get outta here!
Marvin, get out!

623
01:04:43,393 --> 01:04:45,918
- The freak show's over. Come with me!
- Go!

624
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:49,296
Freeze!

625
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:15,452
Supercop Marvin Mange
has turned fugitive today. 

626
01:05:15,491 --> 01:05:20,622
He's wanted for the assault of a bird
hunter, and the attack of two cows. 

627
01:05:20,663 --> 01:05:23,257
The suspect is considered
dangerous... 

628
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,733
and Elkerton Police Chief
Marion Wilson is assembling... 

629
01:05:25,802 --> 01:05:28,464
a task force
of the city's finest officers. 

630
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:30,672
Ladies and gentlemen...

631
01:05:32,308 --> 01:05:34,868
our suspect is not human.

632
01:05:36,346 --> 01:05:37,813
He is at home in the bush.

633
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:40,940
Shoot to kill.

634
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:45,620
Any questions?

635
01:05:45,688 --> 01:05:49,351
Yeah, I got a question there.
When do we get to light our torches?

636
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:52,485
- When it gets dark.
- I see.

637
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:55,487
I got another question there.

638
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:57,465
Suppose, hypothetically, you know...

639
01:05:57,533 --> 01:06:00,400
a guy had already lit his torch.

640
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:04,907
It'd be cool if he could just
keep it lit, huh?

641
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:06,635
Yes.

642
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:09,405
Oh, excellent. Excellent.

643
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:10,969
Now, if there are
no more questions...

644
01:06:11,047 --> 01:06:14,278
I got another question.

645
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:17,717
If one part of the mob gets separated
from another part of the mob...

646
01:06:17,754 --> 01:06:20,245
shouldn't there be a place
that we can get together?

647
01:06:20,323 --> 01:06:24,692
Maybe a secret place the two mobs could
reunite, and we'd be a big mob again.

648
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:27,924
- Stay with the mob.
- Stay with the mob. All right.

649
01:06:27,997 --> 01:06:30,932
- Right.
- Hey! I got another question.

650
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:34,963
Doesn't this guy deserve
a fair trial?

651
01:06:35,038 --> 01:06:36,528
You... back of the mob.

652
01:06:36,606 --> 01:06:39,803
"Back of the mob"? What?
This is my spot! I came early!

653
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:41,810
Okay, out of the mob!

654
01:06:41,878 --> 01:06:44,472
Ah, this mob blows.

655
01:06:45,415 --> 01:06:46,473
Let's go.

656
01:07:11,941 --> 01:07:14,774
- What are you doing out here?
- Picking apples.

657
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,604
With a dart gun?

658
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:22,643
I made a terrible mistake...

659
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:25,085
and now I must correct it.

660
01:07:26,556 --> 01:07:29,491
There's something else out here,
isn't there?

661
01:07:30,126 --> 01:07:33,926
It was the same
experimental procedure as yours.

662
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:37,396
I don't understand
what went wrong.

663
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:40,402
We have to catch it
before it's too late.

664
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:42,938
Until then...

665
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:46,738
we are all in danger.

666
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:51,637
Right here is exactly why
black people don't go camping.

667
01:07:51,714 --> 01:07:54,410
I could just as easily have something
crawl up my ass at home.

668
01:07:56,753 --> 01:07:58,550
I have to eat.

669
01:07:58,621 --> 01:08:02,113
You need to start carrying Power Bars
with you, 'cause this is some bullshit.

670
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:04,583
Sorry, Miles.

671
01:08:09,031 --> 01:08:10,692
I have to eat.

672
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,974
Oh, my God.
You scared me.

673
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:23,170
You shouldn't be out here.

674
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:26,541
There's a crazy man-beast
in the woods.

675
01:08:31,654 --> 01:08:32,712
Damn.

676
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:35,053
Go. Go!

677
01:08:35,124 --> 01:08:38,025
You're the only one
that can stop it now.

678
01:08:48,671 --> 01:08:51,105
On your left, on your left!

679
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:36,612
I love berries.

680
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:40,516
Are you done yet?

681
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:50,999
You're mine!
Like that, huh?

682
01:09:51,067 --> 01:09:53,001
Come on, baby.
Mange!

683
01:10:06,482 --> 01:10:08,074
What?

684
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:52,149
Come on. I got ya.

685
01:11:57,059 --> 01:11:58,356
Reach for it.

686
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:22,184
Why did you save me?

687
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:24,219
Like I told you...

688
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:27,255
I'm not an animal.

689
01:12:40,369 --> 01:12:42,337
Wish I could take that chance.

690
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:03,386
You.

691
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:14,859
That hunter was after my turkey vulture.
I had to scare him off.

692
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:18,969
I guess we have the same doctor.

693
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:25,469
I hope this doesn't
change anything between us.

694
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:32,981
So that's why you have six nipples.

695
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:39,821
The damn tree girl is the beast.

696
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:57,470
Two beasts kissing...

697
01:13:57,713 --> 01:13:59,203
that's hot.

698
01:14:05,855 --> 01:14:08,483
- Kill the beast! Kill him!
- Kill him!

699
01:14:09,925 --> 01:14:12,189
Take your dirty paws off her!

700
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:16,794
It's time to die, man-beast!

701
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:24,530
You can do it!
Cut his freaking balls off.

702
01:14:24,774 --> 01:14:26,139
I'm not a beast!

703
01:14:28,778 --> 01:14:31,474
- I'm not a beast!
- Then who is the beast?

704
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:33,412
Kill the beast!

705
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:38,386
All right, all right!

706
01:14:39,388 --> 01:14:41,151
It's me!

707
01:14:42,224 --> 01:14:45,091
I was not expecting that.
Were you?

708
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:47,061
I am the beast.

709
01:14:47,997 --> 01:14:53,526
I ate the cow, and I mauled the hunter.
So, do what you gotta do.

710
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:02,342
Well, I guess we can
let it go this time.

711
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:05,770
- Yeah, it's no big deal.
- What?

712
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:09,316
I'm won't be part of a mob
to kill a black guy, I'll tell ya that.

713
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:12,485
Let's move it out, people.
It's all over.

714
01:15:15,024 --> 01:15:16,491
These pantyhose are killing me.

715
01:15:16,559 --> 01:15:19,392
Come on.
Come on, all of you.

716
01:15:22,798 --> 01:15:25,266
"Let's let the black beast go free
just 'cause he's black!

717
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:28,132
We can't kill the black man-beast.
That would be racist."

718
01:15:28,204 --> 01:15:30,138
Way to go, buddy.

719
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:33,973
What is the matter
with you people?

720
01:15:39,548 --> 01:15:41,914
Come on, guys!
Time for dinner!

721
01:15:53,462 --> 01:15:57,831
I wonder who
they're gonna take after.

722
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,994
I got a feeling they're probably gonna
take after their dad.

723
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:03,265
Yeah? It could fall out.

724
01:16:04,306 --> 01:16:08,140
Thank you dearly
for this most prestigious award. 

725
01:16:08,177 --> 01:16:10,145
Winning this Nobel Prize... 

726
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:13,148
truly validates
a lifetime of hard work. 

727
01:16:13,215 --> 01:16:16,514
But I really owe it all
to one special person. 

728
01:16:16,585 --> 01:16:18,985
And that person... 

729
01:16:19,054 --> 01:16:21,386
is my fiancée, Yolanda. 

730
01:16:22,491 --> 01:16:24,152
It's the Badger Milk girl.

731
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:34,101
I guess there really is
someone for everybody...

732
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:36,660
even if you have to make 'em
out of animal parts.

733
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,101
You think so?

734
01:16:49,118 --> 01:16:51,643
What?
What? I'm just lookin'.

735
01:23:03,992 --> 01:23:06,324
That's a huge bitch! 

736
01:23:07,462 --> 01:23:09,953
Okay. Send those back!
