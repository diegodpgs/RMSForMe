1
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,693
Help me: Don't let me die
like a dog on this road:

2
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,095
Don't let me die:

3
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:15,633
I'll become a monk:
I'll become a monk:

4
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:18,329
I'll give myself to God:
I'll give myself to God:

5
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,066
I'll give myself to You:
I'll give myself to You:

6
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,937
Just spare me: Spare me:

7
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,670
Just help me:

8
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,987
Your father's here.

9
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,896
He's brought
the whole family.

10
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,014
He's leaving.

11
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,420
Father, please stay for supper:
Father:

12
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,581
Your first Mass,
and you crap yourself:

13
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,919
I hoped we could talk.

14
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,822
We scraped to send you
to the law,

15
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:30,191
to elevate you
to a noble profession.

16
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:32,696
I sweat in the mines for 20 years

17
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,995
to give you the chance
I never had:

18
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,126
Is that how you
interpret the commandment

19
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,068
to honor your father and mother?

20
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,106
- God brought me here.
- God?

21
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:43,607
A shaft of lightning
burns your arse,

22
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,075
and you call that God?

23
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,907
The devil, more like:

24
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,236
Father:

25
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,543
Shut up: Shut up:
Leave me alone:

26
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,676
Satan, stifle your lying tongue:

27
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,720
I never claimed to be good:
Never:

28
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,052
They know my faults here...
my pride, my cursed lust:

29
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:00,114
I confess them all:
I confess them all:

30
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,319
Just leave me:
Just leave me:

31
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,521
Just leave me:
Please leave me:

32
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,361
You're too hard on yourself,
Brother Martin.

33
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,664
Arguing with the devil
never does any of us any good.

34
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:13,261
He has had 5,000 years
of practice.

35
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,603
He knows all the weak spots.

36
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:18,006
I'm sorry about today.

37
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,545
I'm not here to scold you, Martin.

38
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,673
I'm too full of sin
to be a priest.

39
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,584
You know, in two years

40
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,527
I've never heard you confess
anything remotely interesting.

41
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,130
I live in terror of judgment.

42
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,034
And you think
self-hatred will save you?

43
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,904
Have you ever dared to think
that God is not just?

44
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:52,137
He has us born tainted by sin,

45
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:56,011
then He's angry with us
all our lives for our faults,

46
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,675
this righteous Judge...

47
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,183
who damns us...

48
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,621
threatening us
with the fires of hell:

49
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,652
I know: I know
I'm evil to think it:

50
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,890
You're not evil.

51
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,865
You're just not honest.

52
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,731
God isn't angry with you.

53
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:20,237
You are angry with God.

54
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,831
I wish there were no God.

55
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,103
Martin, what is it you seek?

56
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:27,168
A merciful God:

57
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:30,672
A God whom I can love.

58
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:33,411
A God who loves me.

59
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,981
Then look to Christ.

60
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,424
Bind yourself to Christ

61
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,358
and you will know God's love.

62
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:49,132
Say to Him,
"I'm yours. Save me."

63
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:55,535
"I am yours. Save me."

64
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,745
I am yours. Save me.

65
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,308
I am yours. Save me.

66
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:10,087
The brothers
are not happy with your decision.

67
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:11,884
They think there are
others in our cloister

68
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:14,448
better suited to deliver
your letters to Rome.

69
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:18,292
Martin has two degrees
and an aptitude for law.

70
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,525
It will be
a legal brief he carries.

71
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,296
Besides, it will do him good
to be out in the world.

72
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,771
We need your teaching, brother:

73
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,038
Try some wine.

74
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:14,279
Let go of me:
Let me go:

75
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,253
You listen, you little thief:

76
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:18,721
Keep going.
It's none of your business.

77
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,656
Keep going, for your good.

78
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:36,497
Hey, you look lonely, brother.

79
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:40,238
Alms for a blind man:

80
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,139
- Come on, come inside.
- No.

81
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,208
Statues of all
your favorite saints.

82
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,186
Saint Cecilia for sore throats,

83
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:52,746
Saint Paul for bad backs
and swollen feet, brother.

84
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,157
Saint Joe for chapped hands,
the Mirgin...

85
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,888
Pope Julius is coming:

86
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:58,952
Get down:

87
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:03,128
- Down:
- The Pope is here:

88
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,636
- It's the Holy Father:
- Clear the streets:

89
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:09,572
Make way for the Pope:
Make way for the Pope:

90
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:20,049
This way
for Saint John the Baptist's head:

91
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:25,178
Move along.

92
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,682
Move along, there.
Move along from the Baptist's head.

93
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,344
Give generously:

94
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,288
Good enough, brother.

95
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,517
Fast or slow,
you'll get your 500 years.

96
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:01,889
Enough:

97
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,404
Name of the deceased
and relation?

98
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,100
Hendrick Luther.

99
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,335
Grandfather.

100
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,810
An Our Father
on every step.

101
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:21,175
When you reach the top of the stairs,

102
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:24,215
Hendrick will be released from Purgatory
and into the gates of Heaven.

103
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,675
Name of the deceased
and relation?

104
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,778
Wolfram Eschen, uncle.

105
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,618
An Our Father on every step.

106
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,782
When you reach the top of the stairs,

107
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,452
Wolfram will be released from Purgatory
and into the gates of Heaven.

108
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,727
You are back from Rome
almost two weeks.

109
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:26,829
Two weeks, and scarcely alert,
even in the confessional.

110
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,003
As your father in Christ,
I order you to speak.

111
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,841
Rome is a circus...

112
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,946
a running sewer.

113
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,252
You can buy anything...
sex, salvation.

114
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,953
They have brothels
just for clerics.

115
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,689
As they probably do
in Leipzig.

116
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,497
One church had the coins
for which Judas sold our Lord.

117
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:01,528
100 years off Purgatory
for kissing each one.

118
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:04,598
And you think Rome unique
in such relics?

119
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:07,236
There are even rumors
about the Holy Father himself,

120
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:09,246
that he has a lust for power:

121
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:11,579
Let's go outside.

122
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,083
What's wrong with here?

123
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:15,244
Well, this floor... the color.

124
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,756
I like color, but you give
your brothers a hard choice...

125
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,156
they either learn
to scrub like you,

126
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:25,492
or find a way to make your patch
a little less sparkling.

127
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,728
Gently,

128
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:34,897
like milking a cow.

129
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:38,204
The ancients
reverenced their bees.

130
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:41,109
They valued them
more than slaves.

131
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:47,216
Have you ever read
the New Testament, Martin?

132
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:48,912
No, Father.

133
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:51,979
Not many have,
but in Wittenberg you will.

134
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,425
Wittenberg?

135
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,156
A doctorate in theology.

136
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:02,395
You're sending me away
to study?

137
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,128
I'm sending you to the source...

138
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,760
the Scriptures.

139
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:07,464
Christ Himself.

140
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,100
Here I'm losing my faith,

141
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,668
feeling like a fool even to pray,
and you're sending me away?

142
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,840
- You'll preach.
- I'd be a fraud as a preacher:

143
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,749
We preach best
what we need to learn most.

144
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,015
Do not send me away from you.

145
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,182
God gave you gifts for a purpose.

146
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:30,957
In Wittenberg, you will be
able to change minds, open eyes.

147
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,361
That's what you want,
isn't it?

148
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,466
To change things?

149
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,197
Welcome to Wittenberg,
Father Martin.

150
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,174
I am Ulrick Wender.
I'll be helping you in the parish.

151
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:47,609
Gunter and I have caught some fish
for your first meal among us.

152
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,203
Wender. That's a Dutch name.

153
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,839
I was born in Utrecht.

154
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,623
We have to stop for Hanna.

155
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:06,721
She's a little... well, she keeps
a child hidden in the forest.

156
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,732
A child living in the forest?

157
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,926
A crippled child.

158
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,333
If we don't buy the wood,
the little thing doesn't get fed.

159
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:15,966
Wood, brother?

160
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,235
Half or full bundle?

161
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,038
As much as this will buy.

162
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,876
This is our new priest,
Father Martin.

163
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,882
Hello, Hanna.

164
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,175
Thank you, Hanna.

165
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,221
Otto:

166
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,699
Good morning, Otto:

167
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:46,362
This is our new preacher,
Father Martin.

168
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,067
Father.

169
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,199
I look forward
to seeing you at Mass.

170
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,448
Good luck, there.

171
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,617
Get back to your work, Thomas:

172
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,054
You'd think I was a leper.

173
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,116
They thought you were
coming for a collection.

174
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,252
They thought I wanted their money?

175
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:12,159
No, they thought the Pope
wanted their money.

176
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,925
Every time
a new priest comes,

177
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,263
they have to pay Rome
for the privilege of sacraments.

178
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:21,335
Nulla salus extna ecclesiamm.

179
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,138
This debate has raged
for over 1,400 years,

180
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,644
from the earliest days
of the church,

181
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:30,078
but now
the Fifth Lateran Council

182
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:33,606
has reaffirmed
Saint Cyprian's famous dictum,

183
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,744
"Nulla salus extna ecclesiamm...

184
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,756
outside the Holy Roman church,
there is no salvation."

185
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:43,250
Professor Carlstadt.

186
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,319
What of the Greek Christians?

187
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,260
The Greek Christians?

188
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:54,961
Well, an early church document
clearly states

189
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,066
that a Roman bishop,
not a Greek,

190
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,008
was Saint Peter's successor.

191
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,477
And, of course,

192
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:05,073
it was Peter whom our Lord Christ
made His representative on earth.

193
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:10,247
So we must consider the saints
of the Greek church to be damned?

194
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,223
You miss the point.

195
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:17,022
But that is the inevitable
consequence of Cyprian's claim...

196
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:20,064
Greek Christians
are outside salvation.

197
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:24,090
Or is this claim based on
an over-literal reading

198
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,899
of Matthew 16:18...

199
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,669
"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock,
I will build my church."

200
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,643
Yet two lines earlier,
in verse 16,

201
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,579
we find the very foundation
of our faith...

202
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,412
"You are the Christ,
the Son of the living God."

203
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:43,443
Surely the more universal
we make these great words,

204
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,989
the nearer we come
to the mind of Christ.

205
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:49,390
You question the authority
of the church council, sir?

206
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,224
Not at all.

207
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,564
Though in 1215,
the Fourth Lateran Council

208
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,261
allowed that Cyprian
could be wrong

209
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:00,600
and salvation
could exist outside the church...

210
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,432
though not outside Christ.

211
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:17,285
Thomas: Thomas:

212
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,500
Why would he do such a thing?

213
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:42,545
If only we knew
what was in his head.

214
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:46,106
What does God say, Father,
for suicide?

215
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,887
I neven. Neven said
I lad tle answens.

216
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,650
I defy you, devil: You...

217
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,152
I know your handiwork:
You and your stinking lies:

218
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,098
Shaming... shaming...
shaming a mother,

219
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,261
telling her
to hide her broken child,

220
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,668
telling her boy to kill himself:

221
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,969
Brother Martin, the boy's damned:
I'm not allowed to do this:

222
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,373
The others won't rest
with him in here:

223
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,004
This is holy ground:
He's a suicide:

224
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,571
Tell Otto to bring his son:
Tell him:

225
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,788
Some people say that
according to God's justice,

226
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,090
this boy is damned
because he took his life.

227
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:35,599
I say it was overcome
by the devil.

228
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,837
Is this child
any more to blame

229
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,465
for the despair that overtook him

230
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,671
than an innocent man who is
murdered by a robber in the woods?

231
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:11,164
God must be mercy.

232
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:32,512
God is mercy.

233
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,354
He is yours. Save him.

234
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:59,376
Terrible. Unforgiving.
That's how I saw God.

235
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,519
Punishing us in this life,

236
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,319
committing us to Purgatory
after death,

237
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,850
sentencing sinners to burn in hell
for all eternity.

238
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,056
But I was wrong.

239
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:17,260
Those who see God as angry...

240
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,896
do not see Him rightly...

241
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,443
but look upon a curtain
as if a dark storm cloud

242
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,706
has been drawn across His face.

243
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:35,412
If we truly believe
that Christ is our Savior...

244
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,153
then we have a God of love,

245
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,454
and to see God in faith

246
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,290
is to look upon
His friendly heart.

247
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:50,634
So when the devil throws
your sins in your face

248
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,229
and declares that you deserve
death and hell, tell him this...

249
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:59,005
"I admit that I deserve
death and hell. What of it?

250
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:03,673
"For I know One who suffered
and made satisfaction in my behalf.

251
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,080
"His name is Jesus Christ,
Son of God.

252
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,415
Where He is,
there I shall be also."

253
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,141
Prince Frederick wants him silenced.

254
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,154
You should have stopped him,
Carlstadt. Forbidden him.

255
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,053
Forbidden him, Spalatin?

256
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,092
To teach theology?

257
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,854
He undermines the prince.

258
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,624
Come on, there is no
clear teaching on relics.

259
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,028
When I became a monk,

260
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:56,999
I believed the monk's cowl
would make me holy.

261
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,866
Was I an arrogant fool?

262
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,306
Now they have made me
a doctor of divinity,

263
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:07,902
and I'm tempted to believe
that this scholar's robe

264
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,640
will make me wise.

265
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:13,707
Well, God once spoke
through the mouth of an ass.

266
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,879
Perhaps he's about to
do so again.

267
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,788
But I'll tell you straight
what I think.

268
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:24,854
Who here has been to Rome?

269
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,463
Did you buy an indulgence?

270
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,830
No.

271
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,391
I did.

272
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:36,765
For a silver florin, I freed
my grandfather from Purgatory.

273
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:44,136
For twice that, I could have sprung
grandma and Uncle Marcus too,

274
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:47,241
but I didn't have the funds,
so they had to stay in the hot place.

275
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,479
As for myself,
the priests assured me

276
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,613
that by gazing at sacred relics,

277
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:54,021
I could cut down
my time in Purgatory.

278
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,788
Luckily for me, Rome had
enough nails from the Holy Cross

279
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:59,386
to shoe every horse in Saxony.

280
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,232
But there are relics
elsewhere in Christendom.

281
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:08,602
Eighteen out of twelve apostles
are buried in Spain.

282
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,608
And yet here in Wittenberg,

283
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,236
we have the pick of the crop...

284
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,075
bread from the Last Supper,

285
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,513
milk from the Mirgin's breast,

286
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,746
a thorn that pierced
Christ's brow on Calvary,

287
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:25,516
and 19,000 other bits
of sacred bone,

288
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,286
all authenticated sacred relics.

289
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,951
Even John Tetzel himself...

290
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,023
Inquisitor of Poland and Saxony,

291
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:38,796
seller of indulgences
extraordinary,

292
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:44,274
connoisseur of relics,
envies oun collection:

293
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,334
To possess them
for a single night,

294
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:52,145
he would willingly surrender
five years of his earthly life:

295
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,950
Or 500 years in Purgatory.

296
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,993
And now, good citizens
of Wittenberg,

297
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:14,664
Prince Frederick of Saxony
invites you here to his courtyard

298
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,970
to witness a mystery play

299
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:22,638
on that ever most popular
of subjects...

300
00:26:22,713 --> 00:26:26,513
the Day of Judgment.

301
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,195
Just like old times, Martin.

302
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,162
Excellency.

303
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:47,993
Secretary.

304
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:49,835
Prince's secretary.

305
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:53,434
Such secretaries have a habit
of becoming Excellencies.

306
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:57,208
Even when we were law students,
I had you marked for great things.

307
00:26:57,281 --> 00:27:00,216
I was hoping you may be
of some help in that regard.

308
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:03,651
Prince Frederick is
exceedingly proud of his relics.

309
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,390
Then I'm sorry
he didn't hear my lecture.

310
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,449
Perhaps I could have swayed him.

311
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,519
He spent 20 years
and a large fortune

312
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,224
building his collection,

313
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:16,630
that in a week's time,
on All Saints' Day,

314
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,999
thousands of faithful Christians
are coming to see.

315
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,061
Paying to see.

316
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,733
Contributions are
customary for indulgences,

317
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,242
along with confession

318
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,141
and true penitence.

319
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,544
Ah, yes.

320
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,209
The right prayers,
the right coins,

321
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:41,054
and 1,900,202 years
and 27 days less in Purgatory.

322
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,151
Do not bite the hand
that feeds you, Martin.

323
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:48,324
Our prince pays
for your chair in this university.

324
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,665
His relics pay for your chair.

325
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,906
And he who pays the piper...

326
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,335
calls the tune.

327
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:02,606
Do not embarrass him.

328
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,548
No one is more delighted
with your popularity here.

329
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,850
He'd prefer you stay.

330
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,259
Master Kranauer,

331
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:30,171
is Luther open to persuasion?

332
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,803
Not likely, my prince.
He's as bitable as...

333
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,573
As a donkey,
you were going to say?

334
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:36,738
Indeed, indeed.

335
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:45,752
I am conscious of the great honor
you do me, Cardinal Cajetan,

336
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:48,121
in recommending me
to His Holiness.

337
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:51,286
I doubt you'll think it an honor
20 years from now, Aleander.

338
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,490
My first master
was Pope Alexander MI.

339
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,324
Three mistresses,
five children,

340
00:28:58,402 --> 00:29:03,271
and a most fervent devotion
to bullfighting.

341
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,309
Pope Julius ll...

342
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,675
a month ago, he was
spiritual leader of the whole world.

343
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:10,475
Quite dignified-looking, isn't he?

344
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,039
But it's not
what Julius wanted.

345
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:15,745
He wanted to be
remembered as a warrior,

346
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,516
sitting on his horse,
sword in hand,

347
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,489
besieging the Menetians.

348
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,226
What is it you seek, Aleander?

349
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,491
To serve God.

350
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,231
To serve him with all my heart.

351
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,635
And that is
how you will be tempted.

352
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:35,327
Pope Leo X,
sovereign bishop of Rome,

353
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,957
successor to Saint Peter

354
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:39,901
and holy head
of the Roman Catholic church.

355
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,965
I've been longing for
someone to save Christendom.

356
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:49,812
Let us pray he's come.

357
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,342
Your reputation
precedes you, Aleander.

358
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,786
Then I am fearful.

359
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:01,585
Cardinal Cajetan says
you're a brilliant scholar,

360
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,923
yet possess
a fervent desire to serve.

361
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:06,519
I have need of such gifts.

362
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:08,690
Excellency.

363
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:12,202
Albert of Brandenburg wants
to be Archbishop of Mainz.

364
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:16,365
He's already archbishop
of two German territories.

365
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,429
Correct.

366
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,306
Then canon law disqualifies him
from holding a third.

367
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:25,645
Moreover, wasn't he underage
when granted his first post?

368
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:26,978
Just so.

369
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,881
Even as I myself was.

370
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,787
Doubtless Cajetan has informed you

371
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:36,054
that I was made cardinal
at the age of 13.

372
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,585
Albert's ambition
could still serve God's glory.

373
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,187
The Turks at the gates of Mienna.

374
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:44,030
The French are
yapping at my heels,

375
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:46,092
and Rome itself has
become an open sewer

376
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,298
filled with wild dogs
and cats by day

377
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:51,739
and brigands
and fornicators by night.

378
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,744
And this new
Basilica of Saint Peter's,

379
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,715
it's not just a building,
Aleander,

380
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:04,221
it's a symbol of my intent
to restore Christ's church.

381
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,854
And Albert could be
a minor blessing in that.

382
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,426
He offers 10,000 ducats
for Mainz.

383
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:16,693
But Albert is bankrupt.

384
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,132
You're well-informed.

385
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,101
The Fuggers will
lend him the money.

386
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,164
The imperial bankers?

387
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:27,143
An eight-year loan.

388
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,805
And how
would he repay them?

389
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,284
John Tetzel.

390
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:41,019
There, that's him:
Father John Tetzel:

391
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:47,125
Don't unfurl the banners
until the fire ignites.

392
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,565
Everything has been prepared
exactly as you instructed.

393
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:02,072
Welcome, Father Tetzel:

394
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,307
Come on, people:

395
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,179
Gather round:

396
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,634
Good people of Juterbog...

397
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:35,607
have you ever burned
your hand in the fire?

398
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,511
Even one finger
made raw by the flame

399
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,675
will torment you
throughout the night.

400
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:41,877
Is it not so?

401
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:43,613
Yes:

402
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:05,266
Imagine, then,
your entire body burning.

403
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,139
Not for one sleepless night...

404
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,305
not for a week,

405
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,110
but for all eternity:

406
00:34:12,182 --> 00:34:15,709
Are we to be spared
the fires of damnation

407
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:17,413
on the Judgment Day?

408
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:31,392
Tonight, your Pope,
the vicar of Christ, sends you a gift,

409
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:34,767
a gift to save you
from such fires,

410
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:38,069
a special indulgence granted

411
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,043
for the building
of Saint Peter's Church in Rome...

412
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:46,744
where the bones
of the apostles lie moldering,

413
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:49,251
exposed to wind and rain,

414
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,221
desecrated by wild animals.

415
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:56,851
Take heed the words
of your Holy Father who says,

416
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:59,862
"Lay a stone for Saint Peter's,

417
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,923
"and you lay the foundation
for your own salvation

418
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,593
and happiness in heaven."

419
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:09,605
How? With this indulgence.

420
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:12,335
When? Tonight,

421
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,900
and only tonight.

422
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,777
Seek the Lord while he is near.

423
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,907
Here is your raft.

424
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,849
Take hold:

425
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:46,074
In Heaven, there is
a treasure chest filled with merit.

426
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,141
Merit from Christ Jesus,

427
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,774
the Mirgin Mary, and the saints,

428
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,011
who, through their holy lives,

429
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:59,988
have merit to spare
for us poor sinners in need.

430
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:04,387
Tonight, that treasury
is open to you.

431
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,994
Do you not hear their voices,

432
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,296
the screaming voices?

433
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,801
Your deceased parents.

434
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,966
Grandparents.

435
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:22,173
Uncles, aunts screaming.

436
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,737
Beloved child.

437
00:36:26,316 --> 00:36:27,943
Beloved child.

438
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,950
Because, for a few coins,

439
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:35,549
you can rescue them
from their punishments and pain.

440
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:37,983
Listen.

441
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,996
Open your ears.

442
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:43,391
Father calling to son,

443
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,992
mother to daughter.

444
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,901
When a coin
in the coffer rings,

445
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:52,806
the soul
from Purgatory springs.

446
00:36:55,479 --> 00:37:00,246
God-fearing man,
do you have a coin for Christ?

447
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:01,875
Yes.

448
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,462
Gentle mother...

449
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,962
when the time comes,
make certain your crippled child

450
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,099
can run to Jesus.

451
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,406
These learned monks
are standing by

452
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,247
to write down your name

453
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,482
or the name of a loved one,
dead or alive, on this...

454
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:43,823
your passport to
the celestial joys of Paradise.

455
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,091
Name?

456
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,889
We can preach
until we're hoarse,

457
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:25,161
but if we cannot bring the Christ
of the Gospels to our people...

458
00:38:25,235 --> 00:38:27,226
...what do we offer them?
- Dr. Martin:

459
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:36,411
I did this for Grete.

460
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,844
Issued by
the Archbishop of Mainz.

461
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,226
Where did you get this?

462
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:55,163
Juterbog.
I bought it in the church.

463
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:59,234
It's just paper, Hanna.

464
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,261
These words mean...

465
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,605
nothing.

466
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,611
It's no good?

467
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,410
You must put your trust
in God's love.

468
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,074
Save your money

469
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,778
to feed Grete.

470
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,866
"To Albent of Mainz.

00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,161
Forward this to Rome.

479
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,640
"Christians are to be taught

485
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,854
My God, who is this Martin Luther?

486
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,796
- Fritz:
- What?

487
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,856
Dr. Luther wanted
everyone to see that:

488
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,595
And everyone will.

489
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,864
Good people of Magdeburg,

490
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,309
take hold of the raft
while you still can.

491
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:51,541
So much grace
for so little coin:

492
00:40:58,388 --> 00:41:00,356
German money
for the German church.

493
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,154
Does Saint Peter lie
in a German church?

494
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:05,490
- Or Saint Paul?
- We don't need your saints.

495
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:07,689
Or any of the holy apostles?

496
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:14,126
With this indulgence,
I can absolve any sin.

497
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:16,764
I can even save the soul of the man

498
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,968
who violates
the mother of God herself.

499
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:28,111
One-fifth of the usual take.

500
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,779
How will you
explain this to Rome?

501
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,287
Damn that heretic:

502
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:36,087
He will burn in hell.

503
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,650
This drunken little German monk

504
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,789
is intoxicated with himself.

505
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,531
Sober him.

506
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,179
Why was Prince Frederick
not apprised

507
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,979
of your letter
to Albert of Mainz?

508
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:04,476
Why?

509
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:06,249
I did not want him compromised.

510
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:09,758
Now our prince
can swear before God

511
00:42:09,826 --> 00:42:11,418
he had no knowledge
of my writings

512
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,360
or my criticism
of the Archbishop.

513
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,024
Criticism of the Archbishop?
What of your criticism of Rome?

514
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:18,431
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing this is

515
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,764
to Prince Frederick,

516
00:42:19,836 --> 00:42:21,269
his prize professor of theology

517
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,135
drawing condemnation
from the Pope?

518
00:42:23,206 --> 00:42:26,573
My criticism was not
of the Holy Father himself,

519
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:29,339
but of those rogues
who claim to represent him.

520
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:38,076
You have been summoned
to appear by Rome.

521
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,521
You are threatened
with excommunication.

522
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,957
But I'm a loyal son
of the church:

523
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:47,963
I don't believe the Pope
would issue such a summons.

524
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:49,896
Welcome to the world
of politics, Doctor.

525
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,562
Martin...

526
00:42:56,873 --> 00:42:58,306
Lay low.

527
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,570
Do not write
a single word to anyone

528
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,908
until I have a chance
to sort this out.

529
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:09,080
They've already published
my explanations of the 95 Tleses.

530
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:11,620
I dedicated it to Pope Leo.

531
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,157
Clearly, clearly
you've heard the rumors...

532
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:22,597
that the Pope has
summoned me to Augsburg.

533
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,826
Well, it's true.

534
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,805
It's true, and I pray fervently

535
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,999
he will find no fault with me.

536
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,136
But think on this
while I am gone.

537
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:42,640
We obsess...

538
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:45,677
over relics.

539
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,317
Indulgences.

540
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,484
Pilgrimages to holy places.

541
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:56,359
Yet all the time,
all the time, there is Christ.

542
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,561
Christ. Christ, here...

543
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,905
in every corner,

544
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,702
in every hour of the day.

545
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:08,870
He isn't found
in the bones of saints...

546
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,972
but here,
in your love for each other,

547
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:15,040
in your love for one another...

548
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:17,576
in His sacraments,

549
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:20,555
and in God's holy word.

550
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:26,062
If we, if we live the word,
by faith...

551
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,604
in love

552
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:38,869
and service to one another,

553
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,605
we need fear
no man's judgment.

554
00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:53,019
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

555
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:55,557
Martin, the faculty
stands behind you.

556
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,118
I have written a letter of protest,

557
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,561
and I'll be the first to sign
should they arrest you in Augsburg.

558
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,257
Thank you, Carlstadt.
Thank you.

559
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,206
Bless you. Bless you.

560
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:17,902
Father.

561
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,471
Are you in trouble?

562
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,985
What happens now?

563
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,820
I honestly don't know.

564
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,420
Well...

565
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:35,760
Father, thank you.

566
00:45:35,832 --> 00:45:37,595
Thank you, Father.

567
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,862
Just try to keep
your big mouth shut.

568
00:46:31,354 --> 00:46:32,844
Father.

569
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:35,891
She wants you to know
that she prays for you every night.

570
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:25,573
Father.

571
00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:30,968
Have I...?

572
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,749
Have I caused you trouble too?

573
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,652
I'm here
to get you through this.

574
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,416
They've stopped
Tetzel from preaching.

575
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,858
He's in Leipzig
under house arrest.

576
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:47,226
That's a good sign, isn't it?
That means that Rome must understand.

577
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,390
It just means he went too far.

578
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,362
Martin.

579
00:47:52,435 --> 00:47:53,925
Martin, listen to me.

580
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:56,096
Cardinal Cajetan
didn't bring you here

581
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:58,140
to teach him the Scriptures.

582
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,972
I beg you in God's name
to have a care.

583
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,375
Be temperate.

584
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:05,005
Don't talk, just listen.

585
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:08,050
Your life
could depend on it.

586
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,245
He's waiting for you.

587
00:48:41,484 --> 00:48:45,147
I am Girolamo Aleander,
representing Cardinal Cajetan.

588
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:50,456
Your meeting won't take long.
I'm here to prepare you for tonight.

589
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:53,584
Please.

590
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,154
Sit.

591
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:09,868
It was never my intention

592
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:16,351
to say anything against
the honor and the dignity

593
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:18,284
of our Holy Father.

594
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,057
Of course not, Brother Martin.

595
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,127
And that being the case,

596
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:28,255
that we all desire peace,

597
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:33,826
you only have to follow a few
simple rules of protocol.

598
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:36,905
When you meet the Cardinal,

599
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:39,908
you will throw yourself on the floor,
face to the ground.

600
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:43,207
The Cardinal will tell you to stand,
at which time you will kneel

601
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:46,544
and remain kneeling
throughout your hearing.

602
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:50,016
Do you understand?

603
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:51,417
Yes.

604
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,084
If the church takes exception
to a single point,

605
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,150
I will submit to her immediately.

606
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:02,255
But I'm sure when the Cardinal
and Pope Leo

607
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,663
understand my position...

608
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,235
they'll find no fault with me.

609
00:50:11,407 --> 00:50:13,466
We have a misunderstanding.

610
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,105
There will be no discussion.

611
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,342
No debate.

612
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:26,413
You have one word to say
and one word only.

613
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:28,752
Revoco...

614
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,793
I recant...

615
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,555
and the matter is over.

616
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,764
I think we do have
a misunderstanding.

617
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,461
I came to Augsburg
to warn the Pope

618
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,061
about the abuses
against the faithful

619
00:50:42,138 --> 00:50:43,969
by the indulgence preachers.

620
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,473
Have a care, Brother Martin.

621
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,305
It is the Pope who shall decide

622
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,572
what is or is not
beneficial to Christendom.

623
00:50:51,814 --> 00:50:55,750
This evening, one word.

624
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,043
Revoco.

625
00:51:02,825 --> 00:51:05,225
Thank you, Excellency.

626
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:14,264
Brother Martin...

627
00:51:17,006 --> 00:51:20,305
with your permission,
I'm going to arrange a bath for you.

628
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,173
Thank you, Excellency.

629
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,482
My son, I know you desire

630
00:51:33,556 --> 00:51:36,787
to be a faithful servant
of Christ and His church.

631
00:51:36,859 --> 00:51:38,451
I am here to help you.

632
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:43,798
Stand on your feet, my son.

633
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,205
What do you have to say?

634
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,174
Have I erred?

635
00:51:57,246 --> 00:52:00,272
Yes, you have erred.

636
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,715
How?

637
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,485
That I may avoid such error again.

638
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,650
You have erred
by teaching new doctrines.

639
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,718
Which of my teachings
is offensive to Rome?

640
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:14,194
For one, indulgences.

641
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:16,595
Pope Clement's decree,
Unigenitus.

642
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:19,601
clearly states that
the merits of Christ

643
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,830
are a treasure of indulgences.

644
00:52:21,904 --> 00:52:22,893
Acquire.

645
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:25,668
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

646
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,300
I think you'll find it says...

647
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:32,842
"The merits of Christ acquire
the treasure of indulgences."

648
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:36,083
I am not here
to wrangle with you.

649
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,141
No, Your Grace.

650
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:41,623
But Unigenitus was issued
175 years ago,

651
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,785
and were this decree
not so embarrassing to our church,

652
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:47,830
perhaps it would not be
commonly called Extnavagante

653
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:51,999
and left out of
most collections of canon law.

654
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:55,128
It contradicts Anommitanos.

655
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:58,640
Our present Pope Leo is
in harmony with Clement's decree...

656
00:52:59,742 --> 00:53:01,369
and there ends the matter.

657
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:04,038
The honor of the Papacy
is not preserved

658
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:06,343
by the naked assertion
of Papal authority,

659
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,249
but by safeguarding
the Pope's credibility

660
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:11,912
and the clear testimonies
of divine Scripture.

661
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,957
The Pope interprets Scripture.

662
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:16,821
He may interpret it...

663
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,553
but he is not above it.

664
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,723
He was to say one word.

665
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,960
We both know
the selling of indulgences

666
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:27,025
have no Scriptural support.

667
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,266
If common people could
read the Bible for themselves,

668
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:32,273
they would understand
just how broad

669
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:33,774
the church's interpretations are.

670
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:35,333
That is outrageous:

671
00:53:36,345 --> 00:53:38,176
The Scriptures are too complex

672
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:40,147
for even the average priest
to understand,

673
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,706
much less the common man:

674
00:53:41,784 --> 00:53:43,877
Indulgences are
an established tradition

675
00:53:43,953 --> 00:53:46,649
which give comfort to
millions of simple Christians.

676
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,453
Comfort? Your Grace,
I'm not interested in comfort.

677
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:50,992
Comfort is not the issue:

678
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,426
So you consider your discomfort

679
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:56,488
more important than
the survival of Christianity?

680
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,296
- I'm interested in the truth:
- The truth?

681
00:53:59,368 --> 00:54:02,235
The Turks are building armies
on our eastern borders.

682
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,068
We are on the brink of war.

683
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,735
To the west, lies a world of souls
who have never heard the name of Christ.

684
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,402
That is the truth:

685
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,777
Christianity is tearing apart,

686
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,578
and just when we need
unity most,

687
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,174
you create confusion:

688
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,743
My goal is not to quarrel
with the Pope or the church,

689
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:22,086
but to defend them
with more than mere opinion.

690
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,389
The Gospel cannot be denied
for the word of man.

691
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,932
I refuse to argue
with that monk.

692
00:54:32,368 --> 00:54:34,393
You said he was a simpleton.

693
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:37,530
He questioned
the Pope's authority.

694
00:54:38,674 --> 00:54:40,938
Anommitanos.

695
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,272
Unigenitus.

696
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:46,782
Or shall we call it Extnavagante
like the rest of the world?

697
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:48,339
He's a heretic.

698
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,249
Our orders were clear.

699
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:55,187
Either he recant...

700
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,251
Do not presume
to lecture me, Aleander.

701
00:54:59,328 --> 00:55:01,455
I know perfectly well
what our orders were.

702
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,629
I kept my temper and merely asked
to be shown the error of my ways.

703
00:55:06,702 --> 00:55:09,637
If you do not recant, you will be
delivered to the Inquisition.

704
00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:12,469
Will you recant?

705
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,465
What?

706
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:21,875
Then there is only one way
to save your life.

707
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:25,142
Kneel.

708
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,380
Kneel:

709
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:29,856
Martin Luther,

710
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:33,418
in the name of Christ,
I release you from your vows

711
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,054
to the Augustinian order

712
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:37,497
and commend you to God's mercy.

713
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,627
I'm no longer your father,
do you understand?

714
00:55:40,703 --> 00:55:43,103
Were I your father,
then under canon law,

715
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:46,266
I would be obligated to
deliver you to the authorities:

716
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:51,313
But I'll be
your spiritual father...

717
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,977
until the day I die.

718
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,719
Now go.

719
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,285
Go quickly:

720
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,392
There is a horse at the back gate.

721
00:56:11,467 --> 00:56:14,231
Don't leave me alone,
Father. Please.

722
00:56:14,303 --> 00:56:15,292
Father:

723
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,147
My pnince.

724
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:37,652
how shall I answer?

725
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:42,153
The Cardinal demands
that Luther be delivered to Rome

726
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:43,721
or banished from Saxony.

727
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,394
Have you read Luther's work?

728
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,434
Yes, all of it.

729
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:52,940
Yes. He's a brilliant
little monk, isn't he,

730
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,341
with an independent mind.

731
00:56:56,512 --> 00:56:58,070
Yes, he is.

732
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:02,514
Oh, Spalatin, you were
at law school with him, weren't you?

733
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,076
Did he show any inclination then

734
00:57:05,154 --> 00:57:10,524
of surrender to influence?

735
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,582
No.

736
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:15,597
After all, all he has done
is to debate, eloquently,

737
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,792
on a most interesting subject.

738
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,198
And, after all,

739
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:23,500
that is all one can ask
a good university professor to do.

740
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:27,807
So what shall we say
to the Cardinal?

741
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,083
Nothing.

742
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:39,087
My lord, we have to respond.

743
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,419
Spalatin, there are
two ways of saying no

744
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:44,288
to someone you believe to be
stronger than yourself.

745
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,420
The first is to say nothing

746
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:51,262
and go on merely doing
what you were doing before,

747
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,768
and pretend
that you never heard,

748
00:57:53,836 --> 00:57:59,775
allow time and inertia
to be your allies.

749
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,372
And the second?

750
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:08,179
And the second is to say no
in such a kind and thoughtful way

751
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,718
it befuddles them.

752
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:13,778
Naturally, if both
these strategies fail,

753
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:16,689
there is nothing but to relent.

754
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:20,725
Or to fight:

755
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:23,390
And of course,
if you decide to fight,

756
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:26,560
you also have to decide to win.

757
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,407
No, I'm not going to
send my monk to Rome.

758
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,069
They'll only kill him.

759
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,408
It's so irritating.

760
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,074
Who are they
to deprive my university

761
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,776
of such a fine mind?

762
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,983
Your little German monk
is still spewing filth at us.

763
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,183
He has a new cartoon circulating.

764
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,717
He calls you an ass
playing a harp, Cajetan.

765
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:59,924
The point, Your Holiness,
is that he does not write in Latin.

766
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:01,367
Luther writes in German.

767
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:03,337
That is his sword.

768
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,432
So he does not
play like a gentleman?

769
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:10,378
Ordinary Germans
can quote his work.

770
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,212
If we wait,
we might be too late.

771
00:59:14,283 --> 00:59:16,513
You exaggerate his importance.

772
00:59:16,585 --> 00:59:20,112
Besides, you told me yourself
you agree with his list of abuses.

773
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,180
Some of his concerns
have long been held

774
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:24,385
by those who love the church, yes.

775
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:27,486
I don't suppose your little monk

776
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:30,259
would be interested
in a cardinal's hat?

777
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:34,063
I think he would be
ashamed to wear it, Your Holiness.

778
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:37,867
We must put pressure
on Prince Frederick, Excellency.

779
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,430
Aleander is right.

780
00:59:39,508 --> 00:59:42,136
Frederick is our key to Luther.

781
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,546
Germany is on the brink of chaos,

782
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:47,445
and we don't want
to divide the church.

783
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:50,110
I grow tired of you
missing the big picture, Cajetan.

784
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:54,020
That's why I've sent Karl von Miltitz
to Germany in your stead.

785
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:24,049
My lord, greetings
from our most Holy Father.

786
01:00:25,354 --> 01:00:27,686
As for me, I am
especially honored to meet you,

787
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:31,817
as all of Christendom knows of
your steadfast devotion to the faith.

788
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,294
I have brought you a gift
from our Holy Father...

789
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:40,460
to express his highest esteem
for your lordship,

790
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,231
for, as you know, my lord,

791
01:00:42,304 --> 01:00:45,102
this most sacred rose
is consecrated annually

792
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,869
by Pope Leo himself,

793
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:49,035
and sent to just one
favored prince

794
01:00:49,111 --> 01:00:51,909
in recognition
of heroic loyalty and devotion

795
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,448
to Christ's holy church.

796
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:13,027
Spalatin, I'm sorry
for keeping you so late,

797
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,002
but this is a matter
of some urgency.

798
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:21,600
First of all,
give Miltitz 600 ducats

799
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:24,510
as an expression of our gratitude.

800
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,448
My lord, the rose
is hardly worth so much.

801
01:01:28,517 --> 01:01:30,212
Oh, I know that.

802
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:35,087
And then tell them that
we will not deliver Luther to Rome.

803
01:01:35,157 --> 01:01:37,648
And get that...
that rose...

804
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:40,889
Put it among the relics,

805
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:44,023
and while you're about it,
move all the relics out.

806
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:46,897
Move them to someplace
I don't even know where they are.

807
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,460
I don't want to know
where they are. I want...

808
01:01:49,538 --> 01:01:50,800
Go on.

809
01:01:55,544 --> 01:01:57,808
When I was a child,
I thought like a child,

810
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,314
I was a child,
I played like a child.

811
01:02:02,718 --> 01:02:06,313
And now, thanks to the adults,

812
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:10,449
I've had to join
the world of adults.

813
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:15,295
And I am appalled...

814
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:19,162
by how easy they thought it was

815
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,669
to bribe me:

816
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,611
Armed horsemen:

817
01:03:01,685 --> 01:03:03,619
Over there:

818
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,764
What is so important
that you interrupt us?

819
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,831
Prince Frederick of Saxony.

820
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:28,710
He refuses to surrender Luther
to you, Your Holiness.

821
01:03:31,181 --> 01:03:33,615
Go: Go, go:

822
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:41,452
Anise. O Lond.
and judge tly cause.

823
01:03:42,459 --> 01:03:45,189
A wild boan

Amen.

832
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,709
You can burn his books,
but you can't burn his ideas:

833
01:04:44,722 --> 01:04:47,520
Go back to Rome, you butchers:

834
01:04:47,591 --> 01:04:49,923
Go burn your own books:

835
01:04:49,994 --> 01:04:52,690
Go burn the Pope's books:

836
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:57,029
Papist devils:
Papist devils, leave us:

837
01:04:57,101 --> 01:05:00,093
By order of His Holiness,
Pope Leo X...

838
01:05:01,138 --> 01:05:03,368
the works of Martin Luther

839
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,102
shall be erased
from the memory of man:

840
01:05:06,176 --> 01:05:09,202
Martin Luther speaks the truth:

841
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:11,543
- Devils.
- Here, Father:

842
01:05:11,615 --> 01:05:13,742
Find someone else to do it:

843
01:05:23,227 --> 01:05:25,218
He belongs to us:

844
01:05:38,175 --> 01:05:43,613
This... is what Rome calls
a Papal Bull,

845
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,944
an edict from the Pope himself.

846
01:05:46,016 --> 01:05:49,884
There's only one thing to do
with this blast of wind.

847
01:05:51,188 --> 01:05:54,214
Yes: Feed the fire:
Feed the fire with canon law:

848
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:57,283
Feed the fire with every lie
ever written in Rome:

849
01:05:57,361 --> 01:05:59,795
- Come on, feed it:
- Feed the flames:

850
01:05:59,863 --> 01:06:01,387
Feed it:

851
01:06:01,465 --> 01:06:03,456
That's right, feed the flames:

852
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:08,130
Feed the flames:
Feed them:

853
01:06:11,308 --> 01:06:13,299
My Emperor.

854
01:06:13,377 --> 01:06:14,901
My good uncle.

855
01:06:14,978 --> 01:06:18,414
Allow me to extend
my congratulations on your elevation.

856
01:06:18,482 --> 01:06:21,645
I've come to speak to you
about Martin Luther.

857
01:06:21,718 --> 01:06:25,916
Our Holy Father has sent
his new cardinal to advise us.

858
01:06:25,989 --> 01:06:29,720
Oh: You mean you've
traveled all the way from Rome

859
01:06:29,793 --> 01:06:33,354
just in order to advise us
about this small matter?

860
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:38,265
Heresy is never
a small matter, my lord.

861
01:06:39,503 --> 01:06:42,870
Your Highness, if I might
for a moment have your ear.

862
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,808
- If your business is Martin Luther...
- My business is Saxony, sir...

863
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:50,973
...and I wish a brief audience
with my Emperor.

864
01:07:03,794 --> 01:07:06,160
- Deliver Luther to Rome.
- I cannot.

865
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:09,893
He's my subject. It's my duty to see
that he gets a fair hearing.

866
01:07:09,967 --> 01:07:11,491
Aleander has given me his word

867
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:14,401
that the Inquisition will
give Luther a proper hearing.

868
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:17,736
The Rome Inquisition
does not give hearings, my lord.

869
01:07:17,808 --> 01:07:20,208
It gives death sentences.

870
01:07:20,277 --> 01:07:24,680
And the whole of Germany
prays that you will defend her.

871
01:07:24,748 --> 01:07:26,716
The heretic must be tried.

872
01:07:27,818 --> 01:07:31,982
Your blessed grandfather
Maximilian

873
01:07:32,055 --> 01:07:34,546
told us that no German subject

874
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:38,220
would ever be condemned
without a fair trial

875
01:07:38,295 --> 01:07:41,264
in his own country.

876
01:07:46,703 --> 01:07:48,568
Then we shall hear him
in Germany.

877
01:07:49,773 --> 01:07:51,035
In Worms.

878
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:55,374
Worms is still a very long way
from Wittenberg, my lord,

879
01:07:55,445 --> 01:07:59,074
and the Pope himself has
put a bounty on Luther's head.

880
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:01,674
His spies are everywhere,

881
01:08:01,752 --> 01:08:04,550
in defiance of my humble rule,

882
01:08:04,621 --> 01:08:08,887
and therefore, sir,
in defiance of your greater rule.

883
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:12,224
Then I will ensure
Martin Luther's safe conduct

884
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,729
to a fair hearing.

885
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:17,233
I myself shall send you
an imperial guard to escort him.

886
01:08:18,468 --> 01:08:19,992
On that you have my word.

887
01:08:21,004 --> 01:08:22,494
Oh, yes.

888
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:36,085
Martin Luther is coming:

889
01:09:05,082 --> 01:09:07,175
Bless us, Father:
Please bless us:

890
01:09:30,874 --> 01:09:34,935
Help my family, please, Doctor:
Give us your blessing:

891
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:43,480
Don't kneel to me.
I'm no saint.

892
01:09:43,553 --> 01:09:45,817
Bless me, Father:
Bless me, Father:

893
01:09:45,889 --> 01:09:48,517
Father: Bless me, Father:

894
01:09:55,999 --> 01:09:57,899
I thought
you had abandoned me.

895
01:09:59,503 --> 01:10:01,596
I thought I was
alone again in this world.

896
01:10:01,672 --> 01:10:03,765
Be still, Martin.

897
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,104
One slip, and you'll
save the Emperor a trial.

898
01:10:07,678 --> 01:10:09,339
I'm here to serve you.

899
01:10:10,347 --> 01:10:12,372
I jest because I'm so afraid.

900
01:10:14,017 --> 01:10:18,784
Martin, I hoped
you'd help reform the church,

901
01:10:18,855 --> 01:10:20,254
not destroy it.

902
01:10:21,525 --> 01:10:26,121
With all its sins,
the church is still the church.

903
01:10:26,196 --> 01:10:29,461
What is a child
without its family?

904
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:33,798
How would people fare
left to themselves,

905
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:35,701
helpless and frightened?

906
01:10:40,377 --> 01:10:43,540
All my life, I have seen
a world that hates evil

907
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:45,342
more than it loves good.

908
01:10:49,152 --> 01:10:52,610
I beg you
to look to the good, Martin.

909
01:10:59,162 --> 01:11:01,926
You are tearing the world apart.

910
01:11:07,003 --> 01:11:09,597
That day when you
sent me out so boldly

911
01:11:09,673 --> 01:11:11,368
to change the world...

912
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:16,510
Did you really think
there wouldn't be a cost?

913
01:11:28,024 --> 01:11:31,357
It is simply a matter
of individual conscience.

914
01:11:41,238 --> 01:11:44,571
They'll burn him for sure.

915
01:12:09,933 --> 01:12:13,130
Do you, Martin Luther,
recognize these books?

916
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:17,469
Tle 95 Tleses. A Senmmon
on Indulgence and Gnace.

917
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:20,032
Tle Babylonian Captivity.

918
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:21,839
Fneedomm of a Clnistian.

919
01:12:21,912 --> 01:12:25,678
Addness to tle Clnistian Nobility
of tle Genmman Nation?

920
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,308
Are you the author?

921
01:12:34,124 --> 01:12:35,489
All are mine.

922
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:38,960
These books contain heresies
against our holy church.

923
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:42,396
Do you recant
what you've written?

924
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,505
I...

925
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:53,338
Please, God,
let him say the right thing.

926
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,469
- I was...
- Speak up.

927
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,344
May I have time to consider?

928
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,582
You have had the time,

929
01:13:06,656 --> 01:13:09,147
and you should have been
prepared to answer.

930
01:13:11,895 --> 01:13:14,261
I would like to answer
satisfactorily,

931
01:13:14,331 --> 01:13:17,164
without injury
to the divine word

932
01:13:17,234 --> 01:13:19,259
or danger to my soul.

933
01:13:19,336 --> 01:13:23,272
Any one of us might be
expected to bear witness,

934
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:26,434
unequivocally and fearlessly
at any time.

935
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:29,001
All the more in your case,

936
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:32,378
a famous, experienced
professor of theology.

937
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:48,056
We grant you one day.

938
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,133
Tomorrow you shall answer.

939
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,229
Damn you, go back to hell:

940
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:59,070
Damn you,
damn you, damn you:

941
01:13:59,142 --> 01:14:01,474
Damn you, go back to hell:

942
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,471
Shut up, shut up,
shut up:

943
01:14:05,549 --> 01:14:08,416
Shut up: I feel
your foul breath on my neck:

944
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:11,454
Happy devil you are,
to see me mute:

945
01:14:11,521 --> 01:14:16,788
Shaking... shaking
like an animal at the slaughter:

946
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,885
Oh, my, yes.
Well, where is his faith now?

947
01:14:18,962 --> 01:14:21,430
Where's his faith now?
Where's his boasting now?

948
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:23,398
Where's his boasting...?

949
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:32,775
I am yours. Save me.

950
01:14:34,177 --> 01:14:36,304
I am yours.

951
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,574
Save me.

952
01:14:40,183 --> 01:14:41,878
I am yours.

953
01:14:41,952 --> 01:14:43,476
Save me.

954
01:14:54,631 --> 01:14:56,599
Speak well, Doctor.
Good luck, Martin.

955
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,497
- Good luck.
- Good luck, Martin.

956
01:15:08,578 --> 01:15:11,547
- God be with you.
- I pray Thee do Thy will.

957
01:15:11,615 --> 01:15:14,277
Order in the hall.

958
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:16,342
Order:

959
01:15:17,821 --> 01:15:19,186
Order:

960
01:15:26,663 --> 01:15:31,123
Martin Luther, are you
the author of these writings?

961
01:15:32,202 --> 01:15:33,635
I am.

962
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:36,866
Do you recant
what you have written here?

963
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:43,509
I cannot renounce all of my works
because they are not all the same.

964
01:15:45,782 --> 01:15:47,443
First are those books in which

965
01:15:47,517 --> 01:15:52,045
I have described Christian faith
and life so simply that

966
01:15:52,122 --> 01:15:55,819
even my opponents have admitted
that these works are useful.

967
01:15:55,892 --> 01:15:59,487
To renounce these writings
would be unthinkable,

968
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:03,054
for that would be to renounce
accepted Christian truths.

969
01:16:03,133 --> 01:16:04,998
He is not here
to make speeches,

970
01:16:05,068 --> 01:16:06,865
only to answer.

971
01:16:06,936 --> 01:16:10,235
The second group of my work
is directed against the foul doctrine

972
01:16:10,306 --> 01:16:12,774
and evil living of the Popes,

973
01:16:12,842 --> 01:16:15,208
past and present.

974
01:16:15,278 --> 01:16:17,007
- No:
- Yes:

975
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,983
Through the laws of the Pope
and the doctrines of men,

976
01:16:22,052 --> 01:16:26,352
the consciences of the faithful have
been miserably vexed and flayed.

977
01:16:28,591 --> 01:16:31,890
If I recant these books...

978
01:16:33,329 --> 01:16:37,197
I will do nothing
but add strength to tyranny

979
01:16:37,267 --> 01:16:39,098
and open not just the windows
but also the doors

980
01:16:39,169 --> 01:16:40,761
to this great ungodliness.

981
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:44,368
He has condemned himself.

982
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:46,272
In the third group,

983
01:16:46,342 --> 01:16:49,038
I have written against
private persons and individuals

984
01:16:49,112 --> 01:16:50,602
who uphold Roman tyranny

985
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,548
and have attacked my own efforts
to encourage piety to Christ.

986
01:16:57,153 --> 01:16:58,142
I confess...

987
01:16:59,155 --> 01:17:01,453
that I have
written too harshly.

988
01:17:05,128 --> 01:17:07,289
I am but a man and I can err.

989
01:17:09,966 --> 01:17:14,562
Only let my errors
be proven by Scripture...

990
01:17:18,174 --> 01:17:22,304
and I will revoke my work
and throw my books into the fire.

991
01:17:22,378 --> 01:17:24,608
You have not
answered the question.

992
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,142
You, Martin Luther,

993
01:17:29,219 --> 01:17:31,346
will not draw into doubt
those things

994
01:17:31,421 --> 01:17:34,822
which the Catholic church
has judged already,

995
01:17:34,891 --> 01:17:38,190
things that have passed into usage,

996
01:17:38,261 --> 01:17:41,162
rite, and observance...

997
01:17:42,499 --> 01:17:43,932
the faith that Christ,

998
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,629
the most perfect Lawgiver,
ordained,

999
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:50,935
the faith the martyrs
strengthened with their blood.

1000
01:17:54,611 --> 01:17:56,841
You wait in vain
for a disputation

1001
01:17:56,913 --> 01:18:00,007
over things that
you are obligated to believe.

1002
01:18:02,252 --> 01:18:04,345
Now give your answer.

1003
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:08,953
Yes or no?

1004
01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:15,823
Will you recant or will you not?

1005
01:18:27,143 --> 01:18:29,202
Since Your Majesty
and Your Lordships

1006
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:32,180
desire a simple reply...

1007
01:18:35,485 --> 01:18:36,782
I will answer.

1008
01:18:40,824 --> 01:18:44,555
Unless I am convinced

1009
01:18:44,627 --> 01:18:46,390
by Scripture

1010
01:18:46,462 --> 01:18:48,760
and by plain reason...

1011
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,331
and not by Popes and councils

1012
01:18:52,402 --> 01:18:55,428
who have so often
contradicted themselves...

1013
01:18:57,907 --> 01:19:03,743
my conscience is captive
to the word of God.

1014
01:19:03,813 --> 01:19:07,340
To go against conscience
is neither right nor safe.

1015
01:19:11,688 --> 01:19:12,882
I cannot...

1016
01:19:15,692 --> 01:19:18,889
and I will not recant.

1017
01:19:21,497 --> 01:19:22,987
Here I stand.

1018
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:28,398
I can do no other.

1019
01:19:29,873 --> 01:19:32,239
God help me.

1020
01:19:32,308 --> 01:19:34,242
Yes, Martin:

1021
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:36,437
- The man's a heretic:
- He's a prophet of God:

1022
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:39,212
Order:

1023
01:19:51,828 --> 01:19:54,626
Young Martin walks out:

1024
01:19:54,697 --> 01:19:56,597
You have your answer:

1025
01:19:59,202 --> 01:20:00,191
Order:

1026
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:05,006
Order:

1027
01:20:10,346 --> 01:20:11,335
Order:

1028
01:20:12,548 --> 01:20:15,142
- Luther:
- No, it's not that simple.

1029
01:20:15,218 --> 01:20:17,049
- Luther:
...the word of God:

1030
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,782
Luther: Luther:

1031
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:21,653
God bless you, Martin:

1032
01:20:26,529 --> 01:20:27,860
Luther:

1033
01:20:27,931 --> 01:20:32,994
Luther: Luther: Luther:

1034
01:20:39,943 --> 01:20:41,342
Make way:

1035
01:20:48,017 --> 01:20:51,418
I am descended
from a line of Christian emperors.

1036
01:20:51,487 --> 01:20:53,921
You will not make a heretic of me.

1037
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:56,424
He has condemned himself,
Excellency.

1038
01:20:56,492 --> 01:20:59,290
He must be stopped before
he infects all of Germany.

1039
01:21:02,932 --> 01:21:07,562
My lord, you gave Luther
the promise of a safe conduct.

1040
01:21:09,172 --> 01:21:11,299
Luther's not a man but a demon,

1041
01:21:11,374 --> 01:21:14,400
clothed in his religious habit,
the better to deceive us.

1042
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:18,674
Martin Luther's your subject.

1043
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,213
What do you say?

1044
01:21:21,284 --> 01:21:25,380
He is too daring for me,
my lord.

1045
01:21:26,689 --> 01:21:31,422
Although not, it seems,
for the people.

1046
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:36,391
If anything should happen
to him on the way back...

1047
01:21:38,868 --> 01:21:40,335
so be it.

1048
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,535
Thank you:

1049
01:21:52,148 --> 01:21:55,743
God bless your journey home,
Brother Martin:

1050
01:21:57,754 --> 01:22:00,314
You'll always be
in our hearts, Martin:

1051
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:03,188
Truth will out, Brother Martin:

1052
01:22:03,259 --> 01:22:05,284
God be with you:

1053
01:22:21,677 --> 01:22:23,770
Why are they leaving us?

1054
01:22:47,804 --> 01:22:48,793
Wait.

1055
01:22:55,511 --> 01:22:56,500
Martin.

1056
01:23:05,488 --> 01:23:09,584
Martin Luther, step down
and your comrade will be spared.

1057
01:23:11,394 --> 01:23:12,861
I'm Luther.

1058
01:23:12,929 --> 01:23:14,055
Ulrick, no:

1059
01:23:18,234 --> 01:23:19,701
I am Luther.

1060
01:24:44,854 --> 01:24:46,515
Spalatin:

1061
01:24:48,624 --> 01:24:50,387
Sorry about the rough ride.

1062
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:54,224
Prince Frederick was keen
to nab you before someone else did.

1063
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:17,642
Tley mmay lave mmundened Lutlen.

1064
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,280
but they will not stop
what we have started.

1065
01:25:20,356 --> 01:25:22,119
The holy war has just begun:

1066
01:25:22,191 --> 01:25:25,251
Any man who holds himself up
as the master of others,

1067
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:27,592
whether he be prince,
Pope, priest, even professor,

1068
01:25:27,663 --> 01:25:31,429
must repent...
must repent or be cut down:

1069
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,593
You call me Professor Carlstadt.

1070
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:35,068
No more:

1071
01:25:36,072 --> 01:25:39,599
From this day forward,
I am Brother Andreas.

1072
01:25:39,675 --> 01:25:41,108
Yes.

1073
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:43,338
And all of you, likewise,

1074
01:25:43,412 --> 01:25:47,143
prepare yourselves
for the great leveling:

1075
01:25:47,216 --> 01:25:49,150
Yes:

1076
01:25:52,955 --> 01:25:56,482
"Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image."

1077
01:25:56,559 --> 01:25:58,959
Learn to despise
props and pretensions.

1078
01:26:00,529 --> 01:26:04,056
Stand with the righteous,
or be cut down with the others.

1079
01:26:04,133 --> 01:26:06,294
There is no middle ground:

1080
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:07,358
Teach us:

1081
01:26:10,273 --> 01:26:13,071
Martin would never have shamed
a student for wearing a crucifix:

1082
01:26:13,142 --> 01:26:15,337
I know Martin Luther.
I discovered him.

1083
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:17,902
He said reform.
You want revolt:

1084
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:20,813
If you haven't got the stomach to finish
what he started, Melanchthon, step aside.

1085
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:22,612
Why are you babbling in riddles?

1086
01:26:22,685 --> 01:26:24,346
Beware, or you too
shall be cut down.

1087
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,409
What?

1088
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:36,696
I asked for a Greek New Testament.

1089
01:26:39,001 --> 01:26:41,231
I need proper books,
not this rubbish.

1090
01:26:44,106 --> 01:26:45,698
And a Greek-German dictionary.

1091
01:26:48,444 --> 01:26:49,433
Leave us.

1092
01:26:50,613 --> 01:26:52,274
And a Greek-Latin dictionary.

1093
01:27:11,634 --> 01:27:13,602
This is not the time, Martin.

1094
01:27:13,669 --> 01:27:16,194
Well, the Emperor's
going to burn me, anyway.

1095
01:27:18,174 --> 01:27:19,368
He'll burn us all.

1096
01:27:20,776 --> 01:27:21,936
This is treason.

1097
01:27:22,011 --> 01:27:24,605
To have a New Testament
in German,

1098
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,774
in words ordinary people
can understand?

1099
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:30,216
Yes:

1100
01:27:32,822 --> 01:27:35,382
It's the thing Rome fears most.

1101
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:39,917
Well, you must blame
the Author for that.

1102
01:27:46,602 --> 01:27:48,433
The wall...
break it down:

1103
01:27:48,504 --> 01:27:50,165
Make breaches:

1104
01:27:59,382 --> 01:28:02,874
No popes: No witches:
No priests:

1105
01:28:02,952 --> 01:28:05,443
This cursed house...
pull her down:

1106
01:28:05,521 --> 01:28:06,954
Come out, you...

1107
01:28:12,161 --> 01:28:15,722
- How do you expect to do this?
- Just give us our rights:

1108
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:26,801
Blasphemers:

1109
01:28:38,421 --> 01:28:40,013
We must send in soldiers.

1110
01:28:40,089 --> 01:28:42,080
And cause more bloodshed?

1111
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:46,094
If Wittenberg cannot settle
its religious problems without that,

1112
01:28:46,162 --> 01:28:49,427
then the rest of the world
will not be impressed.

1113
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,967
Send for Luther.

1114
01:29:01,577 --> 01:29:03,067
How's the work?

1115
01:29:05,347 --> 01:29:06,439
Tricky.

1116
01:29:06,515 --> 01:29:07,777
Words are like children...

1117
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:11,286
the more care you lavish on them,
the more they demand.

1118
01:29:11,353 --> 01:29:12,877
Rather like women.

1119
01:29:12,955 --> 01:29:14,616
I wouldn't know.

1120
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:16,487
Take this verse in Saint Luke...

1121
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:18,618
"It is the father's will
that nothing be lost."

1122
01:29:18,694 --> 01:29:21,754
In our language, the word "will"
denotes strength, willpower,

1123
01:29:21,831 --> 01:29:23,389
bending someone to your will.

1124
01:29:24,433 --> 01:29:28,028
But in the original Greek,
this three-letter word

1125
01:29:28,103 --> 01:29:31,129
denotes passion, fire,
inner organs.

1126
01:29:31,207 --> 01:29:35,371
It can mean beloved,
desire, even sexual desire.

1127
01:29:36,946 --> 01:29:38,311
Eat your porridge.

1128
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:39,779
You're not even listening.

1129
01:29:39,849 --> 01:29:42,511
Besides, porridge does
nothing for my bowels.

1130
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,949
No, it's not the word
that's important,

1131
01:29:48,023 --> 01:29:49,991
but what it's saying about God.

1132
01:29:56,332 --> 01:29:58,163
You are too much alone here.

1133
01:30:00,002 --> 01:30:02,766
"You are too much alone here."
Oh, very good, Spalatin.

1134
01:30:02,838 --> 01:30:06,399
Two weeks since you last came.
Of course I'm too much alone:

1135
01:30:06,475 --> 01:30:09,603
How can I write for our people
when I don't live among them?

1136
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:14,572
The language of the Bible should be
like a mother talking to her children.

1137
01:30:18,854 --> 01:30:20,287
Well, it's decided,

1138
01:30:20,356 --> 01:30:23,416
Martin Luther
must not leave this room.

1139
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:26,860
But Knight George...

1140
01:30:27,696 --> 01:30:28,685
may.

1141
01:30:28,764 --> 01:30:31,790
It's time you saw
for yourself, Martin.

1142
01:30:35,204 --> 01:30:37,468
Why? Why were they killed?

1143
01:30:40,376 --> 01:30:41,934
No reason.

1144
01:30:42,011 --> 01:30:44,241
Just happened to be
in the wrong place,

1145
01:30:44,313 --> 01:30:47,646
got in the way of a mob of peasants
looting a monastery.

1146
01:30:47,716 --> 01:30:50,241
The whole world's
been turned upside-down

1147
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:51,718
by that madman Luther.

1148
01:30:52,988 --> 01:30:55,081
And him saying that
every Christian has the right

1149
01:30:55,157 --> 01:30:57,318
to take what they need by force.

1150
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:00,322
Well, Luther's gone,

1151
01:31:00,396 --> 01:31:04,423
but his damned ideas have
set the whole earth on fire.

1152
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,264
Soon this country will be blazing.

1153
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,837
Please: Let me go
in the name of God:

1154
01:31:26,055 --> 01:31:27,079
Help me:

1155
01:31:29,258 --> 01:31:30,316
Please stop:

1156
01:31:33,095 --> 01:31:37,589
Take off your Roman dresses
or have them burnt off:

1157
01:31:41,904 --> 01:31:44,668
Cowards: Cowards:

1158
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,264
Cowards:

1159
01:31:48,143 --> 01:31:49,701
How dare you?

1160
01:31:49,778 --> 01:31:52,611
You call yourselves Christians?

1161
01:31:52,681 --> 01:31:54,148
Christians? :

1162
01:31:54,216 --> 01:31:57,208
You, why are you standing there?
Put out this fire:

1163
01:31:57,286 --> 01:31:58,776
Run: Buckets: Shovels: Run:

1164
01:31:58,854 --> 01:32:01,118
When a limb is rotten,
you must cut it off.

1165
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:03,181
- You know that as well as I.
- Get out:

1166
01:32:03,258 --> 01:32:05,351
Martin, this is for you:
Let it burn:

1167
01:32:05,427 --> 01:32:08,294
Get out of Wittenberg
before I beat you out:

1168
01:32:08,364 --> 01:32:09,661
Beat me out?

1169
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:12,997
I defended you.
I supported you.

1170
01:32:13,068 --> 01:32:15,263
I'm carrying on
just as you would have.

1171
01:32:15,337 --> 01:32:16,998
You think this is my work?

1172
01:32:17,873 --> 01:32:20,137
This is never my work:

1173
01:32:20,209 --> 01:32:21,972
No, it's the people's work:

1174
01:32:22,978 --> 01:32:24,275
The people's work:

1175
01:32:27,216 --> 01:32:28,410
It's the people's work.

1176
01:32:32,354 --> 01:32:33,753
The people's work:

1177
01:32:42,398 --> 01:32:43,763
Spalatin.

1178
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:49,960
Are you there?

1179
01:32:52,307 --> 01:32:55,208
Now, how is he?

1180
01:32:55,277 --> 01:32:57,302
Luther's depressed, my lord.

1181
01:32:57,379 --> 01:32:58,710
Confused.

1182
01:33:00,315 --> 01:33:03,409
He feels the peasants
have twisted his language.

1183
01:33:03,485 --> 01:33:05,043
But he will join them?

1184
01:33:06,822 --> 01:33:08,915
Luther abhors violence.

1185
01:33:08,991 --> 01:33:12,290
But he's in sympathy
with their grievances?

1186
01:33:13,328 --> 01:33:16,957
It's hard to argue against
freeing people from crippling taxes

1187
01:33:17,032 --> 01:33:19,796
or the purgatory of being
born slaves all their lives.

1188
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:24,068
You know, if Luther
were to lift one finger,

1189
01:33:24,139 --> 01:33:28,439
every peasant in Germany
would rise up behind him.

1190
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:29,499
Maybe.

1191
01:33:31,714 --> 01:33:34,808
Luther's a theologian, my lord.

1192
01:33:34,883 --> 01:33:37,909
He fights,
but with his tongue or his pen.

1193
01:33:37,986 --> 01:33:39,647
He will not dnaw tle swond.

1194
01:33:50,532 --> 01:33:53,330
I lave finally
tonn tle wonld apant.

1195
01:33:53,402 --> 01:33:56,303

and low tley lave
answened mmy call:

1197

1204
01:34:56,532 --> 01:34:59,228
You don't want to
go in there, sir.

1205
01:35:32,668 --> 01:35:33,726
It's over.

1206
01:35:35,838 --> 01:35:38,432
Yes. It's over.

1207
01:35:42,177 --> 01:35:43,269
How many?

1208
01:35:46,782 --> 01:35:47,908
No one knows yet.

1209
01:35:49,117 --> 01:35:50,106
How many?

1210
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,747
Some say 50,000.

1211
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:55,984
Some 100.

1212
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,950
100,000...

1213
01:36:01,463 --> 01:36:02,657
dead peasants.

1214
01:36:04,132 --> 01:36:06,157
There were knights among them.

1215
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:13,707
That's a plague, Spalatin.

1216
01:36:15,477 --> 01:36:16,535
That's butchery.

1217
01:36:19,815 --> 01:36:21,214
Have a care, Martin.

1218
01:36:22,317 --> 01:36:24,581
You may need these butchers.

1219
01:37:19,975 --> 01:37:20,964
Grete.

1220
01:38:20,602 --> 01:38:22,593
We are seeking Dr. Luther.

1221
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:28,403
Please. My sisters and I
escaped three days ago

1222
01:38:28,477 --> 01:38:30,206
from the convent at Nimbschen.

1223
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:38,379
And... you still came here?

1224
01:38:38,453 --> 01:38:41,286
Because this is
where Dr. Luther lives.

1225
01:38:43,492 --> 01:38:47,087
Sir, we were smuggled out
in these herring barrels.

1226
01:38:47,162 --> 01:38:49,790
We've been two nights
on an open wagon,

1227
01:38:49,865 --> 01:38:52,857
have had no rest,
no food, no sleep.

1228
01:38:54,169 --> 01:38:55,636
So if you could just tell me...

1229
01:38:55,704 --> 01:38:56,693
I...

1230
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:00,240
I'm Luther.

1231
01:39:01,843 --> 01:39:03,743
Katharina von Bora.

1232
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:05,211
Martin Luther.

1233
01:39:06,214 --> 01:39:07,613
But you know that already.

1234
01:39:09,785 --> 01:39:11,582
I'll take you to a shelter.

1235
01:39:28,370 --> 01:39:29,530
Who's there?

1236
01:39:36,378 --> 01:39:37,367
No.

1237
01:39:40,582 --> 01:39:42,447
Martin Luther?

1238
01:39:42,517 --> 01:39:44,178
My lord.

1239
01:39:45,253 --> 01:39:49,155
Well. We meet at last.

1240
01:39:54,563 --> 01:39:57,259
I dedicated this work
to you, my lord.

1241
01:39:57,365 --> 01:39:59,356
The translation
of the New Testament...

1242
01:40:00,702 --> 01:40:02,260
into our own language.

1243
01:40:02,337 --> 01:40:03,964
Into German?

1244
01:40:08,844 --> 01:40:13,076
But this will
separate us from Rome...

1245
01:40:14,149 --> 01:40:15,377
forever.

1246
01:40:16,451 --> 01:40:19,545
I have always
sought Christian unity,

1247
01:40:19,621 --> 01:40:22,556
but not at the price of servitude.

1248
01:40:22,624 --> 01:40:24,251
I answer to God's law,

1249
01:40:24,326 --> 01:40:26,123
not Roman.

1250
01:40:27,195 --> 01:40:29,663
Roman law is the reality.

1251
01:40:29,731 --> 01:40:31,494
I believe in the reality of Christ.

1252
01:40:31,566 --> 01:40:33,329
With no compromises?

1253
01:40:33,401 --> 01:40:34,663
None.

1254
01:40:38,974 --> 01:40:41,875
You realize, of course,
they'll take this to be

1255
01:40:41,943 --> 01:40:44,309
an act of sheer provocation.

1256
01:40:44,379 --> 01:40:45,710
Yes.

1257
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:48,248
And they will not hesitate
to strike back.

1258
01:40:48,316 --> 01:40:50,079
Yes, I know.

1259
01:40:53,155 --> 01:40:56,181
Well, so long as you know.

1260
01:41:00,495 --> 01:41:03,521
Do you think I could have
my present now?

1261
01:41:06,501 --> 01:41:07,627
Yes, of course.

1262
01:41:25,654 --> 01:41:28,885
Take my heart

1263
01:41:32,427 --> 01:41:36,591
And never worry

1264
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,201
Evil tongues will mock

1265
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:45,137
We'll mock in turn

1266
01:41:45,207 --> 01:41:49,644
For my heart
is my gift to thee

1267
01:41:52,948 --> 01:41:55,883
Have not a care

1268
01:41:57,852 --> 01:41:59,752
Never worry

1269
01:41:59,821 --> 01:42:01,220
Stay, Ulrick, stay.

1270
01:42:01,289 --> 01:42:02,654
Please.

1271
01:42:02,724 --> 01:42:04,521
Marry one of
these lovely young women.

1272
01:42:04,593 --> 01:42:06,390
I know there's at least one left.

1273
01:42:06,461 --> 01:42:08,258
I'll bring God's word
to my homeland.

1274
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:10,798
No, this is not a good time.
No prince can protect you there.

1275
01:42:10,865 --> 01:42:13,060
I want the Dutch people to know

1276
01:42:13,134 --> 01:42:16,035
what I experienced when I
read His word for the first time.

1277
01:42:20,175 --> 01:42:21,437
Then God be with you.

1278
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:27,170
And with you, Martin.

1279
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:36,950
You left so quickly,
I feared it was my singing.

1280
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:38,356
If only it were.

1281
01:42:39,361 --> 01:42:40,555
Look at him.

1282
01:42:40,629 --> 01:42:43,063
He goes to his fate,
hurrying like a bridegroom.

1283
01:42:43,131 --> 01:42:45,861
Not all bridegrooms
are so fleet.

1284
01:42:48,136 --> 01:42:51,071
I would not say the bachelors
of Wittenberg have been tardy.

1285
01:42:51,139 --> 01:42:52,128
True.

1286
01:42:52,207 --> 01:42:54,767
The other nuns are all spoken for.

1287
01:42:54,843 --> 01:42:56,504
And you've made it so clear
that marriage

1288
01:42:56,578 --> 01:42:58,045
is an honorable estate...

1289
01:42:58,113 --> 01:43:00,047
for everyone else, at least.

1290
01:43:00,115 --> 01:43:03,744
- I see why you scare them.
- My grief is that I scare you.

1291
01:43:03,818 --> 01:43:05,342
I know you like me, Doctor.

1292
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:07,581
I feel your heart
when we make music together.

1293
01:43:07,656 --> 01:43:09,920
But when the music ends,
you flee.

1294
01:43:12,327 --> 01:43:15,490
I'm a man of blood, Katie.
I divide people.

1295
01:43:16,498 --> 01:43:18,898
Thousands have died
because of me.

1296
01:43:18,967 --> 01:43:22,164
Most days I'm so depressed
I can't even get out of bed.

1297
01:43:24,706 --> 01:43:27,140
People try to make me
a fixed star.

1298
01:43:28,843 --> 01:43:29,969
But I'm not.

1299
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,147
I'm a wandering planet.

1300
01:43:34,182 --> 01:43:35,911
No one should
look to me for guidance.

1301
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,249
Two things I promise you...

1302
01:43:44,326 --> 01:43:46,817
we will make
joyous music together,

1303
01:43:46,895 --> 01:43:48,658
and to get to you,

1304
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:51,426
your enemies will have to
step across my dead body.

1305
01:43:52,801 --> 01:43:55,429
In return,
I ask only one thing...

1306
01:43:55,503 --> 01:43:59,337
that you bring none of them
to our marriage bed,

1307
01:43:59,407 --> 01:44:02,706
not peasants or princes or Popes,

1308
01:44:02,777 --> 01:44:05,575
unless He be a God of love.

1309
01:44:24,499 --> 01:44:26,433
For God's sake,
at least get new candles:

1310
01:44:26,501 --> 01:44:28,594
- There's nothing left except these.
- Now:

1311
01:44:40,181 --> 01:44:42,945
So mmucl fon Leo
wlo would nebuild Romme...

1312
01:44:44,452 --> 01:44:48,286
Banknupt.
800.000 ducats in debt.

1313
01:44:49,624 --> 01:44:52,286
Had le lived. Le would lave
sold tle Vatican itself.

1314
01:44:53,661 --> 01:44:56,892
But as a Pope,
he could have changed the world.

1315
01:44:58,133 --> 01:45:02,069
He could have reformed the church
instead of just rebuilding it.

1316
01:45:03,638 --> 01:45:07,734
Leo was a spiritual dwarf
when we needed a giant like Luther.

1317
01:45:07,809 --> 01:45:09,401
Well, Luther's getting married.

1318
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:15,073
To a runaway nun.

1319
01:45:19,821 --> 01:45:21,652
He wouldn't dare.

1320
01:45:38,072 --> 01:45:39,505
If I wene to tell you tlat

1321
01:45:39,574 --> 01:45:41,804
Albent of Mainz sent us
a wedding pnesent.

1322
01:45:41,876 --> 01:45:43,366
wlat would you say?

1323
01:45:43,445 --> 01:45:44,537
Send it back.

1324
01:45:44,612 --> 01:45:46,910
Then it's as well
he did no such thing,

1325
01:45:46,981 --> 01:45:49,006
or we'd be having
our first quarrel.

1326
01:45:53,788 --> 01:45:55,483
Martin.

1327
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,767
They are going to burn Ulrick:
They caught him at the border.

1328
01:46:35,663 --> 01:46:37,426
What is it?
What has happened?

1329
01:46:37,499 --> 01:46:39,433
The Emperor summons
our princes to Augsburg.

1330
01:46:39,501 --> 01:46:40,661
Why?

1331
01:46:40,735 --> 01:46:43,226
To finish
what he began at Worms.

1332
01:46:43,304 --> 01:46:45,966
You mustn't go.
They'll fry you like a suckling pig.

1333
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:48,235
If you die, everything
you stand for dies with you.

1334
01:46:48,309 --> 01:46:51,039
All right, what will you say? How will you
make them change their minds?

1335
01:46:51,112 --> 01:46:53,740
- I don't know.
- Well, I need to know:

1336
01:46:53,815 --> 01:46:55,680
Katie, first they
wanted me to recant.

1337
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:58,378
Now they want half of Europe
to bow the knee.

1338
01:46:58,453 --> 01:46:59,579
We must fight:

1339
01:47:00,788 --> 01:47:02,585
Let somebody else fight.

1340
01:47:02,657 --> 01:47:06,354
Let somebody else be
roasted like a pig:

1341
01:47:23,645 --> 01:47:25,806
All I want is Luther.

1342
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:28,610
Break the princes,
and you break Luther.

1343
01:47:29,684 --> 01:47:32,676
Their tactics will be to delay,

1344
01:47:32,754 --> 01:47:35,245
to bog the process down in detail.

1345
01:47:37,158 --> 01:47:38,489
Luther's hymns.

1346
01:47:40,828 --> 01:47:42,022
They are.

1347
01:47:43,264 --> 01:47:45,630
You must keep the issues
simple, Excellency.

1348
01:47:46,768 --> 01:47:48,668
They must accept
there is only one church.

1349
01:47:53,441 --> 01:47:56,069
This plague
just goes on spreading.

1350
01:47:58,613 --> 01:47:59,978
I should have burned him:

1351
01:48:10,124 --> 01:48:13,184
My pninces. Bnotlens in Clnist.

1352
01:48:13,261 --> 01:48:15,422
tlis isn't a timme fon caution.

1353
01:48:15,496 --> 01:48:17,623
but fon boldness.

1354
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:21,328
Clanles is not tle fnigltened youtl
you saw at Wonmms. Dn. Lutlen.

1355
01:48:21,402 --> 01:48:24,098
He las lummbled Fnance
and sacked Romme itself.

1356
01:48:24,172 --> 01:48:26,163
Only the Turk
remains a threat to him.

1357
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:29,732
In a word, he has all the time
and resource in the world

1358
01:48:29,811 --> 01:48:31,745
to reduce us to a powder
piece by piece,

1359
01:48:31,813 --> 01:48:33,747
state by state.

1360
01:48:33,815 --> 01:48:36,807
And I think he means to do it.

1361
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:40,446
My lords...

1362
01:48:42,156 --> 01:48:44,522
silence will not save us.

1363
01:48:44,592 --> 01:48:46,924
If we challenge Charles,

1364
01:48:46,995 --> 01:48:48,792
will there be war...

1365
01:48:50,365 --> 01:48:52,595
the awful shedding
of yet more blood?

1366
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:56,125
I honestly don't know. I've mislaid
all my former certainties.

1367
01:48:56,204 --> 01:48:57,796
But think.

1368
01:49:00,675 --> 01:49:04,008
The Emperor invites us
to present our creeds,

1369
01:49:04,078 --> 01:49:06,911
to present what we believe in.

1370
01:49:06,981 --> 01:49:09,973
Satan invites us to preach in hell.

1371
01:49:10,985 --> 01:49:12,452
Is that a trap?

1372
01:49:15,857 --> 01:49:18,883
Or our greatest opportunity so far?

1373
01:49:19,961 --> 01:49:23,362
And remember, since I may not
come with you to Augsburg,

1374
01:49:23,431 --> 01:49:26,366
you'll face Charles' rough alone.

1375
01:49:34,375 --> 01:49:35,808
Your choice is simple.

1376
01:49:37,245 --> 01:49:40,476
If you give in, my lords,
the bright comet that is our faith

1377
01:49:40,548 --> 01:49:45,144
will shatter and be reduced
to a few isolated torches,

1378
01:49:45,219 --> 01:49:48,086
sputtering in a dark universe.

1379
01:49:54,128 --> 01:49:55,527
This way:

1380
01:50:17,552 --> 01:50:21,181
And why does the father run
to meet his prodigal son?

1381
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:23,782
Landowners don't run.

1382
01:50:23,958 --> 01:50:25,687
Noblemen don't run.

1383
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:27,293
Princes don't run.

1384
01:50:28,296 --> 01:50:32,596
So why does this rich,
landowning father run?

1385
01:50:35,837 --> 01:50:37,964
Because he's afraid.

1386
01:50:38,039 --> 01:50:42,339
He's so afraid that his son
will run back to the filthy pig farm.

1387
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:45,971
He runs
because he loves his son.

1388
01:50:46,047 --> 01:50:50,313
And there's
a special word for this love.

1389
01:50:51,986 --> 01:50:52,975
Compassion.

1390
01:50:53,988 --> 01:50:55,580
Compassion.

1391
01:50:55,656 --> 01:50:58,853
And you know
what this word means?

1392
01:51:01,496 --> 01:51:03,487
It's just a church bell, Martin,

1393
01:51:03,564 --> 01:51:05,156
ringing the Angelus.

1394
01:51:10,138 --> 01:51:11,935
Continue the story.

1395
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,393
Beloved princes of the Empire,

1396
01:51:35,463 --> 01:51:38,296
I will be brief
and to the point.

1397
01:51:38,366 --> 01:51:41,096
Your ministers
shall not preach,

1398
01:51:41,169 --> 01:51:43,865
and you will outlaw these Bibles
in the common language

1399
01:51:43,938 --> 01:51:48,875
and declare anyone who possesses one
an enemy of the state.

1400
01:51:58,085 --> 01:52:00,781
We will not stop our ministers
from preaching the word,

1401
01:52:00,855 --> 01:52:02,914
here or anywhere else.

1402
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:05,151
Do not concede, my lord.

1403
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:11,892
We will not outlaw
the new Bible, my lord.

1404
01:52:13,134 --> 01:52:15,102
As a sign
of your loyalty to me,

1405
01:52:15,169 --> 01:52:17,160
tomorrow you shall all march

1406
01:52:17,238 --> 01:52:19,672
in the Corpus Christi procession
to the cathedral

1407
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:24,439
and worship, all of you,
in the Roman manner.

1408
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:39,254
We will not, my lord.

1409
01:52:39,327 --> 01:52:40,316
You will:

1410
01:52:41,329 --> 01:52:43,923
Or you shall know my sword:

1411
01:52:43,998 --> 01:52:46,592
Before I let anyone
take from me the word of God

1412
01:52:46,667 --> 01:52:49,295
and ask me to deny my belief,

1413
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:55,104
I will kneel
and let him strike off my head.

1414
01:53:39,987 --> 01:53:45,015
Your Highness, we have drawn up
a confession of our faith

1415
01:53:45,092 --> 01:53:47,959
which I believe
you will find blameless.

1416
01:54:24,799 --> 01:54:27,199
I am so very happy
to have been loved by you...

1417
01:54:28,469 --> 01:54:29,766
Katharina von Bora.

1418
01:54:40,448 --> 01:54:43,383
Martin: Martin:

1419
01:54:43,451 --> 01:54:46,011
We did it, Martin:

1420
01:54:46,087 --> 01:54:47,349
We did it:

1421
01:54:47,421 --> 01:54:50,982
The Emperor allowed us to read
our confession of faith:

1422
01:54:51,058 --> 01:54:53,891
The princes stood up to him:

1423
01:54:54,962 --> 01:54:56,361
He had to listen:

1424
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:59,228
They can't stop us now,
Martin:
