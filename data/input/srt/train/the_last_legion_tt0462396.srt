1
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:33,490
THE LAST LEGION

2
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:41,040
The legend began
beneath these dark hills

3
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,001
and under this same sky.

4
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,255
It tells of a sword of great power

5
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,633
forged for the conqueror, Julius Caesar.

6
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,762
This weapon was passed down

7
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,849
until it reached the
last of Caesars noble line,

8
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,060
the Emperor Tiberius.

9
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,774
On his death, it was hidden away
to keep from the hands of evil men.

10
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:13,947
For generations, it lay in a secret
place marked by the sign of a pentangle

11
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,452
and, as it was written,
under the very gaze of Caesar.

12
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,540
I, Ambrosinus, born in Britannia...

13
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,252
...was one of many men
who sought it.

14
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:35,177
In a time of injustice, I made it
my life's task to find the sword

15
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,472
and the one righteous
enough to wield it.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,266
I journeyed far across the continent,

17
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,104
to the heart of an empire that
ruled half the known world.

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,692
Now a threatened Rome
was calling back her bravest

19
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,487
and best to defend her boundaries.

20
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,413
ROME 460 A.D.

21
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,597
Greetings, Aurelius.

22
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,562
Make way!

23
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,827
Good to be home, commander?

24
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:46,623
Is this what I'm supposed to wear?
I can't even remember how to put it on.

25
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,379
Why us, Vatrenus, huh? Why me?

26
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,757
Because they trust you.
You are a true Roman.

27
00:02:55,925 --> 00:03:00,262
Besides, it's a glorious thing,
they say, to guard the new Caesar.

28
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,140
We held Africa for them
for ten years.

29
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,560
Grew old on their battlefields.
Lost good men.

30
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,732
- What was it all for?
- We're soldiers, Aurelius.

31
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,151
Politicians make the decisions.

32
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,113
Two breeds of men
to be avoided like the pox...

33
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,407
...politicians and philosophers.

34
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,788
You know, in Alexandria,
they cut off the hand that steals.

35
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,415
No, please.

36
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,419
Once the hand is off, it's for God
to decide whether you live or die.

37
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,629
Most die.

38
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,006
Batiatus!

39
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,762
Do it outside, it'll make a mess.
Blood everywhere.

40
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,059
- He's lame in the forefoot.

41
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,688
- Who's this?
- A thief caught in the act.

42
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,566
- I'm not a thief.
- No, he's yours, big man.

43
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,028
- One hand or two, commander?
- Oh, just the one.

44
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,251
No, let me go, please!
I wasn't gonna steal it, I swear to you.

45
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,628
- I give you my word.
- Your word?

46
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:20,092
You? A street boy.
A thief.

47
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,178
How can you be a man of your word?
I just wanted to look at it.

48
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,516
I'm Aurlianus Caius Antonius,
citizen of Rome,

49
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,561
commander of the Imperial Guard,
and I'm asking you, would you lie to me?

50
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,858
I would not lie to you.

51
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,658
You come back in ten years, boy.

52
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,161
I'll give you your own sword.

53
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,790
Now get out of here.

54
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,127
Another worthy foe vanguished,
then, commander?

55
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,506
- Are you thirsty ?
- It's heartening to see

56
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,884
- Soldiers of Rome dispiay such valour.
- Who are you?

57
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,888
One who knows humiliation
to be a poor teacher...

58
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,601
- ...for both men and boys.
- I smell a philosopher.

59
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,812
Are you all right?

60
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,860
- Take the boy and go.
- In our own good time.

61
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,869
He said go, old man.

62
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,081
More than a philosopher, then.

63
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,564
How did he do that?

64
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,901
Every time we have goose for dinner,
you do that same old trick.

65
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,112
Oh, dear. Have I done that one before?

66
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,949
- And I didn't need your help.

67
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,952
By the way, you missed
your Greek lesson.

68
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,789
How come you never told me
you knew how to fight?

69
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,584
Get out of here.
Both of you. Go, go.

70
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,961
Let them pass.

71
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,890
- Odoacer.
- Orestes.

72
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,143
For ten years I have supported Rome.

73
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,979
Ten years! My warriors fought
beside your legions.

74
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,732
- Who is that?
- The Commander of the Goths.

75
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,485
So now here I am,

76
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,821
to claim my dues.

77
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,614
And what are your dues, general?

78
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,867
- One third of all Italy.

79
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,620
- You think I'm joking?
- Is this true, Orestes?

80
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,580
- Did you make such a pact?
- No.

81
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,209
How could I promise
what isn't mine to give?

82
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,922
One third of Italy!
That way, the allianct continues.

83
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:09,094
And your new caesar will not topple from
his throne like the others before him.

84
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,889
I promised you nothing beyond
the rewards you already given.

85
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,019
You have grown so tall, Orestes.

86
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,315
You forget whose shoulders you stand on.

87
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,200
Romulus, where have you been?

88
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,828
We've been looking everuwhere.

89
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:40,417
Ambrosinus, you took him outside,
without a guard?

90
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,668
You know the danger.

91
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,421
It's a fine morning. We went for a walk.
No harm done.

92
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,966
A walk? You know what
tomorrow holds for him?

93
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,387
- For all of us?
- I know perfectIy weII, Orestes.

94
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,389
I've as much care for your son as you.

95
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,308
What did you say?

96
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,481
You go too far, schoolmaster.

97
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,941
Leave us.

98
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:12,824
Orestes, sometimes i think you
forget he's just a boy.

99
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,661
He has your blood in his veins.
Bloodline ofthe Caesars.

100
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,206
- He was neverjust a boy.

101
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,672
Mother...

102
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,511
...in five years, there
have been five emperors...

103
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,305
...and they were all murdered.

104
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,519
What will happen to me?

105
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,651
You will be guarded by the best.

106
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,905
You will live long and rule wisely.

107
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,190
Romulus!

108
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:59,431
My son, this day you join the immortals.

109
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:38,136
Hail Caesar, Caesar, Caesar!

110
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,558
Mother, am I now
the most powerful man in the world?

111
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,893
You are.

112
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,312
Then why can't I stay out
on the day I'm crowned?

113
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,566
What am I to be, a god or a boy?

114
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,071
You are caesar.

115
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,907
And my Caesar must be protected.

116
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,745
- But who would harm me?
- The one you saw.

117
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,790
- Odoacer the Goth.
- He is our ally.

118
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,668
You, teacher of words and numbers,

119
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,129
what is the business
of the state to you?

120
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,966
My only concern is
the welfare of your son.

121
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,387
You may concern yourself no longer.
He is Caesar now.

122
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,765
He's still a boy.
Perhaps he still needs me.

123
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,016
Well...

124
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,646
Your task is over. Leave us.
Don't come back.

125
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,486
Romulus.

126
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,292
Hail Caesar.

127
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,548
This is Aurelius of the Nova Invicta.
He will command your personal guard.

128
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,093
May I see your sword, commander?

129
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,893
He must do everything to protect me
from harm, must he not, father?

130
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,064
- Indeed. He must.
- To the last breath.

131
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,986
- And do I have your word on that?
- You have his word.

132
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,446
He is sworn to serve you.

133
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,240
Is it so, commander?

134
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,372
Thank you.
I only wanted to look at it.

135
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,339
Open the gate.

136
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,010
And this is also
Caesar's will?

137
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,889
Now you've been weil
rewarded. Go back where you came from.

138
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:50,435
My crime is putting new ideas
into a young head.

139
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,230
- Teaching a lad to think for himself.
- This lad is our emperor.

140
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:58,359
Which do you serve?
Caesar or your own ideas?

141
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,321
A wise man never asks
what another man serves...

142
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,491
For only his actions
will speak the true answer.

143
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,367
You've read your Seneca.

144
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,370
I find poets as dangerous
as philosophers.

145
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,915
And you...

146
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,626
Where did you get this?

147
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,507
A long time ago.
In another land.

148
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,553
From a man who loved only power.

149
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,060
So you're an adventurer as well?

150
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,939
if I see you again in Rome,
it'll be on the point of my sword.

151
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,024
Take care in the mist, commander.

152
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,944
it may hide what the gods themselves
dare not look upon.

153
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,539
And who will guard
the guardians themselves?

154
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,998
Nestor?

155
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,667
Leave us.

156
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,756
The senator.

157
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,425
Well, these sit better on me
than armour ever did.

158
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,179
- How is it with you, Aurelius?
- Oh, a little older.

159
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,598
- No wiser.
- After all these years?

160
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,227
- Did you ever marry, have children?
- No.

161
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,315
- So, what do you make of Rome?
- Different. Uneasy.

162
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:23,862
If you are to guard our new Caesar,
keep your wits keep about you.

163
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,155
And come and see me.

164
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,034
- Friends are a rare commodity.
- I will.

165
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,346
The Goths! They've betrayed us!

166
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,152
You, to the wall.

167
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,657
- Commander!
- Prepare to fire!

168
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,370
- Release!
- Down!

169
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,835
Defend the emperor!

170
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,048
Back! Behind! Go, go!

171
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,800
They're going
to target the main gate.

172
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,305
Form wall!

173
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,601
On my command!

174
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,650
Hold the line!

175
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,155
- Get back, boy.
- To the walls!

176
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,698
Yahh!

177
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,533
Ahh!

178
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,446
Father!

179
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,283
Odoacer wants the boy alive!

180
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,287
I'll do my best.

181
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,721
Save yourself.

182
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,441
Yahh!

183
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:54,841
King, the emissary from Constantinople.

184
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:59,595
Welcome, Excellency.
The city is ours.

185
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,724
I ask that your empire recognise me
as the sole ruler of Rome

186
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:08,104
- and all her dominions.
- My emperor is in Constantinople.

187
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:14,235
I am his eyes and his ears,
but I cannot speak on his behalf.

188
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,529
Then go and seek his word.

189
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,959
Master.

190
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,087
Aurelius. Fetch water.

191
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,590
The boy, Caesar.

192
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,802
- Is he alive?
- I couldn't find him.

193
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,685
His mother and father were killed,
as were my men.

194
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,562
How did this happen?

195
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,316
Some of your men survived,
that I do know.

196
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:57,528
Vatrenus was taken prisoner.
There may be others with him, but...

197
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,988
...they're to be executed,

198
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,325
as an example to those
who would stand against Odoacer.

199
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,926
Come to me.

200
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,319
is it for you that
so many people have died?

201
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,364
Such an innocent fact.

202
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,450
The blood of the caesars
flows in his veins.

203
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,954
Lord Wulfila here thinks
that I should fear you.

204
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,539
Is this true?

205
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,960
He is the last of the blood line.
End it now.

206
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,255
- Old Rome will die, and we will rule.
- We?

207
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,632
We rule?

208
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,763
Take car, Wulfila. Sometimes
your tongue runs ahead of your brain.

209
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,900
What do you say, boy?

210
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,529
Should I be afraid of you?

211
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,241
Why is Caesar treated so?

212
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,994
"Why is Caesar treated so?"

213
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,879
Perhaps Wulfila's right.

214
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,382
Perhaps I should end this here,
right now.

215
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:51,183
Can you see yourself?
Can you see your fact?

216
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,689
What do you see?
Do you see a boy?

217
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,609
Or do you see a caesar?

218
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,156
- I see...
- Tell me.

219
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,077
I see a Caesar.

220
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,039
I am Caesar.

221
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,130
Wrong answer.

222
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,299
Take him away, cut his throat.

223
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,802
That would be
a grave error, Lord Odoacer.

224
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,513
Who are you?

225
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,808
Kill the boy,
you make a martyr of him.

226
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,311
And Caesar's ghost
will haunt you ever after.

227
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,521
- Is that so?
- Read the signs.

228
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,940
- What signs?
- An omen.

229
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,360
- Do not mistake it, Odoacer.

230
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,905
If you hear one thing,
then hear this.

231
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,991
What now happens in this room
will echo across an empire.

232
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,618
A city may be won by blood.

233
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,039
It takes a man of vision to rule.

234
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,042
- All empires are built on blood.
- People will judge you.

235
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,213
The people will thank the Gods
that they survived

236
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,966
and serve their new master.
Now I asked, who are you?

237
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,595
Will they respect a leader
who so feared a Roman child

238
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,889
he had to butcher him?

239
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,856
Perhaps the boy is
more use to us aIive than dead.

240
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,985
Do you want to look a fool?
Kill them both!

241
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,529
Fool?!

242
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:32,910
Your best hope for the future,
Lord Wulfila, lies in silence!

243
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:36,997
Give me your hand.

244
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,984
Now I ask, who are you?

245
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,987
- I'm known by many names.
- Like a thief.

246
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,239
Here I'm called Ambrosinus.

247
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,425
The boy will be taken to
the island fortress at Capri.

248
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,720
You... You will be his prison guard.

249
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,390
That's your reward.
No harm comes to him unless I say so.

250
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,436
Not a hair on his head.
You understand me?

251
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,859
And take this one too.

252
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,069
I don't trust him.

253
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,995
- Someone's here.
- Where?

254
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,504
Please.

255
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,714
Wait, Aurelius.
I know this man.

256
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,716
He speaks for the Eastern Empire.

257
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,260
- Is the boy alive?
- I saw him, in chains.

258
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,929
They're taking him to capri.

259
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,306
I'll find him, bring him back.

260
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,435
From capri? That's impossible.
It's an island, a natural fortress.

261
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,230
- I'll need my men.
- We've long been allies, senator.

262
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,441
Free your Caesar.

263
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,862
My emperor will give him sanctuary until
it is safe for him to return to Rome.

264
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,215
We meet at Fanum in six days,
on the beach.

265
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,843
If you bring back the boy,
there'll be a boat to take us east.

266
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,014
Six days then. To the last breath.

267
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,766
To the last breath.

268
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,478
What's this?

269
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,690
The ambassador's guard.
You'll need help to free your men.

270
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,150
These people are our allies, use them.

271
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,285
Follow me.

272
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,962
Act as my prisoner.
When I give the signal, try to escape.

273
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,506
You understand what I've told you, yes?

274
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,759
Then do as I've said and nothing more.

275
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,565
- Him first.

276
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,820
- Stop!

277
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,197
Another prisoner.

278
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,161
I'm to take
this one's head back to Rome.

279
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,747
An assassin sent to kill Lord Odoacer.

280
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,000
Go.

281
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,632
Get him!

282
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,138
Ambrosinus...

283
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,350
...I want to be with them.

284
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,435
I want to be with
my mother and father.

285
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,231
You are with them.
They live on in your heart.

286
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:19,071
You cannot see them, but it's as if you
are in one room and they're in the next.

287
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,991
- I should have died too.
- Not your destiny.

288
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,660
I have no destiny.

289
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:28,580
Every living creature has a destiny,
be sure of it.

290
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,626
But when the pathway gets dark,
and it's difficult to see the way...

291
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,839
Well...

292
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:41,301
...that's why you have me.
For all that I'm worth.

293
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,305
Damn bird.
Forgot to feed it.

294
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,559
- Fuge! Fuge!

295
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,602
I knew it.

296
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:55,107
- I knew it was a trick.
- Shh!

297
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,545
Is this our destiny?

298
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,006
To be prisoners
here for the rest of our lives?

299
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,927
Have faith.
There is a purpose behind all things.

300
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,028
Where is he now?

301
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,425
No sign of the Goths.
But we should stay close to the river.

302
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,805
- The river, yes.
- They'll have scouts all the way.

303
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,517
- Agreed. So we...
- Mira.

304
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,185
Yes.

305
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,358
- What?
- My name, Mira.

306
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,581
There's your boat.
How do you wanna do this?

307
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,791
If we all go down,
we'll scare him off.

308
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,751
He'll be gone before we get there.

309
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,387
Wait here.

310
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,020
He's a woman.

311
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,844
This fortress
was built as a palace by

312
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,056
the great Emperor Tiberius,
who, it is written,

313
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,391
was a man of great dignity and bearing.

314
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:20,520
- Both of which you've inherited.
- So my ancestors built my prison.

315
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,483
A prison it is.

316
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,494
You thirsty, boy, hm?
Go on, drink.

317
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,830
Hmm? Drink.

318
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,418
You dare insult me, boy?! Huh?

319
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,087
This is a long way down.

320
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,631
How many fingers
will it take you to learn?

321
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,467
Your fate lies in the palm
of this child's hand.

322
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,719
As sure as Odoacer is your master,

323
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,597
throw this boy to the rocks,
you wiII follow.

324
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,436
When the time comes, boy,

325
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:05,816
I will send you to join
your mother and your father.

326
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,567
Mmm?

327
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:14,658
You. Odoacer said nothing of you.

328
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,911
String him up!

329
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,624
Hold.

330
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,088
What is this?

331
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,591
Are you some kind of priest,
a sorcerer?

332
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,137
Just a seeker after the truth.

333
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,597
You would never understand.

334
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,392
- Put him up.

335
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,991
How long is it to climb to the top?

336
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,744
An hour.
Faster coming down.

337
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,455
Take up all the wood we can spare.
And rope.

338
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,622
You stay on the boat.

339
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,751
- You may need me.
- No.

340
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:20,557
The pentangle.
Of course, of course, of course.

341
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,519
This is the place.
The sword.

342
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:30,025
Tiberius must have brought it here.
And the boy will find it!

343
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,737
- Romulus!
- Ambrosinus?

344
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,405
Go to the temple.

345
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,701
Look for your ancestor, Julius Caesar.
There is something he guards for you.

346
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,542
Look under the gaze of Caesar.

347
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,671
Of course, of course, of course.

348
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,809
Under the gaze of Caesar.

349
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,854
I told you to stay in the boat.

350
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,940
You will need my help.

351
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:59,531
Do you know what happens to a soldier
of mine who disobeys an order?

352
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,533
Your men are too slow.

353
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,162
Stay out of sight.

354
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,749
I don't see why you take the risk.

355
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,127
I serve my emperor.

356
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,715
He's your country's ally,
so I am with you.

357
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,384
Where did you learn to fight?

358
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,387
I come from Kerala,
in the south of India.

359
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,765
We were taught to fight
like our forefathers.

360
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,893
It is called Kalaripayattu.

361
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,063
When I was 14,
I was at the seventh level.

362
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,734
- Out of how many?
- Seven

363
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,320
Shall we talk all day or climb?

364
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,231
Julius Caesar.

365
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,625
"One edge to defend,
one to defeat.

366
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,838
In Britannia was I forged to fit
the hand of he who is destined to rule."

367
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,483
I have work for you.

368
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,611
Give me that sword.
Give it to me!

369
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,631
- You?
- Only two to rescue an emperor?

370
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,882
More are coming.

371
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,968
- Caesar!
- The temple!

372
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,679
You can't hide forever!

373
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,768
Yours.

374
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,449
Romulus?

375
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,120
You found the sword, boy.

376
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,998
- Save the emperor.

377
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,750
Caesar's sword.

378
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,087
- It's this way.

379
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,926
Get them away.
Get them away!

380
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,153
I got it.

381
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,864
Batiatus.

382
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,368
Yours.

383
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,792
Go! This way.

384
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,254
Get the boy away.

385
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,710
Roman!

386
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,989
- Where's the boy?
- Safe below with the others.

387
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,900
You were right, Batiatus.
it is guicker on the way down.

388
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,380
"One edge to defend, one to defeat.

389
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:47,261
In Britannia was I forged, to fit
the hand of he who is destined to rule."

390
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,389
Caesar's sword.

391
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,810
That is why it had such power.

392
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,231
Britannia.

393
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,486
Gather the men.

394
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:08,658
Made for a congueror.
Julius Caesar.

395
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,834
Caius Julius Caesar Ensis Caliburnus.

396
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,628
Feel the weight.

397
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,450
The sword carries a prophecy.

398
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,413
Did you see anything?
Anything written?

399
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,710
Then you know all you need to know.

400
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,754
Take it.

401
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,049
It's yours.

402
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,334
Welcome, Caesar.

403
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,545
Aurelius, all of you.

404
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,550
There is food and drink inside the tent.

405
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,054
We need to talk. Alone.

406
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,349
You're safe now.

407
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:01,103
From here you'll be taken to
the Eastern Empire to Constantinople.

408
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,231
You'll have sanctuary.

409
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,225
Uh...

410
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,394
Mmm.

411
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,563
The ambassador has heard
from Constantinopole.

412
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,316
The emperor will not give
sanctuary to the boy.

413
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,445
He will not oppose Odoacer,
nor offend him.

414
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,239
Everything has changed.

415
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,993
The day after you left, the garrison
of Rome swore allegianct to Odoacer.

416
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,578
Now, the rst of the commanders
have declared.

417
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,247
They all stand with the Goth.

418
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,085
There must be others still in the field.
What about the Ninth?

419
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,796
Ninth Legion?
They're to the north in Britannia.

420
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,966
For all we know,
Britannia has crumbled into the sea.

421
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,593
Well, then let's move fast.
Can you get me men?

422
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,472
Yes, you can keep your rank,
command a new army.

423
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,684
Good. Do it. We'll drive out
the invaders, if I can have 5,000.

424
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,020
Not for that, Aurlius.
I can't do that.

425
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,731
Why not? What is it with you, Nestor?

426
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,943
- Odoacer isn't just a barbarian.
- Is he not?

427
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,405
No, he's become a politician.
And a very astute one.

428
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,367
- Now he has the senate on his side.
- How many ofthe senate?

429
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,412
We have to see things as they are.

430
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,625
You're with them.

431
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,797
In time, perhaps,
we can challenge Odoacer. Not now.

432
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:59,138
So let's say you give me
this army, senator.

433
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:03,559
- What will you ask for in return?
- The boy.

434
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,938
You mean Caesar?
"Caesar" is a word from the past.

435
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,398
There is no Caesar.

436
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,573
Prepare the horses.

437
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,034
Where is the boat?

438
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,954
I said, prepare the horses.

439
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,585
Where is the boat to take
the emperor to Constantinopole?

440
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,674
I gave you an order.
What was it?

441
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,639
- Prepare the horses.
- Do it.

442
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:56,487
You are a soidier, Aurelius.
Leave the politics to me.

443
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,699
This is an order.
Give up the boy.

444
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,786
Without the emperor, there is no Rome.

445
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,956
Then you will run like a dog
until they hunt you down.

446
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,129
Commander!

447
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:23,722
- There he is! There's the boy!
- The boy! Get the boy!

448
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,769
Stop, comrades! We're all Romans!

449
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,510
Ah!

450
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,783
Vatrenus.

451
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:52,311
You don't understand,
Aurelius. I had to do it.

452
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,569
Aurelius, my friend,
if you ever loved me...

453
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,824
- For friendship.

454
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,841
Now that the Eastern Empire
has gone over to the Goths,

455
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:28,889
we have no refuge in Constantinople.
Or here. Or in Germania.

456
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,476
Where do we go, then?

457
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,398
The Ninth Legion is in Britannia.

458
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:41,610
it's the only way left to us.
North, to find them.

459
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,699
This is not your fight.

460
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,993
You're free to go.

461
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,705
Go? Where should I go?

462
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:58,919
I have broken my sacred oath,
killed my commander. I'm like you.

463
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,171
I have no country now.

464
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,677
My road is your road.

465
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:11,849
Commander, where we go
is not your decision to make.

466
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,226
Caesar?

467
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,699
We go north... to Britannia.

468
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,537
Beyond that peak is Gaul.

469
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,499
By the next full moon,
we'll be in sight of Britannia.

470
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,905
My beloved Britannia.

471
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:33,323
Nobody alive, commander.
There are horses here.

472
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:39,204
After all these years,
it's still happening.

473
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,664
Who could have done this?

474
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:45,043
Only one man.
His name is Vortgyn.

475
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,905
- What is this?
- Hadrian's Wall.

476
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,781
Last fortress of the empire.

477
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,784
A monument to Roman law and order.

478
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,037
The Ninth legion.
We've found them.

479
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:50,108
Look, the dragon.
They were here once.

480
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,902
So where are the Ninth, old man?

481
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,447
This is your country.
What has happened here?

482
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:04,206
This is where
the empire ends, Demetrius.

483
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,458
There's nothing left but this wall.

484
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,003
We came all this way
for a legion of ghosts.

485
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,675
We should have made our stand in Rome.

486
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:23,183
It would have been hopeless.
He must know.

487
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,144
Ah, he's fought
hopeIess battles before.

488
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,356
And you'd have stood by him?

489
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,740
Anytime, anywhere.

490
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:05,017
- They look like farmers.
- Who are you?

491
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,978
I'm Aurelianus Antonius
of the Nova Invicta.

492
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,521
These are my men.

493
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:13,150
I'm Kustennin.
These are mine.

494
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,737
I'm looking for the Ninth Legion
of the Roman Army.

495
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,573
Why do you come so far for them?

496
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,326
Rome has fallen.

497
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,412
What happened here?

498
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,373
The Dragon Legion is no more.

499
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,879
They were more than a thousand strong.
Who could have defeated them?

500
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,883
Kustennin, where are my countrymen?

501
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,095
Commander,
I am Flavius Konstantinus Marcellus...

502
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,056
...general of the Ninth Legion.

503
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,894
Rome abandoned us.

504
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:53,106
Some men left to fight in Gaul.
Those with families stayed here.

505
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,942
Now, you see, we live like celts.

506
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,445
We have a whole new generation.

507
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,657
We saw villages destroyed.
People slaughtered.

508
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,867
Vortgyn, King of Anglia.

509
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,913
He's taken the southern kingdoms,
and now he wants to ruIe all Britannia.

510
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:13,126
He's left us in peace so far.
We are no threat to him.

511
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:17,631
And he knows
we are no ordinary farmers. Come.

512
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:33,772
We bring greetings to Lord Vortgyn,
congueror of the Anglian people.

513
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,609
Righftul ruler of Britannia.

514
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,283
There is a boy.

515
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,079
- A boy?
- He carries a sword.

516
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,498
The sword carries a prophecy.

517
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,251
"One edge to defend, one to defeat.

518
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,962
In Britannia was I forged,
to fit the hand of..."

519
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,339
"He who is destined to rule."

520
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,469
You know of this?

521
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,973
You say a boy has it?
Where is this boy?

522
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,558
Here, in Britannia.

523
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,062
I've waited all my life for this.

524
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,317
Lord Vortgyn, the sword belongs...

525
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:23,029
"To the hand of he
who is destined to rule."

526
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:30,203
This is the hand.

527
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:36,168
Then I take the boy.
And the man who travels with him.

528
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,172
This man.

529
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,178
Tell me about the man.

530
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:49,473
He is the boy's teacher.
Acts like a priest.

531
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,351
He is not Roman.
Maybe from Gaul, or here in Britannia.

532
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,729
He has a scar here
in the shape of a sword.

533
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,693
- Like this?
- The same.

534
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,034
When I have the sword...

535
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,621
...I will make you a gift of the boy.

536
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,498
And the man?

537
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,919
The man is mine.

538
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:27,302
This blade was forged
from a flaming stone

539
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,388
that fell to earth from the stars.

540
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:34,226
Who has ever seen such a thing
in the dark ofthe sky at night?

541
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:39,189
Then you will know, and you will know,
and you will know, and you will know,

542
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,732
that what I tell you is true.

543
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:44,569
This stone offire that fell to earth,

544
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:48,657
cooled in the ice of a mountain
and turned to iron.

545
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:53,203
There, it was found
by a master blacksmith, a Calibian.

546
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:56,790
He hammerd the metal in his furnace
for three days and three nights,

547
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:01,336
hammering in the white heat, with no
stop, not so much as to eat or drink.

548
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:07,467
The cutting edge,
he tempered in the blood of a lion.

549
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:11,429
And see here,
he carved the pentangle,

550
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,766
our symbol of faith and truth.

551
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,017
So...

552
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,479
...whoever held this sword
would have faith

553
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:25,277
and know that it would serve
one cause and one cause onIy.

554
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,322
The truth.

555
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,117
Would you take up arms again?

556
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,161
For the emperor?

557
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:38,957
We swore a sacred oath to defend
our emperor to the death.

558
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,626
But to go against the Goth...

559
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,379
...it would take a miracle.

560
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,057
It's so simple for them.

561
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,769
They like each other,
and they're not afraid to show it.

562
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,611
How do you see me, Aurelius?

563
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,241
You're a fine warrior.

564
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,537
You let your guard drop occasionally.

565
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,497
Careless sometimes.

566
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:26,922
Show me.

567
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,604
Is that all you see me as?
A warrior?

568
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,774
You're a handsome woman,
in your way.

569
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,570
- Such passion, commander.

570
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,281
You must have broken many hearts.

571
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,790
You're getting slow.
Must be age!

572
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,921
You know, your attacks
are a little too predictable.

573
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,057
So where am I open?

574
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:20,850
There.

575
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,527
Not bad.

576
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:37,575
- Do you know this place?
- Once, yes, I knew it well.

577
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,787
This was a sanctuary
for those whose lives

578
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,289
were dedicated to the secret
ofthe sword.

579
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,083
Did you live here, Ambrosinus?

580
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,753
Here I was given this.

581
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,672
By Vortgyn.

582
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,137
Where is it?

583
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,098
He wanted the power
of the sword for himself.

584
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:04,269
But the secret could only be given
to a righteous man.

585
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,480
That moment, so long ago...

586
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,817
...marked the path of both our lives
forever after.

587
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,445
The pentangle.

588
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,905
The same as on sword.

589
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:18,450
Remember the prophecy?

590
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:25,206
"In Britannia was I forged to fit the
hand of he who is destined to rule."

591
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:29,419
I left Britannia in search
ofthe sword. I found you.

592
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,922
I knew then that what was written
must come to pass.

593
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:38,678
But I am Caesar without an empire.
How can I fulfil the prophecy?

594
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,056
Have I taught you nothing?

595
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:46,019
Prophecy is an act of faith.
And we are the keepers ofthe faith.

596
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:52,150
What do you think, Aurelius?

597
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,278
Would you bury your sword for this?

598
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,740
To have a home. Keep cattle.

599
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,409
Grow fat.

600
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:05,830
When it's over...

601
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:09,250
...maybe then.

602
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,547
I'm coid.

603
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:53,962
Well, little one...

604
01:08:56,715 --> 01:09:00,260
...I want you to go back to your people.

605
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,513
carry a message for me.

606
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,016
You have a friend who comes
from a distant land.

607
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,645
They must give him up.

608
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:12,856
Look.

609
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:30,415
- Ygraine?
- Ygraine?

610
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,342
The blacksmith's family.

611
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,389
This is Vortgyn at work.

612
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:49,100
- Oh, please, not me, don't kill me!
- No, no, no.

613
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,144
- They won't kill you.

614
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:55,398
Oh, yes, they will. They'll kill us all!
Unless we give them...

615
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:59,444
...him.

616
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:04,991
Romulus?

617
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,703
Lovely Romulus.

618
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,632
The boy.

619
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:23,968
He is the one.

620
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,138
He is Romulus Augustus Caesar.

621
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,024
Why us, Aurelius?
Why did you come to us?

622
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,585
I lost my wife...

623
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,005
...and two sons today.

624
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:02,882
And I want revenge.

625
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,844
But the bitter truth is...

626
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:11,933
...if we stand against Vortgyn,
many more will die.

627
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,646
Perhaps all of us and our families.

628
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,856
That's not revenge, that's suicide.

629
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,110
The boy should go.

630
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,488
- And those who came with him.
- It's not our fight.

631
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:33,538
- Let us hear Aurelius.
- i will speak for him.

632
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:46,009
Everything you have been told is true.

633
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:48,886
I am Caesar.

634
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:55,518
We came asking for your loyalty
but Rome has not been loyal to you.

635
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,813
Now, if it is the right path,
and if it will save more lives,

636
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,773
then I will surrender to Vortgyn.

637
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:08,656
Whatever is decided here
will be my destiny.

638
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:11,659
What are we doing?
This is our emperor.

639
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:15,663
One day will decide this.
One final battle.

640
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:20,460
At dawn, I leave for the fort with
my men to fight and defend from there.

641
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:24,005
Those ofyou who will stand with us,
we welcome you as brothers.

642
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:28,134
Those who will not,
we leave you aIso as brothers.

643
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,928
I salute you all.

644
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:35,183
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!

645
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,651
You kept your armour
after all these years?

646
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,780
Ten years a farmer gives you
something worth fighting for.

647
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:52,950
Twenty years a legionary
teaches you to be ready for the day.

648
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:54,994
Good man.

649
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,712
- It was made for my brother.
- Doesn't he need it?

650
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,131
He's grown since then.

651
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,580
If we all die tomorrow, Ambrosinus,

652
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,791
what happens to the prophecy?

653
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:47,088
Now is the test of our faith,
and we are the keepers of the faith.

654
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,844
We keep the flame alive.

655
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:57,640
What happens after is not ours to know.

656
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,829
If we don't live to see tomorrow...

657
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,584
Nothing will ever part us.

658
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:10,338
Commander!

659
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,517
A boy once took your sword.

660
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,899
What if he now offered you his
in exchange?

661
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,486
I would use it well...

662
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,656
...and salute the Caesar
to whom it belongs.

663
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,875
You are Caesar.

664
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:51,045
Wherever you are...

665
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:55,091
...always remember.

666
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:27,081
My friends...

667
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,334
...we've all seen many mornings
Iike this one.

668
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:34,880
Together, we've watched the sunrise and
not known if that day would be our last.

669
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:39,176
Some comrades I've seen
scarctly out of boyhood,

670
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:43,180
- trembling before their first battle.
- It was a cold morning, commander.

671
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:45,182
That it was, Demetrius.

672
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:48,936
And you men ofthe Ninth Legion,
all of us,

673
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:52,148
together we have fought
all our lives for the empire

674
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:55,192
that our ancestors created,
and together we have watched

675
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,986
that empire crumble to dust.

676
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:03,117
And with its fall,
we have lost true friends.

677
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:07,288
And I can tell you that
in the darkest moments,

678
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:10,541
I came to believe that there was
nothing left to fight for.

679
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,419
But I've been shown,
through the wisdom of others,

680
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:15,880
that there is one more battle
to be waged.

681
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:20,468
Against tyranny and the slaughter
of innoctnts.

682
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:24,388
Let us defend to the last breath
this island of Britannia

683
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:27,224
against those who would tear out
its heart and soul.

684
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:32,104
And then those who come after us will
remember that there was such a thing...

685
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:35,775
...as a Roman soldier with a Roman sword
and a Roman heart!

686
01:17:35,942 --> 01:17:38,527
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!

687
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,864
- Demetrius!
- Commander!

688
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:48,287
- Secure the gate!

689
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:03,552
- How many?
- A thousand. Maybe more.

690
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,970
Not as many as I thought.

691
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:12,311
You two man the walls.
Tertius, command the archers.

692
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,522
Watch to the south, sentries!

693
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:18,776
To the ramparts!
One man every five paces!

694
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:20,319
Archers!

695
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:32,581
- Attack!

696
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:43,718
Aim! Loose!

697
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,477
Vortgyn, I give you...

698
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:55,938
...fire!

699
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,155
Aim! Loose!

700
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,335
Sorcerer!
They have a sorcerer!

701
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:19,754
Fire!

702
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:25,426
That is no sorcerer.
That is the keeper of the sword.

703
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:42,610
Stay close to me.

704
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,447
Repel those ladders!

705
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:49,909
The gate won't hold!
Watch out!

706
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:33,786
- Demetrius!

707
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,543
Ahh!

708
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:50,469
Ahh!

709
01:20:57,602 --> 01:20:59,979
Bring me Caesar's sword!

710
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,119
No!

711
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:08,172
- I thought... I thought I had them.
- Too many, old friend.

712
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,841
We don't have a chance.

713
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,403
They're coming.

714
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:53,968
The Ninth. Now we have a fight.

715
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:07,106
- To the last breath.

716
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,069
Form testudo!

717
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,575
Archers!

718
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:23,831
Prepare! Loose!

719
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:22,783
Romulus.

720
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,493
Romulus?

721
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:41,051
For all you've done
to my country...

722
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:42,636
...my Britannia.

723
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:45,430
- Burn in hell!

724
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,067
Behold!

725
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:05,284
The tyrant Vortgyn, he's dead!

726
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:11,915
Retreat! Retreat! Fall back!

727
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,295
Vortgyn is dead!

728
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,056
Romulus?

729
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:31,101
Romulus!

730
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,135
That's for my mother.

731
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:32,639
And my father.

732
01:28:58,541 --> 01:28:59,583
Aurelius.

733
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,590
Aurelius, stay.

734
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:18,268
Stay with us.

735
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,654
You fought like a dragon.

736
01:29:30,823 --> 01:29:33,116
And you fought like the son of a dragon.

737
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:47,964
You once swore to defend me.

738
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:50,926
To the last breath.

739
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:53,762
Have I discharged you from that oath?

740
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:59,851
Then live, Aurelius Antonius.

741
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,266
And all ofyou,
the last of my legions...

742
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,061
...you won a great victory today.

743
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,064
And now I say...

744
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:48,567
...no more blood.

745
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,072
No more war!

746
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,939
And that was how
the last of the Romans

747
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:30,233
found a home here in Britannia

748
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:35,155
and how, after years of turmoil,
they brought peace to the land.

749
01:31:36,365 --> 01:31:39,159
What happened to the commander,
Aurelius?

750
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,203
Oh, he lived.

751
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:44,206
He took the warrior maiden,
Mira, for his wife.

752
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,876
- And Romulus, the boy?
- They raised him as their own son.

753
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:50,670
He grew to be a wise ruler.

754
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:55,842
He took a celtic name,
"Son of a Dragon."

755
01:31:56,010 --> 01:32:00,055
- Pendragon.
- Pendragon. That's my father.

756
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:03,141
And you remember the little girl,
Ygraine?

757
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:05,602
- He married her.
- My mother?

758
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:10,232
And Ambrosinus took back
his real name.

759
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:14,069
- Merlin.
- You?

760
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:18,323
Merlin, it's just a story.
You made it up. It's a legend.

761
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:22,702
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur,
have I ever lied to you?

762
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,329
Every day.

763
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:37,342
That's it. That's where
the last legion made their stand.

764
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:46,059
Great legends were made here.

765
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:49,104
With you as the hero.

766
01:32:50,022 --> 01:32:51,439
Of course.

767
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:08,498
We need heroes, don't we?
