00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:18,630
I mean, I know a lot of kids who play
piano or whatever, but you guys...

164
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,307
You guys rock.

165
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,899
Well, I knew
I personally rocked,

166
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:25,570
but I never suspected
that we rocked as a unit.

167
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:26,805
So, thank you, Knives.

168
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,144
I mean, you guys
are gonna be huge.

169
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,982
Well, we're already
pretty big,

170
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:32,575
but, yeah, I guess
it'd be cool

171
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,882
if cool people started wearing
our T-shirt or whatever.

172
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:36,684
Cool.
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:40,090
Excuse me, do you have anything
by The Clash at Demonhead?

174
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,596
Have you tried the section
marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?

175
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:45,130
Thank you, Julie.

176
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:46,755
Are you coming
to my party Friday,

177
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,700
or will you be
busy babysitting?

178
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,465
Thank you, Julie.

179
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,097
You don't want
to listen to her.

180
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,974
And you definitely don't
want to listen to them.

181
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,738
Oh, I heart them so much.

182
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:02,339
Yeah, I hearted them, too, until
they signed to a major labeI,

183
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,147
and the lead singer turned into a
total bitch and ruined my life forever.

184
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,743
But that's just me.

185
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:11,257
Envy Adams is so cool.
Do you read her blog?

186
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:12,882
Sorry, you were
saying about me?

187
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,894
I mean, I've never gone
out with anyone so talented.

188
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,289
Go out with
a lot of guys?

189
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:18,353
No.

190
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,760
Yeah, so, whatever, man.

191
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,699
I've never even
kissed a guy.

192
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,734
Hey,

193
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,770
me, neither.

194
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:43,419
Here you go.

195
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,855
So, this is
your secret lair?

196
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:46,654
Yeah, yeah.
Can I come in?

197
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,720
My secret lair
is one of those

198
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:51,559
"No girls allowed"- type
deals.

199
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:52,890
Okay.

200
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:54,456
But do you wanna see the
house where I grew up?

201
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:56,126
Sure!
Come on.

202
00:09:58,371 --> 00:09:59,395
There you go.

203
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,204
Wow.

204
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:03,565
Yeah.

205
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:05,908
Wow.

206
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:14,920
Oh, God.

207
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:19,184
So alone.

208
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:22,226
You're not alone.

209
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:23,724
What?

210
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:26,527
You're just having
some idiotic dream.

211
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,195
Does that mean
we can make out?

212
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,066
Oh, God!

213
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:32,161
What is it, Scott?

214
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,399
I had this
totally weird dream.

215
00:10:33,473 --> 00:10:34,701
Oh, God.

216
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:36,002
What is it,
Other Scott?

217
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:39,407
Can we skip the dreamtime?
Color me not interested.

218
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,741
But there was this girl.

219
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:42,143
Girt?

220
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,705
Was this
an Envy-related dream?

221
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,375
We don't use
the E-word in this house.

222
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:48,512
No, it wasn't her.
It was somebody new.

223
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,579
Yay for that.

224
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:51,851
Speaking of new,

225
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,825
weren't you supposed to take
your fake high-school girlfriend

226
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:55,486
to the library
a half-hour ago?

227
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,059
What? It's like 6:00
in the morning.

228
00:10:58,698 --> 00:10:59,824
(SCREAMS)

229
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,259
MAN: Shh!

230
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:03,933
It's weird.

231
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,562
What's weird?

232
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,403
Libraries remind me
of grade school.

233
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,909
That must seem like
a really long time ago.

234
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:13,605
Yeah, let's talk
about something else.

235
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,196
Do you know that girl?

236
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,202
Scott!
What?

237
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:40,071
You only played one note
for that entire song.

238
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:42,166
My hand slipped.

239
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,971
Is your girlfriend
distracting you?

240
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,839
My girlfriend?

241
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,243
I'll be quieter.

242
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:49,609
Let's do that one again.

243
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:50,977
Sorry, what are we doing?

244
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:52,382
I told you, like, 50 times!

245
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,283
We're going
to this party, retard.

246
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:56,515
Party?
At Julie's.

247
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,614
I thought
you guys split up.

248
00:11:57,691 --> 00:12:00,159
We did, but there might be some
labeI guys there, so, you know...

249
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:02,126
Oh, man, this is gonna suck. Suck!

250
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:04,356
At least it'll give us
something to complain about.

251
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:05,523
Oh, man!

252
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,725
This sucks!

253
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,892
Sucks!

254
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:10,994
I'm gonna go pee
due to boredom.

255
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:13,572
I have to pee.

256
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,232
You know, so I told him
you've got a really good sound,

257
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:16,775
and I think that you
should market your sound

258
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:19,334
to deaf people, because... Scott! Hey!

259
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:20,401
Hey, Comeau.

260
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,311
How about this party? You
getting your drink on here?

261
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:24,213
No, I don't drink.
This is just Coke Zero.

262
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,581
What do you mean,
you don't drink?

263
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:28,018
I distinctly remember you being very
drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...

264
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:29,453
Hey, Comeau,
you know everyone, right?

265
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:31,581
Yeah, pretty much, I do.

266
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:33,348
You know this one girl
with hair like this?

267
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:34,859
Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.

268
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,919
Somebody said she was gonna
be here tonight, actually.

269
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,294
What?
Oh, Scott.

270
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,492
You have the hots for her or
something? I gotta tell you though,

271
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,000
I hear that she's
a little hardcore.

272
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:05,847
(ALL CHATTERING)

273
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:25,040
Hey, what's up?

274
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:26,467
Nothing.

275
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:27,877
<i>Hey, you know Pac-Man?</i>

276
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:29,437
I know of him.

277
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:33,083
<i>Well, Pac-Man was
originally called Puck-Man.</i>

278
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,681
They changed it because...

279
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,882
Not because Pac-Man looks
like a hockey puck.

280
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:40,391
<i>"Paku-paku" means
"flap your mouth,"</i>

281
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,020
and that they were afraid
people would change...

282
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:46,896
Scratch out the "P" and
turn it into an "F," like...

283
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,032
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

284
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:50,763
Yeah, that's amazing.

285
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:52,326
Um...

286
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,700
Am I dreaming?

287
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:58,767
I'll leave you alone
forever now.

288
00:13:58,845 --> 00:13:59,903
Thanks.

289
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,444
Dude!
What?

290
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:09,783
She's totally reaI!
Who?

291
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,414
Ramona Flowers.
What?

292
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:13,550
Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?

293
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,287
AII I know is
that she is American.

294
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,419
American.

295
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:17,929
Why don't you go talk
to Sandra and Monique?

296
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,055
They know a lot more.

297
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:21,259
Lady-dudes. What do you
know about Ramona Flowers?

298
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,631
I heard she has
a boyfriend.

299
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:24,101
Yeah. Some guy
back in New York.

300
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:25,895
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What else?

301
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:28,406
I heard she kicks
all kinds of ass.

302
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:31,000
She's on another leveI.

303
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:32,977
She has men
dying at her feet.

304
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,674
She's got some
battle scars, dude.

305
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:37,272
What about Ramona Flowers?

306
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,339
You know her?
Tell me now.

307
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:39,407
She just moved here.

308
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:41,044
Got a job at Amazon.
Comes into my work.

309
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:42,110
Does she really?

310
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:43,849
Didn't you say she just
broke up with someone?

311
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:44,981
Did she really?

312
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,320
They had a huge fight,
or whatever.

313
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:47,381
Did they really?

314
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,860
Yes! But I didn't want Scott
to know that, Stephen.

315
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,897
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

316
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:54,160
Scott, I forbid you
from hitting on Ramona,

317
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,361
even if you haven't had a
reaI girlfriend in over a year.

318
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:57,460
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

319
00:14:57,537 --> 00:15:00,665
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's
mourning period is officially over.

320
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,699
He's totally dating
a high-schooler.

321
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,744
Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.

322
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:05,971

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,613
I've lived here forever, so there are
reasons for you to hang out with me.

482
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,553
You want me to
hang out with you?

483
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,714
Yeah, if that's cool.

484
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:29,059
If I say yes, will you sign
for your damn package?

485
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:31,961
So, yeah, 8:00?

486
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:37,061
Why are you just
standing there?

487
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:39,237
Dude, I'm totally
waiting on you.

488
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:41,796
I'm sorry, I just assumed you
were too cool to be here on time.

489
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,705
Oh, you assumed wrong.

490
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:47,107
So, how did you
end up in Toronto?

491
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,511
Just needed
to escape, I guess.

492
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:49,979
Yeah.

493
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,676
I got this job here,
and Gideon had always said

494
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:54,242
Toronto was one of
the great cities, so...

495
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,345
Is Gideon your boyfriend?

496
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:59,419
He's a friend.

497
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,188
Was he your boyfriend?

498
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:04,723
Do you mind if I don't
get into that right now?

499
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:07,163
It's so not
interesting to me.

500
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:09,999
So, what about you?
What do you do?

501
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,094
I'm in between jobs
at the moment.

502
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:14,263
Between what and what?

503
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,437
Well, my last job was a
long story filled with sighs.

504
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,642
I know plenty of those.

505
00:22:21,714 --> 00:22:22,976
Is that why you
left New York?

506
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,641
Pretty much.

507
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:26,742
It was just time to head
somewhere a little more chilled.

508
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:28,947
Well, it's certainly
chilled here.

509
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,215
Yeah.

510
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,621
It's chilled, as in cold.

511
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,154
Yeah.

512
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:39,622
This is ridiculous.
Isn't it, like, ApriI?

513
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:40,791
I know.

514
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,834
I can barely see you.

515
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,598
This whole thing is
an unmitigated disaster.

516
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:49,505
I think act of God is a pretty
decent excuse for a lousy date.

517
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:51,440
So this is a date, eh?

518
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:53,477
Did I say date?

519
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,470
Slip of the tongue.

520
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,106
Tongue.

521
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:59,708
Anyway,
night's not over yet.

522
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:01,719
I think there's a thingy
over here, somewhere.

523
00:23:01,787 --> 00:23:02,811
A thingy?

524
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,518
A door.

525
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:10,056
Come on.

526
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:27,007
What kind of tea
do you want?

527
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:28,575
There's more
than one kind?

528
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:32,340
We have blueberry, raspberry,
ginseng, Sleepytime,

529
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:33,544
green tea,
green tea with lemon,

530
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,143
green tea with lemon and
honey, liver disaster,

531
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:36,552
ginger with honey,
ginger without honey,

532
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,590
vanilla-almond, white
truffle, blueberry-chamomile,

vanilla-walnut,
Constant Comment

534

and EarI Grey.

535
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:44,462
Did you make
some of those up?

536
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,964
I think I'll have
Sleepytime.

537
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:48,632
That sounds good to me.

538
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:51,929
Let me get you a blanket.

539
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,206
That would
actually be awesome.

540

541
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:07,011
Dude, I'm changing.

542
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,883
Sorry. I'm just cold.

543
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:12,014
Here, does that help?

544
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:14,753
Yeah, that's very warm.
What is that?

545
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,528
Okay.

546
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,747
Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?

547
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:38,078
I guess.

548
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,712
Maybe we should both get
under it, since we're so cold.

549
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:46,047
What about our tea?

550
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:49,326
I can

551
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,126
not have tea.

552
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:01,664
I changed my mind.

553
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:04,369
Changed it to what?
From what?

554
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:07,935
I don't wanna have sex with
you, Pilgrim. Not right now.

555
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:09,844
Okay.

556
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:12,213
It's not like I'm gonna send you
home in a snowstorm or anything.

557
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:13,808
You can sleep in my bed.

558
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:16,787
And I reserve the right to change
my mind about the sex later.

559
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:20,451
Well, this is nice.
Just this.

560
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:22,994
It's been, like,
a really long time,

561
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:25,496
so I think I needed this,
whatever it is,

562
00:25:25,564 --> 00:25:27,657
so thank you.

563
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:31,502
You're welcome.

SCOTT: Hey, so, can this
not be a one-night stand?

565
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:40,739
For one thing, I didn't even
get any. That was a joke.

566
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:42,941
What did you
have in mind?

567
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:46,016
Come to the first round of
this Battle of the Bands thing.

568
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:47,313
You have a band?

569
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:48,683
Yeah, we're terrible.
Please, come?

570
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:50,652
(SIGHS) Sure.

571

Oh! Wait. Can I get
your number?

572
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:57,462
Wow. GirI number.

573
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,027
See you at the show,
Scott Pilgrim.

574

This is Wallace, his roommate. Hey.

Well, I...

587
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:51,575
Have to go.

God! This is a nightmare.

Is this a nightmare?
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

Once we're on stage,
you'll be fine.

593
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:12,237
We were just on stage for sound
check, and the sound guy hated us.

594
00:27:12,304 --> 00:27:15,535
It's just nerves.
Pre-show jitters.

595
00:27:15,608 --> 00:27:16,768

This is so, so bad.

Hey, Jimmy,
do they rock or suck?

599

started playing yet.

He's a friend.

It's hard for me
to keep track sometimes,

so many friends.

Do you mind if we don't
get into it right now?

1226

She wanted to move
to Montreal,

1227
00:57:30,688 --> 00:57:32,121
because she missed
her best friend.

the past come back to haunt you.

Is it wrong that I try
not to think about it?

to think about?

Oh.

1237
00:57:54,044 --> 00:57:56,808
And you didn't bang her?
Are you gay?

1238

about my stupid ex-girlfriend.

1240

Scott, just because Envy is back
in town doesn't make it not over.

1241
00:58:05,656 --> 00:58:07,715
Double negative.
It's tricky.

1242
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,691
It's over. Move on.

1244
00:58:10,828 --> 00:58:13,524
Right. I'm not going
to let her toy with me.

1245
00:58:13,831 --> 00:58:15,890
From this moment on,

1246
00:58:15,966 --> 00:58:18,730
I will think of
Envy Adams no more!

1247
00:58:20,137 --> 00:58:21,331
I have distressing news.

1248
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:24,374
Is it news that we suck, because
I really don't think I can take it.

1249
00:58:24,441 --> 00:58:27,467
No. The Clash at Demonhead are
doing a secret show tomorrow night

1250
00:58:27,544 --> 00:58:29,637
and Envy asked us
to open for them.

1251
00:58:29,713 --> 00:58:30,771
I hate you.

1252

A gig is a gig,
is a gig, is a gig.

1253
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:34,482
Maybe you can put
your history aside

1254
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:36,382
until we get through
this thing, for the band.

1255
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,449

Can't we do our...
For the band?

1257
00:58:39,957 --> 00:58:41,117
Can't we do our
own secret shows?

1258
00:58:41,191 --> 00:58:42,886
All our shows
are secret shows.

1259
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,129
We're doing it.
G- Man might be there.

1260
00:58:46,196 --> 00:58:48,096
We play the next round
of the battle on Tuesday.

1261
00:58:48,165 --> 00:58:51,532
We have to get some buzz
going. We need groundswell.

1262
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:53,126
We need stalkers.

1263

What would you do
if your ex was in a band

1264
00:59:02,112 --> 00:59:03,807
and they wanted you
to open for them?

1265
00:59:04,014 --> 00:59:05,709
If my ex was in a band?

1266
00:59:05,783 --> 00:59:06,772
Mmm-hmm.

1267
00:59:07,384 --> 00:59:08,874
Might be a little
awkward, but maybe

1268
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:10,613
it's the grown-up
thing to do.

1269
00:59:10,921 --> 00:59:13,549
Yeah. We're all

I hate her stupid guts!

1273

old. She's probably, like, 25!

She's just some fat-ass
white girl, you know?

1275
00:59:28,605 --> 00:59:30,539
I think you mentioned
she was fat.

1276
00:59:30,607 --> 00:59:31,938
She's got a head start.

We have unfinished business,
I and he.

1439
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:03,921
He and me.

1440
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:05,484
Don't you talk to me
about grammar.

1441
01:07:05,562 --> 01:07:07,462
<i>I dislike you, capisce?</i>

1442
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,259
Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.

1443
01:07:09,332 --> 01:07:10,424
What?

1444
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,990
Because you'll be dust
by Monday.

1445
01:07:12,702 --> 01:07:13,726
Um...

1446
01:07:13,803 --> 01:07:15,862
Because you'll be
pulverized in two seconds.

1447
01:07:15,939 --> 01:07:19,170
And the cleaning lady,
she cleans up dust.

1448
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:21,333
She dusts.

1449
01:07:23,546 --> 01:07:24,945
So, what's on Monday?

1450
01:07:25,982 --> 01:07:30,112
Because it's Friday now. She
has the weekends off, so...

1451
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,654
Monday. Right?

1452
01:07:33,323 --> 01:07:34,688
Basically, you can't
win this fight.

1453
01:07:34,758 --> 01:07:35,918
You're gonna have
to give up this girl,

1454
01:07:35,992 --> 01:07:37,323
because Todd's
gonna kill you.

1455
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:39,627
You used to be so nice!

(SCREAMING)

1457
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:54,901
Scott, we're gonna go
to Pizza Pizza for a slice.

1458
01:07:54,978 --> 01:07:56,411
Call us when you're done.

1459
01:07:56,479 --> 01:07:59,073
He'll be done.
ReaI soon.

1460
01:08:02,485 --> 01:08:05,716
Sounds like someone
wants to get funky.

I can read your thoughts. Your
will is broken. You're through.

1465
01:09:33,476 --> 01:09:35,341
What say we drink
to my memory?

1466
01:09:35,478 --> 01:09:37,378
Fair trade blend
with soy milk?

1467
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:39,881
(SCOFFS) I'm sorry,
but that's pathetic.

1468
01:09:39,949 --> 01:09:41,974
Dude, I can see
in your mind's eye.

1469
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,179
You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees

1470
01:09:44,254 --> 01:09:46,484
in an attempt to
make me break vegan edge.

1471
01:09:46,556 --> 01:09:48,353
I'll take the one with soy.

1472
01:09:51,194 --> 01:09:52,991
Thanks, tooI.

1473
01:09:54,364 --> 01:09:57,595
<i>Actually, muchacho,
I poured the soy in this cup.</i>

1474
01:09:57,667 --> 01:10:00,500
But I thought reaI hard
about pouring it in that cup.

1475
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:03,471
You know, in my mind's eye or whatever.

1476
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,031
What are you talking about?

1477
01:10:06,109 --> 01:10:07,542
You just drank
half-and-half, baby.

1478
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:10,676
Freeze! Vegan police!

1479
01:10:10,747 --> 01:10:11,941
Vegan police!

1480
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:15,542
Todd Ingram, you're under
arrest for veganity violation,

1481
01:10:15,618 --> 01:10:18,849
code number 827,
imbibement of half-and-half.

1482
01:10:19,422 --> 01:10:20,514
That's bullroar!

1483
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:22,524
No vegan diet,
no vegan powers!

1484
01:10:22,592 --> 01:10:24,753
But it's only
my first offense.

1485
01:10:24,828 --> 01:10:25,988
Don't I get three strikes?
I mean...

1486
01:10:26,062 --> 01:10:27,427
Take it.

1487

At 12:27 a. m.
on February 1st,

1488
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:32,331
you knowingly
ingested gelato.

Gelato isn't vegan?

1490
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:35,837
It's milk and eggs, bitch.

1491
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:39,033
On ApriI 4th, 7:30 p. m., you
partook a plate of chicken parmesan.

1492
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,098
(GASPS)

1493
01:10:40,677 --> 01:10:41,871
Chicken isn't vegan?

No. No.

1498
01:11:05,869 --> 01:11:08,269
You once were a vegone,

1499
01:11:08,338 --> 01:11:10,533
but now you will be gone.

1500
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:11,866
Vegone?

1501
01:11:26,823 --> 01:11:28,984
Yeah!
Yeah!

1502
01:11:34,931 --> 01:11:36,922
Sorry, I guess.

1503
01:11:38,134 --> 01:11:39,931
Sorry?

1504
01:11:40,203 --> 01:11:43,468
You just headbutted my
boyfriend so hard he burst.

1505
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:48,136
You kicked my heart in the
ass, so I guess we're even.

1506
01:11:49,612 --> 01:11:51,102
Natalie.

1507
01:11:52,048 --> 01:11:56,280
Natalie? No one
calls me that anymore.

1508
01:11:57,987 --> 01:11:59,079
Maybe they should.

1509
01:12:02,091 --> 01:12:03,820
Let's get out of here.

1510
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:14,302
For the record, I am so
pissed off for you, right now.

1511
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:16,201
Shut the (BLEEP) up, Julie.

1512
01:12:16,272 --> 01:12:17,569
Okay.

1513
01:12:18,741 --> 01:12:20,436
We're still going to
the after-party, right?

1514
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,307
KIM: I'm not sure there's
going to be much of a party.

1515
01:12:22,378 --> 01:12:24,039
I think a third of the band
just went "poom. "

1516
01:12:24,113 --> 01:12:26,775
Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.

1517
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:29,613
Just the desperate people trying
to rub elbows with the labeI guys.

1518
01:12:29,686 --> 01:12:31,654
Then why would we... Oh.

1519
01:12:31,721 --> 01:12:33,814
Neil, you down?

1520
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,187
Scott, you're in, right?

1521
01:12:36,192 --> 01:12:37,318
You wanna go?

1522
01:12:37,393 --> 01:12:40,692
Well, I kind of
almost died back there.

1523
01:12:40,763 --> 01:12:41,821
I'm not saying
I want to go.

1524
01:12:41,965 --> 01:12:43,023
Yeah. We can totally go.

1525
01:12:43,099 --> 01:12:44,123
I'll do whatever
you want to do.

1526
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,189
So, let's go.

1527
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:48,165
RAMONA: We really don't
have to go to this thing.

1528
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,035
It'll probably be
a bad scene all around.

1529
01:12:50,106 --> 01:12:52,631
No, I'm fine.
It's just...

1530
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:54,142
It's just...
Well...

1531
01:12:55,378 --> 01:12:58,438
Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?

1532
01:12:58,514 --> 01:13:00,243
So far,
you're not a total ass.

1533
01:13:00,316 --> 01:13:01,510
But I'm part ass?

1534
01:13:01,584 --> 01:13:03,711
If it makes you feeI better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.

1535
01:13:03,786 --> 01:13:04,810
Wait, is that good?

1536
01:13:04,887 --> 01:13:06,047
It's what I need right now.

1537
01:13:06,122 --> 01:13:07,146
But not later?

1538
01:13:07,223 --> 01:13:09,054
Scott, I don't have
all the answers, okay?

1539
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:11,855
I'd just like to try and
live in the moment if I can.

1540
01:13:11,928 --> 01:13:13,520
I'd just like to live.

1541
01:13:13,963 --> 01:13:15,430
RAMONA: Look, I know
Todd was bad news,

1542
01:13:15,498 --> 01:13:16,931
but are you saying
Envy wasn't?

1543
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,365
We all have baggage.

1544
01:13:18,434 --> 01:13:21,494
Well, my baggage doesn't try
and kill me every five minutes.

1545
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,436
What did you do to make
your ex-boyfriend so insane?

1546
01:13:23,506 --> 01:13:24,837
Exes.
Whatever.

1547
01:13:24,907 --> 01:13:27,068
No breakup is painless,
somebody always gets hurt.

1548
01:13:27,143 --> 01:13:29,703
What about you and that girl,
Knives? Who broke up with who?

1549
01:13:29,779 --> 01:13:32,373
I believe
I broke up with her.

1550
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:33,745
And was she cool with that?

1551
01:13:33,816 --> 01:13:36,307
Knives is with Young Neil now.
She's totally cool with it.

1552
01:13:36,386 --> 01:13:37,375
You sure about that?

1553
01:13:37,453 --> 01:13:39,011
Yeah, she's very mature
for her age.

1554
01:13:39,088 --> 01:13:40,350
We had a very
healthy breakup.

1555
01:13:40,423 --> 01:13:41,617
We're all peaches and gravy.

1556
01:13:41,758 --> 01:13:42,986
KNIVES: (ECHOING) No!

1557
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:44,649
What about you and Kim?

1558
01:13:44,727 --> 01:13:46,888
Me and Kim?
I can barely remember.

1559
01:13:46,963 --> 01:13:48,954
It was high school.
She had freckles.

1560
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:50,223
That's it?

1561
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,292
Yeah, it kind of ended.
We changed.

1562
01:13:53,369 --> 01:13:54,495
That's really
the whole story?

1563
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:56,435
Okay, fine, I had to fight
a guy to be with her. Okay?

1564
01:13:56,506 --> 01:13:59,134
I fought a crazy,
80-foot-tall, purple-suited dude

1565
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:01,335
and I had to fight
96 guys to get to him.

1566
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:04,039
He was flying and shooting
lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?

1567
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:06,547
And I kicked him so hard that he
saw the curvature of the earth.

1568
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:09,050
Does that make
you feeI any better?

1569
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:11,916
Well, now you are being a
total ass. Welcome to the club.

1570
01:14:12,722 --> 01:14:14,952
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

1571
01:14:15,024 --> 01:14:18,551
Hey, don't worry. I don't even
know what I'm like anymore.

1572
01:14:19,462 --> 01:14:22,260
I think this ex-boyfriends
thing is messing with my head.

1573
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:23,731
Exes.
Why do you keep saying that?

<i>SCOTT: The girl from earlier?</i>

1576
01:14:33,576 --> 01:14:35,510
Roxy?
You know this girl?

1577
01:14:35,578 --> 01:14:38,604
Boy, does she know me.

1578
01:14:38,815 --> 01:14:41,010
What is she talking about?

1579
01:14:41,217 --> 01:14:42,809
He really doesn't know?

1580
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,244
Wait.

1581
01:14:46,155 --> 01:14:47,144
Hmm?

1582
01:14:50,059 --> 01:14:52,027
You and her?
It was just a phase.

1583
01:14:52,095 --> 01:14:53,756
Just a phase?
You had a sexy phase?

1584
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:55,320
It meant nothing. I didn't
think it would count.

1585
01:14:55,398 --> 01:14:56,456
It meant nothing?

1586
01:14:56,532 --> 01:14:57,760
I was just
a little bi-curious.

1587
01:14:57,834 --> 01:14:59,392
Well, honey,

1588
01:14:59,469 --> 01:15:02,336
I'm a little bi-furious.

1589
01:15:14,016 --> 01:15:16,109
Do that again
and I will end you.

1590
01:15:16,185 --> 01:15:17,652
Back off, hasbian.

1591
01:15:18,154 --> 01:15:20,622
If Gideon can't have you,
no one can.
