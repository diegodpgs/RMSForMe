1
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,909
Hey, Andy!
What's up, dude?

2
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,119
Hey, Joe. Hey, Sara.
How you doing?

3
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,412
When you going to
get a car?

4
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:04,624
Hey, why don't you get
a car? I can't afford it.

5
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,129
So, Survivor tomorrow
night. We on? See you then.

6
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,006
I'll bring a soda.
Hey, enjoy your orange.

7
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,091
Okay, take care.
See you. Bye-bye.

8
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,638
That guy needs to get laid.
Tell me something I don't know.

9
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,489
Good morning.

10
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,163
Excuse me. Pardon me.

11
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,624
Sorry.

12
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,426
Excuse me.
Thank you.

13
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,265
Good morning.
Hey.

14
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,433
Good morning, Paula.
Andy.

15
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,354
Excuse me.
I have a question.

16
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:13,776
What is the difference between
Hi8 and Digital video tapes?

17
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,445
I'm not a salesman,
so, I could probably...

18
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,240
Welcome to Smart Tech. How
can I be of service to you?

19
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,867
Well, I was just
wondering

20
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,452
what is the difference
between these?

21
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,206
Well, if I'm photographing
someone as fine as yourself

22
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,041
I'd probably go Digital.

23
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:36,090
Hey, don't worry
I've been lied to

24
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,141
My God. Sorry I'm late, man. No problem.

25
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,518
Oh, man.

26
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,605
I had a weekend.
Yeah?

27
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,025
We went to Tijuana, Mexico,
you know,

28
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,028
and we thought it would be fun,
you know, to go to this show.

29
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,405
Everyone's, "You gotta
check out one of these shows. "

30
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,033
And, you know,
it's a woman fucking a horse.

31
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,578
We get there, and, you know,
we think it's gonna be awesome

32
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,040
and it is not as cool as it
sounds like it would be, man.

33
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,584
It's kind of gross.
Yeah.

34
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,336
You think,
"A woman fucking a horse"

35
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,004
and you get there
and it's

36
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,923
a woman fucking a horse.
Yeah.

37
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,008
It was really
giving it to her.

38
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,426
And you know what,

39
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,095
to be honest, I felt bad for
her. We all just felt bad for her.

40
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,889
Yeah. Kind of felt bad for the horse.

41
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,184
Wow, that's something.
So what did you get up to?

42
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,313
You know, I just kind
of hung out. I was...

43
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,273
God, Friday,
when I went home

44
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,609
I really wanted
an egg-salad sandwich.

45
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,694
And I was just obsessing
about it and I was like,

46
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,780
"Man, I'm gonna
make one of those. "

47
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,325
So Saturday I went out and
I got, like, a dozen eggs

48
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,994
and I boiled them all
and then I just,

49
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,039
I spent, I don't know,
probably three hours,

50
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,709
like, three-and-a-half hours
making,

51
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,838
you know, the mayonnaise
and the onions and paprika

52
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,966
and, you know,
all the accoutrement.

53
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,509
And then, by the time
I was done

54
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,177
I just really didn't feel
like eating it.

55
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,846
I can imagine.
And I didn't have any bread.

56
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,725
So, you know, it was pretty
good. It was a good weekend.

57
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,853
Sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, it was fine.

58
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,355
Sounds really fun.

59
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,857
Cool.
Cool.

60
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,359
Cool, cool.

61
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,030
Hey, Paula.
Yeah.

62
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,616
I gotta tell you something.
I'm really excited about it.

63
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,078
For the first time today,
I woke up,

64
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,499
I came to the store, and I
feel confident to say to you

65
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,168
that if you don't take
this Michael McDonald DVD

66
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,629
that you've been playing
for two years straight, off,

67
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,381
I'm going to kill everyone
in the store

68
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,341
and put a bullet
in my brain.

69
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,137
David, what do you suggest we
play? I don't care. Anything.

70
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,181
I would rather watch
Beautician and the Beast.

71
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,851
I would rather listen to
Fran Drescher for eight hours

72
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,686
than have to listen
to Michael McDonald.

73
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,023
Nothing against him, but if I
hear Yah Mo B There one more time

74
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,525
I'm gonna yah mo burn
this place to the ground.

75
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,486
You're such a smart ass.
Get back on the floor.

76
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,948
Fuck you.

77
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,952
This is a great TV.
Nothing beats a plasma.

78
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,620
What are you doing?
That's my customer.

79
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,874
It certainly is not. When I came
upon her, she was unattended.

80
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,625
No, that's my...
Wait.

81
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,753
Go to the checkout there.
Pick up there, please.

82
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,629
She was unattended
because I went to the back

83
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,506
to get the brochure
that she requested.

84
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,050
I apologize,
but it's too late.

85
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,676
The transaction
has been completed.

86
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,470
Then you're gonna give me
half the commission.

87
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,013
You'll receive
none of the commission.

88
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,556
I need to talk to Paula.
This is crazy.

89
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
This is bullshit.

90
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,559
Every time I make a sale,
you go crying to Paula.

91
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,937
How about Jesse Jackson?
Old Jesse needs a cause.

92
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,564
Sick of you poaching
my customers.

93
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,149
I'm sick of your
crybaby bullshit.

94
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,235
You wanna take this shit outside?
Just take it outside and squash it?

95
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,572
Let's stay inside, so everybody
can see what a pussy you have, okay?

96
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,076
Because when I remove the blade
I keep in my boot from its sheath,

97
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,995
I can't return it
until it has spilled blood.

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,332
Look, listen to me. You are
fucking with the wrong nigger.

99
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,336
Hey! You're fucking with
the wrong sand-nigger, okay?

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,922
Dude, I will hang your old ass
by your turban.

101
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,175
Turban now? Do you see
any fucking turban here?

102
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,927
Do I talk like a turban guy?

103
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,888
Do I say, "Hey, Jay, do you want
a Slurpee? You want a Slurpee?"

104
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,183
Fuck you, okay?
I was born in Brooklyn.

105
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,309
Brooklyn, okay?

106
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,979
My accent is a fucking
Brooklyn accent, okay? Okay?

107
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,397
All right, man.
Calm down, dude.

108
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,608
Look, you still covering
my shift on Friday or what?

109
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,611
If I can keep this commission,
with pleasure.

110
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,572
Cool, then. All right, pop.
No problem.

111
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,202
How about Andy?
No.

112
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,121
Come on, man. We need, what, five guys

113
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,705
to play a decent poker
game, right? Yeah.

114
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,332
If we cancel this,
I'm gonna have to go

115
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,334
to some stupid-ass
birthday party with Jill

116
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,669
and that shit
ain't happening.

117
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,212
No.
Why not?

118
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,133
He's a really nice guy and all
but I'm pretty sure that

119
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,551
he is a serial murderer.

120
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,344
Who cares, man?
He's a nice guy.

121
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,721
I just wanna get drunk,
fucked up, and play some cards.

122
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,932
That's great. Look, I don't
wanna end up a lampshade

123
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,017
in some creepy apartment,
that's what I'm saying.

124
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,145
I don't really see
any other options.

125
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,772
Andy. My man.

126
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,608
You got any plans
later on tonight?

127
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,902
Why, do we have to unload
the Sony truck?

128
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,072
No, the guys are getting
together, we're playing some poker

129
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,158
thought, you know,
you'd wanna play.

130
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,701
With you guys?

131
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,746
Yeah, sure.
That would be cool.

132
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,250
You know how to play, right?
Yeah, I play online sometimes.

133
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,627
We're gonna play in the store. Great.

134
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,337
Are we allowed
to do that?

135
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,047
Absolutely not.
Yeah.

136
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,257
Oh.

137
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,426
Well, so I'm gonna
go tell Paula.

138
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,053
I'm just kidding.

139
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,223
I'm kidding. That sounds great.
Cool, I'll see you guys tonight.

140
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,391
Okay.
All right.

141
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,101
Oops.

142
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,980
I almost feel guilty.
No, you don't.

143
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,373
Going down!

144
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,625
Dumbass.

145
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,960
And a full house.

146
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,795
Oh, my dukes!
What?

147
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,256
How much fucking online poker
do you play, dawg?

148
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,384
For like an hour or two a
night, when I'm not playing Halo.

149
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,346
Why did you invite this guy?
He's a fucking ringer, man.

150
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,597
This is hog shit.

151
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,891
You, you're a fucking asshole
to tell me to come here.

152
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,768
You tell me he was a nice guy,
didn't you?

153
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,187
Well, fuck you people,
and fuck you, you and you...

154
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,232
fuck and kiss my big brown
fucking ass, okay?

155
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,691
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

156
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,817
Peace.
All right, man.

157
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,069
Fuck a goat.

158
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,280
Good night.
I love that guy.

159
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,283
Dude, you totally...
Oh, shit, I gotta go. Damn.

160
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,035
About to go see Ellen
in a little bit.

161
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,578
Going now?
Late-night action, huh?

162
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,746
Dude, you know
how it goes.

163
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,290
Does your girlfriend know about
all these late-night visits?

164
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,917
It's like an unspoken
agreement. Yeah.

165
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,087
It's like a completely and
utterly unspoken agreement.

166
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,297
If you knew her, if you knew
who I was dealing with,

167
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,590
you wouldn't be
saying this shit.

168
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,592
There's nothing you can't do
with this woman

169
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,761
straight up and down. I've
done every single thing

170
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,721
I could possibly create.
I've literally lubed up

171
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,140
and made love to the arches
of her feet. All right.

172
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,308
Wow!
Yeah.

173
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,060
Foot fuck!
That's sick, man.

174
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,687
Wow.
That is not sick.

175
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,981
I will give you sick.
Oh, shit.

176
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,858
I was sleeping with a woman
recently, she had the...

177
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,237
Her tits were unbelievable.
Oh, man, I love titties.

178
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,407
And so we're doing it
and I'm about to finish

179
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,492
and her dog starts
licking my ass.

180
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,871
I swear to God, I have to decide,
do I finish or do I stop the dog?

181
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,832
I know your nasty ass.
He finished.

182
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,293
I finished.
And then I stole the dog.

183
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,212
No, I didn't, but...

184
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,965
You know, sometimes,
Amy and I would make love

185
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,134
till it was almost like
we weren't two people

186
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,886
but we were two spirits
or something.

187
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,140
Our souls were connected in
this way, I can't describe it.

188
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,810
Time stood still. It was like
we were sharing the same heart.

189
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,689
Stop, man! Why do you always come
and kill the vibe with those things?

190
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,733
"Sharing the same heart,"
that's like some

191
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,942
Britney Spears shit, man.

192
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,987
This is three grown ass men, don't
nobody want to hear that shit.

193
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,323
Yeah, man, come on, nobody
wants to hear that shit.

194
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,992
Thank you, Andy. Dude,
you broke up two years ago.

195
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,494
You get over it at some
point. Two years, man.

196
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,121
You need to get past that

197
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,416
because no ass is worth
thinking that much about

198
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,001
I always say.

199
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,669
Andy, do me a favor.

200
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,173
Would you please help him redeem
himself by telling a real sex story?

201
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,257
Yes.

202
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,928
I don't... You know what,
I'm a gentleman and I don't...

203
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,805
I don't kiss and tell.

204
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,225
Fuck it, I raise you.
Nastiest shit you've ever done.

205
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,186
I'm talking about nasty.

206
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,438
Wow.

207
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,608
So many stories are running
through my head right now.

208
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
I dated this girl

209
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,366
for a while, and she was
really a nasty freak.

210
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,287
She just loved to get down
with sex all the time.

211
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,915
She was like, any time of day,
she was like,

212
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,751
"Yeah, let's go.
I'm so nasty. "

213
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,127
And I'd be nailing her.

214
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,420
Oh, shit.
She'd be like,

215
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,881
"Oh, you're nailing me. Cool. "

216
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,551
She talk dirty to you?
She loved to dirty-talk.

217
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,429
Totally into it.
She'd be like,

218
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:07,476
"Yeah, let's screw, let's...
I wanna fuck. "

219
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,145
God, it was so dirty.

220
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,691
She'd be like, "Me so horny,
me love you long time. "

221
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,984
So...

222
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,946
So what were the titties like?
Yeah, describe her...

223
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,156
Yeah, she had great tits.

224
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,410
No, I mean, like, detailed.
Did she have, like, you know,

225
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,245
them little pink teeny
nipples. Oh, yeah.

226
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,831
Or like the long
National Geograqhic nipples.

227
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,458
You have like the bumpy Braille
nipples, the Stevie Wonders.

228
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,918
Yeah, they were nice.

229
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,213
You know, when you, like, you
grab a woman's breast and it's...

230
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,757
And you feel it and

231
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,512
it feels like a bag of sand
when you're touching it.

232
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,181
Bag of sand?

233
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,436
You know what I mean.
Why don't we just play?

234
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,187
Why don't you just
deal the cards?

235
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,897
What are you
talking about?

236
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,024
Have you ever felt
a breast before, man?

237
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,109
Yes.

238
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,736
Dude, are you gay?
No, I'm not gay.

239
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,488
I've been with
tons of women.

240
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,532
I touched a guy's balls
at Hebrew school once.

241
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,576
Dude, it's not a big deal.
You like to fuck guys.

242
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,287
I'm cool. I got friends
who fuck guys, in jail.

243
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,705
No, I'm not gay.

244
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,791
No, I've borked a lot of women
in my day.

245
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,001
You've "borked"?

246
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,045
Hold up.
Yo, answer this question,

247
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,384
Are you a virgin?

248
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,803
Yeah, not since I was 10.

249
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,431
It all makes sense.
You're a virgin.

250
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,017
I am... Shut up.
How does that happen?

251
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,518
He's a fucking virgin.

252
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,897
I knew it. That makes so much
sense, man. Look, he's a virgin.

253
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,274
You guys are hilarious. All
right, come on, don't be mean.

254
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,443
I'm not being mean. I'm
trying to help the partner out.

255
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,236
I'm trying to say
I wanna get you laid, dude.

256
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,488
I understand
what's going on.

257
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,407
You guys are so up your asses.

258
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:49,036
From now on, your dick is my
dick. I'm getting you some pussy.

259
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:03,926
A bag of sand! Come on, man!
You could do better than that.

260
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,804
God, me so horny?
Me so stupid!

261
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,437
Oh, come on.

262
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,193
It's gonna be fine.
They don't even remember.

263
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,028
Those guys are cool.

264
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,329
This is gonna be bad.

265
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,123
Yeah, well,
virgin's not a dirty word.

266
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,209
You know what's a dirty word,
is asshole

267
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,794
and that's what you guys are.

268
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,130
You know, I may not have had
sex, but I could fuck you up.

269
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,342
Yeah.

270
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,015
Come on.

271
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,853
Hey, David.
Hey, Andy.

272
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,109
What's up?
Cal, good morning.

273
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,157
Hey, Andy.
Hey.

274
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,159
We're gonna have to get you
some punani.

275
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,082
Andy, it's going down,
partner. We're gonna be...

276
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,753
This for you, partner,
this for you.

277
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,756
Waves of them coming at you
on Friday, Saturday.

278
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,426
By Sunday,
your nuts gonna be drained.

279
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,179
Hey, Andy, don't let him bother
you. It's okay not to have sex.

280
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,640
Not everybody
is a pussy magnet.

281
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,686
What are you? 25?
I'm 40.

282
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,439
Holy shit, man.
You've got to get on that.

283
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,901
Life isn't about sex. Life
is about children and passion.

284
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,194
Yeah.

285
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,363
And spirit.
Yeah, life's about passion.

286
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,991
It's not about fucking
and balls and pussy.

287
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,369
It's about love.
It's about people.

288
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,956
It's about connection.
It's all about connections.

289
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:02,210
It's not about cock and ass
and tits and butthole pleasures.

290
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,004
It's not about
butthole pleasures at all.

291
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,299
It's not about this rusty
trombone and dirty Sanchez.

292
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,385
Please stop.
And Cincinnati bowtie.

293
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:15,307
And your pussy juice cocktail
and this shit-stained balls.

294
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,850
Mooj, just please stop.
Just relax...

295
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,144
All right.
That's enough, party's over.

296
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,313
Let the virgin
get back to work.

297
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,735
Andy!

298
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,404
Andy, come on.
We were just kidding.

299
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,822
Pointless.

300
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,158
Andy, nobody cares
that you're a virgin.

301
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,077
Don't be such a baby.

302
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,537
They were just having fun.
They didn't mean anything.

303
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,414
Get away from me, David.
Wait a minute.

304
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,416
Stop following me!
Hold up.

305
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,838
Hold on. I'm gonna
have to quit my job now.

306
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,173
You don't have to
quit your job.

307
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,050
You know what, I don't wanna
go out with you guys.

308
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,468
Fine.
Okay? I don't need your help.

309
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,012
Okay, fine, you don't have to
go out with us if you don't want.

310
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,723
You know what, I respect
women, I love women.

311
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,435
I respect them so much that I
completely stay away from them.

312
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,896
Okay.
I have a very fulfilling life.

313
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,487
And now, I am making
your silver pants blue.

314
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,490
Get some roadburn, come on!

315
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,951
Come on, sucker!

316
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,371
Now, pretty ladies
around the world

317
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,623
Got a weird thing
to show you

318
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,543
Oh, my God!

319
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,550
Hey, Will and Grace,
back to work.

320
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,802
Hey, Haziz, can you just
give us a second?

321
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,179
We're just kind of
in the middle of something.

322
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,931
I'm on my break, okay?

323
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,434
Fuck off, Haziz.
Leave us alone, all right?

324
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,602
Fuck off? Fuck you!
Fuck you!

325
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,646
Fuck you! Fuck off.
Fuck off.

326
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm gonna kick you
in the nuts, asshole.

327
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,734
Hey, hey! Watch the language,
okay? I have a family.

328
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,902
Watch how you talk to me!

329
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,989
It's a free country, Bambi. I
can smoke out here if I want to.

330
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,323
Smoke my pole.

331
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,701
You are a very unkind man.
Get inside!

332
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,077
This is not professional.

333
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,538
Paula,
this asshole over here...

334
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,331
It's okay.
Paula!

335
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,917
It's all right. Come on.
You know, it's just...

336
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,295
So, how could this
not have happened?

337
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,297
It just never happened.

338
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,134
When I was young, I tried,
and it didn't happen.

339
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,180
And then I got older and I got
more and more nervous

340
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,725
because it hadn't happened
yet. And I got kind of

341
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,353
weirded out about it. Then
it really didn't happen

342
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,648
and then, I don't know,
I just kind of stopped trying.

343
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,359
Do you want to give it
another shot?

344
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,195
Maybe it's too late.

345
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,115
Sometimes I feel that
it is just too late for me.

346
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,493
No, that's crazy.

347
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,537
You're 40 years old.
You know, 40 is the new 20.

348
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,623
You wanna spend the next
60 years of your life

349
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,166
never experiencing sex?

350
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,293
And not just sex, but love

351
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:53,340
and a relationship, and laughing
and cuddling and all that shit.

352
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,300
I don't know.

353
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,679
I wouldn't know what to do.
Look, you gotta take a risk.

354
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,515
You gotta risk it.
Look at me.

355
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,391
I went out with this girl
for four months

356
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,227
and it was the greatest,

357
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,604
greatest thing in my life.

358
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,442
Until she went down on this
guy in an Escalade, I think.

359
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,653
And, you know,
instead of saying,

360
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,697
"Okay, what am I doing
that caused this behavior?"

361
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,616
I dumped her. Stupid decision.

362
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,536
I spent the last two years
of my life regretting it.

363
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,496
Why don't you
get her back right now?

364
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,665
Because she's dating
this pot dealer.

365
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,375
Stupid horrible decision.

366
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,628
But, hey, that's her journey,
you know. I gotta respect that.

367
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,963
I gotta give her the space.

368
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,967
She wants to be some immature
little bitch and blow everybody,

369
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,052
that's love, man.
It sounds horrible.

370
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,263
Of course it's horrible.
It's suffering

371
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,848
and it's pain and it's...
You know, you lose weight

372
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,433
and then you
put back on weight

373
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,602
and then you call them
a bunch of times

374
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,022
and you try and email and then
they move or they change their email

375
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,649
but that's just love.

376
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,026
Do you realize that
this is the first time

377
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,404
we've spoken for more than,
like, 30 seconds?

378
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,572
Uh-huh.

379
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,783
It's kind of nice.
Come out with us this weekend.

380
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,953
No pressure.
We'll just have a good time.

381
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,789
Okay, yeah, I will.
I'll give it a shot.

382
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,873
Great.

383
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,167
But I'm not going to have sex
with anybody.

384
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,962
Good, sex should be
the last thing on your mind.

385
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,851
Logjam. Hi.

386
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,774
Shit.

387
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,529
Oh, God.

388
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,993
Sorry.

389
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,496
See you later.
Thanks for the dance.

390
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,008
I'm okay. It's all right.

391
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,932
Oh, come on, bus!

392
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,858
Oh, come on, dogs!

393
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,905
Shit! You gotta be kidding me.

394
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,883
I mean, I'm kind of nervous.
I never had oral sex before.

395
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:47,013
Jennifer told me how to do it.
It's gonna kick ass.

396
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,146
What are you doing?

397
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,648
Okay, just...
We're almost there.

398
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,151
We have one.
Houston, we have one.

399
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,154
You'll pull my
fucking hair out!

400
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,115
We did it.
God!

401
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,866
Oh, my God,
you came in your pants.

402
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,744
What did you do?
I had some Cream of Wheat.

403
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,580
You know what else is sexy?
What?

404
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,833
Me
Yeah?

405
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,084
Sucking

406
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,004
on your

407
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,589
toe.

408
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,591
That's what you want to suck on? Yeah.

409
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,971
It's just so big and thick.
Okay.

410
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,015
Yeah.

411
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,019
That tickles.

412
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,231
I'm sorry. Oh, no.

413
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,358
Your nose is bleeding.
You think?

414
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,819
I'm sorry.
I'm hot.

415
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,113
But, now,
you can't have any of this.

416
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,824
You should just
give up forever!

417
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,418
Cal, what do you think?
Is this too yellow?

418
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,544
No.

419
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,963
What's Curious George like
in real life?

420
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,256
Come on, man.

421
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,393
Wow, this is
pretty crowded.

422
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,563
Yeah. Well,
it's $9 beer night.

423
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,149
Okay, look now.

424
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,443
So, this is what's about
to happen, all right?

425
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,237
You about to go run down
some drunk chicks, all right?

426
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,740
And don't confuse that with
tipsy. We talking about drunk.

427
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,825
I want vomit in the hair,
bruised-up knees.

428
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,410
A broken heel is a plus.

429
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,995
That's what you
want to find, okay?

430
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,873
No, Dave already told me I
didn't have to have sex tonight.

431
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,957
And now he's gone, so...

432
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,043
Dude, just stop thinking
for a minute, all right?

433
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,753
You ain't got to think
on this one.

434
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,755
All you got to do
is use your instinct.

435
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,256
Show me your instincts.

436
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,092
My head, my heart.
I follow my heart.

437
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,762
Now, I'm gonna show you this
one time, all right?

438
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,598
Instincts.
Show me your instincts.

439
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,392
Show me your instincts.
They're right here.

440
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,520
Own your instincts.

441
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,606
All you doing is using
your instinct. That's it.

442
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,442
That's how a tiger know
he got to tackle a gazelle.

443
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,402
There's a code
written in his DNA.

444
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,196
It says, "Tackle the gazelle. " Okay.

445
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,449
And believe it or not, in every man,
there's a code written that says,

446
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,451
"Tackle drunk bitches. "
No.

447
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:17,038
You know what,
I don't feel comfortable

448
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,542
hitting on drunk "bitches,"
you know.

449
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,793
I don't think that's right.

450
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,044
Okay, hold up.

451
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,964
First of all, you making it out
to be some kind of bad thing.

452
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,466
I didn't use bitches in a
derogatory sense. You did.

453
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,260
It just does...
This doesn't feel right.

454
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,179
Of course it don't feel right. What
has felt right for you didn't work.

455
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,890
You need to try
some wrong, dawg.

456
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,436
Okay, how do I tell
which ones are drunk?

457
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,146
Now you're talking.
All right, check this out.

458
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,023
You see this redhead over here? Where?

459
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,652
With the big old titties. I'm
not gonna stare at a woman.

460
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,363
Dawg, I'm not telling you
to stare at nobody.

461
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,241
I'm telling you to use your
peripherals. Now look at me.

462
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,784
See. Look. See?
Yeah.

463
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,578
I'm not looking at you.

464
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,873
No. I'm looking at...
You're looking at her?

465
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,336
What do you want me to do? I
want you to use your peripherals.

466
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,630
See? I'm not looking at you.

467
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,927
No. See, I'm looking at the redhead
at 3:00 with the big titties.

468
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,014
You see her, racked up
right there, see her?

469
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,932
Yes.
Yeah.

470
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,436
You find one with the peripherals. Okay.

471
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,939
You see, over by the post.

472
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,941
It looks like a...

473
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,735
It's either a ficus...

474
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,570
It might be
a rubber tree plant.

475
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,698
All right, if you're making
a joke, dawg, it's not funny.

476
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,367
I see a blonde
and she's very pretty.

477
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,870
Better, okay. All right.

478
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,997
Now with your peripherals
Yeah.

479
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,541
You got to scope out
a hot, drunk chick.

480
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,043
And then you should
make your move.

481
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,961
Okay? All right.
Yes.

482
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,964
And remember, it's more important
that she's drunk than she's hot.

483
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,467
For this first one. Go get
her. Peripherals, though.

484
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,718
All the way.

485
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,137
All peripherals.

486
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,771
That boy is stubborn.

487
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,944
Hi, I'm Andy.
You look comfortable.

488
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,613
Can I get you
another cocktail?

489
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,822
Too drunk.

490
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,326
But you got the right idea.
But clinically alive.

491
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,454
Hey!
Yo!

492
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,915
I'm having trouble
finding the drunk people.

493
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,250
You want to know where
there's one? Yeah.

494
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:30,171
I. I, Captain Yellowshirts.

495
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,424
Okay. Have a good one.

496
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,717
Yo!
What?

497
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,929
I met a girl and she's here
with a bachelorette party

498
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,056
and they invited us
to party with them.

499
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:43,267
Okay, that's good.
It's so good

500
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,978
because no one is hornier
than a girl

501
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,689
who's about to watch her
friend get married to a guy.

502
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,190
It's so funny.

503
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:57,115
So we just decided because this
is my last night as a free woman

504
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,326
before I marry Dan,
that we would just wig out.

505
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,203
We're wigging out!

506
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,040
You guys are hilarious.

507
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,543
Wait a minute.

508
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,130
Yes, Mr. President. Yes,
the erection results are in.

509
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,217
Hey, guys, look,
it's Dr. Seuss' penis.

510
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,469
I really mean this.

511
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,848
Hey, everybody,
who wants penis cake?

512
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,182
I do.

513
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,561
She does. Hey, you guys, Betty Cocker.

514
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,314
What a good guy. What a...

515
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,358
Dan, the guy
Robin's marrying

516
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,653
is such a good guy.

517
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,321
He sounds like a good guy.

518
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,450
I hated him for like two years
'cause he cheated on me.

519
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:41,951
But...

520
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,622
he's really changed now.

521
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,877
He's a really good guy now.
Your friends seem nice.

522
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,463
You have really kind eyes,
you know that?

523
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,924
Thanks. Your hat
has sequins.

524
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:05,266
Mmm.

525
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,441
Your hands are on my belt.
What?

526
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,526
Your hands are on my belt.
I'm sorry.

527
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,819
It's good.

528
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,988
You're cute.

529
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,240
This is kind of lame.
You wanna get out of here?

530
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,825
Okay, yeah.

531
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,457
Yeah.
Fuck.

532
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,334
Come on.
Okay.

533
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,049
You wanna drive?

534
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,635
I don't have a car
with me here, so...

535
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,595
That's cool, I'll just suck it up.

536
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,723
I'm driving.

537
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:47,892
Are you drunk?

538
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,519
No, I didn't have anything
to drink.

539
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,813
Blow into this?
Okay.

540
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,738
What is this? The judge
recommended I get one.

541
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,832
Whoa, okay. Wow.
That's fast.

542
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,253
Okay.
Come on, you're in the lasso.

543
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,007
? Missy be puttin' it down?

544
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,175
? I'm the hottest round?

545
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,760
? I told y'all
mother-uh?

546
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,011
? Y'all can't
stop me now?

547
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,179
? Listen to me now?

548
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,514
? I'm lastin' 20 rounds?

549
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,057
? And if you want me, people?

550
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,684
? Then come on
get me now?

551
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,647
And Dan's like, "You're
such a B-I-T-C-H, bitch!"

552
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,693
And I'm like,
"You're the bitch, bitch. "

553
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,486
You know?
Yeah.

554
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,280
What was your name again?

555
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,073
Andy.
Andy.

556
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:48,911
Let me tell you something,
Andy. Don't ever be named Dan.

557
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,956
Dan rhymes with man,
and men jerk off.

558
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,499
And he was a jerk-off.

559
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:56,294
Do you know what I mean?
Look out! The car!

560
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,547
Wow.
I like you.

561
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,465
You're not a...

562
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,844
Ugh.

563
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,972
I think I ate some bad
shellfish sandwich or something.

564
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,309
You're cute.
No.

565
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,818
That tasted good.
That tasted like shellfish.

566
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,864
Look out! Sorry.

567
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:26,991
Watch it!

568
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,913
Do you think I'm pretty?
Oh, yes.

569
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,664
Oh, God, yes!

570
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:39,462
You're not looking at me.
Yes, you're pretty.

571
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,215
Do you think I'm pretty?
Look at me.

572
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,343
Look at me!
I'm looking! You're pretty!

573
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,845
God, I just wanna live!

574
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,016
God, I hope
I get my period soon.

575
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,645
I am in a bad mood.
Okay.

576
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,564
I'm so tired.

577
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,691
Hey, whoa!

578
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,278
Oh, God! Turn away!

579
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,781
Hey, get off the wheel.

580
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,077
You're not gonna get in
my pants acting like that.

581
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,703
I'm starving.

582
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:15,498
Let's get some
fucking French toast.

583
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,170
Okay, here we are.
Oh, God, we made it.

584
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,630
Home sweet home.

585
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,591
Oh, mommy!

586
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:33,266
Are you okay? The fucker
came out of nowhere.

587
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,061
Okay. We're okay.

588
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,607
Are you okay?

589
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,402
Well, are you...
What's the matter?

590
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,367
I'm sorry.

591
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,413
That's okay. I think I
kind of had that coming.

592
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,332
I'll still have sex with you
if you want.

593
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,419
You know what, I think I'm gonna
pass on the sex, if you don't mind.

594
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,005
At least I don't have
to work out tomorrow.

595
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,632
Did you have a daiquiri tonight? Yeah.

596
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:07,758
I thought you might.

597
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,677
It was a very bad night.

598
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,680
Yeah, laugh.

599
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,099
You know what, you guys
wouldn't be laughing right now...

600
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,769
if some girl had just vomited
shellfish sandwich into your mouth.

601
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,731
You know what, you're right,
it's my bad.

602
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,816
Let me apologize to you
first of all...

603
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,695
for not mentioning in detail that
when you pick up a drunk woman...

604
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,406
who's falling down
on her way out of the bar...

605
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,367
that you should probably
drive. I drive a bike.

606
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,996
Okay, Mr. Schwinn-fucking-Armstrong,
who asked you to drive a bike?

607
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,206
You know what, I'm not the
only person in the world...

608
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,458
who rides a bike.

609
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,210
Yeah, everyone rides a bike,
when they're fucking six.

610
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,421
Why don't you kiss something?

611
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,632
Because this is over,
you guys, okay?

612
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,384
Can I just interject
for a second?

613
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,844
Let me just say...

614
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,305
you're putting the pussy up
on this pedestal.

615
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,890
You're just building
the pussy up, man.

616
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,391
What are you even
talking about?

617
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,393
"Building the pussy up,"
what does that mean?

618
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:04,190
You making the pussy into this great
big Greek goddess named Pussalia...

619
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,441
and what you're doing is...

620
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,819
you're psyching yourself into
thinking it's some impossible feat.

621
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,237
Yeah, I think
you're right.

622
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,281
I'm putting the pussy up
on a pedestal.

623
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,783
Right.
That's it.

624
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,701
It's "Pussalia," right?

625
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,287
Look where you going. I don't
wanna say the word anymore.

626
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,623
Say what word?
"Pussy. " I don't wanna say it.

627
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,000
Fuck it.
"Pussy" is a scientific word.

628
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,169
Dude! New pants, man.

629
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,796
You know what, Dave?

630
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,340
You know, you said there wasn't
gonna be any pressure at all.

631
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,050
I'm not pressuring you.
Excuse me.

632
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,760
Can one of you guys
help me, please?

633
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,387
No hablo English, lady.

634
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,099
I actually am helping
a customer right now.

635
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,518
Okay, well...
I'm on break.

636
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,145
But our stock supervisor
is very knowledgeable.

637
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,731
He can answer all of your
questions and he'd love to help you.

638
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:46,857
Thank you.

639
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,526
Have a nice day.
You, too.

640
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:53,781
Great, okay. Hi, I'm Trish.
Hi, Andy is my name.

641
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,368
This one looks pretty good.
You don't wanna buy that VCR.

642
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,452
I don't?

643
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,287
No, actually to be
totally honest with you...

644
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,705
you don't wanna buy
any VCR.

645
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,457
It's a dead technology.

646
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,670
It's like getting
an eight-track player.

647
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,131
Yeah.
Or a Betamax.

648
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,299
You know what, actually
I'd recommend this one.

649
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,467
This is a dual.

650
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,637
You've got the VCR
and DVD combo.

651
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,224
So, you know, that technology
would be probably pretty good for...

652
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,642
Six months or so?
Yeah.

653
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,018
That's good.

654
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,062
At best. Sorry.

655
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,565
No.
As good as it gets.

656
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,899
Okay, that sounds good,
then.

657
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,067
Okay, all right.

658
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,319
It's perfect.
Sorry.

659
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,654
Coming through.

660
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,072
Okay.

661
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,867
God, you know, it's so funny,
I work right across the street...

662
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,368
and I've never been
in this place.

663
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,870
Really? Where at?
Yeah.

664
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,581
The "We Sell Your Stuff On eBay" store.

665
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,083
Yes.
And that's the name?

666
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,711
Yeah, I was
looking for something...

667
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,797
you know, obvious.
So I chose that.

668
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,091
I don't understand.
So, what, you do what?

669
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,343
Well, I take the stuff
that you don't want...

670
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,512
and then I "sell" it
on eBay.

671
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,098
But you don't actually
sell anything in the store?

672
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:03,767
No. I don't.

673
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,437
So why do you have a store?

674
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,813
I don't know.

675
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,150
No, I think it's because, you know,
I wanna maybe look professional

676
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,195
and not like a crazy person who's
just gonna steal all your shit.

677
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,614
Sure. I didn't
mean anything by that.

678
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,157
No, it's okay.

679
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,036
You know what, you should come
by sometime if you want, you know

680
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,871
see it for yourself,
check it out.

681
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,539
I'll check out
your empty store.

682
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,834
Yeah, it's the one across
the street that's not empty.

683
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,670
Here's my number. So...

684
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,673
All right.
So, just anytime.

685
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,344
Why do I need your number if
you're across the street, though?

686
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,473
I don't really have a good
answer for that, Andy. I just...

687
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,517
Sorry.
Just giving it to you.

688
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,811
So I'll write you up, and I'll
meet you over at the register.

689
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,563
Okay. And check you out... Check out.

690
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,981
Okay, see you over there.
Okay.

691
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,066
Okay.

692
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,610
Awful chatty.
Hey...

693
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,071
Look, I think she gave me
her number.

694
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,698
She wrote down her number, but
I think she gave me her number.

695
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,116
No, she gave you.
Dude, man.

696
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,785
See, you still mad at me?

697
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,745
No, I was never.
Right, you see what I mean?

698
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,705
Yeah, we gonna
celebrate it, man. Yeah.

699
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,207
This is pretty cool.
Yeah.

700
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,209
Unbelievable. Come on,
give him some credit, man.

701
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,460
The man pulled a number.

702
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,088
It's just... I was in...
I can't believe that happened.

703
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,631
What you did was you zoned in.

704
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,883
Man, she just gave me
her number.

705
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:22,680
That's great, man. I'm telling
you, love is a mysterious fig.

706
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:23,764
It is.

707
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,642
Okay, here's a question.
When should I call her?

708
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,477
You like her?
Yeah.

709
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,020
You definitely
don't want to call her.

710
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,730
When is the next Olympics?

711
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,148
So what you just
got to do is...

712
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,109
just get you a bunch
of these hood rats...

713
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,610
run through them,
just knock them out.

714
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,736
Boom, boom, boom.

715
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,322
And once you've done slayed
like 20, 30 of them hood rats...

716
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,117
now you ready to go up
to the upper echelon type ho.

717
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,202
You know what I mean?
I'm not a big ho runner.

718
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,121
My uncle used to drive
a ho runner.

719
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,039
Screw these analogies.
What he's saying is...

720
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,125
you are going to be so bad
at sex the first time...

721
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,252
you don't want to have sex
with someone you like...

722
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,629
'cause they'll think you're a
weirdo for being so lame at it.

723
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,798
You want to have sex
with hood rats first...

724
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,925
so that by the time you get
to the girl you do like...

725
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,470
you're not terrible at sex,
you'll be mediocre at it.

726
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,264
Probably still
pretty bad, though.

727
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,558
Let's put it up for my man
for pulling that number.

728
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,977
Way to go, man.
Politicked his ass off.

729
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,396
You did politic.
Thanks a lot.

730
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,523
Like a train, round the bend.
You ready?

731
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:49,725
Yeah.

732
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,019
I can't.
Do it.

733
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,729
I can't pee in public.
Gotta do it.

734
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,397
I've got a mental block
about it.

735
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,692
Come on, do it.
I'm shy!

736
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,574
I peed in public!

737
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,202
Let me out. I can't
hear what you're saying.

738
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,829
I don't want to be in here.
It's a soundproof room.

739
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,707
Just learn the techniques.
Right on, man.

740
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,086
You guys, this is not funny!

741
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,326
Hello.

742
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,334
Hey, what you watching?

743
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,545
Dawn of the Dead, man.
Great.

744
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,839
The store is slow.
Paula's gone.

745
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,425
Yo, is Paula back?
No. She's not here.

746
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,677
She said we can't watch
this in here. You sure?

747
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,096
I know. Can I ask you
something in confidence?

748
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,265
I know this is gonna
sound weird.

749
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,434
Am I good-looking?

750
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,185
Do you think a woman
will find me attractive?

751
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,854
Oh, my God!

752
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,399
Oh, my God, the blood just...
Okay, never mind.

753
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,276
Wait, Andy. Hold up.

754
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,320
Listen, this is embarrassing for
me. This is hard to talk about.

755
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,906
Are you ready for my honest answer? Yes.

756
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,743
Yeah. I think you're
a good-looking cat.

757
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,995
I don't think
that anybody knows it...

758
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,663
and I don't think
anybody can see it.

759
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:35,914
Well,
that's why I'm asking you.

760
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,500
You seem really well-groomed
and really put together.

761
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,295
I mean, look, dude. You
think this was an accident?

762
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,131
All of this right here?
Premeditated, partner.

763
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,634
You gotta highlight your attributes,
like a diamond in the rough.

764
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,428
You willing to make
some sacrifices?

765
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,554
Absolutely.

766
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,432
You see that whole Teen Wolf
thing you got going right there?

767
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,350
You need to wax
that right out.

768
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,311
Does it hurt?
No. Waxing don't hurt.

769
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,313
I mean, not unless you're a
bitch. You know what I mean?

770
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,939
It didn't hurt me.
I get it done all the time.

771
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,691
What the fuck!

772
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,238
Fuck that nigger up!

773
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,533
Bitch, get out of the room!

774
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,497
This is gonna be good.

775
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,832
This the one right here,
right? Hi, how are you?

776
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,001
So this is your first time
getting body waxed?

777
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,169
Yes, it is.

778
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,338
Take off your shirt.
Okay.

779
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,676
We're gonna need
more wax.

780
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,095
I'm staying.
This is gonna be good.

781
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,432
And clear all my appointments
in the afternoon.

782
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,017
Here we go.

783
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,685
That feels warm.

784
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,942
I like your sweater.
Does that come in a V-neck?

785
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,779
She starts doing his pubes,
I'm out of here.

786
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,366
You gonna look good
after this, man.

787
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,659
Thanks, man.

788
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,410
So, ready?
Yeah.

789
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,377
You fucker!

790
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:07,089
I'm sorry.
That's just your job.

791
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,634
You want me to stop now?
No. It's okay.

792
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,387
Let's do another one.

793
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,097
That one little patch
looks sexy though.

794
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,224
Does it look good?
Yeah, it looks really good.

795
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,811
It looks man-tastic.

796
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,146
Okay.

797
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,402
Wow! I didn't expect that at
all. I really didn't expect that.

798
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,363
You got it. The first one
is the only one that hurts.

799
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,907
Yeah.
Those hairs are pretty deep.

800
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,075
Okay.

801
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,994
You ready?
Yup.

802
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,583
Sucker motherfucker!

803
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,294
You shithead! I hate you!

804
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,170
I hate you so much!

805
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,548
That one hurt.

806
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,967
That one hurt
just as much as the first one.

807
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,052
That's great, man.
Man!

808
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,223
One, two, three.

809
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:03,395
Fuck me!

810
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,357
In the asshole!

811
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,652
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

812
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,321
I really don't
swear this much.

813
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,822
You know what,
I got a weak stomach.

814
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,657
That's all I can really take.
I'll see ya'll.

815
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,118
Jay.
Be tough, Andy, you got it.

816
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,287
Where did Jay go?
He went to throw up.

817
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,663
Ready?
Yup.

818
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,415
One, two.

819
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,877
Cocksucker motherfucker!

820
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,712
You pulled on two.

821
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,632
Why didn't you
pull on three?

822
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,050
Freddy pie hole!

823
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,678
No! Kelly Clarkson!

824
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,644
Ya'll done or ya'll...

825
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,228
That's fucked up.
Oh, shit falls!

826
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,438
That's fucked up.

827
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,360
I hate you.

828
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,820
Stop smiling, you jerk!

829
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,072
You pussy.

830
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,240
Oh, God. What's next?

831
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,785
You're doing the nipple.
Not the nipple.

832
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,662
Come on.
Not the nipple.

833
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,413
Please, Cal,
hold my hand.

834
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,625
You kidding me, man?
Hold my goddamn hand, man.

835
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,461
Do it! Just hold.
Okay, here we go.

836
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,755
Ready?

837
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,715
No. Yup.

838
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,759
One, two, three.

839
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,762
Nipple fuck!

840
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,557
Mika, you should
burn in hell!

841
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,686
Okay, all right. No,
seriously, I think I'm done.

842
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,105
I think we're done.
I think that's good.

843
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,566
You know what, guys...

844
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,194
this is not
a good look for me!

845
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,405
You look like
a man-o'- lantern.

846
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,448
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it. Thank you.

847
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,720
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

848
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,430
Thank you.
Thanks.

849
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,932
Andy,
I owe you an apology, man.

850
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:07,436
I wasn't very nice to you for
the past two-and-a-half years.

851
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,645
You were nice to me.

852
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,314
No, I was... I thought
you were really boring and

853
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,650
I kind of thought
you were a serial killer.

854
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,403
I'm not joking.

855
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,740
Hey!
Sorry. Shoot. Sorry, sorry.

856
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,159
Don't worry. There's a lot of
padding in these.

857
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,578
I could hurl it off the
balcony, it would be fine.

858
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,371
Yeah. It will be fine.
We couldn't break this

859
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:27,497
if we tried.
No problem.

860
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,666
Look, you shouldn't listen
to Dave and Jay, okay?

861
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,836
Those guys are crazy.
You should listen to me, okay?

862
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,881
Look, there is a hot-ass girl
who works right there.

863
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,301
There she is, in the bookstore.
You should ask her out, man.

864
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,096
Something wrong
with her underpants.

865
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,681
Yeah, they're not in my mouth.

866
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,725
You know, I kind of

867
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,145
like the woman
from the eBay store.

868
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,354
That's great, but

869
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,689
you're not gonna
get with anyone

870
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,399
unless you play
the odds on this, man.

871
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:56,359
You need to plant
a lot of seeds.

872
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,946
It's like this. When I
was growing pot, I realized

873
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,617
that the more seeds
I planted... Thank you.

874
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,994
...the more pot
I could ultimately smoke.

875
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,289
I think I have all the advice
that I can handle right now.

876
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,457
Don't get bitter.

877
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,376
I'm not bitter.
I almost lost a nipple, okay?

878
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,253
That was Jay's idea, okay?

879
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,923
And I wasn't going to say
anything, but waxing your chest is

880
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,509
like the gayest thing
you could possibly do, okay?

881
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:24,304
Look at me. Looks are not
important. Really look at me.

882
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,349
I am ugly as fuck
by traditional standards

883
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,851
but I get with women.

884
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,062
Aren't you curious
as to how that's possible?

885
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,356
I am not ugly as fuck.

886
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,233
I didn't say you were
ugly as...

887
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:37,776
Well, you implied it.
Okay.

888
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,445
It doesn't matter if you're ugly
as fuck or you're ugly as shit.

889
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,615
It's about talking to women,
and I know how to do that

890
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,077
because I observe,
because I am a novelist.

891
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,621
What? You never
told me that before.

892
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,499
That's because I am not
an arrogant prick, Andy.

893
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,001
Okay? The problem
most men have is

894
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,837
they don't know
how to talk to women.

895
00:45:56,921 --> 00:46:00,632
You know what my problem is?
I am not interesting.

896
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,343
What am I supposed to say?
"I went to magic camp?"

897
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,512
"I'm an accomplished
ventriloquist?"

898
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,723
"I am a seventh-degree
imperial yo-yo master. "

899
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:11,893
Do me, yo-yo master.

900
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:15,772
I want you to do me,
'cause you're the yo-yo guy.

901
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,315
Are you done? Listen.

902
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,317
The problem
most men have is

903
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,863
they just plain straight up have
no clue how to talk to women.

904
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:26,324
Just ask questions, okay?
That's it.

905
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:31,079
Because women do not care about what
you have to say at all anyway, you know.

906
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,164
And all they want to do
is talk about themselves.

907
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,958
So you're just gonna
let them do that.

908
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,668
Okay? So remember.

909
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,963
Questions, be cool,
and be kind of a dick.

910
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,174
Here, be David Caruso
in Jade.

911
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,927
Okay. I know exactly
what you're talking about.

912
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,512
You do. That's good.

913
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,640
There she is.

914
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,186
Go plant that seed, man.

915
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,564
Plant it with your finger.

916
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,202
Can I help you?

917
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,873
I don't know. Can you?

918
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,543
Are you looking
for something?

919
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,547
Is there something
I should be looking for?

920
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,386
We have
a lot of books.

921
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,890
So, maybe it depends
on what you like.

922
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,396
What do you like?

923
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:42,150
We have a great section of...

924
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,110
do-it-yourself.

925
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,571
Do you like to
"do it yourself"?

926
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,658
Sometimes. I mean...

927
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,787
if the mood strikes.

928
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,332
How is the mood
striking you now?

929
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:07,550
What's your name?

930
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,719
I'm Beth.

931
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,934
Andy.

932
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,231
Don't tell on me, okay, Andy? I won't.

933
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,276
Unless you want
to be told on...

934
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:27,112
Beth.

935
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,533
Wow. That totally worked!

936
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,702
I literally said nothing.
And she found me fascinating.

937
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,620
I would've thought
you were doing that for years.

938
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:37,414
Should I have asked her out?
No. That's the key.

939
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:38,915
You wait for it
to grow into a plant...

940
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,500
and then you fuck the plant.

941
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,630
Okay.

942
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,757
This is easy.

943
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,926
All right.

944
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,054
Hello, Trish. How you
doing? What's going on?

945
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,849
Good joke.

946
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,684
This is a fun conversation.

947
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,145
Just grow a backbone
and call her.

948
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,856
She asked you to call her.
She wants you to call her.

949
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,031
Hello.

950
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,907
Hey, how you doing?

951
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,661
How you doing?
I'm well.

952
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,496
Who is this?

953
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:22,333
This is James.
Jam es. Do I know you, Jam es?

954
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,795
I was wondering whether
you had a few minutes...

955
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,756
to talk about
a little laundry detergent.

956
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,008
Are you a telemarketer, James?

957
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,259
Yep.

958
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,802
Are you at the top
of a tall building?

959
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,138
Can you get to a roof quickly?
Jum p off!

960
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,389
I mean, you people are sick.

961
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,266
Get a real fucking job,
why don't you?

962
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,893
Go shoot yourself
in the fucking head.

963
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,771
Hey, why don't you just, you
know, get a knife and run into it?

964
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,272
Why don't you do that, huh?

965
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,648
Okay.
I'll see you later, Jam es.

966
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:49,027
Nice to talk to you. Fuck
your m other, okay? Bye-bye.

967
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,780
Oh.

968
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,452
Hey, man.
Got a big box of porn for you.

969
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,456
Can I come in?
Yeah.

970
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,376
Sweet video game chair.

971
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:10,590
So what's in the box?

972
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,051
It's my personal collection
of erotica.

973
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,469
I want to give it to you.

974
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,472
I think there might be a few tapes
in there that just might open up...

975
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,099
Pandora's box of love.

976
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,183
Okay.

977
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,061
Amy and I, we used to
watch Harry Twatter...

978
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,646
and we'd put it on
the television...

979
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,648
and then act it out
as it was going on...

980
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,399
and it was...

981
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,945
She's adorable.

982
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,322
Fucking bitch.

983
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,407
Well, you know, this is
really gracious and kind...

984
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:37,659
and generous and everything.

985
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,453
But I just don't want a big
box of porn in my apartment.

986
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,956
There's some really
great stuff in here.

987
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,416
Really great movies in here,
man.

988
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,168
Hey, did you ever see
School of Rock?

989
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,711
Yeah.
Well, this is...

990
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,421
It's called School of...

991
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,923
You know...

992
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,593
That's nice.
But it stars Jack Black Cock.

993
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,637
That makes sense.

994
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,514
Dude, here it is.

995
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,183
Boner Jams '03.
It's a mixed tape I made.

996
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:06,354
All these great scenes that I was
really into in the summer of 2003.

997
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,399
I think you'd really dig it.
Yeah. Now I can see that.

998
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,025
This is...

999
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,694
Everybody Loves Raym ond.

1000
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,195
That's probably
not supposed to be...

1001
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,072
This is a good show.
I just tape it sometimes.

1002
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:18,199
Well, I don't think
you understand something, Dave.

1003
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:22,745
I don't want this stuff, okay?
Because I don't do that, that much.

1004
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,789
What, masturbate?
Yeah.

1005
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,251
Dude, I've jacked it twice
since I've been here.

1006
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,421
Are you kidding me? Why not?
It's not a hobby of mine.

1007
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,840
Well, then, that's the
only hobby you don't have.

1008
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,301
No, seriously, I just don't
feel comfortable talking about...

1009
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:37,468
You need to.
You're wound up.

1010
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,137
You're like one of these
action figures...

1011
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,930
all hermetically sealed
in your box.

1012
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,391
You gotta play with...
Don't!

1013
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,559
Don't take it out!

1014
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,270
I'm sorry.
You know what, it's just...

1015
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:50,064
It loses its value if you
take it out of its packaging.

1016
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:53,276
I'm just saying, let it out. Give
it some air, man. Play with it.

1017
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,029
Take your porn with you.
I'm not taking it.

1018
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,739
Take your box-o-porn.

1019
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,658
It's my gift to you.
No. I don't want it.

1020
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,076
David, it's not...

1021
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:03,203
Andy, for the last time...

1022
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,121
I don't want your giant box
of pornography.

1023
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,498
No, no, no!
Come on, man.

1024
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,083
So uncool.

1025
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,877
Uncool?

1026
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:15,715
Uncool is trying to give an
honest man a big box of porn, Andy.

1027
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,885
For the last time,
I don't want to watch

1028
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,637
School of Cock with you.

1029
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,625
It's nothing official.

1030
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,587
Just a little token
of m y appreciation.

1031
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,737
Hi, Andy.
I'm gonna talk dirty to you.

1032
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:05,158
I want to have
lots of sexy sex with you.

1033
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:09,370
I want to touch
your big, fat noodle

1034
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:13,333
'cause I want to have
naughty intercourse with you.

1035
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:17,545
I want you to put your penis
on, I mean, in me, Andy.

1036
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:21,257
I want to do lots of,
lots of sexy,

1037
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:24,010
hot things with you. Shit.

1038
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,889
This really isn't working,
Andy. I don't know what to say

1039
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,390
because I am you.

1040
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,852
Okay. New tape.

1041
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:37,940
Nothing is ever good enough
and it's always our fault.

1042
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,901
Hey, you can't speak
to your m other like that.

1043
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,861
You do.
She's not m y m other.

1044
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,202
I heard Dave gave you
the box of porn.

1045
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,620
Yeah, he did.

1046
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,956
You ever watch, like,
Primetime Live

1047
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,084
when they take a black light
into a hotel room

1048
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:58,669
and show you all the semen
all over the bedspread?

1049
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,254
Yeah.

1050
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,049
You blind someone
with that box.

1051
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,468
Could see that thing
from space.

1052
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,599
This right here, you looking at
the Bentley of big screen TVs.

1053
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,018
I'm talking about, this is the
Rolls-Royce of big screen...

1054
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,064
Sometimes, I think these
butterflies are in here.

1055
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,483
I think he might be
fooling us all, though.

1056
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,609
Really?

1057
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,778
I actually think he might be,
like, some genius

1058
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,947
and this is like
some big, like, hilarious...

1059
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,991
Like he's bored at work and he
just wanted to kick up some shit,

1060
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,451
so he told us all
he's a virgin.

1061
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,620
You're seeing that a lot
of stuff that's not there.

1062
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,664
You're just projecting
all over him.

1063
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,416
He might be an idiot savant

1064
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,502
but he's not, like,
clever enough to go that deep.

1065
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,920
But he's got a great body.

1066
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,339
Would you fuck him?
In a New York minute.

1067
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,049
You would fuck him?
Absolutely.

1068
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,137
Hey, Andy, what are you doing
for lunch?

1069
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,764
I don't know.
I have a turkey sandwich.

1070
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,684
We're gonna go around the corner.
I think you should come with us.

1071
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,562
There's this great place.
A lot of cute girls.

1072
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,439
I don't know. Okay.

1073
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,275
We brought you a shirt.

1074
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,485
This place is pretty fancy.

1075
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,821
Something going on?

1076
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,739
Hey, who's ready
to have some fun?

1077
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,201
Hey, guys...

1078
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,080
No, don't ignore me.
I know what this is.

1079
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:18,666
Within one hour,
you'll each have 20 dates.

1080
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,128
Don't... Please don't do this.
I saw this on Primetime Live.

1081
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,963
All right, ninja master.

1082
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,382
We've given you all the advice
we have to give.

1083
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:27,633
Now you gonna put it
in action.

1084
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,677
Advice? You guys all
gave me different advice.

1085
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,637
He thinks you're a pothead.
I am.

1086
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,891
Dude. Hey, partner.
What are you whining about?

1087
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,101
You asked for this shit.
No, I didn't.

1088
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:39,020
Will you just quit whining
like a bitch?

1089
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,606
I'm not whining like a bitch.
You are whining like a bitch.

1090
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,692
And you about to cram like 10
years of pimpage into one day.

1091
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,653
I don't want to cram pimpage.
Partner, after that

1092
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,739
you on my level. Come on.

1093
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:52,325
Just ask questions.
This is a bad idea.

1094
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,662
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

1095
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:57,997
I'm fine.

1096
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,333
Are you fine?

1097
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,168
Yeah.

1098
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,670
You're fine then?

1099
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,508
Are you fucking retarded? What
the hell's the matter with you?

1100
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,384
Do you want me to be
fucking retarded?

1101
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,930
When I look into the eyes of
the children and the parents

1102
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,431
and they are smiling
and saying,

1103
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,767
"Thank you, Dr. Montalban,
you saved my child",

1104
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,935
it was worth it.

1105
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:22,939
Amy,

1106
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,733
what are you doing here?
David.

1107
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,445
And you are Gina?
Gina.

1108
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,239
Hey, what's up?
Nothing.

1109
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,950
Look, I'm going to be
real honest with you.

1110
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,494
It's been a long time
since I've been with a man.

1111
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,247
Spent a lot of time
with the ladies.

1112
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,749
Looking to get back up
on that pogo stick.

1113
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,793
You know what I'm saying?
Excuse me.

1114
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,797
Remember that time when we made
love and you cried in my arms?

1115
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,299
Please don't reminisce about
the times we fucked, please.

1116
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,260
It's so creepy.
Let's go to Paris.

1117
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,137
I want to take you underneath the
Eiffel Tower and make love to you.

1118
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,472
Cut it out.
Cut what out?

1119
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:59,141
This go to Paris! We've been
broken up for like two years, man.

1120
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,643
I don't want to
date you anymore.

1121
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,311
You're a whore.
I am not a whore.

1122
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,021
I just didn't like you.

1123
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,231
This is so us.

1124
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,068
Psycho talk.
What?

1125
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,987
You're a good-looking man.
Thank you.

1126
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,447
Very pretty.
Real soft, delicate features.

1127
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,992
You're real feminine, you
know, which is good for me

1128
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,744
because that would be
a simple sort of transition.

1129
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,996
You know what I'm saying?

1130
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,249
Maybe throw a little rouge
on you, tuck your sac back.

1131
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,875
You game?
No.

1132
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,755
You need to stop fucking
around with my friend, okay?

1133
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,675
Because you're giving him hope,
and it's driving the man crazy.

1134
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,845
I moved, I changed my e-mail
address, my phone number.

1135
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,305
He's practically
stalking me.

1136
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,807
Well, I didn't know all that.
So, I'm sorry.

1137
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,184
I love Minnesota.

1138
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,854
I grew up in a town
outside of Minneapolis

1139
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,815
with a population of, like,
500 people. Really small.

1140
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,151
Yeah, it's like
the Land of a Thousand Lakes.

1141
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,987
What about you? You're used
to, like, a really big city.

1142
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,323
Really... God, yes.

1143
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,785
The town that I grew up in
was really small. I mean,

1144
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,747
you know, it was just so safe.
There was no crime.

1145
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:06,042
I mean, a girl could just walk
from one end of town to the other

1146
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,961
and just, you know,
feel completely safe.

1147
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,424
You suppose he's had enough?

1148
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,968
Spank bank has
once again been filled.

1149
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:18,387
I'll tell you
who's the hottest.

1150
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,557
You're gonna think I'm crazy.
Let me tell you. Gina.

1151
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,977
Can't get va-Gina out of
my head. Va-Gina all week.

1152
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,238
You know what's a fun game?
Huh?

1153
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,240
You take three
Excedrin PMs...

1154
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:41,035
and you see if you could whack
off before you fall asleep.

1155
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,539
You always win is the
best part about the game.

1156
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,211
Are you Andy?
Yeah.

1157
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,879
Is this yours?
Did you write this stuff?

1158
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,632
My girlfriend, Jill, found
your speed-dating card.

1159
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:56,676
Yeah, right.

1160
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,886
God, I've been looking
for that speed-dating card.

1161
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,763
Thank you so much
for bringing it to me.

1162
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,973
So, you actually wrote
that one girl looked like...

1163
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,934
she was
"hurting for a squirting"?

1164
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:08,020
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Hurting for
a squirting, I wrote that.

1165
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,439
So you wrote
"ho fo show. "

1166
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,734
Yeah, I remember that girl.
She was a ho.

1167
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:15,611
Fo show.

1168
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,863
Let me show you
how this device works.

1169
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,657
Right, I'm just looking
for a cordless phone.

1170
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,451
Yup, it's great. You can do
anything, make video diaries...

1171
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:26,163
Hey, Amy, how's it going?
How you feeling? I'm great.

1172
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,999
I feel fantastic
since we broke up.

1173
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,168
I feel awesome!

1174
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,879
Can you just show me the department
where there would be phones?

1175
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,132
How have you been?
What's been going on...

1176
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,259
I bet... Hey, have you been
doing a lot of this?

1177
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,929
Sir, please, sir.

1178
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,472
You are never gonna
meet anybody...

1179
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:46,183
with that kind of mentality about
women, you sick son of a bitch.

1180
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,018
Who the fuck are you
to put me on trial?

1181
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,729
I've never even met you.

1182
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,022
So why don't you
back the shit off, all right?

1183
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,108
And stop with the inquisition.

1184
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,484
That's how you talk?

1185
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,403
You know what,
I don't have to answer to you.

1186
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,029
You ain't my bitch.

1187
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:00,656
Know what I saying?

1188
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:03,033
So, shit, man. Fuck it.

1189
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,161
You shouldn't even be
hanging out with this pervert.

1190
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,371
I don't hang out with him.
I work with him and that's it.

1191
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:09,123
I tried to introduce him
to a few nice people...

1192
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,291
he made a fool of himself.

1193
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,042
I don't mess with him, baby.
That's not me.

1194
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,336
You should keep your ho
on a leash.

1195
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:16,046
Bro, I can't let you...
Hey.

1196
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:18,299
I can't let you be talking
to my woman like that, dawg.

1197
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,551
Know what I'm saying?
Bitch is running wild, man.

1198
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,846
You miss that ass?
That's the ass of a free man.

1199
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,265
That ass is going out tonight,
maybe to a club.

1200
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,933
Maybe to a night club.

1201
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,435
Hey, Andy...

1202
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,854
take a look at your pal.
Oh, my God.

1203
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,482
Yeah, he's performing
a public colonoscopy.

1204
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:35,941
Isn't that sweet?

1205
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,526
I'm gonna send
David home for the day...

1206
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,736
and you're gonna
fill in for him.

1207
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,529
What? Selling things?
You got that right.

1208
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:41,822
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1209
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,407
And you're gonna have to
talk to people, too.

1210
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,117
I know that's a frightening
concept to you...

1211
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,410
but I think you can handle it.

1212
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,245
So get out there
and start selling some shit.

1213
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,663
...thing for Amy.

1214
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:51,415
Hold it.
Check it out.

1215
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,917
I miss her.

1216
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,755
Dude, the floor's
the ultimate aphrodisiac.

1217
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,590
All you got to do
is go make your pick now.

1218
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,051
Come on, man.
Okay.

1219
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,804
And you could act
a little enthused about it.

1220
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,013
Yeah.

1221
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,601
That's right. That's right.
Gazelle in the pink top.

1222
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,437
Oh, shit.
Hi.

1223
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:15,606
Looks like you're
checking out digital cameras.

1224
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,608
You know what, he ain't going
to do it willingly.

1225
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,486
No. We need to, like, really
facilitate things a bit more.

1226
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,154
Yo, Andy.
Yeah.

1227
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,697
What's up, dude?
This is Jay, man.

1228
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,032
Hey, Jay.

1229
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,575
I am throwing a party tonight.

1230
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,369
It's gonna be real mellow,
just chilled up.

1231
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,829
Now, you really
need to be there.

1232
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,456
It's gonna be
really, really colorful.

1233
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,041
Are you free?

1234
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:35,960
Yeah, I think so.

1235
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:38,420
That was a joke, m an.
I know you're free.

1236
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,089
I'm okay.
Gotta go, man.

1237
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,257
All right, bye.

1238
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:46,178
So, tell me, Montel...

1239
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,598
why weren't we invited to the
party? What are we, Al-Qaeda?

1240
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,766
No, hold up.

1241
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:53,018
No, no. It's not that
kind of party, y'all.

1242
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,145
You're not coming to our
fucking party either, okay?

1243
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,272
Fuck you, okay?

1244
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,107
First of all,
it ain't that kind of party.

1245
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,067
Go fuck a goat.
Yeah.

1246
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,986
Why you always telling me
to fuck a goat, man?

1247
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,112
Fuck a goat!

1248
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:24,258
Hello?

1249
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,261
Hello.

1250
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,598
Hello. Hi.

1251
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:34,101
Are you here for Jay's party?
Yes.

1252
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,103
I am Jay's party.

1253
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,025
You know what, hiring a transvestite
prostitute isn't helping me, man.

1254
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,360
What? Ain't nobody hired
no damn transvestite.

1255
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,486
What are you talking about?

1256
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,363
She was really nice,
incidentally.

1257
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:48,198
If that sister
was a transvestite...

1258
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:50,367
that was the Mona Lisa
of transvestites.

1259
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:52,328
You got a hummer
from the tranny, didn't you?

1260
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:55,706
You know, aren't we owed one now?
'Cause technically we paid her.

1261
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,124
She had a dick, man.

1262
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,876
Do you guys even like me?

1263
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,379
Or is this some sort of cruel
joke that you're all in on?

1264
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,757
Because I'm not a freak.
I'm a good person.

1265
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,344
I always thought that Matt Damon
was like a Streisand, but...

1266
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,930
I think that he's rocking
the shit in this one.

1267
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,723
Shut up, Dave!

1268
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:16,685
Hold up. Let's just chill on
the aggression for a minute.

1269
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:21,190
Look at him.
He is such a bad ass.

1270
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,193
He looks
just like Luke Wilson.

1271
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,277
Mmm-hmm.

1272
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,071
So you saying
she was definitely a man?

1273
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:28,197
Yes.

1274
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,366
Okay, well, how do you know
that she was a man?

1275
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,369
Because her hands were
as big as Andr the Giant's.

1276
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:36,497
And she had an Adam's apple
as big as her balls.

1277
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:38,666
So you have no proof.

1278
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,709
You know what?
Just leave me alone.

1279
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:42,836
Just stay away from me.
Or I'm gonna tell Paula...

1280
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,838
that you're all stealing
the recordable CDs.

1281
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:48,175
Come on. That's like
we were paid to do it.

1282
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,302
We did this
'cause we're your friends...

1283
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,138
and we didn't think you have
the balls to do it yourself.

1284
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,515
Really?
Yeah.

1285
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,058
Okay, watch this.

1286
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,726
Yo, Andy,
it's just CDs, man.

1287
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,687
That's a third strike
for me, dawg.

1288
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,294
Hi.

1289
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,256
Andy. Hi.
Right, yeah.

1290
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,049
You remember my name.
I did.

1291
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,635
How you doing? I'm
great. I like your store.

1292
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,304
That's good, yeah. If you
have time, look around. It's...

1293
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,472
Okay.

1294
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,224
How's business been?

1295
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,269
You know, it's coming along.
I mean, it takes a while.

1296
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,397
Do you want to go out sometime? Yes.

1297
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,316
Yes, I would like that.
That would be great.

1298
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:50,154
I think I'm maybe free this
weekend, if that's okay.

1299
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:53,032
Or you could call me tomorrow
and we can just firm it up.

1300
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:54,658
Okay. Great.
Great.

1301
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:58,328
Okay, so I'll call you,
and yeah, that'll be good.

1302
01:05:58,413 --> 01:05:59,872
How you doing?
Congratulations.

1303
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,874
Okay, so I'll... Yeah.

1304
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,500
Can I help you?

1305
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:06,086
Yeah, these are wonderful.
I'll take these.

1306
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:09,923
Thanks, they are. They're great.
The goldfish just crack me up.

1307
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,050
Funny.

1308
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,217
Yeah, they are.
Yeah.

1309
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,510
Yeah.
They're cute.

1310
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:16,764
I don't actually sell anything
here. I just sell them on eBay.

1311
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:18,682
I don't get it.

1312
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:19,933
Okay.

1313
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,020
Can you help me?
No, you're on your own here.

1314
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,273
Good luck to you, and to you.
And I'll give you a call.

1315
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:29,359
Great. Nice to see you.
Great. Thanks for coming in.

1316
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:30,944
Bye.

1317
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,614
So, I guess I'll just
give you some money...

1318
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:36,200
and you can give me
these shoes and...

1319
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,994
You know,
I know it seems so strange...

1320
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:41,747
Yes. I'd just rather buy them
from you straight up.

1321
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,749
Yeah, I know. I wish it
could be that easy, but...

1322
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,044
I wish, too, but you're making
it extremely difficult for me.

1323
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,296
I'm just trying to get these
shoes back to my house...

1324
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,631
so I can wear them.

1325
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:52,633
I got a corpse in m y way.

1326
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,884
Look out. Just kill it.

1327
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,970
That's just so not fair
that you have blades and...

1328
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,972
I'm telling you, man,
I feel great.

1329
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,058
I'm so... It's like a
weight has been lifted.

1330
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:04,728
Celibacy is the way to go, man.
Andy had it right, you know?

1331
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:06,688
Look at him. He looks
younger than all of us...

1332
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,023
but he's 10 years older.

1333
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:10,609
Why? Because he's never had
a relationship.

1334
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:13,529
No she-devil sucked
his life force out yet.

1335
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,256
Hello?
Hey. Hi. Hello.

1336
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:33,674
Is this Trish?

1337
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:36,802
Who's calling, please?
This is Andy.

1338
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,096
Hi, Andy.
Hi, how you doing?

1339
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,141
I'm good. How're you doing?
I'm doing great.

1340
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,184
So you're gay, now?

1341
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:46,186
No, I'm not gay.
I'm just celibate.

1342
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,897
I think...
I mean, that sounds gay.

1343
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,859
I just want you to know that
this is the first conversation...

1344
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:55,362
of three conversations
that leads to you being gay.

1345
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,407
There's this and then in a
year it's like, "You know...

1346
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:01,618
"I'm kind of going to wanna get back
out there, but I think I like guys. "

1347
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:04,538
And then there's the big,
"I'm a gay guy now. "

1348
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,249
You're gay for saying that.
I'm gay for saying that?

1349
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,960
You know how I know you're gay?
How? How do you know I'm gay?

1350
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,504
'Cause you macramd yourself
a pair of jean shorts.

1351
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:13,672
You know how I know
you're gay?

1352
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,799
You just told me you're not
sleeping with women anymore.

1353
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,467
You know how I know you're gay? How?

1354
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:20,596
'Cause you're gay and you can
tell who other gay people are?

1355
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,222
Do you know how I know you're gay? How?

1356
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:23,765
You like Coldplay.

1357
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,809
You're dead.

1358
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,270
Come on.

1359
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,314
Leave my torso alone
at least.

1360
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,608
I also wanted to call...

1361
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:35,402
and see what night
you might want to go out.

1362
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,362
I'm actually free tonight.

1363
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:42,743
Okay. Now, I was thinking maybe
this weekend, but that's good. Okay.

1364
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:43,827
Great.

1365
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:45,913
Okay, what time
do you want to pick me up?

1366
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,749
Let's see.

1367
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:53,128
That's actually kind of a
problem because I ride a bike.

1368
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,796
That's cool.
Are you kidding m e?

1369
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,673
I love getting on the back
of a motorcycle.

1370
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:59,426
My boyfriend in college
drove a motorcycle.

1371
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,303
So, I mean, I'm cool.

1372
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:05,474
Yeah, I bet that was cool.
I ride a bicycle.

1373
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,185
You know how I know
that you're gay?

1374
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,353
How?

1375
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,688
You like the movie
Maid in Manhattan.

1376
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,273
You know how I know you're gay? How?

1377
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:16,526
I saw you make a spinach dip in
a loaf of sourdough bread once.

1378
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,362
You know how I know you're gay? How?

1379
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:21,156
You have a rainbow bumper
sticker on your car that says:

1380
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,450
"I love it
when balls are in my face. "

1381
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,618
That's gay?

1382
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,078
God damn it!

1383
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:29,081
I'm ripping your head off
right now. It's off.

1384
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,667
And now I'm throwing it
at your body.

1385
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,627
Fuck you!

1386
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,129
You guys...

1387
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,091
she's picking me up
in an hour.

1388
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,760
Oh, drag, dude.

1389
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,554
She's picking you up from here? Yeah.

1390
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,181
That's fucked up, man.

1391
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:47,891
Why?
Why?

1392
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:52,020
Seriously. I mean,
look at this place, man.

1393
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,816
You gotta see this through
the eyes of a woman, you know?

1394
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,235
What is she going to think
when she comes in here? Look.

1395
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,737
He's got a billion toys.
So what?

1396
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:03,573
And more video games
than a teenaged Asian kid.

1397
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,200
It's all right.

1398
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,662
Is that the
Six Million Dollar Man's boss?

1399
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:10,122
It's Oscar Goldman.

1400
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,416
Why do you have that?
That's worth a lot of money.

1401
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,459
That's much more valuable
than Steve Austin.

1402
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:18,797
Well, that may be the case. But
none of this shit is sexy, okay?

1403
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,590
I'm not
trying to be sexy, man.

1404
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,217
I mean, seriously, Asia?

1405
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,136
You framed an Asia poster?

1406
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,221
How hard did the people
at the frame store laugh...

1407
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,307
when you brought this in?
They did not laugh at me.

1408
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,267
Know why you're gay?
Because you like Asia.

1409
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:31,601
You guys cool it
with the gay.

1410
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,520
You know, she's on her way
over here, okay?

1411
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:35,314
First, you relax, okay?

1412
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,692
Just stop calming me down
and tell me what I should do.

1413
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,944
Okay, we just take everything
that's embarrassing...

1414
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:42,112
and we move it out of here.

1415
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,197
So it doesn't look like
you live in Neverland Ranch.

1416
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:52,831
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

1417
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:53,957
Good.

1418
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:56,001
So, you wanna head out?

1419
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,961
Did you just
move in or something?

1420
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:00,297
No. Actually I'm getting
new carpet in.

1421
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,758
I'm having carpet
put in tomorrow, so...

1422
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:05,469
Well, you know.
Yeah.

1423
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,220
Okay.
Looks good with the floors.

1424
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:08,722
Yeah.
All right.

1425
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:10,515
I should tear up
the hard wood...

1426
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,726
and see if there's
carpet underneath.

1427
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,686
That's never the case.

1428
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,649
This is gonna be fun.
Yes.

1429
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:21,651
You know, I drive by
this place every day.

1430
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,445
I've never been in
before.

1431
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:25,322
I'm glad you came.

1432
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:28,658
You know, I never really go
out with nice guys like you.

1433
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:32,454
I think I've avoided nice guys
like you my whole life...

1434
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,997
at my own peril.

1435
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,501
My last boyfriend
drank a lot.

1436
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:38,585
Mmm-hmm.

1437
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,170
And so...
This is just punch.

1438
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,256
No, it's okay.
A little bit's fine.

1439
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,592
Buddha punch.
I need some Buddha.

1440
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,595
Excuse me, miss.
Could you gather your team...

1441
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:51,431
and sing happy birthday
for my daughter, please?

1442
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,577
That was so good. What? That
was great. Happy birthday.

1443
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,621
It's your birthday, too?
No.

1444
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,790
It's his birthday, too.
No, no, no.

1445
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,459
Could you sing for him
and bring him a cake?

1446
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,044
Happy birthday.

1447
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:37,519
Thanks a lot.
Happy birthday, Andy.

1448
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:56,913
You really like kissing, don't you? Yes.

1449
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:00,917
I really do.

1450
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,752
Take off your pants,
okay?

1451
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,630
Okay.
Okay.

1452
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,469
Wow, this is really
gonna happen. Oh, yeah.

1453
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,012
Thank God.

1454
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:16,600
Okay, I'm taking off my pants. Yeah.

1455
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,560
Do you need some help?

1456
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:22,355
I think I almost got them.
It's hooked on my ankle.

1457
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,524
Wow, that's...

1458
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,903
Hey, wait.
Do you have protection?

1459
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,654
I don't like guns.

1460
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,117
That's funny.

1461
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:36,536
I have condoms
right here. Okay?

1462
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,455
Okay.
There's, you know...

1463
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:41,625
Check the expiration date because
they were from when I was married.

1464
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:44,503
And we didn't have sex that often.
That's why there are so many, okay?

1465
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,712
Okay.

1466
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:51,426
I got them.

1467
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,430
How does this go?

1468
01:13:55,932 --> 01:14:00,644
Okay. "Roll over the tip
and down onto the base. "

1469
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,105
Over the balls?

1470
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,233
It doesn't say.

1471
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,488
Do you mind
if I use your magnum?

1472
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,657
Yeah.

1473
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,494
Wow. You got to be kidding.

1474
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,913
I am Aquaman.

1475
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,375
What is that?

1476
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,519
Mom?

1477
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:44,938
What's going on here?

1478
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:46,940
Who the hell are you?
It's Andy.

1479
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:48,066
Hi, I'm Andy.

1480
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,651
God! What are you doing?

1481
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,736
Marla, get the fuck
out of my room!

1482
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:52,862
You know what...

1483
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:55,490
I cannot believe that you're
allowed to have sex when I'm not!

1484
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:57,492
That is so unfair.
I'm gonna head out.

1485
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:58,577
You should go.

1486
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:01,621
Oh, Jesus! How many
times did you just do it?

1487
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:02,831
Oh, my God!

1488
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:06,835
I'm so sorry.

1489
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,677
Dude, teach me.

1490
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:26,980
Hotline.

1491
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:30,567
Hi, yes, I'm calling because
it's more than four hours

1492
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:33,695
and your ad said to call if
it's been more than four hours.

1493
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,697
How much of the medicine
have you taken, sir?

1494
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,117
I haven't taken any,
but your ad said

1495
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:43,079
that if you've had an erection
for more than four hours, you call.

1496
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:46,583
You're only supposed to call
if you've taken the m edicine.

1497
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:50,045
Okay. I'm sorry. I must
not have heard that part.

1498
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,589
Yes. If you haven't taken
the m edicine, you don't call.

1499
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,716
Right. I'm sorry. Right.

1500
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:57,052
So, there's nothing
you can do?

1501
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,554
I just don't wanna...
There's nothing I can do.

1502
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:00,722
I'm in Bom bay, India.

1503
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,558
Okay. No, not you personally.
I just don't want...

1504
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,727
I just don't want
to have an erection anymore.

1505
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:09,064
You know,
you could have sex.

1506
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,190
Okay. Yup.

1507
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:14,694
That's one thing people do
when they have an erection.

1508
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:17,322
Yeah, that's not an option.
I don't have sex.

1509
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,741
Okay, well,
then you can m asturbate.

1510
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,493
I'd rather not masturbate.

1511
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,537
If you'd like the erection to
go away, you can light a m atch,

1512
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:28,708
blow out the flame and put
the hot em ber on your wrist.

1513
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,461
And that will focus
the brain elsewhere

1514
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,130
and you will lose your
erection. Really? That'd work?

1515
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:37,008
Take your finger
and flick your testicle

1516
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,510
and if you do that
till it hurts

1517
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,804
your erection will go away.
Okay, all right.

1518
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,263
It sounds unpleasant
and it is.

1519
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,057
It is a trick we use
in India.

1520
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:47,894
Okay, those are all good pieces
of advice. I really appreciate it.

1521
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,021
We appreciate your business.

1522
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,232
Oh, no.
We didn't get your business...

1523
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:55,777
No, not this time. I guess I didn't
need you this time. Thank you.

1524
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,850
My goodness, Andy,
you are a terrific salesman.

1525
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:29,227
Thank you.
Gosh, you really got it down.

1526
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,146
Thanks.
And your numbers are good.

1527
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,230
Thanks.

1528
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,190
I'm going to put you out
on the floor full time.

1529
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:35,233
Really?
Yeah.

1530
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,317
Wow. Okay.

1531
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,570
Good. We're gonna get you a
blue shirt and tie, all right?

1532
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:39,696
Great. Thanks.

1533
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,699
You know, Andy, I've been
thinking about your problem.

1534
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,951
I think I might have
a solution for you.

1535
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,247
You ever heard of the term
"fuck buddy"?

1536
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,125
What?

1537
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,711
It's a special friend

1538
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,880
who you fuck.

1539
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,924
No, haven't heard that term.

1540
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,969
When I was a little girl,
I developed early.

1541
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:06,681
By the time I was 14, I had
this body you're looking at.

1542
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:09,851
Can you imagine that?
I don't want to, no.

1543
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:13,480
Well, needless to say,
a lot of male attention.

1544
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:14,731
Like men, yes.

1545
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:18,818
Especially from our
Guatemalan gardener, Javier.

1546
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:20,111
Okay.

1547
01:18:20,488 --> 01:18:22,197
You know, Javier,

1548
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:27,869
before he made passionate yet
gentle love to me for the first time,

1549
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:33,333
he serenaded me with a beautiful
old Guatemalan love song.

1550
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,084
Really, that's...

1551
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:37,837
That sounds nice.

1552
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,324
Okay.

1553
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:09,202
My goodness.

1554
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,663
I think we better get
back to work. Yeah.

1555
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:14,123
Yeah, I better go back to work. Yeah.

1556
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,042
So, okay.
All right.

1557
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,961
So, you mull it over
and I'll talk to you soon.

1558
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,921
All right, I will. Thank you. Okay.

1559
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,012
What's up, dawg? What happened?
How was the date with Trish?

1560
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,390
It was a disaster.
Really?

1561
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:33,268
Yes. I've never been
more embarrassed in my life.

1562
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:35,520
Couldn't get the
condoms to work.

1563
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,356
And one of them
exploded on my balls.

1564
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,441
And then her kid
walked in the room.

1565
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:41,526
Wait. Hold up.

1566
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,027
She was hiding the kid
from you, dawg?

1567
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,445
You know what,
it doesn't matter

1568
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,864
because it was going downhill
straight from there.

1569
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:49,117
Listen, you don't want
no baby-daddy drama.

1570
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,410
Trust me on this one,
all right?

1571
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:52,537
For all you know,
he in prison right now.

1572
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,997
Let's say y'all
living together.

1573
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:57,041
Next thing you know, you the one
going on the 1 st and the 15th

1574
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,334
to pick up the
government check.

1575
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,503
What if he got boys
that's on the outside

1576
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:01,671
and they stalking you?

1577
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,631
You see what I'm saying?
You got to think, partner...

1578
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,383
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1579
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,927
Here's what you do.
You tell her you're a virgin.

1580
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,138
You test her
with this shit, okay?

1581
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,974
Here, tell me. Tell me. This
is how it's gonna go. Tell me.

1582
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,851
I'm a virgin.
Sweet.

1583
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:18,771
I like that because
you don't have chlamydia.

1584
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:22,734
And I know that,
and that shit is everywhere.

1585
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,069
What if she
laughs at me, though?

1586
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,322
Then you punch her in the
fucking head if she laughs.

1587
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,949
I'm not going to punch her in
the head. She's really sweet.

1588
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:33,578
No. I mean, you punch her in
her fucking head emotionally.

1589
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,664
She's different. She's someone
I felt like I had

1590
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,082
a connection with.

1591
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:41,419
All you trying to do right now
is bust off this first nut.

1592
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:44,005
You got a whole lot of semen
back up in you.

1593
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,214
I am going to tell her.

1594
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:47,133
You should totally tell
her, man. I'm going to.

1595
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:49,427
'Cause I watched this movie
called Liar Liar

1596
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,180
and the message was,
"Don't lie. "

1597
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,931
And that was a smart movie.

1598
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,516
Yeah, that's the right thing.
Yeah.

1599
01:20:56,268 --> 01:21:00,188
Really? All your girlfriends wanted
to have sex with virgins, too?

1600
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:04,484
That's funny. I didn't even
know you girls talked like that.

1601
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,237
I think my first time
might be your best time, too.

1602
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,448
Well, I knew it.
You know what,

1603
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,618
I knew that you'd react
that way and I knew that,

1604
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:18,373
you would want to lead me
through my first sexual encounter

1605
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:23,169
with all the compassion
and care that someone

1606
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,046
would give to their soul mate.

1607
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,006
Oh, my God. I'm in trouble.

1608
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,511
Hey, Andy.

1609
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:33,805
You watching Survivor tonight?

1610
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,349
No, actually I'm going out
to dinner with somebody.

1611
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:37,433
Hi.

1612
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:38,893
This is her.

1613
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,978
Trish, this is Joe and Sara. Hi.

1614
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,355
Hi, Trish.
Hey.

1615
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:43,981
But tape it for me,
okay?

1616
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:45,692
Will do. All right.
Thanks.

1617
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:46,943
So long.
Bye-bye.

1618
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:48,695
See you later.
Have a good night.

1619
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:51,197
Yeah, my man's gonna
get it on tonight.

1620
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:52,240
Yes, sir.

1621
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,867
Yeah, and you better
get on me, too.

1622
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,036
What is wrong
with this woman?

1623
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,413
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

1624
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:06,379
I'm so sorry that happened
the other night.

1625
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,505
No, I'm sorry.

1626
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,257
Oh, my God.
That was me.

1627
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,341
No.

1628
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,761
Let me... I have something
I want to tell you.

1629
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,597
Kind of hard to talk about.

1630
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:18,558
But...

1631
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:22,311
you know,
there are certain things...

1632
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,022
about who I am that...

1633
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:28,526
I'm sorry. I just have
to get this off my chest.

1634
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,320
I am so sorry,
I didn't tell you I had kids.

1635
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,865
Yeah, what was that about?

1636
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,325
Gosh. You know,
that really surprised me.

1637
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:41,080
No, you should have
told me probably, but...

1638
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:42,165
I'm sorry. I know.

1639
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,333
What do I care
if you have a kid?

1640
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,502
Well, I have two kids.

1641
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:49,756
Wow. Okay.
How old are they?

1642
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:51,841
Six.

1643
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:53,801
Sixteen.

1644
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,636
Twenty-one.

1645
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:57,847
Forty-two.

1646
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:00,641
Fifty-six. How many kids
do you have?

1647
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,560
I have three.
Okay, three.

1648
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,604
Yeah, and one of them has a kid.

1649
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:06,022
A one-year-old.

1650
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:08,065
That's cool. That's great.

1651
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:13,571
I'm really glad we're
doing this. Me, too.

1652
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:19,494
Listen, Andy...

1653
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,872
I don't want to send you running
for the hills or anything, but...

1654
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:27,668
I really feel like if we
decide to do this again, then...

1655
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:33,049
maybe we should hold off on
the physical part for a while.

1656
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:37,261
That is a fantastic idea.

1657
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,514
Why didn't I think of that?

1658
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:40,807
Really?
Totally.

1659
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:44,185
No sex?
No. Why do that?

1660
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:46,062
Because here's the thing.

1661
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,396
From personal experience...

1662
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:50,149
I found that sex can
really complicate things.

1663
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:53,319
And what we should be doing right
now is getting to know each other.

1664
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:54,403
Yeah.

1665
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,781
Well, I never thought
you'd go for it.

1666
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,241
I'm going for it.

1667
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:01,244
Well, that just
is a great, great notion.

1668
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,287
Are you serious?

1669
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:06,165
Look at my face.
Look at how serious I am.

1670
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,167
Can you see my nostrils?

1671
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,086
Yes.
That's serious.

1672
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,754
That's more angry.

1673
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,423
Yeah, you know what,
most guys would be saying:

1674
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:17,718
"Yeah," right now, but, like,
by the third date, it would be:

1675
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:21,347
"Hey, baby, I really need to
physically express how I feel"...

1676
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,766
and all that stuff.
Well, hey, baby...

1677
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:26,936
you know, three dates...
Make it 10, 10 dates.

1678
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:30,106
How about 15?

1679
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:33,943
Fifteen. Screw your 15.
20 dates.

1680
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:36,279
Okay, 20 dates.
Twenty dates.

1681
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,906
Okay.
This is genius.

1682
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:40,616
It's gonna hurt.

1683
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:44,620
Not as much as you think.

1684
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,457
We can really get to know
each other this way.

1685
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:49,542
Yeah.

1686
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,545
This is one, right?
No, next one.

1687
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:00,386
Is it safe to come in,
or are you guys doing it?

1688
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,138
Honey, it's safe.

1689
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:05,641
Great.

1690
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:07,393
Well, good timing.

1691
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:09,395
Yeah.
You remember Marla.

1692
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:12,398
Hi, we met. And this is
my little bunny rabbit.

1693
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:13,900
Julia.
Hey.

1694
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,360
This is Andy.
Julia, how you doing?

1695
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:20,907
You know what, do you
by any chance like magic?

1696
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,868
Yeah.
I thought that you might.

1697
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,411
Because I noticed
on the way in...

1698
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,080
that you had something shiny
behind your ear.

1699
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,583
Marla, did you see that?
Something behind her ear?

1700
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,168
You think you do?
Could I check?

1701
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:34,545
Do you mind if I check
behind your ear?

1702
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,130
Big money!

1703
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:40,259
That's amazing.
Wow, it is amazing.

1704
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,428
There's something else, too,
behind your ear, I think.

1705
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:45,139
No, actually it's not behind
your ear. I think it is your ear.

1706
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,223
Rip!

1707
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:49,769
It is your ear.
There is your ear.

1708
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,145
I ripped it off.

1709
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,772
Gross!
Yeah, that's...

1710
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:55,816
All right. Wait. Okay,
but that means that you...

1711
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,861
walk around with a rubber ear
in your pocket all day?

1712
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:01,572
Yeah, like half the time.

1713
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:03,699
You know, I can come
to your high school...

1714
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:05,743
and do it for your friends
if you want.

1715
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,620
You know what,
I should head out.

1716
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,038
Really?
Yeah.

1717
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:10,998
I have to give you
a ride home.

1718
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,291
Right. Yes, you do.

1719
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,627
Yeah, 'cause you don't have
a car or anything, right?

1720
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,253
Right, I don't have a car.

1721
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,965
'Cause he doesn't have a car,
and he does magic.

1722
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,383
Awesome.

1723
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:23,135
And sarcasm is like
a second language to me.

1724
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,304
So, I'm right there with you.

1725
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,558
But, Dad,

1726
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:33,604
I don't know how to love.

1727
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:35,982
You never

1728
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:40,111
taught me how...

1729
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:45,324
Hello.
Hey, Cal.

1730
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:47,702
Hey.
I just got back from a date.

1731
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,912
Did you tell her
you're a virgin?

1732
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:52,373
No. I haven't gotten
to that yet.

1733
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,667
Really?
Are you having sex right now?

1734
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,086
No. She was incredible.

1735
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,672
She was amazing.
She didn't pressure me.

1736
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:02,758
And she has three kids.

1737
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,844
And one of her kids
has a kid.

1738
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,347
You all right?

1739
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:13,019
Did you just say she has three
kids, one of whom has a kid?

1740
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:15,563
Yeah.
So, so, she's a grandm a?

1741
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:16,731
No.

1742
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:18,566
I'm not a doctor
or anything like that

1743
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,818
but she's a fucking grandma.

1744
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,237
Yeah, whatever, you know.

1745
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:24,697
She's the hottest grandma
I ever saw.

1746
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,198
Yeah, she is.
She's a hot grandm a.

1747
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:29,035
That's a good-looking grandma. My
grandma looks like Jack Palance.

1748
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:30,119
Well, she's no Jack Palance.

1749
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:31,912
No. If Jack Palance
looked like that lady,

1750
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,956
I would want to
fuck Jack Palance right now.

1751
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,082
Yeah, me, too.

1752
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:36,751
She's a hot grandma.

1753
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:38,711
Heck, yeah.
No, do a grandm a, m an.

1754
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:41,589
You should fuck her
on her plastic-covered couch.

1755
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,383
Fuck her while she watches
Murder, She Wrote.

1756
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,052
She would probably find that
very erotic.

1757
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,344
Yeah, whatever, you know.

1758
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:50,931
Fuck her and then have her send you
a check for $12 on your birthday.

1759
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,851
I'm the dude
with the hot granny.

1760
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:57,021
What did you want to
talk to me about?

1761
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,814
Well, Andy,
the numbers just came in...

1762
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:02,610
and you are by far
our best salesman.

1763
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:05,321
So, I am promoting you
to floor manager.

1764
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:07,573
This is the bullshit
of all bullshits!

1765
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,617
You scumbag! Ass kisser!

1766
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,662
Thank you. That's great.

1767
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:17,708
I understand you have a girlfriend.
Yeah, kind of seeing somebody.

1768
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:20,795
I'm very happy for you.
Thanks. She's great.

1769
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:22,546
Are you still a virgin?

1770
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:25,091
You know, I don't really...

1771
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:27,093
talk about my personal life.
You're a virgin.

1772
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:28,511
Yes, I am.
Yeah.

1773
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,639
My door is always open.

1774
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,016
So to speak.
Great.

1775
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:36,894
Great. Thank you.

1776
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,355
I'm very discreet.

1777
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:44,610
But I'll haunt your dreams.

1778
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:47,863
Okay.
Okay.

1779
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,620
Wow.

1780
01:28:56,498 --> 01:29:00,543
So who's gonna take my job? Cal
will be taking over your job.

1781
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,461
And he's interviewing people
right now...

1782
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:03,796
for his old job.

1783
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,923
So, have you ever worked
with electronics before?

1784
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,133
No.
No?

1785
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:10,594
But I have electronics
in my home.

1786
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,641
Perfect. That's the job pretty
much. You're very well-qualified.

1787
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:17,810
More than these other losers.

1788
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,981
I could do that...
Wait, last thing.

1789
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,108
I'm also gonna need that
extended warranty on it...

1790
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,527
for the price of
"on the house. "

1791
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:29,780
That I can't do.

1792
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:32,533
Hey, don't be a Negro. Be my
nigger. All right? Help me out.

1793
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,702
Hold up.
I ain't nobody's nigger.

1794
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:38,414
I mean, you somebody's nigger
wearing this nigger tie.

1795
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:39,999
Now you being condescending.

1796
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:43,586
See, you've been warned, all
right? Just move forward amicably.

1797
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,004
Okay. Well, check this out.

1798
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:47,173
First of all, you're throwing
too many big words at me.

1799
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:48,966
Okay, now because
I don't understand them...

1800
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,509
I'm gonna take them
as disrespect.

1801
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,928
Watch your mouth,
and help me with the sale.

1802
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:55,681
Okay, see, now you
found yourself a nigger.

1803
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:58,601
You were looking for a nigger?
Nigger here now. See?

1804
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:01,979
Today's forecast: Dark and
cloudy, and chance of drive-by.

1805
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:04,148
You want to go?
I suggest you move back.

1806
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,858
Then, nig, fire on.

1807
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,234
What are we gonna do?

1808
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:10,529
What are you gonna do,
Mr. Floor Manager?

1809
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:13,157
Go, get them, tiger.

1810
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,867
This shit just got rigged.

1811
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:16,869
What are you gonna do, bitch?
I'll tell you what.

1812
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:18,871
You know Luca Perry
from 20th and 25th?

1813
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:20,706
You ever heard of,
Rolling 20s, nigger?

1814
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:23,167
Since I was 16, nigger,
I'm saying "frosty. "

1815
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,877
You know what I'm saying,
"spoon", nigger.

1816
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:26,629
We fucked dwarfs in the ass.

1817
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:28,631
Nigger, this dwarf here
don't got to be tall...

1818
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:30,466
to pull the trigger off
in somebody face!

1819
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,801
Come on nigger, back
up. What's up? Hey...

1820
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:34,094
Welcome to Smart Tech.

1821
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,554
Is this your boy?
What can I help you with?

1822
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:37,348
Yeah, nigger,
we will both mash you!

1823
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,141
How can we help you, sir?
Nigger, what?

1824
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,560
No, he don't need no help.
He's already been served.

1825
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:44,521
I served him. He's taken care of.
He's a little slow, but he got it.

1826
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:47,274
See, what he thought was he can
come up in here and make the rules.

1827
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:49,735
But now he see that Jay

1828
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:52,696
that I run this bitch
and now he bought the bounce.

1829
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,240
This your boy?

1830
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:57,910
Yeah, that's my boy.
We represent Smart Tech.

1831
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,411
You just got
fucked up with him.

1832
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:02,039
Both y'all niggers going get
clapped up when I get back.

1833
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,333
Both of you all niggers.

1834
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,543
What did I do?
It don't fucking matter!

1835
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:09,964
Yeah, aim high, Willis.
Aim high!

1836
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,507
Please don't do this.

1837
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,468
Jay, what's going on?

1838
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:17,930
Jill broke up with me.

1839
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:20,516
I'm so sorry.
What happened?

1840
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:22,851
I came home a little tipsy.

1841
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,521
And I had one of my condoms
on still.

1842
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:30,859
Woke up the next morning and
jumped in the shower with her.

1843
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:33,445
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1844
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:34,738
Why did you cheat on her?

1845
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:37,116
Because I'm insecure!
You can't tell?

1846
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,576
I know, man.
It's gonna be okay.

1847
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,787
I'm cold.
It's gonna be all right, man.

1848
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,497
Seriously, man, I'm sorry.

1849
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:45,499
I apologize to you. I know.

1850
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,418
If you wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

1851
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,712
you've got to leave the sex
out of it, man. You're right.

1852
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:50,963
It's all right. You're good.

1853
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,881
I'm sorry. Come here.
I love you, man.

1854
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:54,466
Man, I love you, too.

1855
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:57,344
You're a good guy.

1856
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,890
Do you know how I know
you guys are gay?

1857
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:04,393
You're holding each other
ever so gently.

1858
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:05,477
Cabrn.

1859
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:13,068
Bravo.

1860
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,154
At least he can cook, Mom.

1861
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:19,241
? playing)

1862
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:21,952
I love... Spiderman.

1863
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:37,509
Pull out slowly
and go straight ahead.

1864
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:07,289
I'm all right.

1865
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:08,916
Nobody's there.

1866
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:11,335
I want to know
everything about you.

1867
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:12,461
I want to tell you.

1868
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:13,545
You do?
Yeah.

1869
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,465
Like, what do you want to do?
What are your dreams?

1870
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:19,885
You don't wanna work at Smart
Tech for the rest of your life.

1871
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,554
I've been working there
for a long time.

1872
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:26,308
And I've been thinking lately that
maybe I should open my own store.

1873
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:27,643
Really?
Yeah.

1874
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:31,146
What kind of store?
Well, like a stereo store.

1875
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:33,565
Oh, my God, that is...
Why don't you do that?

1876
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,317
I don't have enough money
to do that.

1877
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,860
What about those collectibles?

1878
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:39,196
I bet if you sold those,
you could make a lot of money.

1879
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,117
I just sold a guy's G. I. Joe
for $1,000.

1880
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:44,910
Really?
Do you have any of those?

1881
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:46,120
Yeah.
You do?

1882
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:47,246
I have 47 of them.

1883
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,497
No, you don't.

1884
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,582
Yeah, in their original boxes. You do?

1885
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:52,751
I could help you
sell them on eBay.

1886
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:55,921
I would not take a commission,
I swear to God.

1887
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:59,091
You could do it.
You could totally pull it off.

1888
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:02,594
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's do it.

1889
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:21,947
Aquaman.

1890
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:23,490
Here.

1891
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,325
Clothes on.

1892
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,037
I'll send you off to...

1893
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:33,000
a farm with lots of land.

1894
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,878
So, you and other Aquamen
can run around...

1895
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:39,464
and play in the Aquafields.

1896
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,727
Godspeed, Col. Steve Austin.

1897
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,565
You don't wanna go, do you?
Okay, you can stay.

1898
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,525
Steve Austin can stay.

1899
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:03,989
Hey, Cal. David.

1900
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,408
Way to sell a big TV.

1901
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:07,993
She likes you, man.

1902
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:10,204
Too bad I retired my penis.

1903
01:35:10,496 --> 01:35:13,707
Mooj, we try to be fair with
the schedule but it's hard.

1904
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,419
Okay, but why every damn schedule
comes up, I get most early shift?

1905
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:20,339
It's bullshit. Nobody buys
stereo at 10:00 in the morning.

1906
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:21,465
No, I understand.

1907
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:24,468
People buy stereo
between 6:00 and 8:00.

1908
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,552
Mmm-hmm.

1909
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:29,097
Rich men get off work,
then buy stereo.

1910
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:31,683
Right.
Not after fucking brunch.

1911
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:33,393
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.

1912
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:36,063
I'm going to give you
a couple of Jay's shifts.

1913
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:38,774
And then I'll give you a
couple of mine and that way

1914
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:42,027
we'll all be equal, okay.
Thank you, Andy.

1915
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:43,487
It's okay.

1916
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:45,447
You're a good man, Andy.

1917
01:35:47,617 --> 01:35:50,535
By the way,
what date are you on, now?

1918
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:53,497
I think it's around 17.

1919
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:56,333
It's hard to tell what actually
constitutes a date, though.

1920
01:35:56,417 --> 01:36:00,295
Three to go. So that means you're
gonna have sex in three days.

1921
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,382
Maybe, I might try to
space them out a little bit.

1922
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:06,009
I'll pray for your cock.
Okay, thanks.

1923
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,262
Thanks. Thank you.
Have a good cocky.

1924
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:11,014
Trish is on the phone.
Here is a shock.

1925
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:13,058
Girlfriend with a problem.
Hello.

1926
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:15,477
I have done everything
but sex!

1927
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:18,021
I'm a wom an, okay?
Deal with it!

1928
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:20,190
I'm gonna start
taking you back to church.

1929
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:22,192
We are gonna start
going to church.

1930
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:23,777
Hello?
You know what?

1931
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:25,195
What the hell
are you talking about?

1932
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:27,906
Oh, my God, I cannot believe
this. Thank God you're here.

1933
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:31,034
Jesus Christ. Marla locked
herself in the bathroom.

1934
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,035
What happened?

1935
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,870
She wants to go
to the family health clinic.

1936
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:35,998
She wants birth control.
But she's too young.

1937
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:39,251
I want to have sex with my
boyfriend! But I can't, Mom!

1938
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:40,627
So, you want me
to take her?

1939
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,754
No, I don't want you to
take her. Okay, all right.

1940
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:45,674
I want her to keep it in her
pants until she gets to college.

1941
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:46,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1942
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:48,135
"Keep it in my pants"?

1943
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:50,846
Okay, you didn't keep it
in your pants, Mom.

1944
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:54,391
I know. I don't want you to make
the same mistakes as me, Marla.

1945
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:57,477
Mistakes? Okay,
so I was a mistake then.

1946
01:36:57,562 --> 01:37:01,481
No, you're not a mistake.
Your sister was the mistake.

1947
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:03,692
Oh, my God!

1948
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,903
Her older sister, I mean, she
wasn't planned, you know what I mean?

1949
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:09,531
Because I was such a... Oh, God,
you wanna run away, don't you?

1950
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:10,657
No.

1951
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:13,577
You and your boyfriend
have sex all the time!

1952
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:15,370
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding?

1953
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:17,247
We never have sex.
Do we ever have sex?

1954
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:18,665
No, we don't.

1955
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,751
What? Yes, you do!

1956
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:23,503
You're such a liar!
Why do you lie to me?

1957
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:24,588
Why?

1958
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:30,093
I didn't hear anything
after "a liar. "

1959
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:33,055
What did she say after "a liar"?
She sounds like a tea kettle.

1960
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:35,015
Fuck you!

1961
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:39,811
Maybe I should take her.
No, I don't think so.

1962
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:42,355
You know, a little information
never hurt anybody.

1963
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,454
Cool.

1964
01:37:58,539 --> 01:37:59,581
Wow!

1965
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:04,169
Where do you put the penis?

1966
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:06,505
Oh, shit.

1967
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,558
It is

1968
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:21,019
not a Rubik's Cube.

1969
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:24,689
Shit.

1970
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,485
God, how much longer
are they gonna make us wait?

1971
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:31,113
I don't know. They should be
out in a second.

1972
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:32,614
Now, you're all here

1973
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:35,075
because you're interested
in obtaining birth control.

1974
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,409
Any questions?

1975
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:39,329
Here's a cute story.
I came home the other day

1976
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:42,415
and he is with his girlfriend
in my marital bed

1977
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,418
doing things that are illegal
in Alabama.

1978
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:48,880
Sex acts, right? Things
that my wife won't do, okay?

1979
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:52,134
Did you have a question? How
do I get my wife to do that?

1980
01:38:52,218 --> 01:38:53,635
Does anybody else
have a question?

1981
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:57,055
My daughter is,
for lack of a better word,

1982
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:58,557
dumb.

1983
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,976
How do I stop
her menstrual cycle?

1984
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,311
You want her to stop
having a menstrual cycle?

1985
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:06,022
I want to stop it,
maybe just for a few years.

1986
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:08,275
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1987
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:11,486
Does anybody else have a
question? I have a question.

1988
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:15,407
I think some of the people here
might be sexually inexperienced.

1989
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:19,077
Is it true that if you
don't use it, you lose it?

1990
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,037
Is that a serious question?

1991
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:22,789
No. It wasn't.
Okay.

1992
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:27,002
Now, there are a lot of
activities that you can engage in

1993
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:29,921
without having sex
that are both fun and safe.

1994
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:32,090
What sort of activities?
I think

1995
01:39:32,175 --> 01:39:34,384
everybody wants to know
about the activities.

1996
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:39,055
Well, instead of having intercourse,
you could have outer-course.

1997
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:41,641
Outer-course?
What's that?

1998
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,101
Yeah, what is that?

1999
01:39:43,186 --> 01:39:47,314
Outer-course is anything that
isn't vaginal intercourse.

2000
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:49,608
I prefer
vaginal intercourse.

2001
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:52,611
He really does.

2002
01:39:52,945 --> 01:39:56,489
Now, there are ways of having
sex without intercourse.

2003
01:39:57,617 --> 01:40:01,036
Let's see, there are things
like body rubbing or dry humping.

2004
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,412
You could dry hump.

2005
01:40:02,496 --> 01:40:05,624
There is masturbation.
Masturbation. Play with yourself.

2006
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:07,709
Mutual masturbation.
Play with a friend.

2007
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:11,379
Deep kissing.
There is erotic massage.

2008
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:13,340
That sounds like
it would be nice.

2009
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:16,009
Oral sex play.
Sounds like my Friday night.

2010
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:17,969
Shut up, Seth.
We went to temple.

2011
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:19,846
Okay,
are there any virgins here

2012
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:22,641
who are thinking about
having sex for the first time?

2013
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:24,893
Oh.

2014
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:27,479
Wait. So you're
a virgin?

2015
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:32,901
I'd tap that.
Oh, yeah, you'd "tap that"?

2016
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:35,904
Seth, what, you think you're
cool with your little Jew fro?

2017
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:39,241
We don't say, "tap that. " What
are you talking about, Seth?

2018
01:40:39,325 --> 01:40:41,576
You know what,
I'm a virgin, too.

2019
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:44,746
That's...

2020
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:46,706
We're virgins, too.
Yeah.

2021
01:40:48,668 --> 01:40:51,586
No, you know what,
it's a personal choice

2022
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:53,213
and I don't think
it's weird at all.

2023
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:54,547
You know what
your problem is?

2024
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:56,341
You're putting the pussy
on a pedestal.

2025
01:40:56,425 --> 01:40:58,134
That's the second time
I've heard that.

2026
01:40:58,219 --> 01:41:00,136
What is the
"pussy on a pedestal" thing?

2027
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:04,099
Okay, I can't listen to anymore of
this, 'cause it's making me sick.

2028
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:05,141
So, bye.

2029
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,352
You can get this information
on your website, right?

2030
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:09,187
Yes. Thanks. Nice meeting everybody.

2031
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:10,397
Any other questions?

2032
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,399
Do you have any
extra-large condoms?

2033
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:14,317
Seth, you got
a tiny penis.

2034
01:41:18,406 --> 01:41:21,533
So, I made that all up
to help you out.

2035
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,161
No, you didn't.

2036
01:41:25,371 --> 01:41:28,707
But thank you
for doing that.

2037
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:33,211
How can you tell?

2038
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:35,797
Well, you know, I go to school
with, like, 400 guys

2039
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:37,299
who are all trying
to have sex.

2040
01:41:37,383 --> 01:41:39,342
And, yeah,
so I can tell who's done it.

2041
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:40,468
Of course.

2042
01:41:40,553 --> 01:41:43,471
And you really haven't?
No, I really haven't.

2043
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:46,349
Please don't tell your mom,
okay?

2044
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:48,184
Yeah, I won't.
Thanks.

2045
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:51,438
But when are you
gonna tell her?

2046
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,606
Believe me,
I'm working on it.

2047
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:56,568
I am working on it.

2048
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:00,947
Do you have any weed?

2049
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,159
Yeah.
You do have some.

2050
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:06,369
Can spare any
or is it all spoken for?

2051
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:09,080
I mean, like what
are we talking? Are we...

2052
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:11,624
Just enough to get me
baked for like a week.

2053
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:12,917
That's a lot of weed.

2054
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:14,919
Yeah, I am taking vacation
next week, so...

2055
01:42:15,004 --> 01:42:16,838
Where are you going?
I'm not going anywhere.

2056
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:18,673
I'll stay in my apartment.
Just getting baked?

2057
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:20,258
I want to be baked
the whole time.

2058
01:42:20,343 --> 01:42:22,719
Watch TV,
I'll probably re-watch Gandhi.

2059
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:25,263
Gandhi baked is good.
Yes, isn't it?

2060
01:42:25,348 --> 01:42:26,973
I always feel bad
when I watch it baked

2061
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:28,975
'cause I get really hungry
and I'm eating a lot

2062
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:30,060
and poor Gandhi is

2063
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,853
fucking starving his ass off.
Starving, I know.

2064
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:36,983
Sounds good.
Yeah.

2065
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:39,778
I'm going to take her to
capacity. Are you okay with that?

2066
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:41,196
Give it a shot.

2067
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,406
Freak! Oh, yeah!

2068
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:47,702
Michael McDonald, man,
I haven't heard this in years.

2069
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:49,954
Yeah, I haven't heard it
in like 48 minutes.

2070
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:53,375
If I get the set,
will you throw in the DVD?

2071
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,752
You don't get the set.
I'll throw in the DVD.

2072
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:57,295
I'll take it.

2073
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,172
Really?
Yeah.

2074
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:02,258
Y'all want to see something
beautiful? Come here.

2075
01:43:02,343 --> 01:43:05,512
You want to see the most beautiful
thing in the world? Check this out.

2076
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:09,307
This is my baby right here.
That's my baby's dick right there.

2077
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:11,684
Looks like a poltergeist.

2078
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:13,269
That is his foot.

2079
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:15,688
Look at his dick.
That's not even four months.

2080
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:17,065
Extrapolate that.

2081
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:19,526
By the time he's 30,
what's gonna happen?

2082
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,861
Yo, Andy! Come check this out,
dawg.

2083
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:24,531
Is this the movie about babies
that are geniuses?

2084
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:27,075
No, this is my child, dude.
Jill is pregnant.

2085
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:28,284
That's yours?
Yeah.

2086
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:30,370
That's why she broke up
with me in the first place...

2087
01:43:30,454 --> 01:43:32,705
'cause she just thought that
I wouldn't be a good father...

2088
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:35,083
in light of the fact that I'd
be cheating on her all the time.

2089
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:36,876
But she got over all that.
It's cool now.

2090
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:38,878
Congratulations, man.
That is great.

2091
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,713
We having
a party tonight, Andy...

2092
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:42,340
and I really want you
to be there, man.

2093
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:44,884
We celebrating and I really,
really want you to be there.

2094
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,470
It looks like
the Doppler radar.

2095
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:48,596
Can you believe that?

2096
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:50,306
This child
ain't even four months old.

2097
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:52,642
He ain't four months old yet.
Look at what he's packing.

2098
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:55,228
Everybody dick looks big
on 60-inch TV.

2099
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:57,897
My sister's dick looks big
on TV, okay?

2100
01:43:58,858 --> 01:44:01,526
Oh, my God,
this guy, Eric Gilliland...

2101
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:04,571
he has bought, like,
15 of these. Really?

2102
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:07,615
Yeah, I think he likes action
figures even more than you.

2103
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:10,243
That is impossible.
I think so.

2104
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:14,414
Andy, the way these things
are flying off your shelf...

2105
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:17,459
you know, I think you
could actually make like...

2106
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,502
maybe like $100,000.

2107
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:21,754
Really? Yeah, you could open your store.

2108
01:44:21,839 --> 01:44:23,214
Wow.
Honey...

2109
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:25,508
That's a lot of money.
I know.

2110
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:28,261
That's incredible. I wouldn't
have done it without you.

2111
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:29,512
Thanks.

2112
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:33,016
And that's not the only good news. What?

2113
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:36,394
You know what tonight is?
Survivor is on?

2114
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,230
No.
I know.

2115
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:42,400
Is it The Aqqrentice?

2116
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,360
No.

2117
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:46,196
What?

2118
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:53,244
It's our 20th date.

2119
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:01,211
Wow.
Yeah.

2120
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:02,629
Really?
Uh-huh.

2121
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:05,965
Seriously?
I think we're at 18.

2122
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:07,759
'Cause there were
a couple of dates there...

2123
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:09,719
that don't really count as dates. No.

2124
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:12,472
I'll give you a free pass
on those other ones.

2125
01:45:13,516 --> 01:45:14,641
Thank you.

2126
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:15,850
Listen.
What?

2127
01:45:15,935 --> 01:45:17,185
Listen.
Mmm-hmm.

2128
01:45:18,687 --> 01:45:20,313
I really like you.

2129
01:45:26,278 --> 01:45:28,071
I think I'm falling for you.

2130
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:32,700
I don't know. I kind of see
this going somewhere.

2131
01:45:33,035 --> 01:45:34,244
I do, too.

2132
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:37,539
I just think we should just
go crazy on each other.

2133
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,750
Okay.
Okay?

2134
01:45:41,627 --> 01:45:42,919
Oh, thank God!

2135
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:46,714
Oh!

2136
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:49,801
Okay, I should...
I gotta pick those up.

2137
01:45:49,885 --> 01:45:51,010
Don't pick them up now.

2138
01:45:51,095 --> 01:45:52,387
No, I have to pick those up
right now.

2139
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:54,556
Wait, we'll get them later.
Listen, no, I can't, no.

2140
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,266
Listen, it's really important
because...

2141
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:58,601
once the integrity of the box
gets compromised...

2142
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:00,979
This is original packaging
and that's why these things...

2143
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:03,147
are so valuable.
So you don't screw with that.

2144
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:05,275
You really don't screw
with that. All right.

2145
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,402
We can wrap them again later,
you know.

2146
01:46:07,486 --> 01:46:08,861
Yeah, I know.
But you know what...

2147
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:11,030
this is very important that
we don't lose the value...

2148
01:46:11,115 --> 01:46:12,448
and compromise
the integrity of it.

2149
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:14,742
Andy, I'm throwing myself
at you and...

2150
01:46:14,827 --> 01:46:16,869
all you can think about
is a fucking toy.

2151
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:20,039
They're not fucking toys!
This is Iron Man, okay?

2152
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:22,542
I got this
when I was in second grade.

2153
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:25,420
Do you know how hard it is
for a kid to not open that?

2154
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,713
This is important.

2155
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:28,089
These are my things...

2156
01:46:28,173 --> 01:46:31,467
and you are trying to make me
sell them and I don't want to.

2157
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,885
No.
And you're making me.

2158
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:35,054
I'm not making...
You are encouraging me...

2159
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:37,265
to quit my job.
I'm not! I'm not trying to...

2160
01:46:37,349 --> 01:46:40,059
You want me to open a store.
You want me to sell everything.

2161
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:41,894
You know what,
I'm gonna tell you something.

2162
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:45,189
I don't just change like that.
I can't just change for you.

2163
01:46:45,274 --> 01:46:48,067
I don't... I'm not trying
to change you. I like you.

2164
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:50,278
I'm just... I'm trying
to help you grow up, Andy.

2165
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:52,030
Well, thanks a lot.

2166
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:56,117
I mean, my God, you ride a
bicycle to work in a stockroom.

2167
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:58,536
You know what, I'm not
in the stockroom anymore.

2168
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:00,079
I'm a floor manager.
Okay.

2169
01:47:00,164 --> 01:47:03,207
And I ride a bike because I
like to. Einstein rode a bike.

2170
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:06,002
He had a wife who he fucked,
by the way.

2171
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:08,921
What do I have to do
for you to have sex with me?

2172
01:47:09,006 --> 01:47:11,507
Do you want me to dress up like
Thor? I'll dress up like Thor.

2173
01:47:11,592 --> 01:47:13,176
I'll dress up like Iron Man.

2174
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,969
What do they do?
I'll do it.

2175
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:16,929
What? Everything's always
about sex.

2176
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,598
Why don't you want
to have sex with me?

2177
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:21,100
Why not? Tell me.
You tell me the truth.

2178
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:23,394
Is it because I have a kid
who has a kid? Is that why?

2179
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:24,979
No, it's cool that
you're a grandmother.

2180
01:47:25,064 --> 01:47:26,689
I love the fact
that you're a grandmother.

2181
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:29,317
Oh, God! You are. You're a hot grandma.

2182
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:30,568
Oh, my God!

2183
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:32,737
You are so mean! Get out!

2184
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,531
Okay, fine. Good!
Good, fine. You're gonna go.

2185
01:47:35,616 --> 01:47:38,993
I didn't ask for any of this.
You asked for all of it, Andy.

2186
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:40,787
Okay. Great.

2187
01:47:43,957 --> 01:47:44,957
Okay.

2188
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:46,918
That's the way
you want it

2189
01:47:47,002 --> 01:47:49,921
that's the way
homie's gonna play it.

2190
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:52,715
Yeah. Truth be told.

2191
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:12,318
Baby, you better
enjoy yourself tonight

2192
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:14,696
'cause once this baby's born,
you ain't going out again

2193
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:15,822
till that baby is in college.

2194
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:17,115
Me?
Yeah.

2195
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,534
You the club rat. I'm not
the one that be going out.

2196
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:21,369
I'm not a club rat.

2197
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,205
You're gonna get up,
you march over there

2198
01:48:24,289 --> 01:48:26,791
and I want you
to hit on Bernadette now.

2199
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:29,043
Dude, I'm not gonna hit
on Bernadette.

2200
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:30,253
Yes, you are, man,

2201
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:32,922
'cause your depression
is boring me for one thing

2202
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:34,966
and it's actually making me
a little depressed

2203
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:37,009
which is then in turn
making me more depressed

2204
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:38,845
that you're actually
affecting my mood.

2205
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:42,265
Look, I'm not in any kind of place
to talk to a woman, all right?

2206
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:44,517
I'm just... I'm fragile.

2207
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:46,519
I hired her for you.

2208
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:50,189
I hired a 90-pound girl to work
in the stockroom at Smart Tech

2209
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:51,816
for you, okay?

2210
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,401
I should have hired
a 300-pound guy

2211
01:48:53,485 --> 01:48:55,069
who could lift
a 60-inch flat screen.

2212
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:57,655
But instead
I hired a hot girl

2213
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:01,117
who can't lift an iPod
to bring you out of your funk.

2214
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:03,411
You hired her for me?
Yes.

2215
01:49:03,495 --> 01:49:04,912
So will you go talk to her?

2216
01:49:04,997 --> 01:49:06,831
Yeah, I'm meeting somebody.

2217
01:49:06,999 --> 01:49:07,999
No.

2218
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:13,755
Did you just flick me in the nuts? No.

2219
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:16,841
Flicked you in the fleshy patch
where your nuts used to be.

2220
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:19,802
Quit flicking my balls, man.

2221
01:49:19,887 --> 01:49:22,430
Okay, I'll stop
flicking your balls.

2222
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:24,932
But I'll start punching
your nuts.

2223
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:26,851
Oh!

2224
01:49:27,519 --> 01:49:28,686
Okay.

2225
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:33,858
Well played, sir.

2226
01:49:34,234 --> 01:49:35,401
Okay.
Thank you.

2227
01:49:35,486 --> 01:49:37,612
No problem, man.
Go get 'em.

2228
01:49:38,197 --> 01:49:39,947
Mooj, you done
see my son,

2229
01:49:40,032 --> 01:49:41,657
you know his foot gonna be
bigger than this.

2230
01:49:41,742 --> 01:49:44,952
If that baby looks Pakistani,
don't fucking look at me, okay?

2231
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:48,623
I wouldn't mind. You got good
genes. How old are you? What, 138?

2232
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:51,626
When your son is born,
is he already in parole?

2233
01:49:59,968 --> 01:50:03,346
I need some poon.

2234
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:06,682
You guys were so right,
right from the beginning.

2235
01:50:06,975 --> 01:50:11,646
I need genital to genital
connection and that's all I need.

2236
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:15,650
You know, the thing about
relationships is that they

2237
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:17,568
make one person go...

2238
01:50:19,154 --> 01:50:21,364
And the other person go,
"What are you talking about?"

2239
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:22,657
And then one person goes...

2240
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:25,910
How much have you had
to drink, man?

2241
01:50:25,994 --> 01:50:29,497
How much have I had to drink?
How many pots have you smoken?

2242
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:30,706
What are you
talking about?

2243
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:34,043
How many times have you gone
to the bathroom in your life?

2244
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:35,336
Let me ask you that.

2245
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:38,381
You know what, you don't have
an answer for that, do you?

2246
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:40,049
Fuck you, man! I'm sorry.

2247
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:43,344
No, you're such a good guy,
and I appreciate you.

2248
01:50:43,428 --> 01:50:45,388
What's up, baby, I didn't know
you had came already.

2249
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,640
Hey, motherfucker!

2250
01:50:50,018 --> 01:50:52,103
Man, you know what,
tonight is the night.

2251
01:50:52,187 --> 01:50:56,899
You know what, you were
totally right and I was wrong.

2252
01:50:57,109 --> 01:51:01,696
You were right all along.
You cannot have a relationship

2253
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:03,948
with somebody until

2254
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:07,034
you have sex
and that's the long...

2255
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,870
That's the long
and short of it.

2256
01:51:08,954 --> 01:51:12,415
So, thank you.
That's good.

2257
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:15,710
And now I have to go hunt
for some hos.

2258
01:51:18,589 --> 01:51:21,883
He going to be all right?
No, I don't think he is.

2259
01:51:22,009 --> 01:51:24,343
Cal's a good guy.
Yeah, he's a great guy.

2260
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:26,178
It's so funny, because,
you know,

2261
01:51:26,263 --> 01:51:29,056
when I first met him and I
thought you were cute at the store,

2262
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:32,143
he told me you were gay.
I'm not gay.

2263
01:51:32,477 --> 01:51:35,104
Cal says that I'm gay because
he has a real problem

2264
01:51:35,188 --> 01:51:37,523
with his own gayness.

2265
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:40,902
But seriously, I'm going to
lay it out for you, right now.

2266
01:51:41,528 --> 01:51:43,863
I was a little reticent
to come over and talk to you.

2267
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:46,741
You're very pretty and you
seem very nice. The truth is

2268
01:51:46,825 --> 01:51:50,494
I dated this woman, let me
rephrase that, I dated this whore

2269
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:52,622
who stomped
all over my heart.

2270
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:55,583
And it's just taking me
a little while to kind of,

2271
01:51:55,667 --> 01:51:57,251
you know,
get back in the game.

2272
01:51:57,336 --> 01:51:58,753
Oh, my God. Say no more.

2273
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:01,464
My last boyfriend Sal junior,
is a scum bag.

2274
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:03,716
I would totally pay people
to have him killed.

2275
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,927
That's how much I fucking hate
that damn scum bag.

2276
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:08,179
God, you're fucking awesome.
You too.

2277
01:52:10,015 --> 01:52:11,933
Hey, you!

2278
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:15,728
Hey.
Hey.

2279
01:52:16,021 --> 01:52:17,521
How you doing?

2280
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:20,524
Much better,
now that I'm talking to you.

2281
01:52:20,776 --> 01:52:23,361
Hey, lookie,
I can see through your shirt.

2282
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:25,404
Nice.

2283
01:52:26,615 --> 01:52:29,325
So, you think we should

2284
01:52:29,618 --> 01:52:32,203
take this party
to my apartment or what?

2285
01:52:32,704 --> 01:52:35,748
I am RSVPing "yes. "

2286
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:42,672
Hope you have a big trunk
because I'm putting my bike in it.

2287
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:47,009
Yeah, let's go!

2288
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,725
Mom, I left my phone somewhere
and I...

2289
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:56,560
Thank you.

2290
01:52:57,896 --> 01:53:01,190
What's the matter?
Where is Andy?

2291
01:53:01,316 --> 01:53:04,235
We had a big fight, just...
Oh, Mom.

2292
01:53:04,736 --> 01:53:06,821
He just
stormed out of here.

2293
01:53:06,905 --> 01:53:07,989
What happened?

2294
01:53:08,073 --> 01:53:10,700
Well, I just... Wait a minute,
I thought you hated him.

2295
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,328
I don't hate him. I mean,
he does do magic, but,

2296
01:53:14,413 --> 01:53:16,789
you know, he's a big dork

2297
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:19,500
and I like seeing you happy.

2298
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:22,378
I do.

2299
01:53:24,297 --> 01:53:26,799
That's sweet, that's really sweet. Mom.

2300
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:30,428
Why don't you just go
talk to him, work it out.

2301
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:33,347
'Cause if the thing is that
important, you can't just stop.

2302
01:53:34,099 --> 01:53:36,308
Let me dance for you.
I would love it.

2303
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:41,397
Look at your bra and your breasts
and everything. That's so great.

2304
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:45,901
Wow! You know what?
You're so hot. You're so hot.

2305
01:53:46,194 --> 01:53:47,820
I'm smoking hot.

2306
01:53:47,904 --> 01:53:50,740
You know what? I'm just going
to have sex with you.

2307
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:52,908
Yes! Let's have sex.

2308
01:53:52,993 --> 01:53:55,202
It's going to happen.
That's why we are here.

2309
01:53:55,287 --> 01:53:57,663
That's totally what's going
to happen.

2310
01:53:57,914 --> 01:54:00,041
We could do it in the...

2311
01:54:01,043 --> 01:54:02,710
Butt, if you want to.

2312
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:06,338
But, if I want to what?

2313
01:54:06,798 --> 01:54:09,842
Butt.
But what? What?

2314
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:11,969
Do it.
Do it?

2315
01:54:12,137 --> 01:54:13,137
What?

2316
01:54:13,638 --> 01:54:16,474
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2317
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,642
Butt.
But...

2318
01:54:18,894 --> 01:54:20,227
What?
... what?

2319
01:54:23,231 --> 01:54:25,524
But, it still feels so right.

2320
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:39,455
Yeah!

2321
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:45,795
Yeah. Right! Okay. Yeah.

2322
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:48,964
That was a fun day.

2323
01:54:50,509 --> 01:54:53,594
You are so kinky.

2324
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:56,013
Yeah, I'm so kinky.

2325
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:59,767
That's why I did this
because I thought it looks...

2326
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:02,353
You like to shave, don't you?

2327
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:05,231
Let's shave each other. I
don't think you have any hair.

2328
01:55:05,315 --> 01:55:07,108
You know where to shave me.

2329
01:55:07,192 --> 01:55:09,276
Yeah.
Because I want to shave you.

2330
01:55:09,361 --> 01:55:11,028
I want to shave your head.

2331
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:14,156
I wanna give you
a buzz cut.

2332
01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:16,867
Let's get in the bath.

2333
01:55:17,202 --> 01:55:18,702
In the bath?

2334
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:23,165
Yes. We're gonna get dirty.
Dirty, dirty. Sudsy.

2335
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:25,292
It's just about time
I got really dirty.

2336
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:26,418
Yeah.

2337
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:33,968
Hey. Hi, it's me, and I'm
on my way to your house.

2338
01:55:34,052 --> 01:55:36,387
I want to do whatever
you want to do, okay?

2339
01:55:36,555 --> 01:55:40,432
Fifty dates. 100.
I hope not, but whatever.

2340
01:55:41,059 --> 01:55:43,811
I'm gonna see you soon,
okay? Bye.

2341
01:55:47,858 --> 01:55:50,776
Wow. Okay, well,
that was fast. Okay.

2342
01:55:53,238 --> 01:55:56,198
Wow! Holy shit!

2343
01:55:56,449 --> 01:55:59,034
Wow. This is just
the right thing to happen.

2344
01:55:59,536 --> 01:56:02,913
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Wow!
Almost got my penis.

2345
01:56:02,998 --> 01:56:04,415
Come to mama.

2346
01:56:06,001 --> 01:56:08,794
I'm gonna really take care
of you tonight.

2347
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:11,589
You're never
gonna forget Beth.

2348
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:23,767
I just want to please you.

2349
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:26,187
What do you like?

2350
01:56:27,022 --> 01:56:30,107
I don't know.
What do you like?

2351
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:32,776
Can I show you what I like?

2352
01:56:33,278 --> 01:56:34,361
Okay.

2353
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:50,794
It's so hot in here.

2354
01:56:51,546 --> 01:56:53,923
I wanna introduce you
to my friend.

2355
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:00,304
Your friend is so shiny.

2356
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:04,308
This guy knows exactly
what I like.

2357
01:57:09,648 --> 01:57:11,357
Where's you friend going?

2358
01:57:13,193 --> 01:57:15,819
This is how I'm gonna
warm up for you.

2359
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:20,950
That's always good to warm up.
You don't wanna pull something.

2360
01:57:38,593 --> 01:57:40,970
Wow, this is graphic.

2361
01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:56,277
I can't do it.

2362
01:57:57,904 --> 01:58:00,572
God, what are you
doing here?

2363
01:58:00,657 --> 01:58:03,284
We came here because we were
concerned about you and Trish

2364
01:58:03,368 --> 01:58:05,494
and now I could not give
a fuck.

2365
01:58:05,578 --> 01:58:08,205
How did you even know
where she lives?

2366
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:10,624
I hit it like eight months back. What?

2367
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:13,460
Never gave her back the key,
man. You have no idea

2368
01:58:13,545 --> 01:58:15,587
where this is going, all
right? That girl is a freak.

2369
01:58:15,672 --> 01:58:19,133
Oh, it's happening!
It's happening! Andy!

2370
01:58:19,551 --> 01:58:20,759
You think?

2371
01:58:21,052 --> 01:58:23,304
We've been talking,
and look,

2372
01:58:23,722 --> 01:58:26,015
if you love Trish,
you can't do this.

2373
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:29,143
Look, you guys, I don't
know what I'm doing anymore.

2374
01:58:29,227 --> 01:58:31,812
I don't even know who I am.
All I know is

2375
01:58:31,896 --> 01:58:35,399
that woman
scares the shit out of me

2376
01:58:35,567 --> 01:58:37,776
and I just wanna go home,
okay?

2377
01:58:37,986 --> 01:58:40,279
Let's go.
We should all get out of here.

2378
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:42,072
Okay.
We should all go.

2379
01:58:42,157 --> 01:58:43,532
It wasn't that good
for me.

2380
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:45,492
We should totally
get out of here.

2381
01:58:45,577 --> 01:58:47,786
We should run away
from here.

2382
01:58:54,252 --> 01:58:55,294
Hey.

2383
01:58:56,796 --> 01:58:57,880
Cal.

2384
01:59:00,633 --> 01:59:02,343
Go around!

2385
01:59:03,261 --> 01:59:05,346
Come on,
just go around me!

2386
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:10,225
Can't you hear me?

2387
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:20,778
Hey, there. Hi, Trish.

2388
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:24,907
Man, I'm really sorry
about tonight.

2389
01:59:24,991 --> 01:59:26,408
What's this?

2390
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:29,078
Those are David's.

2391
01:59:31,164 --> 01:59:32,956
I think he has a problem.

2392
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:35,542
These are David's?
He's into that.

2393
01:59:35,668 --> 01:59:39,129
David's Boner Jams '03?

2394
01:59:39,756 --> 01:59:41,799
Yeah, it's so sad.

2395
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:45,302
He compiled all the best
boner scenes, I guess.

2396
01:59:46,221 --> 01:59:48,555
This isn't what it looks like,
okay?

2397
01:59:49,015 --> 01:59:52,142
What does this look like?
A vagina.

2398
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:54,728
And what do you do
with this vagina?

2399
01:59:54,813 --> 01:59:57,773
To learn.
It's for medicinal purposes.

2400
01:59:57,857 --> 01:59:58,857
Ugh.

2401
01:59:58,942 --> 02:00:01,276
Hey, I'm sorry. God...
What's this?

2402
02:00:01,945 --> 02:00:04,905
This your date drug?
Your roofie?

2403
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:06,740
It's a Mentos.

2404
02:00:07,492 --> 02:00:09,410
They're "The Freshmaker. "

2405
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:10,869
Yeah, right.

2406
02:00:11,121 --> 02:00:13,080
What are you,
some kind of sex pervert?

2407
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:14,498
Are you a deviant
or something?

2408
02:00:14,582 --> 02:00:17,292
No, I'm not a sexual deviant!
What is all this?

2409
02:00:17,377 --> 02:00:19,795
I haven't even tried
to have sex with you, so...

2410
02:00:19,879 --> 02:00:22,798
What are you trying to do? What
are you buttering me up for?

2411
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:23,966
Come on.

2412
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:25,801
You're not gonna try
and kill me, are you?

2413
02:00:25,885 --> 02:00:28,554
Look, Trish.
You didn't get a new carpet.

2414
02:00:28,847 --> 02:00:32,141
I'm not trying to kill you.
I love you.

2415
02:00:32,559 --> 02:00:34,977
I love you.
Oh, God!

2416
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:36,395
Trish.

2417
02:00:44,988 --> 02:00:47,197
Trish. No!

2418
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:50,617
No. Trish, stop.

2419
02:00:55,123 --> 02:00:56,415
Come on, Trish!

2420
02:00:59,878 --> 02:01:01,795
I need to talk to you!

2421
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:02,921
No!

2422
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:06,133
Damn it.

2423
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:39,291
Oh, my God!

2424
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:45,172
Andy! Oh, my God!

2425
02:01:45,256 --> 02:01:46,632
Call 911.

2426
02:01:46,799 --> 02:01:48,717
Oh, my... Andy.

2427
02:01:49,511 --> 02:01:51,220
Oh, my God!

2428
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:54,097
I'm gonna need a minute. I'm
in a lot of pain right now.

2429
02:01:54,182 --> 02:01:55,849
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

2430
02:01:55,934 --> 02:01:57,059
Not bad.

2431
02:01:57,143 --> 02:01:59,520
There were two sides
to that billboard.

2432
02:01:59,604 --> 02:02:01,480
And they both hurt equally.

2433
02:02:01,773 --> 02:02:04,399
Andy. Andy.

2434
02:02:06,486 --> 02:02:08,654
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

2435
02:02:09,155 --> 02:02:10,822
No, I'm not okay.

2436
02:02:12,116 --> 02:02:13,492
I'm a virgin.

2437
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:16,828
A what?

2438
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:20,165
I'm a virgin.
I always have been.

2439
02:02:21,543 --> 02:02:24,878
Andy, is that what
all this was about?

2440
02:02:25,838 --> 02:02:27,172
I'm sorry.

2441
02:02:27,257 --> 02:02:29,633
You're just a virgin,
that's all?

2442
02:02:29,759 --> 02:02:32,427
Yeah. That's good. That's a good thing.

2443
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:36,056
I feel stupid.

2444
02:02:37,725 --> 02:02:40,435
It's okay. I thought
you were trying to kill me.

2445
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:43,188
No.

2446
02:02:44,065 --> 02:02:45,357
Oh, my God.

2447
02:02:46,442 --> 02:02:49,027
No, I'm not trying
to kill you.

2448
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:55,534
That's why I never tried
to have sex with you.

2449
02:02:55,952 --> 02:02:58,412
I was scared, okay?
I just...

2450
02:02:59,122 --> 02:03:00,956
'Cause I didn't know
what I was doing.

2451
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,874
I just didn't think
it would be good.

2452
02:03:02,959 --> 02:03:05,919
Of course it'll be good.
We love each other.

2453
02:03:07,547 --> 02:03:08,714
Really?

2454
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:11,717
I love you.

2455
02:03:13,219 --> 02:03:14,386
Yeah.

2456
02:03:19,058 --> 02:03:21,602
Get the fuck out of the road,
virgin!

2457
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:24,896
Shut up, you fucking jerk!

2458
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:27,899
No, that's okay.
That's all right. Sorry.

2459
02:03:29,527 --> 02:03:30,611
You know what...

2460
02:03:30,695 --> 02:03:33,488
for so long I thought that there
was something wrong with me...

2461
02:03:33,573 --> 02:03:36,408
because it had
never happened, but...

2462
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:42,664
I realize now that it was just
because I was waiting for you.

2463
02:04:07,690 --> 02:04:10,442
This was some wedding.
How could they afford it?

2464
02:04:10,526 --> 02:04:13,820
Dude sells his toys and makes
like a half a million dollars.

2465
02:04:13,946 --> 02:04:16,114
It's crazy, right?
That's fucking crazy.

2466
02:04:16,199 --> 02:04:18,158
We're gonna get
some fucking toys.

2467
02:04:18,242 --> 02:04:20,452
We are all so happy for you.

2468
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:23,413
I am delighted
to say these words.

2469
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:25,457
Andy...

2470
02:04:26,042 --> 02:04:27,918
you may kiss the bride.

2471
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:44,309
And for God's sake,
consummate the thing.

2472
02:04:49,273 --> 02:04:52,150
No! Stop it.
I have the key.

2473
02:04:59,033 --> 02:05:01,326
I'm not gonna be done
buffing the marble...

2474
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:03,078
for about a half an hour,
but...

2475
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:05,706
you can come in and sit down
if you want...

2476
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:08,041
or wait in the lobby.
It's okay.

2477
02:05:08,126 --> 02:05:09,626
It's up to you.

2478
02:05:16,801 --> 02:05:19,136
Dude,
get the fuck out of here.

2479
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:31,648
Ready?
Yeah.

2480
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:39,156
Yes.
Yeah.

2481
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:46,830
Whoa.

2482
02:05:47,373 --> 02:05:49,666
You're officially
not a virgin.

2483
02:05:50,501 --> 02:05:51,585
Cool.

2484
02:05:59,677 --> 02:06:01,011
Wow.

2485
02:06:08,478 --> 02:06:10,103
Wanna do it again?

2486
02:06:11,189 --> 02:06:12,731
Yeah.
Good. Okay.

2487
02:06:12,815 --> 02:06:14,024
Sure.

2488
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:16,860
That was good. That was okay.

2489
02:06:20,198 --> 02:06:21,281
Okay.

2490
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:22,449
You ready?
Yeah.

2491
02:06:22,533 --> 02:06:25,160
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm fine, yeah.

2492
02:06:37,924 --> 02:06:39,925
So, how was that for you?

2493
02:06:44,805 --> 02:06:47,307
When the moon

2494
02:06:47,391 --> 02:06:50,644
Is in the Seventh House

2495
02:06:50,895 --> 02:06:55,398
And Jupiter aligns with Mars

2496
02:06:56,400 --> 02:07:01,363
Then peace will guide
the planets

2497
02:07:01,739 --> 02:07:04,991
And love
will steer the stars

2498
02:07:05,076 --> 02:07:09,538
This is the dawning
of the age of Aquarius

2499
02:07:09,747 --> 02:07:14,042
Age of Aquarius

2500
02:07:14,627 --> 02:07:24,219
Aquarius

2501
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:26,972
Harm ony and understanding

2502
02:07:27,306 --> 02:07:29,849
Sym pathy and trust
abounding

2503
02:07:29,934 --> 02:07:31,810
No more falsehoods
or derisions

2504
02:07:31,894 --> 02:07:34,854
Golden living dream s
of visions

2505
02:07:34,939 --> 02:07:37,190
Mystic crystal revelations

2506
02:07:37,275 --> 02:07:40,277
And the mind's true
liberation

2507
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:49,953
Aquarius

2508
02:07:50,371 --> 02:07:54,624
When the moon is
in the Seventh House

2509
02:07:55,418 --> 02:07:59,713
And Jupiter
aligns with Mars

2510
02:08:00,965 --> 02:08:05,760
Then peace will guide
the planets

2511
02:08:06,012 --> 02:08:09,264
And love
will steer the star

2512
02:08:09,348 --> 02:08:13,602
This is the dawning
of the age of Aquarius

2513
02:08:13,853 --> 02:08:18,481
The age of Aquarius

2514
02:08:18,816 --> 02:08:25,989
Aquarius

2515
02:08:26,073 --> 02:08:27,949
It's Aquarius, baby

2516
02:08:28,034 --> 02:08:30,619
We ain't talking about
no Scorpio

2517
02:08:30,703 --> 02:08:32,203
We ain't talking about no

2518
02:08:32,288 --> 02:08:35,290
No, we ain't talking
about no Scorqio

2519
02:08:39,503 --> 02:08:49,346
Aquarius

2520
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:58,688
Let the sunshine

2521
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:02,442
Let the sunshine in

2522
02:09:02,526 --> 02:09:05,904
The sunshine in

2523
02:09:06,906 --> 02:09:10,241
Let the sunshine

2524
02:09:10,826 --> 02:09:14,204
Let the sunshine in

2525
02:09:14,288 --> 02:09:17,832
The sunshine in

2526
02:09:18,709 --> 02:09:22,379
Let the sunshine

2527
02:09:22,463 --> 02:09:25,965
Let the sunshine in

2528
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:30,178
The sunshine in
Let it shine, let it shine

2529
02:09:30,429 --> 02:09:33,765
Let the sunshine

2530
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:35,684
Let it shine

2531
02:09:35,768 --> 02:09:37,769
Let it shine, yeah

2532
02:09:37,853 --> 02:09:41,690
The sunshine in

2533
02:09:42,149 --> 02:09:45,610
Let the sunshine

2534
02:09:45,986 --> 02:09:49,406
Let the sunshine in

2535
02:09:49,490 --> 02:09:52,450
The sunshine in
