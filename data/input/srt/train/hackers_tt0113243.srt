1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
                                    
                                   

2
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:06,773
- Upstairs!
- What's going on?

3
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:07,940
Who are you?

4
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,071
Dade! Dade!

5
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,114
Knock it down.

6
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:18,410
The defendant, Dade Murphy,

7
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:22,374
who calls himself 'Zero Cool',

8
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:27,379
has repeatedly committed criminal acts
of a malicious nature.

9
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,926
This defendant possesses
a superior intelligence,

10
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:36,514
which he uses to a destructive
and antisocial end.

11
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:46,066
His computer virus crashed 1507 systems,
including Wall Street trading systems,

12
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:51,279
single-handedly causing a seven-point
drop in the New York stock market.

13
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:56,744
Dade Murphy, I hereby fine
your family $45,000.

14
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:02,125
I sentence you to probation.
You are forbidden to use a computer

15
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,422
or a touchtone telephone until
the day of your 18th birthday.

16
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,590
- Dade?
- Yeah, Mom?

17
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:42,342
What are you doing?

18
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:46,929
Taking over a TV network.

19
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:51,643
Finish up, honey. Go to sleep.
And happy birthday.

20
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,486
Security, Norm...

21
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:01,570
Norman speaking.

22
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:04,866
Norman. This is Mr Eddie Vedder
from Accounting.

23
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:08,995
I had a power surge here at home
that wiped out a file I was working on.

24
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:12,875
I'm in big trouble.
You know anything about computers?

25
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:15,586
Gee...

26
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:20,383
My BLT drive on my computer
just went AWOL,

27
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:24,846
and I have this big project
due tomorrow for Mr Kawasaki.

28
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,182
If I screw up, he'll make me
commit hari-kari.

29
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:32,396
You know these Japanese
management techniques.

30
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:35,900
Could you read me
the number on the modem?

31
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,321
It's a little boxy thing
with switches on it.

32
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:42,407
It lets my computer
talk to the one there.

33
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:43,408
212...

34
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:48,080
5554240.

35
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:16,444
So-called American Indians, Latinos,
and blacks are genetically mediocre.

36
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,362
Yak, yak, yak.

37
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:20,532
Get a job.

38
00:06:53,943 --> 00:06:57,072
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery

39
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:58,698
which reaches from
the inner mind

40
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:02,160
to... The Outer Limits.

41
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:14,883
Zero...

42
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:17,219
No, wait.

43
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,525
Unbelievable.

44
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,235
A hacker.

45
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:42,287
Yeah, okay, Acid Burn. That's enough.

46
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:30,590
Shit on me!

47
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:39,558
Good morning.
Did you unpack your stuff yet?

48
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:43,438
Up all night again?

49
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:46,649
Can this wait until both
of my eyes are open?

50
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:53,531
Can I cut the electricity to his room
so he'll get some sleep?

51
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:57,328
He's been playing with his computer
all night for a week.

52
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,122
Yes, he could be playing with himself.

53
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,168
Yes, I'll ask. Dade,

54
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,713
you like girls, don't you?

55
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,883
Yeah. I just haven't found one
as charming as you.

56
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,720
You haven't done anything stupid, right?

57
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,349
Right, Dade?

58
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:17,642
Right, Mom.

59
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,686
And I'm still a virgin.

60
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,914
You hooked it up to the phone,
didn't you?

61
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:41,376
Dade, turn the shower off!

62
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:46,965
You screw up again
and you won't get into college.

63
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:02,274
I'm sorry we had to move
in your senior year.

64
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,194
I didn't want to sell the house
but I had to take this job. You know that.

65
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:10,282
You'II love New York.
It's the city that never sleeps.

66
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,660
I miss you, too, baby.
Claro que sí.

67
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,372
Excuse me.

68
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:56,792
Chill, man. I'm talking to Venezuela.

69
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:59,294
I'm sorry. Where's the principal's office?

70
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:00,837
I can't help you, kid.

71
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:16,813
Do you have your transfer forms?

72
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,860
It's a straightforward question.

73
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:29,202
Do you speak English?

74
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:31,788
Sorry, you wanted...

75
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:33,415
Transfer forms.

76
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,468
Are you coming?

77
00:11:56,898 --> 00:12:00,819
The gym is through there
and the cafeteria is through there.

78
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,406
Great. Cool.

79
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,411
What's your name?

80
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,830
Kate. Kate Libby.

81
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:13,083
Here's your class.

82
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,170
My class.
I'm not in your class?

83
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:18,839
No, you're not in my class.

84
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,678
Give me time.

85
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:25,346
- You new?
- Yeah.

86
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:27,682
Tell him about the pool, Kate.

87
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:29,851
Pool?

88
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:33,605
There's an Olympic-size
swimming pool on the roof.

89
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:36,192
Take the stairs over there.

90
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,612
Yeah. Sure.

91
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:43,032
Thanks.

92
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:49,081
Hey! Hold the door!

93
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:55,337
No pool.

94
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:31,836
Oh, my God. He found the pool.

95
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,717
I'm Mr Simpson.

96
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:41,888
I'm subbing for Ms Bayless,
who was arrested at the anti-fur rally.

97
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:50,397
I know some ofyou kids got computers
at home, but these are schooI property.

98
00:13:56,571 --> 00:14:00,408
Chapter One.
'Designing GraphicaI Interface'.

99
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,293
What's your interest in Kate Libby?

100
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:11,336
Academic, purely sexual?

101
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:13,172
Homicidal.

102
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,760
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak.

103
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,472
The Fantom Phreak?
The King of Nynex?

104
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,476
I know you play the game.

105
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:27,271
Phreak, Phreak, Phreak.
Dude, dude, dude.

106
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,067
Joey! One more 'dude'
and I'll slap the shit out of you.

107
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:35,863
You gotta stop letting your mama
dress you, man. You're hopeless!

108
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:39,910
- Check it.
- I need a handle.

109
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,997
I don't have an identity
until I have a handle.

110
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:47,377
You're right about that.
Check it. Friday.

111
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:54,467
Wait. How about The Master of Disaster?

112
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,803
You're utterly hopeless, man.

113
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:59,348
Ultra Laser... Doctor Doom!

114
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,827
Tell me what you need. Records?
Tapes? Any kind offormat or disk.

115
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:22,581
Check this out, each of you.
Compilation tapes of my own making.

116
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:24,709
I call this 'The Greatest Zukes Album',

117
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:30,256
featuring Hendrix, Joplin,
Mama Cass, Belushi,

118
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:34,636
all great artists who asphyxiated
on their own vomit!

119
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:37,347
You can't get this in stores!

120
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:51,028
Please deposit $5
for the first minute.

121
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:54,241
Thank you.

122
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,784
No, thank you.

123
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:28,737
That's a nice score for a girl.

124
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:33,158
Think you can do better?

125
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,328
I'll give it a shot.

126
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,305
Is this kid bothering you, Kate?

127
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,183
Could I get some room here?

128
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,811
Why don't you come up here?

129
00:17:37,353 --> 00:17:38,438
He's good!

130
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:51,618
Well, it looks like I'm on top.

131
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:59,085
Congratulations.
No-one's ever beat her before.

132
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:01,212
You just made an enemy for life.

133
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,177
Boy meets world. Let's go.

134
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:27,407
- Who's that?
- Curtis.

135
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:30,119
What's he do?

136
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:33,122
You're looking at it.
He looks slick all day.

137
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:36,709
Joey!

138
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,088
What's up?

139
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:27,390
Oh, my God! You...?

140
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,904
Way cool!

141
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:43,991
You saw that?

142
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:45,785
What the hell is going on?

143
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:48,121
Pool on the roof must be leaking.

144
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:00,259
Oh, man. This is going to be good.

145

147
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:15,400
Ruth Libby.

148
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:20,865
I'm not sure your mother qualifies
as a significant 20th century author.

149
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,659
Her last book sold 2 million copies.

the ancient heavenly connection

Ginsberg.

00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:41,513
Nice. Very nice.

154
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:45,433
He's not in this class.

155
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:47,102
I said give me time.

156
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:51,272
He's not enrolled in this class.

157
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:53,526
Well, he's on my list.

You. What is your name?

161
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,094
Emmanuel Goldstein, sir.

162
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,014
You, however, are not on my list.

163
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:25,561
This isn't wood shop class?

164
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:33,152
Class crashing. Come on.

165
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:34,695
Now get out.

166
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,199
Thank you, sir.

167
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,499
How was school?

168
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,006
- What did we learn in school today?
- Revenge.

169
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:54,800
Ahh. Did we meet someone special?

170
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:56,802
No. No-one special.

171
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:02,768
I have to get back to work.
Would you please try to fill these out?

172
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,770
Don't worry,

173
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:06,855
it's only the rest of your life.

174
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:12,111
Anything else?
Want me to mow the lawn?

175
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:14,781
Oops, I forgot. New York, no grass.

176
00:22:15,656 --> 00:22:16,866
And unpack.

177
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:44,522
You can sit at home
and do absolutely nothing

178
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:47,733
and your name goes through
17 computers a day.

179
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:51,112
'1984'? Yeah, right. That's a typo.

180
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:56,410
Orwell's here and living large.
We have no names, man. No names!

181
00:22:57,494 --> 00:22:58,703
Can I score a fry?

182
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:01,623
Meet Cereal Killer.

183
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,250
As in Fruit Loops.

184
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,211
But he does know things.

185
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:07,213
Anyway, guys, listen.

186
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:10,091
I'm in this computer, right?
I'm looking around...

187
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:12,218
You got those Crayola books?

188
00:23:12,343 --> 00:23:14,220
Yeah, technicolour rainbow.

189
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:16,640
Green one.

190
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:18,851
What is that? Let me see?

191
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:22,229
- What are these?
- International UNIX environments.

192
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:24,022
Luscious orange.

193
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:27,652
Computer security criteria...
DOD standards.

194
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,614
The pink-shirt book... guide to IBM PCs.

195
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:35,076
So-called due to the nasty pink shirt
the guy wears on the cover.

196
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,995
Devil book, the UNIX bible.

197
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,707
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.

198
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,544
- What's that?
- The Red book.

199
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:46,046
NSA-trusted networks.

200
00:23:46,213 --> 00:23:50,218
Otherwise known as 'The Ugly Red Book
That Won't Fit On A Shelf'.

201
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:54,681
Anyway, guys. Come on.
I'm in this computer, right.

202
00:23:55,307 --> 00:24:00,229
I'm looking around, throwing commands.
I don't know what it does or anything.

203
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:01,522
It's choice.

204
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:05,568
It's beautiful. Four hours
just messing around in there.

205
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:08,571
Finally, I figure out...

206
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,365
that it's a bank.

207
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,995
Okay, wait. It's a bank. So, this morning,
I check the paper,

208
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,709
some cash machine in, like, Bumsville,
Idaho, spits out $700 into the street.

209
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,545
- That's kinda cool.
- That was me.

210
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,673
- I did that.
- You did this from your house?

211
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,802
Are you stoned or stupid?

212
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:32,932
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the FBl.

213
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,433
Are your brains in your ass?

214
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,060
Don't you know anything?

215
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,813
It's universally stupid, man.

216
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:42,441
I don't know things because you guys
won't tell me anything. Right?

217
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,486
What are the three most used passwords?

218
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:48,323
'Love', 'Secret' and 'Sex'.

219
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:51,201
But not in that order, necessarily. Right?

220
00:24:51,326 --> 00:24:56,249
Don't forget 'God'. System operators
love to use 'God'. Male ego.

221
00:24:56,541 --> 00:25:01,421
To be elite, you have to do a righteous
hack, not this accidental shit.

222
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:06,301
Which means you score
one of those Gibsons, man.

223
00:25:06,427 --> 00:25:10,514
Those supercomputers they use
to do physics and look for oil.

224
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,183
No way, man. Security is too tight.

225
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:16,270
Maybe. But if I wanted to hack
some heavy metal,

226
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:19,983
I'd work my way in
through some back door.

227
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:25,447
Oh, man. Wouldn't you just love
to get one of those Gibsons?

228
00:25:26,364 --> 00:25:28,200
Who ate all of my fries?

229
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:32,663
- Joey!
- No, I didn't touch your fries.

230
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:36,417
- Cereal, man. You owe me a pack.
- It was him.

231
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,254
- Lay off that shit, man.
- I'm gonna hit you!

232
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:43,907
Yes! Home run, home run. Okay, okay.

233
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:47,245
You and me, Lucy.

234
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:49,831
We're gonna show them, baby.

235
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:51,249
Ow!

236
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,534
Mr Belford?

237
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:27,079
My name is The Plague.

238
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:30,709
Mr The Plague, something weird
is happening on the net.

239
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,503
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

240
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:37,007
One of the Gibsons is working really hard.

241
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,678
We got one person on-line
but with the workload of 10 users.

242
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:42,180
I think we got a hacker.

243
00:27:47,226 --> 00:27:50,188
Okay, we need proof that we were here.

244
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,944
Yeah. Garbage. Give me Garbage.

245
00:28:07,582 --> 00:28:09,250
Shit.

246
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,365
Never fear,

247
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:39,909
I is here.

248
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:46,124
- I located the activity to terminal 23.
- Let's echo 23, see what's up.

249
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,644
God wouldn't be up this late.

250
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:19,536
Shit!

251
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:24,082
Get me the switching control centre.
I need to trace this call.

252
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:33,634
Hold on, Mom. Hold on one second.

253
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:37,680
- Open the door, Joseph.
- Yeah, okay.

254
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:40,641
There you go.

255
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,061
Bed. Sleep.

256
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,731
Now!

257
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:48,984
Sweet dreams, Joseph.

258
00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:54,032
He's gone.

259
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:55,658
Did you get a trace?

260
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,285
Yeah, we got him.

261
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,828
Good.

262
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:14,971
Nice place, huh?

263
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:21,478
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?

264
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:25,190
- You know who he is?
- No. Don't know who he is.

265
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:26,317
Do you?

266
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:31,572
Nikon! Lord Nikon, this is...

267
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,074
Crash Override.

268
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:35,576
Never heard of you.
You done anything?

269
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:36,452
No.

270
00:30:38,622 --> 00:30:39,957
Come on!

271
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:45,462
What? Your Mom buy you
a 'puter for Christmas?

272
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:50,593
- Does he know anything?
- Sure. He's elite.

273
00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:53,221
Come in.

274
00:30:59,103 --> 00:31:02,940
- Nikon, can I crash at your place tonight?
- Again?

275
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:05,526
Yeah, sure.

276
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:12,409
Hackers penetrate and ravage

277
00:31:12,534 --> 00:31:16,121
public and private computer systems,
infecting them with viruses...

278
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:17,873
Who are these guys?

279
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:22,753
Richard Gill.
Hacker enemy number one. Real boner.

280
00:31:23,754 --> 00:31:26,090
Showtime. Showtime!

281
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:32,013
- What's going on?
- Four,

282
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:35,309
three, two, one...

283
00:31:37,394 --> 00:31:38,812
Welcome to our show!

284
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:39,897
Hack the Planet!

285
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:42,232
Hack the Planet!

286
00:31:43,025 --> 00:31:46,446
For late night hacks, Jolt Cola,
soft drink ofthe elite hacker.

287
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,948
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.

288
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,950
Razor and Blade?

289
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,536
That's right. This is a pay-phone.

290
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,414
Don't ask.

291
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:59,251
As you can see, this isjust a simple
micro-cassette recorder.

292
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:03,005
Hook it up to the phone,
and drop in five bucks in quarters.

293
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,551
Record the tone the coins make,
hang up, get your money back.

294
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:10,096
Never again pay for a service
that would be cheap,

295
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:12,557
if it weren't run
by profiteering gluttons.

296
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:16,270
Remember, hacking is more than
just a crime. It's a survivaI trait.

297
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,775
I'm a real wild child,
I'm a wild one

298
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,694
I'm a wild one

299
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:29,284
Thank you! Thank you very much!

300
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:34,498
Joey! Joey! Thank you!

301
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,916
Freeze!

302
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,334
- What?
- Get out of there!

303
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:38,293
Out!

304
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:41,381
- Joey!
- Get in there!

305
00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:43,383
Sit down!

306
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:44,968
Lucy!

307
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:47,303
Where are you taking her?

308
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:49,849
Joey!

309
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:01,027
- How's it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.

310
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:02,988
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.

311
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:05,073
In English, please.

312
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:07,159
I didn't protect the President
for ten years

313
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:09,202
to finish my career
feeling like an idiot.

314
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:13,332
I'm sorry, sir. He didn't have time
to erase his computer files.

315
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:17,336
Good. Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.

316
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:19,672
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?

317
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:21,924
Why, of course, Jennifer.

318
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:26,013
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?

319
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:32,144
Hackers penetrate and ravage public
and private computer systems,

320
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:35,982
infecting them with viruses
and stealing sensitive materials.

321
00:33:36,107 --> 00:33:37,817
These people are terrorists.

322
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:56,588
Morning, gentlemen.

323
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:58,131
Please, be seated.

324
00:33:58,924 --> 00:34:01,927
I see we're still dressing
in the dark, Eugene.

325
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,847
Once again, don't call me Eugene.

326
00:34:06,014 --> 00:34:07,475
Our recent intruder

327
00:34:07,642 --> 00:34:12,980
penetrated using a superuser account,
giving him access to our whole system.

328
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:16,609
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

329
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:21,615
Someone didn't bother reading my memo
on commonly used passwords.

330
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:25,702
As I meticulously pointed out,
the foremost used passwords are...

331
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:30,792
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' and 'God'.

332
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:34,754
So would Your Holiness
care to change her password?

333
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:38,800
A hacker planted the virus.

334
00:34:39,551 --> 00:34:41,011
Virus?

335
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:48,811
Yesterday, the ballast program
for a supertanker training model

336
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:53,024
mistakenly thought the vessel was empty
and flooded its tanks.

337
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,818
Excuse me?

338
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,446
The little boat flipped over.

339
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:03,452
A virus planted within the Gibson system
claimed responsibility.

340
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:04,704
It left a note?

341
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,756
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in 7 days,

342
00:35:14,923 --> 00:35:17,843
I will capsize five tankers
in the Ellingson fleet.

343
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,387
- Is that...?
- That is the virus.

344
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:22,473
Leonardo da Vinci.

345
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,270
We have 26 ships at sea
and don't know which ones are infected.

346
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:31,357
Well, put the ship's ballast
under manual control.

347
00:35:31,524 --> 00:35:32,984
There's no such thing any more.

348
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:35,488
These ships are totally computerised.

349
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:38,115
They rely on satellite navigation

350
00:35:38,282 --> 00:35:43,037
which links them to our network,
and the virus, wherever they are.

351
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:45,247
What are we supposed to do?

352
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,628
Luckily, you have a gifted
and talented security officer.

353
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:53,548
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.

354
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:58,304
I'll search his files for the original
virus code and eliminate it.

355
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:01,724
We expect you
to get on this right away.

356
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:06,771
- How soon?
- As fast as I can.

357
00:36:06,938 --> 00:36:11,401
This is common in corporations
as large as ours. Don't worry about it.

358
00:36:12,528 --> 00:36:15,113
The Secret Service
is helping us out, 100 percent.

359
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:18,158
We'll be in touch.

360
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,495
What the hell was that all about?

361
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:23,957
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.

362
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,083
What?

363
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,878
I created da Vinci so we could
get the Secret Service

364
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:32,466
to arrest the hacker and seize
the equipment, which we can't do alone.

365
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:39,098
- I don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax. Think about the $25 million.

366
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:45,605
But you created a virus that's going to
cause a worldwide ecological disaster.

367
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:48,692
Just to arrest some hacker kid?

368
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:50,652
Basically, yes.

369
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:54,198
Jesus! You're sick, Eugene.

370
00:36:54,532 --> 00:36:55,700
I'll take care of this.

371
00:36:56,909 --> 00:37:01,038
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need the code.

372
00:37:01,414 --> 00:37:03,584
What better way to confiscate the disk

373
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,753
and find out how much of
the garbage file was copied.

374
00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:08,922
Get it!

375
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:13,177
Why did I ever trust you?

376
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:18,975
Get the file, otherwise
you'll lose all your toys.

377
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:30,613
Did you find the virus program
on the disks we confiscated?

378
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:35,242
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

379
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:41,917
Then he stashed it somewhere,
or he has an accomplice.

380
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:49,467
We'll release him. Keep tight surveillance
and see if he leads us to your disk.

381
00:37:55,014 --> 00:37:59,144
Unit 3, outside suspect
Joey Pardella's apartment.

382
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:02,356
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.

383
00:38:03,023 --> 00:38:04,233
Listen to this bullshit.

384
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:09,321
'This is our world now. The world
of the electron and the switch,

385
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,491
'the beauty ofthe baud.

386
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:16,412
'We exist without nationality,
skin colour or religious bias.

387
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:19,749
'You wage wars, murder,
cheat, lie to us,

388
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:23,587
'and try to make us believe it's for
our own good, yet we're the criminals.

389
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:28,217
'Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.

390
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:32,973
'I am a hacker
and this is my manifesto. '

391
00:38:34,391 --> 00:38:36,017
Right? Manifesto?

392
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:37,185
'You may stop me,

393
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:40,105
'but you can't stop us all. '

394
00:38:41,273 --> 00:38:42,399
That's cool.

395
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:44,610
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.

396
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:45,903
You think it's cool?

397
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:51,033
- It's cool.
- It's not cool. It's commie bullshit.

398
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:01,211
Can I crash at your place tonight?

399
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:03,505
What's with him?

400
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:06,801
His parents missed Woodstock
and he's been making up for it since.

401
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:08,761
You hear about Joey's bust?

402
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,433
Probably had something to do
with that bank in Idaho.

403
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,435
You think he could hack a Gibson?

404
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:20,065
- Did you talk to him?
- No. His mom says he's grounded

405
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:24,195
for his next three lifetimes. And no
'consorting with computer friends'.

406
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,697
The Secret Service is out to get him.

407
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,659
Want to go to a big party tonight?

408
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,495
It's at Kate's.

409
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:33,788
I thought so.

410
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,625
A little pelvis.

411
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,753
A little pelvis.

412
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:58,899
What the hell are you doing?

413
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:00,527
Plague!

414
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:02,070
Plague!

415
00:40:03,238 --> 00:40:04,155
Gill.

416
00:40:05,114 --> 00:40:06,699
I think we got something.

417
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:10,119
Yuk!... Hard copy!

418
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,457
Dade Murphy.

419
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:17,461
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!

420
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:18,295
What are you...?

421
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,755
Shut up!

422
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,010
What are you doing? Get off me!

423
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:27,055
God!

424
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:30,433
Sit on the bed and keep your hands
where we can see them.

425
00:40:32,394 --> 00:40:34,689
The year was 1988.

426
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:39,610
A nasty virus crashed
1,500 systems in one day.

427
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:44,240
1,507.

428
00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:46,159
It got you 7 years' probation.

429
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,746
No computer. No touchtone phones.

430
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:53,917
Must have been hell, huh, Zero Cool?

431
00:40:55,587 --> 00:41:00,091
A virus has been planted in
the Ellingson Mineral computer system.

432
00:41:00,216 --> 00:41:02,635
You were our prime suspect.

433
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,222
Till we trashed your stuff
and found no trace of it.

434
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:11,103
We believe that Joey Pardella
is involved in this Ellingson virus.

435
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:16,609
He or his accomplice has a disk that
Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.

436
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:19,821
We want you to help us find it.

437
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:20,530
Gill.

438
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:34,337
Loser.

439
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:39,760
I can't believe you were only 11
when you wrote this.

440
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:45,057
It's quite an impressive virus.

441
00:41:47,643 --> 00:41:48,644
Dade.

442
00:41:50,437 --> 00:41:55,360
I know how you might feel about narking
on your friends, but... we're hackers.

443
00:41:55,527 --> 00:42:00,156
For us, there's no such thing
as family and friends.

444
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:05,162
We're each our own country,
with temporary allies and enemies.

445
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,959
Let's make a treaty.

446
00:42:11,752 --> 00:42:14,256
I'm sorry. Who are you?

447
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:21,263
I'm the one who understands you.

448
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:24,809
Now, can we be allies?

449
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:30,773
Nah. I don't play well with others.

450
00:42:46,457 --> 00:42:49,002
Shit! Come on!

451
00:42:49,502 --> 00:42:52,338
Watch which friends you do play with.

452
00:42:52,505 --> 00:42:58,387
With your record, you could land in jail
or get expelled. No college. No future.

453
00:42:59,263 --> 00:43:03,142
Exiled from everyone
and everything you love.

454
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:08,315
I'll be in touch.

455
00:43:09,816 --> 00:43:11,985
He's fine.
Oh, and Dade,

456
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,531
- try to stay out of trouble, okay?
- Blow me.

457
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:19,118
Thank you.

458
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:29,403
Her Mom makes big bucks
writing books for women.

459
00:44:29,695 --> 00:44:33,115
Stuff like 'Women Who Love Men
Who Are Emotional Amoebae'.

460
00:44:33,824 --> 00:44:35,075
That explains a lot.

461
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:55,389
Big man, stepping in.
Coming through.

462
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:59,227
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.

463
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,319
- Yo, what's up, Nikon?
- In the house, man. Thanks.

464
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:09,321
Dade, man. You made it.

465
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,575
Houston, we have lift-off.

466
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,703
Three o'clock. Check it.
Don't look right away!

467
00:45:15,828 --> 00:45:17,371
Look at her, man.

468
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:26,298
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.

469
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,674
5554817.

470
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:28,675
Boom!

471
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,305
- How'd you know that?
- I got a photographic memory.

472
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,265
It's a curse.

473
00:45:34,474 --> 00:45:35,725
Lisa!

474
00:45:41,564 --> 00:45:46,862
Oh! Look at that pooper, man.
Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right.

475
00:45:53,494 --> 00:45:56,206
Hi, my name's Vicki and I'm an addict.

476
00:45:57,707 --> 00:46:00,252
Hi. My name's Hank and I'm an addict.

477
00:46:02,712 --> 00:46:04,089
My name's Joey, but...

478
00:46:05,258 --> 00:46:06,342
I'm not an addict.

479
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:08,761
No, really. Listen.

480
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,638
I got in trouble with my computer.

481
00:46:10,763 --> 00:46:14,809
My lawyer told the judge I'm an addict,
but I'm not addicted to my computer.

482
00:46:15,268 --> 00:46:16,186
No, really.

483
00:46:16,937 --> 00:46:18,021
I'm not an addict.

484
00:46:18,397 --> 00:46:19,314
I'm not.

485
00:46:20,983 --> 00:46:22,317
Can I get some more coffee?

486
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:36,708
Yo! Check this out.
This is insanely great.

487
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,961
It's got a 28.8 bps modem.

488
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:42,047
- Yeah? Display?
- Active matrix.

489
00:46:42,172 --> 00:46:44,300
A million psychedelic colours.

490
00:46:44,425 --> 00:46:46,010
This baby is sweet.

491
00:46:46,927 --> 00:46:49,723
- I want it.
- I want it to have my children.

492
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,892
- Bet it looks crispy in the dark.
- Hit the light.

493
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,246
Shit!

494
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:14,583
Come on. Get out.

495
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,127
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.

496
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:18,879
Difficulty rating?

497
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:21,048
Seven.

498
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:28,139
Wow!... Burn's wetware
matches her software.

499
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:31,184
Burn?

500
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:34,271
What are you doing here?

501
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:37,233
We're sorry! Just looking
at your fly laptop.

502
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:38,817
It's hype, you know.

503
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:40,402
You're in the butter zone now, baby.

504
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:44,908
Yeah, it is.

505
00:47:46,493 --> 00:47:47,994
I want to triple the RAM.

506
00:47:49,204 --> 00:47:52,874
Leopard boy and the deceptor cons.

507
00:47:54,084 --> 00:47:57,922
Kate! You're not going into that
computer shit now, right?

508
00:47:59,882 --> 00:48:01,133
Later, babe.

509
00:48:02,718 --> 00:48:05,638
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.

510
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:09,268
What's he doing here?

511
00:48:09,393 --> 00:48:11,019
He's my guest, Burn.

512
00:48:11,478 --> 00:48:12,563
You're Acid Burn?!

513
00:48:12,729 --> 00:48:14,606
You booted me out of OTV.

514
00:48:15,482 --> 00:48:18,111
- What?
- I'm Crash Override.

515
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:21,698
You're the moron
who's been invading my turf?

516
00:48:23,366 --> 00:48:24,617
Whoa, whoa! Crash...

517
00:48:24,742 --> 00:48:25,743
and Burn!

518
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:40,802
Murphy kid turn you down?

519
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:47,350
I disguised myself as an Alabama State
Trooper and penetrated the FBl NCIC.

520
00:48:47,517 --> 00:48:48,768
Pervert.

521
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:51,480
What are you talking about?

522
00:48:53,941 --> 00:48:57,737
The FBl computer holds files
on 20 million Americans.

523
00:48:58,529 --> 00:49:00,406
I just hacked into it.

524
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:02,451
Congratulations.

525
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,122
I have access to every piece of data
stored on Dade Murphy's parents.

526
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:13,630
His parents separated five years ago,
reconciled, then divorced last year.

527
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:14,881
Custody battle.

528
00:49:15,048 --> 00:49:17,217
Boy chose to go with his mother.

529
00:49:17,634 --> 00:49:18,593
So?

530
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:25,184
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

531
00:50:12,151 --> 00:50:13,778
What the hell are you doing?

532
00:50:14,696 --> 00:50:16,531
It's cool, I'm just looking.

533
00:50:18,074 --> 00:50:20,744
- It's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?

534
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:34,217
I hope you don't screw like you type.

535
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:42,894
It has a killer refresh rate.

536
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,982
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

537
00:50:48,107 --> 00:50:51,402
It's not just the chip. It has a PCl bus.

538
00:50:51,527 --> 00:50:53,655
But... you knew that.

539
00:50:54,281 --> 00:50:55,949
Indeed.

540
00:50:56,366 --> 00:50:58,577
RISC architecture is going
to change everything.

541
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:01,163
Yeah. RISC is good.

542
00:51:06,169 --> 00:51:09,339
Sure this sweet machine's
not going to waste?

543
00:51:11,674 --> 00:51:14,094
Crash Override. What was it?

544
00:51:14,386 --> 00:51:18,557
'Mess with the best, die like the rest'?

545
00:51:19,225 --> 00:51:20,226
Yeah.

546
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,358
Are you challenging me?

547
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:27,567
Name your stakes.

548
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:31,947
If I win, you become my slave.

549
00:51:34,032 --> 00:51:35,033
Your slave?

550
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:36,786
You wish.

551
00:51:37,745 --> 00:51:40,748
You'll do shit work.
Scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.

552
00:51:40,873 --> 00:51:42,792
Deal. And if I win?

553
00:51:42,917 --> 00:51:45,253
Make it my first born.

554
00:51:45,378 --> 00:51:47,798
- Make it our first date.
- You won't win.

555
00:51:49,007 --> 00:51:50,217
And you have to smile.

556
00:51:50,342 --> 00:51:53,011
I don't do dates.

557
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:56,974
But I don't lose, either. So you're on.

558
00:52:03,356 --> 00:52:06,192
Here's the deaI, the chosen contest:

559
00:52:06,317 --> 00:52:10,114
To hassle Secret Service Agent
Richard Gill and get one back for Joey.

560
00:52:15,661 --> 00:52:19,873
Our decisions are finaI
by a vote oftwo to one. No appeals.

561
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:26,089
The dueI will last
untiI we declare a winner.

562
00:52:29,634 --> 00:52:34,390
Use only the access codes
and passwords in your collection.

563
00:52:34,515 --> 00:52:35,933
No help from us.

564
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,649
Talkin' to me?

565
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:46,111
Any questions?

566
00:52:46,236 --> 00:52:49,948
Yeah. Who's going to notify
his next of kin?

567
00:53:43,215 --> 00:53:45,384
He's in the personal ads.

568
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:53,017
'Disappointed white male, cross-dresser,
looking for discreet friend

569
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:55,478
'to bring dreams to reality.

570
00:53:55,603 --> 00:54:01,235
'Leather, lace and water sports.
Transvestites welcome. '

571
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,572
I know where you can stick it.

572
00:54:05,364 --> 00:54:08,409
Ijust want to lick
your earlobes and your lips.

573
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:11,288
You want to lick something? Lick this!

574
00:54:12,455 --> 00:54:14,249
That's why they call me Stallion.

575
00:54:14,374 --> 00:54:15,792
That's disgusting!

576
00:54:16,126 --> 00:54:17,836
My heart is steaming for you...

577
00:54:18,169 --> 00:54:21,423
- .. spank you with...
- I'll spank your ass!

578
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,884
- .. turn you over and...
- Agghh!

579
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,136
Animal!

580
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:13,021
Hey!... Hey! Do you know who I am?

581
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:15,023
Do you know who I am?

582
00:55:38,173 --> 00:55:42,512
This is Accounting, sir. You inquired
about Agent Richard Gill?

583
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:43,513
Yes.

584
00:55:43,638 --> 00:55:47,475
- Our records indicate he's deceased.
- I'm what?

585
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,935
- Dead.
- Dead?

586
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:52,231
Yeah. Like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.

587
00:55:52,356 --> 00:55:55,609
- Very impressive.
- Superhero-like, even.

588
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:57,778
Yeah, whatever.

589
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:00,114
What's the score?

590
00:56:03,243 --> 00:56:04,244
Tie.

591
00:56:06,371 --> 00:56:08,915
Come on. Due to Mr Gill's
untimely demise,

592
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,336
- you'll have to improvise the next round.
- Right.

593
00:56:13,379 --> 00:56:14,797
I win,

594
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:17,717
you wear a dress on our date.

595
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:19,844
And if I win,

596
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:21,846
so do you.

597
00:56:26,852 --> 00:56:27,769
Deal.

598
00:57:06,144 --> 00:57:07,020
Dade.

599
00:57:08,481 --> 00:57:11,359
I didn't know your size,
so... I guessed.

600
00:57:13,444 --> 00:57:15,071
You will stick with the deal?

601
00:57:26,124 --> 00:57:27,125
Thanks.

602
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:45,145
You wanted to know who I am, Zero CooI?
Let me explain...

603
00:57:45,271 --> 00:57:47,273
the new world order.

604
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:50,734
Governments and corporations
need people like you...

605
00:57:50,859 --> 00:57:52,529
and me.

606
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:57,242
We are the samurai,
the keyboard cowboys.

607
00:57:57,325 --> 00:57:59,244
And those otherpeople out there,

608
00:57:59,411 --> 00:58:03,499
who have no idea what's going on,
are the cattle.

609
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,793
Moo.

610
00:58:05,918 --> 00:58:10,006
I need your help. You need my help.

611
00:58:10,131 --> 00:58:13,134
Let me help you earn your spurs.

612
00:58:14,511 --> 00:58:15,554
Think about it.

613
00:58:17,014 --> 00:58:20,100
Enjoy the laptop... CooI.

614
00:58:21,351 --> 00:58:23,395
Tell me where the disk is.

615
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:32,447
You look pitiful.

616
00:58:34,282 --> 00:58:38,829
Okay, you're not grounded any more.

617
00:59:05,191 --> 00:59:08,110
- Yo, what's up?
- I gotta talk to you, man. Listen.

618
00:59:08,235 --> 00:59:11,990
- I copied a garbage file.
- So? A garbage file has shit in it.

619
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:14,284
It's hot or something.

620
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:19,122
Joey, a garbage file holds odd data.
Stuff that's been erased.

621
00:59:19,247 --> 00:59:21,250
I copied it from Ellingson, okay?

622
00:59:21,376 --> 00:59:24,212
They're asking me about it.
Will you take a look for me?

623
00:59:27,423 --> 00:59:28,925
Shit, Joey. You got a tail.

624
00:59:30,385 --> 00:59:31,387
Shit!

625
01:00:16,728 --> 01:00:19,606
I am watching you.

626
01:00:22,817 --> 01:00:24,027
Wake up.

627
01:00:25,903 --> 01:00:26,989
Ramon?

628
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:30,576
Wake up. Ramon, it's time for school.

629
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,661
Come on.

630
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:37,417
Stick your hands up! Don't move!

631
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:38,710
Déjà vu!

632
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:42,547
You're under arrest under the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

633
01:00:43,214 --> 01:00:44,382
¡La computadora de mierda!

634
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,384
¡Que te dije de no estar
jugando con esa

635
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,888
- computadora!
- What are you waiting for? Arrest me!

636
01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:02,527
You get one call.

637
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,155
Uno.

638
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:07,574
Understand?

639
01:01:22,675 --> 01:01:24,593
Operator Services?

640
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:26,762
- I'm having trouble with a number.
- What number, please?

641
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:28,847
5554202.

642
01:01:28,973 --> 01:01:30,557
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.

643
01:01:32,142 --> 01:01:34,312
- Hello?
- It's me. I'm freaking.

644
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:38,733
Joey really hacked into Ellingson.
He gave me the disk he copied

645
01:01:38,858 --> 01:01:41,695
and now I'm injaiI
for some serious shit!

646
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,491
Stuff I didn't even do, like inserting
a virus called 'da Vinci'?

647
01:01:45,616 --> 01:01:47,618
And they keep asking about you guys.

648
01:01:47,743 --> 01:01:49,328
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.

649
01:01:49,453 --> 01:01:52,498
You better figure out what's on that disk
'cause we're being framed.

650
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:54,751
It's in the place where
I put that thing once.

651
01:02:30,749 --> 01:02:31,333
Hi.

652
01:02:33,585 --> 01:02:34,919
Now I see what all the fuss is about.

653
01:02:41,969 --> 01:02:43,512
You have company.

654
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,268
- Nice room.
- We need your help.

655
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,482
Do my ears deceive me?

656
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:59,279
No, no. Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.

657
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:01,658
A wake-up call for
the Nintendo generation.

658
01:03:01,783 --> 01:03:03,493
We demand free access to data.

659
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:06,287
Well, it comes with some responsibility.

660
01:03:06,537 --> 01:03:10,750
'When I was a child, I spake as a child,
I thought as a child.

661
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,921
'But when I became a man,
I put away childish things'.

662
01:03:14,463 --> 01:03:17,591
What? It's Corinthians One,

663
01:03:17,716 --> 01:03:21,428
Chapter 13, verse 11, you know?
Come on.

664
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:28,228
Phreak and Joey are being framed.

665
01:03:28,353 --> 01:03:30,730
Can you help us find out
what's on this disk?

666
01:03:30,939 --> 01:03:31,982
I can't.

667
01:03:32,482 --> 01:03:35,736
Everybody who touches that disk
gets arrested. I can't risk arrest.

668
01:03:35,861 --> 01:03:37,071
I'm sorry.

669
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:43,619
Maybe I should go to the bathroom.

670
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,921
What is it with you?

671
01:03:53,922 --> 01:03:58,469
We're supposed to be on the same side
and we really need your help.

672
01:04:00,096 --> 01:04:01,931
I really need your help.

673
01:04:04,225 --> 01:04:06,644
I'm sorry. I can't.

674
01:04:11,108 --> 01:04:12,651
Could you copy the disk?

675
01:04:12,776 --> 01:04:16,739
And just hide it in case we get busted
so we have a copy for our lawyers.

676
01:04:16,864 --> 01:04:18,825
Something that hasn't been
tampered with.

677
01:04:23,455 --> 01:04:25,498
You guys help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

678
01:04:25,624 --> 01:04:27,125
Cereal has.

679
01:04:33,341 --> 01:04:35,760
Okay. I'll copy it.

680
01:04:35,968 --> 01:04:36,927
Thank you.

681
01:04:44,227 --> 01:04:46,104
The girl. The girl has the disk I need.

682
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:49,858
I told you.
I don't play well with others.

683
01:04:50,651 --> 01:04:52,570
Turn on your laptop.

684
01:04:53,404 --> 01:04:55,573
Set it to receive a file.

685
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:07,628
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon
in the state of Washington.

686
01:05:09,046 --> 01:05:12,383
Forgery, embezzlement,
two drug convictions

687
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:16,763
plus jumping parole. Once arrested,
she will have no triaI,

688
01:05:16,888 --> 01:05:21,101
she will notpass 'Go',
she will go directly tojaiI.

689
01:05:21,226 --> 01:05:27,108
Then I change this file back to the original
and your mom disappears.

690
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:28,442
That's bullshit.

691
01:05:29,068 --> 01:05:32,989
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.

692
01:05:34,073 --> 01:05:39,830
Your mom will be arrested,
handcuffed and later strip-searched.

693
01:05:39,913 --> 01:05:42,624
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.

694
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,794
Kid, don't threaten me.

695
01:05:46,253 --> 01:05:50,883
There are worse things than death...
and I can do all of them.

696
01:06:30,301 --> 01:06:31,470
Talk to me.

697
01:06:31,595 --> 01:06:35,140
I got it. But Kate didn't know
what's on it,

698
01:06:35,265 --> 01:06:37,267
she came to me to figure it out.

699
01:06:38,143 --> 01:06:40,979
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.

700
01:06:41,104 --> 01:06:44,942
Don't worry, kid. Ifshe's innocent,

701
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:46,569
she'll be fine.

702
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,990
Your mommy's safe now, okay?

703
01:08:13,748 --> 01:08:14,707
Kate, Listen.

704
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,584
Hold on.

705
01:08:16,751 --> 01:08:19,503
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on!

706
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:23,008
- It's so lean and clean.
- Looks like a hacker wrote it.

707
01:08:23,717 --> 01:08:25,427
Come here. Look at this.

708
01:08:26,053 --> 01:08:27,846
This thing is tense.

709
01:08:28,889 --> 01:08:30,515
That's ill, man.

710
01:08:31,016 --> 01:08:32,477
It's incomplete.

711
01:08:33,853 --> 01:08:37,398
This'll take forever to figure out.
I'll make some coffee.

712
01:08:40,777 --> 01:08:42,236
Tag, you're in.

713
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:06,412
- It's not a virus. It's a worm.
- What's it eat?

714
01:10:06,579 --> 01:10:08,372
It nibbles. You see all of this?

715
01:10:08,497 --> 01:10:11,752
This is all of Ellingson's
financial transactions.

716
01:10:11,918 --> 01:10:15,422
From million dollar deals
to $10 some guy pays for gas.

717
01:10:15,589 --> 01:10:17,549
The worm eats a few cents
from each transaction.

718
01:10:17,716 --> 01:10:20,177
No-one's caught it because
the money isn't really gone.

719
01:10:20,344 --> 01:10:22,137
It's just data being shifted around.

720
01:10:22,304 --> 01:10:26,517
And when the worm's ready, it zips out
with the money and erases its tracks.

721
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:29,062
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.

722
01:10:29,228 --> 01:10:33,274
Here it's already running
at twice the speed as when it started.

723
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:36,111
- At this rate, the run ends in...
- .. two days.

724
01:10:36,278 --> 01:10:40,866
- It's already eaten about...
- .. 21.8 million bucks.

725
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:45,205
Whoever wrote this
needs someone to take the fall.

726
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:48,083
That's Phreak and Joey and us.

727
01:10:48,249 --> 01:10:52,462
We have to find out where the money's
going before the worm disappears,

728
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:54,923
so we can find out who created it.

729
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,300
I know who wrote it!

730
01:10:56,801 --> 01:10:57,677
What?

731
01:10:57,843 --> 01:10:59,470
This Ellingson security creep.

732
01:11:00,096 --> 01:11:03,182
I gave him a copy of the disk
you gave me.

733
01:11:03,349 --> 01:11:04,225
You what?

734
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:06,102
I didn't know what was on it.

735
01:11:06,227 --> 01:11:09,648
Oh, man! That's universally stupid, man.

736
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,358
Yo, man. You're an amateur.

737
01:11:13,026 --> 01:11:14,111
Why did he come to you?

738
01:11:14,277 --> 01:11:16,071
I've got a record.

739
01:11:16,488 --> 01:11:18,116
I was Zero Cool.

740
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:24,414
Zero Cool crashed 1,507 systems
in one day. Biggest crash in history.

741
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,583
Front page New York Times,
August 10, 1988.

742
01:11:28,919 --> 01:11:30,629
I thought you was black, man.

743
01:11:31,255 --> 01:11:33,590
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!

744
01:11:34,508 --> 01:11:35,592
That's far out!

745
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:37,136
This is Zero Cool, man!

746
01:11:38,554 --> 01:11:40,098
Yeah, that's great.

747
01:11:40,557 --> 01:11:41,474
There goes MIT.

748
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:43,727
- I'll make it up!
- How?

749
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,229
I'll hack the Gibson.

750
01:11:46,396 --> 01:11:48,398
They'll trace you like that, man.

751
01:11:48,565 --> 01:11:50,358
The cops will find you
with a smoking gun.

752
01:11:50,483 --> 01:11:51,736
Fucked if I care, man.

753
01:11:51,902 --> 01:11:55,072
Even with the password,
it'd take you ten minutes to get in,

754
01:11:55,239 --> 01:11:56,866
then you'd have to find the files.

755
01:11:56,991 --> 01:11:59,243
The cops would have you in five minutes.

756
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:02,080
Oh, wow! We are fried!

757
01:12:02,205 --> 01:12:04,708
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

758
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:06,960
With me, we can do it in seven.

759
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:09,755
I help, we do it in six.

760
01:12:09,921 --> 01:12:14,135
I gotta save all your asses!
I help, we do it in five minutes.

761
01:12:14,302 --> 01:12:16,763
Okay. Let's go shopping.

762
01:12:45,168 --> 01:12:46,253
You know,

763
01:12:46,879 --> 01:12:51,926
if I didn't live by a strict code of honour,
I might take advantage of this situation.

764
01:12:52,051 --> 01:12:54,095
Erotically, as it were.

765
01:13:18,788 --> 01:13:20,708
All right. Hold it right there.

766
01:13:25,963 --> 01:13:27,297
Shit!

767
01:13:27,423 --> 01:13:29,466
My subway defence system.

768
01:13:35,223 --> 01:13:36,766
He's way down there.

769
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,561
Ta-da!

770
01:13:40,103 --> 01:13:43,607
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!

771
01:13:49,655 --> 01:13:50,656
Hey!

772
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,241
Truck!

773
01:13:56,455 --> 01:13:57,456
Find it?

774
01:13:58,749 --> 01:14:02,085
The phone's all right. The problem
must be somewhere else.

775
01:14:42,004 --> 01:14:46,258
They had a large chunk
of the garbage file?

776
01:14:49,054 --> 01:14:52,641
- How much do they know?
- Enough to implicate us.

777
01:14:52,766 --> 01:14:55,435
You said the worm was untraceable.

778
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,522
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.

779
01:14:58,648 --> 01:15:02,318
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.

780
01:15:02,985 --> 01:15:05,905
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?

781
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:09,785
- You can't do that.
- No-one believes the guilty.

782
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:15,791
By the time they realise the truth,
we'll be long gone with all our money.

783
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:19,670
Look, there is no right and wrong.

784
01:15:19,878 --> 01:15:22,757
There is only fun... and boring.

785
01:15:23,758 --> 01:15:27,345
A 30-year prison sentence
sounds pretty dull to me.

786
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,139
Who do you prefer serves it?

787
01:15:29,264 --> 01:15:31,851
Us... or them?

788
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:55,084
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in seven days,

789
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:58,254
I will capsize five Ellingson tankers.

790
01:15:58,379 --> 01:16:00,757
The virus goes off
tomorrow at 10.30AM,

791
01:16:00,882 --> 01:16:03,593
and those hackers tried
to get into our system again.

792
01:16:03,718 --> 01:16:06,722
I insist you take more strenuous action

793
01:16:06,847 --> 01:16:10,809
or Ellingson Mineral will hold
the Secret Service responsible.

794
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,901
Get me arrest warrants
on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,

795
01:16:18,026 --> 01:16:20,445
Emmanuel Goldstein,
alias Cereal Killer,

796
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:23,531
Dade Murphy,
alias Crash Override, also known as

797
01:16:23,656 --> 01:16:28,579
Zero CooI, and PauI Cook,
alias Lord Nikon.

798
01:16:28,913 --> 01:16:31,374
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.

799
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:34,251
Snoop on to them

800
01:16:34,377 --> 01:16:36,420
as they snoop on to us.

801
01:16:41,635 --> 01:16:46,223
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn. We got a little problem.

802
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:05,369
So, what've we got?

803
01:17:05,494 --> 01:17:10,040
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever
Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.

804
01:17:10,165 --> 01:17:11,793
I got a lot, right?

805
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:13,962
I don't know how many, but...

806
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:16,047
my head hurts.

807
01:17:16,172 --> 01:17:17,674
Yo, check this out.

808
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,176
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?

809
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:25,099
It's a memo about how they'll deal with
the oil spills that happened on the 14th.

810
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:27,560
What oil spills?

811
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:33,400
- Brain-dead. Today's the 13th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.

812
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:36,278
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.

813
01:17:39,031 --> 01:17:42,617
Isn't the da Vinci virus
what Phreak's being charged with?

814
01:17:42,743 --> 01:17:46,748
Look. 'Infecting ballast programs
of Ellingson tankers'.

815
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,166
They blame hackers!

816
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:49,292
Damn!

817
01:17:49,584 --> 01:17:51,544
A worm and a virus?

818
01:17:51,711 --> 01:17:53,254
The plot thickens.

819
01:17:59,303 --> 01:18:01,180
Whoa, whoa! Where are you going?

820
01:18:01,305 --> 01:18:02,306
I got an idea.

821
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:05,267
We got a few hours until we're arrested.

822
01:18:05,392 --> 01:18:08,313
Stay low. I'm going to get help.

823
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:10,065
I'll beep you.

824
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:13,568
Are you coming?

825
01:18:18,074 --> 01:18:20,117
May the Force be with you, man.

826
01:18:48,564 --> 01:18:50,024
There they are!

827
01:18:50,567 --> 01:18:53,946
Razor and Blade?! They're flakes!

828
01:18:54,113 --> 01:18:57,574
They're elite! Let's get 'em.

829
01:19:49,465 --> 01:19:52,634
Get off the stage, man! Get off!

830
01:20:16,285 --> 01:20:17,745
I lost them!

831
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,749
Where were you?

832
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:37,725
I don't like this.

833
01:20:42,731 --> 01:20:44,983
I definitely don't like this.

834
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:47,361
What do you want?

835
01:20:51,323 --> 01:20:53,410
We come in peace.

836
01:20:55,537 --> 01:20:58,206
We need your help, if you're up to it.

837
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:01,710
She's buff. Ballsy.

838
01:21:02,752 --> 01:21:03,796
Let's keep her.

839
01:21:03,963 --> 01:21:05,089
Waste the dude.

840
01:21:12,096 --> 01:21:16,893
A virus called da Vinci will cause
oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.

841
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:19,730
It's somehow connected to that worm.

842
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:24,735
We need you to overload the Gibson so
we can kill da Vinci and copy the worm.

843
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:28,156
She's rabid... but cute.

844
01:21:28,656 --> 01:21:31,325
See, we're very busy.

845
01:21:31,492 --> 01:21:37,583
A TV network that wishes to remain
nameless is interested in our show.

846
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,877
Let's go, Kate.

847
01:21:42,755 --> 01:21:44,131
Wait.

848
01:21:45,007 --> 01:21:47,009
Nobody said no.

849
01:21:47,594 --> 01:21:51,806
But you will need more than
just two media icons like us.

850
01:21:52,348 --> 01:21:53,308
You need an army.

851
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:58,647
That's it. An electronic army.
If I were us,

852
01:21:58,814 --> 01:22:02,693
I'd get on the Internet,
send out a major distress signal.

853
01:22:03,277 --> 01:22:04,737
Hackers of the world, unite!

854
01:22:05,029 --> 01:22:06,655
How will you take care of the cops?

855
01:22:27,303 --> 01:22:28,805
I'm blowing up!

856
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:31,517
It's Kate. Grand Central.
Let's hit it!

857
01:23:40,175 --> 01:23:41,259
You're the man!

858
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,219
You're the man!

859
01:24:03,992 --> 01:24:05,911
Joey, you made it!

860
01:24:10,415 --> 01:24:13,127
Okay. Use your best viruses
to buy us some time.

861
01:24:13,252 --> 01:24:15,088
We must get in and copy the worm.

862
01:24:17,632 --> 01:24:19,675
I had to do that to break the tension.

863
01:24:20,551 --> 01:24:23,263
- Cereal. Go fix the phones.
- Roger.

864
01:24:25,516 --> 01:24:27,309
Joey, take his place.

865
01:24:28,519 --> 01:24:30,437
- Me?
- Take his place. Do it.

866
01:24:30,646 --> 01:24:32,064
You can do it.

867
01:24:33,108 --> 01:24:34,109
Ready?

868
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:37,445
Let's boot up.

869
01:25:33,298 --> 01:25:36,843
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a minor glitch.

870
01:25:36,968 --> 01:25:40,181
A minor glitch with you seems
to turn into a major catastrophe.

871
01:25:46,353 --> 01:25:48,355
There's a new virus in the database.

872
01:25:48,481 --> 01:25:49,732
What's happening?

873
01:25:49,857 --> 01:25:51,985
It's eating memory. What do I do?

874
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:53,278
Type 'cookie', you idiot.

875
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:55,322
I'll head them off at the pass.

876
01:25:59,576 --> 01:26:02,121
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.

877
01:26:02,246 --> 01:26:04,624
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.

878
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:13,509
Die, dickweeds!

879
01:26:17,179 --> 01:26:18,764
A rabbit's in the system.

880
01:26:18,889 --> 01:26:19,765
Send a flu shot.

881
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:22,643
Rabbit? Flu shot? Someone talk to me.

882
01:26:22,768 --> 01:26:26,898
A rabbit replicates till it overloads
a file then spreads like cancer.

883
01:26:27,023 --> 01:26:28,108
Cancer?

884
01:26:28,942 --> 01:26:33,071
Row, row, row your boat

885
01:26:33,196 --> 01:26:35,574
Gently down the stream.

886
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:38,619
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,

887
01:26:38,744 --> 01:26:41,163
Life is but a dream.

888
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:44,417
Whoa! Falling off!

889
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:47,045
It's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.

890
01:27:02,728 --> 01:27:05,565
There's too many garbage files.
I need more time.

891
01:27:12,281 --> 01:27:17,035
They're at Grand Central station,
lower level. Don't screw up.

892
01:27:17,161 --> 01:27:18,621
Get out of here!

893
01:27:18,747 --> 01:27:21,875
Everyone, let's move! Move it!

894
01:27:22,292 --> 01:27:24,127
Get the hell out of the way! Come on!

895
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:25,920
Grand Central!

896
01:27:30,217 --> 01:27:34,054
Game's over. Last chance to get out
of this without a prison sentence.

897
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:35,514
You're not good enough to beat me.

898
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:39,310
Maybe I'm not. But we are,

899
01:27:39,435 --> 01:27:41,897
- you asshole!
- Give it up!

900
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:45,692
Just give it up.

901
01:27:49,488 --> 01:27:50,947
Are we fashionably late?

902
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:58,206
Okay, let's go!

903
01:29:05,237 --> 01:29:08,657
We have massive infection.
Multiple GPl viruses...

904
01:29:08,782 --> 01:29:10,034
.. from remote nodes.

905
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:12,662
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?

906
01:29:12,787 --> 01:29:14,831
The command processor. The brain!

907
01:29:14,956 --> 01:29:17,041
Cancer, brain. Brain cancer!

908
01:29:17,709 --> 01:29:18,835
What's going on?

909
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,338
In short, Duke, a shitstorm.

910
01:29:23,382 --> 01:29:25,259
Move! Go!

911
01:30:06,429 --> 01:30:08,014
I found it!

912
01:30:08,723 --> 01:30:10,016
I found it!

913
01:30:34,584 --> 01:30:37,045
This is the end, my friend.

914
01:30:38,714 --> 01:30:40,007
Thank you for calling.

915
01:30:43,594 --> 01:30:44,637
Shit!

916
01:30:44,804 --> 01:30:46,097
He got me!

917
01:30:46,764 --> 01:30:48,015
Joey's gettin' stupid busy.

918
01:30:49,518 --> 01:30:53,021
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.

919
01:30:54,523 --> 01:30:58,026
It's root, slash, period, 'workspace',

920
01:30:58,152 --> 01:31:00,905
slash, period, 'garbage', period.

921
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,743
Out of the way!

922
01:31:09,164 --> 01:31:11,459
Out of the way! Freeze!

923
01:31:15,463 --> 01:31:16,046
Come on!

924
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:42,867
All right! Wow!

925
01:31:44,745 --> 01:31:45,829
Kill the Gibson!

926
01:31:45,954 --> 01:31:46,955
Roger that.

927
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:55,882
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Is that all you got?

928
01:31:56,466 --> 01:31:58,885
Come on! Let's see what else you can do.

929
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:03,932
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts? Come at me!

930
01:32:07,645 --> 01:32:09,438
They're in the kernel.

931
01:32:09,563 --> 01:32:10,773
Help me!

932
01:32:13,442 --> 01:32:16,362
The tankers have stopped capsizing.

933
01:32:16,487 --> 01:32:18,240
Ballast tanks emptying.

934
01:32:18,365 --> 01:32:19,825
Should be okay.

935
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:34,799
Little pissant!

936
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:48,188
Yes!

937
01:32:50,483 --> 01:32:52,026
Let's get outta here!

938
01:32:52,152 --> 01:32:52,902
Freeze!

939
01:33:12,966 --> 01:33:15,177
They're trashing our rights, man.

940
01:33:15,343 --> 01:33:18,346
They're trashing the flow of data.

941
01:33:18,513 --> 01:33:19,681
Trashing!

942
01:33:19,973 --> 01:33:21,057
Trashing!

943
01:33:21,349 --> 01:33:22,350
Trashing!

944
01:33:23,269 --> 01:33:24,979
Hack the planet!

945
01:33:25,271 --> 01:33:27,148
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in!

946
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:29,108
Hack the planet!

947
01:33:29,358 --> 01:33:30,693
Hack the planet!

948
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:40,621
- Hello.
- We caught them.

949
01:33:40,788 --> 01:33:42,664
- Good.
- Red-handed.

950
01:33:43,624 --> 01:33:45,835
You won't be having
any more trouble from them.

951
01:33:59,225 --> 01:34:03,854
Me, all right? I did it.
She knows shit about computers.

952
01:34:05,564 --> 01:34:07,275
She's just my girlfriend.

953
01:34:10,112 --> 01:34:12,572
I suggest you modify your attitude,

954
01:34:12,697 --> 01:34:14,407
because you are floating

955
01:34:14,533 --> 01:34:16,326
and I am about to flush your ass.

956
01:34:17,994 --> 01:34:21,165
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.

957
01:34:28,464 --> 01:34:31,426
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.

958
01:34:37,933 --> 01:34:39,643
- Dade.
- What?

959
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,105
Thanks for your help.

960
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:50,738
Your son is in big trouble.

961
01:34:51,072 --> 01:34:55,453
He violated his probation and
has engaged in criminal activities.

962
01:34:56,328 --> 01:34:58,539
My son happens to be a genius.

963
01:34:58,664 --> 01:35:02,794
He understands things that you won't
comprehend if you live to be 100.

964
01:35:02,919 --> 01:35:05,547
He would never use his knowledge
to harm others.

965
01:35:05,672 --> 01:35:07,716
The news crew you requested is here.

966
01:35:07,841 --> 01:35:09,968
Good. I have some things to tell them.

967
01:35:10,218 --> 01:35:14,056
Your son is facing 30 felony counts
in an ongoing investigation.

968
01:35:14,223 --> 01:35:16,601
You face arrest if you do that.

969
01:35:16,726 --> 01:35:18,519
I don't care if I face certain death.

970
01:35:18,644 --> 01:35:21,355
Mrs Murphy stays right here.

971
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:25,277
Wow. She's great.

972
01:35:26,779 --> 01:35:27,446
Yeah.

973
01:35:30,115 --> 01:35:31,283
.. and attacked the Ellingson network.

974
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:34,536
Is this the last we've seen
of this kind ofespionage?

975
01:35:35,705 --> 01:35:38,792
No. Hackers are a grave threat
to the national security.

976
01:35:38,917 --> 01:35:41,878
This incident just proves
that we need

977
01:35:42,003 --> 01:35:44,547
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.

978
01:35:44,714 --> 01:35:47,009
Hola, boys and girls.
It is I, CereaI Killer,

979
01:35:47,134 --> 01:35:52,306
making my first worldwide
globaI television appearance.

980
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:55,142
Yes, that's right.

981
01:35:55,309 --> 01:35:58,814
I'm here to tell you about this heinous
scheme hatched within Ellingson MineraI.

982
01:35:59,898 --> 01:36:00,732
But for what?

983
01:36:00,899 --> 01:36:03,443
World domination? Nay.

984
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:06,905
Something far more tacky.

985
01:36:07,364 --> 01:36:13,121
A virus called da Vinci, that would cause
Ellingson tankers to capsize,

986
01:36:13,246 --> 01:36:17,959
was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
This virus was really a smokescreen.

987
01:36:18,084 --> 01:36:24,925
What could be so important to protect
that someone would create such a nasty,

988
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:27,886
anti-sociaI, uncooI virus program?

989
01:36:28,011 --> 01:36:29,096
But why?

990
01:36:29,638 --> 01:36:32,183
Could it be to cover the tracks
of this worm program?

991
01:36:32,308 --> 01:36:35,395
A worm that was to steaI 25 million bucks.

992
01:36:35,645 --> 01:36:38,565
The password for this worm
belongs to Margo Wallace,

993
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:41,734
- head ofPublic Relations at Ellingson.
- Oh, my God!

994
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:43,779
And Eugene Belford,

995
01:36:43,904 --> 01:36:47,408
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!

996
01:36:48,075 --> 01:36:52,956
What's this? The account in the Bahamas
where the money was to be stashed?

997
01:36:53,081 --> 01:36:54,166
I think so.

998
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:56,042
Unlucky!

999
01:36:57,919 --> 01:36:59,087
Yo.

1000
01:36:59,212 --> 01:37:01,089
I kinda feeI like God.

1001
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,638
Plague?

1002
01:37:10,141 --> 01:37:11,142
Eugene?

1003
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:27,285
I don't even know how to work the VCR
let alone a computer. Get off!

1004
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:33,249
Listen, I'll make a deal. Eugene Belford.
I know where his mother is.

1005
01:37:33,374 --> 01:37:35,835
Get off me! I need a lawyer!

1006
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:48,391
Here you are, Mr Babbage.

1007
01:37:48,517 --> 01:37:52,604
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can I get you anything else?

1008
01:37:52,729 --> 01:37:55,106
Just a pillow, please.

1009
01:38:01,447 --> 01:38:02,532
Thank you.

1010
01:38:04,992 --> 01:38:06,828
You're welcome.

1011
01:38:06,953 --> 01:38:09,664
What's going on? Let go of me!
Stewardess!

1012
01:38:09,789 --> 01:38:12,501
I'll never fly this airline again!

1013
01:38:23,054 --> 01:38:25,181
You look good in a dress.

1014
01:38:26,266 --> 01:38:28,143
You would have looked better.

1015
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,777
Wanna go for a swim?

1016
01:38:47,497 --> 01:38:50,500
I can't believe they decided you won.

1017
01:38:51,501 --> 01:38:55,882
They didn't. The guys felt it was
the only way I'd get a date.

1018
01:38:59,093 --> 01:39:00,261
Anyway,

1019
01:39:02,054 --> 01:39:03,764
you're pretty good.

1020
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:05,601
You're elite.

1021
01:39:07,352 --> 01:39:08,520
Yeah?

1022
01:39:09,062 --> 01:39:13,775
If you'd said that at the start,
you would have avoided a lot of trouble.

1023
01:39:25,872 --> 01:39:27,332
Beat that!

1024
01:39:40,931 --> 01:39:42,140
You know,

1025
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:48,021
- I've been having these weird...
- .. dreams.

1026
