1
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:53,825
Okay. One picture
and we're history.

2
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:57,105
That's what I'm afraid of.

3
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,225
Come on.

4
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:19,105
<i>Oh, man, do we
have to do this?</i>

5
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:21,945
You want everyone at school
to think we're chicken?

6
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:24,825
I could live with that.
You wuss. Come on.

7
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:33,665
Oh, whoa!
Oh, man!

8
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:38,705
I- I don't see anything.
Do you?

9
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:41,185
No, I don't
see anything.

10
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,305
Let's just take the picture
and get outta here.

11
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,425
Fine, fine. Here,
take the picture.

12
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:54,905
Now, wait a minute. I gotta be in the picture
too, or no one will believe I was here.

13
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:57,345
Just shut up and take the
picture. No, you take the picture.

14
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,265
You take it.
You!

15
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:02,865
<i>Guys, guys, don't fight.
I'll take the picture.</i>

16
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:04,785
<i>Say cheese!</i>

17
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:09,145
<i>A ghost!</i>

18
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:40,025
<i>And to the Save The Dolphins
Foundation: $11 million.</i>

19
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:45,185
To the Save The Pumas
Foundation: $1.2 million.

20
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:50,625
To the Patagonian Wasp
Salvation Fund: $1.4 million.

21
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:54,745
<i>To the Dyslexic
Dalmatians Foundation:4...</i>

22
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:57,745
To hell with the livestock.
What'd the old stiff leave me?

23
00:02:57,825 --> 00:03:01,025
Um, I believe that
what the bereaved...

24
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:04,865
is trying to express
is that the sudden death...

25
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:08,825
<i>of her only father has
left a great gaping void...</i>

26
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:11,025
in her bank...
in her life.

27
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:15,905
Carrigan wonders what he has
left her to fill it up with.

28
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:19,465
Hmm. Let's see.

29
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:22,105
Bobcats, owls,

30
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:24,585
<i>snakes.</i>

31
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:27,265
<i>Daughter: Carrigan.</i>

32
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:29,465
Whipstaff Manor in Maine.

33
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:31,745
And?

34
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:35,105
And I'm late for lunch,
so if you'll excuse me.

35
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:38,625
Are you trying to tell me that
I just spent the last two days...

36
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:41,425
holding his clammy hand,
waiting for him to kick,

37
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:44,025
and all I get in return
is one lousy piece of property?

38
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:48,385
<i>No, it was lousy 50 years ago.
Now it's condemned.</i>

39
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:50,305
Enjoy.

40
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,465
Wait a minute!
This is not fair!

41
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:58,865
<i>I'll contest it, then I'm gonna drag you and
every one of those damn dolphins into court!</i>

42
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:01,105
Knock yourself out.

43
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:05,185
Dibs! This is all
your fault, as usual.

44
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:07,825
If you would have just
forged the damn will.

45
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:10,705
<i>Carrigan, this is
condemned seafront property.</i>

46
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:13,585
Oh, Dibs!
Don't you get it?

47
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:15,585
Flipper got more money
than me.

48
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:18,705
Carrigan,
the deed's in there!

49
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:20,665
Oh! Ouch!

50
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:23,545
Ow. Ouch!

51
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:32,225
"Buccaneers
and buried gold.

52
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:35,905
Whipstaff doth
a treasure hold."

53
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,225
Treasure? Dibs, you idiot! Get it out!

54
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:53,225
I knew that place was worth something.
There's treasure in that house.

55
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:57,345
And finally, I'm gonna
get what I deserve.

56
00:04:57,425 --> 00:05:01,665
Carrigan, I think I need a doctor.
Oh, there's plenty in Maine.

57
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:21,625
So... what do you think?

58
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:24,945
I think you're
gonna get wet.

59
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:34,785
Hey! Wait!
Carrigan!

60
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:37,185
Carrigan!

61
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,465
Dibs, light, light!

62
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:52,505
What a dump.

63
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:58,145
<i>Wow. Wow!</i>

64
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:02,945
This place is fabulous. You
could just do so much with it.

65
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:07,705
I mean, it's a bit spooky. Dibs.

66
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:11,185
Aaah! Aaah!

67
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:13,785
<i>Hello.
Huh?</i>

68
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:17,025
Who is it?
Who is it?

69
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:19,345
<i>Afraid I can't
answer that.</i>

70
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:21,305
Why not?
Why not?

71
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:23,705
<i>It's kind of hard
to explain. Uh...</i>

72
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:26,505
Is he the caretaker?
Are you the caretaker?

73
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:29,145
<i>No!
Is he a transient?</i>

74
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:33,745
<i>Is he... Are you a
transient? No, not exactly.</i>

75
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:36,145
Tell him to show himself. Show yourself!

76
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:39,745
<i>Here's the thing.
If I do, don't scream, okay?</i>

77
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:41,785
<i>I get that a lot.</i>

78
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:46,145
Are you a burglar? I must
warn you that I am armed.

79
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:49,962
Hello?

80
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:50,746
Listen!

81
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:54,473
If you don't show yourself, I'm gonna
have you arrested for trespassing!

82
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:57,393
<i>Okay, okay. Geez, calm
down, lady. Here I come!</i>

83
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:03,513
Hi! I'm Casper!

84
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,593
You shouldn't do that
or you'll wake up...

85
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:11,953
Too late.

86
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,513
So tell me,
you have experience?

87
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:49,233
I have-a quite a bit
of experience.

88
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:51,793
Not, you know,
like, exactly doin' it.

89
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:55,593
But I've studied it, and I've
talked to people who have done it.

90
00:07:55,673 --> 00:08:00,113
I've-a seen videos, and I feel very
confident with-a my knowledge...

91
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:02,033
I could do it,
no problem.

92
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:05,193
Then you can handle
this? It's-a no problem.

93
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:09,873
<i>It's-a like no problem whatsoever.
Piece of cake. Piece of crumb cake.</i>

94
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:50,353
Well?
How did it go?

95
00:08:50,393 --> 00:08:54,673
Oh, it was-a fine. Was, uh,
no problem. Piece of cake.

96
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:04,113
Who you gonna call?

97
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:06,353
Someone else.

98
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,393
What do we do now?

99
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,753
What do I usually do when
something stands in my way?

100
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:19,312
<i>Check those fuses!</i>

101
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:24,659
Um, are you sure we're not
going a tad overboard here?

102
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:27,819
Dibs, I have huffed and puffed.
Now I want to rip this place down.

103
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:31,397
I want my treasure--

104
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,040
<i>People, people, please!</i>

105
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:35,582
You're sweaty male
construction types!

106
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:38,197
Dibs, do something.

107
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:47,997
Charlie, quick, keep runnin'!
Don't look back! Run, Charlie, run!

108
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:52,477
<i>Wait, wait. They were
just kidding. Honest!</i>

109
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:56,757
Oh, every time.
All I want's a friend.

110
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:01,157
Did you ever feel the way
Priscilla Cow felt?

111
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:04,837
That you'd like to be
completely different?

112
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:08,557
Almost everybody feels
like that once in a while.

113
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:13,477
But most of the time, I hope
you can be glad to be yourself.

114
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:16,877
That's really
something to celebrate.

115
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:21,597
A g-g-ghost!

116
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:27,997
More on the Pentagon playboys
as the story unfolds, but now:

117
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:31,637
Step aside, Sigmund Freud.
Jump back, Joyce Brothers.

118
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:35,357
It's Dr. James Harvey,
therapist to the dead?

119
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:37,717
Are you depressed, anxious?

120
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:40,317
Are you lonely?
Do you need someone to talk to?

121
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:43,437
No problem,
if you're a ghost.

122
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,797
You can call them ghosts,
if you like, or as I prefer,

123
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:49,717
the living impaired.

124
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:53,517
But the bottom line is,
they need help sometimes.

125
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:55,597
Just like the rest of us.

126
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:58,997
After the sudden, unexpected
death of his wife Amelia,

127
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:04,117
Dr. Harvey gave up conventional psychiatry
and, some say, conventional sanity.

128
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,477
Now, along with his loner
daughter, Kat... short for Kathy...

129
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:12,717
Doc Harvey travels from town to town,
searching for paranoid poltergeists,

130
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,117
scared specters,
the depressed and the dead.

131
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,837
How do you feel about what
your father does for a living?

132
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,797
Could you please
not ask me any questions?

133
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:24,837
Do you believe in ghosts? Ever seen
one? Does your father ever hurt you?

134
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,037
He's my father.
Could you just talk to us?

135
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:30,717
Look, it's the first day of school.

136
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:33,397
I'm sure I'm gonna have homework,
so would you please?

137
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:40,063
Carrigan.

138
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,028
<i>What part don't
you understand?</i>

139
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,588
But who is this man...

140
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:02,908
No, not "I ate fish." I hate
fish. Don't you have cows here?

141
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:05,788
Listen, I have had
a long and trying day.

142
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:10,908
Do you think you could bring me a pint of
Haagen-Dazs ice cream, rum raisin, and a Diet Pepsi?

143
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,828
Think you can handle that?

144
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:18,468
Now you want me to hold.
Fine.

145
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:21,348
With therapy, they can
begin to process this pain.

146
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:25,308
They can pack up their emotional
baggage, and they can move on.

147
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:28,468
My Harry passed away
five years ago,

148
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:32,308
but he was so miserable, his
spirit wouldn't leave the apartment.

149
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:35,668
So I called Dr. Harvey.
He came over.

150
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:39,988
And in a few weeks,
Harry left, smiling.

151
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:44,348
<i>The living impaired
are known for haunting us.</i>

152
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:46,428
<i>My question is,
what's haunting them?</i>

153
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:49,308
It's a lack of resolution.

154
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:53,588
Ghosts are simply spirits without
resolution, with unfinished business.

155
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:55,868
It's my job to find out
what that is.

156
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:01,348
<i>And so Dr. Harvey continues his work,
dragging his daughter along for the ride.</i>

157
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:05,508
This week they're in Santa Fe.
But next week? Boo knows?

158
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:08,748
<i>Now, from the ghost shrink to
shrinking thighs. Yes, I'm still here.</i>

159
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:11,868
<i>- The miracle fat cream
experiment, next. - Get me Santa Fe.</i>

160
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:23,868
<i># That's life #</i>

161
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:26,308
<i># That's life #
# That's life #</i>

162
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,268
# That's what
all the people say #

163
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:32,388
# You're ridin' high in April
shot down in... #

164
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:39,308
Oh, honey, I'm sorry about
your Cactus Spooners. Crooners.

165
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:42,628
I don't care what they said.
You are not demented.

166
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:45,828
<i>You're a picture of mental health.
They were talking about you.</i>

167
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:50,428
Try explaining afterlife therapy
to a bunch of junior high kids.

168
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:54,628
Some people go through life
never questioning the norm.

169
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,988
But you and I, we're doing something
extraordinary with our lives.

170
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:00,548
<i>No, we aren't doing anything.</i>

171
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:05,908
You're the one who's been packing up my
stuff and moving me around the country.

172
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:09,108
In two years, I have been
to nine different schools.

173
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:11,988
I have eaten in nine
different cafeterias.

174
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:14,468
I can't even
remember anyone's name.

175
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:17,868
For once, I would
just like to be...

176
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:20,748
in one place long enough
to make a friend.

177
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:24,028
Honey, you will.

178
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:27,028
I mean, come on. We're
movin' to Friendship, Maine.

179
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:29,268
Even I might make one.
You better, Dad.

180
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:32,828
'Cause a single guy your age is more
likely to become a bank hostage...

181
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,788
than to make new friends.

182
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:40,362
You sound like your mother.

183
00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:43,936
You're not gonna find her.

184
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,056
Mom's not a ghost, Dad.

185
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:51,656
Oh, yes, she is.
She has unfinished business.

186
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:54,656
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

187
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:06,496
I'll tell you what. You go
with me this one last time.

188
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:10,376
If I don't find what
I'm looking for, it's over.

189
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,256
No more moving,
no more ghost mining.

190
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:15,336
You promise?

191
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:19,056
I promise.

192
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:25,256
Deal.

193
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:54,416
Wow! It's not
so bad, huh?

194
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,871
If you're Stephen King.

195
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:04,671
Dr. Harvey, hello.
I'm Carrigan Crittenden.

196
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:06,631
And this is Dibs.
Hello.

197
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:09,271
I'm a close,
personal friend.

198
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:12,791
Ah.
And this is my daughter, Kat.

199
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,191
His close,
personal daughter.

200
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:19,071
- How nice to meet you, Kat.
- Very nice to meet you.

201
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:22,031
- You have a beautiful daughter.
- Very beautiful.

202
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:25,231
I can't tell you how happy we
are you could come to Whipstaff.

203
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,791
- Very happy.
- The both of us.

204
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:31,711
You're kind of
hurting my face.

205
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,671
Sorry. Now, Dr. Harvey,

206
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:37,871
<i>exactly what time frame
are you looking at?</i>

207
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:40,911
Tell me you go in the house
and spray and that's it.

208
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:43,431
Pssssst!
No, no, no.

209
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:47,511
As with a traditional psychological
cure, it can take weeks or years for...

210
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:51,151
Excuse me. You didn't just
say the word "years," did you?

211
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:54,271
It's conceivable.
No, it isn't.

212
00:17:54,351 --> 00:17:58,311
- Days is conceivable. Weeks, maybe.
- Possibly.

213
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:02,951
- Months? No. Years? Forget it!
- Forget it.

214
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,391
Dibs, check.

215
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:08,631
Get the bouquet.
Now, Dr. Harvey.

216
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:11,431
I will be watching you
very closely.

217
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:17,991
These are for you!
Have a lovely night.

218
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:51,734
Wow.

219
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:57,624
It's her. She's here.
She's in my house. I did it!

220
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:00,824
What if she likes me?
What if she doesn't?

221
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:04,504
Hi, I'm Casper.
I'm a ghost?

222
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:07,984
No, that's total disaster. Oh!

223
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,904
Yo, I'm Casper.
So, give me four.

224
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,544
Oh, God,
I'd kill for a pinky.

225
00:19:21,197 --> 00:19:24,597
Huh? See?
That was easy.

226
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:29,757
Yeah. These should hold for now, but we
ought to get a box of 20 amps in the morning.

227
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:32,717
Oh, uh,
right, yeah.

228
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,317
Uh, twenties
should be fine.

229
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:39,077
All right, I'm gonna
go find a room, Dad.

230
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,037
You gonna be
all right alone?

231
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:45,837
Hey, if I'm not back in ten
days, send a search party.

232
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,317
<i>"Stretch,"</i>

233
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:30,677
<i>"Fatso"...</i>

234
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:32,637
<i>and "Stinkie"?</i>

235
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:36,277
Man, they had cruel parents.

236
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:38,277
Wonder where
Doc and Dopey sleep.

237
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:07,364
Dad! I found my room.

238
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:16,061
There's a girl...
on my bed. Yes!

239
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:23,341
Hey, space master.

240
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:25,821
In here.
Oh.

241
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,381
<i>It's very scary.</i>

242
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,941
Have you seen
any surprises yet?

243
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:34,141
Please. This is
the deadest place yet.

244
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:36,221
Oh, this is
a nice room.

245
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:40,101
Yeah, right. This place
is a freak's holiday.

246
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:41,581
Hi... Ooh! Ooh!

247
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:49,935
<i>- Oh.
- Oh.</i>

248
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:52,901
Mom belongs over here.

249
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:57,221
Hey, how about
if I help you unpack?

250
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:03,681
Why bother? We'll just be repacking
in two weeks anyway, right?

251
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:11,729
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
This place is... fine.

252
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:19,289
Good. Night, Bucket.

253
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,329
Night, Dad.

254
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,689
We're gonna be glad we came.
You watch.

255
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:37,929
Wh... Whoa!

256
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:57,409
Ooh, ooh!

257
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:18,289
Uh...

258
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:24,329
I... No.

259
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:30,169
I...

260
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:43,529
Uh...
Uh... Hi?

261
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:48,929
Oh, man!

262
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,929
Perfect first impression.
What a jerk.

263
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:05,889
Better?

264
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:10,649
<i>Honey?</i>

265
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:12,809
Hon... Honey?
Honey, what?

266
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:15,089
Dad, Dad,
I saw a ghost!

267
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:17,689
- It was a real ghost. It was a
real, live ghost. - Slow down. What?

268
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:22,649
I saw a ghost. It had a head, and it was
round, and it was white and see-through.

269
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:25,409
- Honey, wait. Now maybe...
- Dad, please.

270
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:28,929
Do not think I'm as crazy as
I thought you were. I promise.

271
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,329
No, no, no. But remember,
ghosts can't hurt you, okay?

272
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:35,449
They're simply spirits
with unfinished business.

273
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:38,569
Let's just see
about this ghost.

274
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:40,489
Come here. Come on.

275
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:45,329
Check here. Oop, see?
No ghost there.

276
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,409
Now we can check over here.

277
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:50,009
Nope.

278
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:53,249
Oh! No, there's
no ghost in there.

279
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:56,249
We can even check over here.

280
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:00,169
There. See?

281
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,129
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

282
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:11,969
Dad!
Put me down!

283
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:14,889
This is insane.
What are you doing?

284
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:16,809
I can walk, you know?

285
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,249
<i>Oh, my God,
this is big.</i>

286
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:26,449
<i>Um, Dad?
What?</i>

287
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:28,929
<i>We're in a closet.</i>

288
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:33,049
Right. Now, I want you
to stay in here...

289
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,309
no matter what
you hear, okay?

290
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:36,285
- Okay.
- Okay.

291
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:38,285
Wait.
What?

292
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:40,485
Dad, I'm sorry.
For what?

293
00:25:40,565 --> 00:25:44,485
For not believing you. For
thinking you were a total loser.

294
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:48,965
Aw, honey...
Apologize later.

295
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:52,125
Blew it, blew it,
blew it, blew it...

296
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:55,685
<i>Yee-haw!
Uh-oh, it's them.</i>

297
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:59,165
Here they come!

298
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:02,325
Yee-haw!

299
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:06,125
Man, oh, man, them ponies run
faster when we go down to Belmont.

300
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:09,005
Here, Flicka.
Bleaaugh!

301
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:11,445
Hey, guys.
Have fun?

302
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:14,645
Oh, look, it's Casper.
Casper.

303
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:17,405
You know on a scale of one
to ten... ten being fun,

304
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:21,885
and one being you...
yeah, we had fun.

305
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:24,005
Giddyup there.

306
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:27,205
Say, bulbhead, why ain't you
inside doin' your chores?

307
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:30,725
Yeah, where's dinner? I'm
starvin'. I'm wastin' away.

308
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:35,285
I know. How about you guys relax out
here, and tonight we'll eat al fresco?

309
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:37,365
Hey, sounds great.
Who's that?

310
00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:41,005
Short sheet, you wouldn't be trying
to keep us outta the house, would ya?

311
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:45,445
No! No! I can see right through
that bulbous head of yours.

312
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:47,525
It's just such
a lovely night.

313
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,565
I thought we'd have fun
eating under the harvest moon.

314
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:52,885
# Shine on #

315
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:57,085
# Shine on, harvest moon
Up in the sky #

316
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:00,725
<i>Aaah!
Bye-bye!</i>

317
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:06,125
Hey, hold it.

318
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:09,765
Hey, Fatso, you smell somethin'? Yeah!

319
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:12,605
<i>No, besides him.
Hello?</i>

320
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:15,885
Huh? Hey!

321
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:22,565
<i>Hello?</i>

322
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:26,125
<i>No need to be afraid.</i>

323
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:30,085
The idea, don't be afraid.

324
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:34,845
I'd like to make contact with you,
but just one little thing, please.

325
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:39,525
Don't pop out from under a rug
or through a keyhole. No spooking.

326
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:44,005
Let's get beyond that.
I would like to approach you.

327
00:27:44,085 --> 00:27:46,925
Now, I'm coming
in the room now.

328
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,885
I'm in, in the room.

329
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:54,645
Can ya deal with that?

330
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:57,925
<i>Can you?</i>

331
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:04,765
Dive!
Dive!

332
00:28:04,845 --> 00:28:08,605
Dive! Huh?

333
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:13,205
<i>Dad!</i>

334
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:16,285
Dad?

335
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:37,565
I'm gonna kill you,

336
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:42,205
your mama and all her
bridge-playin' friends.

337
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:47,365
You think you got it tough? I got a face-lift.
There was one just like it underneath.

338
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:50,165
Hmph? Hmph?

339
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:53,565
Aaah!

340
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:56,325
Aah! Aah-aah!

341
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:58,445
Aaah!

342
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,765
Aah!

343
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:08,925
<i>Dad? Dad?</i>

344
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:11,365
Hey, boys, we got
a closet case here.

345
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:28,885
Smell-o-gram.

346
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:38,765
<i>Sushi, anyone?
California roll coming up.</i>

347
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:42,085
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

348
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:44,645
All for one, and one for all!

349
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:47,205
Catch your pants
before they fall.

350
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,605
On the runway now, we have Dr. James
Harvey, wearing smashing underwear.

351
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:52,685
Marky Mark he's not!

352
00:29:58,445 --> 00:30:01,405
You are good.

353
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:04,365
Oh, stop. It's you.
Are we scary or what?

354
00:30:04,445 --> 00:30:07,685
Aiii-ya!

355
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:12,605
Oh, and it looks as if we're gonna
go into sudden death overtime.

356
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:19,125
Anybody for a little
shish ka-doc? I am!

357
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:21,365
Hah!

358
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:28,605
Yeow!

359
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:31,245
Ha-ha!

360
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:33,845
<i>En garde!
Ha, ha!</i>

361
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:35,805
Kitchie-koo!

362
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:45,165
Who do you think you are,
defiling our domicile, huh?

363
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:49,125
Dr. James... Harvey,
your... therapist.

364
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:53,125
Dad? Dad?

365
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:58,165
Are you okay?

366
00:31:02,805 --> 00:31:07,685
Dad?

367
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:10,125
Yaa!

368
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:20,805
<i>He's down for the count.</i>

369
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:24,365
<i>The winner...
by a clean stink-out!</i>

370
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:25,845
Ha!

371
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,845
Get back. What the hell is that thing?

372
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:34,765
- Ha, ha!

373
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:36,885
Not the nose!

374
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:40,485
I'm bein' hosed!

375
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:44,205
No, no, no, no, no!

376
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:47,605
Th-Th-This sucks!

377
00:31:47,685 --> 00:31:50,765
<i>Dad?</i>

378
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:53,685
Are you okay?

379
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:59,645
Oh, I'm fine. Why don't
we go, uh, regroup?

380
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:02,165
<i>Get your hand
out of my mouth!</i>

381
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:04,085
<i>Oh, man, who let one?
Well, who do you think?</i>

382
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:06,205
<i>Who's got their pointy head
in my... That's not my head.</i>

383
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:09,405
<i>You know, fellows, we're
never this close anymore.</i>

384
00:32:49,685 --> 00:32:51,805
Morning!

385
00:32:51,885 --> 00:32:54,565
Oh, no, please don't scream.
I- I promise I won't hurt you.

386
00:32:54,645 --> 00:32:57,965
I'm a ghost, yes, I admit it. But I'm
a friendly ghost. You have to trust me.

387
00:32:58,005 --> 00:33:02,405
If you scream, you'll wake up my
uncles, and they get awfully cranky.

388
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:04,485
I'm gonna
let you go now, okay?

389
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:08,725
You're so cold.

390
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:13,765
Yeah, but it saves
on the heating bill. Ha!

391
00:33:15,405 --> 00:33:17,565
<i>Come on.</i>

392
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:21,485
It's okay.

393
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,925
I can see
right through you.

394
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:28,045
Kind of happens
when you don't have any skin.

395
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:32,405
Wh... What are you made of?

396
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:36,485
Well, you know that tingling
feeling when your foot falls asleep?

397
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:40,925
I think
I'm made of that.

398
00:33:57,525 --> 00:34:01,005
Um, sunny-side up
kind of makes me yak.

399
00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:03,325
No problem.

400
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:24,325
So, can you go invisible?

401
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:27,805
Ha, ha.
That one's easy.

402
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:33,125
It's fresh.

403
00:34:37,485 --> 00:34:39,365
Go ahead.

404
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:43,645
I've never done this before. Me neither.

405
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:46,325
Can you hurt me?
N- No.

406
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:49,285
Can I hurt you?
No.

407
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:05,485
Cool.

408
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:13,325
Morning, Dr. Harvey.
Uh, some breakfast?

409
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,485
Uh, hmph. Uh...

410
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:20,885
Well, uh, yeah.

411
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:24,965
Honey? You okay?

412
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:26,925
Good.

413
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:35,725
<i>How about a paper? The New
York Times? The Journal?</i>

414
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:38,485
<i>Hong Kong Press?
Sure.</i>

415
00:35:38,565 --> 00:35:40,405
Comin' at ya.

416
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:51,885
Well...
Hope you're hungry.

417
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:11,765
# Da, da-da-da, da
Da, da-da-da, da #

418
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:18,365
I love the smell
of fleshies in the morning.

419
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:27,565
I'm melting!
I'm melting!

420
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:30,885
Auntie Phlegm!
Auntie Phlegm!

421
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:34,485
<i>Oh, what a world!</i>

422
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:38,365
What a world!

423
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:51,965
They're gone.
What happened?

424
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:54,485
They must have
crossed over.

425
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:03,645
Don't think so!
Guess again, bonebag!

426
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:06,725
Fellas, good morning.

427
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:10,565
Casper!

428
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,885
How dare you serve these
air-sucking intruders before us.

429
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:17,285
I was just...
Give me...

430
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:21,285
My meal!

431
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,165
Okay, okay.

432
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:29,005
Mmm!
Mmm!

433
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:31,685
Mmm!

434
00:37:31,765 --> 00:37:34,405
<i>I feel like Oprah
on hiatus.</i>

435
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:37,725
<i>You look like
Oprah on hiatus.</i>

436
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:40,965
Ketchup, please.

437
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:43,725
Yum, yum! Yum!

438
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:48,085
You know what the problem is?
Casper's got no respect for us.

439
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:51,045
After all we've done
for the little glowworm.

440
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:54,245
Yeah. What the hell do you
think you're doin', bulbhead?

441
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:57,805
<i>This floor used to be
dirty enough to eat off of.</i>

442
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:00,045
But we have company.
Oh, yeah?

443
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:03,205
Well, company loves misery.
Boom!

444
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:08,045
You guys are disgusting,
obnoxious creeps.

445
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,605
Thank you!

446
00:38:09,685 --> 00:38:12,125
What's your problem?
He's just cleaning the floor.

447
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:13,723
- Take a hike.
- Get a grave.

448
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,491
Honey! You've got the school
thing. - You don't wanna be late.

449
00:38:17,216 --> 00:38:18,256
<i>Drop dead!</i>

450
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,730
<i>- It's too late!
- You'll have a lot of fun.</i>

451
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,010
I know you will!

452
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,330
All right, guys.

453
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,970
We've obviously gotten off
on the wrong foot here.

454
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,450
Now, you know and I know
that you really shouldn't be here.

455
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,410
So I'll tell you what.

456
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,290
Why don't you go ahead
and finish your meal...

457
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:47,570
and we can meet in my office and
start the process of crossing over.

458
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,570
What do you say?

459
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,670
Well, it's your hour.

460
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,350
Watch it!

461
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,670
Hey, Amber!
Wait up!

462
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,470
<i>Hey, you guys.</i>

463
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,150
Whoa!
Whoa!

464
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:42,453
Had that locker
last year.

465
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:45,093
Thanks.

466
00:39:46,293 --> 00:39:48,173
My name's Vic.

467
00:39:48,213 --> 00:39:51,493
Kat.

468
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:56,293
Coming, Vic?

469
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,613
<i>Okay, gang, let's settle down.</i>

470
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,133
Put a lid on it!
Ow!

471
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:06,893
Okay, I've got a couple
of announcements to make.

472
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:09,293
First,

473
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:13,293
the asbestos removal from the
gym is taking longer than planned.

474
00:40:13,373 --> 00:40:18,413
We're gonna have to push back the
Halloween dance by a couple of months.

475
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:26,573
Well, as most of you know, my parents
have finished the new boathouse.

476
00:40:26,653 --> 00:40:29,413
So I'm sure it'd be no problem
having the party at my place.

477
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:32,733
<i>Great!</i>

478
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:36,733
That's done. Secondly,
we have a new student today.

479
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:39,933
I'd like you all to meet
Harvey Kathleen.

480
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:44,173
Would you like to come up
and say hi to everyone for me?

481
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:04,573
<i>So, why don't you tell us something
special about yourself, Kathleen?</i>

482
00:41:04,653 --> 00:41:06,733
Um, well, it's Kat.

483
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:12,613
And, um, I guess
I just moved here...

484
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:15,333
<i>with my dad
from Santa Fe.</i>

485
00:41:15,413 --> 00:41:19,653
And Friendship seems
like a pretty friendly place.

486
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,053
<i>So where are you guys living?</i>

487
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,973
<i>In outer space?</i>

488
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:30,413
No. Whipstaff?

489
00:41:33,973 --> 00:41:35,973
You've heard of it?

490
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:38,893
You actually live there?

491
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:43,493
<i>I know it looks kind of funky
and stuff from the outside.</i>

492
00:41:43,573 --> 00:41:48,333
But, I mean, I don't know...
Inside it's kind of cool.

493
00:41:48,413 --> 00:41:51,373
Well, yeah,
if you drink blood.

494
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:56,213
Mr. Curtis, check this. We're dead
for the Halloween dance, right?

495
00:41:56,293 --> 00:42:00,093
This girl has a seriously, seriously
creepy house with room to spare.

496
00:42:00,173 --> 00:42:05,293
I thought we were having
the party at my place.

497
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:07,573
Oh? Okay,
we'll take a vote.

498
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:11,813
Whoever wants the party
at my house, raise your hand.

499
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,893
<i>Whipstaff?
Yeah!</i>

500
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:19,893
Oh!

501
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:24,253
Johns Hopkins University?
Very impressive.

502
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,213
<i>Very. Pull!</i>

503
00:42:28,853 --> 00:42:31,773
<i>Pow!</i>

504
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:34,413
<i>Pull!</i>

505
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:38,093
Not... this one.
Thank you, gentlemen.

506
00:42:38,173 --> 00:42:41,253
Hey, what a dish, Doc!
The little missus perhaps?

507
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,693
Hubba, hubba!

508
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:46,733
Fatso, you animal.
She available, Doc?

509
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:50,613
She's my wife Amelia.
She's deceased. Even better.

510
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:53,893
But... we're not here
to talk about me.

511
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:57,613
See? Now don't you feel just
awful? I was just goofin'.

512
00:42:57,653 --> 00:43:01,893
Don't be goofin' on Amelia. She's
as nice a person as they come.

513
00:43:01,973 --> 00:43:05,013
<i>She's always treated you right,
huh, Stinkie?</i>

514
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:07,893
<i>I got no complaints. She's
always been an angel to me.</i>

515
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:11,133
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

516
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,293
<i>I'm sayin:
She's a peach.</i>

517
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:16,493
<i>None better. Why?
You've actually seen her?</i>

518
00:43:16,533 --> 00:43:19,453
You think I'm blind?
Of course I've seen her.

519
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:22,493
Who hasn't? You're not
lookin' for her, are ya, Doc?

520
00:43:22,573 --> 00:43:27,733
Well, that's not really the
focus of our sessions here, is it?

521
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,013
But as long as
you raised the issue,

522
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:33,493
you wouldn't have a way...

523
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:37,293
of contacting others
like yourselves, would you?

524
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:38,893
Hmm?

525
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:41,773
I didn't think so.

526
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:44,773
Now, that's not generally
allowed there, Doc.

527
00:43:44,853 --> 00:43:48,173
<i>Ya gotta go
through channels.</i>

528
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,213
Paperwork.
Red tape.

529
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:53,893
A holy mess, you know?
But for you?

530
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:57,413
I don't know. Maybe we
could work somethin' out.

531
00:43:57,493 --> 00:44:01,253
You keep that ghoul
Crittenden off our backs,

532
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:05,213
and I'd say we got
a deal, right, boys?

533
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:06,573
Mm-hmm!

534
00:44:06,613 --> 00:44:10,213
Deal?
Deal.

535
00:44:10,293 --> 00:44:13,613
Fatso, you know where Amelia floats. Go!

536
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:16,973
It's that easy, huh?

537
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:19,013
We got a ghost-to-ghost
network.

538
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:21,653
We share haunting stories.
We throw parties.

539
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:23,893
The parties are always
pretty dead, though.

540
00:44:27,438 --> 00:44:29,478
That was fast.

541
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:37,613
<i>I... I think
it's for you, Doc.</i>

542
00:44:45,173 --> 00:44:47,453
Go.

543
00:45:11,902 --> 00:45:13,742
Amelia?

544
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:18,022
My man!

545
00:45:25,582 --> 00:45:27,422
Vic?

546
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:31,382
What are you do...
I mean, hi.

547
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,622
Can I come in?

548
00:45:34,662 --> 00:45:36,782
Uh, no, no.

549
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:40,182
It's so much nicer
out here...

550
00:45:40,262 --> 00:45:43,182
in the flesh...
fresh air.

551
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:46,142
So did ya ask your dad
about the party?

552
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:50,942
Y- Yeah, yeah. He, um,
kind of hit the ceiling,

553
00:45:51,022 --> 00:45:53,342
but, um, I think
it's gonna be okay.

554
00:45:53,382 --> 00:45:58,462
Cool. So, listen, if you're
not hooked up with anybody else,

555
00:45:58,542 --> 00:46:02,422
you wanna... I don't know...
hang out with me at the party?

556
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:05,782
I'd love to.

557
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:09,502
All right, cool.
All right, see ya.

558
00:46:09,582 --> 00:46:10,942
Okay.

559
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:18,982
Yes!

560
00:46:24,262 --> 00:46:27,302
Well, did you ask her?
Yeah.

561
00:46:27,382 --> 00:46:30,462
And she actually
believed you?

562
00:46:30,502 --> 00:46:35,582
This really bites.
No, it's absolutely perfect.

563
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:44,222
Hey!

564
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:51,662
See? I'm a good dancer.
Whoa!

565
00:46:58,102 --> 00:47:00,782
Don't need a costume.

566
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:04,822
I'm always the life
of the party.

567
00:47:04,902 --> 00:47:07,942
Casper, listen.
I know you want to go.

568
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:09,942
Come on. We'd have
a great time together.

569
00:47:10,022 --> 00:47:12,062
Casper, I have a date.

570
00:47:12,142 --> 00:47:14,622
What's this Vic guy got
that I don't, huh?

571
00:47:14,702 --> 00:47:19,182
A pulse?
Big fleshy deal.

572
00:47:19,262 --> 00:47:22,102
A tan.
Very bad for your skin.

573
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:24,982
How about a reflection?

574
00:47:29,382 --> 00:47:33,022
Okay, okay,
but can he do this?

575
00:47:35,342 --> 00:47:38,742
Come with me if you want to live.

576
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,582
Casper?

577
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:43,502
Casper! No! Don't!

578
00:47:43,582 --> 00:47:47,742
Casper, no!
Casper, no! No, no, no, no!

579
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,702
Casper, no. Oh, my God!
High! This is very high!

580
00:47:54,782 --> 00:47:58,182
Casper! Casper!

581
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:11,982
Casper,
this is beautiful.

582
00:48:12,062 --> 00:48:14,422
I come here every night.

583
00:48:14,502 --> 00:48:18,542
Alone?
Mm-hmm.

584
00:48:18,622 --> 00:48:22,382
What were you like
when you were alive?

585
00:48:22,462 --> 00:48:27,182
I was... I was...

586
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:29,342
I don't remember.

587
00:48:30,662 --> 00:48:33,342
You don't remember
anything from your life?

588
00:48:33,422 --> 00:48:35,262
No.

589
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:38,022
So... Nothing?

590
00:48:38,102 --> 00:48:40,062
No.

591
00:48:40,142 --> 00:48:44,142
You don't remember what school
you went to, how old you were?

592
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:46,822
Your favorite song?

593
00:48:46,902 --> 00:48:52,302
What about your dad?
Hm-mmm.

594
00:48:52,382 --> 00:48:54,742
Not even your mom?

595
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:58,462
Is that bad?
No.

596
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:01,302
It's just kind of sad.

597
00:49:09,022 --> 00:49:12,222
I wonder why you
don't remember anything.

598
00:49:12,302 --> 00:49:17,502
Hmm? Guess 'cause
when you're a ghost,

599
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:20,702
life doesn't matter
that much anymore.

600
00:49:20,742 --> 00:49:23,902
So you forget.

601
00:49:23,942 --> 00:49:28,502
Sometimes I worry
that I'm trying to forget.

602
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:30,662
Forget what?

603
00:49:30,742 --> 00:49:35,102
My mom.
Just certain things.

604
00:49:36,262 --> 00:49:40,222
The sound of her making
breakfast downstairs.

605
00:49:40,302 --> 00:49:42,502
The way she put on
her lipstick...

606
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:45,822
so carefully.

607
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:51,622
I do remember...
she always used Ivory soap.

608
00:49:51,702 --> 00:49:54,782
And when she'd hug me,
I'd breathe her in...

609
00:49:54,822 --> 00:49:57,422
so deep.

610
00:49:57,502 --> 00:50:01,302
And I remember,
before I'd go to sleep,

611
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:05,662
she'd whisper in my ear,
"Stardust in the eyes,

612
00:50:05,742 --> 00:50:09,342
rosy cheeks and a happy girl
in the morning."

613
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:16,302
Casper?

614
00:50:17,662 --> 00:50:19,622
Hmm?

615
00:50:19,702 --> 00:50:24,302
If my mom's a ghost,
did she forget about me?

616
00:50:24,382 --> 00:50:27,702
No, she'd
never forget you.

617
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:32,502
Kat?
Mm-hmm?

618
00:50:32,582 --> 00:50:38,062
If I were alive, would you go to
the Halloween dance with me?

619
00:50:38,142 --> 00:50:40,142
Mm-hmm.

620
00:50:40,222 --> 00:50:42,782
Kat?
Hmm?

621
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:46,502
Can I keep you?
Mm-hmm.

622
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:53,662
Casper, close the window.
It's cold.

623
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:20,182
Hey, Dad!

624
00:51:20,262 --> 00:51:22,622
Found your Visa card.

625
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,782
Where was it?
Um, in your wallet.

626
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:28,542
Maybe I could use it to buy this perfect
costume I saw in a store downtown.

627
00:51:28,582 --> 00:51:33,062
You always made your
costume. No, Mom did.

628
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:36,902
I think I could come up
with something pretty good.

629
00:51:36,982 --> 00:51:41,302
Why don't we roll you in aluminum
foil, and you could go as a leftover?

630
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:47,862
Don't worry.
You always look cute.

631
00:51:47,902 --> 00:51:51,902
I don't wanna look cute. Cute's
like when you're nine years old...

632
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,302
and you've got papier-mache
around your head.

633
00:51:55,382 --> 00:52:00,542
I want to look... nice.
Mm-hmm.

634
00:52:00,582 --> 00:52:04,702
Like... Like date nice.

635
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:11,182
Really? Uh...

636
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:14,862
Honey, I think maybe
it's time that we...

637
00:52:14,942 --> 00:52:17,982
<i>sat down and... It's a
little late for that, Dad.</i>

638
00:52:18,022 --> 00:52:23,582
- How late?
- Oh, don't worry. Not that late.

639
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:26,902
Oh, good.

640
00:52:26,982 --> 00:52:30,702
You know that I would love
to buy you everything you wanted.

641
00:52:30,782 --> 00:52:34,702
But until Miss Crittenden pays
me, that thing is pretty worthless.

642
00:52:34,782 --> 00:52:38,582
Oh, well, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

643
00:52:38,662 --> 00:52:41,582
I'm sure I can come up with
something perfect for the party.

644
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:45,102
<i># It's my party and
I'll die if I want to #</i>

646
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:52,222
Dad, please,
whatever you do,

647
00:52:52,262 --> 00:52:54,262
don't let those guys
crash it.

648
00:52:54,342 --> 00:52:59,622
Oh, no, I think they're actually
getting to be quite focused now.

649
00:53:02,022 --> 00:53:05,502
<i># You will die too

651
00:53:08,742 --> 00:53:11,702
<i>Big finish!</i>

652
00:53:11,782 --> 00:53:13,782
<i>Scream or sugar?</i>

653
00:54:28,902 --> 00:54:33,022
<i>Vell, vell, ze patient
has finally arrived.</i>

654
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:35,062
Late again, I see.

655
00:54:35,142 --> 00:54:38,142
Could this be an expression
of hostility, Doc?

656
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:43,102
<i>It's your hour, Freud.</i>

657
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:49,342
What? So silent? No pearls
of wisdom today, Doc?

658
00:54:49,382 --> 00:54:53,702
Come on, Doc.
Stay tough. Don't stop.

659
00:54:53,782 --> 00:54:56,342
Come on, Doc.
Hang with us homeboys.

660
00:54:56,422 --> 00:54:59,142
Hey, wait a second.
What?

661
00:54:59,222 --> 00:55:02,102
You ain't thinkin' about
packin' it in now, are ya, Doc?

662
00:55:02,182 --> 00:55:03,742
We were just startin'
to have fun.

663
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:09,182
It ain't often we meet
a bonebag as amusin' as you.

664
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:13,982
Boys, this is serious. I think the doc
is havin' one of them fleshy breakdowns.

665
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:15,142
<i>Time for drastic measures.</i>

666
00:55:15,182 --> 00:55:17,862
Think we should break into a song? No!

667
00:55:17,902 --> 00:55:21,342
It's time we gave the doc
our own prescription.

668
00:55:21,422 --> 00:55:24,422
What about the party?
The party will have to wait.

669
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:27,662
Are you thinkin' what
I'm thinkin'? Gentlemen?

670
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:30,462
Happy hour! Happy hour! Happy hour.

671
00:55:30,502 --> 00:55:32,702
Whoop...
Yee-haw!

672
00:55:32,782 --> 00:55:34,742
<i># Ninety-nine bottles of beer
on the wall #</i>

673
00:55:34,822 --> 00:55:38,462
<i># Ninety-nine bottles of beer #
Just the dead guys!</i>

674
00:55:38,542 --> 00:55:40,982
This is an outrage.
This is appalling.

675
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:43,982
You pay a man to get the ghosts out
of the house, and what does he do?

676
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:46,902
He gets the ghosts out
of the house. Exactly.

677
00:55:59,102 --> 00:56:00,942
It's about time.

678
00:56:09,902 --> 00:56:12,022
Ohh!
Look familiar?

679
00:56:13,982 --> 00:56:15,822
This is...

680
00:56:16,862 --> 00:56:18,702
This is...

681
00:56:21,022 --> 00:56:22,862
And...

682
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:27,182
I know this.

683
00:56:31,942 --> 00:56:34,342
I had five fingers.

684
00:56:34,422 --> 00:56:36,262
I remember!

685
00:56:36,342 --> 00:56:38,382
Hootie!

686
00:56:42,862 --> 00:56:44,702
<i>Chugga-chugga,
chugga-chugga.</i>

687
00:56:44,782 --> 00:56:46,622
And wait!

688
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:55,582
Check it out.

689
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,502
<i>Hands up, Kat.</i>

690
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,782
Oh, wow.
It was my mom's.

691
00:57:11,422 --> 00:57:13,502
Can I...
Go ahead.

692
00:57:24,622 --> 00:57:27,862
Oh, Casper,
it's perfect.

693
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,942
You think I could wear it
to the party tonight?

694
00:57:32,422 --> 00:57:34,262
Casper?

695
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:43,262
I begged and begged my dad
to get me this sled,

696
00:57:43,342 --> 00:57:45,942
and he acted like
I couldn't even have it,

697
00:57:45,982 --> 00:57:48,702
'cause I didn't know
how to ride it.

698
00:57:48,742 --> 00:57:51,422
And then one morning, I...
I came down for breakfast,

699
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:53,782
and there it was,
just for me.

700
00:57:53,822 --> 00:57:55,782
For no reason at all.

701
00:57:57,062 --> 00:58:01,182
I took it out,
went sledding all day,

702
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:03,902
and my dad said, "That's
enough," but I couldn't stop.

703
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,942
I was having so much fun.

704
00:58:06,022 --> 00:58:07,862
Then it got late.

705
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,742
It got dark.

706
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:12,662
Got cold.

707
00:58:14,022 --> 00:58:17,662
And I got sick.
My dad got sad.

708
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:27,262
What's it like to die?

709
00:58:28,982 --> 00:58:31,542
Like being born.

710
00:58:32,782 --> 00:58:35,302
Only backwards.

711
00:58:35,382 --> 00:58:39,062
I remember I didn't go
where I was supposed to go.

712
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:41,622
I just stayed behind...

713
00:58:41,662 --> 00:58:43,822
so my dad
wouldn't be lonely.

714
00:58:58,062 --> 00:59:00,022
<i>Is that your dad?
Mm-hmm.</i>

715
00:59:03,102 --> 00:59:06,902
"McFadden claimed that he was
haunted by the ghost of his dead son,

716
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:10,102
"and that he invented a machine
to bring him back to life:

717
00:59:10,182 --> 00:59:12,022
The Lazarus."
The Lazarus.

718
00:59:17,862 --> 00:59:20,382
Ooh.

719
00:59:20,462 --> 00:59:24,382
Hee-hee. Sorry. I guess we'll
have to take the long way.

720
00:59:24,462 --> 00:59:26,342
Hurry up!
Come on!

721
00:59:29,982 --> 00:59:32,902
My dad hid it so no one can find
it, but I remember where it is!

722
00:59:32,982 --> 00:59:34,942
<i>Ha!
Wait'll you see it.</i>

723
00:59:45,422 --> 00:59:48,142
- Don't you know a shortcut?
- You got it.

724
00:59:49,662 --> 00:59:53,062
Casper, no!
Wall... human?

725
00:59:53,142 --> 00:59:55,022
Stop!

726
01:00:00,742 --> 01:00:03,782
<i>Hey! Over here.</i>

727
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:05,702
Go ahead.
Sit down.

728
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:11,142
I would hold on.
Why?

729
01:00:24,302 --> 01:00:29,222
Casper!

730
01:01:55,742 --> 01:01:57,582
Well?

731
01:01:57,662 --> 01:02:00,222
What was that?
The "Up and At 'Em" machine.

732
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:04,222
My dad was a great inventor, but he had a
little trouble getting going in the morning.

733
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,462
Didn't he ever hear
of caffeine?

734
01:02:12,702 --> 01:02:15,702
- Dibs!

735
01:02:15,742 --> 01:02:19,702
Wha...

736
01:02:26,182 --> 01:02:28,582
What is all this?

737
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,142
My dad's lab. Kind of a slob, wasn't he?

738
01:02:31,222 --> 01:02:34,742
Down here, he could do whatever he
wanted to. But no matter how busy he was,

739
01:02:34,782 --> 01:02:37,662
he would drop everything
to play pirates with me.

740
01:02:37,742 --> 01:02:40,062
<i>Man, we had
so much fun.</i>

741
01:02:40,102 --> 01:02:44,582
Aye, matey. Buccaneers and buried
gold. Whipstaff doth a treasure hold.

742
01:02:44,662 --> 01:02:46,542
Oh!
Come on.

743
01:02:48,542 --> 01:02:50,382
Dibs!
Oh!

744
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:54,062
<i>So where's this Lazarus
thing? You're lookin'at it.</i>

745
01:02:54,142 --> 01:02:57,822
Down there?
Huh. That's useful.

746
01:02:57,862 --> 01:03:01,022
Oh, I know there's a way to
get it going. I just can't...

747
01:03:01,062 --> 01:03:03,902
- What about that?
- That?

748
01:03:03,982 --> 01:03:06,062
Nah. That's the vault.

749
01:03:08,782 --> 01:03:11,222
Wait!
It's gotta be this!

750
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,982
Hey, I did it!

751
01:04:36,222 --> 01:04:38,102
Lazarus!

752
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:47,542
Ah. Ooh. Ouch.

753
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,742
- What is this?
- Careful!

754
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,102
That's what makes
the whole thing work.

755
01:05:11,142 --> 01:05:13,742
Kind of an instant
primordial soup mix.

756
01:05:14,782 --> 01:05:17,182
It's what brings ghosts
back to life.

757
01:05:18,462 --> 01:05:20,382
Just enough for one.

758
01:05:33,982 --> 01:05:36,062
- Pull the lever.
- Which one?

759
01:05:36,142 --> 01:05:37,982
I don't know.
Try one.

760
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:52,662
- Casper?
- I'm gonna be alive.

761
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:04,422
Oh, man, how am I
gonna do this?

762
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,302
I couldn't even get
my Easy Bake oven to work.

763
01:06:14,502 --> 01:06:16,382
Okay.

764
01:06:44,382 --> 01:06:46,222
Casper?

765
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,462
Am I alive?

766
01:07:04,222 --> 01:07:07,062
Dibs, do you have any
idea what this means? Yes!

767
01:07:08,382 --> 01:07:11,982
No. You don't have to be
scared of death anymore.

768
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:14,422
One minute you'll be a ghost;
next, you're back on your feet,

769
01:07:14,462 --> 01:07:16,782
free to come and go
as you please.

770
01:07:16,862 --> 01:07:19,782
Hell, you could even
fly through... Walls.

771
01:07:21,702 --> 01:07:24,342
Thick walls.
Thick as steel.

772
01:07:25,662 --> 01:07:28,062
Certainly could get to
whatever's behind those walls.

773
01:07:28,142 --> 01:07:31,382
Like a, a treasure, for
example? And snap, crackle, pop:

774
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:34,942
You're back alive and on
your way to the Riviera.

775
01:07:35,022 --> 01:07:37,822
If you were a ghost.

776
01:07:37,902 --> 01:07:40,422
If you were.

777
01:07:42,422 --> 01:07:45,742
<i>Damn it, Dibs.
This won't hurt a bit.</i>

778
01:07:45,822 --> 01:07:50,102
<i>Stop being such a weenie!
It's just business. Come on!</i>

779
01:07:50,182 --> 01:07:52,742
- If you would just...

780
01:07:52,822 --> 01:07:56,662
Whoa.
Wa-a-a-a!

781
01:08:06,265 --> 01:08:08,145
<i>So there you are.</i>

782
01:08:21,505 --> 01:08:24,745
Dibs, you're takin' this
way too personally.

783
01:08:42,905 --> 01:08:45,465
Carrigan!

784
01:08:47,425 --> 01:08:49,865
Are you
a ghost yet?

785
01:08:51,185 --> 01:08:53,425
Carrigan!

786
01:08:56,385 --> 01:08:58,905
What a tragic waste.

787
01:08:58,985 --> 01:09:00,945
She had my favorite sunglasses.

788
01:09:03,545 --> 01:09:06,265
<i>Not so fast, little man.</i>

789
01:09:15,225 --> 01:09:18,065
# Warden threw a party
at the county jail #

790
01:09:18,145 --> 01:09:20,745
# The prison band was there
They began to wail #

791
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:23,745
<i># The band played hard
The joint began to swing #</i>

792
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:25,905
# You should've heard those
knocked-out jailbirds sing #

793
01:09:25,945 --> 01:09:27,825
# Let's rock #

794
01:09:27,865 --> 01:09:31,425
Hey, this Dr. Harvey's got a lot
of spirit, you know what I'm sayin'?

795
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:34,865
Yeah, but he's got his whole
miserable life ahead of him.

796
01:09:34,945 --> 01:09:38,505
So we could do him a favor
and put him out of his misery.

797
01:09:38,585 --> 01:09:40,705
Yeah. Hey,
good idea.

798
01:09:40,785 --> 01:09:43,745
We been the ghostly trio
long enough.

799
01:09:43,825 --> 01:09:47,625
Time to make it a...
quartet!

800
01:09:58,905 --> 01:10:01,585
Could I just
say something here?

801
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:05,345
- And get a little personal?
- Oh, yeah. You know how it is. Okay.

802
01:10:05,425 --> 01:10:08,665
Well, I just
got to tell you...

803
01:10:10,265 --> 01:10:14,745
you guys remind me of what it's
like to hang out with the boys.

804
01:10:14,825 --> 01:10:19,865
I mean, you are absolutely
there for each other.

805
01:10:19,905 --> 01:10:22,625
<i># Falling in love... #</i>

806
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:25,185
I mean, you look life
right in the face.

807
01:10:25,265 --> 01:10:28,505
You say, "I'm a ghost.
I don't need you. Mmm."

808
01:10:28,585 --> 01:10:32,385
You know what? I'm gonna
tell that Miss Critten Picken...

809
01:10:33,305 --> 01:10:36,745
Uh, Crichton Critten...
Crut...

810
01:10:36,825 --> 01:10:41,505
I'm gonna tell that lady
you aren't goin' anywhere.

811
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:44,665
It's your house.
You're haunting it.

812
01:10:44,705 --> 01:10:46,945
Possession is
nine-tenths of the law.

813
01:10:47,025 --> 01:10:48,865
No. No. No. Yes.

814
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:50,945
No. No. No. Yes.

815
01:10:51,025 --> 01:10:55,225
Aww. Aww. I didn't
think so at first, but...

816
01:10:55,265 --> 01:10:57,145
you guys are great.

817
01:10:58,705 --> 01:11:00,665
I love you... guys.

818
01:11:00,745 --> 01:11:04,145
Hey. Hey!

819
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:06,185
Eeow!

820
01:11:06,265 --> 01:11:09,505
Eeeeee!
Ohh!

821
01:11:09,585 --> 01:11:11,625
Hey.
Noooo.

822
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:16,385
Heh-heh.

823
01:11:16,465 --> 01:11:18,305
Oof!

824
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:25,265
What a sweetheart.

825
01:11:25,345 --> 01:11:28,865
I can't croak him now.

826
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:31,185
Me neither.
No way.

827
01:11:34,585 --> 01:11:36,945
All right, boys!

828
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:39,185
The night is young.
Mm-hmm.

829
01:11:39,225 --> 01:11:43,865
We are gonna clean out
every bar this town has got.

830
01:11:43,945 --> 01:11:45,665
Uh-uh-uh.

831
01:11:45,745 --> 01:11:48,105
We're gonna booze it
until we lose it.

832
01:11:48,185 --> 01:11:50,025
Come on.
Come on.

833
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:53,425
<i>Whoop.</i>

834
01:12:03,305 --> 01:12:05,145
Think my ears
just popped.

835
01:12:10,825 --> 01:12:12,665
<i>Come to Mama.</i>

836
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:19,625
<i>- My treasure!
- You mean my treasure.</i>

837
01:12:19,705 --> 01:12:22,745
Uhhh.
Miss Crittenden?

838
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:25,545
In the flesh.
Well, in a couple of minutes.

839
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:29,065
<i>- Oh! Ah! Oh!</i>

840
01:12:30,865 --> 01:12:34,225
Dibs! What are you doing?
This is no time to shave.

841
01:12:34,265 --> 01:12:37,185
Helping you, remember?
Remember what?

842
01:12:37,265 --> 01:12:39,105
This!

843
01:12:39,185 --> 01:12:42,745
You stole that.
That's Casper's.

844
01:12:42,785 --> 01:12:45,825
So sue me. Dibs!
The capsule! Now!

845
01:12:45,905 --> 01:12:48,305
Coming.
I'm coming, okay?

846
01:12:53,025 --> 01:12:57,065
<i>Keep away from me.</i>

847
01:13:01,145 --> 01:13:03,505
Here. Jump in.

848
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:25,625
Oh!

849
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:27,545
- Oy.
- Perfect.

850
01:13:32,185 --> 01:13:36,185
- We're here.
- Uh, okay.

851
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:38,945
Hi. Come on in.
This is the room.

852
01:13:39,025 --> 01:13:42,385
Um, stay together; you'll be
safe. And I'll be right back.

853
01:13:49,305 --> 01:13:51,425
Amber, do we
have to do this?

854
01:13:51,505 --> 01:13:56,385
Hey, she wants a Halloween party,
she's gonna get a Halloween party.

855
01:14:10,225 --> 01:14:12,785
Hey, that's my treasure! Stay back!

856
01:14:12,825 --> 01:14:14,745
- Keep away from me.
- Casper!

857
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:18,945
Don't come near me, you spiteful spook,
or I'll knock you into the next world.

858
01:14:19,025 --> 01:14:21,785
Come on.
Let's go.

859
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:32,705
# Ta-da #

860
01:14:32,785 --> 01:14:35,665
<i>Hey, "poppin' fresh,"
it's my turn in the oven.</i>

861
01:14:35,745 --> 01:14:39,905
Dibs! Get this thing cooking,
you blasted little worm you!

862
01:14:41,705 --> 01:14:46,185
Ah... Carrigan.
How kind of you to drop in.

863
01:14:46,265 --> 01:14:48,425
<i>You know,</i>

864
01:14:48,505 --> 01:14:50,905
if there's one thing I've
learned from you, it's:

865
01:14:50,985 --> 01:14:52,945
Always kick 'em
when they're down.

866
01:14:53,025 --> 01:14:58,225
And, baby, you're six feet
under. Oh, what a shame.

867
01:15:00,385 --> 01:15:02,985
Sorry, sweetheart.
We're through.

868
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:07,065
I am not gonna forget this, you
ungrateful, lousy little worm you.

869
01:15:07,105 --> 01:15:10,545
Oh, you can haunt me
all you want,

870
01:15:10,585 --> 01:15:14,065
but it's gonna be in a
great big, expensive house...

871
01:15:14,145 --> 01:15:16,465
with lovely
purple wallpaper...

872
01:15:16,505 --> 01:15:19,145
and great big
green carpets...

873
01:15:19,225 --> 01:15:21,565
and a little dog
called Carrigan...

874
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:23,425
just like you.

875
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:26,379
I got the power.
I got the treasure.

876
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:29,683
And you have
a flight to catch.

877
01:15:33,203 --> 01:15:35,403
Any other takers?

878
01:15:35,443 --> 01:15:38,603
No. But aren't you
forgetting something?

879
01:15:38,643 --> 01:15:40,763
What?

880
01:15:40,843 --> 01:15:42,683
Your unfinished
business.

881
01:15:42,763 --> 01:15:45,803
- My what?
- You know,

882
01:15:45,883 --> 01:15:47,763
unfinished business.

883
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:52,163
All ghosts have unfinished business.
That's why they don't cross over.

884
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:55,883
Unfinished business?
I have no unfinished business.

885
01:15:55,963 --> 01:16:00,003
I have my treasure, my mansion.
I have everything.

886
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:03,083
I'm just perfect.

887
01:16:04,123 --> 01:16:06,683
<i>Wait! Wait!
I lied.</i>

888
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:09,283
I have unfinished business,
lots of unfinished business.

889
01:16:09,363 --> 01:16:11,883
I- I'm not ready
to cross over yet.

890
01:16:11,963 --> 01:16:14,763
Wait! You tricked me,
you rotten little brats!

891
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:40,163
My treasure! A ball?
That's your treasure?

892
01:16:40,243 --> 01:16:45,003
Are you kidding? It's autographed
by Duke Snyder, the Brooklyn Dodgers.

893
01:16:45,043 --> 01:16:47,323
My favorite player.

894
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:49,963
Casper, it's time.

895
01:16:56,443 --> 01:16:59,483
<i>Honey!
I'm home!</i>

896
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:02,843
Whoooaaa-ehhhh-whoo-ohhh!

897
01:17:04,163 --> 01:17:07,043
Ooh.
Dad?

898
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:09,803
No! What have you
done to him?

899
01:17:09,843 --> 01:17:13,163
Nothin'. He's just
a little... dead.

900
01:17:13,243 --> 01:17:15,803
I'm free! I've never
felt so good in my life.

901
01:17:15,883 --> 01:17:19,283
I can fly-y-y-eee!

902
01:17:19,363 --> 01:17:21,803
Rookie. Stinkie, work with him.

903
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:24,963
Dad?
Yeah.

904
01:17:25,003 --> 01:17:28,243
Hey! Who's the girl? Dad, it's me.

905
01:17:28,323 --> 01:17:32,043
I- It's Kat.
Kat. Kat?

906
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:34,283
- Kat Ballou.
- Katatonic.

907
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:37,003
Katastrophic.
Kreplach soup.

908
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:43,083
<i>Ohh.</i>

909
01:17:43,123 --> 01:17:47,043
- Flesh flood alert.
- Dad?

910
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:48,963
Don't you remember?

911
01:17:51,243 --> 01:17:54,203
Oh, yeah!
I remember!

912
01:17:55,443 --> 01:17:57,403
No!

913
01:17:57,483 --> 01:18:01,283
<i>No. No!
This.</i>

914
01:18:03,043 --> 01:18:04,883
Oh.

915
01:18:05,963 --> 01:18:07,803
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

916
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:11,163
Oh, Kat!

917
01:18:11,243 --> 01:18:14,363
Oh, sweetheart.

918
01:18:14,443 --> 01:18:17,963
Oh, what have I done?
I... Oh, Kat.

919
01:18:18,043 --> 01:18:21,443
Don't cry. I...
Oh, please.

920
01:18:22,723 --> 01:18:25,643
Come on, Dr. Harvey. You
need this more than I do.

921
01:18:29,243 --> 01:18:31,403
Casper.

922
01:18:31,443 --> 01:18:34,123
This is the way
it's gotta be.

923
01:19:01,643 --> 01:19:04,363
Dad?
Oh, Kat!

924
01:19:04,403 --> 01:19:07,083
Oh! Ohh, Kat.

925
01:19:07,123 --> 01:19:09,803
Aww. Hey.

926
01:19:12,163 --> 01:19:14,763
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

927
01:19:14,843 --> 01:19:17,963
Oh, that felt like
the strangest dream.

928
01:19:20,403 --> 01:19:24,803
I... I thought we almost lost
each other for a minute there.

929
01:19:28,843 --> 01:19:31,523
Oh, Bucket.

930
01:19:37,163 --> 01:19:39,283
Your party started
without you.

931
01:19:42,123 --> 01:19:45,003
Your date's
probably waiting.

932
01:19:45,043 --> 01:19:47,883
Maybe we should
get going.

933
01:19:50,763 --> 01:19:55,083
Uh...
where are we?

934
01:20:12,523 --> 01:20:15,123
Well, go ahead.
What about you?

935
01:20:15,203 --> 01:20:19,043
Hey, this is your party.
Go do your thing.

936
01:20:19,123 --> 01:20:24,203
Go hang. Or chill or kick
it or whatever you call it.

937
01:20:26,403 --> 01:20:28,843
I think you got
a date out there.

938
01:20:28,923 --> 01:20:31,243
Thanks, Dad.

939
01:20:35,683 --> 01:20:37,963
I hope no one saw that.

940
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:49,483
Hold still! I'm trying.
Could you weigh any more?

941
01:20:49,563 --> 01:20:51,723
Just shut up and
get your head down.

942
01:20:53,003 --> 01:20:57,443
Oh, my... Oh,
you gotta see this.

943
01:20:57,483 --> 01:20:59,803
People are gonna freak.

944
01:20:59,883 --> 01:21:01,723
Let me see.

945
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:05,323
Cool.

946
01:21:05,363 --> 01:21:08,043
Thank you.

947
01:21:25,003 --> 01:21:26,963
Yeah!

948
01:22:16,323 --> 01:22:18,163
You're...
Uh-huh.

949
01:22:19,603 --> 01:22:21,803
You're...
That's right.

950
01:22:23,723 --> 01:22:25,923
Kat's mom?

951
01:22:25,963 --> 01:22:27,843
Are... Are you
an angel?

952
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:32,683
That was a very noble thing
you did tonight, Casper.

953
01:22:32,763 --> 01:22:37,323
I know Kat will never forget
it. She needs her father.

954
01:22:37,403 --> 01:22:40,683
And I know yours
will never forget it either.

955
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:43,363
You fulfilled
his greatest dream, Casper,

956
01:22:43,403 --> 01:22:46,483
and I know he is
very, very proud of you.

957
01:22:46,563 --> 01:22:51,043
And for what you've done, I'm
giving you your dream in return.

958
01:22:52,163 --> 01:22:54,843
<i>But it's just for tonight.</i>

959
01:22:55,843 --> 01:22:57,723
Sort of a Cinderella deal.

960
01:22:57,803 --> 01:23:00,883
- So I have until midnight?
- 10:00.

961
01:23:00,963 --> 01:23:03,523
Hey, Cinderella
got until midnight.

962
01:23:04,523 --> 01:23:07,123
Cinderella wasn't 12 years old.

I was a good dancer.

01:24:56,523 --> 01:24:58,403
Can I keep you?

984
01:25:02,443 --> 01:25:05,763
Casper?

985
01:25:44,483 --> 01:25:46,563
Hello, James.

986
01:25:50,043 --> 01:25:52,123
Amelia.

987
01:25:52,203 --> 01:25:54,923
It's all right.

988
01:25:56,843 --> 01:25:58,683
It's just me.

989
01:25:59,843 --> 01:26:01,683
I...

990
01:26:04,203 --> 01:26:07,123
I thought I'd have a hundred
things to say when I...

991
01:26:10,283 --> 01:26:12,123
How?

992
01:26:12,203 --> 01:26:16,243
Let's just say you know three
crazy ghosts who kept their word.

993
01:26:18,443 --> 01:26:21,803
James, I know you've
been searching for me.

994
01:26:21,883 --> 01:26:25,083
But there's something
you have to understand.

995
01:26:25,163 --> 01:26:27,963
You and Kat loved me
so well when I was alive...

996
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:30,643
that I have no
unfinished business.

997
01:26:30,723 --> 01:26:32,723
Please don't
let me be yours.

998
01:26:32,803 --> 01:26:34,643
But, Amelia,

999
01:26:37,603 --> 01:26:40,003
I don't...

1000
01:26:40,043 --> 01:26:42,763
I don't really know
what I'm doing.

1001
01:26:44,003 --> 01:26:46,003
What parent does?

1002
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:50,323
James, Kat is growing up
beautifully because of you.

1003
01:26:52,283 --> 01:26:55,403
No wonder
I miss you so much.

1004
01:26:56,843 --> 01:26:59,083
Just a couple things,
though.

1005
01:26:59,163 --> 01:27:03,283
Don't pick up the extension
every time she gets a phone call.

1006
01:27:03,363 --> 01:27:06,363
French fries
are not a breakfast food.

1007
01:27:06,443 --> 01:27:08,763
And don't ask her
to wear a T-shirt...

1008
01:27:08,843 --> 01:27:11,963
under her...
Ah, under her bathing suit.

1009
01:27:12,043 --> 01:27:15,203
I know.
Our daughter is...

1010
01:27:15,243 --> 01:27:17,123
A teenager.
A teenager.

1011
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:45,363
Wait.

1012
01:27:45,443 --> 01:27:47,843
Where are you going?

1013
01:27:47,883 --> 01:27:50,003
Where I can watch over
both of you...

1014
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:52,043
until we're
together again.

1015
01:27:56,243 --> 01:27:58,923
- Good-bye, James.

1016
01:28:18,843 --> 01:28:20,683
Casper?

1017
01:28:37,803 --> 01:28:39,683
Uh, ha. Boo?

1018
01:28:59,283 --> 01:29:01,763
Not bad for
my first party, huh?

1019
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:03,883
Couldn't have
been better.

1020
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:06,883
It ain't over yet.
