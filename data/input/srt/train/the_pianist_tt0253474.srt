1
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

2
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,560
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

3
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,480
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,080
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

5
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,081
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,761
Jurek, where have you been
hiding her?

7
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:21,401
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

8
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:25,561
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:28,641
What do you think, should I take
uncle Szymon's portrait?

10
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:31,841
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

11
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:34,321
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

12
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,201
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

13
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:40,242
- I should have another case.
- Mama, Wladek is home!

14
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:44,562
Thank God.
Wladek! You're wounded?

15
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:47,762
- No, it was nothing.
- I've been worried sick.

16
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:50,402
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

17
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:52,362
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd know where to take you.

18
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:57,442
Henryk, don't say things like that.
God forbid. God forbid.

19
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:59,562
- Papa, Wladek is home.
- What did I tell you?

20
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:03,082
- What are you doing?
- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

21
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:07,763
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.
- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

22
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:09,763
Pack, darling.
Get your things packed.

23
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,923
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw.

24
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:14,603
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

25
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,363
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

26
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,923
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

27
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:22,523
- She used it for packing.
- The government has moved to Lublin.

28
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:26,963
All men must leave the city, go across
the river, set up a new line of defense.

29
00:03:27,203 --> 00:03:30,924
There isn't anybody left here, only
the women. The men are all gone.

30
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:33,684
What do you think you'll do while
they set up a new line of defense?

31
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:37,004
- Wonder around with your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

32
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:40,844
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

33
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:43,564
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

34
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:47,004
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to
die in my own home, staying put.

35
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:50,884
- God forbid.
- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

36
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:55,084
...from the BBC in London.
The British government...

37
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:59,485
having received no reply
to the observations presented...

38
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:01,845
to the German government...

39
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:05,805
has declared war on nazi Germany.

40
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:09,605
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

41
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:19,325
...within the next few hours, France
will make a similar declaration.

42
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:22,725
Poland is no longer alone.

43
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,886
Wonderful, wonderful!

44
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:35,286
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- It certainly was.

45
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,886
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

46
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:40,926
Here's to Great Britain and France!

47
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,726
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

48
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,768
Five thousand and three.

49
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:23,848
- Is that all?
- Yes. It's all we've got left.

50
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:27,088
- It's 3,003 too much.
- Look.

51
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:30,568
"Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

52
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:33,848
Jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

53
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:38,328
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

54
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:42,128
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

55
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:46,769
We could hide the money. Look here.
We can hide it under the flowerpots.

56
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:49,929
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

57
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,409
You know what we did
in the last war?

58
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,329
We made a hole in the table leg,
and hid the money in there.

59
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,929
- Suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean?

60
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:03,529
Germans go into Jewish homes and
take furniture, valuables, anything.

61
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,409
- Do they?
- Why'd they want a table like this?

62
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:10,449
- What on earth are you doing?
- Listen. Look.

63
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,610
This is the best place. No-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot.

64
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,810
- No, listen. I've been thinking...
- Really? That's a change.

65
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,170
- You know what? We use psychology.
- We use what?

66
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,090
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, covered. In full view.

67
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,610
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will never notice it.

68
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,570
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

69
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,011
Look here.

70
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,051
Idiot.

71
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,931
- And you call me stupid.
- Very good. That's the last place...

72
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:45,171
- This would take hours.
- We're not in a hurry.

73
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:48,451
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me.

74
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:51,571
- How will you get them out?
- Quiet! Order, please!

75
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:54,371
- You reach them out individually.
- No-one listens to me!

76
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:57,251
Quiet, please, quiet.
Order, order, please.

77
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:01,571
- The lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look.

78
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:05,172
The watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin.

79
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:11,572
- But I'll still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

80
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:15,412
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

81
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:17,572
We're fine, thank you.
And you?

82
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:22,772
Fine, under the circumstances.
I guess I know why you're calling.

83
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,972
There's nothing we can do.
They won't reopen the station.

84
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:31,773
- Yes, I know, but I...
- No music, no radio for the Polish.

85
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:35,133
But sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you.

86
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,653
Maybe, maybe not, but...

87
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:42,773
don't be offended, but I didn't call
to discuss my future carrier.

88
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:46,053
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

89
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:49,253
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
so I came and...

90
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:51,773
they bombed the station.

91
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:55,293
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.
- Really?

92
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:58,814
Yes, it was unforgettable.

93
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:02,494
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.

94
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:05,814
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope it's a compliment.

95
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:09,534
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

96
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:13,814
- Should we go and have a coffee?
- I'd like that.

97
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:18,934
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

98
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:21,974
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

99
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:24,615
- What instrument?
- The cello.

100
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:27,335
I love to see women
playing the cello.

101
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,575
JEWS FORBIDDEN

102
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:34,855
This is disgraceful.
How dare they?

103
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,815
You know what people are like, they
want to be better nazis than Hitler.

104
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,695
- I'm going in there to complain.
- It's better not, believe me.

105
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:45,095
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye.

106
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:51,616
We'll find somewhere else.

107
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:54,976
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

108
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:58,336
Official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

109
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:01,536
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

110
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:06,456
We could sit in a bench, but
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

111
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,376
This is absurd.

112
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:14,256
We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that.

113
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:19,577
So, you play the cello. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer?

114
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:22,057
Chopin? Really? Well...

115
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:25,017
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

116
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:27,297
What about you, Wladek?

117
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,337
Perhaps I could accompany.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

118
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:34,697
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

119
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:38,777
Call me Wladek, please.

120
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:42,537
"Free emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

121
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:45,538
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

122
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:48,858
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

123
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:53,698
This decree will come into force
on the first of December, 1939...

124
00:09:53,898 --> 00:09:57,178
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

125
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:00,578
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

126
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,378
and will represent the blue star
of David on a white background.

127
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:07,978
The background must be
sufficiently large...

128
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:11,779
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

129
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:16,259
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

130
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:21,619
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

Governor of the Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer. "

132
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,579
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

133
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,420
Let me see this.

134
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,180
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

135
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,980
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them.

136
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,420
You!

137
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,541
Come here.

138
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,501
Why haven't you greeted us?

139
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:16,421
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:29,221
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

141
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:31,422
Go to the gutter.

142
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:50,902
- Have you seen this?
- What? What? I'm working. What?

143
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:54,102
What is this?

144
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:58,823
- It's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean "put us"?

145
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:04,663
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

concerning the establishment of
the Jewish district in Warsaw.

00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:18,503
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area...

149
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:23,824
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31 of October, 1940."

150
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,104
They won't get all of us.
It's too small.

151
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,224
There's 400 thousand of us
in Warsaw.

152
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:32,784
No, 360 thousand.
So it will be easy.

153
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:36,744
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me.

154
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:42,064
Mama?

155
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:45,184
Mama, what is it?

156
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,624
20 zlotys!

157
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:52,905
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

158
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:59,425
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

159
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:03,905
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

160
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:14,145
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

161
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:16,945
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

162
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:20,906
- But it's a Bechstein!
- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

163
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,986
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

164
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,826
- Get out!
- What's the matter with you?

165
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:28,906
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

166
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:32,146
Haven't you eaten today?
What are you suffering from?

167
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,866
You people are crazy.

168
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:38,946
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

169
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:41,586
I'm not even charging
for the removal!

170
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,907
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy.

171
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:46,907
Take it.

172
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:21,628
Hello.

173
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,948
Hello. Hi.

174
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:29,188
I didn't want to come.

175
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:33,828
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

176
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:35,868
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

177
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:37,989
Good.

178
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:41,709
No, not really.
They arrested my cousin.

179
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:44,149
Jurek says they'll let him out.

180
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:49,749
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

181
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:52,789
That's what I said myself.

182
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,589
It's too absurd.

183
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:02,429
I... I should go.

184
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,070
Well, I'll see you...

185
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,950
soon.

186
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,470
Good-bye.

187
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,111
Well...

188
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:35,191
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

189
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:45,431
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

190
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:48,511
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

191
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:51,911
Look.

192
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:55,311
Come and look.

193
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:28,113
Go away.

194
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:30,473
Go away! Go away!

195
00:16:31,513 --> 00:16:34,593
Papa! Papa!

196
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,114
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

197
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:55,834
- 3 zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

198
00:16:55,954 --> 00:17:00,114
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

199
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:02,874
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

200
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:06,314
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

201
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:11,154
They bring cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

202
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:13,034
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

203
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:16,914
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

204
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:21,155
A tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard.

205
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:25,675
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

206
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:29,435
Sleep well. But if you see him,
write to me, yes?

207
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:31,555
Izaak Szerman.

208
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:49,076
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

209
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,356
Why can't they go around?

210
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:55,116
Don't worry. They're about to build
a bridge. Haven't you heard?

211
00:17:55,956 --> 00:17:57,916
A bridge! Those idiots.

212
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:01,516
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

213
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:05,076
But do you know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.

214
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:08,196
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here...

215
00:18:08,356 --> 00:18:10,557
waiting for them to let us through.

216
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,877
Maybe they think I come here
to listen to the music?

217
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:19,037
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

218
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:23,317
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

219
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:26,157
- Dance!
- Dance!

220
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:29,157
Come on, come on! Dance!

221
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:34,037
Very well.

222
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:36,117
What about you?
Dance with him.

223
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:41,598
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

224
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:46,958
Come on. And you.

225
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,438
Go on.

226
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:56,878
Faster!

227
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:00,558
Come on!

228
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:03,158
Faster!

229
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,519
Come on!

230
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,919
Faster!

231
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,519
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

232
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,599
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

233
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,280
Good, they're here.

234
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,760
Itzak Heller has been
waiting for you.

235
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,200
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

236
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,760
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

237
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,641
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

238
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:10,241
His father is back in the jewellery
business. He's doing well.

239
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,961
Amazing, jewellery.

240
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,481
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

241
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:20,041
Don't be clever with me.
I'm coming as a friend.

242
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:22,361
They're bringing Jews in
from all over the country.

243
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,522
Soon there will be half million people
in the ghetto.

244
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:28,522
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

245
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:32,042
You want me to beat up Jews
and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

246
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:34,682
- Someone has got to do it.
- But why me?

247
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:37,202
I thought you only recruited boys
with rich fathers.

248
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,322
Look at my father, look at us...

249
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:42,522
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm
here. You can have a better life.

250
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:46,002
- You want to survive selling books?
- Yes, please.

251
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,402
I'm doing you people a favor.

252
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:52,243
What about you?
You're a great pianist.

253
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,803
We've got a police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.

254
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,043
- Join us. You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

255
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:47,205
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

256
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:51,925
Who wants me to stop?

257
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:42,887
I always say,
look on the bright side.

258
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:46,367
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

259
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:49,967
You're better off than us. Here in
the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

260
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:53,167
- You have to give me something.
- You're an artist...

261
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:55,327
you keep peoples' spirits up.
You do enough.

262
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:58,887
- I want to help, do something.
- You're too well known.

263
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:03,808
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

264
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:08,008
You're too... too musical.

265
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:14,688
- Who is that?
- Symche.

266
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:16,928
Majorek.

267
00:23:17,968 --> 00:23:21,008
There are notices going up. City is
to be cleansed of the undesirables.

268
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:24,088
- There's always notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

269
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:28,288
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

270
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:31,929
Jehuda, working hard?

271
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:35,929
This is the greatest pianist in
Poland. Maybe the whole world.

272
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:38,929
Wladyslaw Szpilman,
meet Majorek.

273
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:40,929
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

274
00:23:41,969 --> 00:23:44,489
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

275
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:49,449
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

276
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:54,049
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

277
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:57,850
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

278
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,970
Five hundred.

279
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,290
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

280
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,930
That makes 10 thousand readers.
This will start the uprising.

281
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,250
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

282
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,210
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

283
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,850
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

284
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,930
They're too clean for them.

285
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:27,371
Please, mister, please.

286
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,612
Hold it!
You little bastard!

287
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:02,412
Take this!

288
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:04,532
Stop it! Stop it!

289
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:06,452
Stop it!

290
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,132
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.

291
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:21,733
Stand up! Stand up.

292
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:54,934
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

293
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:58,534
- Enjoy your meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

294
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:01,654
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon.

295
00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:06,454
The Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

296
00:26:06,654 --> 00:26:09,694
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

297
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:13,215
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so...

298
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:15,695
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

299
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:18,095
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

300
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:22,655
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja
and everybody else who was there.

301
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:27,255
Isn't that a laugh?

302
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:31,255
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

303
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,135
I said nothing bad.

304
00:26:33,815 --> 00:26:37,376
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

305
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,136
It's not funny.

306
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:43,656
You know what's funny? You're
funny, with that ridiculous tie.

307
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:47,856
What are you talking about? What's
my tie have to do with anything?

308
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:50,216
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

309
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:54,496
- That's right, I work.
- Playing the piano for the parasites.

310
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,736
- Parasites...
- Boys. Boys!

311
00:26:57,936 --> 00:27:00,416
- They don't give a damn.
- And you blame me for their apathy?

312
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:03,977
I see it everyday. They don't even
notice what's going around them.

313
00:27:04,177 --> 00:27:06,057
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

314
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:09,297
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

315
00:27:10,257 --> 00:27:13,377
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying.

316
00:27:13,617 --> 00:27:15,777
Haven't got a bite to eat.

317
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:21,097
The Jewish bankers should persuade
America to declare war on Germany.

318
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:39,378
The lights! The lights!

319
00:27:56,538 --> 00:28:00,659
Turn on the lights.

320
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:05,819
Come on!

321
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:12,779
Open the door!
We want to go in!

322
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:16,419
Open the door!

323
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,660
Stand up!

324
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,220
You, stand up! Come on!

325
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,260
Throw him out!

326
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:55,021
Mama...

327
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:10,181
Come on, run!

328
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:18,504
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Go in. Not you.

329
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,505
- What?
- Come. It's terrible.

330
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:42,705
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

331
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:45,065
They've taken Henryk.

332
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:49,505
Go home, alright? Go home,
I'll take care of it.

333
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:04,266
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

334
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:08,186
- I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

335
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:11,946
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

336
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,226
What happened here?

337
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:26,986
They've got my grandson. They
pick them up and take them away.

338
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:30,747
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

339
00:31:31,627 --> 00:31:34,307
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:31:35,387 --> 00:31:37,107
Itzak?

341
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:39,147
Itzak?

342
00:31:39,387 --> 00:31:42,707
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

343
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:51,147
- Henryk is in there.
- I haven't seen him.

344
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:53,427
Believe me.
They picked him up.

345
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:01,428
- Can you help?
- Now you need me. Now you need me!

346
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,748
Can you help us?

347
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:07,028
- It costs.
- I have no money.

348
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:09,708
Then there's nothing I can do.
You should have joined us.

349
00:32:09,868 --> 00:32:14,108
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

350
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,748
People I know. They said
you're an important man.

351
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:22,668
Itzak...

352
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:40,749
- Hands up.
- How are you?

353
00:32:40,949 --> 00:32:44,469
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

354
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:46,789
Dead! Dead!

355
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:50,070
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

356
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,270
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

357
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,630
Thank you.

358
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,110
Everything is alright!

359
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,350
He looks very happy.

360
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,270
Everything is alright.

361
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,750
Everything is alright.

362
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,750
Hands up! Hands up!

363
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,550
It's alright.

364
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,351
Help! Help!

365
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:23,071
Let go! Help!

366
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:17,473
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Itzak Heller?

367
00:34:17,673 --> 00:34:21,113
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

368
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:26,033
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?
- I asked him to help you.

369
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:28,793
What did you pay him?

370
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:34,033
With what could I pay him? Every
zloty I earn we spend on food.

371
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:37,114
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

372
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:41,074
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

373
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:44,514
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

374
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:48,634
- You're mad. That's your trouble.
- That's also my business.

375
00:34:57,474 --> 00:35:00,714
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

376
00:35:01,674 --> 00:35:04,035
Hungry.

377
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:15,075
Employment certificate. What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

378
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:18,035
You have to have an
employment certificate...

379
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:20,675
to work for the Germans
in the ghetto, otherwise...

380
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:23,635
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

381
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:26,995
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

382
00:35:27,915 --> 00:35:30,916
and send us to labor camps,
in the East.

383
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,636
- They're closing the small ghetto.
- Oh, God!

384
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,156
Wladek? Wladek?

385
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:56,917
I thought you were on tour playing
in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

386
00:35:57,117 --> 00:35:59,757
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

387
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,797
Have you heard the rumors? They're
going to resettle us in the East.

388
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:06,997
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart. What's the trouble?

389
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:11,437
I've been trying to get the certificate
of employment for my father.

390
00:36:11,597 --> 00:36:14,877
I managed to get one for me and my
family, but I need one for my father.

391
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:18,157
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

392
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:20,397
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

393
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,957
I'm not, but Majorek is.

394
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:27,118
Can you help?
I have no money.

395
00:36:27,278 --> 00:36:30,558
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

396
00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:33,038
Be at the Schultz workshop
tomorrow, four o'clock.

397
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,878
See what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

398
00:36:36,078 --> 00:36:39,798
That's the historical imperative in
action! That's why I always say:

399
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:42,318
- "Look on the bright side!"
- Yes, I know.

400
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:57,359
- How's your back?
- Better.

401
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,479
Better?

402
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,559
Better not ask.

403
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,040
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

404
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,600
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

405
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,602
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

406
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,843
At least we are still together.

407
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:53,883
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

408
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:56,323
Move, move!

409
00:38:56,923 --> 00:39:01,123
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

410
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:06,804
Wait.

411
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:08,484
Here.

412
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:11,764
Go over there. Hurry.

413
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:13,884
You.

414
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:16,844
You. You.

415
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,244
You.

416
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:23,724
You.

417
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:27,204
You.

418
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:38,925
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

419
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:42,205
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

420
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:45,245
Where are you taking us?

421
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,446
I'm sorry, I did my best.

422
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:15,606
- I thought the certificates'd save us.
- Stop it, Wladek.

423
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:19,206
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

424
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:47,887
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

425
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:51,288
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

426
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:59,528
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

427
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:05,368
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

428
00:41:06,648 --> 00:41:10,008
Why did I do it?

429
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,050
Don't you have a bottle of water?
He's dying.

430
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,130
My child is dying of thirst.

431
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,130
- I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

432
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,010
- Don't you have water? I beg you.
- Can you hear what I'm saying?

433
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,450
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

434
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,890
Letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter.

435
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,130
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

436
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,331
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

437
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,131
At least we can die honorably, not
as a stain on the face of History.

438
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:17,931
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

439
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:20,651
You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

440
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:24,691
- They're going to wipe us all out.
- What do you want me to do? Fight?

441
00:42:24,931 --> 00:42:27,451
To fight, we need organization,
plans, guns.

442
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:30,131
He's right. Do you think I'm going
to fight with my violin bowl?

443
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:33,091
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

444
00:42:33,611 --> 00:42:35,611
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

445
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:37,092
Sure.

446
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:41,532
Look at that cripple, the old people,
the children. They're going to work?

447
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:45,332
Look at you. You're going to carry
logs on your back?

448
00:43:25,573 --> 00:43:28,813
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

449
00:43:38,294 --> 00:43:42,574
I missed you.
I wanted to be with you!

450
00:43:51,014 --> 00:43:53,454
I wanted to be with you!

451
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:55,614
Stupid. Stupid.

452
00:43:56,014 --> 00:44:00,055
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

453
00:44:00,215 --> 00:44:03,415
She's getting on my nerves.

454
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:11,975
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

455
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:17,335
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

456
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,295
The baby cried
just as the police came.

457
00:44:20,495 --> 00:44:24,496
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

458
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:29,296
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

459
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:55,657
What are you reading?

460
00:44:57,977 --> 00:45:02,657
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

461
00:45:02,777 --> 00:45:04,977
If you poison us, do we not die?

462
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:08,137
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

463
00:45:15,457 --> 00:45:18,858
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

464
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:39,458
Idiot. What does he think
he's gonna do with the money?

465
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:43,098
Boy, come here.

466
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:45,579
Come here.

467
00:45:46,819 --> 00:45:48,779
- How much for a caramel?
- 20 zlotys.

468
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:52,299
For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

469
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,699
20 zlotys.

470
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:58,259
We've got 20 between us.

471
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:00,939
I've got 10, I think.

472
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:06,219
5, 10, 20.

473
00:47:25,582 --> 00:47:28,302
- Halina?
- What?

474
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:33,383
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

475
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:37,743
I wish I knew you better.

476
00:47:40,343 --> 00:47:42,343
Thank you.

477
00:47:58,064 --> 00:47:59,704
Szpilman?

478
00:48:08,944 --> 00:48:11,304
Papa? Papa?

479
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:15,944
Mama? Halina?

480
00:48:16,464 --> 00:48:18,984
Halina? Mama?

481
00:48:19,584 --> 00:48:24,345
What do you think you're doing?
I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

482
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:30,025
Don't run!

483
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:33,545
Anna!

484
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:36,025
Anna!

485
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:57,906
Off they go to the melting pot.

486
00:49:00,866 --> 00:49:05,386
- This stays.
- Give it to me!

487
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,946
What are you doing?
She's pregnant.

488
00:51:33,952 --> 00:51:35,832
Wladek?

489
00:51:53,232 --> 00:51:56,232
Why are you here, Wladek?

490
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:59,033
It's like this, I...

491
00:52:00,633 --> 00:52:02,473
We...

492
00:52:04,673 --> 00:52:07,473
All of them, all of them.

493
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:09,793
All of them.

494
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:14,673
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

495
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:17,873
It's not finished yet. We'll stay
here for a couple of days...

496
00:52:18,073 --> 00:52:20,033
until things die down.

497
00:52:20,193 --> 00:52:23,594
I've bribed the policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

498
00:52:25,714 --> 00:52:29,274
Attention!
On the march!

499
00:52:38,874 --> 00:52:40,754
Onward!

500
00:52:43,074 --> 00:52:46,074
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

501
00:52:46,274 --> 00:52:49,154
Don't get overexcited.

502
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:07,515
It's gold.
Very good price.

503
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:29,636
Someone you know?

504
00:53:29,756 --> 00:53:31,716
A beauty.
Who is she?

505
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:35,796
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband is an actor.

506
00:53:35,996 --> 00:53:38,356
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

507
00:53:38,556 --> 00:53:42,276
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

508
00:54:07,997 --> 00:54:10,318
Turn left!

509
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:12,838
On the march!

510
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:19,558
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

511
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:29,398
At ease.

512
00:54:33,318 --> 00:54:35,958
Turn right!

513
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,479
Step forward.

514
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:47,479
You.

515
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,119
You. You.

516
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,599
You.

517
00:54:58,399 --> 00:55:00,359
Down on the ground!

518
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:03,560
Down on the ground!

519
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:31,801
Turn left!

520
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:35,241
On the march.

521
00:56:13,642 --> 00:56:15,842
How long have you been here?

522
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:18,802
Since last night.

523
00:56:19,002 --> 00:56:21,322
I was pleased to see you.

524
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:28,323
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

525
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:32,323
We know what it means.

526
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:37,123
We sent someone out.
Zygmund, a good man.

527
00:56:39,523 --> 00:56:42,843
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

528
00:56:44,163 --> 00:56:46,283
He got to Sokolow.

529
00:56:46,443 --> 00:56:51,044
A man told him the tracks divided,
one branch's leading to Treblinka.

530
00:56:52,684 --> 00:56:56,444
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

531
00:56:56,644 --> 00:57:00,444
branch off to Treblinka
and return empty.

532
00:57:00,644 --> 00:57:03,524
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

533
00:57:04,364 --> 00:57:07,644
The civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

534
00:57:11,484 --> 00:57:13,724
They're exterminating us.

535
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:19,925
It won't take them long.

536
00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:24,725
We are 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

537
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:27,965
Mostly young people.

538
00:57:29,165 --> 00:57:32,085
And this time we're gonna fight.

539
00:57:33,805 --> 00:57:36,485
We're in good shape.

540
00:57:36,685 --> 00:57:40,445
Organized.
We're prepared.

541
00:57:40,645 --> 00:57:43,406
If you need help, I...

542
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:05,286
You! Come here!

543
00:58:06,246 --> 00:58:08,006
Shit!

544
00:58:15,727 --> 00:58:17,967
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

545
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:21,487
I don't know what I was thinking.

546
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:34,607
Take this! Take this!

547
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:51,408
Take him away.

548
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:09,889
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

549
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:14,009
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

550
00:59:14,129 --> 00:59:16,969
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

551
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,410
Trouble.

552
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:43,050
Round up only the Jews!

553
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:46,090
Round up!
Only the Jews.

554
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,610
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

555
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:59,451
I have good news for you.

556
00:59:59,611 --> 01:00:04,371
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

557
01:00:04,531 --> 01:00:07,331
to resettle you.

558
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:14,051
I promise you that now
and in the future...

559
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:17,691
nothing else is planned.

560
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:24,732
For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

561
01:00:26,012 --> 01:00:29,212
To show you our goodwill...

562
01:00:29,332 --> 01:00:33,172
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

563
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:36,292
to go in town daily...

564
01:00:36,692 --> 01:00:42,612
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

565
01:00:42,812 --> 01:00:47,092
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

566
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:52,493
So, why should we do something
like this if we'd resettle you?

567
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:58,813
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

568
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:05,733
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Making money?

569
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:10,653
Dismiss them.

570
01:01:26,334 --> 01:01:30,134
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

571
01:02:36,016 --> 01:02:37,137
Now!

572
01:03:13,178 --> 01:03:15,058
Majorek.

573
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:19,538
I have a favor to ask.

574
01:03:20,178 --> 01:03:22,458
I want to get out of here.

575
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:29,338
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll
survive on the other side that's hard.

576
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:31,739
I know.

577
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:36,259
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

578
01:03:36,419 --> 01:03:39,819
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

579
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:43,339
A singer, her husband
is an actor.

580
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:48,739
I've filled their names down and
their address, if they're still there.

581
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:53,659
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. They're good people.

582
01:03:54,619 --> 01:03:57,420
Would you try to make contact?

583
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,980
You go to town everyday. Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here.

584
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,181
Have you got any plaster?

585
01:04:47,141 --> 01:04:50,342
What are you up to?

586
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:54,302
What have you got there?

587
01:04:54,502 --> 01:04:58,302
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

588
01:04:58,502 --> 01:05:01,182
Three kilos of potato and bread.

589
01:05:01,382 --> 01:05:03,422
Open it.

590
01:05:06,982 --> 01:05:11,822
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

591
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,222
Open it.

592
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,184
Potatoes!

593
01:05:47,664 --> 01:05:50,544
You Jews are all alike.

594
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:54,304
We reach you with a finger...

595
01:05:54,504 --> 01:05:57,384
and you take the whole hand.

596
01:06:10,185 --> 01:06:14,385
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

597
01:06:37,346 --> 01:06:39,546
I've tried your friends.

598
01:06:39,706 --> 01:06:42,986
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

599
01:06:43,506 --> 01:06:45,546
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

600
01:06:45,786 --> 01:06:47,626
- Soon.
- Halt!

601
01:06:49,226 --> 01:06:51,066
Shit! Shit!

602
01:06:51,226 --> 01:06:53,786
Wait. What's going on here?

603
01:06:53,986 --> 01:06:57,506
Take this! Take this!

604
01:07:03,547 --> 01:07:07,387
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

605
01:07:11,547 --> 01:07:13,867
Do you know why
you're being hit?

606
01:07:14,027 --> 01:07:17,067
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

607
01:07:17,227 --> 01:07:21,627
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.

608
01:07:23,787 --> 01:07:25,987
On the march!

609
01:07:26,307 --> 01:07:28,667
March and sing!

610
01:07:29,107 --> 01:07:30,748
Sing something nice!

611
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:34,308
Loud and clear!

612
01:07:35,148 --> 01:07:38,948
Reunite tonight
And follow the white eagle

613
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:43,148
Stand up and fight
Our mortal enemies

614
01:07:43,308 --> 01:07:47,028
Rise on the day
Let's give them fire and brimstone

615
01:07:47,148 --> 01:07:51,028
We'll do away
The Yoke of slavery

616
01:07:51,148 --> 01:07:54,828
Punish and rout
The rapists of our nation

617
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:58,989
We'll slash them out
To save our dignity

618
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:33,230
Come.

619
01:09:44,673 --> 01:09:46,313
I'm sorry.

620
01:09:46,553 --> 01:09:49,153
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

621
01:10:13,194 --> 01:10:16,034
We haven't much time.
Come on.

622
01:10:23,394 --> 01:10:25,194
We must hurry.

623
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,594
Here. See if this fit.

624
01:10:27,794 --> 01:10:31,754
We have to keep moving you. Germans
are hunting down indiscriminately.

625
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:35,074
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

626
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:39,035
You better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

627
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:56,155
You'll be looked after
by Gebczynski.

628
01:10:56,355 --> 01:10:58,355
He's on the other side of town.

629
01:10:58,435 --> 01:11:02,195
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

630
01:11:02,635 --> 01:11:06,876
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

631
01:11:44,597 --> 01:11:47,397
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

632
01:12:16,558 --> 01:12:19,398
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

633
01:12:19,598 --> 01:12:24,319
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

634
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:33,719
It's not going to be very comfortable.

635
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:36,119
I'll be fine.

636
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,759
Thank you.

637
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,120
Here. Here. Give it to me.

638
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,560
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

639
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:28,841
DO NOT PASS

640
01:13:58,922 --> 01:14:01,322
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

641
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:10,203
But you leave them open
during the day. Don't forget.

642
01:14:13,043 --> 01:14:16,283
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, eh?

643
01:14:16,523 --> 01:14:17,963
Yes.

644
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:23,563
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

645
01:14:25,363 --> 01:14:28,883
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

646
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:32,363
I'll come again.
Janina will visit you twice a week.

647
01:14:32,483 --> 01:14:34,923
To bring more food,
see how you are.

648
01:14:35,243 --> 01:14:37,324
Thank you.

649
01:14:39,484 --> 01:14:42,644
This is very important.
In case of emergency...

650
01:14:42,804 --> 01:14:46,964
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

651
01:15:27,725 --> 01:15:29,846
What do you mean you forgot?

652
01:15:30,046 --> 01:15:32,886
What do you think I mean?
I forgot, that's what I mean.

653
01:15:33,046 --> 01:15:38,406
- You know, you treat me like dirt.
- Because you are a dirt.

654
01:15:38,606 --> 01:15:40,966
- Pig! Pig!
- Bitch!

655
01:15:41,126 --> 01:15:43,846
- Dirty pig!
- You are a dirty pig!

656
01:15:44,046 --> 01:15:46,646
Takes one to know one. Pig.

657
01:15:50,566 --> 01:15:55,166
- You play like an angel.
- Then why don't you listen?

658
01:15:55,326 --> 01:15:57,487
- I'm listening.
- Liar.

659
01:15:57,687 --> 01:16:00,887
You fell asleep. Pig.

660
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:25,248
Spread out!
We're being attacked!

661
01:16:27,648 --> 01:16:29,968
Take cover!

662
01:16:31,568 --> 01:16:32,528
Shoot!

663
01:16:44,088 --> 01:16:46,848
Take cover! Fire!

664
01:16:50,849 --> 01:16:53,569
Come on, get out!

665
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,732
The attack was successful.

666
01:18:21,652 --> 01:18:23,812
That building...

667
01:18:31,252 --> 01:18:33,212
Turn that way!

668
01:18:39,693 --> 01:18:41,533
Shoot!

669
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:06,654
Thank you.

670
01:19:09,694 --> 01:19:12,774
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, thank you.

671
01:19:16,694 --> 01:19:20,374
No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

672
01:19:20,494 --> 01:19:22,974
I never should've come out. I should
have stayed and fought with them.

673
01:19:23,174 --> 01:19:26,494
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

674
01:19:26,614 --> 01:19:29,415
Just be proud of them.

675
01:19:29,615 --> 01:19:33,055
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

676
01:19:34,975 --> 01:19:37,735
- So did the Germans.
- They are in shock!

677
01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:43,415
They didn't expect it. Nobody
expected it. Jews fighting back.

678
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:48,255
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

679
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:50,375
What good?

680
01:19:50,575 --> 01:19:52,895
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

681
01:19:53,015 --> 01:19:57,696
They died with dignity.
And you know something else?

682
01:19:58,536 --> 01:20:02,576
Now the Poles will rise.
We are ready.

683
01:20:02,776 --> 01:20:06,016
We'll fight too.
You'll see.

684
01:20:19,696 --> 01:20:22,256
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

685
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:24,977
What? What's happened?

686
01:20:27,257 --> 01:20:29,497
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

687
01:20:29,697 --> 01:20:33,657
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

688
01:20:34,457 --> 01:20:38,177
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

689
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,737
Where do you want me to go?

690
01:20:40,897 --> 01:20:44,297
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

691
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:48,537
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

692
01:20:48,737 --> 01:20:51,378
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window...

693
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:53,378
don't let them get you alive.

694
01:20:53,538 --> 01:20:56,658
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

695
01:24:04,705 --> 01:24:06,945
Open up!

696
01:24:09,465 --> 01:24:13,625
Open the door
or we'll call the police!

697
01:24:40,426 --> 01:24:44,306
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

698
01:24:44,506 --> 01:24:47,626
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just
came to visit, but I missed him.

699
01:24:47,786 --> 01:24:50,147
Have you got your identity card?

700
01:24:50,787 --> 01:24:53,627
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

701
01:24:56,187 --> 01:24:58,587
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

702
01:24:58,787 --> 01:25:01,347
He's a Jew! A Jew!

703
01:25:01,547 --> 01:25:03,307
Stop the Jew!

704
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:06,907
Don't let him out!
Stop him!

705
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:21,270
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

706
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:31,070
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

707
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,230
Come in.

708
01:26:40,911 --> 01:26:42,471
I'm sorry.

709
01:26:42,671 --> 01:26:46,031
I was given this address and
I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

710
01:26:46,231 --> 01:26:49,751
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

711
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:51,591
Come in.

712
01:26:59,191 --> 01:27:01,151
Sit.

713
01:27:03,992 --> 01:27:06,232
I need help.

714
01:27:07,992 --> 01:27:10,792
He'll be back before curfew.

715
01:27:10,912 --> 01:27:13,432
I've been in hiding.

716
01:27:14,592 --> 01:27:17,952
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

717
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:23,072
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

718
01:27:25,792 --> 01:27:28,312
And how is Jurek?

719
01:27:28,472 --> 01:27:30,113
Dead.

720
01:27:36,553 --> 01:27:40,193
- When is your baby due?
- Christmas.

721
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:44,513
This is not a good time to
have children, but then...

722
01:27:46,673 --> 01:27:49,953
This is my husband.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.

723
01:27:50,153 --> 01:27:54,793
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Yes, I remember.

724
01:27:56,554 --> 01:27:59,154
He said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

725
01:27:59,354 --> 01:28:01,194
Don't worry now.

726
01:28:09,754 --> 01:28:13,834
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

727
01:28:18,314 --> 01:28:20,074
Excuse me.

728
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:26,755
I'm sorry,
could I have a piece of bread?

729
01:28:26,955 --> 01:28:29,595
Yes, of course.
We will eat.

730
01:28:30,235 --> 01:28:33,755
Sit. Please, sit.

731
01:28:33,955 --> 01:28:35,635
Thank you.

732
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,520
You're on a very German area.

733
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:45,960
On the opposite is a hospital taking
wounded from the Russian front.

734
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,960
And next door is the
Schutzpolizei.

735
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,520
Safest place to be.

736
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:57,520
Right at the heart
of the lion's den.

737
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,561
I'll be locking you in.

738
01:31:04,721 --> 01:31:08,561
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

739
01:33:12,845 --> 01:33:14,725
All well?

740
01:33:15,245 --> 01:33:17,486
Thank you.

741
01:33:21,526 --> 01:33:25,206
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

742
01:33:25,326 --> 01:33:27,126
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

743
01:33:27,286 --> 01:33:29,006
Thank you.

744
01:33:29,246 --> 01:33:34,006
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring food, see that you're alright.

745
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:37,006
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

746
01:33:40,966 --> 01:33:44,967
- You don't remember me?
- I don't think so.

747
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:48,567
Warsaw Radio.
I was a technician.

748
01:33:49,127 --> 01:33:52,167
I saw you almost everyday.

749
01:33:52,687 --> 01:33:56,007
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- It doesn't matter.

750
01:33:58,207 --> 01:34:01,767
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

751
01:34:02,527 --> 01:34:05,247
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

752
01:34:05,367 --> 01:34:07,367
night after night,
after night.

753
01:34:07,567 --> 01:34:09,968
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

754
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:13,328
And the Russians are giving them
hell. It's the beginning of the end.

755
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:15,088
Let's hope so.

756
01:34:25,488 --> 01:34:27,608
Come here.

757
01:34:27,768 --> 01:34:29,888
Be careful with it.

758
01:34:30,808 --> 01:34:33,648
That's it. Be careful.

759
01:34:59,289 --> 01:35:02,009
Still alive then?

760
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:09,210
Here. Sausage, bread.

761
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:11,570
You still got that vodka?

762
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:29,131
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

763
01:35:29,611 --> 01:35:32,651
I think I've got jaundice.

764
01:35:32,891 --> 01:35:36,571
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

765
01:35:37,571 --> 01:35:41,491
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

766
01:35:41,691 --> 01:35:43,491
Drink up.

767
01:35:44,331 --> 01:35:47,211
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks...

768
01:35:47,411 --> 01:35:49,171
Problems.

769
01:35:49,331 --> 01:35:51,371
Money.

770
01:35:51,771 --> 01:35:54,251
I've got to raise money
to buy the food.

771
01:35:54,451 --> 01:35:58,172
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

772
01:36:01,932 --> 01:36:04,492
Here. Sell this.

773
01:36:06,732 --> 01:36:08,852
Food is more important than time.

774
01:36:13,852 --> 01:36:16,852
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

775
01:36:17,052 --> 01:36:19,252
Russians will be here soon.

776
01:36:19,692 --> 01:36:22,533
They'll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

777
01:36:23,373 --> 01:36:25,333
any day now.

778
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:09,374
Wladek?

779
01:37:18,295 --> 01:37:21,255
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

780
01:37:23,415 --> 01:37:25,655
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

781
01:37:25,815 --> 01:37:29,375
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

782
01:37:29,495 --> 01:37:31,855
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

783
01:37:32,055 --> 01:37:35,135
You stay. I'll go.

784
01:38:06,936 --> 01:38:09,657
We came to say goodbye.

785
01:38:09,817 --> 01:38:12,737
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

786
01:38:12,937 --> 01:38:16,097
The baby is already there.
It's safer.

787
01:38:16,297 --> 01:38:20,257
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

788
01:38:21,457 --> 01:38:24,337
That man Szalas should be shot.

789
01:38:24,897 --> 01:38:28,897
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

790
01:38:29,657 --> 01:38:34,497
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

791
01:38:38,618 --> 01:38:41,378
My God.

792
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:49,538
The liver the size of a football.
Inflammation of the gall bladder...

793
01:38:50,178 --> 01:38:52,538
but he'll leave.

794
01:38:54,498 --> 01:38:58,538
I'll try to get him some laevulose,
but it's not easy.

795
01:38:58,738 --> 01:39:02,258
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

796
01:39:02,459 --> 01:39:06,419
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

797
01:39:09,859 --> 01:39:12,299
Thank you so much for coming.

798
01:39:13,899 --> 01:39:16,019
We've brought you some food.

799
01:39:16,259 --> 01:39:19,939
I'll prepare something now
for you, then we must go.

800
01:39:59,821 --> 01:40:02,061
I'll throw a grenade!

801
01:40:09,941 --> 01:40:12,421
There's a wounded man over there!

802
01:40:12,901 --> 01:40:15,301
Come.

803
01:40:15,461 --> 01:40:17,781
Watch out! Watch out!

804
01:40:18,821 --> 01:40:21,661
- I'll go get help!
- Hurry!

805
01:40:22,301 --> 01:40:26,182
Come on! Bring the litter!

806
01:40:29,822 --> 01:40:32,342
Go back inside!

807
01:42:16,986 --> 01:42:19,546
Get out, get out in the streets!

808
01:42:19,746 --> 01:42:23,346
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

809
01:43:02,748 --> 01:43:06,908
Somebody...
Somebody help me!

810
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:05,430
Are you alright?
There's too much dust.

811
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:10,190
I'll check this side.
Don't worry.

812
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:12,750
Be careful!

813
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:20,550
- Heinrich?
- I'm checking!

814
01:44:22,991 --> 01:44:25,391
Is there anybody here?

815
01:44:29,311 --> 01:44:33,311
- Come on down!
- Alright, I'm coming.

816
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,080
Come on, pile them up.

817
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:41,280
Throw it.

818
01:50:02,083 --> 01:50:04,923
We have to mark everything.

819
01:50:05,963 --> 01:50:06,883
Come on.

820
01:56:50,859 --> 01:56:53,139
What are you doing here?

821
01:56:57,419 --> 01:56:59,659
Who are you?

822
01:57:03,579 --> 01:57:07,019
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

823
01:57:09,059 --> 01:57:11,219
What are you doing?

824
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:18,700
I was...

825
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:21,780
trying to open this can.

826
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:24,980
Do you live here?

827
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:29,180
Do you work here?

828
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:30,980
No.

829
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:36,940
What do you do for a living?

830
01:57:39,820 --> 01:57:41,580
I am...

831
01:57:43,101 --> 01:57:46,021
I was a pianist.

832
01:57:47,981 --> 01:57:50,141
Pianist?

833
01:58:08,141 --> 01:58:10,062
Come.

834
01:58:34,022 --> 01:58:36,183
Play something.

835
02:03:42,274 --> 02:03:44,994
Are you hiding here?

836
02:03:49,514 --> 02:03:51,154
Jew?

837
02:03:53,994 --> 02:03:56,315
Where are you hiding yourself?

838
02:03:57,915 --> 02:03:59,835
In the attic.

839
02:04:02,915 --> 02:04:05,195
Show it to me.

840
02:04:27,676 --> 02:04:29,876
Have you got anything to eat?

841
02:05:14,317 --> 02:05:19,678
According to them,
it's very important that...

842
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:27,878
Attention!

843
02:05:29,518 --> 02:05:32,438
- At ease.
- At ease.

844
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,921
Jew?

845
02:06:50,761 --> 02:06:52,161
Please.

846
02:06:52,561 --> 02:06:54,521
What does it mean,
all that shooting?

847
02:06:55,001 --> 02:06:57,681
The Russians,
on the other side of the river.

848
02:06:58,961 --> 02:07:02,282
You just have to hold on
a couple of weeks, not more.

849
02:08:30,045 --> 02:08:32,765
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

850
02:08:35,565 --> 02:08:38,725
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

851
02:08:41,525 --> 02:08:45,245
I don't know how to thank you.

852
02:08:46,645 --> 02:08:48,766
Thank God, not me.

853
02:08:49,206 --> 02:08:54,606
He wants us to survive. At least,
we have to believe in that.

854
02:09:04,006 --> 02:09:07,246
Here. Take it.

855
02:09:08,206 --> 02:09:12,366
- And you?
- I have another one. Warmer.

856
02:09:16,607 --> 02:09:20,047
What are you going to do
when this is over?

857
02:09:21,767 --> 02:09:25,967
I'll play piano again at
the Polish radio station.

858
02:09:26,767 --> 02:09:28,527
Tell me your name.

859
02:09:28,727 --> 02:09:31,287
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

860
02:09:31,407 --> 02:09:33,487
Szpilman.

861
02:09:37,487 --> 02:09:40,287
Perfect name for a pianist.

862
02:10:59,170 --> 02:11:01,730
German! German!

863
02:11:23,931 --> 02:11:26,491
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

864
02:11:27,451 --> 02:11:29,412
I'm Polish!

865
02:11:30,132 --> 02:11:32,732
- Come out with your hands up!
- Please! I beg of you!

866
02:11:33,412 --> 02:11:37,892
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish.

867
02:11:38,092 --> 02:11:40,052
Come down!

868
02:11:43,452 --> 02:11:47,412
Please, I'm Polish.
Please.

869
02:11:47,612 --> 02:11:49,692
He's Polish.

870
02:11:52,412 --> 02:11:54,612
Yes, he's Polish.

871
02:11:55,813 --> 02:11:58,173
Why the fucking coat?

872
02:11:59,173 --> 02:12:01,373
I'm cold.

873
02:12:19,573 --> 02:12:22,494
Look at them.
German fuckers!

874
02:12:23,014 --> 02:12:25,894
Murderers! Murderers!

875
02:12:26,134 --> 02:12:29,254
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

876
02:12:29,414 --> 02:12:32,774
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

877
02:12:32,894 --> 02:12:36,734
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

878
02:12:36,894 --> 02:12:40,174
You took my violin,
you took my soul.

879
02:12:44,854 --> 02:12:46,454
Musician?

880
02:12:47,614 --> 02:12:49,495
Are you a musician?

881
02:12:50,415 --> 02:12:52,535
Do you know...

882
02:12:52,815 --> 02:12:55,855
a pianist called Szpilman,
from the Polish radio station?

883
02:12:56,055 --> 02:13:01,095
- Of course I know him.
- I helped him to hide himself.

884
02:13:01,855 --> 02:13:03,895
Tell him I'm here.

885
02:13:04,655 --> 02:13:06,735
Ask him to help me.

886
02:13:09,655 --> 02:13:12,335
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.

887
02:13:12,575 --> 02:13:13,735
What?

888
02:14:51,619 --> 02:14:54,099
It was here, I'm certain of it.

889
02:14:56,059 --> 02:14:58,099
Well, it's not here now.

890
02:14:58,299 --> 02:15:02,260
I shouted, abused them. I'm not
proud of it, but that's what I did.

891
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:03,860
I stood where you are now.

892
02:15:05,060 --> 02:15:08,260
There was a barbed wire
and this German came up to me.

893
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:13,020
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

894
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:18,300
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
