1
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,440
Come on, you lazy Kaffirs.
Come on.

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,360
Keep in line, man. Keep in line.

3
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,800
What are you looking at me
like that for, you fuck?

4
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,360
What are you looking at?
I'll fuck you up!

5
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,920
Move!

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,200
You men make sure
that's tied down properly, you hear me?

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,040
Careful, man!

8
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,440
- Pa, why is it taking so long?
- Go back to your mother.

9
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,800
Move your feet, move your feet, come on!

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,080
I said, go back!

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,080
Move!

12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,160
Sergeant Gregory, Dannie Bosman,
the old skipper for the crossing.

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,120
- Your first time to Robben Island?
- I hear the fishing is excellent.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,080
- You'll get bored with that soon enough.
- Ah.

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,600
What prison are you from?

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,600
Kroonstad Maximum Security.

17
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,880
Well, Robben Island
is a totally different ball game.

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,360
All prisoners below deck and secured,
Captain.

19
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,280
Ladies and children, all aboard please!

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,640
- Where's your mom?
- Busy putting on her lipstick.

21
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,680
We can board now, sweetie.

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,320
- How do I look?
- You look great.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,000
- As long as I don't get seasick.
- It's only an hour.

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,800
- Will I be able to get my own bedroom, Pa?
- Of course you will.

25
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,440
I don't want to share with Natasha again.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,920
Who said I want to share with you?

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,720
You two stop fighting
and behave yourselves.

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,960
Remember, first impressions are everything.

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,160
Are all the prisoners
on the island black, Ma?

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,640
- All of them.
- But at Kroonstad, they were white.

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,200
Now, we don't mix whites and blacks,
not even in the prisons.

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,560
These are not just criminals, Brent.
These are terrorists.

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,240
But what's the difference?

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,840
Terrorists are terrible people.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,400
They want to kill all the whites
and take our land away from us.

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
Which is why we lock them up on the island.

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,240
Sergeant Gregory.

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,800
Captain Devett,
the personnel officer on the island.

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,520
How do you do, Captain? I'm Gloria...

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,800
I have a jeep standing by. This way.
Your furniture will follow.

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,680
One, two.

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,640
All aboard, Captain.

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,440
This is it.

44
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,240
You can stand down for today, Sergeant.

45
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,000
<i>This evening you're expected to attend
an officer's braai at the OC's residence.</i>

46
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,400
Missus included. Full dress uniform.

47
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,680
Gloria, I can't find my step-outs.

48
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
Ma is visiting next door, Pa.

49
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,480
Why the toilet outside, Pa?

50
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,360
<i>These houses are old, boet.
They were built during the war.</i>

51
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,720
- What war?
- Second World War.

52
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,080
- But what happens if I need to go at night?
- Then you'll go.

53
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,360
But there are bad people out there.

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,320
Boy, the only bad people on this island
are locked up in jail, okay?

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,240
Okay, Pa.

56
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,640
James, are you decent?

57
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,720
Yeah, why?

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,720
Excuse all the boxes,
but you know how it is.

59
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
This is my husband, James.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,320
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

61
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,320
- Sannie's kindly offered to baby-sit for us.
- Oh, that's very nice.

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,760
Well, Sannie's husband is head chef here.

63
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,120
So, if you ever need anything,
eggs, flour, sugar, you know who to ask.

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,480
Just don't say where it came from.

65
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,960
- I can't find my step-outs.
- Under the bed. I polished them.

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,600
- And you, James, what's your posting?
- He doesn't know yet.

67
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,360
We'll probably find out this evening.

68
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,960
He must be something special,

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,000
'cause the NCOs are never invited
to the Colonel's house.

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,480
Not unless they are in deep trouble.

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,440
- Serious?
- We don't mix.

72
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,720
Officers here are all bloody snobs.

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
I've got dinner on the stove. Give me
a shout when you're ready to go, Gloria.

74
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,760
All right. Thanks, Sannie.

75
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,920
Well, I'm starting to get a bit nervous now.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
You get in with the officers
and they'll nominate you for a commission.

77
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,360
You have to be a warrant officer first, Gloria.

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,640
This is not Worcester, James.

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,840
This is not Kroonstad.

80
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,760
This is Robben Island,
the number one prison in the country.

81
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,520
You play your cards right and who knows,

82
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,520
in five years you could be at head office
in Pretoria.

83
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,840
Dream on.

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
I think I'm going to give you
a quick little haircut before we go.

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,040
Christ, woman, you never stop.

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,440
- Oh, come on.
- Never.

87
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,320
You don't have to wait
to go to the mainland.

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
I'm a fully qualified hairdresser.

89
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,960
- Really?
- And I'm good.

90
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,640
Highlights is what you need. A bit of flair,
then you'll see the heads turning.

91
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,440
Well, are we going to keep you busy,
or what?

92
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,280
This is no holiday camp, Sergeant.

93
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,080
You got warders stuck out here
for two weeks at a time.

94
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
It's a recipe for alcohol abuse,
for prostitution...

95
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,120
Prostitution?

96
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,640
We've got married NCOs pimping
their wives out to single warders

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,480
to supplementing their shitty salaries.

98
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,120
I hope Captain Devett
is not painting too bad a picture of us.

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,800
- Welcome to the island, Gregory.
- It's an honor to be here, sir.

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,240
I see our wives are already making friends.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
Thank you for inviting us, sir.

102
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,160
There's someone who wants to meet you.
Excuse us, Captain.

103
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,040
This is Major Piet Jordaan,
from the Bureau of State Security.

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,000
I believe you speak
the Kaffir languages, Sergeant.

105
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,600
- I speak Xhosa, sir.
- Where did you learn the language?

106
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,120
I grew up on a cattle farm in Transkei.

107
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,520
When you've got no brothers to play with,
you end up playing with the Kaffirs, sir.

108
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,920
Shall we take a walk, Sergeant?

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,360
So, what do you think of the judgment
handed down in Mandela's trial?

110
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,480
In my opinion,
he should have got the rope, sir.

111
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
Oh, then we could have turned him
into a martyr.

112
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,240
Perhaps he's more use to us behind bars.

113
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,200
That's a waste of taxpayers' money,
is what I say. They all are.

114
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
All blacks?

115
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,240
Certainly the ones who took up
arms against us. The communists.

116
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,920
Mandela denies he's a communist.

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,400
Well, they're all liars, aren't they?

118
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,440
You know, in the 1800s,
this whole island was a leper colony.

119
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,640
Nothing's really changed then.

120
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,240
How do you feel about heading up
the censorship office in B-section?

121
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,560
Excuse my ignorance, sir,
but what is B-section?

122
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,200
That's where we keep Mandela
and all his mates.

123
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,240
I need someone on the inside,
someone who speaks their language.

124
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,000
I want to know what they think,
how they think.

125
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,080
Anything you find odd in their letters
or their visits,

126
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,720
you report directly back to me.

127
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,360
I want you to be my window into their soul,
if they have a soul.

128
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,080
And here I was thinking

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,600
I was going to spend my first year
working bloody nightshifts.

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,840
- You can if you want.
- No. Please, no, sir.

131
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,040
It would be an honor for me
to run the censorship office.

132
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
I won't let you down.

133
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,960
You let me down,
you let your country down.

134
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,520
- I would never do such a thing.
- Of course not.

135
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,480
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm bloody starving.

136
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,920
Let's go and get something to eat.

137
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,560
- They asleep?
- Finally.

138
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,280
Too much bloody excitement.

139
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,040
The Colonel's wife, Joyce,
is coming over tomorrow for a cut.

140
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,760
She bakes so she'll pay with a cake.

141
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,000
And Hettie,
you know that nice captain's wife?

142
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,480
Her husband dives for crayfish

143
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,240
so that's how she'll pay.
And that woman with the gray hair...

144
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,240
- Gloria.
- What?

145
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,240
They're putting me with Mandela and Sisulu
and them.

146
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,000
No.

147
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,120
They want me in charge
of the censorship office.

148
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,280
My God, James,
why didn't you say something?

149
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,360
Wasn't going to blow my trumpet
in front of all those bloody officers.

150
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,720
This is big, my boy. Mandela.

151
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,000
Never mind that, I report directly to Pretoria.

152
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,600
This is fantastic.
Did they say anything about a promotion?

153
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,120
In due course, I was told.

154
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
No more discipline order for me.

155
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,240
From now on, I'm in charge of the worst
terrorist this country's ever seen.

156
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,880
Do you know how many bridges
he's blown up?

157
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
Do you know how many police stations

158
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
<i>he and his Umkhonto we Sizwe
have bombed?</i>

159
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,360
Didn't I say this was going to be our island
in the sun? Didn't I say that, James?

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,280
You sure did, Booky.

161
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,080
Put your backs into it, you lazy Kaffirs!

162
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,960
Get up, you slack bastards!

163
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,080
Three days off rations for insubordination.

164
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,680
Attention!

165
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,520
I'm your new censorship officer!

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
If you want to post a letter,
you do it through me!

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,920
One letter every six months,
no longer than 500 words.

168
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,760
No reference to other prisoners,
no mention of prison conditions.

169
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,200
And no bloody politics.

170
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,640
If you fail to adhere to these regulations,
your letters will not be posted.

171
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,680
If you receive a letter, it comes through me.

172
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,600
Same story. One every six months.

173
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,920
Any mention of politics
and that letter will be censored.

174
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,800
Is that clear?

175
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,720
You fuck with me and I'll make your life
a lot more miserable than it already is.

176
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,720
And I'll enjoy doing so.

177
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,400
Which one is Mandela?

178
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,880
He's in solitary.
Five days for talking in the passage.

179
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Right! Back to work!

180
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,360
Let's see you breaking some rocks!

181
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,000
Last one on the right.
It's nice and damp in there.

182
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,960
Hey, you.

183
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm talking to you, man. Look at me!

184
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,760
I'll see you, Mandela

185
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,080
Mrs. Mandela, Sergeant Gregory.
I'll be monitoring your visit.

186
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,080
- How do you do, Sergeant?
- Follow me.

187
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Vosloo, let's call prisoner 466l64 to Booth 3.
Here, please.

188
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,120
You speak only in English.

189
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,560
And only about family matters.

190
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,200
Prisoner ready.

191
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,480
You have 30 minutes, starting now.

192
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,720
<i>- How are you, Madiba?
- Compose yourself.</i>

193
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,680
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

194
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,800
<i>How are our daughters?</i>

195
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,320
They can't sleep at night.

196
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,040
Terrified the security will come
and bash down our door.

197
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,840
That is political, Mrs. Mandela.

198
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,800
<i>It is not. It is about our family.</i>

199
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,920
There is too much harassment
from all sides all the time.

200
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,360
It is upsetting the girls.

201
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,240
George Bizos suggests we send them
to a boarding school in Swaziland.

202
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
<i>They'll come home on holidays.</i>

203
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,960
<i>Will you cope being alone?</i>

204
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,440
When I married you,
I knew I was marrying the struggle.

205
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,920
<i>Have you heard from Evelyn?</i>

206
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,880
She has a job at the mines, typing.

207
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,840
Thembi came to visit.

208
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,920
<i>How is my son?</i>

209
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,320
He's a man now.

210
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,880
<i>He has his driver's license and his own car.</i>

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,320
<i>Tell him I'm allowed another visit
in six months' time.</i>

212
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,520
<i>He has to put in an application.</i>

213
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,120
I will tell him.

214
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,760
<i>How are our friends in Lusaka?</i>

215
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,120
Oliver has been appointed
President General of the ANC.

216
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,160
<i>English only.</i>

217
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,280
<i>Tell Oliver that all of us in here
agree he should escalate the armed struggle.</i>

218
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,280
<i>The people must make
this country ungovernable.</i>

219
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,600
That's it.

220
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,000
Vosloo, this visit is terminated.

221
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,040
This way, please.

222
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
No, please,
we were talking about family matters.

223
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,680
Do you think I'm stupid?

224
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,440
Vosloo, escort the prisoner back to his cell.
Follow me.

225
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,400
On your feet, Mandela, move!

226
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
Gregory!

227
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,360
- That was quick.
- They started talking in Xhosa.

228
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,600
About what?

229
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,960
Mandela told her to instruct Oliver Tambo
to escalate the armed struggle.

230
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,040
He said they must make
the country ungovernable.

231
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,760
- Anything else?
- Family stuff.

232
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,440
Kids going off to boarding school,
that sort of thing.

233
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,760
When Winnie gets back to Joburg,
she's going to be detained indefinitely.

234
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,400
It's going to be front-page news.
I'll send you a clipping.

235
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
Make sure Mandela gets it.

236
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,520
No problem.

237
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,720
Oh, one small thing.

238
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,960
She mentioned his son Thembi,
the one from his first marriage.

239
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,480
He's got his driver's license.
He even has his own car.

240
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,960
- He probably stole the bloody thing.
- Right.

241
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,080
Highlights really
look fantastic on you.

242
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,000
- Hello, sweetie.
- Ladies.

243
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,760
- How was your day?
- Good. Where are the kids?

244
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,560
Switch on the kettle, won't you?
Make us all a nice cup of tea.

245
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,600
- What do you think, James?
- About what?

246
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,320
Her hair.

247
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,360
Oh, it's nice.

248
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,360
Nice? Please, it's stunning.

249
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,360
Wait till Jan sees it.
You're in for a busy night, my girl.

250
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,440
I believe Mama Africa
paid us a visit today, James.

251
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,440
You girls seem to know everything.

252
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,440
Nothing happens on this island
without me finding out about it.

253
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,440
Usually before it happens.

254
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,080
So what's she like?

255
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,760
She was only there five minutes.

256
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
They started talking Xhosa
so I sent her packing.

257
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,560
James speaks fluent Xhosa.

258
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,520
- Really?
- He grew up with them on a farm.

259
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,280
He had a friend called...
What was his name?

260
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,600
Man, who cares?

261
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,360
- No, man, tell us.
- Please tell us, James.

262
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,080
Bafana.

263
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,080
James has got a photo of the two of them.
I'll get it.

264
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,960
Gloria, no. Gloria!

265
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,920
- No, I want to see it.
- Me, too.

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,280
Didn't know you were a farm boy, James.

267
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,600
- I'm not a farm boy.
- Here it is. Look.

268
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,520
Oh, cute. Look at the little Kaffir lover.

269
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,960
I'm not a Kaffir lover!

270
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,200
He's even got his arm
around the little nigger.

271
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,480
That's it.
- Looks like a Kaffir-lover to me!

272
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm going fishing. Brent, get your rod!

273
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,280
Look, Pa, a starfish.

274
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,680
- That's nice, Natasha.
- Pa, I've got one.

275
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,880
Hey, bring him through the rocks there.
Nice and slow, that's it.

276
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,560
Hey, don't look at me, man.

277
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,400
Don't look at me.
I'm not your bloody mother, man.

278
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,320
- Give me that, Brent. Come here.
- Move it! Bastard!

279
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,600
Natasha, come here, girl.

280
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,440
Stay down. Stay there.

281
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,120
- Pa, what about my fish?
- Never mind your fish.

282
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,320
- Faster, faster, faster!
- Come, come, come!

283
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,640
Are you trying to piss me off?

284
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
- Get down, boy!
- But, Pa...

285
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,000
Move it, you lazy bastards.

286
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,440
All right then, we can go back now.
Come on. Okay?

287
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Move it!

288
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,480
But what about my fish?

289
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,360
I'm sorry, boy, but if those warders
had seen you, I'd be in big trouble.

290
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,560
- Why?
- Prisoners aren't allowed to see children.

291
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,040
- Why not?
- Because they are here for punishment.

292
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Okay?

293
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,880
Huh.

294
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
This is from Motsadi's wife.

295
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,120
"We have decided to boycott the bus service
as they have increased the fare by 80 cents."

296
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,800
Cut it out.

297
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,880
<i>The following,
please collect your letters.</i>

298
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,400
Sisulu.

299
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,880
Mhlaba.

300
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,520
Kathadra, hurry up.
Do you think I've got all day?

301
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,440
Motsadi! Jonas Motsadi! Where's Motsadi?

302
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,640
The rest of you are dismissed.

303
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,880
Mr. Gregory, I found this in my cell.

304
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,560
According to regulations,
no prisoner may be in possession

305
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,720
of any newspaper or part thereof.

306
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,800
Therefore, I am handing it over to you,
the proper authority.

307
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,360
I am surprised that you did not look
at the article, Mr. Gregory.

308
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,160
- Come on! Come on!
- That's it. Yes, go, Robben Island.

309
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,040
Yes!

310
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Yes! Yes!

311
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Ah!

312
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,920
- He's really got something, hey, darling?
- Very good.

313
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,560
Gregory, for a postman,
you play a damn good game of rugby.

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,120
- Robben Island!
- Robben Island.

315
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,240
I think it's time I had a word with Piet
about James.

316
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,640
He's officer material,
there's no question about it.

317
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,240
Oh, Joyce. I'll do your hair for free
for the rest of your life.

318
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,280
Then I'm definitely going to talk with Piet.

319
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,400
- Off to Cape Town for the weekend?
- Yeah, my mom's been dying to see the kids.

320
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,880
It's been ages.

321
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,560
Then I'm going to give you
a little shopping list

322
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
with a good mayonnaise at the top.

323
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,640
I can't stand this prison issue stuff.

324
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,920
- Granny!
- Granny!

325
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,040
Hello, my darlings!

326
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,080
These are for you.
I found them on the beach.

327
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,400
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- Hi, Mom.

328
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,400
- How was the ferry?
- Fine. The sea was flat for a change.

329
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,880
- Oh, good.
- I got you some fresh crayfish, Barbara.

330
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,360
Oh!

331
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,840
Never mind fresh, they're alive!

332
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, seeing as you didn't get seasick,
we can go shopping.

333
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,880
- Nelson Mandela. That's awful.
- Yeah, it's a big responsibility.

334
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,200
James gets to check their mail
and monitors all their visits.

335
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,120
That's restricted information, Gloria.

336
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,160
Oh, for goodness sake,
Mom's not going to tell anyone.

337
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,720
Gloria, come help me choose
some salad stuff quickly.

338
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,560
I'll wait outside with the kids. Come here.

339
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,400
The two of you, stand still.

340
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,680
Passport. Where's your passport?
Let me see your passports.

341
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,160
- Where's your passport?
- Your pass.

342
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,160
You have no pass. Come, come, come.

343
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,800
What's going on, Pa?

344
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,960
Passports. Where is your pass?

345
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,160
They are checking for passes.

346
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,840
- Come back here. Where's your pass?
- No! No!

347
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,200
Come back, come back.

348
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,520
Hey, freeze, Kaffir.

349
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
I need some help over here.

350
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,880
Get in the van!

351
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,680
Where's your pass?
- I don't have it!

352
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,960
You can't just leave the baby here!

353
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,600
Hey, shut up!
It's none of your business.

354
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,320
I'll take him. He's my daughter's child.

355
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,320
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
It's okay.

356
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,240
Maybe you should go talk to her.

357
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Another minute and these'll be done, okay?

358
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,320
Feeling better?

359
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,320
- Dinner's almost ready.
- Why didn't you stop that policeman?

360
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,960
Because that's his job.

361
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,640
To take the mommy away from the baby?

362
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,400
No, but if the mommy doesn't have a pass,
then she's not allowed to be there.

363
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,680
So they had to arrest her.

364
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,400
Do we have a pass?

365
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,120
- We don't need one.
- Why not?

366
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,120
Because we're white.

367
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,640
- But is that fair, Pa?
- That's apartheid.

368
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,480
It's the way we live, Natasha.
Whites on one side, blacks on the other.

369
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,400
It's God's way, darling.

370
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,200
Just like he doesn't
put a sparrow with a swallow.

371
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,480
Or a goose with a duck
or a cow with a buck.

372
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,120
It's just not natural.
And we don't question God.

373
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,280
Hmm?

374
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
<i>Switchboard.</i>

375
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,840
Pretoria 39001.

376
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,360
Jordaan.

377
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,280
<i>Gregory here.
A telegram just arrived for Mandela.</i>

378
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,040
I know, the boy smashed head on
into a bridge.

379
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,440
- Was it...
- What?

380
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,640
You know. Is it an accident?

381
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,680
<i>Of course.
You'll tell him personally, won't you?</i>

382
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,840
Yeah.

383
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,280
Let me know his reaction.

384
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,800
What's up?

385
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,000
Mandela's older son
was killed in a car crash.

386
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,320
Good riddance.

387
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,120
Do you have kids?

388
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,280
Dig. Hey, work, you Kaffir!

389
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,640
Who the fuck is Madiba?

390
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,720
- Madiba is Mandela's clan name.
- Clan?

391
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,320
Go tell him.

392
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,920
Mandela, I'm sorry.

393
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,320
Hey, what are you trying to do, man?
Get back to work.

394
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,720
- Vann Niekerk, can I have a word?
- What?

395
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,080
Regulation 16-A of the Prison Act states
that if a prisoner loses a family member

396
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,000
they are entitled to two days off work
on compassionate grounds.

397
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,520
- Compassionate grounds?
- Mandela's a lawyer.

398
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,760
He knows these things. You don't want him
laying a charge against you, do you?

399
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,160
I can escort him back to his cell, if you like.

400
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,560
<i>Earlier today,
South African forces intercepted</i>

401
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,480
<i>a large group of SWAPO insurgents
in South West Africa, killing 12...</i>

402
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,640
- Would you like some more?
- Yes, please.

403
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,680
<i>...and arresting five. There were no reports...</i>

404
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,720
Thank you.

405
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,880
<i>...of casualties on the South African side.</i>

406
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,920
<i>Dr. Christian...</i>

407
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,480
Your food's getting cold.

408
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,960
- What if it was murder?
- Not in front of the children.

409
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,000
James!

410
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,480
They'd never do such a thing.

411
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,640
I called the police in the Transkei.
I spoke to the duty officer.

412
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,720
The more questions I asked,
the more he clammed up.

413
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,080
Eventually he hung up on me.

414
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,480
- That doesn't mean...
- Can I serve the jelly, Ma?

415
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,120
Go ahead, darling.

416
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,800
I was the one who told Jordaan

417
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,760
that Thembi had a license, that he had a car.

418
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,560
You're doing your job.
This country is at war, James.

419
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,480
These people are savages.

420
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,120
They don't want to share
this country with us. They hate us.

421
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,600
If they had their way, they'd drive
every single white person into the sea.

422
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,360
They'd leave us with nothing,
not even the clothes on our back.

423
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,560
Yeah. I know.

424
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,000
Come and have pudding.

425
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,240
All right, you win this time.

426
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
There won't be a next time.

427
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,240
I'll come back and visit.
I promise I will, Bafana.

428
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,280
My father says
you are going too far to ever return.

429
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,760
I have to go.

430
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,680
This tail will protect you
the rest of your days.

431
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,680
I will wear this forever.

432
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,400
- I see you, Madiba.
- I see you, Mr. Gregory.

433
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,920
I want you to know that I am very sorry
about the death of your son.

434
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,800
Many times I tried to explain
to my son why I was always away from home,

435
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,200
that I fight for a better world,
for my people and my family.

436
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
I'm not sure he ever understood.

437
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,760
Where did you learn to speak Xhosa,
Mr. Gregory?

438
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,800
I grew up
near where you were born.

439
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,920
Then you understand.
I need to bury my son.

440
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,920
- You know they'll never allow it.
- I'm an honorable man.

441
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,080
I give you my word I will not try to escape.

442
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,520
It's not you.

443
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,800
It's your communist friends,
what if they try to rescue you?

444
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,360
What communist friends
are you referring to, Mr. Gregory?

445
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,280
The whole of the bloody
African National Congress.

446
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,000
Obviously, you have not read
the Freedom Charter.

447
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,080
- I have.
- You have not. It is a banned document.

448
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,600
Where would a sergeant
in the Prison Services

449
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,480
get his hands on such a document?

450
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,000
Well, I know about it.

451
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,520
Then you would know
that all we want is equal rights for all,

452
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,200
a world where people like you and I
can live peacefully side by side.

453
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,320
That is what I wanted for my child.

454
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,000
Surely, you want the same for your children.

455
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,760
I wish to be alone now.

456
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,160
- Motsadi, Mandela must eat.
- When our leader is ready to eat, he will eat.

457
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,640
You tell him his son was buried yesterday,

458
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,440
that the boy's mother was at the funeral.

459
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,880
- Have you read the Freedom Charter?
- What?

460
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,920
- The Freedom Charter, have you read it?
- No.

461
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,400
Do you know what it's about?

462
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,000
It's about the extermination of the whites.

463
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,280
- Stuff like that, isn't it?
- How must I know?

464
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,240
Pa, can we go watch Province
play against Natal on Saturday?

465
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
- Maybe.
- Yes!

466
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,280
I just need to quickly pop
into Roeland Street Prison.

467
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,120
- But my mom's got lunch waiting for us.
- You go ahead. I'll be on the next train.

468
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,480
But Roeland Street is not...

469
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,320
Go, kids! Go.

470
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,840
Excuse me, I understand there's
a section here containing banned literature.

471
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,720
- Downstairs.
- Thank you.

472
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,160
- Yes?
- I'm with the Prison Services.

473
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,240
I'd like to take a look
at the Freedom Charter.

474
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,640
Wait here.

475
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,800
- You got authorization?
- What?

476
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,040
This is a restricted area.
You need authorization to be here.

477
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,760
Sergeant Gregory.
I'm a warder at Robben Island prison.

478
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,880
So? You need authorization
from the security police

479
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,560
if you want to look at banned material.

480
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,960
Listen here, Major Jordaan
of the Bureau of State Security

481
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,240
personally instructed me
to take a look at the Freedom Charter.

482
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,920
Call him. It's Pretoria 39001.

483
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,360
Give him what he wants.

484
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,840
Sit there.

485
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,360
- You'll find it in there.
- Thank you.

486
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
<i>"We, the People of South Africa,</i>

- What are you doing here, James?
- What are you doing here?

492
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,400
I can't believe you did that.
How can you lie to me?

493
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,600
Gloria, I'm working with them.
I need to know how they tick.

494
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll tell you how they tick, James.
They tick like a time bomb.

495
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,920
And then they blow up, boom!

496
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,400
Sit up straight.

497
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,200
Afternoon.

498
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,680
Can you imagine what would happen
if Piet found out about this?

499
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
You could kiss your promotion goodbye,
that's for sure.

500
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,680
Please, man, what promotion?

501
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,000
- I promised Joyce I wouldn't say anything.
- About what?

502
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,960
Come on, Gloria, you can't keep a secret.

503
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,760
Piet put a recommendation into Pretoria
that you be promoted to warrant officer.

504
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,840
He even told Joyce if you carry on
the way you are,

505
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,720
you'll be lieutenant at the end of the year.

506
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
Well, that's very nice.

507
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,120
Not if you throw it all away
by doing something stupid.

508
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,600
I'm not going to do anything stupid.

509
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,880
With the salary you get and the little I make,

510
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,720
we can't even afford to buy the kids
new school shoes.

511
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,960
Come on, Gloria. Come on.

512
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,240
- It's not that bad, Gloria.
- James.

513
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,800
The Prison Service is all we've got.

514
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,840
Christ, they even own the house we live in.

515
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,280
I'm not going to mess things up. Okay?

516
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,880
Look at me. Okay?

517
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,480
Plumstead is up next.
I don't want your mom seeing you like this.

518
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,680
- Hey, man. How was your weekend?
- Good.

519
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,400
- Did you go watch the Province match?
- No, but they nailed them good.

520
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,120
Are you looking at me?
Don't you look at me. Move it!

521
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Come, come, come.

522
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,760
You slack bastards! Move it!

523
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,200
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

524
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,720
- The post will have arrived by now.
- Not with this southeaster blowing.

525
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,080
- That ferry will be an hour late, at least.
- Go check anyway.

526
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,480
<i>"The national wealth of our
country, the heritage of South Africans,</i>

<i>"The mineral wealth, the banks,

529
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,560
The ferry hasn't even left Cape Town harbor.

530
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,240
- It must be pretty rough out there.
- You can say that again.

531
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,360
Mandela, I have a question for you.

532
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,920
You claim the ANC is not communist,
but the Freedom Charter says

533
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,680
that the mineral wealth,
the banks and industry

534
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,080
shall be transferred to the people.

535
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,280
That is communism,
and don't try to bullshit me otherwise.

536
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,000
It is not. It is in fact true nationalism,

537
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,280
where all the people,
white, black, colored, Indian,

538
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,120
all benefit from the accumulated wealth
of the land.

539
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,440
Our land and your land, Mr. Gregory.

540
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,760
- These are ideals you'd kill for?
- These are ideals I would die for.

541
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,240
It's not justification for murder
and you know it.

542
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,960
You people should never
have taken up arms against us.

543
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,480
You white people were deaf to our pleas,
blind to our suffering.

544
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,080
You left us no choice but to take up arms.

545
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,360
Sergeant!
- Sir!

546
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,880
What are you doing cavorting
with a prisoner?

547
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,440
I was just telling Mandela his lawyer
is coming on Monday for a consultation, sir.

548
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,640
- Get your arse up here.
- On my way, sir.

549
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,480
Raise your arms.

550
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,080
- Sir, I can...
- Raise your bloody arms, Sergeant!

551
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,880
Congratulations, Warrant Officer.
I'll see you in the clubhouse.

552
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,400
Thank you, sir.

And may his promotion not go to his head
and cause us a lot of heartache!

558
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,440
Cheers, James.

559
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,960
Officer Gregory, may I have the pleasure
of dancing with you?

560
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,760
Didn't I say this would happen? Didn't I?

561
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,320
You sure did, Booky.

562
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,120
What you going to do about it?

563
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,000

566
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,400
I've got a postcard here for Jonas Motsadi.

567
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,480
Motsadi. Isn't he due for release next week?

568
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,200
Yes. There's a message written inside it
in Xhosa.

569
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,720
What does it say?

570
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,320
It says he must go
to an ANC safe house in Gaborone

571
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,840
<i>and from there, he'll receive instructions.</i>

572
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,760
Is there an address?

573
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,080
36 Moroka Street, Gaborone, Botswana.

574
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Put the message back just how you found it

575
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,080
and make sure that Jonas Motsadi
gets his little postcard.

That's us, Pa. Robben Island.

589
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,600

Go, move it! Yes, yes, yes!

595
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,280
Faster.

596
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,080
Are you sure
my wife is on the ferry?

597
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,480
I called ahead.

598
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,800
It will be Christmas soon.
- My kids are already counting the days.

599
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,960
How are they doing in school here?

600
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,520
My son struggles a bit,
but my daughter is sharp as nails.

601
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,320
You must encourage them
to do well in school

602
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,880
so they can go to university
and make something of their lives.

603
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,520
University is expensive, man.

604
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,840
Although you bloody people
think it should be

605
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,280
"free, compulsory, universal
and equal for all children," isn't it?

606
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,600
That is a direct quote
from the Freedom Charter.

607
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,800
I am most impressed, Mr. Gregory.

608
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,200
Mr. Gregory,
I have a favor to ask.

609
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,040
I have a small Christmas present for Winnie
and I was hoping you could give it to her.

610
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,200
No, man, Mandela.
Now you're going too far.

611
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,880
It's just a small chocolate.

612
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,360
Where the hell
did you get a chocolate from?

613
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,800
That is of no consequence.

614
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,000
I could have you in solitary
right this bloody minute!

615
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,840
I have not seen my wife for two years.

616
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,560
For God's sake, man,
where is your humanity?

617
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,680
Where is it?

618
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,000
Drop it and walk on.

619
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,360
- I'll escort Mrs. Mandela from here.
- My orders are to remain with her...

620
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,600
I am in charge of visits on this island,

621
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,840
and you will remain on this bloody ferry
until it leaves! Please.

622
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,440
<i>I see you, Madiba.</i>

623
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,480
<i>What have they done to you, Namzamu?</i>

624
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,960
<i>They dragged me from our daughters.
They beat me.</i>

625
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,240
English only.

626
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,960
<i>Please, Mrs. Mandela,
you have very little time. Don't waste it.</i>

627
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,600
<i>Mr. Gregory is right.</i>

628
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,760
From Nelson.
He says it's your Christmas present.

629
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,520
Have a safe journey, Mrs. Mandela.

630
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,320
Warrant Officer!

631
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,320
You recognize this?

632
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,840
That's Govan Mbeki's writing.

633
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,800
It was intercepted by Security Branch
at the Soweto post office.

634
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,200
Since when are prisoners allowed
to discuss other prisoners in their letters?

635
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,920
I would never have allowed this through.
Vosloo must have missed it.

636
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,320
You're in charge of the Censor Office,
not Vosloo.

637
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,440
- Make sure this doesn't happen again.
- Yes, sir.

638
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,680
- Nice work with Jonas Motsadi.
- Thank you, sir.

639
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,840
<i>- Warrant Officer Gregory.
- Gregory, get your arse over here!</i>

640
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,960
I'm on my way, sir.

641
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,480
Enter!

642
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,480
What is the meaning of this?

643
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,600
It says here, they sat under a tree,
ate bread and cheese

644
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,600
and finished it up
with a dessert of chocolate.

645
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,560
You know the media,
they always exaggerate.

646
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,200
Are you telling me
there's some truth in this?

647
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,600
Mandela gave me a little chocolate
to give to Winnie.

648
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,240
- That's all that happened, sir.
- A little chocolate?

649
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,640
- That was her Christmas present.
- Are you completely mad?

650
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,520
We are trying to demoralize this terrorist,
trying to isolate him from his family,

651
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,280
and here you are playing Santa Claus.

652
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,920
How do you know there wasn't a message
in that chocolate?

653
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,400
I checked it before I gave it to her.

654
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,160
And if it had been poisoned?

655
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,720
- Nelson would never do such a thing.
- Since when was he "Nelson"?

656
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,520
Next thing,
you'll be wiping his fucking arse!

657
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,200
I apologize, sir. It was my mistake.

658
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,120
Let me tell you how
you are going to pay for this.

659
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,680
For the next four months,
you will spend every off weekend

660
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,320
doing night duty in B-section.
Are you happy with this?

661
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,280
Or would you rather I stripped you
of your rank, Warrant Officer?

662
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,520
- I'm happy with night duty, sir.
- Get out of here!

663
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,320
<i>- Yes?
- Colonel, the Minister of Prisons...</i>

664
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,520
James Gregory, you swine.
Do you know what trouble you've caused?

665
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,560
Sorry?

666
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,280
They should be transferring you
off the island, not us!

667
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,320
What's going on?

668
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,400
Pretoria just called.
They told Piet to pack his bags!

669
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,720
They are transferring us to Barberton.

670
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,840
Do you know how hot it is in Barberton?

671
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,240
I don't understand.

672
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,080
They said that Piet is running
a holiday camp here instead of a prison,

673
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,160
- and all because of you, James Gregory!
- Joyce, don't shout like that at James.

674
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,360
- If you've got something to say come inside.
- Oh, I will not step foot inside that house!

675
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,440
After everything we've done for you.

676
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,880
What on earth was that all about?

677
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,240
- I gave Winnie Mandela a chocolate from...
- James.

678
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,640
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

679
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,920
Well, we can forget about
you making lieutenant now.

680
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,400
Maybe there are more important things
to think about than making lieutenant.

681
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,200
Do you have a home to go to, Sannie?

682
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,640
<i>My name is Stander,</i>

683
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,280
and you will remember my name
until the day you die!

684
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,040
Most of you bastards
joined the prison service

685
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:44,320
because you were too cowardly
to join the police or the army.

686
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,520
The army that is right now
defending our borders

687
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,400
against the communist masses
trying to infiltrate our beloved fatherland.

688
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,440
And the police,
who are fighting in the townships

689
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,000
so that your wives and mothers
and daughters and sisters

690
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,840
can sleep safely in their beds at night
and not get raped by fucking Kaffirs

691
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,800
while you sit comfortably on your arses
on paradise fucking island.

692
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,400
Well, that all changes as from today,

693
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:22,000
because this island is now my island.

694
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,360
And the war will be fought on my island
the same way

695
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,280
that it is fought against SWAPO
on the borders

696
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,000
and the ANC and the PAC in the townships.

697
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:39,440
Your enemy is behind these walls,

698
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,720
and you are at war with them.

699
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,840
Is that clear?

700
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,280
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

701
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,800
Is that fucking clear?

702
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,080
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

703
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,760
Move you, Kaffir dogs! Stand in line!

704
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,680
Come on!

705
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,760
Welcome to hell, you heathen bastards.

706
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,760
We're freedom fighters.
We are not heathens.

707
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,560
Thank you, Boytjie. I don't want that animal
bleeding in my prison.

708
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,200
Chain him to the flag post,

709
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,680
so he remembers forever
what flag flies above this land.

710
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,920
Strip search.

711
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,680
Beer, please.

712
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,920
How you doing, Dannie?

713
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,720
Not bad.

714
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,440
So, they're finally going to
let us have television,

715
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,200
20 years after the rest of the world.

716
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Suit yourself, Dannie.

717
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,040
Yes, two triple brandies, please.

718
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,440
Is this him?

719
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,040
You don't have a chocolate for me, too,
do you?

720
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,600
Very funny.

721
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,160
So, tell us about Mandela.

722
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,720
What does he write in those letters
to his fat, black, bitch wife, huh?

723
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,600
I'm trying to have a quiet drink here.

724
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,800
Go on Gregory, tell us, man.

725
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,280
<i>Vann Niekerk, do you have any idea why
the prisoners call you Mbukane?</i>

726
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,240
I don't speak Kaffir, so how would I know?

727
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,040
Let me tell you. It means one of those great
big green flies that feasts on human shit.

728
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,000
- Really?
- Really.

729
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,160
So, tell me, is it true what they say
about Gloria, your wife?

730
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,840
What?

731
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,840
That at night you take her up to the prison

732
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,120
so your darky friends can snack
on some white pussy.

733
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,720
Fucking Kaffir lover!

734
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,040
That's enough! That's enough!

735
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,080
James, James, go home to Gloria, James.

736
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,360
Here's his coat.

737
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,480
Jesus! What happened to you?

738
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,000
Nothing. I fell off my bike. It's the rain.

739
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,200
I'll get some ice.

740
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,280
Lynette's having a tea party tomorrow

741
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,080
to welcome Colonel Stander's wife
to the island.

742
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,720
That's very nice.

743
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,080
I haven't been invited.

744
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,680
She probably forgot to call you.

745
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,640
According to Anne, Lynette doesn't
want Kaffir-lover wives at the party.

746
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,760
Fuck them! All of them!

747
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,840
Don't swear like that.

748
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,400
What can I say?

749
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,800
Not much, James.

750
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,920
Even the officers' wives have stopped
coming to have their hair done.

751
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,040
I'm sorry, Gloria.

752
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,760
How could you let things
get to this point, James?

753
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,440
I think if you met Mandela,
you'd understand better.

754
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,320
I heard of a really nice,
small prison near East London

755
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,440
called Fort Glamorgan. They say
it's very pretty on the east coast.

756
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,680
You want me to put in for a transfer?

757
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,240
How would you feel about that?

758
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,760
I'd love to get off this island,
the sooner, the bloody better.

759
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,080
I was hoping you would say that.

760
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,840
And I thought you wanted to stay.

761
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,040
So much for our island in the sun, eh?

762
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,680
Your man on the inside,
does he know why we're coming?

763
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,440
Not yet.
I keep him in the dark most of the time.

764
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,080
You think Mandela will go for it?

765
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,920
In my opinion, no.

766
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,960
Then why in God's name are we doing this?

767
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,200
Public relations.

768
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,280
You've got a visitor.

769
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,680
This is Mr. Kruger, Minister of Prisons.

770
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,400
So, how are you enjoying
living on this island, Mandela?

771
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:58,000
Our cells are damp,
the food is not fit for human consumption,

772
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,560
we are treated worse than
common criminals, and you ask me

773
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,160
how am I enjoying it?

774
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,800
I have a proposition for you
that could change all that.

775
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:12,960
What? One man, one vote?
Free and fair elections for all?

776
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,920
If you and the African National Congress
agree to discontinue the armed struggle,

777
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,680
you can leave this island.

778
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,080
We will let you and your family go live
in Transkei.

779
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,440
Then I would rather remain here
on this island.

780
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,720
Then you are more stupid
than I even thought you were.

781
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,800
We are finished here, Major.

782
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,560
Major.

783
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,720
I put in for a transfer to Glamorgan, but it
was turned down by someone in Pretoria.

784
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,400
Yeah, I turned it down.

785
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,520
Why?

786
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,360
You got a problem with the job here?

787
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,240
The school here only goes up to standard 5.
My son goes to high school next year.

788
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,360
Well, send him to boarding school.

789
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,480
I was at boarding school, and no son
of mine will ever go to a boarding school.

790
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,200
We need you here, Gregory.
These are difficult times.

791
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,480
You must put your country first.

792
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,480
My family comes first.

793
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,720
I'll put in another application.
If it's rejected again, I'll resign.

794
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,400
You're gonna throw away your pension?
Don't be stupid, man.

795
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,920
I'm telling you now, I will resign.

796
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,320
Nobody wants an ex-prison warder.

797
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,520
If you resign, you will be out on the street.
Then where will your family be?

798
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,320
You think about that.

799
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:47,920
Hey, darling.

800
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,720
Rejected again.

801
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,320
We'll manage, James.
We can stay with my mom.

802
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,160
I'll find a job at a salon. We'll get by.

803
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,880
It's not just our future that worries me.

804
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,400
Every time I switch on the radio, all I hear
is another riot, another car bomb,

805
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,080
another suspect who's been chucked out
of the window by the police.

806
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,840
Another landmine.

807
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,080
Is this the country our kids
are growing up in, Gloria?

808
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,360
God help us.

809
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:44,200
Colonel, my letter of resignation.
I'm giving you two weeks' notice.

810
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,000
- I don't have a problem with this.
- I didn't expect you to.

811
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,720
But Pretoria might have a problem with it.

812
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,440
Well, fuck Pretoria.

813
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,800
Gregory! Haven't you forgotten something?

814
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,080
What?

815
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,400
You salute an officer.

816
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,800
What are you going to do, fire me?

817
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,120
Morning, Mrs. Gregory. Is James here?

818
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,480
Wait here.

819
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,240
What are you doing here?

820
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,320
To be honest,
I didn't think you'd call my bluff.

821
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,880
Really?

822
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,320
I got an offer for you.
Let's call it a compromise.

823
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,200
We both want something from each other.

824
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,480
You want to get off the island, and I want
you to keep working with Mandela and them.

825
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,440
You understand them
and you speak their language.

826
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,040
Get to the point.

827
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,320
I can arrange for all the mail from B-section
to be routed through Roeland Street Prison.

828
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,480
You can do everything from there,
without ever setting foot on the island.

829
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,480
- What about visits?
- Vosloo can handle them.

830
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,520
Accommodation?

831
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,920
It so happens that the Prison Service has
a house standing vacant in Plumstead,

832
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,720
quite near to where your mother lives,
Mrs. Gregory.

833
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,120
You've thought of everything.

834
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,720
This is a one-time offer.
I want an answer now.

835
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,520
Yes or no.

836
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,840
Give us a minute.

837
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,080
What do you think?

838
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,080
I think you just won a major battle
for the Gregory family.

839
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,920
Gregory.

840
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,880
You've been rather quiet, lately.

841
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,680
There's been nothing to report.

842
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,840
What, they're finally behaving themselves?

843
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,040
You have time for a beer?

844
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,560
Gloria will be expecting me.

845
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,600
Come on, just a quick one.

846
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,560
So, I believe your son's following
in your footsteps.

847
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,760
Not for long.
He just started his first year at university.

848
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,320
Doing it through correspondence.

849
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,920
Once he gets his degree, he'll be out
of the Prison Services in a flash.

850
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,800
A warder's son at university,
that's a turn up for the books, huh?

851
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,880
He's got Mandela to thank for that.

852
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,600
"Make sure your
children go to university, Mr. Gregory.

853
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,440
"South Africa needs
well-educated young people.

854
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,200
"They will be our future leaders."

855
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,080
- How is he?
- He always asks after you.

856
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,560
Yeah, he's getting on a bit,
but then I suppose we all are.

857
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,400
What do you think of this
Free Mandela campaign?

858
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,400
That's the least of our worries.

859
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,120
Big problem is the international sanctions.
It's crippling us economically.

860
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,360
Yeah, you know something's wrong
when petrol costs more than beer.

861
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,840
Why, do you think we should let him out?

862
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,240
You mad?
With Botha in power, you'll never have him.

863
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,680
Yeah, I suppose you're right there.

864
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,600
- Well, thanks for the beer.
- My pleasure.

865
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,920
I'll see you around, Major.

866
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,760
<i>We clear?</i>

867
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,600
Yeah, I think we can trust Gregory.

868
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,800
<i>- You ready?
- Yeah.</i>

869
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,280
- See you later. Bye.
- Bye.

870
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,720
Hey, sweetie. How was your day?

871
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,600
Same. Yours?

872
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,080
Brent, you should be studying,
not working on that stupid car.

873
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,240
Didn't I send for some plugs, Pa?

874
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,720
Check in the shed for new ones.

875
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
- Pa, there's a call for you.
- I'll be right there.

876
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,520
<i>- Hello.
- Brigadier Morkel, James.</i>

877
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,560
<i>We need you at Pollsmoor tonight.</i>

878
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,600
<i>- Tonight?
- Yes, it's very important.</i>

879
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,160
<i>Make sure to be there at 2000.</i>

880
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,840
I understand, Brigadier. I'll be there.

881
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,960
Do I smell curry?

882
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,400
It's just a chicken curry.

883
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,640
- How did the exam go?
- Not bad.

884
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,680
- Mmm! Not bad or good?
- Good.

885
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,360
Would you like a G&T?

886
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,000
Yeah, just a little one.

887
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,520
You go wash your hands before dinner.

888
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,280
<i>Authorities believe that ANC terrorists</i>

889
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,080
<i>were responsible for the blasts.</i>

890
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,920
<i>According to the report,
there were no casualties,</i>

891
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,880
<i>and damage to the facility was superficial.</i>

892
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,640
<i>And now, for a look at tomorrow's weather...</i>

893
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,240
That was Brigadier Morkel.

894
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,480
I have to report at the Pollsmoor
at 2000 hours.

895
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,840
What for?

896
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,120
He wouldn't say.

897
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,240
Is it Mandela?

898
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,640
Can't be, not if it's Pollsmoor.

899
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,760
Good evening.

900
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,720
Turn left, first road.

901
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,240
- Captain.
- Gregory, follow me.

902
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,480
Evening, James.

903
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,840
Sorry to spring this on you
at such short notice, sir.

904
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,240
- This is...
- General Voster.

905
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,720
Of the National Intelligence Service.

906
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,960
Previously known as the
Bureau of State Security.

907
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,280
Things in this country seem to be changing
so quickly, it almost astounds me.

908
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,240
I don't understand.

909
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,520
Tomorrow we'll be transferring you here

910
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,640
to take charge of Mandela
and four of his fellow prisoners.

911
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,160
You will be working with Brigadier Morkel,
directly under my command.

912
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,920
Yes?

913
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,880
They've just passed through the main gate.

914
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,080
We're going to be easing up
restrictions on visits,

915
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,440
mail, study time, newspapers, the lot.

916
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,720
Sir, I have a home in Plumstead. My wife
has a job there, my daughter's busy with...

917
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,040
You have nothing to worry about, James.

918
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:50,040
We have lots of accommodation for you here
and your family. Everything's sorted.

919
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,800
Why me?

920
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,720
You were the only warden from Robben
Island they never laid a charge against.

921
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,960
Not that that's a recommendation
in my book.

922
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,000
Go that way.

923
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,040
- It's been a long time, Nelson.
- Where are we, Mr. Gregory?

924
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,240
At Pollsmoor Maximum Security.

925
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,120
<i>- You still up?
- Yeah, Villages is on.</i>

926
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,840
What's happening? You want some tea?

927
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,560
I was going to ask you the same question.

928
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,240
Or would you prefer coffee?

929
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,120
- James!
- What?

930
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,440
- What happened at Pollsmoor?
- You won't believe it.

931
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,640
Well, maybe if you tell me, I will.

932
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,520
They've moved Mandela
and four of his comrades there.

933
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,360
I want tea, not coffee.

934
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,640
After 18 years on that bloody island.

935
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,120
So, what did they need you there for?

936
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,600
- They want to transfer me.
- Not again.

937
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,800
You'll be in the bloody car
three hours a day.

938
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,240
They want me on 24-hour notice
at the prison.

939
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,400
They've asked me to head up
the Mandela detail. Brent will be in it.

940
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,160
It'll be a whole new unit
under my command.

941
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,560
You can't decide something like this
without discussing it with me first.

942
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,680
They gave me no option.

943
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,040
Who's they?

944
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,640
General Voster, National Intelligence.

945
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,120
What about Natasha? Did you think of her?

946
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,880
She can take the train.
The train's a great place for her to study.

947
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,840
Gives her lots of time.

948
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,000
- Why did they move him?
- Because they're scared.

949
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,960
Can you imagine what would happen
if he died on that island?

950
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,480
There'd be a bloodbath.

951
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,560
- He could easily die in Pollsmoor.
- I don't know.

952
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,560
Maybe they're ready to start negotiating.

953
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,440
Don't be naive.
They don't negotiate with terrorists.

954
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,600
What? You think this can go on?

955
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,240
The country's going up in flames, man.
They bombed Joburg yesterday.

956
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,320
Next thing they'll blow up parliament,

957
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,200
then they'll start blowing up schools,
the railway stations.

958
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,440
But you think it's all right for Natasha
to catch the train every day?

959
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,880
Jesus, James.

960
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,520
Listen to me.

961
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,200
These last five years have probably been
the most boring of my life.

962
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,720
I go to that little office in Roeland Street,
and I open letters, and I read them,

963
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,040
then I fold them, put them back
and send them off. I need a change.

964
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,920
These could be extraordinary times.

965
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,760
I don't want to look back on my life
and say I stood on the sidelines.

966
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,760
This could be history in the making,

967
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,640
and I want to be a part of it.

968
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,880
It better be a house with a garden.

969
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,760
Thank you.

970
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,200
Chris, where does this lead?

971
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,000
It connects D-section with E.

972
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,160
- Secure it, I want it sealed off.
- I'll see to it.

973
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,240
Why is this man alone?

974
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,640
From now on, we work in pairs.
Two guards on each post.

975
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,920
Yes, sir.

976
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,360
Morning, gentlemen.

977
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,600
Mr. Gregory.

978
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:49,120
We are still waiting for an explanation.

979
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,880
- Well, I hear rumors.
- Rumors? What rumors?

980
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:59,560
They say you had too much influence
over the other prisoners on the island.

981
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,040
This is my son, Brent. He'll be assisting me.

982
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,200
- All in order?
- Yes, sir.

983
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,320
Chris.

984
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,080
- How far away is that mountain?
- About two miles.

985
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,000
Is it state owned or private?

986
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,320
I think it belongs to National Parks Board.

987
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,600
Find out.

988
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,160
How's it, Raymond?

989
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,920
- What's all the stuff doing outside?
- I'm putting it in storage.

990
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,440
How are you going to cut hair
without your table?

991
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,080
I've had a sign up outside for a week
and not one person's come.

992
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,240
They go to the mall for that kind of thing.

993
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,720
Besides, this place is too small.
You can hardly move in here.

994
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,280
It's a roof over our heads, Gloria.

995
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,520
You call this a roof?
I can hear the people bonking next door.

996
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,200
Where's Natasha?

997
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,920
She's sick of spending
half the day on the train.

998
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,800
She's going to stay over at my mom's
and visit on weekends.

999
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,720
Help me with the TV. I want it in the corner.

1000
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,280
Wait. Mind your back.

1001
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,040
Brent met Mandela
for the first time this morning.

1002
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,440
And?

1003
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,200
Yeah, I know, he said it was
like meeting an old uncle.

1004
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,240
<i>...have been deployed in Soweto</i>

1005
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,960
<i>to quell widespread violence and unrest</i>

1006
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:59,680
<i>sparked by demonstrators calling for the
unconditional release of Nelson Mandela.</i>

1007
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,440
<i>The spokesperson for
the South African police force</i>

1008
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,320
<i>said many arrests have been made, and the
situation had been brought under control.</i>

1009
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,920
Switch it off.

1010
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,440
- For your tomato plants.
- Thank you, Mr. Gregory.

1011
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,160
- And how are you, Brent?
- I'm fine, Mr. Mandela.

1012
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,600
That's good.

1013
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,960
Show me what
you're made of, Mr. Gregory.

1014
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:17,280
Defend yourself for I am a young ox.

1015
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,680
You are talking to a bull.

1016
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,680
Pa, what are you doing?

1017
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,320
Stand back, Brent.

1018
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,040
Come on, Warrant Officer.

1019
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,440
It seems you know more than
just our language, Mr. Gregory.

1020
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,600
Pa, where did you learn that? Pa?

1021
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,560
You should put some ice on it.

1022
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,320
It's not right.
Most of these people were civilians,

1023
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,440
ordinary people going about
their daily business!

1024
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,400
That's it, have a good look, man.
Have a good look!

1025
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,760
For goodness sake.
Hey man, hey man.

1026
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,560
In 1976, when the police opened fire
on Soweto school children,

1027
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,880
how many were left dead in the streets?
Thousands and thousands!

1028
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,120
Huh, what about those injured?

1029
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,400
And now you want to cry about 17 people?

1030
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,600
What is that, hey, get lost man!

1031
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,200
Wait, you knew me in '76, Raymond.

1032
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,600
Did I celebrate the death of those children

1033
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,040
with the rest of the warders
at Robben Island? Did I?

1034
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,400
I was horrified by it, horrified!

1035
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,760
This is also wrong!

1036
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,640
You could stop this.
You could put an end to this violence.

1037
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,920
How?

1038
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,800
Tell your people in Lusaka
to end the armed struggle.

1039
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,000
Mr. Gregory,

1040
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,800
do you honestly think that
if we laid down arms today,

1041
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,120
the apartheid regime would cease
their acts of violence against our people?

1042
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,840
It's a vicious circle.

1043
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,880
I have waited 20 years for your people
to come and talk to me about peace,

1044
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,360
but they are not interested in peace.
They are only interested in power.

1045
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,400
So are you.

1046
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,400
When those in power deny your freedom,

1047
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,440
the only path to freedom is power.

1048
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,920
Turn the TV, Pa. Botha's giving a speech.

1049
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,840
- Where's your mother?
- She took the car.

1050
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,840
She's got an interview at a new salon
opening up in Cape Town.

1051
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,440
She said she can't sit around
waiting for her life to restart.

1052
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,920
Good for her.

1053
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,760
<i>...people who put
pressure on South Africa,</i>

1054
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,200
<i>from outside and from within.</i>

1055
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:25,480
<i>I stated in Parliament that if
Mr. Mandela gives a commitment</i>

1056
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,320
<i>that he will not make
himself guilty of planning...</i>

1057
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,120
The guy can talk a lot of shit, eh, Pa?

1058
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,440
They're all the same.

1059
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,000
<i>...I will, in principle,
be prepared to consider his release.</i>

1060
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,560
<i>The choice is his.</i>

1061
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:48,040
<i>All that is required of him now
is that he should unconditionally</i>

1062
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,280
<i>reject violence as a political instrument.</i>

1063
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:57,040
<i>This is, after all, a norm which is expected
in all civilized countries of the world.</i>

1064
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,520
The presumption being
that South Africa is civilized.

1065
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,920
Here, James. This... No, sit down.
This just came from Pretoria.

1066
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,360
Would you believe it?

1067
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:22,160
You know, I think it's just some
public relations gesture.

1068
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,440
That won't be necessary.

1069
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,480
Where are we going today?

1070
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,960
You're meeting your family in the room
where you normally meet your lawyer.

1071
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,320
I do not understand.

1072
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,080
There'll be no more glass
between you and your visitors.

1073
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,120
I will be able to touch?

1074
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,200
Yes.

1075
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,600
Mr. Gregory,

1076
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,680
I have not touched my wife in 21 years.

1077
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,040
You'll be fine, Nelson.

1078
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,000
<i>My father says,</i>

1079
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,680
<i>"What freedom am I being offered</i>

1080
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,600
<i>"while the organization of the people
remains banned?</i>

1081
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,680
<i>"What freedom am I being offered</i>

1082
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,160
<i>"when I may be arrested on a pass offense?</i>

1083
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,840
<i>"What freedom am I being offered</i>

1084
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,120
<i>"to live my life as a family</i>

1085
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,480
<i>"with my dear wife,
who remains in banishment in Brandfort?</i>

1086
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,520
<i>"What freedom am I being offered... "
- She speaks very well, huh?</i>

1087
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,160
<i>"...when I must ask for permission</i>

1088
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,920
<i>- "to live in an urban area?"
- Not quite your regular terrorist, eh?</i>

1089
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,920
<i>"What freedom am I being offered</i>

1090
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,040
<i>"when I need a stamp on my pass
to seek work?</i>

1091
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,680
<i>"What freedom am I being offered</i>

1092
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,320
<i>"when my very South African citizenship
is not respected?</i>

1093
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:35,640
<i>"Only free men can negotiate.
Prisoners cannot enter into contracts. "</i>

1094
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,520
<i>My father says,</i>

1095
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,120
<i>"I cannot and will not give any undertaking</i>

1096
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,320
<i>"at a time when you, the people,
and I are not free.</i>

1097
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,400
<i>"Your freedom and mine
cannot be separated.</i>

1098
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,760
<i>"I will return."</i>

1099
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,960
Power to the people!

1100
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:19,240
Warrant Officer Gregory?
My name is Groenewald.

1101
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,280
I'd like you to consider me
for the Mandela detail.

1102
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,240
I'll get Personnel to send your file over.

1103
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:27,720
My wife's nephew lost his legs
in the Pretoria car bomb.

1104
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:32,080
It would be my pleasure to
return this kindness to Mandela.

1105
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,200
You must be joking.

1106
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:39,160
I'm not joking. I promise you, I'm not joking.

1107
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,560
Gloria!

1108
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,840
James!
Oh, James, where have you been?

1109
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,280
We had to isolate Mandela from the others.
What's wrong?

1110
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,680
A man phoned.

1111
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,680
He said they were going to kill Brent
and Natasha.

1112
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,960
He said we're Kaffir lovers
and we're all going to die.

1113
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,160
Do you recognize his voice?

1114
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:23,800
No, he said I was a fucking bitch,
and he said I was dead.

1115
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,520
- It's all right. It's okay.
- It's not okay, James!

1116
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,360
It's not okay. They want to kill my babies.

1117
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,960
Nothing is going to happen to you
or our family, okay?

1118
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,160
Brigadier Morkel, now.

1119
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,400
Brigadier, listen. Somebody phoned Gloria
and threatened to kill her and the kids.

1120
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,480
I want 24-hour protection on my family
or I'm off the job.

1121
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,080
<i>We'll take care of it.</i>

1122
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,800
- Major.
- Sir.

1123
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,720
Gregory's making noises
about resigning again.

1124
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,400
Give him what he wants.
Just keep him happy.

1125
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,200
It's a joke. Guarding the guard
who's guarding Mandela.

1126
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,640
We've got bigger problems.

1127
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,280
The international community are crying
for Mandela's release.

1128
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,960
They're putting more and more
pressure on us.

1129
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,400
- Are we going to bend?
- No.

1130
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,720
We're not going to give
power to the blacks ever.

1131
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:17,400
Besides, imagine if a right-wing bullet
takes him out.

1132
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,400
There'd be bloodshed like
this country's never seen.

1133
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,680
No, we'll have to make it
look like we're negotiating

1134
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,600
and give him access to his people.

1135
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:31,440
Maybe if we moved him to someplace
more comfortable, it would look better.

1136
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,240
Like where?

1137
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,360
The farm prison outside Paarl,
Victor Verster.

1138
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,560
It's got mountains, vineyards.

1139
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,480
<i>There's a farmhouse on the one side
which is isolated, secure.</i>

1140
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,200
Mr. Mandela's expecting you.

1141
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,840
Mr. Maharaj is a vegetarian,
so I'm not sure he'll appreciate the lamb.

1142
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,960
Well, I've baked a quiche for him.

1143
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,000
Don't serve wine to Mr. Ayob.
He's a Muslim.

1144
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,240
Christ, it's like the bloody
United Nations in there.

1145
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:28,400
The message from P.W. Botha is simple.
It's power sharing or nothing at all.

1146
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,880
We will not enter into any discussions

1147
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:37,120
unless all parties agree to
the principle of free and fair elections.

1148
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,840
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

1149
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:42,520
I'm taking the afternoon off.
If you need me, just speak to Chris.

1150
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,600
Very good, Mr. Gregory.

1151
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,560
Good day to you, gentlemen.

1152
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,400
This country's full of surprises.

1153
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,160
James, it's beautiful!

1154
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,000
What did I tell you? Look at the mountains.

1155
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,000
Come, let me show you inside.
How's my girl?

1156
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,360
This is so cool, Pa.

1157
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,960
Bring in the suitcases, Brent.

1158
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,360
- Wait.
- What?

1159
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,120
James!

1160
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,080
It's got a dishwasher, washing machine,
a spin dryer, the works.

1161
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,960
The kids have each got their own bedrooms
with study desks,

1162
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,040
and there's an extra TV
in the main bedroom.

1163
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,480
No!

1164
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,320
You don't believe me, go look for yourself.

1165
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:34,240
I promise you, we will not move from here
unless you decide to.

1166
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:42,400
Gloria, Gloria, you should be happy.
This is a new beginning, a new start.

1167
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,240
I'm happy. I'm happy. Thank you.

1168
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,360
Jeez, do you guys have to do that
in front of us?

1169
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,120
Come.

1170
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,880
- What do you think? In about an hour?
- You're not chilly?

1171
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,640
Oh, that's sweet.

1172
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,920
Damn it, I left my smokes in the car.
You go on. I'll catch you up in a minute.

1173
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,680
That's typically Pa.

1174
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,520
- Why you following me?
- Please, don't shoot.

1175
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,280
- Who are you?
- National Intelligence, top left jacket pocket.

1176
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,120
- Why?
- My orders are to look out

1177
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,480
for you and your family
whenever you leave the prison.

1178
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,520
Tell Jordaan next time send a professional.

1179
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:00,400
<i>Gregory's residence.</i>

1180
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,760
Hi, Natasha, it's me. Is Pa there?

1181
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,240
No, he just left. How did the exam go?

1182
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,320
<i>I cruised it, thanks to Mr. Mandela.</i>

1183
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:09,120
Everything he covered in commercial law
came up. He's amazing.

1184
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,280
- No, you must tell Ma.
- No, no, I will.

1185
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,840
Brent, drive carefully, okay?

1186
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:16,080
I will, I will. I'll see you later. Cheers, bye.

1187
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,680
- What time is it?
- Past 10:00.

1188
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,000
I must have drifted off.

1189
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,080
- Should I close up?
- Please.

1190
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,040
Is your family happy

1191
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,240
- with their new accommodation?
- Extremely.

1192
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,880
I saw on the television

1193
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:10,920
that President Botha suffered
a minor stroke.

1194
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,120
Do you know what hospital he's in?

1195
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,680
- I could find out.
- I would like to send him a bowl of fruit.

1196
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,880
And a card.

1197
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,160
Do you think he'd do the same for you?

1198
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:22,760
That is not relevant.

1199
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,840
I'll get Brent to find out.

1200
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,400
How is the young man?

1201
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,240
He finished his last exam.

1202
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,040
He should be driving back
from Cape Town as we speak.

1203
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,800
I am sure he will do very well.
Good night, Mr. Gregory.

1204
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:35,840
Good night, Madiba.

1205
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:41,440
This house is too big for one person.

1206
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,760
It needs a family, the sound of children.

1207
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,280
Hello?

1208
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,760
<i>Warrant Officer Gregory?
- Yes.</i>

1209
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,560
<i>This is Klapmuts Police Station.
Are you Warrant Officer Gregory?</i>

1210
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,000
I just told you I am.

1211
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,840
<i>Well, your son is dead.</i>

1212
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:20,560
What? Listen, this is no time for sick jokes.

1213
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:24,320
<i>Was your son driving a Ford
back from Cape Town this evening?</i>

1214
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,240
Yes.

1215
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:31,800
<i>Then he's dead. He was killed in a car crash.</i>

1216
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,200
What's wrong?

1217
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,880
- Brent is dead. He was killed in a car crash.
- What?

1218
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
What?

1219
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,360
It's because of everything I've done, Gloria.

1220
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:38,080
It's because of Thembi Mandela,
Oscar Ngidi, Jonas Motsadi, Diliza Mje,

1221
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:41,560
I sent those men to their deaths,
and now God is paying me back.

1222
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:45,960
- No, James, no. It's not your fault.
- I'm so sorry.

1223
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:50,760
It is. I sent those men to their deaths.
God forgive me! Please forgive me!

1224
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,200
We didn't know better, James.
We didn't know better.

1225
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:00,240
- Forgive me, please forgive me.
- It's not your fault, it's not your fault.

1226
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,440
Shh.

1227
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:34,760
<i>I was deeply shocked to hear of
the tragic death of your beloved son Brent.</i>

1228
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:42,120
<i>And on behalf of myself and my family,
I send you our sincerest sympathy.</i>

1229
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,440
<i>Few things are as painful
as an invisible wound.</i>

1230
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,880
<i>But I hope you and your family will be
comforted by the knowledge that Brent</i>

1231
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:56,280
<i>was loved and respected by almost all
those who came in contact with him.</i>

1232
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:00,880
<i>Once again, our deepest condolences.</i>

1233
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,720
James, you've got a visitor.

1234
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:13,680
James.

1235
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,080
General Voster called on
a number of occasions

1236
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:22,480
to offer his condolences,
but you don't come to the phone.

1237
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:27,240
I tell you, James, if you don't go
back to work, you will wither away.

1238
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,280
The results of his final exams.

1239
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,680
He passed everything, with distinction.

1240
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:38,240
First person in both our families
to get a university degree.

1241
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,720
Life goes on.

1242
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,240
It has to.

1243
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,120
You heard Botha resigned.

1244
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:54,120
This new man, de Klerk,
he's cut from different cloth.

1245
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,360
Please, man.

1246
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,160
We've been hearing talk of change for years
and nothing ever happens.

1247
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,360
This man is different. He's a listener.

1248
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:04,560
He's going to want
to meet Mandela face to face.

1249
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:07,960
And we're going to need you there, James,
to set it up.

1250
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:32,880
Do you remember once telling me
you didn't want to be on the sidelines,

1251
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,800
that you wanted to be part of history?

1252
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,520
We need to be strong, James,
for each other,

1253
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:51,040
for Natasha, for whatever the future
holds for us in this bloody country.

1254
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,280
It's nice to see you back again, sir.
I've got tea on the stove, if you want.

1255
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,560
I'm fine.

1256
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:34,160
Come, my friend.
Let us take a walk in the garden.

1257
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:43,000
Time will heal physical wounds,
but time will not heal invisible wounds.

1258
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,880
Sometimes, even now, I think of Thembi.

1259
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,440
In some ways, I don't think I have
ever stopped thinking about him.

1260
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,960
Madiba...

1261
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,880
What is it, Mr. Gregory?

1262
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:59,280
I told the security police
that Thembi had a license to get a car.

1263
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,800
I told them.

1264
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:05,520
Because I heard Winnie telling you.

1265
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:11,920
Do you honestly believe that the security
police did not know that before you did?

1266
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,480
There are other names, other people that I...

1267
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,440
Mr. Gregory,
we all have our jobs to do in this life.

1268
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:25,200
You cannot allow guilt or bitterness
to cloud your way forward.

1269
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,320
Come, I have something for you
to give to Gloria, from me.

1270
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,240
That was given to him by his mother.

1271
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:45,360
He says winter is coming
and you need to keep warm.

1272
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:47,360
That's very kind of him.

1273
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,520
Can you believe that in all these years,
I have never once laid eyes on him?

1274
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,680
I don't even know what he looks like.

1275
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,320
Merry Christmas.

1276
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,520
Happy Christmas, Gloria.

1277
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,080
No moping, you two. Please.

1278
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,800
Make a toast, Pa.

1279
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:25,240
To a new South Africa.

1280
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,920
- To South Africa.
- To South Africa.

1281
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,160
How do I look?

1282
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:48,600
You cannot visit the President with a tie
that looks like a hangman's noose. Here.

1283
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,440
You will appreciate
it has been 20 years since I've worn a tie.

1284
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:24,680
You're looking very elegant, Mr. Mandela.

1285
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,720
- Thank you.
- Please follow me.

1286
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,080
The President is waiting for you.

1287
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,080
Stay here, Chris.

1288
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:40,720
Why is it I am not surprised
to see you here?

1289
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,120
It's over.

1290
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,800
I could have told you that long ago.

1291
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,760
They're releasing him on Sunday.

1292
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,240
You will be in charge of his personal safety

1293
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:50,320
until he walks out of the gates
of Victor Verster.

1294
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:53,120
You've done a good job, Gregory.
Well done.

1295
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,440
Tell me the truth.

1296
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,840
Thembi's accident, was it murder?

1297
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:05,880
No, not even I know that.

1298
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,080
Take a seat in the lounge, Brigadier.
Mr. Mandela won't be long.

1299
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:34,160
- Is Warrant Officer Gregory here?
- He's helping Mr. Mandela pack, sir.

1300
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,440
<i>There is a clear sign of movement</i>

1301
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:43,280
<i>over beyond the higher trees,
the helicopters...</i>

1302
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,800
<i>Quite a number of helicopters circling above
the Victor Verster Prison.</i>

1303
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,320
<i>Excitement in the crowd, movement...</i>

1304
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,680
Good morning, Brigadier.
What brings you out here?

1305
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:55,120
I'm here to officially release you.

1306
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,240
Sign here.

1307
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:16,040
Mr. Mandela, I'm giving you
a copy of this release form

1308
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:19,120
in case someone wants to arrest you
for escaping.

1309
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:25,280
Warrant Officer Gregory, your insignia.
Take them off.

1310
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,720
What?

1311
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,440
Your insignia, off.

1312
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,920
Congratulations, Lieutenant Gregory.

1313
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,480
Thank you, sir.

1314
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,880
I guess I will now have to
show you some respect.

1315
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,640
It's a bit late for that, Madiba.

1316
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,880
- So how does it feel?
- What?

1317
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,440
Being a free man, after 27 years.

1318
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,160
It will take some time to sink in.

1319
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,920
I understand.

1320
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,480
I've been wanting to give you something,
but I couldn't think what.

1321
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,200
This was given to me by a friend,

1322
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:44,680
the one who taught me to
stick fight better than you.

1323
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,600
Are you challenging me, Mr. Gregory?

1324
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:48,600
Because if you are, we can step outside.

1325
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:49,840
No, no.

1326
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,840
It has protected me for many years.

1327
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,880
I hope it does the same for you.

1328
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:06,600
Thank you, Mr. Gregory.

1329
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,360
<i>You join us
at the Victor Verster Prison,</i>

1330
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,240
<i>where the excitement is running high.</i>

1331
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:33,160
<i>The helicopters circling above.</i>

1332
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:35,440
<i>The first cars coming out.</i>

1333
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:43,600
<i>And Mr. Nelson Mandela will,
within seconds... Within seconds appear</i>

1334
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:47,720
<i>and that will be the moment
the world has been waiting for.</i>

1335
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:51,600
<i>Mr. Mandela who has grayed,</i>

1336
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,960
<i>a man who has been in prison
for nearly three decades,</i>

1337
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:03,360
<i>would be appearing in public,
for the first time, any moment now.</i>

1338
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:08,080
<i>There's Mr. Mandela, Mr. Nelson Mandela,</i>

1339
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:13,360
<i>a free man, taking his first steps
into a new South Africa.</i>

1340
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:21,480
Mr. Mandela! Mr. Mandela!

1341
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,560
<i>Mrs. Winnie Mandela
next to him, waving to the crowds,</i>

1342
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:36,960
<i>hand in hand.</i>

1343
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,680
"There shall be peace and friendship.

1344
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:47,120
"Let all who love their people and
their country now say, as we say here,

1345
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:50,320
"these freedoms we will fight for,
side by side,

1346
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:54,000
"throughout our lives,
until we have won our liberty."

1347
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:02,960
<i>That is the man who the world
has been waiting to see,</i>

1348
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:08,080
<i>walking strongly, step by step,
further into freedom.</i>

1349
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,920
Goodbye, Bafana.
