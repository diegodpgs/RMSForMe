00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:53,020
The Swedish student was one
thing, but this was something
completely different.

315
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,522
The smiles on the girls' faces
and the total lack of shyness

316
00:31:56,523 --> 00:32:00,027
about what they were showing the
camera was so confusing for me.

317
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:05,031
I had never seen the female part
up close and in so much detail.

318
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:07,534
I guess I imagined something neater,

319
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:11,037
like a smooth hole drilled into a piece of wood.

320
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,040
The sort of hole where you
might place a wooden peg.

321
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:17,543
But the reality was much more
sexually aggressive.

322
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:20,046
It was hard to imagine that
my teacher, Mrs. booth,

323
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:23,549

that looked just like it.

[Ben]
A Natalie was a term that Sean had
coined for any sexual encounter

331
00:32:58,418 --> 00:33:01,420
that happened with a girl you
weren't in a relationship with.

The term had come from a girl
called Natalie who lived
across the street from Sean.

- Hello. Is Natalie in?
- Yeah. Natalie!

- Yeah?
- It's for you.

[Ben]
You see, Sean had
worked out the connection

338
00:33:24,444 --> 00:33:27,446
between the smiling faces
of the girls in the magazines

339
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:30,450

I wanted to freeze time.

I wanted to savor that moment.

To live in that moment for a week.

379

But I couldn't stop it.

Crush.

395
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:35,254
It's funny how the same word
for the feeling of attraction

396
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:37,257
can be used for the feeling of disappointment.

397
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:41,260
The Oxford English dictionary
states one of the meanings
for the word crushed

398
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:45,265
as "a strong and unreasoning,
but transitory attachment."

[Tv announcer]

400
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:50,269
I had three crushes when I was young.

401
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,772
The first was an athlete called Zola Budd.

402
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:56,776
She was 18, and looked like a tomboy
with a small, slender frame.

403
00:38:57,277 --> 00:39:00,279
But it was the fact that Zola Budd
defiantly ran barefoot

404
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,283
that made her so completely attractive for me.

405
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:08,788
It was the Los Angeles Olympics
that would go down in history.

406
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:14,293
In the 3,000 meter race,
Zola Budd clashed with
the American, Mary Decker.

407
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:17,297
Budd's heart for the race
was left where Decker fell.

408
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:21,800
Zola finished seventh.

Can somebody tell me something about
the white blood cells? Tim?

412

Uh, they help fight off bacteria
and germs in the body.

The second crush was for my
Biology teacher, Mrs. booth.

417
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:51,830
Okay, class, who can tell me
something about cells?

418

[Ben]
She was a confident woman
whose figure-hugging outfits

419
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:57,336
hinted at the sexiness that lay hidden beneath.

420
00:39:57,337 --> 00:40:00,840
I imagined Mrs. booth asking me
to stay behind after school

00:40:01,341 --> 00:40:03,842
and showing me the same thing under her skirt

as the girls I'd seen
in the magazines with Sean.

But the main crush I had was
with a girl called Tanya green.

Tanya had broken her arm falling from a swing,

432

and her cast had caused much excitement
amongst the other kids at the school.

But I saw it differently.

436

It was the way Tanya dealt with it.

The way she scratched an itch.

But while the other kids joked
and called her "monkey,"

It was just behind the school.

00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:52,070
The familiar building,
so unfamiliar in its quietness.

473
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:55,074
Peaceful, as if time had frozen still.

474
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:12,591
[Mrs. booth]
It's like the walls of this room.

475
00:44:12,592 --> 00:44:14,593
It keeps the whole building standing.

476
00:44:14,594 --> 00:44:19,598
[Ben]
Tanya's parents had taken her on
a surprise holiday to America.

477
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,101
They set up home there, and never returned.

478
00:44:22,602 --> 00:44:26,606
It was the first time my heart
felt the other meaning of crush.

479
00:44:35,615 --> 00:44:37,616
Checkmate.

480
00:44:37,617 --> 00:44:41,119
What's wrong with you?
You normally kick my arse at chess.

481
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,623
Have you met someone?

482
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,126
Well, come on.
Give me the juice.

483
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:51,631
No, it's nothing really.
Just a girl at work I think is nice.

484
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:55,133
Nice? Nice what?
Nice rack?

485
00:44:55,134 --> 00:44:57,636
No.

486
00:44:57,637 --> 00:44:59,638
Well, yeah, but nothing like that.

487
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:03,141
What?
Girlfriend material?

488
00:45:03,142 --> 00:45:05,644
She got small hands?

489
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:08,647
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Makes your Willy look big.

490
00:45:08,648 --> 00:45:11,149
You're such a loser.

491
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,651
So have you asked her out?

492
00:45:12,652 --> 00:45:16,154
- No. Someone already beat me to it.
- Ahh, she got a boyfriend.

493
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:19,157
No, but one of the guys at work
asked her out. She said "yes."

494
00:45:19,158 --> 00:45:21,159
They're going to the pictures tonight.

495
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,662
That doesn't mean she fancies him.

496
00:45:23,663 --> 00:45:27,667
She might just like him, and want
someone to go to pictures with.

497
00:45:29,669 --> 00:45:32,672
How many girls have you taken to
the pictures and then snogged?

498
00:45:35,174 --> 00:45:37,677
- Oh, yeah!
- [Screams]

499
00:45:44,684 --> 00:45:48,187
- [Gasps]
- What?

500
00:45:49,689 --> 00:45:51,690
Quite a few.

501
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:53,693
There you go.

502
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:58,698
[Beeping noise]

503
00:45:59,198 --> 00:46:00,199
Can I have that?

504
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,702
[Chuckling]

505
00:46:04,704 --> 00:46:07,706
Yeah, yeah, that's right, Rory.

506
00:46:07,707 --> 00:46:12,210
Well, of course I played
professionally, before the injury.

507
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:13,712
Any day, Rory.

508
00:46:13,713 --> 00:46:18,216
You name the date, me and my boys'll be there.

509
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:21,219
All right. Sunday.

510
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:25,725
Just don't go crying to your mama.

511
00:46:29,228 --> 00:46:31,229
- Ciao.
- Whatever.

512
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,732
Tosser.

513
00:46:38,237 --> 00:46:40,238
Game on.

514
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,741
2,000 Feet jump.

515
00:46:42,742 --> 00:46:46,245
Can't beat it. 3,000, kill ya.

516
00:47:05,264 --> 00:47:07,266
There he is!

517
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:10,268
So, how'd it go with Sharon?

518
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:12,271
- Oh, mate!
- So, did ya?

519
00:47:12,772 --> 00:47:15,273
Of course I did.
She loved it.

520
00:47:15,274 --> 00:47:20,278
Couldn't get enough of it.
She went like the toilet door
on a Bombay shrimp trawler.

521
00:47:20,279 --> 00:47:22,781
- Rack?
- Well, put it this way.

522
00:47:22,782 --> 00:47:25,283
At least you know your kids
will never go hungry.

523
00:47:25,284 --> 00:47:27,285
And?

524
00:47:27,286 --> 00:47:29,789
Like an artist's pocket.

525
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:36,294
Okay, champs.
Rory Brown.

526
00:47:36,295 --> 00:47:38,296
Manager of Sainsbury's, Islington,

527
00:47:38,297 --> 00:47:41,800
has challenged us to a football
match on Sunday night.

528
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:43,802
[Everyone groaning]

529
00:47:43,803 --> 00:47:45,804
Finished?

530
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:47,806
Good.

531
00:47:47,807 --> 00:47:50,809
The reputation of this supermarket is at stake.

532
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,814
Your reputations, as employees, are at stake.

533
00:47:56,315 --> 00:47:58,316
This is not just a game of football.

534
00:47:58,317 --> 00:48:01,821
This is what it means to
be a modern-day gladiator!

535
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:07,325
Now, I want you to think of me as Russell Crowe.

536
00:48:07,326 --> 00:48:10,829
And you, you're all the other slaves.

537
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:15,333
And as slaves, you will play to the death!

538
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:19,839
For what happens on Sunday night,
will echo through eternity.

539
00:48:24,844 --> 00:48:29,348
Sunday. 8:00 P.M. Sunny Sports Center.

540
00:48:42,361 --> 00:48:45,364
You have got to got to be joking, right?

541
00:48:47,867 --> 00:48:50,369
We're gonna get murdered.

542
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,371
[Exhales]

543
00:48:53,372 --> 00:48:55,875
Aaah!

544
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,882
- Hi.
- [Man] All right.

545
00:49:03,883 --> 00:49:05,884
Ah, bollocks!

546
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:09,387
- Playing on this right wing.
Like a train, I am.
- Hiya.

547
00:49:09,388 --> 00:49:10,890
[Man]
Heads up!

548
00:49:14,894 --> 00:49:17,896
Gather round, Whitechapel.
Whitechapel, gather round.

549
00:49:17,897 --> 00:49:21,399
Okay, chaps, this is it!

550
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,403
That is Islington Sainsbury's over there.

551
00:49:24,904 --> 00:49:29,407
All I can see are a lot of pretty uniforms.

552
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:31,910
Take a good look at one another.

553
00:49:31,911 --> 00:49:34,412
Why?

554
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:37,416
Natural-born killers!
Every one of you!

555
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:41,921
So let's get stuck in there
and settle this! Huh? Huh?

556
00:49:42,421 --> 00:49:44,924
Huh?
[Growling]

557
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:51,430
[Cheers]

558
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:57,937
Hey, Barry, I've got this really great game.

559
00:49:58,437 --> 00:49:59,438
All right, Rory.

560
00:49:59,939 --> 00:50:01,439
Jenkins.

561
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,442
There's some pretty uniforms you boys got.

562
00:50:04,443 --> 00:50:08,447
See you've brought your top team this time.

563
00:50:11,951 --> 00:50:14,452
Looks can be deceiving.

564
00:50:14,453 --> 00:50:18,456
- Well, that's obvious.
- What?

565
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:21,960
Right. Call.

566
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:24,462
Heads.
No, tails.

567
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:27,966
Tails it is.

568
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,970
[Blows whistle]
Come along!

569
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:40,478
[Rory]
We've got one goal.

570
00:50:40,479 --> 00:50:42,982
All right.
Get in your spaces.

571
00:50:46,986 --> 00:50:49,488
- Ahh!
- Look at that!

572
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:54,492
[Blows whistle]

573
00:50:54,493 --> 00:50:56,995
[Players shouting]

574
00:50:56,996 --> 00:50:58,497
[Sharon]
Get it!

575
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:03,002
Come on, take it, come on!

576
00:51:08,507 --> 00:51:10,509
[Player]
Come on, after it.

577
00:51:15,514 --> 00:51:17,516
[Cell phone ringing]

578
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:25,523
I'm playing! I'm playing!
The safe keys are hanging off,
on the top shelf!

579
00:51:25,524 --> 00:51:28,527
[Sharon]
Get it! Get it!

580
00:51:33,032 --> 00:51:35,534
[Spits]
What?

581
00:51:38,537 --> 00:51:41,040
Triangles!
Triangles!

582
00:51:44,043 --> 00:51:46,044
- Foul!
- [Referee] No foul! Play on!

583
00:51:46,045 --> 00:51:48,546
Play on, my ass!

584
00:51:48,547 --> 00:51:50,548
I'm all right!

585
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:54,053
I'm all right!
I'm all right!

586
00:51:55,054 --> 00:51:57,555
[Blows whistle]
What are you doing?

587
00:51:57,556 --> 00:52:00,058
Grow up.
Forget about the money.

588
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,060
What money?
What are you doing?

589
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:05,564
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty
phone is what I'm doing.

590
00:52:06,065 --> 00:52:08,066
'Cause there's a dead
man on the other end
of this fucking line!

591
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:12,570
- I love that film!
- Pachino. Didn't you hear though?

592
00:52:12,571 --> 00:52:16,074
You oughta see the bank job shootout
scene on me plasma screen!

593
00:52:16,075 --> 00:52:18,076
[Blows whistle]

594
00:52:18,077 --> 00:52:21,579
Come on, Whitechapel, we can still win this.

595
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,582
- [Jenkins] Come on, lads!
- Shoot!

596
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:27,586
- [Shouting]
- Aye! Dipstick!

597
00:52:28,087 --> 00:52:28,587
Sorry!

598
00:52:32,591 --> 00:52:34,593
The ball, the ball, the ball, the ball!

599
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:40,099
For the love of God!

600
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:44,603
[Player shouting]

601
00:52:46,105 --> 00:52:48,107
[Jenkins]
Yeah! Finally!

602
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:52,611
[Player]
Oh, my lord!
Get a life, dipstick!

603
00:52:56,115 --> 00:52:58,116
Time out, ref.
Time out.

[Blows whistle]

605
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,623
Well, chaps, could be worse.

606
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:08,126
How could it be worse?
It's 26-nil.

607
00:53:08,127 --> 00:53:10,128
It doesn't matter.

608
00:53:10,129 --> 00:53:14,632
What matters is,
there's less than a minute to play.

609
00:53:14,633 --> 00:53:18,637
And we are not leaving this pitch
until we score a goal!

610
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,643
Matt, get the ball to Ben.

611
00:53:26,645 --> 00:53:30,149
Ben, this is your moment.

612
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,652
I need you.

613
00:53:34,153 --> 00:53:35,654
Get your little legs.

614
00:53:36,155 --> 00:53:40,158
Run up that right flank like
the devil were after you.

615
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,662
I'll be in the center waiting for your cross.

616
00:53:44,663 --> 00:53:47,165
Use Barry if you need to.

617
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:49,668
Matt, stay on my left flank.

618
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,671
I need that cross.

619
00:53:53,672 --> 00:53:55,674
I need that ball

620
00:53:56,175 --> 00:53:58,177
here.

621
00:53:59,678 --> 00:54:01,679
I'll take the shot.

622
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,685
And we, we will share the glory.

623
00:54:07,686 --> 00:54:09,687
- Got it?
- Yeah.

624
00:54:09,688 --> 00:54:11,689
Now let's score a goal!

625
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:15,693
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

626

Come on, boys, come on!

[Blows whistle]

628
00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:23,262
No!

629
00:55:39,278 --> 00:55:41,279
[Ben]
I often wonder what it would be like

630
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,781
to spend the rest of my life
with the world on pause.

631
00:55:43,782 --> 00:55:47,785
To live out the rest of my life between
