1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,952
- Hello?
<i>- Sonny, it's your dad. You asleep?</i>

2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,078
No. Hey, man. I was exercising.

3
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,669
<i>- Bullshit. You were sleeping.</i>
- I wasn't.

4
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,151
<i>This kid won't stop lying to me.</i>
<i>You still act like you're six.</i>

5
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,597
<i>Yeah, okay, Dad.</i>
<i>I act like I'm six.</i>

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,473
<i>Found a job yet, where</i>
<i>you work more than one day a week?</i>

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,914
<i>I've been looking.</i>

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,789
<i>Looking won't pay the rent.</i>

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,349
<i>All the money I won</i>
<i>from the cab accident...</i>

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,909
<i>... is kicking ass</i>
<i>in the stock market, so relax.</i>

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,628
<i>- Don't blow it on worthless crap.</i>
<i>- I won't.</i>

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,748
<i>You should spend it on your bar exam.</i>

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,560
<i>You're the lawyer.</i>
<i>I ain't taking a bar exam.</i>

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,677
<i>I got too much other shit going on.</i>

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,996
<i>I don't know what happened to you.</i>

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,152
<i>How're things going with</i>
<i>your girlfriend, Vanessa?</i>

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,549
Things are going fine.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,068
Shit!

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,270
I gotta go.

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,034
Shit! You turned off
the alarm clock again.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,989
No! I mean, yes, I did,
but I thought you needed more sleep.

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,550
I shouldn't have stayed here.
That was a jerk thing to do.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,268
Why are you going to work?
It's Sunday.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,115
I'm not going to work. I'm going to
brunch with potential clients.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,796
That's how a party planner
gets business, by making contacts.

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,157
Meet with me. I'll order in
from Cozy's. We'll have fun.

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,995
I am sick of Cozy's.
You order in from there all the time.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,753
The delivery guy's your best friend.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,070
He happens to be pretty damn nice.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,038
This is a rough patch in my life.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,670
Syracuse is 0 and 3.
And I got those medical problems.

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,909
Medical problems?

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,630
A cab runs over your foot two years ago.
You're hospitalized one night.

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,677
First of all, that cab was huge.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,833
And a jury decided that one night
of pain was worth $200,000.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,911
- So there you go.
- Whatever.

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,310
Why are you being
so nuts to me lately?

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,274
You refuse to move on
to the next phase.

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,278
I'd like to have a family someday.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,080
I need someone I can rely on,
not a playmate.

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,477
You need a father figure?
"Stop pulling your sister's hair!"

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,231
You know what? I'm gonna go to
Syracuse to see my mom.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,073
- I'll be back on Wednesday.
- What are you talking about?

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,959
I had call for delivery, but it was
crank call. You want chocolate cake?

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,634
Come back later.
I'll Indian wrestle you.

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,074
You're going down, sucker.

47
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,309
We'll see about that.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,596
Okay. Peace, out.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,672
You're going to Syracuse?

50
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,672
I need time to think and so do you.

51
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,909
Think about what?

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,674
Your life and why I should
be a part of it.

53
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,676
All right.

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,071
While you're at it,
think about getting a real job.

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,197
I got a real job!

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,551
Patrick Ewing, nice shot.

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,834
- Hey, Sonny.
- What's up, buddy boy?

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,071
I'm out the door. Hey, pal.

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,712
- Where you going?
- Manhattan.

60
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,439
You wanna take me with you?

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,750
All right, I guess.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,718
Hold onto your money.
Later on.

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,393
Okay, take care, Sonny.

64
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,995
See you.

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,317
Cadillac, I love it.

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,079
Surprise!

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,958
Just ignore him.

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,000
It's only Sonny. It's only Sonny.

69
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,515
Yeah, it's only me. It's only me.

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,078
- What's going on?
- Corinne's going-away party for Kevin.

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,039
She didn't tell me.
The roommate has a right to know.

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,396
She knew you'd ruin the surprise.

73
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,629
No, I wouldn't.

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,155
Hey, surprise.

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,589
Surprise.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,989
What's going on?

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,712
We wasted the good surprise on you.

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,109
All right.

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,429
Is this your handiwork?

80
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,238
I guess.

81
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,272
See you in three hours.

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,829
Good to see you stiffs.
What've you been doing?

83
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,709
Last three weeks have been crazy.
I've been in Denver, Dallas...

84
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,509
I'm sleeping in the office.
We're going to trial on the fraud case.

85
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,593
Honey, it was a great surprise.
I was totally shocked.

86
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,071
No, you weren't!
And I worked so hard on this.

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,594
Need some help?

88
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,035
- Honey, your sister's here.
- Hey, sweetie.

89
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,111
I hate Sonny.

90
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,909
My client's out $7 million. All we
can sue on is breach of contract.

91
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,391
Maybe you can sue under
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,673
I gotta get back to the office.
You're the king.

93
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,319
Mikey, a pleasure.

94
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,676
- I'll see you at home.
- All right.

95
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,268
I'll walk you out.

96
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,113
I gotta admit, I'm still
weirded out when they kiss.

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,794
Why? They're gay.
That's what gay guys do.

98
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,589
I know, but they were like
brothers to us back in school.

99
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,071
They're still like our brothers.
Our very, very gay brothers.

100
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,072
What are you doing after this?
Going to a Klan meeting?

101
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,709
Remember when Dad had that barbecue
for his friends and it rained...

102
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,076
...so he and Mom went into the
kitchen and made...

103
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,278
...100 hamburgers with one frying pan?

104
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,556
You're not gonna let a little rain
stop you from making 100 hamburgers.

105
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,314
That relationship's lasted longer
than I thought it would.

106
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,712
Look at his eyes. He's bored.
I give it two more weeks.

107
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,235
Hey, excuse me. Everybody!

108
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,992
I'm sorry. I wanted to thank you
for coming tonight.

109
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,559
I guess I should say...

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,276
I'm getting it.

111
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,832
Tomorrow I'm leaving for China to
represent the firm of Morton and Mandel.

112
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,755
Me, the same guy who once shaved
his ass to win a $5 bet.

113
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,839
Prove it!

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,075
Just kidding.

115
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,676
But I am real glad you're all here
tonight, because...

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,673
...I'm gonna do what I never thought
I'd have the guts to do.

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,913
You're not proposing, are you?

118
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,516
Yeah, pal, I am.

119
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,751
Well, think about it, you know?

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,353
God, Sonny, shut up!

121
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,398
Anyway, will you?

122
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,554
Yeah.

123
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,712
Good call on the two weeks.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,592
Sonny, what was that all about?

125
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,991
Congratulations. You and
"Big Boobs" McGee are gonna be happy.

126
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,593
Don't call her that.

127
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,833
You wanna tell your children you met
their mother as a waitress at Hooters?

128
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,958
Sonny, that was five years ago.
She's a doctor now...

129
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,191
...and my fiancée, so from now on...

130
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,953
...Dr. Big Boobs McGee.

131
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,395
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

132
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,312
I just...

133
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,678
...got shit going on.

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,909
What's the matter?

135
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,390
Vanessa's gonna break up with me...

136
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,074
...and I don't know how
to make her wanna stay.

137
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,550
She's getting older.
She wants different things:

138
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,678
Career, stable relationship, a family.

139
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,989
That's how they get.

140
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,993
I want things to go back
to the way they used to be.

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,674
When we were at Syracuse,
and Vanessa worshiped you.

142
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,354
- That was nice.
- Nobody hassled you to get a job.

143
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,318
Tommy and Phil showered separately.

144
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,874
Those were the days.

145
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,159
- What're you doing?
- lf I make this...

146
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,755
...Vanessa will realize
she likes me the way I am.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,274
You're going to the putt.

148
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,631
Remember, the roof breaks
to the right.

149
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,717
Yes! That's what I'm talk...

150
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,154
Good God!

151
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,753
That can't be good.

152
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,029
Where's Kevin?

153
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,154
He already left. I guess
he forgot to say goodbye to you.

154
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,597
- Why are you here?
- I'm cleaning because you're useless.

155
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,354
Then what, you gonna go to
your Hooters reunion?

156
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,956
You guys talk about whose ass
hangs out of their shorts the most?

157
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,709
At least I can fit my ass
in my shorts, fatty.

158
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,718
Speaking of fatty, whose is this?

159
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,235
- I don't know.
- I'm eating it then.

160
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,675
"We wasted the good surprise on you."

161
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,318
Lady gave me $5 to bring him here.

162
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,073
- What do you mean?
- Later.

163
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,717
Are you selling raffle tickets?

164
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,755
Oh, boy.

165
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,914
- Kevin Gerrity.
<i>- I got something to tell you.</i>

166
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,956
What's up?

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,155
There's a kid here.

168
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,389
What kind of kid?

169
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,790
If this note is true, it's your kid.

170
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,189
What do you mean?

171
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,871
I'm having a tough time
reading this...

172
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,078
...but it says, "Dear Kevin:
This is Julian, your son.

173
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,880
I hope you understand why
I didn't tell you until now...

174
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,635
<i>... but he needs your help.</i>
<i>I can't be his mother anymore."</i>

175
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,552
- This is ridiculous.
<i>- Hang on.</i>

176
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,714
Who's this?

177
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,191
This is my friend.

178
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,559
- Is that Kevin on the phone?
- No, it's my Uncle Remus.

179
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,039
What's your name?

180
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,589
Is he all right?

181
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,592
He doesn't like you.
Leave us alone.

182
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,114
You're such a dick.

183
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,158
That was your girlfriend.
She was acting "Hooterific."

184
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,913
Who sent that note?

185
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,990
"Jan."

186
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,073
Jan...
I don't know any Jan.

187
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,151
<i>- Where's he from?</i>
- Where are you from?

188
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,355
Buffalo.

189
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,556
I've never even been to Buffalo.

190
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,358
Maybe it's a mistake.

191
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,398
Is this like the time
you said my parents were dead?

192
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,153
I swear, he's right here.

193
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,479
I'm coming home.
I don't know what I'll say...

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,755
Hang on. It says...

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,073
..."If you won't take responsibility
for him, they found a foster family..."

196
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,312
Yes, Uncle Remus,
I know the catfish are huge.

197
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,675
<i>That's terrific.</i>

198
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,959
Here's a number for a guy...

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,794
<i>... at City Social Service.</i>
<i>Arthur Brooks. I'll call.</i>

200
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,996
<i>- I'll come home.</i>
- I'll take care of it.

201
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,195
Are you sure?

202
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,475
Yeah, don't worry.

203
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,633
Hooters. Hooters. Hooters!

204
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,836
- All right. Thanks a lot.
<i>- Later.</i>

205
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,677
I'm gonna make another phone call.

206
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,310
You want to come and sit down, pal?

207
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,551
Or you can stand there.
Anything you want. I'll be a minute.

208
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,354
<i>Social Services</i>
<i>is closed today, Columbus Day.</i>

209
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,875
<i>We'll be open tomorrow at 8 a.m.</i>

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,157
Columbus Day.

211
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,991
Boy, I don't know what to tell you.

212
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,470
Everything's gonna get
figured out tomorrow.

213
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,029
Can you be a tough little guy
until then?

214
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,949
Great.

215
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,917
Do I need to get you a bottle
of formula or something?

216
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,469
What do you eat?

217
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,994
Food.

218
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,231
Yeah? I eat food too.

219
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,551
What..? Come on.

220
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,158
You need me to hold your hand?

221
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,154
On Mondays, I go to Central Park
and watch rollerbladers fall down.

222
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,436
- You into that?
- I don't know.

223
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,918
Watch. This guy's humming.

224
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,152
He's going down, he's going down,
he's going..!

225
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,714
How old are you, anyways?

226
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,359
Five.

227
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,753
You wear a diaper?

228
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,471
You wipe your own ass then?

229
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,915
You do? Good job. That's cool.

230
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,518
Come on, fall down. Fall down. Yes!
Come on, damn it.

231
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,318
You suck. You suck!

232
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,793
Check this out.

233
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,075
My God!

234
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,153
There's a stick there.
Somebody should move it.

235
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,358
<i>All right now, what way</i>
<i>would you put that on?</i>

236
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,909
This Columbo, he pretends
to be stupid...

237
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,872
...but he's really smart as a tack.

238
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,314
Oh, yeah, he is.

239
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,348
<i>You put the vane on down there.</i>
<i>Then this boat comes up.</i>

240
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,556
I wipe my own ass.

241
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,713
Me too.

242
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,838
So, Mr. Ass Wiper,
what's this guy's name?

243
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,633
Scuba Steve.

244
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,871
Does he ever take his flippers off?

245
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,755
What if he goes bowling?

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,958
They don't make him wear bowling shoes?
He wears flippers?

247
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,996
Really?

248
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,276
I had a doll like that at one time.

249
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,954
But my cat, he bite his head off.

250
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,474
What cat would do that?

251
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,709
You calling me a liar?

252
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,598
Hey, take it easy.

253
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,949
Anyways...

254
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,918
...Jets are playing tonight.

255
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,833
We're gonna go to the Blarney Stone.
Wanna come?

256
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,513
I've got more deliveries.

257
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,274
Maybe you can also finish
the turkey on your lip.

258
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,669
Right there.

259
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,999
<i>Let's crank up the Styx.</i>

260
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,798
No music during the game.

261
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,077
- It's halftime. Relax, Mr. Herlihy.
- Goddamn Jets.

262
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,151
What are you doing in here, cutie?

263
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,193
Watching football.

264
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,238
- Who do you want to win?
- The goddamn Jets.

265
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,032
Have fun.

266
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,079
Too bad you don't like girls.
I think you could've had her.

267
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,550
- I'm thirsty.
- You're thirsty?

268
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,438
Are you allowed soda?

269
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,476
I don't know.

270
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,597
My mom always said
soda rots your teeth...

271
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,035
...but you'll lose them
anyway, so rot on.

272
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,636
- Can we get two root beers?
- Sure.

273
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,758
When I graduated law school, we met
here every Monday to watch football.

274
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,393
Who would meet you?

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,399
My friends, Vanessa.

276
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,959
Vanessa always rooted against the team
I wanted to win just to bust my chops.

277
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,636
But everybody's so busy with
their crap lately, no one comes.

278
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,598
Like I'm not busy?

279
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,071
Shut up or I'll smack you
through the wall like last Monday.

280
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,392
Last Monday was a fluke.
Bring it on, woman.

281
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,710
Anytime.

282
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,719
He drinks a lot of soda.

283
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,869
I'm telling you, buddy. Vanessa,
she's the one. I can't lose her.

284
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,838
I'm not getting any handsomer.

285
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,550
Every day I get a little bit older
and balder and fatter.

286
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,516
Fatter?

287
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,991
At your age I could eat anything.
Wouldn't gain an ounce.

288
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,676
Now, I have a chocolate shake,
my ass jiggles for a week.

289
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,629
- Enjoy the metabolism while you got it.
- Metalobism?

290
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,396
Good God, it's 2:30 in the morning.
You must be wrecked.

291
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,236
Anyways, I had fun today.
Did you have fun?

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,877
Yeah, you're all right.

293
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,954
Have a good one.

294
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,557
Could I have a night-light?

295
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,792
Night-light? I think I can
help you out. Hang on.

296
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,710
Let's see here.

297
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,352
There you go, all right?

298
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,873
Are you my dad?

299
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,352
No, I'm not, but...

300
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,592
...that Dad and Mom thing
we'll figure out in the morning.

301
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,358
You just go to sleep.

302
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,235
- Good night.
- Good night.

303
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,438
Go get the can, okay?

304
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,636
Go! Go! Go!

305
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,750
I'm thinking about keeping the kid.

306
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,796
Remember when we went to
the pet store...

307
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,828
...and you wanted that puppy,
but I reminded you about feeding it...

308
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,957
...cleaning it
and toilet training it?

309
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,953
This is kind of like that,
except with a human.

310
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,476
I mean, I'm glad you had fun and all,
but this is big.

311
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,871
I gotta do something big.
I think Vanessa will respect that.

312
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,318
You think that since women get pregnant
to fix a troubled relationship...

313
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,994
...why can't a guy adopt a kid
to do the same?

314
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,710
I didn't think of it like that.
But yes, that's what I'm thinking.

315
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,191
Sounds nuts to me, pal.
Do yourself a favor. Sleep on it.

316
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,192
You're right.
Can I use your phone?

317
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,839
Arthur Brooks speaking.

318
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,718
How you doing?
Kevin Gerrity.

319
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,313
<i>Right on, Mr. Gerrity.</i>

320
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,754
We were expecting you.

321
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,117
Do you still got a foster family
lined up for Julian?

322
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,156
Yes, we do.

323
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,153
I've decided to
take care of the little guy.

324
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,038
Way to sleep on it, pal.

325
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,919
You two want to get married,
I support that.

326
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,073
When parents take the responsibility,
there's no bigger high for us.

327
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,673
<i>I'm psyched about it too.</i>

328
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,875
So that's it.

329
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,997
Yep. Good luck
to you and your son.

330
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,354
My son.

331
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,749
Goddamn stick!

332
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,399
That's my boy.

333
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,314
Go back to sleep.

334
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,910
Well, I'm going back to sleep.
Nighty-night.

335
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,953
I wet my bed.

336
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,997
Oh, God.

337
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,669
That's a shitload of piss.

338
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,398
There you go, all right?

339
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,437
No more wetness.

340
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,675
Sleep, all right? Just try to sleep.
Stay asleep.

341
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,032
Sit still!

342
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,476
Lay!

343
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,473
All right! I'm up!

344
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,076
It smells like urine in this joint.
Good job.

345
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,632
What're you doing there, boy?

346
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,074
Making cereal.

347
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,073
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
pour me a bowl?

348
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,757
Or don't pour me a bowl. Either way.

349
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,719
I got it. I got it.

350
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,599
We can fix this.

351
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,151
It's not a big deal.

352
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,913
Look. See?

353
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,230
See how quick it goes away?

354
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,434
Crybaby, come on.

355
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,353
Don't worry about it, boy.

356
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,870
Scuba Steve, damn you!

357
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,389
You think that's funny,
me getting hurt?

358
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,435
There's a bright side to being up
before 11: McDonald's breakfast.

359
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,399
I haven't been up for that
in 10 years. You wanna go?

360
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,517
Tie your shoes, we'll go. Hurry.

361
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,353
It's like 12 blocks from here,
so tie quickly.

362
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,152
Do you need help with that?

363
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,958
I can do it.

364
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,999
Let me do it.

365
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,192
You loop it, you swoop it and you pull.

366
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,398
You loop it, you swoop it, you pull.

367
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,471
Good. Let's go. We're in a hurry.

368
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,758
It's different for your generation.

369
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,560
You've always had
McDonald's breakfast available.

370
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,789
I have?

371
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,952
When I was born, all we had were
the burgers and fries.

372
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,476
Maybe the fish sandwich. I'm not sure.
I'll get back to you.

373
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,914
What are you doing?

374
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,317
Oh, yeah, the hand-holding thing.

375
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,069
My dad took us to McDonald's
the first morning they had breakfast.

376
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,676
Everybody was baffled.
"Are these sausages or hamburgers?"

377
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,558
I have to go to the bathroom.

378
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,791
We're gonna be there
in a minute.

379
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,439
I gotta go now.

380
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,193
Didn't you pee enough in bed?

381
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,033
We only got nine minutes
to get there.

382
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,158
But I gotta go to the bathroom.

383
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,833
All right, let's go.

384
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,796
Can my kid use the bathroom
for a minute?

385
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,916
Customers only.

386
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,151
He's just a kid.
We'll be in and out.

387
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,674
That's not my problem.

388
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,354
It's not your problem? All right.

389
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,669
Come on.

390
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,112
Here you are.
Your waiter will be right with you.

391
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,919
I can't do it.

392
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,435
What do you mean,
you can't do it? Just go.

393
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,717
I'm scared. Could you do it too?

394
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,709
All right.

395
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,748
Here we go.

396
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,873
And we're off.

397
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,314
That's not too difficult, right?

398
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,994
And we're both losing weight.

399
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,432
Good job. We're gonna miss
breakfast. Let's go.

400
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,153
Put it away.

401
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,477
- Thanks, anyways.
- Sure thing. Anytime.

402
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,278
Move your ass there, pee-boy.

403
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,671
We only got five minutes,
five minutes. Now four.

404
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,036
Come on. We're almost there.

405
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,119
Hey, mister. Why are you
sitting on the ground?

406
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,635
This is where I live.

407
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,835
We gotta get going.

408
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,876
Why?

409
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,471
In retrospect, I made some
bad choices after high school.

410
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,392
- We gotta get going.
- Why?

411
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,995
This was during the
so-called Disco Era...

412
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,676
...but for me, it was more
the Doing Mushrooms Era.

413
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,150
- We're gonna miss breakfast.
- Why?

414
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,628
I never thought about that.

415
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,269
I was never Mr. Popularity
in high school...

416
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,909
...and I watched <i>Fantasia</i> a lot.

417
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,673
- One day it clicked.
- Hey, yappy.

418
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,036
If you end it,
you get an Egg McMuffin.

419
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,271
How about a Sausage McMuffin
with hash browns?

420
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,748
You got a deal.

421
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,794
Look, look. He fell asleep.
Let's go.

422
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,470
Let's go.

423
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,754
Sausage McMuffin.

424
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,194
Pardon me, sir.

425
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,634
How you doing?

426
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,279
What can I get for you?

427
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,272
- What do you want?
- Cheerios.

428
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,078
They don't got Cheerios.

429
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,876
Lasagna.

430
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,918
What's the matter?
We'll take hot cakes and sausage.

431
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,071
Sorry. We stopped serving breakfast.

432
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,151
We're four seconds late.

433
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,676
You're 30 minutes and four seconds late.
Breakfast stops at 10:30.

434
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,915
Horseshit!

435
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,395
Don't cry. Sorry.

436
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,392
I was cursing at the lady, not you.

437
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,629
Nice parenting.

438
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,189
Thanks. Are you my therapist?
Take a walk.

439
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,919
Do you want a Happy Meal?

440
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,639
You got a Happy Meal?

441
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,757
Will somebody
get the kid a Happy Meal?!

442
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,275
Relax.

443
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,799
Where's my Egg McMuffin?

444
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,797
Breakfast is over at 10:30.

445
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,918
- Really? I thought it was 11.
- I thought that too.

446
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,078
Total mind blower.

447
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,436
Will you just relax? Here.

448
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,272
What do you want me to do?

449
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,518
You're gonna meet Vanessa tonight.
You'll like her.

450
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,348
You wanna see me get hurt?
That'll cheer you up?

451
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,195
All right.

452
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,397
You think that's funny?

453
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,954
Good. No more crying.

454
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,155
Are you okay?

455
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,311
Next time, kill me.

456
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,755
Let's do it, Rangers.

457
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,389
<i>- Rangers against</i>
<i>the Tampa Bay Lightning.</i>

458
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,834
<i>And at this stage...</i>

459
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,755
<i>... it's as close as you can get</i>
<i>to a must-win game for the Rangers.</i>

460
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,479
<i>Or they'll fall behind...</i>

461
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,476
How you doing?

462
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,596
How you doing?

463
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,116
You like hockey?

464
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,355
You like hockey?

465
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,438
This is a big, important game.

466
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,159
This is a big, important game.

467
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,470
Cut the crap.

468
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,915
Cut the crap.

469
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,799
I'm serious. Don't do that.

470
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,632
I'm serious. Don't do that.

471
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,236
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck,
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

472
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,879
That's what I thought. Shut up.

473
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,955
Don't you take naps?

474
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,235
Sometimes.

475
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,629
Go take a nap.

476
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,757
I'm too hungry to sleep.

477
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,198
You want some food?

478
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,751
Having a kid is great...

479
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,153
...as long as his eyes are closed
and he's not moving or speaking.

480
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,637
<i>He's taken down! Penalty shot!</i>

481
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,792
How you doing? You sleepwalking?

482
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,511
Why don't you go back sleepy?
Sleepy.

483
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,239
Keep napping. What's this?

484
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,436
Kangaroo song.

485
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,116
That's terrific. And we'll watch this
after the game, okay?

486
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,591
But after my nap,
I always watch the kangaroo song.

487
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,549
It's overtime, and there's
a penalty shot about to take place.

488
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,835
It happens every 10 years...

489
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,037
Kangaroo song. Kangaroo song!

490
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,429
All right!

491
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,357
God! You were normal yesterday.

492
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,672
I can't take this.
Are you serious?

493
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,319
<i>Come and play</i>

494
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,312
<i>What do you say?</i>

495
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,834
Douche-bag kangaroo.

496
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,873
Are you all hopped out?

497
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,869
I don't know what to do.
Hopefully Vanessa will.

498
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,396
I think she's back.
If she's not back, we'll wait for her.

499
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,039
Get your coat. Clean up.

500
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,552
Oh, God. You don't
have to pee, do you?

501
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,111
- Do you swear?
- I swear.

502
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,194
How come you're not going?

503
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,989
I don't have to go. Only you and
my grandfather go every 30 seconds.

504
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,033
Let's hurry it up, all right?
I'm keeping you company.

505
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,718
He'll write your name on the wall.
Mind your business.

506
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,276
Let's go. Let's go.

507
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,232
Why do I need to meet this lady?

508
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,550
- Now it is your problem.
- Thank you.

509
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,631
She's that lady I was
telling you about.

510
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,348
She's gonna be a big part
of your life.

511
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,433
I'm scared. What if she's not nice?

512
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,829
Look.

513
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,716
See these right here?
These are magic sunglasses, okay?

514
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,116
If you're afraid, put them on
to become invisible.

515
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,112
Really? Nobody can see me?

516
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,509
Put them on.

517
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,708
Sonny, I'm right here.

518
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,916
Oh, the glasses. I couldn't see you.

519
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,709
Keep those on. No one can notice you
until you decide they can.

520
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,790
- Okay.
- Let's go.

521
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,914
I'm still right here.

522
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,230
Okay, all right, the glasses.

523
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,030
Welcome back.

524
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,150
Who's that?

525
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,595
Who's who? He's invisible.

526
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,150
Can I come in?

527
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,636
Sure.

528
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,191
Any invisible people out here...

529
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,351
...feel free to come in, okay?

530
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,638
Sonny, I don't really know
what's going on right now.

531
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,633
- We should talk...
- You said I got some thinking to do?

532
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,108
So I did it.

533
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,955
Just because I don't have a job
doesn't mean I don't wanna move on.

534
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,435
Instead of saying that,
I figured I'd show you.

535
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,875
- Before you say anything...
- Look at that.

536
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,553
He took his sunglasses off.

537
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,756
He wants you to see him.
He likes you.

538
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,349
Julian, come here.

539
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,999
Come here, pal.

540
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,554
Vanessa...

541
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,598
...I want you to meet Julian, my son.

542
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,119
Our son. I adopted him.

543
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,238
I don't know what to say.

544
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,799
Don't say anything.

545
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,593
Is someone in the bathroom?

546
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,790
Why is the door shut?

547
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,836
I don't know.

548
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,229
You don't?

549
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,359
I don't know.

550
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,994
I can't believe this.

551
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,756
Open up.

552
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,872
Open the door!

553
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,917
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, my God.

554
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,271
I'm sorry. I was freaking out there.

555
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,033
- I'm Sonny.
- Sid.

556
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,034
I had an attack of paranoia. I thought
you were sleeping with my girl.

557
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,679
I am.

558
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,796
What's that?

559
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,189
I am.

560
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,716
That's what I was trying to tell you
before. I found someone.

561
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,757
- This old guy?
- Sid.

562
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,718
He's already achieved so much...

563
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,713
...and yet he's still goal-oriented
and still focused.

564
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,393
And he has a five-year plan.

565
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,073
What is it? "Don't die"?

566
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,959
I can't believe this. We got
a family now. This is what you wanted.

567
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,794
You surprising me with a kid
that you adopted...

568
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,270
...wasn't what I wanted.
- I did this for you.

569
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,195
You wanted me to be more responsible.
I can't raise this kid alone.

570
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,591
You remind me of my grandson.
You don't think things through.

571
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,593
Hey, Old Man River, zip it
or I'll break your hip.

572
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,797
- I'd like to see you try it.
- Shut up.

573
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,474
How'd you misconstrue
the situation so badly?

574
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,278
I don't know.

575
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,955
Deep down you must've known
this day was coming.

576
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,550
You made the biggest mistake
of your life.

577
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,836
I know you'll be missing me
when you got...

578
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,275
...that big, white, wrinkly...

579
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,919
...body on top of you...

580
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,878
...with his loose skin...

581
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,838
...and old balls.

582
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,638
Gross.

583
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,037
Excuse me. How you doing?
I'm Kevin Gerrity.

584
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,999
I got an emergency problem.
Is Arthur Brooks around?

585
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,639
I'll go get him for you.

586
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,872
Stay where I can see you.
I gotta talk to this guy.

587
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,553
Mr. Gerrity?

588
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,957
- Arthur Brooks.
- How are you? I need to speak with you.

589
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,111
I didn't tell you to come here, did I?

590
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,316
I was gonna mail you
the paperwork.

591
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,357
It's like the opposite of that.

592
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,677
Look, I can't manage this kid.

593
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,673
I ain't a good father.
I made a big mistake.

594
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,670
Mistake?

595
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,150
I had a mother lined up for him...

596
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,914
...but she's banging
the Pepperidge Farm guy.

597
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,276
The kid won't stop
peeing and throwing up.

598
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,034
He's like a cocker spaniel.
I just...

599
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,510
He'd be better off
with his natural mother.

600
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,919
Well, she passed away last night,
Mr. Gerrity.

601
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,312
She had cancer. She must have sensed
that her time was running short.

602
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,120
She wanted her son to be with
the natural father.

603
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,188
Loop.

604
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,830
Pull.

605
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,398
If you don't wanna take care
of him...

606
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,030
...we'll take him. But he'll have to
chill in a group home.

607
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,918
Group home? Like an orphanage?

608
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,559
We don't call them that.

609
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,113
Look, I did it.
Loop, swoop and pull.

610
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,270
You did do it.

611
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,839
Congratulations, kid.

612
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,593
I showed him that.

613
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,149
Why don't you go back over there, okay?

614
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,514
- I'll call the Heatherton Home...
- Let's do this.

615
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,991
I'll hang onto the kid
until you find him a new family.

616
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,437
I don't know. I gotta watch out
for the kid's best interest.

617
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,830
You said yourself you were a bogus dad.

618
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,071
He's better off with me
than in an orphanage.

619
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,960
I don't wanna put him in a home
any more than you do.

620
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,873
Why don't we pretend you
didn't even come in here?

621
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,918
I'll give you a shout
when I line up a family.

622
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,309
- That's good.
- Later.

623
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,318
Just don't make me regret this.

624
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,433
Where are we going now?

625
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,639
I gotta make a phone call.
Just stay right here, all right?

626
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,394
<i>- This is a collect call from:</i>
<i>- Your baby boy.</i>

627
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,279
<i>- To accept charges, say, "Yes."</i>
- Yeah, I'll accept.

628
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,471
Dad, how's it going?
How's Florida?

629
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,951
Not too bad. Your mother got
a sunburn playing tennis.

630
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,998
- I got some interesting news.
<i>- Oh, yeah? What?</i>

631
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,878
Kind of adopted a kid.

632
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,155
What do you mean?

633
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,198
I'm talking about
you being a grandfather.

634
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,112
Who the hell would give you a kid?

635
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,759
Social Services.

636
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,150
You idiot. You better give
that kid back.

637
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,958
His mother's...

638
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,355
Hang on.

639
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,511
Go play with them pigeons, buddy.

640
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,792
I tried to give him back.
I just can't. All right?

641
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,393
I need your help.

642
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,076
<i>I'm in a bad way. Vanessa dumped me.</i>
<i>I don't know what I'm doing.</i>

643
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,992
You're damn right.

644
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,912
The kid is always around.

645
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,230
He never leaves me alone.

646
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,552
You'd think he'd want some privacy.
I'm in deep shit.

647
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,473
Give that kid back before
you ruin both your lives.

648
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,835
I appreciate that.

649
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,036
He's better off living in a dumpster.

650
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,872
I'll be a better father than you!

651
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,350
Impossible!
All you care about is yourself!

652
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,876
Yeah? No, I care about you
saving money on this call!

653
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,314
Let's eat.

654
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,796
The Vanessa thing did not work out.

655
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,350
She lost her damn mind.
That wasn't your fault, though, okay?

656
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,954
I know when you first got here, you
thought you were gonna meet your dad.

657
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,430
But I don't think
that's gonna happen.

658
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,516
Why?

659
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,989
I don't know.

660
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,994
But, buddy, real dads
aren't always that great.

661
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,037
I got one and he's
out of his mind.

662
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,955
He tells me what to do. He never lets
me figure stuff out on my own.

663
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,272
A lot of dads are like that.
That's why people grow up nuts.

664
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,433
Look at this guy.

665
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,309
He was probably a nice boy like you.
Then his dad messed his mind up.

666
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,913
Who won the Jets game?

667
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,070
Who cares?

668
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,470
Let it go.
He can't control you anymore.

669
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,709
What do you mean?

670
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,949
You know.

671
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,076
You're a loser.

672
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,914
You're mad at your dad, not at me!
I forgive you!

673
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,880
I am. I am. I hate my father.

674
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,510
I don't want it to be like that.
I don't wanna control you.

675
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,279
You even like your name?

676
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,716
I guess.

677
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,996
You guess? Shouldn't you like
your name?

678
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,470
It'll be your name
the rest of your life.

679
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,109
What do you want?

680
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,599
Frankenstein.

681
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,877
I can deal with that.
I'll call you Frankenstein.

682
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,031
Frankenstein, you gonna play
in the puddle?

683
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,397
Go ahead. From now on, you do
whatever you wanna do.

684
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,790
I'll show you some cool shit
along the way.

685
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,598
That's what it's all about.

686
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,391
Stay in front of it.
Don't be scared.

687
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,437
It's coming right at you.

688
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,875
Okay. All right.

689
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,429
You're picking your head up.
Don't do that.

690
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,438
Is this okay?

691
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,398
That's what you wanna wear?

692
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,639
That's okay with me then.

693
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,235
Good luck walking down the street.

694
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,558
Way to block it. Stay with it.

695
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,836
You're the next Willie Randolph.

696
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,193
Chief Jay Strongbow
used to do a sleeper hold.

697
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,589
Put your arm under here.

698
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,992
Lift this arm, okay? Slide under
and try to lock wrists.

699
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,673
Let me show you. Watch.

700
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,354
Throw him into the ropes
and he comes back...

701
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,390
Get him. Get him. Lock him up.

702
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,959
Lock wrists.

703
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,799
You bring him down slow.

704
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,594
Apply pressure.

705
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,433
He's going to sleep now.

706
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,036
See, he's out.

707
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,029
Wake up.

708
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,673
You'll be the only kid your age
with a slingshot.

709
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,311
Go have some fun. Shoot a few
beer cans or something.

710
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,148
You like that?

711
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,273
Sonny, Sonny, come here!

712
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,397
What is it? What's the matter?

713
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,638
Let me have that.

714
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,438
Go to your room. I think.
Or do whatever you want.

715
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,470
It's gonna be fun. You nervous?

716
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,836
No? You're excited, aren't you?

717
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,435
Let's go. Up, up, up.

718
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,791
Here comes some candy.

719
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,316
How you doing?

720
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,029
Happy Halloween!
We got a first-timer.

721
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,714
Do the right thing, buddy.

722
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,076
We want some candy!

723
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,794
Hang on right here for a second.
Don't move.

724
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,359
Yeah, that's it.

725
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,551
Yeah, CDs. You like that?

726
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,275
He's not happy. What else you got?

727
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,271
Okay, that's good. Trick-or-treat.

728
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,437
Say, "Happy Halloween."

729
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,591
Thank you.

730
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,229
Next year, be prepared, moron.

731
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,953
What's with the cummerbund?

732
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,872
I let him wear whatever he wants.

733
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,519
Those boots are the best.

734
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,512
I think they're Kevin's.

735
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,872
I'll have a hot dog with
the mustard and a knish.

736
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,473
Frankenstein, what do you want?

737
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,153
Thirty packets of ketchup.

738
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,755
All right. Thirty packets of ketchup.

739
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,594
Nice cut, pal.

740
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,550
Frankenstein.

741
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,195
Do that thing I taught you
the other day.

742
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,711
It took him 20 minutes to learn that.
He's quick. He's smart.

743
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,871
- And he loves ketchup.
- He does.

744
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,350
This is a whole new school
of child-raising.

745
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,797
You give him options, not orders.
Let him make the decision.

746
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,109
You're a pioneer.

747
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,193
- So you two just chill out all day?
- Basically.

748
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,716
Hung out on the monkey bars.
The kid did eight chin-ups.

749
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,315
I can't even do one
with these scrawny arms.

750
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,551
They're not scrawny. They're nice.

751
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,510
What do you wanna do tomorrow?

752
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,352
I wanna go to school.

753
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,831
I don't force him, he makes
the right decision. Way to go.

754
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,719
We'll enroll you on Monday.
Enjoy the weekend.

755
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,109
Do the thing again.

756
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,159
That one touched the ground.

757
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,469
That was awesome!

758
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,914
Good job.

759
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,512
Help me! Help me!

760
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,509
Please help me.
I don't know where I live.

761
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,830
This isn't a big problem.

762
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,150
We'll find your parents.

763
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,590
- What's your name?
- Frankenstein.

764
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,675
There you are.

765
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,956
There you are. Are you okay, buddy?

766
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,637
I turn my head and he disappeared.

767
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,553
Don't you ever do that to me again.
Don't do that.

768
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,560
Thank you for being sweet
to my little boy.

769
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,438
You're welcome, Sonny.

770
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,632
I think my sister, Corinne,
is engaged to your roommate.

771
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,519
Your sister's Corinne? That sucks.

772
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,433
Yeah, I'm up from D.C.
I was at that party...

773
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,069
...where we wasted
the good surprise on you.

774
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,355
Sorry about that.

775
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,552
So, what, you have a son now?

776
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,598
I'm not his dad.
I'm more of a father-figure type...

777
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,513
...until Social Services
can get another family.

778
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,716
At which point,
you'll find a new way...

779
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,679
...to initiate conversations
with girls in the park.

780
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,558
Yeah, that's correct.

781
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,875
Good job, buddy!

782
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,559
He's peeing on his own.

783
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,313
Keep it flowing! That's it!

784
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,516
Go! Go!

785
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,388
So does Corinne's sister have a name?

786
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,795
It's Layla.

787
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,395
Layla? I like your song.

788
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,474
Could you do me a favor?

789
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,073
Could you hang out with me?

790
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,880
He'll think he's a failure
if he couldn't get me a date.

791
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,235
I really can't.

792
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,032
I have a ton of work to do.

793
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,316
I see. Hang on a second.

794
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,675
Come here.

795
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,519
Layla, if you don't come over
to Sonny's apartment tonight...

796
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,399
...there's a good chance
I'll develop a stutter.

797
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,912
P-P-P-Please don't do this to me.

798
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,749
- That is so cheap.
- What?

799
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,756
So I'm working in a tollbooth now.

800
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,309
I originally wanted to be
a male model...

801
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,552
...but I'm not very good-looking,
so that didn't work out.

802
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,153
I'm sorry to hear that.

803
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,038
I'm all right. I'm recovering.

804
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,840
This is my favorite part
of the song right here.

805
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,036
<i>If I can't have you</i>

806
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,072
Better keep it down low.
The kid's gonna wake up.

807
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,793
Too late.

808
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,951
Okay. Just hang out a little bit.

809
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,873
I'll be right back.
Don't go sneaking out.

810
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,677
- What are you doing?
- You forgot to say good night.

811
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,955
What do you mean?

812
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,714
I can't go to sleep
until you say good night.

813
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,428
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry. Good night.

814
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,473
Go to sleep now, all right?

815
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,039
What'd we learn about girls?

816
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,670
Initiating the conversation
is half the battle.

817
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,070
Bingo. Now sleep, okay?

818
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,237
I gave him Nyquil.
He should be out for the night.

819
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,759
This is Styx. They've been
my favorite band since I was 12.

820
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,035
You're kidding me.

821
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,874
No, I can't help it.
I just love them.

822
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,792
My friends make fun of me.

823
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,191
My friends make fun of me too.
I've seen them 25 times.

824
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,034
Tommy Shaw, when I was 16,
I was at the concert...

825
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,430
...and he reached down,
pulled me on stage.

826
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,870
I did the robot voice for "Mr. Roboto."

827
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,836
Really?

828
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,718
No, I made that up. I'm sorry.

829
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,712
That would've been cool, right?

830
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,712
My cousin's friends
with their drummer...

831
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,269
...so when they come to town,
we go to dinner...

832
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,590
...and they tell us stories
from the road.

833
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,556
Really?

834
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,951
No, I made that up again too.
I'm sorry.

835
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,750
You're not attracted to, like,
60-year-old guys, are you?

836
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,348
Yeah, I don't like them either.

837
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,631
I can't sleep.

838
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,994
He can't sleep.

839
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,119
So the rabbit ran across the street...

840
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,318
...because he thought
he saw some carrots.

841
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,676
But when he got across the street...

842
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,718
...it turned out they weren't carrots,
they were peanuts.

843
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,678
Peanuts?

844
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,559
The peanuts belonged to a squirrel...

845
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,872
...who had taken them home
from a baseball game.

846
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,839
And then the rabbit
thought to himself...

847
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,196
..."Carrots, peanuts,
what's the difference?"

848
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,593
So he asked the squirrel
if he could have some.

849
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,717
And the squirrel said, "Of course."

850
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,839
And the rabbit was very happy
to make such a nice new friend.

851
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,711
And so was the squirrel.

852
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,554
And the rabbit thought the squirrel
had pretty hair.

853
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,589
And nice eyes also.

854
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,557
And the squirrel thought the rabbit
was really nice too.

855
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,156
And then, the rabbit
worked up his courage...

856
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,550
...and asked the squirrel
if he could have...

857
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,360
...just the littlest squirrel kiss.

858
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,829
And the squirrel thought
it just wasn't the right time...

859
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,038
...in her busy squirrel life
to be kissing any rabbits...

860
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,590
...even though this particular rabbit
was very sweet.

861
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,275
And the rabbit got shut down, did he?

862
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,513
That's all right.
But he was still thinking maybe...

863
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,479
...Scuba Steve could get
a squirrel kiss...

864
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,711
...so somebody's getting some action.

865
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,271
Good night, Scuba Steve.

866
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,593
Good night, Frankenstein.

867
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,628
Good night, Sonny.

868
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,438
Good night, Layla.

869
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,278
Don't get caught with any girls.

870
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,556
It's your first day. Take it slow.

871
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,638
I'll meet you after school
at 2:30, right out front.

872
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,275
You're not staying?

873
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,909
No, I gotta go get you
some more ketchup.

874
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,673
I don't like these kids.

875
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,753
I don't either,
but shouldn't we give them a chance?

876
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,554
How's this?

877
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,990
Here are the magic sunglasses.

878
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,038
You put them on
if you feel scared, okay?

879
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,955
I lost you.

880
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,395
I don't know where you are.
I'm sorry.

881
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,868
Oh, there you go.

882
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,550
You go inside and make some friends.

883
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,158
Oh, yeah, that's a good hug.

884
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,073
All right. Go inside.
I'm gonna miss you.

885
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,357
Hi, I like your hat.

886
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,079
What's your name?

887
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,955
<i>- Might as well...</i>
<i>- Leave a message!</i>

888
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,351
<i>- Might as well...</i>
<i>- Leave a message!</i>

889
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,872
<i>Mr. Gerrity, this is Arthur Brooks</i>
<i>from Social Services. I got good news.</i>

890
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,190
<i>We may have found</i>
<i>a family for Julian.</i>

891
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,715
<i>Give me a call back</i>
<i>as soon as possible...</i>

892
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,349
<i>... so we can set up a meeting. Bye.</i>

893
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,313
Sierra Club Legal Department.

894
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,993
Can I speak to Layla Maloney?

895
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,556
Layla, line four.

896
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,554
You're a lawyer?

897
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,193
What are you doing?

898
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,637
Waiting for Julian so I can have
somebody to play with.

899
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,872
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- I'm swamped.

900
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,111
I gotta do my laundry
on my lunch hour.

901
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,238
I was gonna do my laundry today too.
Where are you going?

902
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,119
There's a place nearby,
Suds, on Bleecker.

903
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,079
I know that place.
Maybe I'll see you there then.

904
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,550
Maybe. I gotta go.

905
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,033
<i>I bought tickets,</i>
<i>and the show was the night before.</i>

906
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,156
<i>Maybe it was a mistake.</i>

907
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,109
That's nice, but you don't know
what's going down on the streets.

908
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,152
It's hard to know what's going down...

909
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,756
...when you're in an office
seven days a week, Mr. Tollbooth.

910
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,116
You're not gonna tell me
to get a real job.

911
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,351
No. You're a big boy.

912
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,556
It's cool you only work
one day a week.

913
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,108
These are the cutest things
I've ever seen.

914
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,110
I know.

915
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,920
I have them in yellow.
I wear them when I work out.

916
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,272
It's great what you're doing
with Julian while you got him.

917
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,675
Yeah, well, I got him.

918
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,512
I read an article that said...

919
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,877
...the most important influences
in a kid's life are his friends.

920
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,269
They said that?

921
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,559
Just hope he's not hanging out with
drug dealers and delinquents in school.

922
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,035
I'm kidding.

923
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,509
I know. I know.

924
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,998
Man, this Yoo-hoo is good.
You know what else is good?

925
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,753
Smoking dope.

926
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,599
I ain't going to rat you out.

927
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,989
Puffing the cheeba.

928
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,869
Go by the seesaw, smoke a J.
You know what I'm talking about?

929
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,839
I have a bellybutton.

930
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,588
You have a bellybutton?
We all have bellybuttons.

931
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,752
And we all love Yoo-hoo.
Especially with a little rum.

932
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,790
What's rum?

933
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,109
You don't know?

934
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,395
Rumpelstiltskin?

935
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,954
Rumpelstiltskin's a good man.
So are you guys.

936
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,030
Stay clean. Stay focused.

937
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,874
Frankenstein,
have fun with your friends.

938
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,192
Why are you scratching so much?

939
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,351
I have ecza...

940
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,953
Eczema? Gross.

941
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,758
How do I make it stop itching?

942
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,309
I don't know. You scratch it.

943
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,630
SpaghettiO's. Do you like
SpaghettiO's?

944
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,999
Dented cans are half price.

945
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,550
Microsoft went down three points.
We gotta save some money.

946
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,073
Here, give it a shot.

947
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,913
That's it, boy.

948
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,673
Put it in there. Feels good.

949
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,388
Hi, Sonny.
Hi, Sonny's friend.

950
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,789
His name's Frankenstein.

951
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,792
Hi, Frankenstein. Remember me?

952
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,600
Help me. I'm lost.
I don't know where I am.

953
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,159
You don't gotta do that.

954
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,358
You guys wear the same size
T-shirt. That's cool.

955
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,670
I heard you did laundry
with my sister.

956
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,148
She said we did laundry?

957
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,119
Where I'm from, it's called
doing the hibbity-dibbity.

958
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,068
I got eczema.

959
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,635
Well, then you shouldn't scratch it.

960
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,440
Don't tell him what to do.
He can scratch.

961
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,318
- Scratch.
- Is that better?

962
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,278
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

963
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,354
You know about kids?
I thought you were a foot doctor.

964
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,559
It's not doctor stuff. It's common
sense. Scratching spreads rashes.

965
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,950
This is something
you learned at Hooters.

966
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,788
- What the hell is he doing?
- He's shopping.

967
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,395
Microsoft went down three points.

968
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,275
That's good.
See you later, Frankenstein.

969
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,910
Stay away from the frozen-food section.
Your boobs'll harden.

970
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,551
Isn't Little Italy the greatest?

971
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,759
I like it. Everyone always tells me
to hang out in the Village and SoHo.

972
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,876
That's all right.

973
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,113
But you gotta respect a place where
the fatter you are, the cooler you are.

974
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,756
Last time, he was with
a different girl. I guess he ate her.

975
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,998
I went to Coney Island today
with the little boy.

976
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,310
You gotta take a look at this.

977
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,437
We had a blast together.

978
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,514
He's so happy.

979
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,079
He is such a good boy.

980
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,676
If I have a kid of my own,
I hope he's half as cool as that kid.

981
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,594
Is he picking your nose?

982
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,036
Yeah, he was picking his own all day...

983
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,555
...so I figured he could borrow mine.
- Sweet.

984
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,155
He must be miserable
without you right now.

985
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,799
No, he's in good hands.

986
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,273
Look at Brad's body.
Not an ounce of fat on it.

987
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,199
- What?
- Don't worry. I like yours better.

988
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,396
I got two queens, two jacks
and an ace.

989
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,153
- I win.
- Why do you win?

990
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,154
I got a two, a four, a ten,
an eight and a six.

991
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,072
I don't understand.
Why do you win?

992
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,515
- Because I win.
- What's the name of that game?

993
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,510
I win.

994
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,988
I'll get it!

995
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,350
- What's up?
- I'm looking for Kevin Gerrity.

996
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,192
He's in China. Who are you?

997
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,830
Arthur Brooks, New York City
Social Services. I'm confused.

998
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,594
Chinatown. He loves those egg rolls.

999
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,674
I've tried contacting him several times
and he hasn't responded.

1000
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,114
I'm concerned.

1001
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,078
Ixnay on the ketchupnay.

1002
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,151
- Have him call me.
- All right.

1003
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,351
My body's definitely better than his.

1004
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,352
Without question.

1005
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,955
It took you a long time to pencil me in.
You work all the time.

1006
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,349
I know. I'm excited.

1007
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,034
You're excited.
How long you been this crazy?

1008
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,160
I guess ever since
I was a little girl.

1009
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,118
See, my mom got married really young
and pretty much just raised us kids.

1010
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,112
So when my dad took off...

1011
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,715
...she wasn't left
with a lot of options.

1012
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,838
And I think that's when I decided...

1013
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,548
...that I never wanted to end up
in that situation.

1014
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,634
That's actually a good reason
to be working.

1015
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,509
I guess I feel like I gotta kick ass
while there's ass to be kicked.

1016
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,753
You kick that ass during the day,
but at night you have fun with Sonny.

1017
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,838
<i>The Best of Times</i>

1018
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,119
<i>Are when I'm alone with you</i>

1019
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,315
<i>Some rain, some shine</i>

1020
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,351
Two guys you were best friends with in
law school fell in love with each other?

1021
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,874
Is that strange for you?

1022
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,951
No. Nothing changed, really.

1023
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,351
They watch a different kind
of porno now. But that's it.

1024
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,797
My God! This is Corinne's place?

1025
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,508
If the girls at Hooters
could see her now.

1026
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,719
- Do you want your ass kicked?
- I'm just kidding around, Layla.

1027
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,276
You're afraid to get involved
and you got a lot of work, but...

1028
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,753
...when I'm not with you, I'm thinking
of you. Do you have that going on?

1029
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,035
Maybe.

1030
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,669
Maybe we should try a kiss out.

1031
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,072
We owe it to ourselves to see
if we should move to the next level.

1032
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,359
I'm not sure.

1033
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,478
Me either. It's just that
you kissed Scuba Steve.

1034
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,188
Ever since then,
he's strutted around bragging...

1035
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,513
..."I got a kiss the first night.
After three times, you got nothing."

1036
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,909
- He said that?
- Come on.

1037
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,357
Let's just give it a shot
just so I can have some dignity.

1038
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,874
All right?

1039
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,591
Oh, my God!

1040
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,114
Gross!

1041
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,759
Did I witness the first kiss?

1042
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,434
Yeah, you did.
Thanks a lot for showing up.

1043
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,958
Layla, you didn't actually
enjoy that, did you?

1044
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,634
I don't know. I'm going upstairs.

1045
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,916
Wash your mouth out. He's dirty.

1046
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,673
And he's poor.

1047
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,754
What do you got in the bag, Corinne?
Some chicken wings? Booby tassels?

1048
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:38,956
Shut up.

1049
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,599
You have a good sleep.

1050
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,353
Pleasant Hooters.

1051
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,558
Come on, come on!

1052
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,672
This is where we hang our jackets.

1053
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,989
This is my hook.

1054
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,514
That's a capertillar.

1055
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,829
A caterpillar.

1056
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,311
- That's right, a capertillar.
- Capertillar, all right.

1057
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,073
- Staying clean, pal?
- Yes.

1058
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,153
You drink the booze, you lose.
Remember that, punk.

1059
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,711
I'm Julian's teacher, Ms. Foote.

1060
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,951
- You his father?
- I'm Kevin Gerrity.

1061
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,795
Do you have some time to go over some
things that have been bothering me?

1062
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,150
Sure.

1063
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,118
Go take a walk, pal.

1064
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,273
Julian has been displaying
some odd behavior.

1065
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,637
He spilled glue on the floor
and didn't tell anyone.

1066
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,438
He covered it with newspaper.

1067
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,398
And then one of our students wore
Rollerblades for show-and-tell.

1068
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,074
And Julian tripped him with a stick.

1069
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,355
I've never...

1070
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,672
Julian found it hilarious.

1071
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,150
I like him to express himself freely.

1072
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,278
I've really never seen
any problems with that.

1073
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,157
Your boy's making the least progress
of any of the children.

1074
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,269
Frankly, his personal hygiene
is becoming a cause for concern.

1075
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,996
He's the smelly kid in class?
I let him become the smelly kid?

1076
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,355
What's wrong with me?

1077
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,431
I've had some smelly ones before.

1078
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,955
But your son is by far the smelliest.

1079
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,873
All right, I got you.
What do you think I should do?

1080
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,680
Start by paying more attention
to his schoolwork.

1081
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,556
The class is giving a presentation
of the Founding Fathers.

1082
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,713
Julian has drawn the part of Benjamin
Franklin, a very important role.

1083
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,109
Do what you can to help.

1084
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,954
I will turn this all around.
That's a promise.

1085
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,519
Thank you very much.

1086
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,069
Stinky, let's go.
You got us in trouble.

1087
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,548
Did he call him "Stinky"?

1088
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,400
Wow, I didn't know this
about George Washington.

1089
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,915
Yes, his teeth were made of wool.

1090
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,673
Wood.

1091
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,232
I sorry. I mix up "D" and "L."

1092
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,629
Well, get it right.

1093
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,918
Turn that game off, pal.

1094
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,388
I got four guys left.

1095
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,073
Let's study a little bit.

1096
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,435
I don't wanna study.

1097
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,590
Give me that.

1098
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,438
- You just killed me.
- So what? You'll play later.

1099
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,193
You can't tell me what to do.

1100
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,194
Really? Let's take a vote.
Who thinks the kid should study?

1101
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,512
Who doesn't?
Well, you just lost, two to one.

1102
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,877
It's a tie. That guy doesn't count.
He can't even read.

1103
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,156
I know. He was just joking around.

1104
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,276
Can you hang out here a little bit?
I gotta go do something.

1105
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,635
No problem.

1106
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,279
<i>Would you like</i>

1107
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,998
<i>We'll hop, hop, hop, hop</i>

1108
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,878
<i>What do you say</i>

1109
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,873
Get the door.

1110
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,998
Hi, Julian. How you doing?

1111
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,278
I'm Scuba Sam.

1112
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,033
Scuba Steve's father.

1113
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,508
You see, my boy...

1114
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,398
...needs to take a bath.

1115
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,199
The only problem is...

1116
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,351
...he's afraid to bathe alone.

1117
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,079
So I was wondering...

1118
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,676
...if maybe you could keep him company
in the tub.

1119
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,310
Terrific.

1120
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,513
And after the bath, you have to try
and study hard.

1121
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,276
Because if you wanna be a member of
the Scuba Squad, you have to be smart.

1122
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,516
I could be in the Scuba Squad?

1123
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,070
Well, sure. All you have to do
is work hard.

1124
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,788
And don't tell a soul
about the Scuba Squad...

1125
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,110
...because then everybody will
wanna join.

1126
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,759
And one more thing...

1127
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,150
...be nice to the delivery guy,
would you?

1128
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,112
It's not his fault he can't read.

1129
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,558
Take care.

1130
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,870
He told me to watch his boat for him.
Said that he wanted to...

1131
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,680
...talk to you about
some secret mission.

1132
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,469
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1133
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,790
How come I have to wear
a bathing suit?

1134
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,473
I don't know the rules...

1135
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,793
...with little kids and grownups
and being naked and just sit down.

1136
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,271
The good news is you're not
smelling like a foot anymore.

1137
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,115
I read something interesting.
You know Benjamin Franklin invented...

1138
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,271
...bifocals? That's pretty cool.

1139
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,430
What are they?

1140
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,559
I'll show you in that book. It might
help you out with your school play.

1141
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,958
We'll make this a regular thing.

1142
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,192
Bathing and studying
and eating right.

1143
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,954
Put your head back.
My grandmother did this to me.

1144
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,751
"Oh, boy. When I was a little girl,
frankfurters only cost a nickel."

1145
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,149
Can you still have fun?

1146
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,992
Yeah, but after you study.

1147
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,118
In fact, we gotta get you
dressing differently.

1148
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,839
We'll go to Barney's.

1149
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,553
Not that Barney.
A more expensive Barney.

1150
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,512
All right, one at a time.

1151
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,193
That's one.

1152
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,828
Two.

1153
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,034
See? Urinals are good too.

1154
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,313
"Electricity."

1155
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,516
Very good.

1156
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,875
"Constitution."

1157
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,235
That's it.

1158
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,629
"Philadelphia."

1159
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,949
Smart. Good.

1160
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,590
"Fish"?

1161
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,789
"Pony"?

1162
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,630
"Hip..."

1163
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,510
"Hiphop..."

1164
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,275
"Hipopynonamous"?

1165
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,559
Damn you! You gave him the easy ones!

1166
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,319
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.

1167
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,750
Slow down.

1168
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,198
You owe me a Sausage McMuffin.

1169
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,235
There's a pole there.

1170
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,431
My name is Alexander Hamilton.

1171
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,354
I was the first secretary
of the treasury.

1172
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,875
I owned a bank and a newspaper.

1173
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,315
Aaron Bird shot me.

1174
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,509
Hi, my name is Benjamin Franklin.

1175
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,348
I was a writer, a diplomat...

1176
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,756
...an inventor and a statesman...

1177
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,754
...although I only went to school
for two years.

1178
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,152
I wrote many books and invented
many things we still use today.

1179
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,230
The Declaration of Independence
is finished.

1180
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,438
Who will be the first to sign?

1181
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,951
- How about you, John Hancock?
- I want to sign!

1182
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,600
- Look at my man stand strong.
- He's so cute.

1183
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,349
What are your cards?

1184
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:06,116
I got a six, a five, a jack,
a four and a eight.

1185
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,356
I win.

1186
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,476
What do you mean?

1187
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,950
I had a hand just like that.
I didn't win.

1188
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,076
Because I win.

1189
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,548
This is bullshit!

1190
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,358
All right. Take it easy, man.

1191
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,192
Every time it's different cards.

1192
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,839
So what? Relax. He's a kid.

1193
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,397
There should be same set of rules,
no matter what age.

1194
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,596
He's gotta learn how to lose too.

1195
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,269
- Hello, Mr. Koufax.
- Mr. Brooks, how you doing?

1196
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,158
I was gonna give you a buzz.

1197
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,754
You just called me Mr. Koufax,
didn't you?

1198
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,956
It is your name, isn't it?
Sonny Koufax?

1199
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,589
You held yourself out
to be Kevin Gerrity...

1200
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,717
...to gain custody of young Julian.

1201
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,678
Big problem in this state.

1202
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,558
I've delivered to you before.

1203
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,075
You always order
three pieces of cheesecake.

1204
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,519
The real Kevin Gerrity
asked me to take care of...

1205
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,478
Save it, Mr. Koufax.

1206
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,950
He has to come with me
or I'll arrest you.

1207
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,394
Take out your handcuffs.

1208
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,359
I don't have any,
but two policemen downstairs do.

1209
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,990
Listen, Sonny, I would like to help...

1210
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,835
...but my status in your country
is not what you would call legal.

1211
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,115
It's okay.

1212
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,509
I'm Audi.

1213
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,433
Julian, you're gonna have to
come with me.

1214
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,998
One second, pal.

1215
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,156
Would you just give me a second
to say goodbye to the kid?

1216
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,195
Take a second.

1217
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,390
You don't want me here anymore?

1218
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,432
No, that's not it, pal.

1219
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,796
You just gotta go away
for a little while.

1220
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,395
How long am I going away for?

1221
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,517
I don't wanna lie to you.

1222
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,432
I don't think we're gonna...

1223
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,956
...be seeing each other anymore.

1224
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,113
I screwed up, pal. I'm so sorry.

1225
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,268
Come here.

1226
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,075
Put your coat on.

1227
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,949
It's not your fault, okay?
I'm the idiot.

1228
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,191
- I don't wanna go.
- I know you don't.

1229
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,749
But you have to,
and you're gonna be okay.

1230
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,636
Please don't make me go.

1231
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,155
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what else to do.

1232
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,755
I won't play
the kangaroo song anymore.

1233
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,594
Come on.

1234
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,398
Just go. You gotta go.

1235
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,789
You gotta go.

1236
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,869
I don't wanna go. I promise...

1237
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,953
...I'm sorry. I don't even
like that song anymore.

1238
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,111
I know, pal. That's not it.

1239
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,397
But I wipe my own ass!
I wipe my own ass!

1240
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,439
I know.

1241
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,070
- Layla, they took the kid.
- Who?

1242
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,709
Social Services.
I gotta get him back.

1243
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,678
You said this was just temporary.

1244
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,639
I can't have it be temporary.
It's gotta be permanent.

1245
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,518
Okay, what can we do?

1246
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,957
I filed to get custody based
on the child's best interests.

1247
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,795
Tommy knew a clerk, so they fast-tracked
the hearing. It's Tuesday.

1248
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,792
- This Tuesday?
- You got work?

1249
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,918
I gotta go to Washington
for a hearing to dismiss my case.

1250
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,639
Can you get somebody else?

1251
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,189
I'm sorry, Sonny.
I can't. It's my case.

1252
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,432
We don't even know where
this kid's gonna end up.

1253
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,956
Sonny, this is exactly why
I didn't wanna get involved.

1254
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,077
I had things going the way I wanted.

1255
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,949
Then at the park, you and this kid
come barging into my life...

1256
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,033
...and it's screwing up everything
I had planned.

1257
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,078
You think I planned on a kid
showing up on my doorstep?

1258
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,799
But I fell in love with him.

1259
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,991
So now my plans have changed.

1260
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,159
All rise.

1261
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,954
We're here to determine
proper custody of Julian McGrath...

1262
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,192
...also known as Julian Gerrity,
a minor child.

1263
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,919
Representing New York City?

1264
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,479
Ted Castellucci.

1265
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,472
Arthur Brooks, Social Services.

1266
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,551
And representing Sonny Koufax?

1267
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,835
Phillip D'Amato.

1268
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,035
Thomas Grayton.

1269
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,788
Plus, I'll pretty much
be representing myself.

1270
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:10,950
Anyone else?

1271
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,350
Layla Maloney, Your Honor.

1272
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,836
Does this mean that you love me?

1273
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,513
Something like that.

1274
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,759
First witness.

1275
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,560
Koufax is a good egg.
He was nice to that kid.

1276
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,391
But he fights like a girl.

1277
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,436
You like that?

1278
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,318
I'm right here, miss.

1279
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,278
What are you gonna do about it?

1280
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,678
Are you drunk, Mr. Herlihy?

1281
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,434
I had a few chardonnays. What of it?

1282
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,474
Get off the stand.

1283
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,188
You got it.

1284
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,153
I've got a few problems.

1285
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,749
Off to a good start.

1286
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,596
Mr. Koufax is a really cool guy.
I wish my dad was as cool as him.

1287
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,432
My dad was a military man.

1288
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,112
Guess I wasn't such a "good soldier."

1289
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,116
When I was 35, he attempted to give me
a crew cut while I was sleeping.

1290
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,755
I broke his arm,
haven't seen him since.

1291
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,118
I'd rather live on the streets
than under his rules.

1292
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,678
Anyway, I think Mr. Koufax should be
acquitted of all the charges.

1293
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,509
If O.J. can get away with murder,
why can't Sonny have his kid?

1294
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,871
This guy knows what I'm talking about.

1295
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,718
No more questions.

1296
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,588
How long have you delivered food
to Mr. Koufax?

1297
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,432
I deliver food for six years.

1298
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,558
Plus, I'm stripper.
But I've put on weight so it's problem.

1299
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,713
I see. And in your experience,
was Sonny a good father to Julian?

1300
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,520
Oh, yes. They make terrific pair.

1301
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,115
They went together like
lamb and tuna fish.

1302
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,353
Lamb and tuna fish?

1303
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,350
Spaghetti and meatball?
You more comfortable with that analogy?

1304
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,716
Yes, considering we're in America.

1305
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,428
If you don't like spaghetti
and meatballs, get out.

1306
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,079
I'll come give you a crew cut.

1307
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,634
Let's see your clippers.

1308
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,598
Not my problem your dad was sick.

1309
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,359
Stop yelling at me!

1310
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,749
Order! Order! Order!

1311
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,433
Am I in the right room?

1312
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,715
Who the hell are you?

1313
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,552
I'm Mr. Koufax's co-counsel.

1314
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,392
He has enough co-counsels.

1315
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,436
Well...

1316
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,589
...one more won't hurt.

1317
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,159
Let's get on with it.

1318
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,278
Mr. Koufax is simply parading
his buddies up there.

1319
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,795
Can't they find someone
who isn't a friend?

1320
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,190
What were Julian
and Mr. Koufax doing?

1321
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,356
Shopping.

1322
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,319
Did he appear to be
an attentive, loving father?

1323
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,959
He certainly did.

1324
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,396
And how long have you
disliked Mr. Koufax?

1325
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,789
Since the day I met him.

1326
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,998
For the record, where did you work
during medical school?

1327
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,714
Hooters.

1328
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,192
No further questions.

1329
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,468
Asshole.

1330
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,914
Next witness.

1331
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,431
We'd like to call Julian McGrath.

1332
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,991
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

1333
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,992
This is just you and me talking...

1334
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,196
...so don't pay attention to
these people.

1335
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,396
Can you tell me how old you are?

1336
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,678
Your Honor, one second.

1337
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,832
That's better, huh?

1338
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,672
Can you tell me
how old you are?

1339
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,155
Five.

1340
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,628
What's your birthday?

1341
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,472
July 15th.

1342
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,755
Where were you born?

1343
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,989
Toronto.

1344
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,549
Toronto? I thought you were
from Buffalo.

1345
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,520
I moved to Buffalo with my mommy.

1346
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,718
For the past six weeks, you've been
living with Sonny?

1347
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,278
Did you and Sonny have fun?

1348
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,272
What kind of things would you do?

1349
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,274
He taught me how to do the sleeper hold
like Chief Jay Strongbow.

1350
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,028
That's nice.

1351
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,269
Anything else?

1352
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,715
He taught me how to pee on a building.

1353
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,195
Really?

1354
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:27,117
And he taught me that Styx was
one of the greatest American rock bands.

1355
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,032
They only caught a bad rap...

1356
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,590
...because most critics
are cynical assholes.

1357
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,116
I think we'd all agree with that.

1358
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,278
Before you came here, do you remember
the last thing your mommy said to you?

1359
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,910
That she loved me and I was gonna
live with my new daddy.

1360
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,913
If your mother could pick anyone
to be your new daddy...

1361
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,354
...who would she pick?

1362
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,113
Sonny.

1363
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,189
Thank you, Julian.

1364
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,759
You can step down now.

1365
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,152
That went good, don't you think?

1366
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,273
I don't know.
Judge doesn't look too happy.

1367
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,875
Mr. Koufax, anyone else?

1368
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,670
I'd like to call upon myself,
Your Honor.

1369
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,069
Awesome.

1370
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,312
Which of your esteemed co-counsels
will examine you?

1371
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,430
My father, Lenny Koufax.

1372
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,749
What?

1373
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,519
Forget it, Sonny.

1374
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,113
What is going on?

1375
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,433
Nobody in this world thinks I shouldn't
have a child more than that man.

1376
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,110
He also happens to be
a well-respected lawyer in Florida.

1377
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:41,319
If I can make a believer out of him,
I can make a believer out of everybody.

1378
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,872
This court is after the truth, not
the opinion of the defendant's father.

1379
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,350
You want my opinion?
My son is a moron.

1380
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,875
I withdraw my objection.
Please proceed.

1381
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,238
This is a big mistake.

1382
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,996
I only came today to make sure
you didn't end up in jail.

1383
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,958
That was nice of you. Thank you.

1384
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,919
To do what I think is right here.

1385
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,549
Cut your fingernails.
They're too long.

1386
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,710
Okay, Dad.

1387
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,279
This case is simple.

1388
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,757
It is absurd to think that Sonny Koufax
is ready to raise a child.

1389
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,592
- Objection!
- Shut up, Tommy.

1390
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,679
Sorry, Mr. Koufax.

1391
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,958
First of all, how did...

1392
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,591
...this sweet little boy, Julian,
end up under your supervision?

1393
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,672
I told Social Services
that my name was Kevin Gerrity.

1394
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,195
- Of course, you are not Kevin Gerrity.
- No.

1395
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,873
- So you lied.
- Yes.

1396
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,953
Like the time I found a bag of pot
in your drawer...

1397
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,919
...and you said you thought
they were pencil shavings.

1398
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,317
Remember when I told you Aunt Fay
was coming to New York...

1399
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,676
...and I wanted you to
show her the city?

1400
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,275
And you said that you had
better things to do.

1401
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,555
That's right.

1402
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,554
I'm curious. Just what were those
better things that you had to do?

1403
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:03,633
Jethro Tull had a reunion concert
in New Jersey, so I caught that.

1404
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,916
What happened to Aunt Fay
that weekend?

1405
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,715
She died.

1406
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,870
Yes, she did.

1407
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,669
Did you happen to make it
to her funeral?

1408
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,276
Why not?

1409
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,195
I went to Jones Beach,
got drunk and fell asleep.

1410
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,395
Hell, yes!

1411
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,795
Some role model.

1412
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,954
Your Honor...

1413
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,556
...my son doesn't have health insurance.

1414
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,631
He doesn't know how to boil an egg.

1415
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,270
He filed for social security
at the age of 30.

1416
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,633
He is a drain on the economy,
on the country...

1417
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,552
...and most of all, on me!

1418
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:44,870
Your Honor...

1419
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,315
...to give this young man...

1420
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:52,115
...custody over another life
is not only wrong...

1421
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,469
...it's insane.

1422
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,115
I love you.

1423
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,596
What?

1424
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,156
Don't be scared. It's all right.

1425
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,719
I'm not scared.

1426
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,918
If I get custody of Julian,
I'll be his father forever.

1427
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,790
That scares you because you think
there's a good chance I'll fail.

1428
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,794
Sonny, it's more than a chance.
It's a certainty.

1429
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,189
You're wrong, Dad.

1430
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,713
You can be scared that I might get
pickpocketed in a bad neighborhood...

1431
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,757
...or break my legs skiing.

1432
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,629
But don't be scared about me
being a dad, because I will not fail.

1433
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,718
I love this kid too much.

1434
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,315
I love him as much as
you love me, Dad.

1435
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,108
I'm gonna give him advice
and I'm gonna guide him...

1436
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,430
...and I'll be there
whenever he needs me.

1437
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,439
I'll fly to New York to be
at his court case...

1438
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,433
...even if I disagree with
why he's there.

1439
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,912
But, Sonny, you work in a tollbooth.

1440
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,428
Don't worry about money.

1441
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,717
I am in love with a beautiful girl
who makes plenty of it.

1442
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,156
She'll be my sugar mama.

1443
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,913
I gotta get me one of those.

1444
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,470
I know this is the right thing
because I would die for this kid...

1445
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,075
...just so he won't feel
one ounce of sadness.

1446
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,472
That's why you're here right now,
to protect me, to be scared for me...

1447
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,677
...to be a good father.

1448
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,835
And that's exactly what I'm gonna be.

1449
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,793
Hello, Dad?

1450
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,395
Yeah, I just wanted to say I love you.

1451
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,951
Hi, Mom? Could you put Dad
on the phone for a second?

1452
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,071
Can I borrow that when you're done?

1453
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,273
Your Honor...

1454
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,272
...my son deserves this kid.

1455
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,432
I love you too, sir.

1456
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,918
Mr. Koufax...

1457
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,749
...the fact is
you kidnapped this child.

1458
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,718
Not only shouldn't you get custody...

1459
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,918
...but since you obtained him
by defrauding the state...

1460
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,071
...you should be in jail.

1461
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,710
Bailiff, remand him until
I can figure out the punishment.

1462
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,791
Wait. You can't take him away.

1463
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,199
As that boy's father,
I refuse to press charges.

1464
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,954
Oh, God. Corinne, I'm sorry.

1465
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,555
Six years ago, Joe Carter...

1466
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,835
Joe Carter?

1467
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,230
Toronto and the Phillies.
World Series.

1468
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,989
Mitch Williams...
We flew up for the night.

1469
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,039
There was a girl.

1470
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,156
Oh, God.

1471
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,709
I'm an idiot. I was so hammered.

1472
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,997
Chicken wings, Molson 3-0.
Canadian beer is like moonshine.

1473
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,309
Hell, yes.

1474
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,835
You remember?
It was at that Toronto Hooters.

1475
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,114
That was before he met you.
That Hooters thing is a coincidence.

1476
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,634
I'm sorry, Corinne.

1477
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,634
I know this changes everything,
but I had to do the right thing.

1478
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,914
Mr. Castellucci.

1479
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,916
Pending a blood test, I...

1480
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,030
Whatever.

1481
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,910
The court grants custody to Kevin
Gerrity, pending the DNA test results.

1482
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,552
I want you to be my dad, Sonny.

1483
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,791
I know. I do too, pal.

1484
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,953
But I'm not sure that can happen
exactly the way we want it.

1485
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,919
Because it seems you
already have a daddy.

1486
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,316
But I'll tell you what I can do.

1487
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,831
I can be your friend, no matter what.
All right?

1488
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,718
I'll always be your friend.

1489
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,599
I'll always be your family.
I'll always be around.

1490
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,433
I promise.

1491
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,472
The kid's good at tying his shoes.

1492
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,631
He's not great at it,
so work with him.

1493
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,474
- I'll teach him bunny ears.
- What's bunny ears?

1494
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,029
Make bunny ears,
cross and pull them through.

1495
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,590
I go with this loop, swoop
and pull thing. He likes that.

1496
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,559
- I don't know that.
- Go with the loop, swoop and pull.

1497
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,438
I swear to God it's working.

1498
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,835
All right.

1499
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,353
Go with the bunny ears thing.
You're his dad, right? I'm sorry.

1500
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,068
It's important, when you eat
at my restaurant...

1501
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,356
...you never order BLT.

1502
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,114
You must trust me.
Stay away from BLT, okay?

1503
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,395
Hey, guys.

1504
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,995
I'm gonna leave you
with your dad now, Julian.

1505
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,674
He's a good man.
I've known him my whole life.

1506
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,673
So you two have fun
and I'll see you in the morning.

1507
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:20,989
All right?

1508
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,312
- Quit scaring the kid for a minute.
- Who am I scaring?

1509
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,039
Bye, pal.

1510
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,750
I went to China.
Do you know where that is?

1511
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,433
It's in Asia, which is...

1512
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,280
...by Europe.
I brought some cool stuff back.

1513
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,831
Did you move the bench?

1514
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,715
That's pretty funny.

1515
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,952
You know what I got?
Some noisemakers. Check this out.

1516
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,433
Wanna try one?

1517
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,319
That's my foot!

1518
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,679
You're nice man.

1519
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,032
I've got Spice Channel.
It's blurry but it's nice.

1520
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,636
Let's make this quick.
I gotta get to work.

1521
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,519
Holy shit. Sonny Koufax
would rather work than eat.

1522
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,799
I'm working on a big case.
I gotta sue you for making me come here.

1523
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,718
Surprise!

1524
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,993
Did you just waste
the good surprise on me again?

1525
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,279
Hi, Corinne.

1526
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,670
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, everybody.

1527
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,558
Hey, you guys. How are you?

1528
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,597
Happy birthday, Daddy.

1529
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,194
How you doing, cutie?

1530
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,079
Sonny, I beat you so bad
in basketball yesterday.

1531
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,834
From now on, I have to
stop letting you win.

1532
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,991
I stopped that months ago.
He still wins.

1533
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,992
That's because you suck.

1534
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,518
Corinne, put a tank top on
for old time's sake.

1535
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,320
- What is he talking about, Mommy?
- Nothing.

1536
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,354
- Happy birthday, Sonny.
- Thank you.

1537
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,555
It's a clock radio.

1538
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,950
- Thanks for telling me.
- I have to split.

1539
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,269
I got deliveries.

1540
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,397
Hang out with us. We'll have fun.

1541
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,518
No, I can't stay.
I'll hang for a little bit.

1542
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,035
There you go. Come on,
let's eat, everybody.

1543
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,475
Hey, you! Still missing
that tooth, huh?

1544
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:36,909
Can we get some fries?

1545
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:39,909
Vanessa.

1546
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,673
You're a Hooters girl?

1547
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,229
What happened to Sid's five-year plan?

1548
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,991
How you doing?

1549
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,394
- Maybe it's a 10-year plan.
- Is that the guy with the old balls?

1550
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,516
I think it is.

1551
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,679
Come on. I bet they're nice.

1552
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,555
You're not supposed to say "balls."
Testicles.
