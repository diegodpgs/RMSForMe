1
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:40,320
Back up! Back up!

2
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:03,859
Fans, it's the bottom of the ninth.
and the bases are loaded.

3
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:06,221
And guess who the orphans
have at bat!

4
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,143
That's right.
It's the home-run queen herself.

5
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:12,266
The Belter from the Shelter. Miss--

6
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,267
Amanda Lemmon!

7
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,548
-What?
-I'm going to kill you!

8
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,030
Didn't I tell you
not to play in that dress?

9
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,273
Come on, Diane!
I ain't going to hurt it.

10
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,716
It's time for your interview.
Drop the bat. Let's go!

11
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,798
Just let me smash
this ball downtown, okay?

12
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,240
All right. you got 10 seconds.

13
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,484
Otherwise, the game is going to be
called on account of bloodshed!

14
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:37,766
Come on, Frankie.
I got to go to Staten Island.

15
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:40,048
Staten Island?
What about camp?

16
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,369
You'll miss the bus!

17
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,451
I won't. It's just a look-see.

18
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:46,213
They're trying to place you
with the Butkises?!

19
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,575
So what if they are?

20
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:51,938
You ever met those people?
That family collects kids.

21
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,339
They'll take anybody.

22
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,260
Even rejects like you.

23
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,383
Shut up, Frankie!
At least I got an interview.

24
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,906
And Amanda Butkis steps to the plate.

25
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:57,430
-Come on. Hop in.
-It was a grand slam!

26
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,151
See if they want a little boy!

27
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:00,873
Me and her. Two for one.

28
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,234
What am I, on sale?

29
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:03,875
Get your own!

30
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:07,958
Staten Island, please.

31
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:12,282
You're out. We win!

32
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,724
Amanda didn't touch home plate!

33
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:18,327
You're a dead man, Frankie!

34
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,299
Okay, so...

35
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,781
...it's not Park Avenue.

36
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:38,062
You can't judge a book by the cover.

37
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:40,584
You don't want to
be an orphan forever.

38
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:44,027
-So adopt me, why don't you?
-They won't let me, on my salary.

39
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:47,230
Besides that, you deserve
a mother and a father.

40
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,951
So get a husband!

41
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:51,353
It's not like buying a car, you know!

42
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:54,516
I know. It's got to be that
''Can't eat, can't sleep...

43
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:58,919
...reach for the stars.
World Series'' kind of stuff, right?

44
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,721
A girl has her standards.

45
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,804
Well, I got mine. And I say.
let's blow off these people!

46
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:08,767
Gum.

47
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:10,168
Hat.

48
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,411
Other gum.

49
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:19,496
Look. I know these people
have a stupid name...

50
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,898
...but they really like kids.

51
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:23,819
Okay? So put on a smile.

52
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,422
Sell it, girl!

53
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:30,224
Why do I always got to wear a dress?

54
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:33,627
Because it makes you
look so pretty.

55
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,996
Oh, isn't she the most precious thing?

56
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:47,478
What a pretty little dress!

57
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,841
She's a honey! Look.
she's got your mother's smile.

58
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,885
And your father's sense of humor.

59
00:05:58,086 --> 00:05:59,528
That's very funny!

60
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:00,849
Come on in!

61
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,410
Come in, sweetie!

62
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,814
Why, you'll love it in here!
It's going to be fabulous.

63
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:38,159
Callaway, huh?

64
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,360
Must be a real big shot.

65
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,842
You'd be surprised how big.

66
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,688
All this for her?

67
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,738
Welcome home, princess.

68
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:05,901
He forgot again, didn't he?

69
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:09,664
I'm afraid your father's
been unavoidably detained.

70
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:11,145
If it's any consolation...

71
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,388
...I know an old butler
who's mighty glad to see you.

72
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,150
I'm sorry, Vincenzo.

73
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,432
How terribly rude of me!

74
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:21,633
I'm very glad to see you too.

75
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:23,355
Thank you, honey.

76
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,437
I see you've been practicing.
Congratulations!

77
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:27,918
What's his excuse?

78
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:30,200
Your father? Well...

79
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,603
...he's preparing for your arrival
up at the summer house.

80
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:35,604
-Which one?
-Lake Minocqua.

81
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,127
But that's been closed for years.
He never goes there.

82
00:07:39,648 --> 00:07:41,169
He does now.

83
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:44,051
Vincenzo, you big fat fibber!
What's going on?

84
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:46,934
My lips are sealed.

85
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:49,295
You mean it's a surprise?

86
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:51,817
You could put it that way.

87
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:53,859
It's a welcome home party for me!

88
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,421
I knew Daddy was up to something.

89
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:58,623
Alyssa, I didn't say--

90
00:07:58,903 --> 00:07:59,744
I won't tell.

91
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:03,187
I've never had a surprise party
in my whole life!

92
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:08,551
Well, this'll certainly
be a surprise.

93
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,954
Come on, move it!

94
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:17,518
-I got 43.
-Me too. Guess who's missing?

95
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:19,600
Carmen, where's Amanda?

96
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,201
She's not coming.

97
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:27,926
Hey, slugger. What's up?

98
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,809
I'm not going to stupid camp.

99
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,653
I don't blame you.
Look at this place. It's a pigsty!

100
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:38,054
It'll take you a week
to make your bed.

101
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:40,256
Don't joke. I'm serious.

102
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:41,817
I'm not joking.

103
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:45,300
That's why I sent
the bus ahead without us.

104
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,541
Liar.

105
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:49,424
-How much you want to bet?
-Fifty bucks.

106
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,586
-Okay. so I didn't send the bus.
-Cough it up.

107
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:54,107
But I will.

108
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:58,351
Then we can sit here until
you tell me what's really wrong.

109
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:02,314
I'm not going
to stupid Butkis' either.

110
00:09:03,155 --> 00:09:04,996
I was waiting for that one.

111
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:10,921
If they're the best I can do.
Frankie's right. I am a reject.

112
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:15,244
You're not a reject.

113
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:18,207
It's just that most people
want to adopt....

114
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:19,648
Babies.

115
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,169
I know.

116
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:24,852
This orphan stuff is
like growing up in a dog pound.

117
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,573
Everybody wants a puppy.

118
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,536
Just once. I'd like to sleep
in my own room.

119
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,339
Hey, come here a minute.
Listen to me.

120
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:35,220
You listening to me?

121
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:41,145
I'm going to find you the best home
in the entire world.

122
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:42,906
That's a promise.

123
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:46,990
You don't make promises, remember?

124
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,234
I didn't say I don't make promises.
I don't make promises I can't keep.

125
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:53,955
There's a big difference.

126
00:09:56,757 --> 00:09:59,520
Now can we please go to camp?

127
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,641
Please?

128
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,127
But you still owe me $50.

129
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:04,572
Oh, Vincenzo, it's gorgeous!

130
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:07,454
I think this house is going
to be my favorite.

131
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:11,177
I remember many happy years here.

132
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:13,219
-There she is.
-Daddy!

133
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,301
Come over here, my little--

134
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:18,102
Wait a minute!

135
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:22,386
You're not Alyssa. She's little.
You're a foot taller than her.

136
00:11:22,546 --> 00:11:23,707
It's me. Honest!

137
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,108
It is?

138
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,912
I've missed you.
I'm sorry I wasn't at the airport.

139
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:33,795
That's okay. I knew it had
to be something really important.

140
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:36,117
Like a party, maybe?

141
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,359
She knows?

142
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,120
I didn't say a thing!

143
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:44,243
Vincenzo didn't tell me.
I figured it out on my own.

144
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:47,686
I should have let you surprise me.
but I'm too excited.

145
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,327
You are?

146
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,329
It's still on, isn't it?

147
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:54,011
Of course it's still on, sweetheart.

148
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,573
But are we talking
about the same party?

149
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:00,176
Roger, she's darling!

150
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:03,779
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Clarice Kensington.

151
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,421
Hello, Miss Kensington.
How do you do?

152
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:10,985
What a perfect little girl!

153
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:14,067
Roger, I'm absolutely smitten!

154
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:18,311
You and I are going
to be great friends.

155
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:19,912
Are you here for my party?

156
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,434
Your party?

157
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:26,797
Roger, don't tell me
you haven't told her?

158
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:28,279
Told me what?

159
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:33,323
Sweetheart, the party is not for--

160
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:36,485
Another couple of hours.

161
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:38,887
Let's get you settled in, princess.

162
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:40,849
Yes, why don't you do that?

163
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:44,572
I'm sure you two have lots
to talk about.

164
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:48,815
He didn't tell her.
I can't believe he didn't tell her.

165
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,217
Maybe he wanted
to tell her in person.

166
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:55,340
I'm sorry.
Did I say something to you?

167
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:18,399
Remember to bring your own bag.
Everybody off!

168
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,969
Yo, Carmen, you blind?

169
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,250
What?

170
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:39,055
Girl, when you going
to get a life?

171
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,623
Miss Kensington seems nice.
Does she work with you?

172
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:52,866
Not exactly.

173
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,470
I got something to show you.

174
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,231
Right up here.

175
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,074
You see there? Across the lake?

176
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,516
That's Camp Callaway.
That was your mom's favorite project.

177
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:07,998
So is she from the camp?

178
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,279
Who?

179
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,201
Miss Kensington.

180
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:13,763
Sweetheart...

181
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:16,365
...I want to have a talk with you.

182
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:21,729
You know, Alyssa...

183
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,971
...a lot's happened
while you were gone.

184
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:29,536
I haven't been able to come up
to this house since Mom passed away.

185
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,979
But there comes a time
when a person has to move on.

186
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,541
You're getting older.

187
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:39,824
There's just so much
a father can do without help.

188
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:42,906
-We have Vincenzo. He helps us.
-Yes, he does.

189
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:46,389
He's been a good friend
to this family for a long time.

190
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,152
But what I think
our family needs is a--

191
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:53,395
Excuse me.
Telephone. Board meeting.

192
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,877
-Let me call them back, okay?
-It's urgent.

193
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:57,198
I'm with my--

194
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,002
Forgive me?

195
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:03,523
Don't I always?

196
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,966
So good to have you home.

197
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:12,010
On two?

198
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,613
Hey, young lady!

199
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:18,695
Summer vacation. Official.
Go play!

200
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:20,496
Will you come with me?

201
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:24,540
I wish I could, but I got
a lot of work to do. Sorry.

202
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:41,793
Check it out!
Buckingham Palace.

203
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:45,556
That's in London, brainless.
It's the Callaway house.

204
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,879
Nobody's lived there for years.
It's haunted.

205
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,082
-It's not either!
-Ask anyone. Every full moon...

206
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:55,484
...old lady Callaway's ghost crosses
the lake and eats a camper.

207
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:59,648
Yeah, right. And Santa Claus lives
with the tooth fairy in Oueens.

208
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:01,689
-You ever been there?
-No.

209
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:05,412
If it's not haunted.
why don't you go ring the doorbell?

210
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:08,135
-You think I'm scared?
-Five bucks says you're chicken.

211
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:09,776
Cough it up, choirboy!

212
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:11,938
Show me your money.

213
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:13,899
This I got to see!

214
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:38,038
They say the first Mrs. Callaway
was a lovely woman...

215
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,521
...but look at this room!

216
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:45,204
No wonder she's dead!
She had absolutely no taste.

217
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:47,006
I can't wait to sell this house.

218
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:51,209
I want one bar set up in here
and two out in the patio.

219
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:57,814
Well, hello, munchkin!

220
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:09,504
Daddy!

221
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,866
Honey, what's the matter?

222
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:17,390
-You all right?
-No!

223
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,591
What?

224
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,032
What happened?

225
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,314
She hates this house!

226
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:27,158
Let's not be dramatic, darling.
She was hiding in the den.

227
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:31,401
I simply said that
we might fix it up someday.

228
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,683
That is, if you'll let me.

229
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:36,565
Who is she?

230
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:45,492
There's no easy way to say this.

231
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,858
Sweetheart...

232
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:55,500
...Clarice and l
will be married next month.

233
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:00,745
You'll finally have a real family.
She's going to be your new mother.

234
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:01,946
lsn't that wonderful?

235
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:13,795
She does this sometimes.

236
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:17,478
-Honey.
-And she gets away with it.

237
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,721
I'm sorry. Roger, but little tantrums
mustn't be rewarded.

238
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,844
Come on, sweetheart.

239
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:26,285
You're making it worse.

240
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:29,007
I know what I'm talking about.

241
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:31,769
All right, people!

242
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,211
Back to work, Shoo!

243
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,573
Let's focus on the engagement party.

244
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:38,735
Sure hope you're right.

245
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:43,979
Trust me, I'm a woman.

246
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:50,224
Look at the time!
I've got to get my face on.

247
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:57,150
How's about some milk and cookies?

248
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,993
I've lost my mother.
Now I've lost my father.

249
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:02,594
I have no family!

250
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:05,076
I'm an orphan, and I'm running away!

251
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,758
And don't you dare tell Daddy!

252
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:11,121
-We got to hide!
-What if we get caught?

253
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:12,802
-Don't let her see us!
-Who?

254
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:13,843
Old lady Callaway!

255
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,885
There's no ghost.

256
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:17,686
Look at her!

257
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:20,849
She's nuts!

258
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,854
I won't go back.

259
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:29,416
I won't!

260
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:31,457
She's not the boss of me.

261
00:19:32,018 --> 00:19:33,619
Have you seen Alyssa?

262
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:36,982
I'm under strict orders
not to tell you that she ran away.

263
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,343
Why didn't you stop her?

264
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:44,187
I thought I'd give her a head start
so she could reclaim a little dignity.

265
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:47,030
You'll make sure she comes home okay?

266
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,911
Don't worry.
Right away, boss.

267
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,633
Thanks, Vin.

268
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:54,996
It doesn't look haunted.

269
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,398
That's what they want you to think.

270
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:59,760
This isn't funny.
Let's get out of here!

271
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,561
Don't worry!
She'll chicken out.

272
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:23,979
Well...

273
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,982
...if it isn't
the little orphan girl.

274
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:28,623
Someone's home!

275
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:31,065
We were just coming after you.

276
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:34,348
I didn't mean nothing!
It was just a joke.

277
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,269
I was just kidding around!

278
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:40,753
She didn't even scream.

279
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:43,275
Let's get you ready
for the big dinner.

280
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:44,315
Big dinner?

281
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,198
Listen, Lurch, you don't want me.
I'm too skinny!

282
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:48,559
There are other kids.

283
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:51,561
Big, fat ones, right outside.
Eat them!

284
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:55,564
What in the world
are you talking about?

285
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,892
The full moon.
That's tonight, right?

286
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:10,056
Old lady Callaway's ghost!

287
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,940
It's her!

288
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:23,107
I guess you think I'm stupid.

289
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:26,269
No, you're just a little upset.
that's all.

290
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:28,631
Looks like I just won five bucks.

291
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,753
So when's this party?
Am I invited?

292
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:33,675
Your dress is upstairs.

293
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,116
Cocktails are at five.

294
00:21:35,316 --> 00:21:37,318
Now if you'll excuse me, please.

295
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:39,119
A dress?

296
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,440
Me?

297
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:42,722
You got to be kidding!

298
00:21:47,646 --> 00:21:49,888
Nobody's even looking for me.

299
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:53,411
There you are!

300
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:57,134
I have been looking
everywhere for you!

301
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:58,495
You have?

302
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:00,416
Of course I have.

303
00:22:00,977 --> 00:22:02,578
Let me ask you a question.

304
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:05,621
You did not come
all the way up here...

305
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:08,663
...to sit around
like a bump on a log, did you?

306
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:10,464
No.

307
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,267
I guess not.

308
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,069
Come on, slugger.
the_re playing football.

309
00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:18,591
You're missing out on all the fun.

310
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,964
I thought, "Where is she?
What's happened to her?"

311
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:43,331
-I hear Amanda's quite the jock.
-The kid's a natural. Great speed.

312
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:47,134
Student body, left. Everybody block
for Amanda. On four. Ready?

313
00:22:47,414 --> 00:22:48,495
W

314
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,176
Who's Amanda?

315
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:51,537
Funny.

316
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:45,901
She's probably
eating her liver right now.

317
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:50,584
You think one camper's enough?
I mean, what if she's still hungry?

318
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:52,106
Look!

319
00:23:56,229 --> 00:23:57,670
Hey, I got it!

320
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,311
Run!

321
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:02,474
You're going the wrong way!

322
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:12,482
Great speed.

323
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:14,684
Bad sense of direction.

324
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:01,361
Do you see what I see?

325
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:04,564
I don't know what you see.
but what I see is me.

326
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,565
I see me, too.

327
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:09,928
Does that mean there's two of you?

328
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:11,850
Or two of me?

329
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:28,983
There really is two of us!

330
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:31,145
Don't you find this odd?

331
00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:35,388
No, this is weird.
This is really, really weird.

332
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:37,870
Wait a sec!

333
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,032
You live at the Callaway house!

334
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:42,314
You're that girl from camp!

335
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:44,916
They thought I was you!

336
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:47,718
Alyssa Callaway.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

337
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:49,600
Amanda, Put her there!

338
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,402
No wonder that penguin guy
asked me in!

339
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:55,524
That's Vincenzo. He's our butler.

340
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:57,406
Who's the woman with the long hair?

341
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,127
I liked her.

342
00:25:59,327 --> 00:26:02,690
That's Diane. We're buds.
She's pretty cool for a grownup.

343
00:26:04,572 --> 00:26:06,533
What were you doing over there?

344
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:10,456
I wanted to see what
it was like to be an orphan.

345
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:11,777
What?

346
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:14,380
-Why?
-Because it looked like fun .

347
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,743
Fun? Being an orphan?
What's the matter with you?

348
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:20,945
So why were you at my house?

349
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:24,227
I was just....

350
00:26:24,948 --> 00:26:26,589
I was just ringing the doorbell.

351
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,111
What for?

352
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:30,713
Because kids think
that place is haunted.

353
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:32,554
That's stupid.

354
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:35,917
Well, then who's
that scary blond lady?

355
00:26:36,837 --> 00:26:38,599
She's absolutely horrid!

356
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:42,042
-If I were you, I'd get rid of her.
-Any suggestions?

357
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:43,963
You're talking to a pro here!

358
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:47,566
I've driven away more possible parents
than you'll ever meet.

359
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,247
Don't you want a family?

360
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:51,850
A girl's got to have her standards.

361
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,053
So tell me, this party.
you really don't want to go?

362
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:58,175
I'd rather eat dirt.

363
00:26:58,335 --> 00:26:59,295
Okay, listen.

364
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,138
You be me, I'll be you.
One night only.

365
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:04,940
Tomorrow at noon, we switch back.
What do you say?

366
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,063
That's wonderful! That way.
you can scare off Clarice for me.

367
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:12,786
Don't be such a goody-goody.
I got a reputation to protect.

368
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,468
I scored a touchdown, didn't I?

369
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:17,590
Okay, just don't talk so good.

370
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,072
Use lousy English like:

371
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:23,795
Ain't ya never gonna wanna
doncha hafta go to the bathroom?

372
00:27:23,995 --> 00:27:24,956
That sort of thing.

373
00:27:25,717 --> 00:27:28,799
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

374
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,282
I say, you do catch on rather quickly.

375
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:35,564
Stables, noon.

376
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:06,829
Miss Kensington says
fashionably late was an hour ago.

377
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,471
What's the problem?

378
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:10,112
I'm a hairdresser...

379
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:12,234
...not a zookeeper.

380
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,362
What in the name of God
is going on here?

381
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:27,646
Hi, Vinnie. I mean, Vincenzo.

382
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:28,927
I got...

383
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,408
...distracted.

384
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,690
You don't have to apologize.

385
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:34,291
Really?

386
00:28:34,532 --> 00:28:35,933
Cool!

387
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:39,936
I mean, it's just that
I'm so terribly relieved that you...

388
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:41,938
...aren't pissed.

389
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,261
''pissed,'' miss?

390
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:54,468
Why don't you get dressed, please?
And let Carlo do your hair.

391
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:57,470
I liked it better when she fainted.

392
00:29:30,256 --> 00:29:32,098
This is really good!

393
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:35,781
Of course it is, silly.
It's your favorite.

394
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,142
It is?

395
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:39,424
Yes, of course.

396
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:45,108
The big, gooey, messy burger.

397
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:47,350
Also known as a sloppy joe.

398
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,632
Sloppy joe, Right.

399
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:52,394
Your favorite?

400
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:54,396
And with dern good reason!

401
00:29:56,317 --> 00:29:57,878
Did you just say ''dern''?

402
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,571
Good evening.

403
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,572
How swell of you to come!

404
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,654
So nice to see you.

405
00:30:17,854 --> 00:30:19,295
Like my dress?

406
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,178
Escargot, Miss Callaway?

407
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:24,700
Why, thank you, waiter person.

408
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,381
I'm starving.

409
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:29,384
I mean, I'd adore one!

410
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:35,268
This tastes like a balloon.

411
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:36,910
It's snails, miss.

412
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:39,552
Good.

413
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:41,673
Nice.

414
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:43,515
Chewy.

415
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:52,242
All this money
and these people eat slugs!

416
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:59,327
Look who's finally decided
to grace us with her presence!

417
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:02,810
Clarice, right?
You looked better with the mask.

418
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:04,812
I beg your pardon?

419
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:10,817
Clarice has been regaling us with
your accomplishments at the academy.

420
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:14,980
-Might we entice you to play something?
-Of course.

421
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,223
I'd be delighted!
Whatever did you have in mind?

422
00:31:19,464 --> 00:31:20,264
Checkers?

423
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,146
Dodge ball?

424
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:27,910
No, dear girl.

425
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:31,513
Muffy was referring to the piano.

426
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:36,918
Ladies and gentlemen.
may I have your attention, please?

427
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:40,921
Before we sit down to dinner.
my future stepdaughter...

428
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:43,643
...whom I absolutely adore...

429
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:46,325
...has consented to play
one of the pieces...

430
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:49,848
...that won her first prize
at the Windsor Academy youth recital.

431
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:58,415
Hold it! Time-out.
I can't play the piano.

432
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:00,376
I just told them you would.

433
00:32:00,697 --> 00:32:02,898
Then do me a grand favor
and untell them!

434
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:09,263
If you embarrass me
in front of all these people...

435
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:12,826
...I'll make sure that
you never play anything...

436
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,789
...ever again.
Have I made myself clear?

437
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,671
Clear as glass.

438
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:22,314
In fact, I can see right through you.

439
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:35,244
Ladies and gentlemen.

440
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:38,447
Normally, I'd be tickled
to play a selection...

441
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:39,848
...from...

442
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,249
...Chopin.

443
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:43,971
But in honor of my new stepmother...

444
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:47,374
...whom I absolutely adore...

445
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:51,817
...I decided to play
a little something of my own.

446
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:19,239
Do you think my daughter's
asking for attention?

447
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,561
I'd say she's demanding it.

448
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:28,327
Finn!

449
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,888
Huckleberry Finn!

450
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:31,249
You got it!

451
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:41,297
The guys are ahead of us
by eight seconds.

452
00:33:41,617 --> 00:33:44,660
-Amanda, it's your turn. Go, girl!
-Me?

453
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,542
You're the best.
Show them what you got.

454
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:03,835
Look at her. She's nervous!

455
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:04,996
Yeah, so?

456
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,558
The old Amanda wasn't
scared of nothing.

457
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:14,163
What am I supposed to do?

458
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:18,046
Ready.

459
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:19,608
Set.

460
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:20,889
Go!

461
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,211
Song!

462
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,542
What happened?

463
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:39,744
''London Bridge is Falling Down'' !

464
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:41,345
That's it!

465
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:02,762
You may enter.

466
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:05,484
Mind if we talk?

467
00:35:05,965 --> 00:35:07,606
Whatever about?

468
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:09,848
Clarice.

469
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,091
None of that.

470
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:17,894
She was upset with your performance.
Shouldn't you give her a chance?

471
00:35:18,175 --> 00:35:21,978
I did, and she's a big phoney-baloney.
if you ask me.

472
00:35:22,618 --> 00:35:26,061
I've never heard you this outspoken.
It'd be nice to have a mother.

473
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:31,265
Yeah, and it'd be nice
to have a father too. I mean--

474
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:35,148
No, no. Sweetheart. I think the
person you're really angry at...

475
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:36,109
...is me.

476
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:37,630
You?

477
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,392
What'd you do?

478
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:44,516
I haven't been much of a father lately.
I haven't seen you.

479
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:48,038
But all that's going to change.
Clarice is going back to the city.

480
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:51,241
Gee, I hope it was nothing I did.

481
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:56,045
No, she's got a wedding to plan, but
we'll get to spend some time together.

482
00:35:56,245 --> 00:35:58,847
Get to know each other again.
Is that okay?

483
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,931
Let's tuck you in.
you little snuggler.

484
00:36:06,293 --> 00:36:07,734
See you tomorrow.

485
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:11,657
Good night, honey.

486
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:15,500
I like having a father.

487
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:19,624
I like having a daughter.
Good night, sweetie.

488
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:27,830
Lights out!

489
00:36:30,432 --> 00:36:32,434
Lights out, cabin three!

490
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:50,528
-Come on, come on.
-This I got to see!

491
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:53,050
We're going to get caught.
I just know it!

492
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:57,174
Come on, Frankie. It's a full moon!

493
00:36:57,494 --> 00:37:01,257
Shut up, stupid!
lombies hear better than dogs.

494
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:15,068
It's a frog!

495
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:20,953
Amanda? Scared of a frog?
She's changed, all right!

496
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,474
Now do you believe me?

497
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:26,918
Yeah, she's one of them pod people.
Let's get out of here!

498
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,001
A frog?

499
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:32,882
You know what?

500
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:35,164
You should have kissed it.

501
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:38,087
He might've turned out
to be Prince Charming.

502
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:39,408
Grose!

503
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:41,129
Not for you. For me!

504
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:42,930
You'd kiss a frog?

505
00:37:43,131 --> 00:37:43,971
No.

506
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,293
Toads are my specialty.

507
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:49,336
Big, old, ugly suckers
with tongues like this.

508
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:50,697
-It is not.
-It is too!

509
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:54,340
-How else am I going to catch a guy?
-I don't know.

510
00:37:57,582 --> 00:37:58,903
There's that smile!

511
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:02,706
And that time. I think it went
all the way up to your eyes.

512
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:05,188
You remind me of someone.

513
00:38:05,268 --> 00:38:07,110
I do? Who?

514
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,071
Someone I've never met.

515
00:38:09,432 --> 00:38:11,153
How, if you've never met her?

516
00:38:11,553 --> 00:38:15,076
Sometimes when I dream.
I think I see her.

517
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:20,681
You know, you've been acting
just a little bit weirder today.

518
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:23,403
I think maybe it's all this fresh air.

519
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:25,244
Don't make fun.

520
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:27,486
Sorry.

521
00:38:27,846 --> 00:38:30,328
Usually you're such a tough guy.

522
00:38:30,528 --> 00:38:32,170
Don't tell anyone, okay?

523
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,731
Scout's honor.

524
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:37,934
I mean, after all, I wouldn't
want to spoil my reputation none.

525
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:39,336
None.

526
00:38:39,536 --> 00:38:40,456
I've got an idea.

527
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:43,219
Let's go spy on the boys.

528
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,113
Safe trip, honey.

529
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:40,745
Oh, my God!

530
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:44,556
How was the party?

531
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:47,518
Well, the good news is
Clarice is gone.

532
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:48,959
You did it!

533
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,962
The bad news is
she'll be back in a week.

534
00:40:52,122 --> 00:40:53,763
Oh, you didn't.

535
00:40:54,163 --> 00:40:57,606
What's a cool guy like your dad
doing with a witch like her?

536
00:40:57,806 --> 00:41:00,208
It's too bad he didn't
meet Diane first.

537
00:41:00,448 --> 00:41:02,050
Now, she's awesome.

538
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,052
Yeah, they'd be perfect
for each other.

539
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:11,617
You're not thinking what
I hope you're not thinking.

540
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,339
Want to bet?

541
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:15,060
But he's getting married!

542
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,543
They got to meet once.
Then they'll fall in love for sure.

543
00:41:18,703 --> 00:41:19,984
How do you know?

544
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,347
Because Diane says, when it happens.
it happens like that.

545
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:24,748
Okay, so look.

546
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:27,750
You go back to Diane
and I'll go back to your dad.

547
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,352
Wait! Why not the other way around?

548
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:33,315
You know what he likes.
and I know what she likes.

549
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:35,356
They need all the help they can get.

550
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:37,438
But how will we get them together?

551
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:52,490
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

552
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,412
You're too tense. Relax.

553
00:41:54,652 --> 00:41:58,215
I got 1.000 pounds of animal
under my butt, and she says, "Relax."

554
00:41:58,455 --> 00:42:00,577
Move with the horse
and you'll be fine.

555
00:42:00,737 --> 00:42:03,339
When did you become an expert
all of a sudden?

556
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:05,781
Ain't you never seen a Western?

557
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:08,743
Honey, the last Western I saw
was an omelet.

558
00:42:15,268 --> 00:42:18,471
What happened to those
equestrian classes you took?

559
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:21,273
Are you asking me a question?

560
00:42:22,994 --> 00:42:25,156
Come on.
I'll race you to the lake.

561
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:27,518
No, no. Slow is good.

562
00:42:27,718 --> 00:42:29,920
I like to enjoy the scenery.

563
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:35,564
I got spurs that jingle jingle jangle

564
00:42:36,045 --> 00:42:39,608
As I ride merrily along

565
00:42:39,888 --> 00:42:42,290
We're doing a good job, aren't we?

566
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,852
I'm finally getting the hang of this.

567
00:42:47,614 --> 00:42:49,456
I'm getting the hang of this!

568
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,900
Oh, come on, Amanda.
My voice isn't that bad!

569
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:01,425
I been in the desert
On a horse with no name

570
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:03,947
It's good to get out of the rain

571
00:43:04,588 --> 00:43:07,830
Not only is she an excellent rider.
she's a gourmet cook...

572
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,432
...she paints...

573
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,513
...she speaks four languages....

574
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,235
You know, honey.
you could learn a lot from Clarice.

575
00:43:14,396 --> 00:43:15,997
Alyssa, there's a....

576
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,401
Honey!

577
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:35,052
Come here! Come here!

578
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,061
Where is that girl?

579
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:48,022
Did you bring it?

580
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:00,432
Whoa, bud!

581
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:07,238
Someone turn this thing off!

582
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:21,129
Stop this right now!
I'm telling you! Stop!

583
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:29,576
Step on it!

584
00:44:37,502 --> 00:44:38,823
Oh, dear! Oh, my!

585
00:44:50,913 --> 00:44:52,034
Help me!

586
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:53,755
Somebody help me!

587
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:55,957
Hang on!

588
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:03,883
Call 911 !

589
00:45:04,444 --> 00:45:05,244
Slow down.

590
00:45:05,404 --> 00:45:07,166
Don't talk to me!
Talk to the horse!

591
00:45:07,326 --> 00:45:08,967
I was talking to the horse!

592
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:10,488
Okay, it's okay.

593
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,452
I'm on a killer!
They gave me the killer horse!

594
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:15,452
Relax.

595
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,341
You okay?

596
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:29,344
I about dropped
my transmission back there.

597
00:45:29,544 --> 00:45:33,947
If it's any consolation, I used to
look like a real jerk on a horse.

598
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:42,034
How many fingers, cowboy?

599
00:45:43,355 --> 00:45:44,195
Six.

600
00:45:44,516 --> 00:45:46,517
Close enough.
Can you stand?

601
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:53,042
Which is more bruised.
my butt or my ego?

602
00:45:53,323 --> 00:45:54,924
Have someone take a look at that.

603
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:56,605
-My butt?
-No.

604
00:45:56,926 --> 00:45:58,887
That cut. Right there.

605
00:45:59,207 --> 00:46:00,809
Oh, great.

606
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:02,970
We have first aid at the camp.

607
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:05,332
Oh, thanks.
I just live over here.

608
00:46:07,294 --> 00:46:08,455
Are you Roger Callaway?

609
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:10,777
-I think so.
-The Roger Callaway?

610
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:12,778
From the Callaway Foundation?

611
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,179
Yeah, that's me.

612
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,743
I'm Diane Barrows. I always wanted
to meet you. My kids love your camp.

613
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:19,864
You have kids?

614
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,507
They're not mine. I work for
the East Side Children's Center.

615
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:25,228
Of course.

616
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:29,031
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Callaway.

617
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:30,192
Roger, please.

618
00:46:32,994 --> 00:46:34,956
And thank you for saving my life.

619
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:39,360
And you really should put
some iodine on your butt.

620
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,681
Cut.

621
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:42,362
Miss Barrows....

622
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:44,083
b.

623
00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:48,527
I was wondering if
I could offer you iced tea.

624
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:51,769
I'd love to hear more about
the camp and how it's going.

625
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,411
Only if we walk.

626
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:55,573
You took the words out of my mouth.

627
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:57,254
Come on.

628
00:46:58,135 --> 00:46:59,576
Now hold still.

629
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:06,141
You certainly are an angel of mercy.

630
00:47:06,381 --> 00:47:09,183
-I see worse cuts than this every day.
-Thanks.

631
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:11,745
My gang always invents
new ways to get hurt.

632
00:47:11,946 --> 00:47:14,988
-You must really love children.
-What's not to love?

633
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:21,353
-No, really.
-You big baby! Come here.

634
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:24,235
ls that better?

635
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:40,128
I can't hear anything!

636
00:47:40,368 --> 00:47:42,570
We've got to get closer!

637
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:46,613
You know, you're not at all
what I expected.

638
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:47,654
Really?

639
00:47:48,054 --> 00:47:49,456
What were you expecting?

640
00:47:50,216 --> 00:47:51,537
Blue blood, for one thing.

641
00:47:52,818 --> 00:47:56,661
I thought you'd be some rich, big.
old, fat geezer who smokes cigars.

642
00:47:56,862 --> 00:47:57,822
Really?

643
00:47:58,022 --> 00:48:01,105
I made my money the old-fashioned way.
Pure dumb luck.

644
00:48:01,265 --> 00:48:02,066
I doubt that.

645
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:03,467
I swear to God.

646
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:07,230
Twelve years ago, a cell phone
was something out of Star rreh.

647
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,512
But I thought it was pretty cool.
so I bought airspace.

648
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:12,274
Get out!

649
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:15,516
That's like money out of thin air!

650
00:48:15,717 --> 00:48:18,119
You'll notice I don't carry one.
I hate them.

651
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,440
Excuse me.

652
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,401
Miss Kensington, boss.

653
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:23,042
She insists.

654
00:48:23,923 --> 00:48:26,525
Excuse me. It's my--
Miss Kensington.

655
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,088
How you doing?

656
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:32,970
How am I doing?

657
00:48:35,052 --> 00:48:36,693
Please, honey, look.

658
00:48:38,535 --> 00:48:43,139
Do you have any idea
what your daughter has done?

659
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:46,061
-No, what?
-She spit--

660
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:47,822
Gum? In your hair?

661
00:48:49,704 --> 00:48:50,585
Are you sure?

662
00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:54,708
Am I sure?
Oh, my God! You should see it!

663
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:56,910
I'm certain it wasn't intentional.

664
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,792
Look, of course.
You've had a rough day.

665
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,354
Rough is a broken nail, darling.

666
00:49:02,514 --> 00:49:04,916
What I've had is a train wreck!

667
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:07,678
Just try to calm down.
I'll speak to her.

668
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:09,360
I'm just going to go now.

669
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,962
Just one second.
One second, please.

670
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:16,685
What? Is there a woman
there with you?

671
00:49:16,886 --> 00:49:20,248
Yes, there's sort of a woman here.
She's from the camp.

672
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:25,052
How delightful!
I'm in the middle of a crisis...

673
00:49:25,252 --> 00:49:28,014
...and you're having a bachelor party!

674
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:30,136
I'm in a meeting. That's all.

675
00:49:30,336 --> 00:49:32,138
It's just a meeting.

676
00:49:33,779 --> 00:49:37,582
No, we're not going to have dinner.
There's nothing going to go on--

677
00:49:38,063 --> 00:49:41,425
Please. I'll see you
at the end of the week.

678
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:43,867
Me too. Bye-bye.

679
00:49:44,027 --> 00:49:45,308
I'm so sorry.

680
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,716
Sorry about that!

681
00:49:57,718 --> 00:50:01,721
But she squeezed me so hard.
it just sort of popped out.

682
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:04,804
I don't think she likes me much.

683
00:50:04,964 --> 00:50:08,167
She's been looking forward to
meeting you for months.

684
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:10,168
Do you know how much she loves kids?

685
00:50:11,129 --> 00:50:12,930
No. Do you?

686
00:50:14,372 --> 00:50:17,654
Well, you are the first kid
I've ever seen her with.

687
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,175
But I'm sure it's a bunch.

688
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,937
And you love her, right?

689
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,063
Like that ''Can't eat. can't sleep.
reach for the stars...

690
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,945
...over the fence. World Series''
kind of stuff?

691
00:50:32,226 --> 00:50:34,107
ls that what the dictionary says?

692
00:50:34,267 --> 00:50:37,230
You're marrying her
because Alyssa needs. I mean...

693
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,551
...I need a mother?

694
00:50:40,993 --> 00:50:43,315
I think that's
enough questions for today.

695
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:44,316
Wait.

696
00:50:44,556 --> 00:50:46,397
I only got one left.

697
00:50:47,638 --> 00:50:48,719
Let's have it.

698
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,082
Who was that pretty woman
out on the patio?

699
00:50:53,603 --> 00:50:55,364
The Roger Callaway?

700
00:50:56,405 --> 00:50:58,327
On a white horse, no less.

701
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,648
So?

702
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:03,891
He comes riding up, saves my life.

703
00:51:04,091 --> 00:51:06,413
He's probably worth billions.
Totally cute.

704
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:08,895
Oh, my God! He is so cute.

705
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:10,096
To top it all off...

706
00:51:10,296 --> 00:51:12,778
...he's, honest to God, a nice guy.

707
00:51:13,018 --> 00:51:15,300
I'm stupid enough
to think he's available.

708
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,222
-lsn't he?
-No.

709
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:19,023
ls too.

710
00:51:20,064 --> 00:51:21,265
How would you know?

711
00:51:21,465 --> 00:51:22,906
Was he wearing a ring?

712
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:29,271
Even if he was available.
he wouldn't be interested in me.

713
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:30,833
Don't put yourself down.

714
00:51:31,033 --> 00:51:33,235
Guys like him like
girls with food names.

715
00:51:35,597 --> 00:51:37,718
Cookie, Muffin...

716
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:38,959
...Candy.

717
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:40,681
They don't marry girls like me.

718
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:42,162
He did once.

719
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:44,083
ls this published somewhere?

720
00:51:44,283 --> 00:51:47,246
Her name was Cathy.
She wasn't a food, but a teacher.

721
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:50,929
He's even more perfect
than I thought.

722
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:53,371
I'm cheating.
Give me one of those.

723
00:51:54,772 --> 00:51:56,053
Give me that stick.

724
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,257
Vincenzo, do you believe in magic?

725
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:02,258
Like card tricks?

726
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:04,820
No, sparks between two people.

727
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,822
It happens when you least expect it.

728
00:52:06,982 --> 00:52:08,303
Why do you ask?

729
00:52:10,705 --> 00:52:12,466
No reason.

730
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:15,348
It's been so long since Cathy and....

731
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,191
I didn't think it'd happen again.

732
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,995
That Miss Kensington
is really something.

733
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:26,677
Well, actually...

734
00:52:27,038 --> 00:52:29,320
...that's not who I meant.

735
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:31,962
I know.

736
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:39,648
You're my best man. You're supposed
to come up with words of wisdom now.

737
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,211
Why don't you go for a drive?

738
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:45,973
See where you end up.

739
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:58,743
Now, where's he going?

740
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,351
It's the home office.

741
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:11,553
The Butkises want Amanda.
The paperwork just went through.

742
00:53:14,035 --> 00:53:15,997
Who the hell is this?

743
00:53:16,477 --> 00:53:20,240
Diane Barrows, Since when does
your department okay an adoption...

744
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,762
...without the caseworker's report?

745
00:53:23,803 --> 00:53:25,444
I know these people are nice.

746
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:29,488
Have you ever met those people?

747
00:53:29,688 --> 00:53:32,610
These people collect kids.
They'll take anybody.

748
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,946
Where is Diane Barrows?

749
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,947
I think she's in the office.

750
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:57,310
Let me just run this by you
one more time.

751
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,232
Just hear me out one more time.

752
00:54:01,273 --> 00:54:05,797
I know I don't make that much money.
And I know I'm a little bit single.

753
00:54:05,957 --> 00:54:07,358
But I want to adopt Amanda.

754
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:11,641
Are you laughing at me?
He's laughing at me!

755
00:54:13,603 --> 00:54:15,324
You stupid jerk!

756
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,213
What?

757
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:28,215
Oh, it's you.

758
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:31,097
ls this a bad time?

759
00:54:31,537 --> 00:54:32,978
A bad time?

760
00:54:33,259 --> 00:54:34,380
For a meeting?

761
00:54:35,781 --> 00:54:38,263
No. I'm having a problem
with one of my kids.

762
00:54:38,423 --> 00:54:39,584
Anything I can do?

763
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:43,747
You've already saved my life.
What can I do for you?

764
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,150
I want to apologize for yesterday.

765
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:50,192
It was very rude.
I shouldn't have taken that call.

766
00:54:50,352 --> 00:54:51,713
I'd like to make it up.

767
00:54:51,874 --> 00:54:53,715
Okay, then give me your car.

768
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:01,041
Perhaps we could discuss it
at a pizza joint I saw in town.

769
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:03,323
I'm sorry. I can't.

770
00:55:05,244 --> 00:55:08,087
I understand.
Maybe some other time, then.

771
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,689
No, it's not like that.

772
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:15,332
I'm on duty today in the mess hall.
It's my kids' turn to serve.

773
00:55:15,532 --> 00:55:16,653
Oh, I see.

774
00:55:16,854 --> 00:55:19,576
If your heart's set on Italian.
you could join us.

775
00:55:19,936 --> 00:55:21,097
We're having...

776
00:55:21,257 --> 00:55:22,818
...macaroni and cheese.

777
00:55:22,978 --> 00:55:24,099
And peach cobbler?

778
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,181
Oh, yeah, All you can eat.

779
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,550
Darling, Craig can meet
the preident on Sunday.

780
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,432
I need bridesmaids!

781
00:55:40,993 --> 00:55:42,754
You must come.

782
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:45,276
Fabulous!

783
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:48,279
There's my other line.
Love you. Mean it. Ciao.

784
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,521
M.

785
00:55:52,202 --> 00:55:55,885
Why do you keep bothering me
with numbers? It's my wedding.

786
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,487
Whatever it costs, just get it!

787
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:10,176
It's a cozy little spot!

788
00:56:10,336 --> 00:56:12,098
When were you last here?

789
00:56:12,258 --> 00:56:13,259
It must be 10 years!

790
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:14,980
Ten years?

791
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,862
Did you build the camp
and never come back?

792
00:56:17,982 --> 00:56:20,585
No, it was my wife's idea.
She had a big heart.

793
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:21,826
Had?

794
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:24,588
She passed away when Alyssa was born.

795
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,029
Sorry.

796
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:29,712
I just never could come back.
Until now, that is.

797
00:56:45,244 --> 00:56:46,365
Here you go!

798
00:56:46,765 --> 00:56:48,727
Hey, Carmen. Where's Amanda?

799
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:51,329
I don't know.
One minute she's behind me....

800
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:54,532
Would you get her? I want to
introduce her to somebody.

801
00:56:57,054 --> 00:57:01,297
I'm having the hardest time keeping
tabs on her. She keeps running off.

802
00:57:01,457 --> 00:57:04,259
Tell me about it.
I got one just like her at home.

803
00:57:35,164 --> 00:57:36,605
What are you doing?

804
00:57:37,406 --> 00:57:40,088
I'm cleaning this window.
Look at it. It's filthy.

805
00:57:40,288 --> 00:57:42,250
Diane wants to see you. Come on.

806
00:57:45,252 --> 00:57:46,453
Hey, my hat!

807
00:57:50,016 --> 00:57:51,577
Do something, Alyssa!

808
00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:54,099
Here she comes.

809
00:58:00,104 --> 00:58:02,266
My compliments to the chef.

810
00:58:03,467 --> 00:58:05,468
Amanda, take that thing off.

811
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,832
Let her keep it on.
It might be the latest thing.

812
00:58:49,424 --> 00:58:51,305
Excuse me, ma'am.

813
00:58:52,826 --> 00:58:53,867
Did you just snort?

814
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:01,073
I suppose you think this is funny?

815
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:06,357
Well, maybe you'll get
a little chuckle out of this.

816
00:59:06,517 --> 00:59:08,319
You wouldn't dare!

817
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,882
Food fight!

818
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:30,216
That was great!

819
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:32,778
I couldn't have done it better myself.

820
00:59:32,938 --> 00:59:35,060
I almost had a heart attack.

821
00:59:53,355 --> 00:59:56,357
I guess that's what they mean
by ''eat and run.''

822
00:59:56,557 --> 00:59:58,399
We need doggie bags.

823
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,242
Oh, dear. Look at me.
I am covered in cobbler.

824
01:00:02,402 --> 01:00:03,723
You look good in peach.

825
01:00:03,843 --> 01:00:05,965
Leave it. I may still be hungry.

826
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:11,169
I can't believe you hit me
with the butter.

827
01:00:11,729 --> 01:00:15,693
I didn't start it. You just talk
to that short-order cook of yours.

828
01:00:15,853 --> 01:00:17,614
Oh yeah. Where is she, anyway?

829
01:00:17,774 --> 01:00:19,856
Look at your head.

830
01:00:20,296 --> 01:00:23,579
If you want to get cleaned up.
there's showers over there.

831
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,142
I've got a better idea.
Will you excuse me?

832
01:00:27,342 --> 01:00:29,944
And maybe hold some of that?
Pardon me.

833
01:00:39,672 --> 01:00:40,953
What's wrong with him?

834
01:00:41,113 --> 01:00:44,796
Beats me.
I've never seen him act like this.

835
01:00:56,205 --> 01:00:58,327
I think he's gone mental.

836
01:00:58,527 --> 01:01:00,849
He's got a lot on his mind.

837
01:01:04,852 --> 01:01:07,254
Don't you know
not to swim after you eat?

838
01:01:07,534 --> 01:01:08,855
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

839
01:01:08,975 --> 01:01:10,577
I got a cramp!

840
01:01:10,737 --> 01:01:12,298
I can't swim!

841
01:01:18,783 --> 01:01:20,625
No fair. I saved you.

842
01:01:21,585 --> 01:01:22,986
It's too cold.

843
01:01:23,227 --> 01:01:24,948
I'm not going in there.

844
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:32,474
Come on!
I don't want to save you right now.

845
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:37,958
All right, buster.
You better be worth it.

846
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,246
You're not funny.

847
01:01:50,088 --> 01:01:51,529
Oh, my God!

848
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:54,532
Say...

849
01:01:55,452 --> 01:01:57,134
...a guy could drown waiting for you.

850
01:01:57,294 --> 01:01:59,296
Callaway, I'm going to kill you!

851
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:00,777
Bonzai!

852
01:02:03,819 --> 01:02:06,701
Roger, I am going to kill you!

853
01:02:07,862 --> 01:02:08,863
It's working.

854
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:10,464
Look at them.

855
01:02:12,826 --> 01:02:14,988
Now that's more like it.

856
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:19,792
Roger, darling? Anyone home?

857
01:02:22,154 --> 01:02:26,197
Miss Kensington! What a surprise.
We weren't expecting you.

858
01:02:26,397 --> 01:02:28,399
Yes, I know. Where's Roger?

859
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:32,082
Mr. Callaway is out for the afternoon.

860
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:34,724
I see.

861
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:38,127
Would you please tell him
I wish to speak with him?

862
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,167
Yes, ma'am.

863
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:40,769
Thank you so much.

864
01:02:45,893 --> 01:02:47,134
I'd like a Diet Coke.

865
01:02:47,534 --> 01:02:49,896
One Diet Coke, coming up.

866
01:02:52,698 --> 01:02:54,139
With lime.

867
01:03:04,388 --> 01:03:07,550
Awfully early in the day
to be looking at stars.

868
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:20,601
What do we have here?

869
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:31,569
You can't always be this much fun.
It wouldn't be fair.

870
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:32,570
Trust me.

871
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,012
I haven't done this in years.

872
01:03:35,132 --> 01:03:36,493
Well, it feels good.

873
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,175
It feels better every second.

874
01:03:40,577 --> 01:03:41,898
-Don't move.
-Why?

875
01:03:42,178 --> 01:03:43,299
There's a thing.

876
01:03:43,459 --> 01:03:45,300
What do you mean ''a thing''?

877
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:47,582
A bug?

878
01:03:48,463 --> 01:03:51,025
A dreaded maraschino bug.

879
01:03:51,185 --> 01:03:52,906
It's highly poisonous.

880
01:03:53,587 --> 01:03:55,749
And you wanted to go for pizza.

881
01:04:01,033 --> 01:04:02,914
I almost didn't come over at all.

882
01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:05,116
I'm glad you did.

883
01:04:18,527 --> 01:04:20,168
What was that?

884
01:04:21,729 --> 01:04:24,412
-It's a sign.
-What do you mean ''a sign''?

885
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:26,533
I don't know.

886
01:04:27,774 --> 01:04:29,616
I think I know what you mean.

887
01:04:30,296 --> 01:04:32,298
It's your Miss Kensington, right?

888
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,621
I'm getting married next month.

889
01:04:37,342 --> 01:04:39,464
Well, of course you are!

890
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:54,115
So what was this?
Just sort of a last fling?

891
01:04:54,316 --> 01:04:56,437
I didn't know.
I was hoping to find out.

892
01:04:56,637 --> 01:04:59,119
Don't worry about it.
I can help you out.

893
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,161
It was nice to meet you.

894
01:05:01,441 --> 01:05:03,363
And thanks for the camp.

895
01:05:03,803 --> 01:05:05,965
Oh, by the way, congratulations!

896
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:07,886
Diane, please.

897
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:10,569
You know what?

898
01:05:10,769 --> 01:05:12,210
This just kills me.

899
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:15,492
We might've hit this one
out of the park.

900
01:05:15,653 --> 01:05:17,654
It was there, I know it.

901
01:05:17,854 --> 01:05:19,856
That "can't eat. can't sleep...

902
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,058
...reach for the stars.
over the fence...

903
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,179
...World Series" kind of thing.

904
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:27,662
Oh, well.

905
01:05:34,107 --> 01:05:36,429
I've got to get a dictionary.

906
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:40,312
They were so close!

907
01:05:40,793 --> 01:05:43,955
Grownups, they think too much.

908
01:05:44,796 --> 01:05:46,397
I give up.

909
01:05:46,557 --> 01:05:48,079
No, we mustn't!

910
01:05:48,279 --> 01:05:50,000
And why mustn't we?

911
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,083
Because third time's a charm. Right?

912
01:05:53,643 --> 01:05:55,004
Right.

913
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:00,609
Boss!

914
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:02,170
It's Miss Kensington.

915
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:04,372
Thanks. I'll take it down here.

916
01:06:05,492 --> 01:06:06,453
Not here.

917
01:06:06,693 --> 01:06:08,135
Up there.

918
01:06:10,617 --> 01:06:11,978
Up there?

919
01:06:12,178 --> 01:06:13,539
Afraid so.

920
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:19,223
Roger, darling!

921
01:06:19,384 --> 01:06:22,666
Clarice! Your hair.
You're here!

922
01:06:24,107 --> 01:06:26,229
What did you do?
Fall in the lake?

923
01:06:26,469 --> 01:06:29,832
It's the funniest thing--
Shouldn't you be in New York?

924
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:32,394
I couldn't bear to be away
a moment longer.

925
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:33,995
You were just gone a day.

926
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:38,039
I know! And I was positively
miserable the entire time.

927
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:40,801
So I've decided we mustn't
wait another day.

928
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:41,802
To what?

929
01:06:41,962 --> 01:06:45,685
To be married, silly.
Next month seems like an eternity.

930
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:48,367
When two people are
as much in love as we...

931
01:06:48,607 --> 01:06:51,129
...I say.
''What's wrong with tomorrow''?

932
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:52,970
Tomorrow?

933
01:06:53,771 --> 01:06:56,573
Darling, you haven't said
a word about my hair.

934
01:07:00,737 --> 01:07:02,058
Okay, listen to this.

935
01:07:02,658 --> 01:07:05,420
"Dear Roger.
You are so totally fresh.

936
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,022
Just thinking about you
drives me mental.

937
01:07:08,423 --> 01:07:10,945
Meet me where we met
with the horses.

938
01:07:11,145 --> 01:07:13,387
Seven dclock tonight.
Love, Diane."

939
01:07:13,587 --> 01:07:14,828
How's that?

940
01:07:15,188 --> 01:07:16,509
Very romantic.

941
01:07:16,669 --> 01:07:18,111
Want to hear mine?

942
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:19,752
''Dear Diane....

943
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:26,157
Dear Diane, ever since
I saw you riding the horse...

944
01:07:26,317 --> 01:07:27,758
...I can't stop thinking about it.

945
01:07:27,998 --> 01:07:30,681
And I know we were disturbed
at the lake...

946
01:07:30,801 --> 01:07:34,644
...but I must see you again
where I saved your life, at 7:30.

947
01:07:35,925 --> 01:07:38,527
Yours truly, Roger Callaway."

948
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:53,739
There you are, my little
gum-chewing assailant.

949
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,260
You're back!

950
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,502
What? No big hug ''hello''?

951
01:07:57,702 --> 01:08:01,705
-You're not supposed to be here.
-ln a perfect world, neither are you.

952
01:08:02,026 --> 01:08:03,747
We're leaving for the city.

953
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:06,149
Right now? It's too soon!

954
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:09,752
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

955
01:08:10,192 --> 01:08:12,954
We're leaving tonight.

956
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,436
This little act of yours
is getting old.

957
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:16,798
What act?

958
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:18,999
Oh, please.

959
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,562
When I was your age.
I'd been through three stepmothers.

960
01:08:22,762 --> 01:08:26,966
I know all the lengths girls go through
to keep Daddy all to themselves.

961
01:08:27,126 --> 01:08:29,728
You got that all wrong, lady.

962
01:08:29,928 --> 01:08:32,050
Alyssa, don't be rude.
I'm talking.

963
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:33,771
Where was l?

964
01:08:34,372 --> 01:08:35,492
Oh, yes.

965
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:39,616
You had Roger to yourself
for nine wonderful years.

966
01:08:39,856 --> 01:08:42,418
But after tomorrow.
I'm the woman of the house.

967
01:08:42,698 --> 01:08:46,101
And you're off to a year-round
boarding school.

968
01:08:46,261 --> 01:08:47,422
Possibly in Tibet.

969
01:08:48,943 --> 01:08:50,665
Did you say tomorrow?

970
01:08:54,428 --> 01:08:56,109
Should I have come here?

971
01:08:58,111 --> 01:08:59,472
Yes, stupid.

972
01:08:59,672 --> 01:09:04,195
He's only worth about $20 billion.
for God's sakes!

973
01:09:04,396 --> 01:09:07,398
Great! Now I'm just after him
for his money.

974
01:09:07,598 --> 01:09:09,199
How shallow is that?

975
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,082
I liked him before
I knew he was rich.

976
01:09:14,243 --> 01:09:15,805
So I should've come here.

977
01:09:16,245 --> 01:09:18,207
He's a little bit engaged.

978
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:24,772
I've never met her.
so maybe that doesn't count.

979
01:09:30,376 --> 01:09:32,298
Come on, ladies. Perk up.

980
01:09:39,544 --> 01:09:40,705
Come on, Amanda!

981
01:09:40,905 --> 01:09:43,067
We're missing the fireworks!

982
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,831
This is Miss Van Dyke
from Children's Services.

983
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:50,152
Hello there.

984
01:09:50,432 --> 01:09:53,795
I believe I have
some very good news for you.

985
01:09:54,396 --> 01:09:57,438
Come to Mama, sweetheart!

986
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:05,685
I feel pretty ding-dang-dong stupid.

987
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:08,767
But my name's Amanda!

988
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:10,328
Alyssa, stop it.

989
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:12,970
Come on, honey.

990
01:10:13,331 --> 01:10:16,854
Do we have to listen to this
the whole way?

991
01:10:20,577 --> 01:10:23,299
Oh, great.
Now I'm going to be road kill.

992
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:32,786
Wait a minute!
What are you doing?

993
01:10:33,787 --> 01:10:35,108
hl

994
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:39,592
You were supposed to protect her!

995
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:41,994
You could've slit their tires!
Anything!

996
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:43,355
They had paperwork.

997
01:10:43,555 --> 01:10:44,396
What paperwork?

998
01:10:44,556 --> 01:10:46,517
We couldn't find you.

999
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:48,839
Did you want us to
lie in front of the van?

1000
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,681
I would have.

1001
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:54,404
I'm taking the Jeep.

1002
01:10:54,604 --> 01:10:55,725
That's the camms.

1003
01:10:55,925 --> 01:10:58,047
Oh, don't you keep me here!

1004
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:02,650
Lots of tie-ups.
It's 20 minutes for the Lincoln.

1005
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:06,173
Ten for the Holland.
The BQE is backed up for two miles.

1006
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:09,175
If you're taking the Van Wyck.
allow an extra 15.

1007
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:11,137
Just stay out of midtown.

1008
01:11:11,297 --> 01:11:14,460
It'll be wall-to-wall limos.
as Clarice Kensington...

1009
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:16,982
...finally lands her man.

1010
01:11:18,223 --> 01:11:21,385
Now, these nincompoops are
your new brothers and sisters.

1011
01:11:21,585 --> 01:11:22,946
From the left, you got...

1012
01:11:23,187 --> 01:11:24,908
...Bubba, Bridget, Brenda...

1013
01:11:25,108 --> 01:11:28,311
...Bonnie, Billy, Bobby, Ben...

1014
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:30,112
...and little Harry. Jr.

1015
01:11:30,392 --> 01:11:31,954
Now, he's ours.

1016
01:11:32,634 --> 01:11:34,636
There's been a big mistake.

1017
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:37,438
You see, my name is not Amanda.

1018
01:11:37,998 --> 01:11:39,520
We know that, honey.

1019
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,601
You do?

1020
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:44,444
Sure. And you will never
have to be Amanda again.

1021
01:11:44,644 --> 01:11:47,646
That's right. Because from now on.
you're going to be...

1022
01:11:47,766 --> 01:11:50,929
...Little Betty Butkis.

1023
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:53,291
Give Betty some Coco Puffs.

1024
01:11:54,612 --> 01:11:56,053
And after breakfast...

1025
01:11:56,253 --> 01:11:59,336
...we're going to go down
and see where your daddy works.

1026
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,657
lsn't that going to be fun?

1027
01:12:06,701 --> 01:12:08,022
Callaway residence.

1028
01:12:08,183 --> 01:12:09,304
One moment, please.

1029
01:12:09,504 --> 01:12:11,425
Miss Callaway, it's for you.

1030
01:12:13,187 --> 01:12:15,028
Hello, this is Miss Callaway.

1031
01:12:15,188 --> 01:12:18,551
I can't talk long. It's me.

1032
01:12:19,952 --> 01:12:21,713
Or should I say...

1033
01:12:23,955 --> 01:12:25,276
...Betty Butkis.

1034
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:27,438
Oh, no! I'm adopted?

1035
01:12:31,361 --> 01:12:33,403
Are those guys scary or what?

1036
01:12:33,803 --> 01:12:35,044
What happened yesterday?

1037
01:12:35,244 --> 01:12:36,405
Are you sitting down?

1038
01:12:36,605 --> 01:12:37,966
Yeah, kind of.

1039
01:12:38,527 --> 01:12:39,888
Clarice moved up the wedding.

1040
01:12:40,128 --> 01:12:41,449
Your dad's getting married...

1041
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:44,171
...in two hours and 1 2 minutes.

1042
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:46,773
-What do we do now?
-I don't know.

1043
01:12:46,974 --> 01:12:48,975
But it'll have to be something major.

1044
01:12:49,255 --> 01:12:50,216
And quick.

1045
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:52,658
You've got to get me out of here.

1046
01:12:52,858 --> 01:12:55,300
These people aren't
just scary, they're--

1047
01:13:04,107 --> 01:13:08,471
New kids aren't allowed to use
the phone. Butkis rules.

1048
01:13:13,115 --> 01:13:16,958
Hey, Vin. You've been taking care
of Alyssa all her life, right?

1049
01:13:17,118 --> 01:13:19,079
Oh, no, Alyssa. Not again.

1050
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,360
Answer the question.

1051
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,163
Yes. From the day she was--
From the day you were born.

1052
01:13:24,324 --> 01:13:27,486
So you know pretty well
everything about her?

1053
01:13:28,006 --> 01:13:29,688
Every freckle, every bruise...

1054
01:13:29,888 --> 01:13:31,409
...every scar?

1055
01:13:31,649 --> 01:13:32,610
You could say that.

1056
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:35,693
Bet you don't remember this one.
do you?

1057
01:13:36,373 --> 01:13:38,135
No, that one escapes me.

1058
01:13:38,295 --> 01:13:40,096
Broken bottle sliding into home.

1059
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,739
This one?

1060
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:47,302
Rusty nail right through my shoe.

1061
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:48,903
Bled for six blocks.

1062
01:13:49,984 --> 01:13:50,905
How about here?

1063
01:13:51,225 --> 01:13:53,227
Ever seen this?

1064
01:13:53,427 --> 01:13:54,428
When was that?

1065
01:13:54,548 --> 01:13:57,910
Roman candle last Fourth of July.
Right in the head.

1066
01:13:58,391 --> 01:14:00,152
My God!

1067
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:01,874
You're not Alyssa!

1068
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:03,675
Nope. Name's Amanda.

1069
01:14:03,915 --> 01:14:04,756
Put her there.

1070
01:14:05,036 --> 01:14:07,638
Identical strangers?

1071
01:14:07,838 --> 01:14:09,960
Holy mackerel, it's amazing!

1072
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,962
Yeah. And it's weird too.

1073
01:14:12,242 --> 01:14:15,645
But if you're here with us.
then Alyssa is....

1074
01:14:15,845 --> 01:14:17,086
ln a lot of trouble.

1075
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,648
-I got to tell Mr. Callaway.
-Oh, no.

1076
01:14:19,848 --> 01:14:21,489
Wait! You can't tell him yet.

1077
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,812
We got to get him to see
Diane before the wedding.

1078
01:14:25,012 --> 01:14:28,335
They'll fall in love.
and Clarice will be history.

1079
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:32,418
Where the hell is everybody?

1080
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:37,902
I sure hope you got a plan.

1081
01:15:09,127 --> 01:15:10,488
What are you doing here?

1082
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:13,451
I came for Mr. Callaway's
daughter. Alyssa.

1083
01:15:14,732 --> 01:15:15,853
You got her.

1084
01:15:16,093 --> 01:15:17,454
I want her back.

1085
01:15:18,175 --> 01:15:19,536
What are you talking about?

1086
01:15:19,736 --> 01:15:22,538
I don't have her.
I don't even know her.

1087
01:15:23,059 --> 01:15:24,500
Yes, you do.

1088
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:28,063
This is Alyssa Callaway.

1089
01:15:28,263 --> 01:15:31,385
No, you'd better get
your eyes checked because...

1090
01:15:31,545 --> 01:15:33,747
...this is a little girl
named Amanda.

1091
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:37,110
This is your Amanda.

1092
01:15:45,436 --> 01:15:47,278
Oh, my God!

1093
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:50,160
Look, they're identical.

1094
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:53,723
This is amazing.

1095
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:55,765
Yeah. And it's weird too.

1096
01:15:57,006 --> 01:15:57,846
I understand...

1097
01:15:58,087 --> 01:16:01,169
...that through some simple mix-up...

1098
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:04,652
...that Alyssa is in the care
of Child Services.

1099
01:16:05,132 --> 01:16:07,014
I've been authorized to tell you...

1100
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:10,937
...that if I get her back.
there'll be no legal entanglements.

1101
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,982
She's not exactly with me here.

1102
01:16:19,424 --> 01:16:21,065
She's been....

1103
01:16:22,106 --> 01:16:23,507
Well, she was adopted.

1104
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:26,109
Then you better un-adopt her quick.

1105
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:29,352
Mr. Callaway's getting married
in 90 minutes.

1106
01:16:29,592 --> 01:16:31,553
He's expecting
his real daughter there.

1107
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:33,595
Ninety minutes?

1108
01:16:34,155 --> 01:16:36,557
I can't get to Staten Island
and back in 90 minutes.

1109
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:40,561
Well, could I suggest that
you go really, really fast?

1110
01:16:42,482 --> 01:16:43,243
Here.

1111
01:16:43,523 --> 01:16:45,565
If you get into any trouble...

1112
01:16:45,765 --> 01:16:47,126
...call this number.

1113
01:16:48,087 --> 01:16:49,888
Ask for Lou.

1114
01:16:53,491 --> 01:16:54,972
Lou who?

1115
01:17:06,782 --> 01:17:09,183
Well, hey.
Look at this mess.

1116
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:10,585
Clean it up.

1117
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:12,626
You clean it.

1118
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:15,989
Put a cork in it, okay?
He's management.

1119
01:17:18,711 --> 01:17:21,313
My father's Roger Callaway...

1120
01:17:22,074 --> 01:17:25,116
...and when he finds out
what you're doing here...

1121
01:17:25,276 --> 01:17:28,919
...he's going to buy this whole town
and kick you out of it.

1122
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,043
Roger Callaway? Then how come
you ain't at his wedding?

1123
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:42,330
Come on, Diane. You can do it.

1124
01:17:43,051 --> 01:17:44,852
We might have to stall a bit.

1125
01:17:45,893 --> 01:17:47,054
How?

1126
01:17:47,774 --> 01:17:48,975
How should I know?

1127
01:17:49,215 --> 01:17:51,097
You're the brains of this operation.

1128
01:17:51,858 --> 01:17:54,980
I must be crazy.
But I am not going in that church.

1129
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:59,223
No matter what happens.
I am not going in that church.

1130
01:18:08,551 --> 01:18:10,553
It's only natural to be nervous.

1131
01:18:12,114 --> 01:18:15,396
-I was thinking about the World Series.
-Baseball?

1132
01:18:17,478 --> 01:18:19,480
Did you ever hit a home run?

1133
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,921
Not recently.

1134
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:24,003
You know when it's
bottom of the ninth...

1135
01:18:24,203 --> 01:18:26,085
...the bases are loaded...

1136
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:29,408
...and you know the next one's
coming right down the middle?

1137
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:31,810
And then...

1138
01:18:33,211 --> 01:18:35,172
...you just connect.

1139
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:38,014
And for an instant...

1140
01:18:38,535 --> 01:18:42,898
...you know that it's going
over the fence and out of the park...

1141
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:46,061
...further than
you could ever imagine.

1142
01:18:46,181 --> 01:18:47,942
Yeah, that's a great feeling.

1143
01:18:59,952 --> 01:19:01,713
Clarice hates baseball.

1144
01:19:07,598 --> 01:19:10,480
Come on, Sea Biscuit.
Don't fail me now.

1145
01:19:24,412 --> 01:19:26,733
Hello! Hello!

1146
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:28,655
You looking for a Butkis?

1147
01:19:29,536 --> 01:19:31,177
You looking for a Butkis?

1148
01:19:31,737 --> 01:19:34,420
Yes, I am.
Do you know where he is?

1149
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,822
At the salvage yard, where else?

1150
01:19:37,262 --> 01:19:39,424
Harry works those kids to the bone.

1151
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:40,464
What?

1152
01:19:41,025 --> 01:19:42,786
Why do you think he's got so many?

1153
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,355
Can I use your phone?

1154
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:55,476
Yeah, sure. No charge.

1155
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:10,649
We've been looking for you...

1156
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:12,450
...Your Highness.

1157
01:20:13,091 --> 01:20:14,852
Leave me alone!

1158
01:20:15,092 --> 01:20:16,533
But Your Majesty...

1159
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:18,375
...we brought you something.

1160
01:20:18,535 --> 01:20:20,617
Yeah, something to make you feel...

1161
01:20:20,777 --> 01:20:22,218
...more at home.

1162
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:27,462
I knew somebody in this church
would have a Prozac.

1163
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:29,904
What is taking so long?

1164
01:20:30,144 --> 01:20:31,946
Relax. Enjoy the moment.

1165
01:20:32,106 --> 01:20:34,868
This is the happiest day
of your life.

1166
01:20:35,629 --> 01:20:36,790
I'm happy.

1167
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:38,711
Don't I look happy?

1168
01:20:38,951 --> 01:20:42,714
This is me happy! See?

1169
01:20:42,874 --> 01:20:45,597
Happy, happy, happy!

1170
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:47,998
Let's get the show on the road!

1171
01:20:48,559 --> 01:20:50,561
Here's your royal throne...

1172
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,882
...Alyssa Callaway.

1173
01:20:53,043 --> 01:20:56,245
Hail, Betty.
Oueen of the scrap heap.

1174
01:20:56,445 --> 01:20:58,287
Hail, Betty!

1175
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:00,969
My name's Alyssa Callaway!

1176
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:03,731
Yeah, right. And I'm Princess Di.

1177
01:21:08,815 --> 01:21:11,617
Attention, Harry Butkis.

1178
01:21:11,778 --> 01:21:13,939
We're here to pick up
Alyssa Callaway.

1179
01:21:14,099 --> 01:21:16,982
All you kids in the yard.
Stand clear.

1180
01:21:17,142 --> 01:21:18,983
We're coming in.

1181
01:21:43,603 --> 01:21:44,404
Told you!

1182
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:53,531
Alyssa Callaway?

1183
01:21:53,651 --> 01:21:55,813
I've got to get you to that church.

1184
01:21:56,733 --> 01:21:57,934
That is my kid!

1185
01:21:58,095 --> 01:21:59,736
Out of my way, piece of junk!

1186
01:21:59,896 --> 01:22:02,058
I would love to kill you...

1187
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:05,500
...before I turn you over
to Social Services.

1188
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:31,361
Alyssa, go ahead. Hurry!

1189
01:22:33,523 --> 01:22:35,324
Oh, God!

1190
01:22:35,725 --> 01:22:37,246
Hi. How you doing?

1191
01:22:37,526 --> 01:22:38,527
Good to see you.

1192
01:22:40,649 --> 01:22:44,051
Hi, Granny. Nice hat.
Thanks for coming.

1193
01:22:44,211 --> 01:22:46,013
Get moving!

1194
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:06,389
Any slower and she'd be
walking backwards.

1195
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:10,352
She's just not herself today.

1196
01:23:12,914 --> 01:23:15,917
We'll never make it.
We only have 10 minutes.

1197
01:23:16,077 --> 01:23:19,480
So Lou, how close can you land
this thing to the church?

1198
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,281
Central Park close enough?

1199
01:23:21,481 --> 01:23:24,003
Central Park? The Central Park?

1200
01:23:24,284 --> 01:23:25,605
That'll do.

1201
01:24:04,035 --> 01:24:07,838
Who would've thought my first girl
would be the last to get married?

1202
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:10,480
Shut up!

1203
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:13,043
Enough of this.

1204
01:24:31,377 --> 01:24:33,139
I'm here. Let's do it.

1205
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,822
We are gathered here
in the sight of God...

1206
01:24:36,982 --> 01:24:38,823
...to join in holy matrimony...

1207
01:24:39,183 --> 01:24:41,185
...Clarice and Roger.

1208
01:24:44,187 --> 01:24:47,550
I'm not going in the church.
I'm not going in the church.

1209
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:54,155
Oh, no.

1210
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:56,477
Not another horse.

1211
01:24:57,318 --> 01:24:58,319
Come on!

1212
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,440
Fine!

1213
01:25:01,161 --> 01:25:02,722
Where is the driver?

1214
01:25:05,204 --> 01:25:06,405
Hey, buddy!

1215
01:25:06,806 --> 01:25:09,448
Take us to St. Bart's.
It's an emergency.

1216
01:25:09,808 --> 01:25:12,730
Yeah? So's this.
I'm on my break!

1217
01:25:18,255 --> 01:25:20,176
Thank you for all your help, bud.

1218
01:25:26,181 --> 01:25:28,063
That's my horse!

1219
01:25:31,906 --> 01:25:33,587
Faster, horsey, faster!

1220
01:25:34,988 --> 01:25:37,510
To have and to hold.
for richer or poorer...

1221
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:40,072
...in sickness and health.
as long as you live?

1222
01:25:40,272 --> 01:25:42,394
I do. I really do. Now him.

1223
01:25:46,037 --> 01:25:48,679
Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!

1224
01:25:55,444 --> 01:25:58,047
-Hang on!
-I'm hanging on!

1225
01:25:58,967 --> 01:26:00,408
What street's it on again?

1226
01:26:00,809 --> 01:26:02,850
54th and Park.

1227
01:26:03,051 --> 01:26:04,011
Are we there yet?

1228
01:26:04,171 --> 01:26:05,012
Almost!

1229
01:26:05,212 --> 01:26:06,333
Signal!

1230
01:26:08,575 --> 01:26:10,416
And do you, Roger...

1231
01:26:10,577 --> 01:26:12,538
...take this woman, Clarice...

1232
01:26:12,698 --> 01:26:14,820
...to be your lawful wedded wife?

1233
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,461
To have and to hold...

1234
01:26:16,661 --> 01:26:17,942
...for richer, for poorer...

1235
01:26:18,623 --> 01:26:21,465
...and in sickness and in health...

1236
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:24,187
...as long as you both shall live?

1237
01:26:43,563 --> 01:26:45,685
Oh, God! We made it.

1238
01:26:49,848 --> 01:26:51,129
Aren't you coming?

1239
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:55,332
No, I think I'll just wait
for Amanda out here.

1240
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,454
Diane Barrows!

1241
01:26:57,614 --> 01:27:00,016
Get your butt up here...

1242
01:27:00,617 --> 01:27:02,178
...this instant!

1243
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:05,941
I'll stand in the back...

1244
01:27:06,141 --> 01:27:08,063
...and take a little look-see.

1245
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:09,824
I....

1246
01:27:59,304 --> 01:28:00,184
I can't.

1247
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:09,071
Excuse me? What did you say?

1248
01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:10,953
I'm so sorry. I can't.

1249
01:28:16,077 --> 01:28:18,079
I should've said something earlier.

1250
01:28:26,365 --> 01:28:27,846
I'm in love with someone else.

1251
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,497
I guess I deserve that.

1252
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:47,382
This is all your fault!

1253
01:28:50,424 --> 01:28:51,545
Lady...

1254
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:53,187
...if you touch that child...

1255
01:28:53,387 --> 01:28:56,870
...I'll pop you one, so help me God.

1256
01:29:12,482 --> 01:29:13,843
Oh, my God!

1257
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,404
There's two of them!

1258
01:29:15,685 --> 01:29:17,526
It's a conspiracy!

1259
01:29:18,007 --> 01:29:20,529
Well, at least I'll get to
hit one of you.

1260
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:24,372
Back off, Barbie!

1261
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:27,494
And by the way...

1262
01:29:27,774 --> 01:29:30,617
...you have a little bit
of something on your teeth.

1263
01:29:33,059 --> 01:29:37,222
I have never been more
humiliated in my life!

1264
01:29:42,466 --> 01:29:43,307
Want to bet?

1265
01:29:52,074 --> 01:29:53,355
Daddy!

1266
01:29:56,637 --> 01:29:57,878
Oh my God!

1267
01:30:03,803 --> 01:30:05,845
About time you showed up.

1268
01:30:06,085 --> 01:30:08,007
We got here soon as we could.

1269
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:09,768
Hi, Daddy.

1270
01:30:18,215 --> 01:30:19,055
Impossible.

1271
01:30:19,696 --> 01:30:22,138
Nothing's impossible.
Right. Alyssa?

1272
01:30:22,618 --> 01:30:24,179
You got that right.

1273
01:30:26,782 --> 01:30:28,023
Wait, if you're...

1274
01:30:28,383 --> 01:30:29,704
...my....

1275
01:30:33,867 --> 01:30:34,708
Who are you?

1276
01:30:35,108 --> 01:30:38,071
Name's Amanda. Put her there.
I'm with her.

1277
01:31:07,214 --> 01:31:08,735
Well, I guess we're even.

1278
01:31:09,576 --> 01:31:10,617
What do you mean?

1279
01:31:12,058 --> 01:31:13,619
You saved my life.

1280
01:31:13,819 --> 01:31:17,102
Sorry, I didn't want
the wrong girl to go down the aisle.

1281
01:31:17,302 --> 01:31:19,664
I mean, the wrong flower girl.

1282
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:21,425
You had it right the first time.

1283
01:31:22,266 --> 01:31:25,428
Told you.
Third time's a charm.

1284
01:31:26,269 --> 01:31:27,550
Wait a minute.

1285
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:29,512
All of this was your doing?

1286
01:31:32,154 --> 01:31:33,115
It was, was it?

1287
01:31:34,115 --> 01:31:37,358
Well, ladies, what do you have
to say for yourselves?

1288
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:41,681
So kiss already!

1289
01:31:58,335 --> 01:31:59,976
-Put her there.
-Sister.

1290
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:08,903
And it's a high flyball...

1291
01:32:09,103 --> 01:32:11,906
...over the left field wall.

1292
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:15,829
Excuse me.

1293
01:32:16,309 --> 01:32:18,431
This gentleman claims...

1294
01:32:18,591 --> 01:32:21,193
...that the ladies stole his buggy.

1295
01:32:22,194 --> 01:32:23,595
He's right. We did!

1296
01:32:23,795 --> 01:32:25,597
You did go out of your way.

1297
01:32:25,757 --> 01:32:27,198
It was her idea.

1298
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:35,284
I'd like you to ask
that nice gentleman if he'd sell.

1299
01:32:35,525 --> 01:32:38,887
I don't care how much. That horse
deserves a house in the country.

1300
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:44,612
I trust we can make
some kind of arrangement.

1301
01:32:46,733 --> 01:32:50,256
Girls, what do you say
we do a little sightseeing?

1302
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:53,499
And then you girls
can tell us the whole story.

1303
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:56,261
Driver, once around the park.
if you please.

1304
01:32:56,461 --> 01:32:58,783
It'll be my pleasure, boss.

1305
01:32:59,864 --> 01:33:01,185
Walk on. Duke!
