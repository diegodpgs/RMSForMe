1
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:19,061
- Lights up !
- Beginners, please !

2
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:21,303
- Your five-minute call, sir.
- Places.

3
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:23,772
- Places. Everyone to their places.

4
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,400
Sh. Quiet, everyone.

5
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:27,834
Opening nights ?
I love opening nights.

6
00:00:29,348 --> 00:00:31,873
- How are you ? Good to see you.
- Good evening, Charles.

7
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:33,444
- Sir Herbert, how are you ?
- This is my wife.

8
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:35,618
- Oh, Lady Herbert.
- How do you do ?

9
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:36,414
May I give you a peck ?

10
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,588
One of Mr Barrie's finest ?

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,191
Oh, that genius Scotsman
has done it again.

12
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:42,594
It's the best thing I've produced
in 25 years.

13
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:45,392
I already have investors interested
back home in New York.

14
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:49,033
See you on Broadway !

15
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:05,659
First positions, people.

16
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:09,596
Standing by, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

17
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:12,151
If you could take
your opening positions, please.

18
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:20,264
Beginners, please take
your opening positions.

19
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:23,685
Audience are coming in. Standing by.

20
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:28,420
- Good audience.
- Sorry ?

21
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:30,320
Good audience tonight.

22
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,630
OK. That's great, thank you.
How much longer ?

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,995
Um, ten minutes, sir.

24
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,640
I love opening nights.

25
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,210
I want to dance with your wife
at the after-party.

26
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:44,172
- Oh, my goodness.
- Good evening, Mr Frohman.

27
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,008
- How are you, John ?
- Very well.

28
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:48,533
It's the best thing
that I've produced in 25 years.

29
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,790
- Hello, George. How are you ?
- Healthy and wealthy, I see.

30
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:52,815
You've rearranged a holiday
for me and I won't forget it.

31
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,294
- For you, Charles, anything.
- You won't regret it.

32
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,319
I'm sure.

33
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:58,414
- Have you got the tickets ?
- They're in my pocket.

34
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:02,333
- There's Mrs Barrie.
- Oh, Mr and Mrs Snow.

35
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:06,942
We were so hoping to speak
with your husband before the show.

36
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:10,605
- Have you seen him ?
- I'm not sure where he is, actually.

37
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,227
We do miss seeing you on stage.
You were so wonderful.

38
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:38,180
Yes, well, it's been some time now.
Are you right to find your seat ?

39
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:40,648
Oh, yes, yes.

40
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:43,653
See you at the party, then.

41
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,212
Excuse me. Could you find Mr Barrie

42
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:48,459
and remind him that they're doing his play
this evening.

43
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,236
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:13,227
Let's close the doors.

45
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:57,070
Really, I mustn't
inconvenience you in this way.

46
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,345
I can wait quite well in the shop.

47
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:03,944
'Tis no inconvenience.
The shop is chilly. And there is a fire here.

48
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:05,320
Really, you are uncommonly good.

49
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:07,914
Sorry, sir.

50
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:11,090
Mrs Barrie wanted me to remind you
that the play's begun.

51
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,696
- Though I imagine you know that.
- They hate it.

52
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:17,598
- Sir ?
- It's like a dentist's office out there. Why ?

53
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:23,811
- I wouldn't say they hate it, sir.
- What do you think ? Do you like it ?

54
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:26,474
- I've just been hired here, sir.
- Yes or no ? I'm not bothered.

55
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:30,821
- I'm not really qualified to...
- Do you like it ? Is it crap ?

56
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:33,255
- Crap, sir ?
- Go on, say it. Just say it.

57
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,928
It's shite, isn't it ? Go on. Say it.

58
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:37,933
- Don't know if I'm...
- "It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie." Go on, say it.

59
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,490
- It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie.
- I knew it.

60
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:43,737
- No, I haven't even seen it.
- I knew it. Thank you.

61
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:45,965
Thank you very much.

62
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,939
Might I knock a tune, milord,
for a moment ?

63
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,288
I'm an old man...

64
00:04:57,826 --> 00:04:59,556
..and I've seen few of the sights.

65
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,393
Absolute rubbish from start to finish.

66
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:21,364
Yes, I found it fearfully dull.

67
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:23,209
Say goodbye to your investment, old boy.

68
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:25,712
Good to see you. My apologies.

69
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,441
We'll get them with the next one,
Charles, I promise.

70
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:30,719
- Of course we will, James.
- I know you put a lot into this one.

71
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:34,747
A fortune, James, but I am fortunate
because I can afford to lose a fortune.

72
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,421
- Can you ?
- No, I can't. How are you ?

73
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:40,032
- Arthur.
- James.

74
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,897
You were sorely missed
at the last club meeting.

75
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:43,092
Was I ?

76
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:47,190
We were beginning to wonder
which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

77
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,960
You wanted to speak with Mr Barrie,
didn't you ?

78
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:52,089
Oh yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them,
should we ?

79
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,125
I don't see why not.

80
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:57,668
If you ask me, the problem
lies in our batting order.

81
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,424
- James.
- Hello, darling.

82
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,222
You remember Mr and Mrs Snow,
don't you ?

83
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,225
- Mrs Snow.
- Mr Barrie.

84
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,447
Mr Snow.

85
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:07,408
The Snows have been waiting
to meet with you all evening.

86
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,735
- Oh, yes.
- Is that right ?

87
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,592
Your play this evening,
it was remarkable, wasn't it ?

88
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:18,291
Was it ?

89
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:24,141
Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.
I'm glad you liked it.

90
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:28,189
How did you feel it went ?

91
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:31,126
- I think I can do better.
- Really ?

92
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,737
- Mary ? Hello ?
- Yes, James ?

93
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:55,550
I'm headed off for the park if you'd
like to join me. It's a beautiful morning.

94
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:58,086
You'll be working, won't you ?

95
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:01,456
Perhaps, yes.

96
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,458
I'll let you to your work then.

97
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:15,307
- Morning, Mr Barrie.
- Morning, Emma.

98
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,039
- Have a good day, sir.
- And you.

99
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:24,983
That's it. Go on, boy. Go get it, boy.

100
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:29,887
That's right. Good boy. Grab it. Good.

101
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:02,898
Who do you belong to ?
Come on, boy. Come on.

102
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,625
Excuse me, sir,
you're standing on my sleeve.

103
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:13,362
Am I ? So sorry.

104
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,704
I might point out
you're lying under my bench.

105
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,104
I have to, I'm afraid.

106
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:23,508
I've been put in a dungeon
by the evil Prince George.

107
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,822
I'm sorry if it bothers you.

108
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:30,021
Well, if you're trapped in the dungeon,
there isn't much to be done now, is there ?

109
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:31,911
Perhaps I could slide a key to you
through the bars.

110
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:37,901
I wouldn't risk it, sir. The evil
Prince George has tortured many men.

111
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,918
I'm sorry. Is he bothering you, sir ?

112
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:44,196
My brother can be
an extremely irritating sort of person.

113
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:46,174
Aha, Prince George, I gather.

114
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:50,868
I understand you are the horrible tyrant
who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch.

115
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:54,786
I'm not horrible really, but a firm ruler, yes.
Kind and tolerant.

116
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:58,360
And what precisely is...
What did you say your name was ?

117
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,302
- Michael.
- What precisely is Michael's crime ?

118
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:04,257
- He's my younger brother.
- Ah.

119
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:09,625
- Fair enough. Sorry, lad. Cannot free you.
- That's all right.

120
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,665
- Do you mind us playing with your dog ?
- No. Go on.

121
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,913
This is Jack, second in line to the throne
and that one's Michael. He's only five.

122
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:19,320
And I'm in prison for it.

123
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:23,750
- I'm so sorry. Are my boys bothering you ?
- We're not bothering him, Mum.

124
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,717
Michael, darling,
come out from under there.

125
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:27,648
I can't. I'm in prison.

126
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,216
Oh, I see.

127
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,572
JM Barrie. Pleased to meet you.

128
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:36,043
JM Barrie, the author ? A pleasure.
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.

129
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:37,878
- Are you a writer ?
- I am.

130
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,235
He's a playwright, Jack.
Quite a famous one, at that.

131
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,555
- I apologize. I imagine you're writing.
- No. Not at all.

132
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:47,065
- Where's Peter ?
- What have you written, Mr Barrie ?

133
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:53,836
Well, currently, I make my living
entertaining princes and their courts

134
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:56,353
with my trained bear, Porthos.

135
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,596
If you command your brother,
Peter, to join us,

136
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,599
I am willing, Prince George,
to give you just such a performance

137
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,918
in exchange for the freedom
of this prisoner, of course.

138
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:06,591
- Very well.
- Very well.

139
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:09,239
Now...

140
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:13,416
I want you to pay particular attention
to the teeth.

141
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:21,058
Some unscrupulous trainers will show you
a bear whose teeth have all been pulled,

142
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:25,700
while other cowards
will force the brute into a muzzle.

143
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:31,972
Only the true master would attempt these
tricks without either measure of safety.

144
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:37,446
- What did you bring me over here for ?
- Peter.

145
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,387
This is absurd. It's just a dog.

146
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,885
Come on, darling.

147
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:49,172
"Just a dog" ? "Just" ?

148
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:51,262
Porthos, don't listen to him.

149
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:53,233
Porthos dreams of being a bear

150
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:58,039
and you want to dash those dreams
by saying he's "just a dog" ?

151
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:00,219
What a horrible, candle-snuffing word.

152
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,498
That's like saying, "He can't climb
that mountain, he's just a man."

153
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:09,199
Or, "That's not a diamond, it's just a rock."

154
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:12,638
"Just."

155
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:19,785
Fine then. Turn him into a bear. If you can.

156
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,821
Peter, where are your manners ?

157
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:26,532
With those eyes, my bonny lad,
I'm afraid you'd never see it.

158
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:32,321
However, with just a wee bit of imagination,

159
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:36,489
I can turn around right now and see...

160
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,558
the great bear, Porthos.

161
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:42,148
Dance with me.

162
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:47,740
Thank you. I don't think I've ever seen
a performance quite like it.

163
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:51,872
We're here every day, and the bear
is always more than happy to perform.

164
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,092
Well, perhaps we'll see you here
tomorrow then.

165
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:56,366
Perhaps.

166
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:59,438
- Peter, jump up please, darling. Quick.
- Bye.

167
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:01,774
Bye.

168
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:05,299
- Peter, didn't you enjoy that ?
- I've seen better.

169
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:08,343
Well, Michael wanted the bear
kept prisoner with him,

170
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,449
and Peter insisted
that Michael was hardly a prisoner

171
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,476
and Porthos simply wasn't a bear at all.

172
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,710
I do very much hope to see them tomorrow.

173
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:22,329
- What's her name ?
- Sylvia. Um...

174
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:26,210
Mrs... something Davies.

175
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:29,543
Llewelyn Davies ?

176
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:33,947
- You know her ?
- I know who she is, of course.

177
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,802
Why, she's a du Maurier,
for heaven's sake.

178
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:42,947
Her father was the artist.
Her brother's the actor.

179
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:48,022
And there was something... tragic
that happened with her husband.

180
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:51,109
Oh, yes. He died.

181
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:54,697
Cancer of the jaw, I believe.

182
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,358
That's horrible.

183
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:02,834
Yes. Apparently, he left her with four boys
and no income to speak of.

184
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:07,112
If it wasn't for her mother's help...

185
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:13,619
James.

186
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:19,059
- We should have them to dinner.
- Should we ?

187
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:23,669
Absolutely. I've always wanted
to meet Madam du Maurier.

188
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:28,004
Why, she knows practically
everyone there is worth knowing.

189
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:44,993
- What are you writing about ?
- Oh.

190
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,633
Nothing of any great consequence.

191
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,434
I can't write.

192
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:54,472
Have you ever kept a journal ?

193
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:58,409
Ever tried your hand at writing a play ?

194
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:01,514
Well, then how do you know ?

195
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:05,794
I know. That's all.

196
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:10,301
I see. Where's your mother today
and the rest of the boys ?

197
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:14,305
Home. Mother's got a bit of a chest cold.

198
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:20,908
I'm sure everyone would be happy
to see you though. One afternoon.

199
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:25,734
I should leave you to your writing.

200
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,473
Peter.

201
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:34,613
I'll see you later then.

202
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:46,859
Why didn't you tell me, Charles ?
You knew it wasn't any good.

203
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:51,278
<i>Why didn't you tell me. James ?
You knew it wasn't any good. Hm ?</i>

204
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:55,956
I took an extended lease on the theater,
keeping the actors on.

205
00:15:56,297 --> 00:16:00,200
- I don't have another play.
- I'm sure you will.

206
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,932
- Won't you ?
- We'll see.

207
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:07,972
I need you to sign for the storage,
Mr Frohman.

208
00:16:08,812 --> 00:16:12,876
- Lower.
- Easy does it. Take your time.

209
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:22,058
It was never meant to be taken seriously.

210
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:25,927
You know what happened, James ?
They changed it.

211
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:30,832
- They changed what ?
- The critics.

212
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:34,973
They made it important.

213
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,288
Hm ?

214
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:43,451
What's it called ?

215
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,991
What's it called ?

216
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:51,303
- "Play."
- "Play."

217
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:05,418
Bang, bang, bang !

218
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:07,536
Bang !

219
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,811
Return the boy to us, you nasty lnjun.

220
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,149
Our people teach boy lndian ways,
make him great warrior.

221
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:19,337
Our chief, Running Nose, never let him go.

222
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:21,585
Bang, bang, bang !

223
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:27,466
Me wounded, Peter. Time's short.

224
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:31,836
You go. Spread wings
and soar like eagle above enemy.

225
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:36,322
Fly back to our chief.
Tell her of my brave defeat.

226
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:39,034
That's crazy. Indians can't fly.

227
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:41,299
Of course they can. Go on, go on, go on.

228
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:43,734
Listen to us, boy.
This lnjun kidnapped you.

229
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:48,425
Not true. We kidnap no one. You lost boy.

230
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:53,050
I teach you ways of the brave.
I take you as my own son.

231
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,839
You are not my father.

232
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,804
Bang, bang, bang, bang !

233
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,609
- I've got him !
- Let me go !

234
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:04,083
- Stop it, you two.
- Ooh, we are awful, aren't we ?

235
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:06,267
- I'm warning you.
- Oh, I'm scared.

236
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:08,134
Of course, you had a bit of fun
for a change.

237
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,985
- Stop it, you two. Get off !
- Don't.

238
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:13,008
- Jack !
- Stop it !

239
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,125
- Get off, George !
- Peter.

240
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:22,540
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it wasn't your fault.

241
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:24,424
I'm afraid it might have been.

242
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:28,532
To be honest, I'm just happy you got him
to join in the game.

243
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:31,127
Oh, yes, I was a tremendous success.

244
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:34,940
Mr Barrie, it's more
than I've been able to achieve.

245
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:38,945
Peter's a different boy since his father died.

246
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,314
You know, I don't think
he's even had a good cry about it.

247
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:46,751
Well, grief affects us all in different ways,
doesn't it ?

248
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,287
Yes, it does.

249
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:54,863
Oh, by the way, my wife would like
to invite you and the boys over to dinner.

250
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,049
Your mother as well.

251
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,976
Oh.

252
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:03,845
How kind. That would be lovely.

253
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:07,629
Well...

254
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,984
Don't you all look lovely in your little suits ?

255
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:16,697
And, Mrs du Maurier, what a shame it is
that we've not met until this evening.

256
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:18,896
How kind of you to say so.

257
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:23,232
Not at all. I can't tell you how many times
I've been to a charity or a social event

258
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:27,044
and seen your name listed
among the organizers.

259
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:34,122
It's the very thing I would love to do myself

260
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:37,554
if I could just find the time.

261
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:41,380
My problem is in finding the time
to do everything else.

262
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:44,578
At the moment I am running
two households.

263
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,819
Sylvia believes she can get by
without a housekeeper.

264
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:48,017
Mother.

265
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:49,990
My house is quite large enough for us all,

266
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:54,227
- but the idea of living with me seems...
- Not now, please, mother.

267
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,604
- We help her keep the house in order.
- Don't interrupt, George.

268
00:19:57,422 --> 00:20:01,223
- Where did you get your manners ?
- Sorry, Grandmother.

269
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,673
Mr Barrie, I understand you've become
playmates of my grandchildren.

270
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:11,755
- Oh, they indulge me, really.
- On the contrary.

271
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:16,922
The other day we took to an exploration
of darkest Africa in our garden.

272
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:22,603
But Mr Barrie was taken ill
by the bite of a... What was it ?

273
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:25,072
Tsetse fly. Quite horrible.

274
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:27,768
Yes, and he swelled to the size
of a hippopotamus.

275
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:29,178
Fingers like sausages.

276
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:32,706
And we had to float in him down the river
like he was a great bloated raft.

277
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:36,587
But the fishing was good, wasn't it ?

278
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:42,197
James.

279
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:47,018
Please.

280
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:49,785
- Bye.
- Thank you so much.

281
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:51,471
- Lovely evening.
- Thank you. Bye.

282
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:55,307
- Good night.
- Good night.

283
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:02,247
Well, that was a disaster.

284
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:07,698
Painful.
Utterly painful to see.

285
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,599
I don't know what you mean.
I had a lovely time.

286
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,052
Oh, James, please.

287
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:17,141
"My problem is in finding
the time to do everything else."

288
00:21:17,313 --> 00:21:21,876
- I never felt so judged in my life.
- Judged ? How do you mean ?

289
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:24,184
A grown man, for heaven's sake,

290
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:27,121
playing all day long with children ?

291
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:32,694
In any case, I hardly think they'll be
the social contact we'd hoped for.

292
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,314
I hadn't really thought of them that way.
I just enjoy their company.

293
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:39,820
He's been a good friend to us, Mother.

294
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:43,586
Yes. But what does that mean ? Hm ?

295
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:44,565
Surely you don't intend...

296
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:50,061
..to keep spending your afternoons
with those children, do you ?

297
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:55,739
And so today, ladies and gentlemen,

298
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:59,767
using only the wind
and his own physical strength,

299
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,379
George Llewelyn Davies shall test
the very limits of the atmosphere

300
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:05,916
using his tethered craft. Go on, boy.

301
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:08,457
- Go on, George.
- You're going to break it, George.

302
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:10,774
- George, stop !
- I just need a bit more speed.

303
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:12,632
I want to do it.

304
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:15,566
Hold off a bit, George.
I think it's in need of a tail.

305
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:17,552
Oh, wait.

306
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:21,273
- Here. James, this will do.
- That's a good idea.

307
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,275
- No, it's not heavy enough.
- I want to do it.

308
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:27,285
- You coming, Peter ?
- Porthos !

309
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:29,516
It'll work this time.

310
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:32,479
Porthos, give us your bell. That's good.

311
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:33,690
- Michael ?
- Yeah ?

312
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:37,158
- Now, would you like to give it a go ?
- Yes, please.

313
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:40,606
- Oh, he can't run fast enough.
- Of course he can.

314
00:22:40,974 --> 00:22:43,501
- Let him try, Jack.
- Now, George, you hold the kite.

315
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,687
George.

316
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:48,466
Come on, boys, let's go back up to the top.
Come on, Peter.

317
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:53,848
Right, George, hold it up. Darling,
you've got to run now. Ready ? Ready ?

318
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:56,845
- Run ! Run, Michael !
- Run !

319
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:57,504
Oh.

320
00:22:57,413 --> 00:23:01,511
- Oh, I told you this wasn't going to work.
- I don't think he's fast enough.

321
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:03,486
It's not going to work
if no one believes in him.

322
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:05,989
- Now, give him a chance.
- Michael, go back to your starting position.

323
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,450
- Come on, darling, try again.
- George, you take the kite.

324
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:14,611
Now this time, I don't want a flea's breath
of doubt. We must get that kite in the air.

325
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:17,889
Right. Look, I think I feel a bit
more breeze. Are you ready, Michael ?

326
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:20,934
- You can do it, Michael.
- You've got to run. Run, Michael, run.

327
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:22,857
- Run !
- That's it !

328
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:27,132
Yes ! He did it !

329
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:30,102
Keep running ! Keep running !

330
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:02,149
What are you writing about now ?

331
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:04,413
Oh, just making notes.

332
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:08,908
I'm never really certain what they're about
until I've read them over later.

333
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:11,790
Something about the kite ?

334
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,910
Now, why do you ask that ?

335
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:20,575
I don't know.

336
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:25,548
If I were a writer I think I could tell
a whole story about flying the kite today.

337
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:31,037
Perhaps you should then. That's
a fantastic idea. Why not give it a try ?

338
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:35,124
I hope you haven't been talking about
anything too serious with this one.

339
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:39,455
No. Talking a bit of silliness really.

340
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,149
Can we have him for supper ?

341
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:52,515
Have him to stay for supper, Michael.
We're not cannibals.

342
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:54,085
You are welcome, you know.

343
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,786
Sylvia. Mr Barrie.

344
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:01,721
Where have you been ?

345
00:25:01,948 --> 00:25:03,711
Flying a kite, Mother,
and having a wonderful time.

346
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,748
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were coming this evening.

347
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,220
No ? Well, apparently you forgot then.

348
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,102
- I brought some supper along for us all.
- You didn't need to do that.

349
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:14,647
Well, there's no food in the house, is there ?

350
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:16,843
Really. You don't need to wait
till the cupboard is bare.

351
00:25:17,102 --> 00:25:18,934
Please, Mother. Come on, darlings.

352
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:21,968
Wipe feet. There's been
enough tracking round here.

353
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:25,506
George, I thought you said you were going
to help your mother take care of the house.

354
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:27,679
Coat, Michael, please. Yes.

355
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:32,350
- And... coat hanger. Good.
- Will we see you tomorrow ?

356
00:25:32,122 --> 00:25:35,490
No. You're going to be helping
round the house tomorrow.

357
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,323
Mother, there is absolutely no need for this.

358
00:25:38,547 --> 00:25:40,948
You can't do everything yourself.

359
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:46,403
Look at you. You're horribly flush.
You're wearing yourself out.

360
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:49,737
Thank you for a lovely day, James.
Excuse me, Mother.

361
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:55,920
So from tomorrow, we're going to have
some discipline around here.

362
00:25:55,687 --> 00:26:00,523
And not one of you will escape.

363
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,315
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Sarah.

364
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:11,501
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Emma.

365
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:21,612
You missed supper.

366
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:26,392
Perhaps I'll have something later.
I have a bit of writing I wanted to do.

367
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:30,530
Are you sure ? It was a lovely meal. Duck.

368
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,551
Sarah let Emma cook this evening.

369
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:39,027
Is that right ? Listen, what would you think
of loaning Emma out to the Davies

370
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:40,720
for the occasional evening ?

371
00:26:40,663 --> 00:26:43,065
They don't actually have a cook.

372
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,404
I take it Mrs Davies enjoyed the meal
that she had here ?

373
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:53,990
I imagine she could use an extra hand
now and again. That's all.

374
00:26:53,898 --> 00:26:56,733
That's very charitable of you.

375
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,916
Perhaps we can send over
some of the silver as well.

376
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:03,452
And what about linen ?

377
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:06,264
I wouldn't be surprised if some of hers
was looking a bit shabby.

378
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:08,634
Please, Mary, stop.

379
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,836
Maybe she can send over
some of the things we've run short on.

380
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:16,509
My husband, for example.

381
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:20,662
We rarely see him in this house.

382
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:23,666
That hasn't seemed to bother you
for some time now.

383
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:14,603
Lords and ladies, His Royal Highness,
King Michael the Benevolent,

384
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:17,186
protector of the realm.

385
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,996
That scepter's made of wood.

386
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:23,160
Yes, well, we dream on a budget here,
don't we ?

387
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:28,770
No, I mean, everyone thinks it's made
of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

388
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,078
The means to an end, Peter.

389
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,023
What we've done is taken
an old hunk of wood

390
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:39,302
and transformed it for all the world to see
into the most magnificent gold.

391
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:44,055
- There you go.
- What's this ?

392
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:49,680
All great writers begin with a good
leather binding and a respectable title.

393
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:52,436
Open it.

394
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,471
"The Boy Castaways."

395
00:28:57,482 --> 00:29:02,011
"Being a record of the terrible adventures
of the brothers Davies,

396
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:07,257
faithfully set forth by...
Peter Llewelyn Davies."

397
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,987
Kipling would swallow his own ear
for a title like that.

398
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,052
Stab him, George. You can do it.

399
00:29:13,537 --> 00:29:16,132
I still have no idea what to write.

400
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:18,985
Write about anything.
Write about your family.

401
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:21,927
- Write about the talking whale.
- What whale ?

402
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:28,081
The one that's trapped in your imagination
and desperate to get out. Come sit down.

403
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,238
I have actually begun writing about the
adventures of the Davies brothers myself.

404
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:38,548
- A play ?
- A play indeed, yes.

405
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:41,279
And I would be extremely honored

406
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:45,729
if you would allow me the use of your name
for one of the characters.

407
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:48,562
I don't know what to say.

408
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,394
Say yes.

409
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:53,330
Good man.

410
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:55,400
Porthos ! That's mine. Let go.

411
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,580
I won't go to bed. I won't, I won't.

412
00:29:58,514 --> 00:30:03,418
You should have been in bed
half an hour ago, young man.

413
00:30:04,072 --> 00:30:06,667
I'm afraid I've grown hopelessly lax
in my discipline.

414
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:10,012
Nonsense. Young boys
should never be sent to bed.

415
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,140
They always wake up a day older.

416
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:17,378
And then, before you know it,
they're grown.

417
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,448
Their father would have been horrified.

418
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:21,621
Of course, he never would have allowed
a dog in the house either.

419
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:24,454
He'd have tied him up in the yard.

420
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:28,426
Right ! Last one in bed's a hairy toad.

421
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:21,501
You mean a lot to my boys, you know.

422
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,795
Especially Peter.

423
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,578
It seems to me
that Peter's trying to grow up too fast.

424
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:38,158
I imagine he thinks that grown-ups don't
hurt as deeply as children do when they...

425
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:40,626
when they lose someone.

426
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:48,450
I lost my elder brother, David,
when I was just Peter's age.

427
00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:51,488
And it nearly destroyed my mother.

428
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,994
James, I'm so sorry.

429
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:59,909
Your poor mother.
I can't imagine losing a child.

430
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:02,036
Aye.

431
00:32:03,015 --> 00:32:05,382
She didn't get out of bed for months.

432
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:08,119
She wouldn't eat.

433
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:11,504
I tried everything to make her happy, but...

434
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:15,179
she only wanted David.

435
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:16,909
So...

436
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,127
one day...

437
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:23,216
I dressed myself in David's clothing

438
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:28,190
and I went to her.

439
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:31,213
You must have frightened her to death.

440
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:37,207
I think it was the first time
she ever actually... looked at me.

441
00:32:41,784 --> 00:32:44,879
And that was the end of the boy James.

442
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:50,276
I used to say to myself
he'd gone to Neverland.

443
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:52,306
Where ?

444
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:55,894
Neverland. It's a wonderful place.

445
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,218
I've not spoken about this before
to anyone.

446
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:11,756
Ever.

447
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:25,631
What's it like... Neverland ?

448
00:33:28,296 --> 00:33:31,233
One day I'll take you there.

449
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,465
Wait a minute, James.
He's a fairy ?

450
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:38,471
Er, no. He's the irrepressible
spirit of youth. Tinker Bell is the fairy.

451
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:41,576
- Tinker Bell is a woman ?
- She's not a woman. She's a fairy.

452
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:44,775
He is a boy who stays young forever.

453
00:33:44,786 --> 00:33:47,118
James, how does anyone
stay young forever ? It doesn't work.

454
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:49,986
He just believes, Charles.
He imagines life the way he wants it to be,

455
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:55,426
and he believes in it long enough and hard
enough that it all appears before him, see ?

456
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,996
James, I'm your friend.
You're coming off a flop.

457
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:02,604
- You have a man who is a fairy.
- No, a boy who has a fairy.

458
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:04,257
And this girl calls herself Tinker.

459
00:34:04,428 --> 00:34:08,456
And you have a pirate ship on stage
surrounded by tons and tons of water.

460
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:10,527
- That's a lot of water.
- It's a lot of water.

461
00:34:10,436 --> 00:34:14,237
- Yes, and that's a lot of money.
- It is, but we can fake the water.

462
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:17,241
Oh, well, if we can fake the water
then I'm sure your play will be a hit.

463
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:20,814
You know what I think I'll do ? I think
I'll imagine life the way I want it to be...

464
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:21,815
Long enough and hard enough ?

465
00:34:21,952 --> 00:34:26,357
Yes, and then the money for the play
will appear magically before me.

466
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,222
- That's right. That's it.
- Yes.

467
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:31,362
How does the clock wind up
inside the crocodile ?

468
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:33,626
- He swallows it.
- Ah, of course he does.

469
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:37,278
Out !

470
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,305
How was he ?

471
00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:43,019
- Well done.
- Good show !

472
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,313
I finally get the courage
to invite the boys to a game

473
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,283
and we have to suffer
this grave humiliation.

474
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,356
It's perfect actually.

475
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:54,439
Spend a good deal of time with them,
don't you ?

476
00:34:54,712 --> 00:34:57,012
Every moment I can spare, in fact.

477
00:34:57,216 --> 00:34:59,344
I'm glad for you.

478
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,248
And Mrs Davies seems to be
having a good time of it as well.

479
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:07,871
You should be aware though, James,
what some people have been saying.

480
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:12,032
Mind you, I wouldn't bring it up
if I thought the rumors would pass.

481
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:15,104
I'm not surprised. What are they saying ?

482
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:18,384
Very well.

483
00:35:18,328 --> 00:35:21,788
That you spend much more time with Mrs
Davies than you do with your own wife.

484
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,529
She's a widow. And...

485
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:28,137
And a friend. That's it. Nothing more.

486
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:34,161
There have also been questions about
how you spend your time with those boys.

487
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,443
And why.

488
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:41,605
That's outrageous. How could anyone
think something so evil ?

489
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:46,304
They're children.
They're innocent children.

490
00:35:47,484 --> 00:35:49,578
You find a glimmer of happiness
in this world,

491
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,038
there's always someone
who wants to destroy it.

492
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:58,447
No. Thank you, Arthur, but I don't think
many will give credence to such nonsense.

493
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:01,108
Then why is no one sitting with them ?

494
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:05,084
Once you get a bit of notoriety, James,

495
00:36:05,474 --> 00:36:11,438
people watch you and they will
look for ways to drag you down.

496
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:17,787
Are you sure your wife doesn't
object to us taking over your cottage

497
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:18,940
for the summer, James ?

498
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,375
- She doesn't go there anymore.
- Really ?

499
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:24,261
It's such a relief to get away.
You'll come and visit, I hope ?

500
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,265
- Of course. Are we in ?
- Everyone in ?

501
00:36:27,504 --> 00:36:30,372
- Can I drive, Uncle Jim ?
- Er, no.

502
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:47,638
Out of the way
or I'll make haggis out of you.

503
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:50,175
Get the sheep out the way.

504
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:11,241
- Are we there yet ?
- Almost. Almost there.

505
00:37:11,514 --> 00:37:14,540
I can see the cottage !

506
00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:35,334
- Shall we explore, Michael ?
- Don't tear your clothes, please.

507
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:38,373
- Come on. Follow me.
- Be careful of stinging nettles.

508
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,374
Hurry up, everyone.

509
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,989
- Would you like to see the rest of it ?
- Mm. Yes.

510
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:12,657
'Ello !

511
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:15,489
Thought you could escape
from Captain Swarthy, eh ?

512
00:38:15,432 --> 00:38:19,564
Off to the ship with you, then.
Off to the ship, son !

513
00:38:21,942 --> 00:38:26,176
So now you can either choose
to become a pirate with the rest of us,

514
00:38:26,448 --> 00:38:29,144
or we'll toss you to the sharks.

515
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:34,523
- How marvelous.
- Well, maybe the crocodiles, eh ?

516
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:38,085
- No one's escaped, Captain.
- Excellent work, matey.

517
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:39,063
Now then.

518
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:42,534
Now is your only chance to speak.

519
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:46,073
Who amongst you is ready
to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea ?

520
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:48,475
- I am !
- Not finished yet.

521
00:38:48,478 --> 00:38:51,845
To enter upon
the most dangerous chapter

522
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:55,317
in your young
and soon-to-be-wasted lives ?

523
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:58,682
What did you say ? What are doing, son ?

524
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:01,891
Are you giggling ? On my ship ?
Giggling ? What did you say ?

525
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:04,360
- I said I'm ready, Captain.
- What's your name, boy ?

526
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,603
I'm Curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

527
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,970
Cut him loose, matey.

528
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,339
Welcome aboard, Curly.
Your job will be to mop the deck.

529
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:17,446
And who be you, young squire ?

530
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:23,023
My name be Nibs the Cut-throat. Feared
by men and greatly desired by the ladies.

531
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:24,014
Jack !

532
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:28,338
Welcome aboard, Nibs.
You shall polish all wood surfaces.

533
00:39:28,281 --> 00:39:30,648
Grab a hold of that rigging.

534
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,150
- And you, lad ?
- I'm Peter.

535
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,978
That's not a pirate name.
What about Dastardly Jim, eh ?

536
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,278
No. Just Peter.

537
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,951
I like my name.

538
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:47,386
Very well.

539
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:53,292
In punishment for lack of an interesting
pirate name, Peter shall walk the plank.

540
00:39:53,064 --> 00:39:55,500
Cut him loose.

541
00:40:17,597 --> 00:40:20,500
- What are you playing again ?
- The boy.

542
00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:22,000
What have you got... ? Excuse me.

543
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:25,506
Mr Barrie, sir ?

544
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:28,772
There's been a mistake here, sir.
It says here I'm to play the nanny.

545
00:40:29,113 --> 00:40:34,314
- I don't imagine I quite fit that part, eh ?
- You're not actually the nanny.

546
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,214
You're a dog.

547
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:38,819
- What ?
- A Newfound land.

548
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:41,026
We'll put you in a great big fluffy dog suit.

549
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:43,565
Rrr.

550
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:46,829
Oh, right.

551
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,201
Actually, we don't have a Tinker Bell cast,
do we ? He could play Tinker Bell.

552
00:40:52,694 --> 00:40:56,597
Heavens, no. Tinker Bell's a light.
It moves around the stage.

553
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:59,170
Just a wee light
that moves around the stage.

554
00:41:02,074 --> 00:41:04,202
Bit worried about this.

555
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:08,242
Let's see.
We've got John Darling, Michael Darling,

556
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:11,177
Tiger Lily, Smee, Skylights.

557
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:15,752
It's a play for puppets.
Tootles, Nibs, Curly.

558
00:41:16,094 --> 00:41:18,689
All these names are absurd
when you see them all together.

559
00:41:18,597 --> 00:41:20,792
Captain Hook, S...

560
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:24,730
Oh, hello, James.

561
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:27,632
You're out of your mind.

562
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:42,458
How were rehearsals ?

563
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:48,091
Fine. Great. They're going... quite well.

564
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:51,504
- Good.
- Yes. Thank you.

565
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:33,062
- Hello.
- Hello.

566
00:42:33,615 --> 00:42:37,985
- How was your journey ?
- It was quite long. I'm exhausted.

567
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:42,142
- Let's get you some tea.
- That'd be nice. Thanks.

568
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:47,410
- Can you come to the playhouse ?
- In a moment, Michael. He's just arrived.

569
00:42:47,182 --> 00:42:53,145
But I said I'd get him. They always
send Peter to do things. I said I'll do it.

570
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,538
- It will spoil the surprise.
- What surprise, darling ?

571
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,181
It's a great surprise. We've taken
most of the day preparing for it.

572
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:06,736
- Everybody's waiting for you.
- Then we mustn't keep them waiting.

573
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:11,064
Please don't tell them that I told you
the surprise. I said I wouldn't.

574
00:43:11,165 --> 00:43:13,031
Oh, well, you didn't really tell us
anything about it, did you ?

575
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:16,962
- Yes I did. It's a play.
- It's a play ?

576
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:31,891
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

577
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,175
"A play in one act
by Peter Llewelyn Davies."

578
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:42,034
- This is just a bit of silliness, really.
- I should hope so. Go on.

579
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,641
I just wanted to take a stab at writing,
you know.

580
00:43:44,843 --> 00:43:47,405
Well, the others do
a good job with it anyway.

581
00:43:47,431 --> 00:43:49,592
Well, let's see it then.

582
00:43:51,803 --> 00:43:55,399
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

583
00:43:55,808 --> 00:43:57,936
"One morning, just after sunrise,

584
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:01,339
Lady Ursula, the most beautiful daughter
of Lord and Lady Dubon,

585
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:06,835
made her way up the steps of the great
cathedral to pray to her blessed saint."

586
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:10,185
"Suddenly, as she reached
the cathedral doors,

587
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,691
the gargoyle that guarded
the sacred structure

588
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:15,593
came to life and swooped down upon her."

589
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,152
"The people of the village all ran to safety,

590
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:23,144
but Lady Ursula slipped
on the cathedral steps

591
00:44:22,977 --> 00:44:27,143
and the gargoyle descended upon her,
wrapping her in its huge wings

592
00:44:27,485 --> 00:44:31,786
and taking her high up into the spires
of the cathedral."

593
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:35,358
- Go on, Peter.
- "Not long after this sorrowful event,

594
00:44:35,528 --> 00:44:40,193
a young knight named JM Barnaby
came into the city."

595
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:43,134
Sylvia.

596
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:45,873
- Do you want some water ?
- Mother ?

597
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:49,468
- No, James.
- Let's get her back to the house. Go on.

598
00:44:53,102 --> 00:44:57,200
She won't discuss it with me at all.
She claims it was nothing.

599
00:44:57,108 --> 00:45:00,272
I tell you, Doctor, she couldn't breathe.

600
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:03,639
You can't very well treat a patient
who won't admit there's anything wrong.

601
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:07,577
Well, you'll have to make her understand
that something is.

602
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:11,389
- I'll try and do my best.
- Great. Just there.

603
00:45:42,169 --> 00:45:44,467
Get your hand flat like that.

604
00:45:45,622 --> 00:45:47,557
Ow.

605
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:50,857
Then... Like that.

606
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:19,509
Come in.

607
00:46:28,431 --> 00:46:32,163
The good doctor didn't feel
up to the challenge on this one.

608
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:35,964
He thinks you need to go to hospital
for further tests.

609
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:39,435
Nonsense.
When would I have time for that ?

610
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:43,679
Besides, this family's
had enough of hospitals.

611
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:48,515
- Perhaps they can help you.
- I know what they can do for me.

612
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:52,123
I saw what they did for my husband.

613
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:55,263
No, James. I've no interest in hospitals.

614
00:46:56,468 --> 00:46:59,063
I'm keenly interested
in having some supper.

615
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:33,307
What did you and Mother decide
to tell us this time ? "It's only a chest cold" ?

616
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,237
- We hadn't decided anything.
- Stop lying to me !

617
00:47:36,155 --> 00:47:39,387
I'm sick of grown-ups lying to me.

618
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,722
I'm not lying to you.
I don't know what's wrong.

619
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:47,026
"Father might take us fishing,"
that's what she said. "ln just a few weeks."

620
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,895
And he died the next morning.

621
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:52,283
That wasn't a lie, Peter.

622
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:53,704
That was your mother's hope.

623
00:47:53,545 --> 00:47:57,950
He barely moved for a week,
but I started planning our fishing trip.

624
00:47:58,102 --> 00:48:02,164
I will never lie to you. I promise you that.

625
00:48:02,273 --> 00:48:05,836
No, all you'll do is teach me
to make up stupid stories

626
00:48:06,113 --> 00:48:10,642
and pretend that things
aren't happening until...

627
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:16,524
I won't ! I'm not blind.

628
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:19,269
I won't be made a fool.

629
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:23,109
What's this ? Peter.

630
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:25,562
The play.

631
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:29,356
Darling, I wanted to see the rest of it.

632
00:48:31,062 --> 00:48:34,522
Magic's gone out of it a bit now,
hasn't it ?

633
00:48:35,018 --> 00:48:37,782
All because of a silly chest cold.

634
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,981
James.

635
00:49:26,087 --> 00:49:28,453
Well, you remember Gilbert Cannan,
don't you ?

636
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,784
Good evening.

637
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:35,794
Mr Cannan has been working on the
committee to fight government censorship.

638
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,592
I know how involved you've been as well.

639
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:43,873
He wanted to speak to you.
I did think you'd be home so much sooner.

640
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,705
It's been a long evening, Mary.

641
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:49,551
Yes.

642
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,383
Well, if I'd realized how late it was,
of course.

643
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:55,354
I should perhaps talk to you
at another time ? Not so late ?

644
00:49:55,627 --> 00:49:57,686
That will be fine.

645
00:50:00,132 --> 00:50:02,225
We'll talk then.

646
00:50:02,134 --> 00:50:05,003
Thank you for your patience, Mrs Barrie.

647
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:06,869
Mr Barrie.

648
00:50:07,142 --> 00:50:09,269
- Good night.
- Night.

649
00:50:26,301 --> 00:50:29,363
Well, aren't you going to speak ?

650
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:32,366
What would you like me to say ?

651
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:36,578
"Curious how late Mr Cannan stayed,"
I suppose.

652
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:40,175
And then, let's see. What comes next ?

653
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:45,159
"No later than you were out, James."

654
00:50:45,193 --> 00:50:47,991
"And how is Mrs Davies this evening ?"

655
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:51,315
Oh, yes, I would have a great answer
for that one, wouldn't I ?

656
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:53,045
How dare you.

657
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,908
This isn't one of your plays.

658
00:50:58,044 --> 00:51:01,811
I know that, Mary. It's quite serious.

659
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,467
But I'm not ready for this conversation,
wherever it may lead.

660
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:12,735
Perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes ?
Good night then.

661
00:52:35,759 --> 00:52:40,527
Mr Barrie. Don't you agree
this is a little bit tight ?

662
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:44,600
- No. No, in fact I think it's quite... baggy.
- Baggy ?

663
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:47,468
Quite frumpy. I'd bring it right in just there.

664
00:52:47,575 --> 00:52:49,167
That's very tight.

665
00:52:49,577 --> 00:52:52,012
And put maybe a plank of wood there
to straighten him up.

666
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,050
- Oh, aye. Yes, Mr Barrie.
- Plank of wood ?

667
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:56,484
Some wood there on the shoulders as well.

668
00:52:56,586 --> 00:53:00,456
- Otherwise, it's marvelous.
- Right, sir.

669
00:53:12,725 --> 00:53:15,627
- You'll be sick tomorrow.
- I'll be sick tonight.

670
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:22,102
James.

671
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:26,006
We're just having some tea.
You remember my mother, of course.

672
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:29,374
Yes. Of course. How do you do ?

673
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:35,604
- May I take your hat ?
- That's enough, boys.

674
00:53:38,978 --> 00:53:41,446
Boys, please don't run in the house.
You'll break something.

675
00:53:41,764 --> 00:53:43,790
Come away from that door.
Come on, come on.

676
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:47,116
- I'd like a word with you,
Mr Barrie, before you go.

677
00:53:46,854 --> 00:53:49,119
We'll only be a few minutes.

678
00:53:49,575 --> 00:53:51,839
Boys, why don't you go
and play in the garden ? Go on.

679
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,424
- Is he in trouble ?
- Sh.

680
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,767
Because I've been alone with Grandmother
and I know what it's like.

681
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:01,934
- Should we retire into the study ?
- Why don't you join them, dear ?

682
00:54:01,624 --> 00:54:03,684
Very well.

683
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,316
- I do apologize for interrupting.
- Would you close the door, please ?

684
00:54:09,468 --> 00:54:11,060
Certainly.

685
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:16,035
Sylvia has told me you have offered her
the services of your household staff.

686
00:54:15,977 --> 00:54:20,245
- Well, not exactly.
- That won't be necessary.

687
00:54:20,616 --> 00:54:22,813
I'll leave that to Sylvia, of course.

688
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,718
You'll leave that to me, Mr Barrie.

689
00:54:25,574 --> 00:54:28,669
You see, I'm moving in here from now on.

690
00:54:28,628 --> 00:54:33,259
- You're moving in ?
- I'm going where I'm most needed.

691
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,164
And I can certainly see to it
that this house is managed

692
00:54:36,388 --> 00:54:38,720
without resorting to your charity.

693
00:54:38,757 --> 00:54:43,661
It isn't charity, Mrs du Maurier.
I was only trying to help, as a friend.

694
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:48,019
Have you no idea how much your
friendship has already cost my daughter ?

695
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:50,918
Or are you really that selfish ?

696
00:54:51,107 --> 00:54:53,737
I beg your pardon ?

697
00:54:53,995 --> 00:54:58,092
Don't you see what a visit
to the summer cottage of a married man

698
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,232
does for a widow's future prospects ?

699
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:06,818
Sylvia needs to find someone.
The boys need a father.

700
00:55:09,716 --> 00:55:14,154
And you are destroying any hope this
family has of pulling itself together again.

701
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:18,023
I have only wanted good things
for this family, Mrs du Maurier.

702
00:55:17,893 --> 00:55:20,523
I'll look after them.

703
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:24,733
You have your own family
to concern yourself with.

704
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:26,534
What are you suggesting ?

705
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:30,533
I'm suggesting that you protect
what you have, Mr Barrie.

706
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,595
That is precisely what I am doing.

707
00:55:56,747 --> 00:56:00,445
I was so certain what I would find in this.

708
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:05,569
Some little confession
would leak out onto the page.

709
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:08,227
I don't write love notes in my journal.

710
00:56:08,262 --> 00:56:10,696
No.

711
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:14,308
Still, you knew who I meant, didn't you ?

712
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:17,084
That's some comfort, actually.

713
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,672
It means I know you just a little after all.

714
00:56:20,695 --> 00:56:24,393
You needn't steal my journal
to get to know me, Mary.

715
00:56:24,483 --> 00:56:29,012
No. I suppose I could just go see the plays.

716
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:36,262
I was hopelessly naive when I married you.

717
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:42,798
I imagined that brilliant people
disappeared to some secret place

718
00:56:42,642 --> 00:56:46,841
where good ideas floated around
like leaves in autumn.

719
00:56:47,398 --> 00:56:52,133
And I hoped, at least once...

720
00:56:53,489 --> 00:56:56,425
you would take me there with you.

721
00:56:56,493 --> 00:56:59,486
There is no such place.

722
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:03,076
Yes, there is.

723
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,715
Neverland.

724
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:11,859
It's the best you've written, James.

725
00:57:11,764 --> 00:57:15,792
And I'm sure the Davies will adore
the world you've created for them.

726
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,315
I only wish I were part of it.

727
00:57:20,225 --> 00:57:23,856
I've wanted you to be. I've tried.

728
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,044
Mary.

729
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:33,891
I always imagined us going off on
great adventures once we were together.

730
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:37,521
But we moved into this house
and you started, I don't know,

731
00:57:37,998 --> 00:57:41,867
- you started rearranging the furniture.
- What was I supposed to do, James ?

732
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:43,905
You were always gone.

733
00:57:43,506 --> 00:57:44,599
I was right here.

734
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:52,008
Sitting in your parlor, staring off
into other worlds as though I didn't exist.

735
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:55,599
Look. Just give me bit more time
to finish up the play.

736
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,625
To spend with your muse ?

737
00:57:57,693 --> 00:58:03,258
No, I'm tired of waiting, James.
I'm tired of looking like a fool.

738
00:58:04,534 --> 00:58:07,903
Well, I can't very well give up the play.

739
00:58:09,008 --> 00:58:11,636
Of course not.

740
00:58:11,961 --> 00:58:17,424
Just come home to me at the end of
the day. Rehearse and be home for dinner.

741
00:58:17,635 --> 00:58:22,597
No more trips to the country,
no more long afternoons in the park.

742
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:26,771
If you can't give us that much of a chance,

743
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,169
then we must end this.

744
00:58:30,954 --> 00:58:33,822
And I will.

745
00:58:38,881 --> 00:58:41,407
Pitiful display.

746
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:49,054
Nanny. Nanny.

747
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:51,489
What ?

748
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:57,269
<i>First you get the pajamas,
then you make the bed.</i>

749
00:58:57,155 --> 00:58:59,317
With my paws ?

750
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:03,061
You make the bed with your paws.
The pajamas you get with your teeth.

751
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:07,783
Because in fact, being a dog,
you haven't any proper digits, have you ?

752
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:11,315
Well, I don't have any teeth, either.

753
00:59:11,258 --> 00:59:13,819
I mean, I can't see. I can't breathe.

754
00:59:14,128 --> 00:59:17,257
All I've got is this rubbery snout.

755
00:59:20,136 --> 00:59:24,234
- Can we get him some teeth ?
- He can have mine.

756
00:59:24,142 --> 00:59:26,372
We'll get you teeth.

757
00:59:26,645 --> 00:59:30,105
- Let's have a wee break, shall we ?
- Right.

758
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:34,421
- I thought you were wonderful.
- You were marvelous.

759
00:59:34,874 --> 00:59:36,899
I think you're better on four legs
than you are on two.

760
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:39,402
- Oh, give it a rest.
- I do.

761
00:59:40,882 --> 00:59:43,908
- Just say it, Charles, go on.
- Well, you picture it, James.

762
00:59:43,885 --> 00:59:47,550
Opening night, doctors, lawyers,
businessmen and their wives,

763
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,358
all dressed to the nines.

764
00:59:49,392 --> 00:59:54,491
They've paid good money, they're
expecting theater, what we call theater.

765
00:59:54,399 --> 00:59:58,701
The curtain opens and it's crocodiles
and fairies and pirates and lndians.

766
00:59:58,906 --> 01:00:02,308
I don't even know what it is.

767
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:06,745
But you did know, Charles. You're
an absolute genius, Charles. That's it.

768
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:08,767
Oh, don't patronize me, James.

769
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:11,930
You know how much money I put into
this show that I haven't even found yet ?

770
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:15,371
Listen, listen. Opening night,
I want 25 seats set aside.

771
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:17,304
- Set aside ? 25 ?
- 25 seats.

772
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,910
Scattered throughout the theater.
Two here, two there, three up there.

773
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:22,243
- Are they paying for it ?
- They're filled.

774
01:00:22,187 --> 01:00:24,621
- No, no, no. I'm asking...
- The seats are filled.

775
01:00:24,691 --> 01:00:27,286
- Uncle Jim ?
- Hello, boys.

776
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:28,992
Could I speak to you for a moment,
please ?

777
01:00:28,696 --> 01:00:30,426
Certainly.

778
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:33,726
25 seats, Charles. It'll be great.
It'll be fantastic.

779
01:00:33,703 --> 01:00:35,295
25 scattered seats ?
Who's paying for them ?

780
01:00:35,204 --> 01:00:36,229
Throughout the theater.

781
01:00:36,707 --> 01:00:40,200
- Who's paying for these 25 seats ?
- They're filled-up seats, Charles.

782
01:00:40,211 --> 01:00:42,339
Whoa. Look.

783
01:00:42,214 --> 01:00:44,979
This is great. I'm flying.

784
01:00:45,085 --> 01:00:49,420
We don't need to use much pull at all, see ?
As long as we've got the balance down.

785
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:52,193
Mother asked me to take the boys out
for the afternoon.

786
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:54,973
She said she only wanted a bit of quiet,

787
01:00:54,814 --> 01:00:59,185
but she was trembling so badly
she couldn't even finish her tea.

788
01:00:59,237 --> 01:01:02,401
I'm not a fool, Uncle James.
I deserve to know the truth.

789
01:01:02,607 --> 01:01:05,976
I don't know the truth.
She won't talk about it.

790
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,389
But you think it's serious ?

791
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:13,370
It could be. The doctor felt
she should go and have some tests.

792
01:01:13,506 --> 01:01:15,337
Then you'll have to convince her
to go then.

793
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:17,909
I've tried. She won't listen to me.

794
01:01:19,097 --> 01:01:20,257
And lately, to be quite honest,

795
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:24,833
it seems that all my best intentions for
your family have come to nothing but harm.

796
01:01:25,105 --> 01:01:27,369
Apparently I've made
quite a mess of things.

797
01:01:27,608 --> 01:01:30,807
It's Grandmother, isn't it ?
She's run you off, hasn't she ?

798
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:36,014
Oh, she's absolutely tried with great effort.
And perhaps with good reason.

799
01:01:35,903 --> 01:01:39,431
It isn't you, Uncle Jim. She just...

800
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:43,778
She just doesn't want
to see Mother hurt anymore.

801
01:01:47,302 --> 01:01:50,237
Look at that.

802
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:52,969
How magnificent.

803
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:56,104
The boy's gone.

804
01:01:58,517 --> 01:02:03,956
Somewhere during the last 30 seconds,
you've become a grown-up.

805
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:07,555
Right then. I think you should be the one
to talk to her, George.

806
01:02:07,862 --> 01:02:13,666
- But I wouldn't know what to say.
- You'll do fine. You'll do just fine.

807
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:16,937
Mr Barrie, sir. Sorry to interrupt.

808
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:20,840
- It's Nana, he's expired backstage.
- What's happened ?

809
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,911
I think his costume is too tight.

810
01:02:24,184 --> 01:02:29,590
It's not possible, too tight.
George, give me a minute, I'll be back.

811
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:37,680
Pull that one tight.
Here, last one.

812
01:02:39,405 --> 01:02:41,532
OK. Flap those wings.

813
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,706
- There you go.
- Whoa !

814
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:47,047
- Can I have a go ?
- Yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

815
01:02:47,082 --> 01:02:48,550
Give that a tug. Go on.

816
01:02:48,584 --> 01:02:50,951
- Just give it a little pull.
- Can I have a go ?

817
01:02:51,088 --> 01:02:52,487
- In a minute. In a minute.
- Can I have a go ?

818
01:02:52,589 --> 01:02:54,581
- Jack. Pull me higher.
- I have to concentrate.

819
01:02:54,592 --> 01:02:56,220
- Stop it now, boys.
- No, Michael.

820
01:02:56,428 --> 01:02:57,986
Stop mucking about, boys. Come on now.

821
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,899
- I want to do it now.
- No, don't go down there.

822
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:01,511
What are you... ?

823
01:03:04,272 --> 01:03:05,865
Ow !

824
01:03:10,113 --> 01:03:12,378
Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

825
01:03:12,366 --> 01:03:15,495
- I'm so sorry.
- George ?

826
01:03:21,628 --> 01:03:23,028
Mr Barrie ?

827
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:26,761
Mrs Davies would like a word with you.

828
01:03:27,052 --> 01:03:29,385
No, just Mr Barrie.

829
01:03:45,627 --> 01:03:50,931
- Did you encourage this ?
- Encourage what ?

830
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:55,166
Oh, James, please.
You know perfectly well what.

831
01:03:56,008 --> 01:04:02,279
George won't allow them to set his arm
unless I submit to an examination.

832
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:06,933
I see. Well, I suppose you'll have to then,

833
01:04:07,273 --> 01:04:12,371
because he's quite a stubborn young man
when he sets his mind to it.

834
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:17,333
This is absurd.
They won't tell me anything different.

835
01:04:17,037 --> 01:04:19,505
Different ?

836
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:22,135
So you've already spoken to a doctor then ?

837
01:04:22,544 --> 01:04:25,308
That is not your concern.

838
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:35,205
My understanding is that my condition
may be quite serious.

839
01:04:35,444 --> 01:04:40,248
However... my wish is that
life should go on as normal.

840
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:42,692
So,

841
01:04:43,205 --> 01:04:45,800
I'll have the examination,

842
01:04:45,709 --> 01:04:48,837
and I'll take whatever medications
they advise.

843
01:04:48,712 --> 01:04:51,547
But I don't want to know what they're for.

844
01:04:51,717 --> 01:04:55,814
And I don't want you inquiring into it
any further.

845
01:04:56,724 --> 01:04:59,090
Wouldn't dream of it.

846
01:05:17,835 --> 01:05:19,929
Mary ?

847
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,105
Mary ?

848
01:05:45,205 --> 01:05:48,107
Peter, could you help George
to fold a pocket handkerchief, please ?

849
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:51,592
- They're in the linen cupboard. Darling ?
- Yes, Mother.

850
01:05:51,296 --> 01:05:55,394
Jack, how do you manage
to always come untucked ?

851
01:05:55,635 --> 01:05:57,832
Would you check your shirt-tails
in the intermission, please ?

852
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,368
Yes, Mother.

853
01:05:59,641 --> 01:06:02,076
You're not planning on attending
any after-theater events, are you ?

854
01:06:02,145 --> 01:06:05,844
Only for a short time if we do. The tickets !

855
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,011
- With the children ?
- George !

856
01:06:07,852 --> 01:06:10,913
Um, possibly. Would you see
if George has the tickets, please ?

857
01:06:10,856 --> 01:06:14,315
- I'll just check the dressing table.
- Sylvia, there's a...

858
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:19,425
Mother, please see if George has
the tickets. Michael, where are your socks ?

859
01:06:19,368 --> 01:06:21,701
Wait here, don't move.

860
01:06:56,334 --> 01:06:59,236
Take her feet, George.

861
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:03,758
We'll need some more blankets.

862
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,949
Oh, take Michael with you, would you ?

863
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:14,721
She looks much worse
than when we were at the cottage.

864
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:18,156
Sh, Michael.

865
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:20,990
- Those 25 seats, has anyone shown up ?
- No, sir. Not yet.

866
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:23,469
Precisely. Have there been
many people asking for seats ?

867
01:07:24,005 --> 01:07:24,994
- Yes, sir.
- Charles.

868
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:27,066
I suggest you start selling them.
Yes, James ?

869
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,973
Have you seen any of the Davies family
yet this evening ?

870
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:29,976
The 25 seats, are they filled ?

871
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,876
- It's taken care of.
- Yes. Yes.

872
01:07:32,183 --> 01:07:35,243
Who did you invite ? Because obviously
whoever you invited decided not to come.

873
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,832
- The seats will be filled, I promise.
- Yes. You've been promising me all...

874
01:07:37,774 --> 01:07:39,401
- Charles ?
- Hello, Mr Stanley.

875
01:07:39,776 --> 01:07:41,506
Have you seen the Davies family
this evening ?

876
01:07:41,279 --> 01:07:42,268
No, sir.

877
01:07:43,114 --> 01:07:46,346
- Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.
- Oh, no, Mother. I don't need a doctor.

878
01:07:46,118 --> 01:07:48,212
Yes, you do, dear.

879
01:07:50,124 --> 01:07:53,185
I think I'll get some camomile
to help you relax.

880
01:07:53,128 --> 01:07:57,122
Peter will be here if you need anything.

881
01:08:03,141 --> 01:08:04,803
Peter.

882
01:08:05,144 --> 01:08:07,204
Peter.

883
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:17,523
Can I do anything, Mother ?

884
01:08:17,695 --> 01:08:19,788
No, darling.

885
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,532
You must go to the play.

886
01:08:24,704 --> 01:08:28,801
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

887
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:31,235
I need you to.

888
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:36,417
I need you to come back tonight
and tell me every bit of it.

889
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:38,214
Please.

890
01:08:38,054 --> 01:08:41,116
It's only a play, Mother.

891
01:08:41,059 --> 01:08:43,960
It doesn't matter.

892
01:08:48,452 --> 01:08:50,717
What do you want ?

893
01:08:50,955 --> 01:08:53,753
Take it out.

894
01:08:55,962 --> 01:08:58,727
Open it.

895
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:11,145
I've never been so proud of you.

896
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,403
Last call, please, ladies and gentlemen.
Last call.

897
01:09:27,255 --> 01:09:30,281
Yes, yes, yes. It's all right. They know.

898
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:34,274
We had time to sell those 25 seats.
The play's starting.

899
01:09:46,563 --> 01:09:47,588
- Charles.
- What ?

900
01:09:47,564 --> 01:09:51,525
- They're here.
- Who's here ?

901
01:09:54,574 --> 01:09:58,170
Do forgive them being a bit late -
short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

902
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:00,310
I'm not clear what they're doing here.

903
01:10:00,582 --> 01:10:02,175
- They've come to see the play.
- Mm-hm.

904
01:10:02,085 --> 01:10:03,985
- That's the 25 seats.
- Mm.

905
01:10:04,087 --> 01:10:08,253
25 seats given to orphans. Right.
Now my nightmare is complete.

906
01:10:08,592 --> 01:10:10,653
You can start your play now.

907
01:10:10,596 --> 01:10:12,656
<i>Your play.</i>

908
01:10:17,655 --> 01:10:20,625
Get them in the scattered seats.

909
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:38,892
Just there, boys.

910
01:11:10,344 --> 01:11:13,438
Excuse me, sir. This way.

911
01:11:13,347 --> 01:11:15,407
Thank you.

912
01:11:15,851 --> 01:11:18,945
Looks like we got
one of the better-dressed ones.

913
01:11:19,355 --> 01:11:23,817
I just want you to know,
I think you're a wonderful dog.

914
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:26,092
Thanks.

915
01:12:25,778 --> 01:12:29,715
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

916
01:12:29,366 --> 01:12:31,198
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.

917
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:33,968
Two minutes more.

918
01:12:33,755 --> 01:12:36,191
<i>Please. One minute more.</i>

919
01:12:36,543 --> 01:12:41,345
Nana, I will not be bathed.
I tell you, I will not be bathed.

920
01:12:46,356 --> 01:12:48,951
Who are you ?

921
01:12:55,535 --> 01:13:00,236
No one there. Yet I feel sure I saw a face.

922
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:03,477
My children.

923
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:08,097
- How is she ?
- She's resting.

924
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,236
- May I see her ?
- No, Mr Barrie.

925
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:13,164
I don't think we need to include you in
everything that goes on in this household.

926
01:13:13,425 --> 01:13:15,621
- But she'd want to see him.
- Be quiet, George.

927
01:13:15,428 --> 01:13:16,794
And since, as I've discovered,

928
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:20,725
you've seen fit to conceal certain facts
about my daughter's condition from me,

929
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:24,062
I feel no remorse at excluding you
from my home.

930
01:13:23,855 --> 01:13:24,982
But you can't...

931
01:13:25,358 --> 01:13:28,887
- Go upstairs, George, now.
- Stop ordering me about.

932
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,058
This isn't your home. It's our home.

933
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:33,335
Just cos Mother's
needed your help recently

934
01:13:33,369 --> 01:13:35,634
doesn't give you the right
to rule over her existence.

935
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:38,035
She's not a child anymore,
and neither am I.

936
01:13:38,342 --> 01:13:40,743
If she wants to see Uncle Jim,
she can see Uncle Jim.

937
01:13:40,713 --> 01:13:43,808
There's nothing you can do about it.

938
01:13:47,638 --> 01:13:50,733
- Mother ?
- Yes, darling ?

939
01:13:53,146 --> 01:13:55,809
James.

940
01:13:55,649 --> 01:13:58,414
No. Your play.

941
01:14:01,157 --> 01:14:04,218
Look at all this.

942
01:14:04,161 --> 01:14:06,460
I'd have come tonight, it's just...

943
01:14:06,664 --> 01:14:09,792
- Mother, you need to rest.
- ..l still have things to do here.

944
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,849
See ? This needs mending.

945
01:14:13,724 --> 01:14:17,251
Four boys, no end of patches.

946
01:14:17,228 --> 01:14:20,063
Can't seem to keep up.

947
01:14:21,183 --> 01:14:24,018
I haven't the time for all this.

948
01:14:24,822 --> 01:14:30,694
Don't look at me like that, James.
You make me feel so utterly exposed.

949
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:37,996
Boys, would you give me a moment
with your mother, please ? Thank you.

950
01:14:57,783 --> 01:15:00,514
They can see it, you know.

951
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:04,189
You can't go on just pretending.

952
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:08,229
"Just pretending" ?

953
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:14,237
You brought pretending
into this family, James.

954
01:15:15,807 --> 01:15:18,868
You showed us we can change things
by simply believing them to be different.

955
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:21,303
A lot of things, Sylvia, not everything.

956
01:15:21,315 --> 01:15:24,546
But the things that matter.

957
01:15:25,603 --> 01:15:32,169
We've pretended for some time now
that you're a part of this family, haven't we ?

958
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:44,255
You've come to mean so much to us all
that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

959
01:15:47,633 --> 01:15:50,000
And even if it isn't true,

960
01:15:50,854 --> 01:15:53,824
even if that can never be...

961
01:15:56,362 --> 01:15:59,298
I need to go on pretending.

962
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:03,497
Until the end.

963
01:16:05,874 --> 01:16:07,968
With you.

964
01:16:08,879 --> 01:16:13,214
- Oh, I am sweet.
- How do you do it ?

965
01:16:13,551 --> 01:16:18,114
You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts
and they lift you up in the air.

966
01:16:21,012 --> 01:16:26,543
You are so nippy at it.
Couldn't you do it very slowly once ?

967
01:16:30,441 --> 01:16:34,378
Yes, I've got it now, Wendy.

968
01:16:34,446 --> 01:16:37,747
I must blow fairy dust on you first.

969
01:16:47,431 --> 01:16:49,957
Now try. Try it from the beds.

970
01:16:50,518 --> 01:16:54,455
Just wriggle your shoulders like this
and then let go.

971
01:16:56,109 --> 01:16:59,273
- I flew !
- How ripping !

972
01:16:59,814 --> 01:17:01,840
Now join hands.

973
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:08,740
- Look at me !
- I do like it !

974
01:17:10,829 --> 01:17:14,129
- Bravo !
- Let's go out.

975
01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:18,405
Second on the right
and straight on till morning.

976
01:17:18,473 --> 01:17:20,771
Genius.

977
01:17:24,597 --> 01:17:29,468
- Sylvia, don't move.
- I feel a little better.

978
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:33,234
- It's been a bad day, that's all.

979
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:37,580
Now I want you to go back to the theater.

980
01:17:37,614 --> 01:17:40,175
Find Peter.

981
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:44,180
- Of course.
- Thank you.

982
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:51,759
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can do for you ?

983
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:54,728
No.

984
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,268
Well,

985
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,374
I have always wanted to go to Neverland.

986
01:18:01,814 --> 01:18:04,875
You did promise to tell me about it,
you know.

987
01:18:05,401 --> 01:18:08,395
Aye. That I did.

988
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:12,978
It's a bit late for it tonight though, I'm afraid.

989
01:18:14,581 --> 01:18:18,040
Perhaps some time soon though ?

990
01:18:24,979 --> 01:18:27,608
Most definitely.

991
01:18:27,482 --> 01:18:32,717
- D'you mean we shall both be drowned ?
- Look how the water is rising.

992
01:18:35,993 --> 01:18:39,556
It must be the tail of the kite
we made for Michael.

993
01:18:39,498 --> 01:18:44,836
You remember. It tore itself
out of his hands and floated away.

994
01:18:46,007 --> 01:18:50,571
- The kite. Why shouldn't it carry you ?
- Both of us.

995
01:18:51,514 --> 01:18:54,848
It can't lift two. Michael and Curly tried.

996
01:18:54,518 --> 01:18:57,613
I won't go without you, Peter.

997
01:18:58,023 --> 01:19:00,584
Let us draw lots which is to stay behind.

998
01:19:00,526 --> 01:19:03,519
And you a lady ? Never.

999
01:19:06,534 --> 01:19:08,093
Ready, Wendy ?

1000
01:19:08,037 --> 01:19:10,005
Peter !

1001
01:19:10,039 --> 01:19:12,509
Don't let go, Wendy.

1002
01:19:12,543 --> 01:19:15,011
Peter, I'm frightened.

1003
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:17,914
Hang on, Wendy !

1004
01:19:19,552 --> 01:19:21,417
Peter !

1005
01:19:21,054 --> 01:19:24,890
To die will be an awfully big adventure.

1006
01:19:41,332 --> 01:19:43,892
- I'm glad you came.
- Well...

1007
01:19:45,337 --> 01:19:48,967
I've never missed an opening.

1008
01:19:48,841 --> 01:19:50,935
So I...

1009
01:19:51,845 --> 01:19:54,872
assume you heard about Gilbert and I.

1010
01:19:54,849 --> 01:19:56,750
Yes.

1011
01:19:57,853 --> 01:20:00,185
Quite the scandal, so I'm told.

1012
01:20:07,866 --> 01:20:10,598
How are you ?

1013
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,744
I'm all right.

1014
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,372
How are you ?

1015
01:20:21,386 --> 01:20:24,116
I'm sorry.

1016
01:20:26,892 --> 01:20:29,589
Don't be.

1017
01:20:29,896 --> 01:20:35,063
Without that family, you could
never have written anything like this.

1018
01:20:34,903 --> 01:20:37,498
You need them.

1019
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:47,250
Goodbye.

1020
01:20:58,552 --> 01:21:00,885
- Mr Barrie.
- Mrs Snow.

1021
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:05,426
Thank you. That was quite the nicest
evening I've ever spent in the theater.

1022
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,657
Very kind of you to say. Thank you.
Where's Mr Snow this evening ?

1023
01:21:09,066 --> 01:21:10,260
Oh.

1024
01:21:10,067 --> 01:21:12,935
I'm afraid he's left us.

1025
01:21:13,072 --> 01:21:16,064
And he would so have loved this evening.

1026
01:21:16,075 --> 01:21:18,567
The pirates and the lndians.

1027
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,949
He was really just a boy himself, you know.

1028
01:21:22,584 --> 01:21:25,316
To the very end.

1029
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,855
I'm terribly sorry. How are you doing ?

1030
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:33,053
I'm doing well enough now, thank you.

1031
01:21:32,981 --> 01:21:38,250
I suppose it's all the work
of the ticking crocodile, isn't it ?

1032
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:43,508
Time is chasing after all of us.
Isn't that right ?

1033
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,524
- That's right, Mrs Snow.
- Aunt Rose, your drink.

1034
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:50,993
Thank you. I mustn't keep you.
You've a lot of friends here.

1035
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,568
Well, it's lovely to see you.
I'm terribly sorry, once again.

1036
01:21:56,046 --> 01:21:59,882
- Was that Mr Barrie ?
- That was Mr Barrie.

1037
01:22:00,052 --> 01:22:02,816
Well done, Mr Barrie.

1038
01:22:03,056 --> 01:22:05,890
- Good show.
- Well done.

1039
01:22:09,231 --> 01:22:12,065
Psst.

1040
01:22:12,284 --> 01:22:14,379
What did you think ?

1041
01:22:14,872 --> 01:22:17,842
- It's about our summer together, isn't it ?
- It is.

1042
01:22:17,876 --> 01:22:20,072
- About all of us.
- That's right.

1043
01:22:21,881 --> 01:22:24,578
Did you like it ?

1044
01:22:24,885 --> 01:22:27,582
It's magical. Thank you.

1045
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:30,290
Oh, thank you.

1046
01:22:30,392 --> 01:22:32,190
Thank you, Peter.

1047
01:22:32,395 --> 01:22:36,492
- This is Peter Pan ! How wonderful.
- Really ?

1048
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:40,361
You're Peter Pan ? Why, you must be
quite the little adventurer.

1049
01:22:40,356 --> 01:22:43,554
Look, it's true.
He has no shadow.

1050
01:22:44,862 --> 01:22:47,354
But I'm not Peter Pan.

1051
01:22:47,532 --> 01:22:49,967
He is.

1052
01:23:00,383 --> 01:23:05,048
And there's been no improvement
since my last visit ?

1053
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:06,949
No.

1054
01:23:12,316 --> 01:23:15,775
Has James been by at all today, Mother ?

1055
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,505
Dr Brighton. May I have a word ?

1056
01:23:22,162 --> 01:23:24,859
Excuse me a moment.

1057
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:32,763
You haven't been keeping him from me,
have you ?

1058
01:23:32,843 --> 01:23:35,074
As a matter of fact,
I actually hoped he might come.

1059
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:37,900
Would have proved me wrong about him.

1060
01:23:37,934 --> 01:23:39,799
Of course, with the success of his play,

1061
01:23:40,152 --> 01:23:44,214
the whole of London
must be knocking at his door.

1062
01:23:47,863 --> 01:23:50,024
I'm sorry, dear.

1063
01:23:53,871 --> 01:23:57,171
- What is it ?
- It's a secret.

1064
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:59,937
- Quiet, Michael.
- I didn't say anything.

1065
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:02,608
Mother, could you come downstairs
for a moment ?

1066
01:24:03,133 --> 01:24:05,865
Oh, she can't come downstairs.
What are you thinking of, George ?

1067
01:24:05,938 --> 01:24:10,467
Actually, I think a trip downstairs
might do her good, ma'am.

1068
01:24:19,322 --> 01:24:23,192
- What have you been up to ?
- Just wait and see.

1069
01:24:31,722 --> 01:24:33,884
It's a play.

1070
01:24:33,642 --> 01:24:37,511
<i>It's not just a play, Michael.
It's the play.</i>

1071
01:24:38,682 --> 01:24:42,050
Of course, we'll have to make do
with a few compromises.

1072
01:24:42,687 --> 01:24:44,781
Much of it will have to be imagined.

1073
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:48,058
- As it should be.
- As it should be, that's right.

1074
01:24:56,005 --> 01:24:59,464
Michael, come and sit here,
next to Mum.

1075
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:05,783
When you're ready.

1076
01:25:31,837 --> 01:25:34,431
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

1077
01:25:34,724 --> 01:25:39,993
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.
Two minutes more. Please.

1078
01:25:40,064 --> 01:25:43,729
- You know fairies, Peter ?
- Yes.

1079
01:25:44,487 --> 01:25:46,979
But they're nearly all dead now.

1080
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:51,691
You see, Wendy, when the first baby
laughed for the first time,

1081
01:25:51,997 --> 01:25:56,129
the laugh broke into a thousand pieces
and they all went skipping about

1082
01:25:56,286 --> 01:25:58,345
and that was the beginning of fairies.

1083
01:25:58,288 --> 01:26:03,728
And now when every new baby is born,
its first laugh becomes a fairy.

1084
01:26:03,796 --> 01:26:07,097
So there ought to be one fairy
for every boy and girl.

1085
01:26:07,301 --> 01:26:10,396
- Ought to be ? lsn't there ?
- Oh, no.

1086
01:26:10,472 --> 01:26:15,035
Children know such a lot now.
Soon, they don't believe in fairies.

1087
01:26:14,978 --> 01:26:18,643
And every time a child says,
"l don't believe in fairies,"

1088
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:22,132
there's a fairy somewhere
that falls down dead.

1089
01:26:25,793 --> 01:26:28,888
Who is that ?

1090
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:32,961
The redskins were defeated ?

1091
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:37,482
Wendy and the boys
captured by the pirates ?

1092
01:26:37,558 --> 01:26:40,460
I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her !

1093
01:26:42,599 --> 01:26:45,330
Oh, that's just my medicine.

1094
01:26:45,769 --> 01:26:49,797
Poisoned ? Who could have poisoned it ?

1095
01:26:51,861 --> 01:26:55,559
Why, Tink. You've drunk my medicine.

1096
01:26:57,669 --> 01:27:00,639
<i>It was poisoned.</i>

1097
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:05,009
And you drank it to save my life ?

1098
01:27:06,881 --> 01:27:09,043
Tink.

1099
01:27:10,386 --> 01:27:13,220
Are you dying ?

1100
01:27:17,229 --> 01:27:19,664
Her light is growing faint.

1101
01:27:21,235 --> 01:27:25,229
If it goes out, that means she's dead.

1102
01:27:27,459 --> 01:27:31,157
Her voice is so low I can scarcely hear
what she's saying.

1103
01:27:30,964 --> 01:27:34,924
She says she thinks
she could get well again

1104
01:27:34,835 --> 01:27:37,703
if children believed in fairies.

1105
01:27:44,349 --> 01:27:47,318
Do you believe in fairies ?

1106
01:27:48,821 --> 01:27:52,087
Say quick that you believe.

1107
01:27:54,779 --> 01:27:57,840
If you believe, clap your hands.

1108
01:27:59,502 --> 01:28:02,666
Clap louder.

1109
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,775
Thank you. Thank you.

1110
01:28:54,026 --> 01:28:56,689
That is Neverland.

1111
01:30:20,192 --> 01:30:22,991
So many perfect days.

1112
01:30:24,197 --> 01:30:28,863
I really began to believe
we'd go on like that forever.

1113
01:30:29,204 --> 01:30:31,469
Oh, stop it.

1114
01:30:31,457 --> 01:30:34,621
She wasn't going to stay with you forever.

1115
01:30:35,462 --> 01:30:38,921
She had a husband. My father.

1116
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:42,396
She never cared for you
the way she did for him.

1117
01:30:43,589 --> 01:30:46,685
I'm not trying to replace your father, Peter.

1118
01:30:47,094 --> 01:30:50,030
I could never do that.

1119
01:30:57,325 --> 01:30:59,385
You'd best let him go.

1120
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:07,199
George, would you take the boys back
to the house ? I'll be with you in a moment.

1121
01:31:07,589 --> 01:31:09,649
Go on, dear.

1122
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:19,229
I'm terribly sorry.

1123
01:31:20,106 --> 01:31:23,543
I've ruined everything I've touched
in this family.

1124
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:26,239
Stop giving yourself so much credit.

1125
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:30,449
Peter's grieving.
It has nothing to do with you.

1126
01:31:31,655 --> 01:31:34,056
Perhaps if I just had
a bit more time with him.

1127
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:37,323
No, Mr Barrie. That won't be good enough.

1128
01:31:37,663 --> 01:31:43,934
If "a bit more time" is all you can provide,
you'd better leave him alone.

1129
01:31:45,424 --> 01:31:49,293
I know you don't much care for me,
Mrs du Maurier, and I respect that,

1130
01:31:49,429 --> 01:31:53,093
but I loved your daughter very much.

1131
01:31:53,434 --> 01:31:55,801
And I love those boys.

1132
01:31:55,937 --> 01:31:57,997
And I think they need me right now.

1133
01:31:57,940 --> 01:32:00,033
Is that so ?

1134
01:31:59,942 --> 01:32:02,174
And for how long after ?

1135
01:32:03,448 --> 01:32:05,541
Meaning what ?

1136
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:10,754
Sylvia has requested a co-guardianship
for the boys in her will.

1137
01:32:10,957 --> 01:32:15,487
You, Mr Barrie, and myself.

1138
01:32:17,967 --> 01:32:23,339
- And what do you have to say about that ?
- I shall respect my daughter's wishes.

1139
01:32:23,275 --> 01:32:28,043
Something I should have done more of
while she was alive.

1140
01:32:29,783 --> 01:32:31,752
But if you feel you're not ready
for such a commitment,

1141
01:32:31,786 --> 01:32:37,192
I assure you I can certainly
look after the boys by myself.

1142
01:32:37,294 --> 01:32:40,422
Do you think I could abandon those boys ?

1143
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:52,006
Sit down, Peter.

1144
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:15,800
Mother pasted it back together

1145
01:33:15,595 --> 01:33:17,928
after I ruined it.

1146
01:33:19,099 --> 01:33:21,159
And then I saw the play.

1147
01:33:21,102 --> 01:33:25,972
I just started writing
and I haven't been able to stop.

1148
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:30,877
She would be very pleased to know that.

1149
01:33:34,621 --> 01:33:38,854
Listen. I've just spoken
with your grandmother

1150
01:33:40,128 --> 01:33:42,323
and I'm staying.

1151
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:45,066
For good.

1152
01:33:47,638 --> 01:33:50,233
I'm sorry I was so horrible.

1153
01:33:51,394 --> 01:33:53,453
Don't worry.

1154
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:59,927
It's just...

1155
01:33:59,904 --> 01:34:03,205
I thought she'd always be here.

1156
01:34:05,078 --> 01:34:07,138
So did I.

1157
01:34:09,084 --> 01:34:11,279
But, in fact...

1158
01:34:13,956 --> 01:34:16,585
she is.

1159
01:34:16,343 --> 01:34:21,510
Because she's on every page
of your imagination.

1160
01:34:22,885 --> 01:34:26,084
You'll always have her there. Always.

1161
01:34:31,865 --> 01:34:35,495
But why did she have to die ?

1162
01:34:42,628 --> 01:34:44,892
I don't know, boy.

1163
01:34:49,388 --> 01:34:51,948
When I think of your mother...

1164
01:34:52,893 --> 01:34:55,920
I will always remember
how happy she looked

1165
01:34:55,897 --> 01:34:58,127
sitting there in the parlor,

1166
01:34:58,266 --> 01:35:01,135
watching a play about her family.

1167
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:05,091
About her boys that never grew up.

1168
01:35:08,363 --> 01:35:10,832
She went to Neverland.

1169
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:18,275
And you can visit her any time you like

1170
01:35:18,377 --> 01:35:21,244
if you just go there yourself.

1171
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:26,444
How ?

1172
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:29,552
By believing, Peter.

1173
01:35:29,392 --> 01:35:31,883
Just believe.

1174
01:35:45,213 --> 01:35:47,648
I can see her.
