Why, hello there,
Mr. Neff.

00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:42,086
Working pretty late, aren't you, Mr. Neff?
- Late enough. Let's ride.

8
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:46,641
You look kind of all in, at that.
- I'm fine.

9
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:50,439
How is the insurance business, Mr. Neff?
- Okay.

10
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,248
They wouldn't ever sell me any.

11
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:53,968
They said I have something
loose in my heart.

Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

21
00:04:57,158 --> 00:04:59,453
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

22
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:03,156
Dear Keyes...

23
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:06,944
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

24
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:09,282
Well, I don't like the word confession.

25
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:11,381
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see...

26
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:14,130
...because it was smack up
against your nose.

27
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,219
You think you're such a hot
potato as a Claims Manager...

28
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,039
...such a wolf on a phony claim.

29
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:24,245
Maybe you are, but let's take a
look at that Dietrichson claim.

30
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:26,895
Accident and double indemnity.

31
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:30,522
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

32
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,441
You said it wasn't an accident. Check.

33
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,346
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

34
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:39,697
You said it was murder. Check.

35
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,165
You thought you had it cold,
didn't you?

36
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:47,284
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

37
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:49,384
It was perfect.

38
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:52,282
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

39
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:54,677
...just one little mistake.

40
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,828
When it came to picking the
killer, you picked the wrong guy.

41
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:03,067
You want to know who killed Dietrichson?

42
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:07,077
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

43
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:08,954
I killed Dietrichson.

44
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:12,029
Me, Walter Neff,
insurance salesman.

45
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:15,697
35 years old, unmarried,
no visible scars...

46
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,510
...until a while ago, that is.

47
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:22,358
Yes, I killed him.

48
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,526
I killed him for money...

49
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,626
...and for a woman.

50
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:33,379
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

51
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:36,991
Pretty, isn't it?

...[Buzzing stops]

54
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:51,824
It all began last May.

55
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:55,413
Around the end of May, it was.

56
00:06:56,061 --> 00:07:00,009
I'd been out to Glendale to deliver
a policy on some dairy trucks.

57
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:03,478
On the way back I remembered this
auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.

58
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:05,578
So I drove over there.

59
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:07,326
It was one of those
California Spanish houses...

60
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,634
...everyone was nuts about
10 or 15 years ago.

61
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,712
This one must've cost somebody
about $30,000.

62
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:15,962
That is, if he ever finished paying for it.

63
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,062
[Doorbell ringing]

64
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,160
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?

65
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,639
Who wants to see him?
- My name is Neff. Walter Neff.

66
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:25,817
If you're selling something...
- Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to...

67
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:26,996
...and it's not magazine subscriptions.

68
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:29,355
Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not in.
- How soon do you expect him?

69
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:31,554
He'll be home when he gets
here, if that's any help to you.

70
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:33,273
(Phyllis) What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

71
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:35,073
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

72
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,700
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson.
What is it?

73
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,190
How do you do,
Mrs. Dietrichson?

74
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,109
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.

75
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:44,209
Pacific all what?
- The Pacific All Risk Insurance Company.

76
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:46,187
It's about some renewals
on the automobiles.

77
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:48,706
I've been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks...

78
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,825
...but he's never in his office.
- Is there anything I can do?

79
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:53,344
The insurance ran out on the 15th.

80
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:55,443
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

81
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,062
...or something while you're not...

82
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:59,162
...fully covered.

83
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,680
Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. Neff.

84
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,287
I've just been taking a sunbath.
- No pigeons around, I hope.

85
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:09,376
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...

86
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:10,736
Oh, that's all right.

87
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:13,214
If you'll wait till I put
something on, I'll be right down.

88
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:16,969
Nettie, show Mr. Neff into the living room.

89
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:19,891
Where would the living room be?

90
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:22,290
In there, but they keep the liquor locked up.

91
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,960
It's all right.
I always carry my own keys.

92
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:33,904
(Walter) The living room was still stuffy...

93
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:36,384
...from last night's cigars.

94
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:37,523
The windows were closed...

95
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:39,522
...and the sunshine coming in
through the venetian blinds...

96
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:42,427
...showed up the dust in the air.

97
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,518
On the piano, in a couple of fancy
frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...

98
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:49,508
...his daughter by his first wife.

99
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,076
They had a bowl of those
little red goldfish...

100
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:54,544
...on the table behind the big davenport.

101
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:55,834
But to tell you the truth, Keyes...

102
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,793
I wasn't a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then.

103
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:02,670
Or in auto renewals, or in Mr.
Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.

104
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,469
I was thinking about that dame upstairs,
and the way she had looked at me...

105
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:09,147
...and I wanted to see her again, close...

106
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:12,902
...without that silly staircase between us.

107
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:19,223
I wasn't long, was I? (Walter)
- Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

108
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:22,621
Hope I've got my face on straight.
- It's perfect, for my money.

109
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,081
Neff is the name, isn't it?
- Yeah.

110
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:26,340
With two 'F's,' like in
Philadelphia, if you know the story.

111
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,008
What story?
The Philadelphia Story.

112
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,017
Suppose we sit down and you
tell me about the insurance.

113
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:33,496
My husband never tells me anything.

114
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:38,124
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

115
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:41,053
We've been handling this insurance
for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...

116
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:43,880
...and we'd hate to see the policies lapse.

117
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,719
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

118
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:50,208
As I was saying, we'd hate
to see the policies lapse.

119
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:52,967
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

120
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,446
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

121
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,604
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

122
00:09:57,704 --> 00:09:59,523
I suppose so. But he's
never home much before 8:00.

123
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:00,882
That's fine with me.

124
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,882
You're not connected with
the Automobile Club, are you?

125
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:05,261
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

126
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:08,159
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.

127
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,958
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.

128
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:12,037
No, he isn't.

129
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:15,156
Well, then he'd have to join the club
and pay the membership fee to start with.

130
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:17,794
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

131
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:21,673
The Automobile Club's fine. I can
do just as well for you, though.

132
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:23,832
I have a very attractive policy here.

133
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:26,471
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

134
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:28,989
For instance, we're writing a new
kind of 50% retention feature...

135
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:31,554
...in the collision coverage.

136
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:33,867
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

137
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,386
Well, I've been at it 11
years. Doing pretty well?

138
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:38,375
It's a living.

139
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,903
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

140
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:45,261
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

141
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,690
...industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

142
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,000
Accident insurance?

143
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,219
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

144
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,968
[Chuckles]

145
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:56,485
Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.

146
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:59,390
just my name.
- As, for instance?

147
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,504
Phyllis.
- Phyllis, huh?

148
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:05,472
I think I like that.
- But you're not sure?

149
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,570
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

150
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,269
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop
by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

151
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,128
He'll be in then.
- Who?

152
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:16,286
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

153
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:19,145
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

154
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,525
...if you know what I mean.

155
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,883
There's a speed limit in this
state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

156
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,271
How fast was I going, officer?
- I'd say around 90.

157
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:29,680
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

158
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,879
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

159
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,598
Suppose it doesn't take.

160
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:35,937
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

161
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:38,796
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

162
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:41,855
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

163
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:43,955
That tears it.

164
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:50,710
8:30 tomorrow evening then.
- That's what I suggested.

165
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,378
Will you be here, too?
- I guess so, I usually am.

166
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,648
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

167
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,553
I wonder if I know what you mean.

168
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,636
I wonder if you wonder.

169
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:06,263
(Walter) It was a hot afternoon
and I can still remember...

170
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:09,142
...the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.

171
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:13,280
How could I have known that murder
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?

172
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,498
Maybe you would have known, Keyes...

173
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:18,057
...the minute she mentioned
accident insurance, but I didn't.

174
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:20,157
I felt like a million.

175
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:23,843
I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.

176
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,933
It was the day you had that truck
driver from Inglewood on the carpet.

177
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,252
Remember, Keyes?

178
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:30,611
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see you.

179
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:32,510
He's been yelling for you all afternoon.

180
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,469
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

181
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:37,799
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

182
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:43,231
Hello, Walter.
- Hi, George.

183
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:45,803
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

184
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:47,683
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

185
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,722
You're in a jam and you know it.
- Says you.

186
00:12:49,822 --> 00:12:51,921
All I want is my money.
- Says you.

187
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,589
All you're gonna get is the cops.
- Hello, Walter.

188
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:57,638
This is Sam Garlopis from Inglewood.
- Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

189
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:00,516
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

190
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:05,304
I ain't so good. My truck burned down.
- Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

191
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:07,773
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

192
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:10,031
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

193
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:13,956
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

194
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,058
What little man?
- The little man in here.

195
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:20,087
Every time one of these phonies comes
along, it ties knots in my stomach.

196
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:21,527
I can't eat.

197
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:24,705
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's
how I knew your claim was crooked.

198
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,225
So what did I do?

199
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:28,784
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

200
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:30,662
...and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

201
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,181
And what did they find?

202
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:35,769
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

203
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:36,979
What shavings?

204
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,606
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

205
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:46,164
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor
guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

206
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:48,274
That's one way of putting it.

207
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,493
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

208
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:52,692
Here. Just a minute. Sign
this and you'll feel fine.

209
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:56,600
Sign what?
- It's a waiver on your claim. Right here.

210
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Here?
- Here.

211
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:04,486
Now you're an honest man
again. Goodbye, Garlopis.

212
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,425
But I ain't got no more truck.

213
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,804
$2,600 is lot of dough where I live.

214
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:11,243
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't
you know how to open the door?

215
00:14:11,343 --> 00:14:15,230
Just put your hand on the
knob, turn it to the left.

216
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,330
Now pull it toward you.

217
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:22,159
That's the boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

218
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,196
What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?

219
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:29,873
Are we an insurance company, or
just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

220
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:31,113
...to write a policy on a mug like that?

221
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:32,752
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

222
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:34,312
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

223
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:35,351
...to have him thoroughly investigated...

224
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:37,070
...before we accepted the risk.
- I know you did, Walter.

225
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,709
I'm not beefing at you. It's the
company. It's the way they do things.

226
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:40,829
The way they don't do things.

227
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,508
The way they'll write anything just
to get it down on the sales sheet.

228
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:45,967
And I'm the guy that has to sit
here up to my neck in phony claims...

229
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:48,845
...so they won't throw more money out the
window than they take in at the door.

230
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:50,664
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

231
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,942
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick
up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

232
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:55,622
...dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

233
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,501
...who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

234
00:14:57,601 --> 00:15:00,059
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting...

235
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,998
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

236
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:05,737
You love it, only you worry about it
too darn much, you and your little man.

237
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:08,056
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

238
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,735
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

239
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:13,293
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

240
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:14,713
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

241
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,451
...and find out if their calendar checked
with the World Almanac's calendar.

242
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:18,670
Now, that's enough from you, Walter.

243
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,020
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

244
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:25,068
[Flicking match]

245
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:27,168
I love you, too.

246
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,282
(Walter) I really did,
too, you old crab...

247
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:38,631
...always yelling your head off,
always sore at everybody.

248
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:42,220
But you never fooled me with your
song and dance. Not for a second.

249
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,659
I kind of always knew that behind
the cigar ashes on your vest...

250
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,466
...you had a heart as big as a house.

251
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:50,115
Back in my office there was a phone
message from Mrs. Dietrichson...

252
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,215
...about the renewals.

253
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:55,062
She didn't want me to come
tomorrow evening.

254
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,981
She wanted me to come Thursday
afternoon at 3:30 instead.

255
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:02,269
I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon...

256
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,209
...including a trip down to Santa Monica...

257
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:07,887
...to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance.

258
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:10,976
But I kept thinking
about Phyllis Dietrichson...

259
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:15,411
...and the way that anklet
of hers cut into her leg.

260
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:23,736
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

261
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:25,989
I'm considering it.

262
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,676
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

263
00:16:29,776 --> 00:16:32,595
Last night wasn't so
convenient. That's all right.

264
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:34,654
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

265
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:36,813
I was just fixing some iced
tea. Would you like a glass?

266
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,052
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle
of beer that's not working.

267
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:41,640
There may be some. I never
know what's in the icebox.

268
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
Nettie.

269
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:50,127
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

270
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:52,805
Oh, you did? Yes. He'll
renew with you, he told me so.

271
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,324
As a matter of fact, I thought
he'd be here this afternoon.

272
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:56,524
But he's not?
- No.

273
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:57,563
[Chuckles]

274
00:16:57,663 --> 00:16:59,663
That's terrible.

275
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:01,812
Nettie.

276
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,850
Oh, I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

277
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:08,738
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

278
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:11,388
Lemon? Sugar?
= ix it your way.

279
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:16,074
As long as it's the maid's day off,
maybe there's something I can do for you.

280
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:19,489
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.

281
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:21,931
I used to peddle vacuum cleaners.

282
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:23,850
Not much money, but you
learn a lot about life.

283
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,858
I didn't think you'd learned
it from a correspondence course.

284
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,067
Where'd you pick up this tea drinking?

285
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,266
You're not English, are you?
- No. Californian.

286
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,305
Born right here in Los Angeles.

287
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:39,400
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.

288
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,782
Mr. Neff, I...
- Make it Walter, huh?

289
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:43,882
Walter.
- That's right.

290
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,329
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

291
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:49,818
Twenty percent. Why?

292
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:52,417
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

293
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:54,976
I can always use it. I was
thinking about my husband.

294
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,354
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

295
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:59,614
t's very dangerous.
- Not for an executive, is it?

296
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,032
He doesn't just sit behind a desk.

297
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:03,291
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

298
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,531
It's got me worried sick.

299
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:06,850
You mean, some dark night a
crown block might fall on him?

300
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,289
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.

301
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,208
The other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman.

302
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,966
He's in the hospital with
a broken back. That's bad.

303
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,445
It's got me jittery just thinking about it.

304
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,644
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

305
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,744
It could.
Well...

306
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:26,751
...don't you think he ought to
have accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.

307
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,059
What kind of insurance could he have?

308
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,278
Enough to cover doctors and hospital bills.

309
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,317
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

310
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,676
And he'd rate around $50,000 capital sum.

311
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:39,584
Capital sum? What's that?
In case he gets killed.

312
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,953
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

313
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,292
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

314
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:45,691
Well, your husband would understand.

315
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,450
I'm sure I could sell him on the
idea of some accident protection.

316
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,029
Why don't I talk to him about it?

317
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,148
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

318
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,543
They're all tough at first.

319
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:56,186
He has a lot on his mind.

320
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,906
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

321
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,934
...except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

322
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:04,822
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

323
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:09,512
(Walter) Sounds pretty dull.
- So, I just sit and knit.

324
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:10,979
Is that what you married him for?

325
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:14,448
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

326
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,696
Anytime his thumbs get tired...

327
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:19,035
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

328
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:22,960
Wouldn't I?
- You bet your life, you wouldn't.

329
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:28,482
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

330
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,440
I want to ask you something, Walter.

331
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:37,367
Could I get an accident policy for
him without bothering him at all?

332
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,426
How's that, again?

333
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:41,345
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

334
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,884
I have a little allowance of my own.

335
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:47,744
I could pay for it and he
needn't know anything about it.

336
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:49,501
Why shouldn't he know?

337
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,880
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

338
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,718
He's superstitious about it. A lot
of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

339
00:19:55,818 --> 00:20:00,585
If there was a way to get it like
that, all the worry would be over.

340
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:03,634
See what I mean, Walter?
- Sure. I got good eyesight.

341
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:06,333
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

342
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:09,311
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

343
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:12,069
That's the setup, isn't it?
- Is there anything wrong with it?

344
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,390
No, I think it's lovely.

345
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,808
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him...

346
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:16,887
What crown block?

347
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:19,926
Only sometimes it can't quite make it
on its own, it has to have a little help.

348
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:21,265
I don't know what you're talking about.

349
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,705
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

350
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,743
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

351
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:27,823
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

352
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:30,558
Are you crazy?
- Not that crazy.

353
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,940
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
- What's the matter?

354
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:39,178
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

355
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:41,776
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

356
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,255
That's a horrible thing to say.

357
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:44,574
What'd you think I was, anyway?

358
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:46,893
A guy that walks into a good
looking dame's front parlor and says:

359
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:48,852
'Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

360
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:50,132
'You got one that's been around too long?

361
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,811
'One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

362
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,690
'Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect.'

363
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,268
Boy, what a dope you must think I am.
- I think you're rotten.

364
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:59,448
I think you're swell, so
long as I'm not your husband.

365
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:02,326
Get out of here.
- You bet I'll get out of here, baby.

366
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:05,061
I'll get out of here,
but quick.

367
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,400
(Walter) So I let her have
it straight between the eyes.

368
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,028
She didn't fool me
for a minute, not this time.

369
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,537
I knew I had hold of a red-hot poker...

370
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:23,826
...and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off.

371
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:27,673
I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of
beer, the one I had wanted all along...

372
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:31,432
...only I wanted it worse now, to get rid
of the sour taste of her iced tea...

373
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,351
...and everything that went with it.

374
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:36,469
I didn't want to go back to the office
so I dropped by a bowling alley...

375
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:38,948
...at Third and Western
and rolled a few lines...

376
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,736
...to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.

377
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:46,864
I didn't feel like eating dinner when
I left, and I didn't feel like a show.

378
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:51,891
So, I drove home, put the car
away and went up to my apartment.

379
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:54,261
It had begun to rain outside
and I watched it get dark...

380
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:56,610
...and didn't even turn on the light.

381
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,568
That didn't help me either.

382
00:21:58,668 --> 00:21:59,918
I was all twisted up inside...

383
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,966
...and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker.

384
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:06,765
And right then it came over me that I
hadn't walked out on anything at all.

385
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:09,094
That the hook was too strong...

386
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,682
...that this wasn't the end
between her and me.

387
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:13,292
It was only the beginning.

388
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:14,332
[Doorbell ringing]

389
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:16,464
So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd...

390
00:22:16,564 --> 00:22:18,799
...know who it was without
even having to think.

391
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,979
As if it was the most
natural thing in the world.

392
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:28,625
Hello. You forgot your hat this afternoon.

393
00:22:28,654 --> 00:22:31,793
Did I?
- Don't you want me to bring it in?

394
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,893
Sure.

395
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:36,691
Put it on the chair.

396
00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:47,785
How'd you know where I live?
- It's in the phone book.

397
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:49,885
It's raining.
- Yeah.

398
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:53,284
Peel off your coat and sit down.

399
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:56,330
Your husband out?

400
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,310
Yes. Long Beach. They're
spudding in a new well.

401
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,300
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

402
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:03,687
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

403
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:05,127
I knew you wouldn't leave it like that.

404
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:08,066
Like what?
- Like it was this afternoon.

405
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,303
I must have said something that
gave you a terribly wrong impression.

406
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:14,163
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

407
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:15,423
Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

408
00:23:15,523 --> 00:23:19,090
Not if you don't believe me.
- What do you want me to do?

409
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,570
I want you to be nice to me.

410
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:23,978
Like the first time you came to the house.

411
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:26,177
It can't be like the first time.

412
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:29,422
Something's happened.
- I know it has.

413
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:31,705
It's happened to us.

414
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:38,920
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

415
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,810
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

416
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,558
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

417
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:46,607
Maybe I oughtn't to have come.

418
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:49,246
Maybe you oughtn't.
- You want me to go?

419
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,525
If you want to.
- Right now?

420
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,625
Sure, right now.

421
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,387
[Walter sighing]...

422
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:11,704
I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you, Walter.

423
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:14,583
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

424
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:17,828
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

425
00:24:18,242 --> 00:24:20,291
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

426
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:24,216
The kind that bubbles.
- All I got is bourbon.

427
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:26,318
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

428
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:35,640
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

429
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,670
Club soda?
- Plain water, please.

430
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:48,457
You know, about six months ago a guy
slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

431
00:24:48,557 --> 00:24:51,126
...and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

432
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:53,095
Only he had accident insurance.

433
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:55,574
So they had an autopsy and
she didn't get away with it.

434
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:57,674
Who didn't?
- His wife.

435
00:24:59,702 --> 00:25:02,081
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

436
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:05,799
His wife said he was cleaning a
gun and his stomach got in the way.

437
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:09,477
All she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

438
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:12,212
Perhaps it was worth it to her.

439
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:18,031
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

440
00:25:19,892 --> 00:25:22,841
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

441
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:25,400
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

442
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,428
Cook your own breakfast?
- Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while.

443
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,297
Get the rest down at the corner drugstore.
- Sounds wonderful.

444
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,346
Just strangers beside you.

445
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:35,745
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

446
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:37,314
You don't have to sit across the table...

447
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:40,433
...and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

448
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:43,900
What daughter? You mean the
little girl on the piano?

449
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,671
Lola. She lives with us.

450
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:48,458
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

451
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:50,847
You ever think of a divorce?
- He wouldn't give me a divorce.

452
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:52,287
I suppose because it'd
cost him too much money.

453
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:54,826
He hasn't got any money. Not since
he went into the oil business.

454
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:56,974
But he had when you married him?

455
00:25:57,074 --> 00:26:00,993
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

456
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,280
But that's not the only
reason. I was his wife's nurse.

457
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,088
She was sick a long time. When she
died, he was terribly broken up.

458
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:12,287
I pitied him so.
- And now you hate him.

459
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:15,066
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.

460
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,934
Every time I buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off.

461
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,674
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

462
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,563
He's always been mean to me.

463
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:25,880
Even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his.

464
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,279
That Lola.
- Nothing for you at all?

465
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,598
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

466
00:26:31,698 --> 00:26:35,476
So you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas.

467
00:26:35,576 --> 00:26:38,555
Walter, I don't want to kill him. I never did.

468
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:42,480
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

469
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:46,800
Only sometimes you wish he was dead.
- Perhaps I do.

470
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,829
Then you wish it was an accident,
and you had that policy for $50,000.

471
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:53,564
Is that it?
- Perhaps that, too.

472
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,265
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

473
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:01,753
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

474
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,862
...and the motor still running.

475
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:08,100
And I thought what it would be
like if I didn't switch it off...

476
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,669
...just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

477
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:11,869
I'll tell you what it'd be like.

478
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:14,427
If you had that accident policy
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

479
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:16,507
We've got a guy in our office named Keyes.

480
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:19,465
For him a setup like that'd be just
like a slice of rare roast beef.

481
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:21,264
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

482
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:23,343
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

483
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:25,502
In a half-hour you'd be signing
your name to a confession.

484
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,322
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

485
00:27:27,422 --> 00:27:29,561
Not if there's an insurance
company in the picture, baby.

486
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:31,620
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

487
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,098
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

488
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:37,365
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

489
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:40,440
And I don't want you to hang, baby.

490
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:44,983
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

491
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,440
(Walter) So we just sat there.

492
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,599
She started crying softly, like the rain
on the window, and we didn't say anything.

493
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:56,558
Maybe she had stopped thinking
about it, but I hadn't.

494
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:57,607
I couldn't.

495
00:27:57,707 --> 00:28:00,985
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

496
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:04,513
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

497
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:06,911
Because you know how it is, Keyes.

498
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:08,122
In this business you can't sleep...

499
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,900
...for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you.

500
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,360
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

501
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,988
...watching the customers to make
sure they don't crook the house.

502
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:19,196
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

503
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:20,716
And do it smart.

504
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:22,795
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

505
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:25,063
You know every notch in it by heart.

506
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,822
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

507
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:30,302
A shill to put down the bet.

508
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:31,710
And suddenly the doorbell rings...

509
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:36,740
...and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you.

510
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,615
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

511
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:46,390
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

512
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:50,930
The stakes were $50,000, but
they were the life of a man, too.

513
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,929
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

514
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:57,928
...he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

515
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,028
And I did.

516
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:13,700
Will you phone me? Walter?

517
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:19,197
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

518
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:23,972
You believe me, don't you, Walter?
- Sure I believe you.

519
00:29:24,774 --> 00:29:27,764
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

520
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:30,062
They're not going to hang you, baby.

521
00:29:30,162 --> 00:29:31,641
It's better than going on this way.

522
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:32,802
They're not gonna hang you because...

523
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:34,600
...you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

524
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,259
Do you know what you're saying?
- Sure, I know what I'm saying.

525
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,758
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

526
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:41,837
And I'm the guy that knows how.
- Walter, you're hurting me.

527
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:44,776
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

528
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:46,876
It's got to be perfect.

529
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:00,967
Call me tomorrow. But not
from your house. From a booth.

530
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,826
And watch your step every single minute.

531
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,495
This has got to be perfect, you
understand? Straight down the line.

532
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:08,994
Straight down the line.

533
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:37,181
[Rain pattering]...

534
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,784
...[Car engine starts]...

535
00:30:43,497 --> 00:30:45,537
...[Car driving away]...

536
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,443
...(Walter) That was it, Keyes.

537
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:54,992
The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it.

538
00:30:55,092 --> 00:30:58,749
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

539
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:02,868
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

540
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:06,946
So I had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

541
00:31:07,046 --> 00:31:11,384
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

542
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:13,113
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

543
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:15,232
...because I wanted all the answers ready...

544
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:19,780
...for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

545
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,698
A couple of nights later I went to the house.

546
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,016
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

547
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:30,014
It was Dietrichson's daughter, Lola.

548
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:32,583
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

549
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:36,532
...to have her sitting right there in
the room, playing Chinese checkers...

550
00:31:36,632 --> 00:31:39,862
...as if nothing were going to happen.

551
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,580
(Walter) I suppose you
realize, Mr. Dietrichson...

552
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,879
...that, not being an employee...

553
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:45,158
...you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act.

554
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:48,376
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

555
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:49,575
Yeah, I know all about that.

556
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,055
The next thing you'll tell me I need...

557
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:54,493
...earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance.

558
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:56,213
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

559
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,012
...we'd stay broke paying
for it, wouldn't we, honey?

560
00:31:58,112 --> 00:32:01,789
What keeps us broke is you going
out and buying five hats at a crack.

561
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:03,489
Who needs a hat in California?

562
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,168
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

563
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:07,587
...accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy.

564
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:10,406
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

565
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:11,525
Just as you say.

566
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,284
Suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight.

567
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:15,673
Sure.

568
00:32:15,773 --> 00:32:19,071
All we'll need on that is for you
to sign the application for renewal.

569
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,880
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

570
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,240
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?

571
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,340
Yes, I have.

572
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:27,478
Father, is it all right if I run along now?

573
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,556
Run along where? Who with?
- Just Anne. We're going roller-skating.

574
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:32,315
Anne who?
- Anne Matthews.

575
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:34,274
It's not that Nino Zachetti again, is it?

576
00:32:34,374 --> 00:32:35,673
It better not be that Zachetti guy.

577
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:36,913
If I ever catch you with that...

578
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:38,312
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.

579
00:32:38,412 --> 00:32:40,391
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

580
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,429
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

581
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,848
...in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

582
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:48,457
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

583
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:50,706
Good night, Phyllis.
- Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

584
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:52,705
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.

585
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,805
Good night, Mr. Neff.

586
00:32:57,313 --> 00:33:00,411
A great little fighter for her weight.

587
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,520
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

588
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,899
Sign what?
- The applications for the auto renewals.

589
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,839
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

590
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:08,538
When will that be?
- About a week.

591
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:10,457
Just so I'm covered when I drive up north.

592
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:12,295
San Francisco?
- Palo Alto.

593
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:14,016
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.

594
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:16,415
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

595
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:19,892
What's wrong with that? Can't I
have a little fun, even once a year?

596
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:21,571
Great football school,
Stanford.

597
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:23,531
Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?
- Left guard.

598
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,170
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

599
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,270
The bottom line.

600
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:32,926
Both copies, please.
- Sign twice, huh?

601
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:34,245
Yes. One is the agent's copy.

602
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,935
I need it for my files.
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

603
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,020
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.

604
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,799
Don't worry about the check, I can
pick it up at your office some morning.

605
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:49,998
How much you taking me for?
- $147.50.

606
00:33:50,098 --> 00:33:52,677
I think that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.

607
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:54,777
Plenty.

608
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,332
Bring me some soda when
you come up, Phyllis.

609
00:33:59,432 --> 00:34:00,193
Good night, Mr. Neff.

610
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:01,232
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

611
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:05,412
I think you left your hat in the hall, Mr. Neff.

612
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:20,714
Good night, Mr. Neff.

613
00:34:22,992 --> 00:34:24,102
All right, Walter?
- Fine.

614
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:26,001
He signed it, didn't he?
- Sure he signed it. You saw him.

615
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:27,920
Now, listen. That trip to
Palo Alto. When does he leave?

616
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,940
End of the month.

617
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,979
He drives, huh?
- He always drives.

618
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,618
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

619
00:34:31,718 --> 00:34:33,177
Why?
- Because it's all worked out for a train.

620
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:35,496
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

621
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:37,375
...a little thing called double indemnity.

622
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,214
The insurance companies put it in as
a sort of come-on for the customers.

623
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:42,353
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

624
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:43,972
The kind that almost never happen.

625
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:46,450
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

626
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,849
...they pay $100,000 instead of $50,000.

627
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,248
I see.
- We're hitting it for the limit, baby.

628
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:54,408
That's why it's got to be the train.

629
00:34:55,017 --> 00:34:57,726
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

630
00:34:57,826 --> 00:34:59,826
Straight down the line.

631
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:20,205
(Lola) Hello, Mr. Neff.

632
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,863
It's me.

633
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:25,232
Is anything wrong?
- I've been waiting for you.

634
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:26,352
For me? Why?

635
00:35:26,452 --> 00:35:31,892
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

636
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:37,826
Which way would that be?
- Down the hill. Down Vermont.

637
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:40,785
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

638
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:43,350
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

639
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:48,331
Going roller-skating, huh?

640
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:52,688
You like roller-skating?
- I can take it or leave it.

641
00:35:52,788 --> 00:35:56,443
Only tonight you're leaving it?
- Yes, I am.

642
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:59,415
I'm having a very tough time at home.

643
00:35:59,515 --> 00:36:03,044
My father doesn't understand
me and Phyllis hates me.

644
00:36:03,144 --> 00:36:06,492
Sounds tough, all right.
- That's why I have to lie sometimes.

645
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:07,912
You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin?

646
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:09,831
It's Vermont and Franklin all right.

647
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:13,926
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

648
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:15,929
You won't tell on me,
will you?

649
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:18,606
I'd have to think it over.
- Nino's not what my father says at all.

650
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:21,645
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

651
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:24,564
...and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

652
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:27,232
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

653
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:32,177
Then he lost his job for
talking back. He's so hot-headed.

654
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,519
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

655
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:35,958
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

656
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:38,197
...except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

657
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:42,292
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

658
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,314
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

659
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:51,109
I suppose it will sometime. This
is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

660
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,400
(Lola) Nino? Over here, Nino.

661
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:05,294
This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
- Hello, Nino.

662
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:06,784
The name is Zachetti.

663
00:37:06,884 --> 00:37:09,422
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave
me a ride from the house.

664
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:10,542
I told him all about us.

665
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:11,901
Why does he have to get told about us?

666
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:13,901
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

667
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,460
I'm not doing any worrying.

668
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,778
Just don't you broadcast so much.

669
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:18,498
Well, what's the matter with you, Nino?

670
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:20,977
Why, he's a friend.
- I don't have any friends.

671
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:23,216
If I did, I like to pick them myself.
= Come on.

672
00:37:23,316 --> 00:37:25,515
Look, sonny, she needed a
ride, so I brought her along.

673
00:37:25,615 --> 00:37:27,654
Is that anything to get tough about?

674
00:37:27,754 --> 00:37:30,093
All right, Lola, make up your
mind. Are you coming or aren't you?

675
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:32,193
Of course I'm coming.

676
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,489
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

677
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,884
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

678
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,754
(Walter) She was a nice kid.

679
00:37:46,854 --> 00:37:49,703
Maybe he was a little better
than he sounded.

680
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:53,061
But right then it gave me a nasty feeling
to be thinking about them at all...

681
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:56,680
...with that briefcase right behind my head
that had her father's signature in it...

682
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,799
...and what that signature meant.

683
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:01,147
It meant he was a dead pigeon.

684
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:04,956
It was only a question of time,
and not very much time at that.

685
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:08,303
You know that big market
up on Los Feliz, Keyes?

686
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:11,793
That's the place Phyllis and I
had picked for a meeting place.

687
00:38:11,893 --> 00:38:13,871
I already had most of the plan in my head...

688
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:16,130
...but a lot of details had to be worked out.

689
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,938
And she had to know them all
by heart when the time came.

690
00:38:20,038 --> 00:38:22,577
We had to be very careful from now on.

691
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:25,186
We couldn't let anybody see us together.

692
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:28,025
We couldn't even talk to
each other on the telephone.

693
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:31,454
Not from her house or at my office, anyway.

694
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:35,811
So she was to be in the market every
morning about 11:00, buying stuff.

695
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:39,179
And I could sort of run into
her there any day I wanted to.

696
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:41,999
Sort of accidentally on purpose.

697
00:38:42,307 --> 00:38:45,367
Walter, I wanted to...
- Not so loud.

698
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:47,695
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

699
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:49,814
Let me talk first.
It's all set.

700
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:52,293
The accident policy came
through. I've got it in my pocket.

701
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:55,172
I got his check, too. I saw
him down in the oil fields.

702
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:57,291
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

703
00:38:57,391 --> 00:39:00,089
The check's just made out to the
company, so it could be for anything.

704
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:02,848
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

705
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:05,846
Itll be all right that way, because
one of the cars is in your name.

706
00:39:05,946 --> 00:39:07,946
Open your bag. Quick.

Can you get in the safe-deposit box?

709
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:15,882
Yes. We both have keys.
- Fine.

710
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:18,160
But don't put the policy in
there yet. I'll tell you when.

711
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,859
Remember, you never saw it, you
never even touched it, you understand?

712
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,418
I'm not a fool. Okay.
- When is he leaving on the train?

713
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:24,898
That's just it. He isn't going.
- What?

714
00:39:24,998 --> 00:39:26,777
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. The trip is off.

715
00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:28,877
What happened?

716
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:32,753
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

717
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:34,853
That one up there?

718
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:41,506
I don't know why they always
put what I want on the top shelf.

719
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,808
Go ahead. I'm listening.

720
00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:45,148
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

721
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:47,856
Broke his leg?
What do we do now, Walter?

722
00:39:47,956 --> 00:39:50,425
Nothing. We just wait.
- Wait for what?

723
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:51,904
Until he can take the train.

724
00:39:52,004 --> 00:39:53,144
I told you it's got to be the train.

725
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:54,503
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick, just to get it over with.

727
00:39:57,522 --> 00:40:00,141
There are other ways.
- We're not gonna do it other ways.

728
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:01,260
But we can't leave it like this.

729
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,158
What do you suppose would happen if
he found out about the accident policy?

730
00:40:04,258 --> 00:40:06,198
Plenty. But not as bad as
sitting in that death house.

731

Don't ever talk like that. Don't let's

00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:59,222
Then it was the 15th of June.
You may remember that date, Keyes.

746
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:03,061
You came into my office
around 3:00 in the afternoon.

747
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:04,370
Hello, Keyes.

748
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,629
I just came from Norton's office.

749
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,108
The semiannual sales records are out.

750
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,967
You're high man, Walter. That's
twice in a row. Congratulations.

751
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,626
Thanks.
- How would you like a cheap drink?

752
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:15,105
How would you like a $50 cut in salary?

753
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:17,343
Do I laugh now or wait till it gets funny?
- No, I'm serious.

754
00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:20,562
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

755
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:21,901
Too much pressure on my nerves.

756
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,920
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

757
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,820
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

758
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,219
Me? Why pick on me?

759
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,698
Well, because I've got a crazy
idea you might be good at the job.

760
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:31,117
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

761
00:41:31,217 --> 00:41:34,725
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

762
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,014
You're too good to be a salesman.

763
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:38,134
Nobody's too good to be a salesman.
- Phooey.

764
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:41,532
All you guys do is just ring doorbells
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

765
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,691
What's troubling you is that $50 cut, isn't it?

766
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,231
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter.

767
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:48,148
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

768
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:50,028
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

769
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:51,187
It's the hottest job in the business.

770
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:52,427
Yeah, but it's still a desk job.

771
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:54,546
I don't want to be nailed to a desk.
- Desk job?

772
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,125
Is that all you can see in it?

773
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:59,064
Just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

774
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:01,743
Just a pile of papers to shuffle
around, and five sharp pencils...

775
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:06,000
...and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

776
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,999
Well, that's not the way I look at it, Walter.

777
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:12,018
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

778
00:42:12,118 --> 00:42:14,796
...and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

779
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:18,514
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

780
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:21,703
They're alive.
They're packed with drama...

781
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:23,872
...with twisted hopes and crooked dreams.

782
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:27,050
A claims man, Walter, is a
doctor and a bloodhound and a...

783
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,150
...[telephone ringing]

784
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:31,658
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

785
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,746
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound
and a cop and a judge and a jury...

786
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:36,426
...and a father confessor,
all in one.

787
00:42:36,526 --> 00:42:37,985
And you want to tell me
you're not interested?

788
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:39,184
You don't want to work with your brains?

789
00:42:39,284 --> 00:42:41,224
All you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell...

790
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:44,682
...for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.

791
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:47,181
Walter Neff speaking.
- I had to call you, Walter.

792
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:49,929
It's very urgent.
Are you with somebody?

793
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:53,429
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?

794
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:56,736
No, you can't. I've only
got a minute. It can't wait.

795
00:42:56,836 --> 00:42:59,975
Listen. He's going tonight. On
the train. Are you listening?

796
00:43:00,075 --> 00:43:03,220
Walter?
- Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

797
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:05,651
Only, make it snappy, will you?
- He's on crutches.

798
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:08,910
The doctor says he can go if he's
careful. The change will do him good.

799
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,629
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the
way you wanted it, on a train.

800
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:14,167
Only with the crutches it makes
it much better, doesn't it?

801
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:16,817
Yeah. Yeah,
that's 100% better.

802
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,325
Hold the line a minute,
will you?

803
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:22,024
Keyes, suppose I join you in your office?
- That's all right. I'll wait.

804
00:43:22,124 --> 00:43:25,014
Only tell her not to take all day.

805
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:27,431
Go ahead.

806
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:30,479
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

807
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,298
It's still the same dark street, isn't it?

808
00:43:32,398 --> 00:43:36,147
And the signal is three honks on the horn.
- Okay. Anything else?

809
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:37,385
No.

810
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:38,906
Oh, uh...

811
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:40,515
...what color did you pick?

812
00:43:40,615 --> 00:43:43,984
Blue. Navy blue. And the
cast is on his left leg.

813
00:43:44,084 --> 00:43:45,662
Mmm-hmm.

814
00:43:45,762 --> 00:43:47,191
Yeah, that suits me fine.

815
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,450
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

816
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,429
But it's straight down
the line for both of us.

817
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,909
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

818
00:43:56,557 --> 00:43:58,347
Sorry, Keyes.
- What's the matter?

819
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:01,026
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

820
00:44:01,126 --> 00:44:02,975
If I told you it was a customer...

821
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:05,023
Margie. I bet she drinks from the bottle.

822
00:44:05,123 --> 00:44:06,882
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

823
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:10,861
Why don't you, for instance?
- I almost did, once. Long time ago.

824
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:12,619
Now look, Keyes, I've
got to call on a prospect.

825
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:15,099
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

826
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,317
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

827
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:20,096
I was on my way to the
jewelry store to buy the ring.

828
00:44:20,196 --> 00:44:22,655
And then suddenly that little
man in here started working on me.

829
00:44:22,755 --> 00:44:24,194
So you went back
and had her investigated?

830
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,354
Yeah. And the stuff that came out...

831
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:29,791
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

832
00:44:29,891 --> 00:44:32,290
There was a manic depressive in
her family, on her mother's side.

833
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,929
She already had one husband.

834
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:36,008
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

835
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:38,047
And as for her brother...
- I get the general idea.

836
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:41,605
She was a tramp from a long line of tramps.
- Yeah. All right, all right.

837
00:44:41,705 --> 00:44:44,285
Now what do I say to Norton? What
about this job I want you for?

838
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:45,843
I don't think I want it, Keyes.

839
00:44:45,943 --> 00:44:48,918
Thanks just the same.
- Fair enough.

840
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:51,361
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

841
00:44:51,461 --> 00:44:53,520
...not because I think
you're so darn smart...

842
00:44:53,620 --> 00:45:00,335
...but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

843
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:06,663
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

844
00:45:06,763 --> 00:45:09,143
You're just a little taller.

845
00:45:19,277 --> 00:45:20,587
(Walter) Yes, Keyes.

846
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:24,105
Those Fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.

847
00:45:24,205 --> 00:45:27,413
Now they had thrown the
switch. The gears had meshed.

848
00:45:27,513 --> 00:45:30,743
The time for thinking had all run out.

849
00:45:30,752 --> 00:45:34,301
I wanted my movements accounted
for up to the last possible moment.

850
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:38,338
So when I left the office I put my rate
book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.

851
00:45:38,438 --> 00:45:40,648
That was part of my alibi.

852
00:45:41,746 --> 00:45:44,335
From here on, it was a question
of following the timetable...

853
00:45:44,435 --> 00:45:46,435
...move by move.

854
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:50,133
I got home about 7:00 and
drove right into the garage.

855
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:53,973
This was another item to establish my alibi.

856
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,530
Hi, Mr. Neff.
- Hello, Charlie.

857
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,369
How about giving the heap a wash job?

858
00:45:58,469 --> 00:45:59,549
How soon you gonna want it?

859
00:45:59,649 --> 00:46:00,968
I got a couple cars ahead of you.

860
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:02,487
Any time you get to it, Charlie.

861
00:46:02,587 --> 00:46:04,716
I'm staying in tonight.
- Okay.

862
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:06,685
(Walter) Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...

863
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:08,964
...one of the salesmen
that shared my office.

864
00:46:09,064 --> 00:46:12,282
He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll
call and there'd be a record of it.

865
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:14,561
I told him I'd forgotten my
rate book and needed some dope...

866
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:17,469
...on the public liability bond I was figuring.

867
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:21,178
I changed into a navy blue suit
like Dietrichson was going to wear.

868
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,217
Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures.

869
00:46:24,317 --> 00:46:26,616
I stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets...

870
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:30,514
...so I could fake something that
looked like a cast on a broken leg.

871
00:46:30,614 --> 00:46:32,553
Next, I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...

872
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:35,311
...so that it would fall down if the bell rang.

873
00:46:35,411 --> 00:46:38,750
That way I'd know if anybody
had called me while I was away.

874
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:43,257
Then I did the same thing to the
doorbell in case anybody came to see me.

875
00:46:43,357 --> 00:46:47,695
I left the apartment by the
service stairs. Nobody saw me.

876
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:50,904
I walked all the way from my
apartment to the Dietrichson house.

877
00:46:51,004 --> 00:46:52,283
I didn't want to take the bus...

878
00:46:52,383 --> 00:46:54,215
...because there was
always the chance that...

879
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:55,861
...someone might remember
seeing me on it.

880
00:46:55,961 --> 00:46:58,086
I was being that careful.

881
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,739
I could smell that honeysuckle again.

882
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:04,919
Only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.

883
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:11,404
I slid the garage door open
as quietly as I could.

884
00:47:11,504 --> 00:47:14,413
She'd backed the sedan in,
just the way I told her to.

885
00:47:14,513 --> 00:47:15,931
I'd figured it was safer that way...

886
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:18,930
...in case he got into the car
before she drove it out.

887
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,209
I got into the back of the car.

888
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:23,648
I lay there on the floor and waited.

889
00:47:23,748 --> 00:47:26,687
All the time I was thinking about that
dark street on the way to the station...

890
00:47:26,787 --> 00:47:28,465
...where I was to do it...

891
00:47:28,565 --> 00:47:31,184
...and the three honks on the
horn that were to be the signal.

892
00:47:31,284 --> 00:47:33,563
About 10 minutes later they came down.

893
00:47:33,663 --> 00:47:35,282
All right, honey?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

894
00:47:35,382 --> 00:47:38,272
I'll have the car out in a second.

895
00:47:54,843 --> 00:47:56,843
[Inaudible]...

896
00:48:12,995 --> 00:48:17,330
Take it easy, honey. We've got lots of time.
- Yeah.

897
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:36,733
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

898
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,452
...you might end up with a shorter leg.

899
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:42,440
So what? I could break the other
one and match them up again.

900
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,909
It makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

901
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:49,939
It's only for four days. I'll
be back Monday at the latest.

902
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:08,305
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

903
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:10,837
[Honking]

904
00:49:10,937 --> 00:49:13,317
What are you doing that for?

905
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:16,503
What are you honking the horn for?

906
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:18,643
[Dietrichson choking]...

907

...[Train horn blowing]...

...[Bell ringing]

909
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,886
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

910
00:50:15,986 --> 00:50:18,185
Don't worry.
- Keep away from me as much as you can.

911
00:50:18,285 --> 00:50:20,623
Tell them I don't want to be helped.
- I said, don't worry, Walter.

912
00:50:20,723 --> 00:50:22,822
You start as soon as the train leaves.

913
00:50:22,922 --> 00:50:25,441
When you get to the refinery, turn
off the highway onto the dirt road.

914
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:27,000
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

915
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,460
...to the dump beside the tracks.
- Remember.

916
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,620
I remember everything.
- No speeding.

917
00:50:32,247 --> 00:50:34,836
You don't want any cops stopping
you with him in the back.

918
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:37,155
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

919
00:50:37,255 --> 00:50:39,423
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

920
00:50:39,523 --> 00:50:41,513
I'll be back on the observation platform.

921
00:50:41,613 --> 00:50:44,132
I'll drop off as close to the spot as I can.

922
00:50:44,232 --> 00:50:48,142
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

923
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,388
San Francisco train, lady?
- Car 9, section 11. Just my husband.

924
00:50:52,488 --> 00:50:55,378
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.

925
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:04,462
Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

926
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,562
Car number 8. Up there.

927
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:14,867
Car 9, section 11.
- Thank you.

928
00:51:17,386 --> 00:51:19,655
Here're the tickets. Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

929
00:51:19,755 --> 00:51:21,034
Yeah.
- You take it easy driving home.

930
00:51:21,134 --> 00:51:24,449
I'll miss you, honey.
- Section 11, sir.

931
00:51:26,222 --> 00:51:28,011
(Porter) All aboard.
- Thank you.

932
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:30,491
Goodbye, honey.
- All aboard.

933
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,380
[Train whistle blowing]

934
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:37,737
Good luck, honey.

935
00:51:45,573 --> 00:51:47,082
Porter, will you make up
my berth right away?

936
00:51:47,182 --> 00:51:48,162
Yes, sir.

937
00:51:48,262 --> 00:51:49,840
I'm going back to the
observation car for a smoke.

938
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,940
Right this way, sir.

939
00:52:16,677 --> 00:52:18,887
[Train whistle blowing]...

940
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:24,325
...(Jackson) Like a chair?

941
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:28,431
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

942
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:33,029
You going far?
- Palo Alto.

943
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:34,859
My name's Jackson.

944
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:38,327
I'm going all the way
to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

945
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:40,467
I had a broken arm once.

946
00:52:40,826 --> 00:52:43,975
That darn cast itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

947
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:46,274
I thought I'd go crazy with mine.

948
00:52:46,374 --> 00:52:50,624
Palo Alto's a nice little
town. You a Stanford man?

949
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:55,271
I used to be.
- I'll bet you left something behind.

950
00:52:55,779 --> 00:52:57,197
I always do.

951
00:52:57,297 --> 00:53:00,506
My cigar case. I guess I left it
in my overcoat back in the section.

952
00:53:00,606 --> 00:53:03,766
Would you care to roll
yourself a cigarette, Mister...

953
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:05,194
Dietrichson.

954
00:53:05,294 --> 00:53:08,184
No thanks,
I really prefer a cigar.

955
00:53:08,373 --> 00:53:11,422
Maybe the porter could... Well,
I could get your cigars for you.

956
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,720
Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
- If it's not too much trouble.

957
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:19,325
Car 9, section 11.
- Car 9, section 11. With pleasure.

958
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:02,377
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

959
00:54:02,477 --> 00:54:07,492
Here, take his hat. Pick up
the crutches back on the tracks.

960
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:35,892
Okay, baby. That's it.

961
00:54:51,003 --> 00:54:53,003
[Engine faltering]...

00:55:20,629 --> 00:55:22,629

964
00:55:31,624 --> 00:55:33,624
All right. Let's go.

965
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:44,528
(Walter) On the way back,
we went over once more...

966
00:55:44,628 --> 00:55:45,968
...what she was to do at the inquest...

967
00:55:46,068 --> 00:55:49,675
...if they had one, and about the
insurance, when that came up.

968
00:55:49,775 --> 00:55:52,684
I was afraid she might go to pieces
a little, now that we had done it.

969
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:58,032
But she was perfect. No nerves. Not
a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.

970
00:55:58,132 --> 00:56:01,749
She dropped me a block
from my apartment house.

971
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:06,609
Walter, what's the matter?
- Aren't you going to kiss me?

972
00:56:09,886 --> 00:56:13,031
It's straight down the line,
isn't it?

973
00:56:16,963 --> 00:56:20,281
I love you, Walter.
- I love you, baby.

974
00:56:32,914 --> 00:56:36,503
It was two minutes past 11:00, as
I went up the service stairs again.

975
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:40,381
Nobody saw me this time either. In
the apartment I checked the bells.

976
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:44,306
The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.

977
00:56:44,788 --> 00:56:49,447
Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.

978
00:56:49,547 --> 00:56:54,987
I had to go down to the garage.
I wanted Charlie to see me again.

979
00:56:59,782 --> 00:57:02,531
You gonna use your car, after all?
- I'm not quite through.

980
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:04,389
Well, that's all right,
Charlie.

981
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,469
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

982
00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:09,387
Been working upstairs all night. My
stomach's getting a little sore at me.

983
00:57:09,487 --> 00:57:11,487
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

984
00:57:12,855 --> 00:57:14,765
That was all there was to it.

985
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:17,383
Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.

986
00:57:17,483 --> 00:57:19,762
There was nothing to give us away.

987
00:57:19,862 --> 00:57:23,301
And yet, Keyes, as I was walking
down the street to the drugstore...

988
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:26,659
...suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong.

989
00:57:26,759 --> 00:57:29,868
It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.

990
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:32,773
I couldn't hear my own footsteps.

991
00:57:35,325 --> 00:57:37,875
It was the walk of a dead man.

992
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,489
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes...

993
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,267
...and the next day was worse, when
the story had broke in the papers...

994
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,146
...and they started talking
about it at the office...

995
00:57:53,246 --> 00:57:56,325
...and the day after that, when
you started digging into it.

996
00:57:56,425 --> 00:58:00,163
I kept my hands in my pockets
because I thought they were shaking.

997
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:02,381
I put on dark glasses so
people couldn't see my eyes.

998
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:06,240
And then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

999
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,129
I tried to hold myself together, but...

1000
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:12,969
I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces.

1001
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:17,464
Oh, Walter?
- Hello, Keyes.

1002
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:19,773
Come along. The big boss wants to see us.

1003
00:58:19,873 --> 00:58:22,122
The Dietrichson case?
- Must be.

1004
00:58:22,222 --> 00:58:24,092
Anything wrong?
- Well, the guy is dead.

1005
00:58:24,192 --> 00:58:27,910
We had him insured and it's gonna
cost us dough. That's always wrong.

1006
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,148
What have they got so far?
- Autopsy report.

1007
00:58:30,248 --> 00:58:33,687
No heart failure, no apoplexy, no
predisposing medical cause of any kind.

1008
00:58:33,787 --> 00:58:35,596
Died of a broken neck.

1009
00:58:35,696 --> 00:58:37,645
When's the inquest?
- Had it this morning.

1010
00:58:37,745 --> 00:58:39,684
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

1011
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:42,443
The train people and some of the
passengers told how he went through...

1012
00:58:42,543 --> 00:58:43,722
...to the observation car.

1013
00:58:43,822 --> 00:58:48,582
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

1014
00:58:48,769 --> 00:58:50,139
What do the police figure?

1015
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,758
That he got tangled up in his
crutches and fell off the train.

1016
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:54,397
They're satisfied.

1017
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:57,812
It's not their dough.
- Come on, Walter.

1018
00:58:58,405 --> 00:59:00,225
(Norton) All right. Thank
you very much, gentlemen.

1019
00:59:00,325 --> 00:59:02,393
I believe the legal position is now clear.

1020
00:59:02,493 --> 00:59:04,712
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

1021
00:59:04,812 --> 00:59:08,042
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.

1022
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:13,887
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

1023
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:16,826
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I
didn't know this was formal.

1024
00:59:16,926 --> 00:59:18,206
Sit down, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1025
00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:19,265
Any new developments?

1026
00:59:19,365 --> 00:59:21,864
I just talked to this Jackson long
distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

1027
00:59:21,964 --> 00:59:22,903
Who's Jackson?

1028
00:59:23,003 --> 00:59:24,443
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

1029
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,982
They were out on the observation
platform together, talking.

1030
00:59:27,082 --> 00:59:29,021
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

1031
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:30,680
...to get Dietrichson's cigar case for him.

1032
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,018
When he returned to the observation
platform, no Dietrichson.

1033
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:34,878
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

1034
00:59:34,978 --> 00:59:36,817
...a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

1035
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:39,515
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

1036
00:59:39,615 --> 00:59:41,974
Very interesting about the cigar case.

1037
00:59:42,074 --> 00:59:43,974
Anything else?
No, not much.

1038
00:59:44,074 --> 00:59:46,891
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

1039
00:59:46,991 --> 00:59:50,211
There's a daughter, but all she
remembers is Neff talking to her father...

1040
00:59:50,311 --> 00:59:52,409
...about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1041
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:53,789
I couldn't sell him at first.

1042
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:56,667
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1043
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:59,806
Later I saw him in the
oil fields and closed him.

1044
00:59:59,906 --> 01:00:01,804
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1045
01:00:01,904 --> 01:00:04,183
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1046
01:00:04,283 --> 01:00:05,803
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1047
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:07,762
He's got the best sales record in the office.

1048
01:00:07,862 --> 01:00:10,960
Are your salesmen supposed to know a
customer is going to fall off the train?

1049
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:14,948
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1050
01:00:15,048 --> 01:00:17,237
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1051
01:00:17,337 --> 01:00:18,756
Then what do you think of this case?

1052
01:00:18,856 --> 01:00:20,515
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1053
01:00:20,615 --> 01:00:22,615
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1054
01:00:22,715 --> 01:00:24,374
Just what is your opinion?

1055
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:26,113
No opinion at all.
- Not even a hunch?

1056
01:00:26,213 --> 01:00:28,432
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1057
01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:29,792
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1058
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:33,389
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've
formed a very definite opinion.

1059
01:00:33,489 --> 01:00:36,988
I think I know. In fact, I know I
know what happened to Dietrichson.

1060
01:00:37,088 --> 01:00:41,763
You know you know what?
- I know it was not an accident.

1061
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,994
What do you say to that?
- Me?

1062
01:00:47,312 --> 01:00:49,581
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1063
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:53,060
There's a widespread feeling that just
because a man has a large office...

1064
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,160
...[intercom buzzing]

1065
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:58,628
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1066
01:00:59,148 --> 01:01:00,617
There's a widespread feeling that...

1067
01:01:00,717 --> 01:01:03,855
...just because a man has a large
office, he must be an idiot.

1068
01:01:03,955 --> 01:01:05,774
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

1069
01:01:05,874 --> 01:01:08,693
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1070
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:10,793
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1071
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,648
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1072
01:01:16,748 --> 01:01:19,367
I assure you I appreciate
it. This is Mr. Keyes.

1073
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,847
How do you do?
- How do you do?

1074
01:01:20,947 --> 01:01:22,866
And Mr. Neff. I've met
Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1075
01:01:22,966 --> 01:01:26,026
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Won't you sit down?

1076
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:29,683
(Norton) May I extend our
sympathy in your bereavement?

1077
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:32,142
I hesitated before asking you to
come here so soon after your loss.

1078
01:01:32,242 --> 01:01:35,719
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

1079
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:37,279
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

1080
01:01:37,379 --> 01:01:39,858
No. All I know is that your
secretary made it sound very urgent.

1081
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,957
Your husband had an accident
policy with this company.

1082
01:01:42,057 --> 01:01:43,676
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1083
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:46,355
No. I remember some talk at the
house, but he didn't seem to want it.

1084
01:01:46,455 --> 01:01:49,593
Your husband took the policy out
a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1085
01:01:49,693 --> 01:01:52,032
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1086
01:01:52,132 --> 01:01:53,811
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

1087
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:55,790
It seems a tax examiner has to be present.

1088
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,489
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1089
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:58,929
...you're being subjected
to any questioning...

1090
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:00,548
...but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1091
01:02:00,648 --> 01:02:01,938
What sort of things?

1092
01:02:02,038 --> 01:02:04,066
We have the report of the coroner's inquest.

1093
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:07,085
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1094
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:10,245
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

1095
01:02:11,513 --> 01:02:14,828
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

1096
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,230
...a suicide.

1097
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:24,209
I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water?
- Please.

1098
01:02:27,585 --> 01:02:29,585
Thank you.

1099
01:02:34,581 --> 01:02:38,010
Had your husband been depressed
or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1100
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,729
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

1101
01:02:40,829 --> 01:02:43,987
He was perfectly all right and I
don't know of any financial worries.

1102
01:02:44,087 --> 01:02:46,086
Let us examine this so-called accident.

1103
01:02:46,186 --> 01:02:50,154
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1104
01:02:50,254 --> 01:02:53,063
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1105
01:02:53,163 --> 01:02:55,681
Do what?
- Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone.

1106
01:02:55,781 --> 01:02:59,200
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

1107
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,947
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

1108
01:03:03,047 --> 01:03:05,996
Once there, he finds he is not
alone. There is a man there.

1109
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:10,025
What was his name, Keyes?
- His name was Jackson. Probably still is.

1110
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:13,673
So he gets rid of this Jackson with
some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1111
01:03:13,773 --> 01:03:16,911
And then he is alone. And then he does it.
- Does what?

1112
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:20,779
He jumps. Suicide. In which
case, the company is not liable.

1113
01:03:20,879 --> 01:03:23,628
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

1114
01:03:23,728 --> 01:03:27,455
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1115
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:30,704
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1116
01:03:30,804 --> 01:03:33,543
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1117
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,982
A settlement for a certain
sum, a part of the policy value.

1118
01:03:36,082 --> 01:03:37,802
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in...

1119
01:03:37,902 --> 01:03:39,580
...here, I had no idea
you owed me any money.

1120
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,619
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1121
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:44,018
Now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it, whatever it is.

1122
01:03:44,118 --> 01:03:46,318
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1123
01:03:46,418 --> 01:03:49,615
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

1124
01:03:49,715 --> 01:03:54,560
In fact, I don't like you,
Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

1125
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:57,801
[Door slamming]...

1126
01:03:57,901 --> 01:04:01,010
...(Keyes) Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1127
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:02,370
Only you fumbled on the goal line.

1128
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:05,508
Then you heaved an illegal forward
pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1129
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:08,386
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1130
01:04:08,486 --> 01:04:11,365
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

1131
01:04:11,465 --> 01:04:12,865
Oh, can we?

1132
01:04:12,965 --> 01:04:16,603
Mr. Norton, the first thing that
struck me was that suicide angle.

1133
01:04:16,703 --> 01:04:20,261
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

1134
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:23,759
You know, you ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1135
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:26,178
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1136
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:28,277
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1137
01:04:28,377 --> 01:04:30,056
Yeah, in the front office.

1138
01:04:30,156 --> 01:04:33,154
Come now, you've never read an
actuarial table in your life, have you?

1139
01:04:33,254 --> 01:04:35,394
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

1140
01:04:35,494 --> 01:04:37,193
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

1141
01:04:37,293 --> 01:04:39,152
...by sex, by seasons of
the year, by time of day.

1142
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:42,470
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1143
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:45,089
Suicide by poison, subdivided
by types of poison...

1144
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:47,667
...such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1145
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:49,147
...alkaloid, protein,
and so forth.

1146
01:04:49,247 --> 01:04:51,806
Suicide by leaps, subdivided
by leaps from high places...

1147
01:04:51,906 --> 01:04:53,905
...under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1148
01:04:54,005 --> 01:04:57,253
...under the feet of horses, from
steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1149
01:04:57,353 --> 01:05:00,742
...of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

1150
01:05:00,842 --> 01:05:02,100
...from the rear end of a moving train.

1151
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,860
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1152
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,778
...at the point where the body
was found? 15 miles an hour.

1153
01:05:06,878 --> 01:05:08,937
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1154
01:05:09,037 --> 01:05:11,736
...with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1155
01:05:11,836 --> 01:05:13,436
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1156
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:16,494
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1157
01:05:16,594 --> 01:05:18,594
May I have this?

1158
01:05:21,301 --> 01:05:23,301
Come on, Walter.

1159
01:05:25,859 --> 01:05:28,324
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1160
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:46,039
(Walter) I could have hugged you
right then and there, Keyes...

1161
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:47,599
...you and your statistics.

1162
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:50,297
You were the only one
we were really scared of...

1163
01:05:50,397 --> 01:05:53,106
...and instead you were
almost playing on our team.

1164
01:05:53,206 --> 01:05:56,075
That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.

1165
01:05:56,175 --> 01:05:58,114
I could feel the ground under my feet again.

1166
01:05:58,214 --> 01:06:00,873
And it looked like easy going
from there on in.

1167
01:06:00,973 --> 01:06:03,111
That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...

1168
01:06:03,211 --> 01:06:05,710
...as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.

1170

Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1171
01:06:16,914 --> 01:06:18,384
You were wonderful in Norton's office.

1172
01:06:18,484 --> 01:06:21,562
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1173
01:06:21,662 --> 01:06:24,061
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

1174
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:26,770
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.

1175
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:28,859
Can I come up?
Okay. But be careful.

1176
01:06:28,959 --> 01:06:31,169
Don't let anybody see you.

[Doorbell ringing]

1178
01:06:55,856 --> 01:06:57,856
Hello, Keyes.

1179
01:07:02,693 --> 01:07:05,631
What's on your mind?
That broken leg.

1180
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:08,680
The guy had a broken leg.
What are you talking about?

1181
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,309
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

1182
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:14,398
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1183
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:16,317
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.

1184
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:20,064
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? What are you driving at?

1185
01:07:20,164 --> 01:07:24,752
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1186
01:07:24,852 --> 01:07:26,452
That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

1187
01:07:26,552 --> 01:07:28,751
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1188
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:32,509
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1189
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:36,434
Maybe he just didn't know that
he was insured.

1190
01:07:37,556 --> 01:07:38,946
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1191
01:07:39,046 --> 01:07:41,145
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1192
01:07:41,245 --> 01:07:42,184
Yeah.
You got his check?

1193
01:07:42,284 --> 01:07:44,052
Sure I did.

1194
01:07:44,152 --> 01:07:47,571
Got any bicarbonate of soda?
No, I haven't.

1195
01:07:47,671 --> 01:07:51,609
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1196
01:07:51,709 --> 01:07:54,218
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1197
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:56,617
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1198
01:07:56,717 --> 01:07:58,717
No. Not suicide.

1199
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:02,056
But not an accident, either.
What else?

1200
01:08:02,265 --> 01:08:03,453
Now look, Walter.

1201
01:08:03,553 --> 01:08:06,352
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000...

1202
01:08:06,452 --> 01:08:07,452
...if he's killed on a train.

1203
01:08:07,552 --> 01:08:09,331
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1204
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:13,228
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

1205
01:08:13,328 --> 01:08:15,848
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

1206
01:08:15,948 --> 01:08:19,356
One out of I don't know how many billions.

1207
01:08:19,456 --> 01:08:24,354
And add to that the broken leg. No,
it just can't be the way it looks.

1208
01:08:24,454 --> 01:08:28,331
Something has been worked
on us. Such as what?

1209
01:08:36,008 --> 01:08:37,547
Murder?

1210
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,397
Don't you have any peppermint
or something?

1211
01:08:39,497 --> 01:08:43,237
Sorry. Want a little soda water? No, no, no.

1212
01:08:43,484 --> 01:08:44,435
(Walter) Who do you suspect?

1213
01:08:44,535 --> 01:08:46,354
(Keyes) Maybe I like to
make things easy for myself.

1214
01:08:46,454 --> 01:08:48,352
But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary.

1215
01:08:48,452 --> 01:08:49,472
You mean the wife?
- Yeah.

1216
01:08:49,572 --> 01:08:52,010
That wide-eyed dame that just
didn't know anything about anything.

1217
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,030
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1218
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,309
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1219
01:08:55,409 --> 01:08:57,508
I don't claim to know how it
was worked, or who worked it...

1220
01:08:57,608 --> 01:08:59,907
...but all I know is that it was worked.

1221
01:09:00,007 --> 01:09:01,646
I've got to get to a drugstore.

1222
01:09:01,746 --> 01:09:04,565
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

1223
01:09:04,665 --> 01:09:07,453
Good night, Walter.
- Good night, Keyes.

1224
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:11,293
See you at the office in the morning.
- Yeah.

1225
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:13,820
I'd like to move in on her right now, tonight.

1226
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,899
If it wasn't for Norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy...

1227
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:20,537
I'd have the police after her
so fast it'd make her head spin.

1228
01:09:20,637 --> 01:09:22,096
They'd put her through the wringer...

1229
01:09:22,196 --> 01:09:24,875
...and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

1230
01:09:24,975 --> 01:09:26,894
Only you haven't got a
single thing to go on, Keyes.

1231
01:09:26,994 --> 01:09:29,172
Not too much.
Just 26 years experience...

1232
01:09:29,272 --> 01:09:35,307
...all the percentage there is, and
this hunk of concrete in my stomach.

1233
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,015
Can I have one of those things?

1234
01:09:47,973 --> 01:09:51,033
Good night, Keyes.
- So long, Walter.

1235
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:55,851
[Elevator door shuts]...

1236
01:10:03,247 --> 01:10:06,825
How much does he know?
- He doesn't know anything.

1237
01:10:06,925 --> 01:10:08,954
It's those stinking hunches of his.

1238
01:10:09,054 --> 01:10:10,313
And he can't prove anything,
can he?

1239
01:10:10,413 --> 01:10:15,853
Not if we're careful. Not if we
don't see each other for a while.

1240
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,589
How long a while?
- Until this dies down.

1241
01:10:18,689 --> 01:10:19,628
You don't know Keyes.

1242
01:10:19,728 --> 01:10:21,667
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

1243
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:23,367
He'll investigate you,
have you shadowed.

1244
01:10:23,467 --> 01:10:26,106
He'll watch you every minute from now on.

1245
01:10:26,206 --> 01:10:29,181
You afraid, baby?
- Yes, I'm afraid.

1246
01:10:29,674 --> 01:10:33,443
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of
us. We're not the same anymore.

1247
01:10:33,543 --> 01:10:36,540
We did it so we could be together, but
instead of that it's pulling us apart.

1248
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,300
Isn't it, Walter?
- What're you talking about?

1249
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:43,330
And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

1250
01:10:43,347 --> 01:10:45,347
Shut up, baby.

1251
01:10:48,864 --> 01:10:52,604
(operator) Pacific All Risk. Good afternoon.

1252
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,382
Hello, Mr. Neff.

1253
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,985
Hello.
- Lola Dietrichson.

1254
01:10:58,179 --> 01:11:00,999
Don't you remember me?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

1255
01:11:01,099 --> 01:11:03,207
Could I talk with you just a few minutes?

1256
01:11:03,307 --> 01:11:05,757
Somewhere where we could be alone?

1257
01:11:05,857 --> 01:11:08,322
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

1258
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:16,102
Is it something about what happened?

1259
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:19,857
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.

1260
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:23,709
I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.

1261
01:11:25,767 --> 01:11:28,256
Lou, do you mind if I use the
office alone for a few minutes?

1262
01:11:28,356 --> 01:11:30,651
No. It's all yours, Walter.

1263
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:38,351
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1264
01:11:38,451 --> 01:11:42,658
I'm not crazy. I'm not
hysterical. I'm not even crying.

1265
01:11:42,758 --> 01:11:46,296
But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong...

1266
01:11:46,396 --> 01:11:50,025
...and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

1267
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:51,065
When your mother died?

1268
01:11:51,165 --> 01:11:53,444
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1269
01:11:53,544 --> 01:11:54,463
We had a cabin there.

1270
01:11:54,563 --> 01:11:58,890
It was winter and very cold. My
mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1271
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:00,660
She had a nurse with her.

1272
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,648
There were just the three of us in the cabin.

1273
01:12:03,748 --> 01:12:06,297
One night I got up and
went into my mother's room.

1274
01:12:06,397 --> 01:12:08,156
She was delirious with fever.

1275
01:12:08,256 --> 01:12:11,805
All the bed covers were on the
floor and the windows were wide open.

1276
01:12:11,905 --> 01:12:12,974
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1277
01:12:13,074 --> 01:12:15,174
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1278
01:12:15,274 --> 01:12:18,401
Just then I heard a door open behind me.

1279
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,501
The nurse stood there.

1280
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:24,319
She didn't say a word, but
there was a look in her eyes...

1281
01:12:24,419 --> 01:12:26,419
I'll never forget.

1282
01:12:28,017 --> 01:12:30,975
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

1283
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:36,513
Do you know who that nurse was?

1284
01:12:36,613 --> 01:12:38,613
No. Who?
- Phyllis.

1285
01:12:38,652 --> 01:12:40,881
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1286
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:43,999
He wouldn't listen to me. Six
months later she married him...

1287
01:12:44,099 --> 01:12:46,138
...and I kind of talked myself out of the...

1288
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:48,277
...idea she could have
done anything like that.

1289
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:52,635
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

1290
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,374
You're not making sense, Miss
Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.

1291
01:12:56,474 --> 01:12:59,352
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

1292
01:12:59,452 --> 01:13:01,831
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

1293
01:13:01,931 --> 01:13:03,151
...pinning a black veil to it.

1294
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:06,508
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1295
01:13:06,608 --> 01:13:08,548
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1296
01:13:08,648 --> 01:13:10,187
Aren't you just imagining these things?

1297
01:13:10,287 --> 01:13:11,646
I caught her eyes in the mirror.

1298
01:13:11,746 --> 01:13:14,625
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

1299
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:16,725
That same look.

1300
01:13:16,834 --> 01:13:18,502
You don't like your stepmother, do you?

1301
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:20,302
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

1302
01:13:20,402 --> 01:13:22,721
I loathe her because she did
it. She did it for the money.

1303
01:13:22,821 --> 01:13:25,020
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1304
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,099
She's not going to get away with it
this time, because I'm going to speak up.

1305
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:29,578
I'm going to tell everything I know.

1306
01:13:29,678 --> 01:13:34,765
You'd better be careful, saying things like...
- I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1307
01:13:34,865 --> 01:13:36,865
[Sobbing]

1308
01:13:41,821 --> 01:13:43,821
I'm sorry.

1309
01:13:46,299 --> 01:13:48,934
I didn't mean to act like this.

1310
01:13:49,738 --> 01:13:52,646
All this that you've been telling
me, who else have you told?

1311
01:13:52,746 --> 01:13:53,916
No one.

1312
01:13:54,016 --> 01:13:57,234
How about your stepmother?
- Of course not.

1313
01:13:57,334 --> 01:13:59,334
I've moved out.

1314
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:01,922
I'm not living at home anymore.

1315
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:04,441
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1316
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:08,111
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.

1317
01:14:08,849 --> 01:14:10,578
Where are you living now?

1318
01:14:10,678 --> 01:14:13,706
I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood.

1319
01:14:13,806 --> 01:14:17,384
Four walls, and you just
sit and look at them?

1320
01:14:17,484 --> 01:14:19,484
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1321
01:14:21,642 --> 01:14:23,092
(Walter) So that evening
I took her to dinner...

1322
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:26,670
...at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera
Street where nobody would see us.

1323
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:28,895
I wanted to cheer her up.

1324
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:32,348
The next day was Sunday and we
went for a ride down to the beach.

1325
01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:35,027
She had loosened up a bit,
she was even laughing.

1326
01:14:35,127 --> 01:14:38,504
I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell
that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.

1327
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:41,493
It was dynamite,
whether it was true or not.

1328
01:14:41,593 --> 01:14:43,342
And I had no chance to talk to Phyllis.

1329
01:14:43,442 --> 01:14:45,522
You were watching her like a hawk, Keyes.

1330
01:14:45,622 --> 01:14:49,849
I couldn't even phone her because I
was afraid you had the wires tapped.

1331
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:53,777
Monday morning there was a note on my
desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.

1332
01:14:53,877 --> 01:14:56,696
For a minute I wondered
if it could be about Lola.

1333
01:14:56,796 --> 01:14:58,645
It was worse.

1334
01:14:58,745 --> 01:15:04,100
Outside your door was the last
guy in the world I wanted to see.

1335
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,424
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1336
01:15:14,657 --> 01:15:17,755
Hello, Keyes.
- I want to ask you something.

1337
01:15:17,855 --> 01:15:19,645
After all the years
we've known each other...

1338
01:15:19,745 --> 01:15:21,564
...do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1339
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:23,664
About what?
- About me.

1340
01:15:23,733 --> 01:15:26,282
Walter, I'm a very great man.
- Yeah?

1341
01:15:26,382 --> 01:15:29,001
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

1342
01:15:29,101 --> 01:15:31,000
...and murders don't come any neater.

1343
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,798
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1344
01:15:33,898 --> 01:15:36,826
...smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

1345
01:15:36,926 --> 01:15:39,275
I think Papa has it all figured out.

1346
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:43,034
Figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.

1347
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:45,982
Go ahead. I'm listening.
- You know what?

1348
01:15:46,082 --> 01:15:49,737
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1349
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,210
He wasn't?
- No, he wasn't.

1350
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:55,668
Now look, Walter. You can't
be sure of killing a man...

1351
01:15:55,768 --> 01:15:58,746
...by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1352
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,165
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1353
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,084
...and then throw his body on the tracks.

1354
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,263
Now that would mean either
killing him on the train...

1355
01:16:05,363 --> 01:16:08,901
...or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

1356
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:10,121
...and put him on the tracks.

1357
01:16:10,221 --> 01:16:14,471
Two possibilities, and I
personally buy the second.

1358
01:16:14,508 --> 01:16:16,008
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.

1359
01:16:16,108 --> 01:16:17,966
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

1360
01:16:18,066 --> 01:16:21,725
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1361
01:16:21,825 --> 01:16:25,073
...and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1362
01:16:25,173 --> 01:16:26,813
...then the somebody else jumped off...

1363
01:16:26,913 --> 01:16:29,352
...then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed.

1364
01:16:29,452 --> 01:16:32,682
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

1365
01:16:32,779 --> 01:16:34,788
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1366
01:16:34,888 --> 01:16:36,328
...they have the crutches to stare at...

1367
01:16:36,428 --> 01:16:38,767
...they never really looked at the man at all.

1368
01:16:38,867 --> 01:16:40,906
Fancy all right, Keyes, but
maybe it's a little too fancy.

1369
01:16:41,006 --> 01:16:44,753
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1370
01:16:44,853 --> 01:16:46,664
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1371
01:16:46,764 --> 01:16:49,521
The only guy who really got a good
look at this supposed Dietrichson...

1372
01:16:49,621 --> 01:16:51,621
...is sitting right outside my office.

1373
01:16:51,721 --> 01:16:56,226
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1374
01:16:56,647 --> 01:16:59,386
Come here, Mr. Jackson.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1375
01:16:59,486 --> 01:17:01,077
These are fine cigars you smoke.

1376
01:17:01,177 --> 01:17:02,795
Two for a quarter.
- That's what I said.

1377
01:17:02,895 --> 01:17:04,354
Well, did you study those photographs?

1378
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:06,373
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

1379
01:17:06,473 --> 01:17:08,193
Very thoroughly.
- Have you made up your mind?

1380
01:17:08,293 --> 01:17:10,192
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford
man. Medford, Oregon.

1381
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,311
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1382
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:15,310
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1383
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:17,509
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1384
01:17:17,609 --> 01:17:18,978
Yes.

1385
01:17:19,078 --> 01:17:21,146
Then my answer is no.
- What do you mean, no?

1386
01:17:21,246 --> 01:17:23,345
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1387
01:17:23,445 --> 01:17:24,545
Will you swear to that?

1388
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:26,544
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1389
01:17:26,644 --> 01:17:28,863
If I say it, I mean it. If I
mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1390
01:17:28,963 --> 01:17:30,502
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1391
01:17:30,602 --> 01:17:32,162
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1392
01:17:32,262 --> 01:17:34,140
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.

1393
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,519
How are you?
- Very fine, thank you.

1394
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:37,858
Never was better.
- Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1395
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:41,157
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

1396
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,856
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

1397
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:46,795
...about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1398
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:48,814
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1399
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,172
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

1400
01:17:51,272 --> 01:17:54,121
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

1401
01:17:54,221 --> 01:17:56,610
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1402
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,849
Come to think of it, he tried
to keep his back towards me.

1403
01:17:58,949 --> 01:18:01,447
But I'm positive just the same.
- Thank you, Jackson.

1404
01:18:01,547 --> 01:18:03,847
Of course, you understand this
matter is strictly confidential?

1405
01:18:03,947 --> 01:18:06,884
We may need you again down here in Los
Angeles, if the case comes to court.

1406
01:18:06,984 --> 01:18:09,603
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1407
01:18:09,703 --> 01:18:14,038
Expenses paid, of course.
- Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1408
01:18:14,371 --> 01:18:17,516
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

1409
01:18:17,529 --> 01:18:19,478
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1410
01:18:19,578 --> 01:18:23,477
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

1411
01:18:23,577 --> 01:18:26,235
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

1412
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:28,460
...the Dietrichson claim.

1413
01:18:29,043 --> 01:18:31,073
Well, take care of his hotel bill, will you?

1414
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,192
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1415
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:33,233
(Keyes) Yeah. He'll be right down.

1416
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,901
No. Never been up there.

1417
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:37,470
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

1418
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:41,257
Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way.
- Nope. I don't fish.

1419
01:18:41,357 --> 01:18:44,936
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1420
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:47,505
There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis.
- No relation.

1421
01:18:47,605 --> 01:18:49,884
Let me see. This man's an
automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1422
01:18:49,984 --> 01:18:52,183
A very reputable man, too, I'm told.
- All right, Mr. Jackson.

1423
01:18:52,283 --> 01:18:53,722
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

1424
01:18:53,822 --> 01:18:55,202
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1425
01:18:55,302 --> 01:18:58,420
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1426
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,490
Tonight?

1427
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:02,658
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1428
01:19:02,758 --> 01:19:05,846
I'd like to see before I leave.
- Osteopath?

1429
01:19:05,946 --> 01:19:09,645
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1430
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,194
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1431
01:19:11,294 --> 01:19:13,929
It's been a pleasure.
- Goodbye.

1432
01:19:15,702 --> 01:19:19,451
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1433
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,128
Murder's never perfect. Always
comes apart sooner or later.

1434
01:19:22,228 --> 01:19:24,567
And when two people are
involved, it's usually sooner.

1435
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:27,426
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1436
01:19:27,526 --> 01:19:29,445
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1437
01:19:29,545 --> 01:19:32,244
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime,
somewhere, they've got to meet.

1438
01:19:32,344 --> 01:19:33,563
Their emotions are all kicked up.

1439
01:19:33,663 --> 01:19:36,921
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1440
01:19:37,021 --> 01:19:39,360
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1441
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,760
But it isn't twice as safe.

1442
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,878
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1443
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:45,978
...and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1444
01:19:46,078 --> 01:19:47,736
...where they can get off at different stops.

1445
01:19:47,836 --> 01:19:49,975
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1446
01:19:50,075 --> 01:19:51,454
...all the way to the end of the line.

1447
01:19:51,554 --> 01:19:53,753
And it's a one-way trip, and
the last stop is the cemetery.

1448
01:19:53,853 --> 01:19:55,853
She put in her claim.

1449
01:19:56,162 --> 01:19:59,307
I'm gonna throw it right back at her.

1450
01:20:03,998 --> 01:20:05,687
Let her sue us if she dares.

1451
01:20:05,787 --> 01:20:08,426
I'll be ready for her and that somebody else.

1452
01:20:08,526 --> 01:20:11,586
They'll be digging their own graves.

1453
01:20:19,031 --> 01:20:21,580
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

1454
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,539
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

1455
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:29,399
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1456
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:56,610
Hello, Walter.
- Come over here.

1457
01:21:00,091 --> 01:21:03,831
What's the matter?
- Everything's the matter.

1458
01:21:04,849 --> 01:21:06,100
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1459
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,657
He's sitting back with his mouth
watering, waiting for you to sue.

1460
01:21:08,757 --> 01:21:10,457
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

1461
01:21:10,557 --> 01:21:14,212
What's he got to stop me?
- He's got plenty.

1462
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:17,353
He's figured out how it was worked.

1463
01:21:17,453 --> 01:21:19,153
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

1464
01:21:19,253 --> 01:21:20,991
...and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1465
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:23,310
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1466
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:26,749
Yeah? And then you're in court and a
lot of other things are going to come up.

1467
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:30,577
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1468
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:32,407
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1469
01:21:32,507 --> 01:21:33,465
The way she died.

1470
01:21:33,565 --> 01:21:36,425
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

1471
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:38,183
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1472
01:21:38,283 --> 01:21:40,502
She's been seeing you.
- I've been seeing her, if you want to know.

1473
01:21:40,602 --> 01:21:42,182
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1474
01:21:42,282 --> 01:21:44,881
She's putting on an act for you, crying
all over your shoulder, the lying...

1475
01:21:44,981 --> 01:21:47,180
Keep her out of this. All I'm
telling you is we're not going to sue.

1476
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,399
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

1477
01:21:48,499 --> 01:21:49,618
...even if you could have it,
because she's...

1478
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:50,817
...made you feel like a heel all of a sudden?

1479
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:52,333
It isn't the money anymore. It's our...

1480
01:21:52,433 --> 01:21:54,036
...necks. We're pulling
out, do you understand?

1481
01:21:54,136 --> 01:21:56,915
Because of what Keyes can do?
- You're not fooling me, Walter.

1482
01:21:57,015 --> 01:21:59,154
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1483
01:21:59,254 --> 01:22:01,972
You're afraid she might find out
someday and you can't take it, can you?

1484
01:22:02,072 --> 01:22:04,622
I said, leave her out of this.

1485
01:22:08,659 --> 01:22:09,868
It's me I'm talking about.

1486
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:12,007
I don't want to be left out of it.
- Stop saying that.

1487
01:22:12,107 --> 01:22:13,427
It's just that it hasn't worked as we wanted.

1488
01:22:13,527 --> 01:22:16,005
We can't go through with it, that's all.
- We have gone through with it.

1489
01:22:16,105 --> 01:22:17,155
The tough part is all behind us.

1490
01:22:17,255 --> 01:22:19,913
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1491
01:22:20,013 --> 01:22:22,282
...stick close together
the way we started out.

1492
01:22:22,382 --> 01:22:24,382
Watch it.

1493
01:22:40,644 --> 01:22:43,112
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

1494
01:22:43,212 --> 01:22:46,551
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1495
01:22:46,651 --> 01:22:50,538
You planned the whole thing.
- I only wanted him dead.

1496
01:22:50,638 --> 01:22:53,187
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

1497
01:22:53,287 --> 01:22:56,895
Is that what you're telling
me? And nobody's pulling out.

1498
01:22:56,995 --> 01:22:59,425
We went into this together, we're
coming out at the end together.

1499
01:22:59,525 --> 01:23:03,945
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1500
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:11,845
(Walter) Yes, I remembered.

1501
01:23:12,428 --> 01:23:15,557
Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...

1502
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,995
...about that trolley car ride...

1503
01:23:18,095 --> 01:23:21,843
...and how there was no getting
off till the end of the line...

1504
01:23:21,943 --> 01:23:24,153
...where the cemetery was.

1505
01:23:25,142 --> 01:23:28,841
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1506
01:23:28,941 --> 01:23:31,491
They're to put dead people in.

1507
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:36,227
I guess that was the first time I
ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1508
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:38,327
Dead, I mean.

1509
01:23:38,895 --> 01:23:42,040
And how it would be if she were dead.

1510
01:23:42,653 --> 01:23:45,872
I saw Lola three or four times that week.

1511
01:23:45,972 --> 01:23:49,750
One night we went up into the
hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.

1512
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:52,559
I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it was only with her that...

1513
01:23:52,659 --> 01:23:55,549
I could relax and let go a little.

1514
01:24:23,914 --> 01:24:25,914
Why are you crying?

1515
01:24:27,391 --> 01:24:29,512
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1516
01:24:29,671 --> 01:24:34,528
Of course I will, Walter. I
wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1517
01:24:34,628 --> 01:24:37,447
It's about Nino.
- Zachetti? What about him?

1518
01:24:37,547 --> 01:24:40,296
They killed my father
together. He and Phyllis.

1519
01:24:40,396 --> 01:24:43,286
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1520
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,585
What makes you say that?

1521
01:24:45,823 --> 01:24:48,972
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

1522
01:24:49,072 --> 01:24:51,520
It was Phyllis and him all along.

1523
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:55,489
Maybe he was just going with me as a
blind. And the night of the murder...

1524
01:24:55,589 --> 01:24:57,568
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1525
01:24:57,668 --> 01:25:01,027
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1526
01:25:01,127 --> 01:25:04,554
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1527
01:25:04,654 --> 01:25:05,685
Sick.

1528
01:25:05,785 --> 01:25:07,593
[Sobbing]

1529
01:25:07,693 --> 01:25:13,728
He couldn't show up, because the
train was leaving with my father on it.

1530
01:25:17,288 --> 01:25:21,283
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

1531
01:25:21,446 --> 01:25:23,395
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1532
01:25:23,495 --> 01:25:27,915
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

1533
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,920
(Walter) Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.

1534
01:25:38,398 --> 01:25:43,776
What was he doing up at her house?
I couldn't figure that one out.

1535
01:25:43,876 --> 01:25:47,253
I tried to make sense
out of it and got nowhere.

1536
01:25:47,353 --> 01:25:50,573
But the real braintwister came the next day.

1537
01:25:50,673 --> 01:25:54,581
You sprang it on me, Keyes, after
office hours, when you caught me...

1538
01:25:54,681 --> 01:25:56,480
...down in the lobby of the building.

1539
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:59,130
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1540
01:26:03,146 --> 01:26:06,055
Hello, Keyes.
- Just hang on to your hat, Walter.

1541
01:26:06,155 --> 01:26:08,124
What for?
- Oh, nothing much.

1542
01:26:08,224 --> 01:26:11,163
That Dietrichson case
just busted wide open.

1543
01:26:11,263 --> 01:26:15,088
How do you mean?
- The guy showed. That's how.

1544
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:17,470
What guy?
- The guy who helped her do it.

1545
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,570
The somebody else?

1546
01:26:20,059 --> 01:26:22,607
No kidding?
- Yeah. She just filed suit against us.

1547
01:26:22,707 --> 01:26:23,926
It's okay by me.

1548
01:26:24,026 --> 01:26:26,925
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

1549
01:26:27,025 --> 01:26:29,144
Come on. I'll buy you a martini, Walter.
- No thanks, Keyes.

1550
01:26:29,244 --> 01:26:30,164
With two olives.

1551
01:26:30,264 --> 01:26:32,443
No, I've got to get a shave and
a shoeshine. I've got a date.

1552
01:26:32,543 --> 01:26:35,990
Margie. I still bet she drinks from the bottle.

1553
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,720
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

1554
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:39,039
All you have to do is ask for them.

1555
01:26:39,139 --> 01:26:44,749
Don't like them, they always explode
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1556
01:26:47,245 --> 01:26:49,384
(Walter) I was scared stiff, Keyes.

1557
01:26:49,484 --> 01:26:52,193
Maybe you were playing
cat-and-mouse with me.

1558
01:26:52,293 --> 01:26:55,581
Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.

1559
01:26:55,681 --> 01:27:00,696
I had to find out, and I knew
where to look. In your office.

Confidential.
Dietrichson file.

1562
01:27:34,822 --> 01:27:37,451
With regard to your proposal to put
Walter Neff under surveillance...

1563
01:27:37,551 --> 01:27:39,170
I disagree absolutely.

1564
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:41,489
I have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime...

1565
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:45,718
...and he's definitely placed in
his apartment from 7:15 p. m. On.

1566
01:27:45,818 --> 01:27:49,105
In addition to this, I have known
Neff intimately for 11 years...

1567
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:52,364
...and I personally vouch for him
without reservation.

Furthermore, no connection
whatsoever has been established...

01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,959
...between Walter Neff and
Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...

1572
01:28:03,059 --> 01:28:06,677
...whereas I am now able to report that
such a connection has been established...

1573
01:28:06,777 --> 01:28:08,866
...between her and another man.

1574
01:28:08,966 --> 01:28:11,695
This man has been observed
to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...

1575
01:28:11,795 --> 01:28:15,623
...on the nights of July 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.

1576
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:19,301
We have succeeded in identifying
him as one Nino Zachetti...

1577
01:28:19,401 --> 01:28:21,790
...former medical student,
age of 28...

1578
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:24,029
...residing at Lilac Court Apartments...

1579

...12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.

1580
01:28:27,397 --> 01:28:30,706
We have checked Zachetti's movements
on the night of the crime...

1581
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:33,774
...and have found that
they cannot be accounted for.

1582
01:28:33,874 --> 01:28:36,982
I am preparing a more detailed
report for your consideration.

1583
01:28:37,082 --> 01:28:40,581
It is my belief that we already have
sufficient evidence against Zachetti...

1584
01:28:40,681 --> 01:28:43,769
...and Mrs. Dietrichson
to justify police action.

1585
01:28:43,869 --> 01:28:46,738
I strongly urge that this whole
matter be turned over to the office...

1586
01:28:46,838 --> 01:28:48,658
...of the district attorney.

Don't worry about Keyes.

unlocked and put the lights out.

Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:32:16,888 --> 01:32:19,716
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

1624
01:32:19,816 --> 01:32:22,315
...on a trolley car together. One
can't get off without the other.

1625
01:32:22,415 --> 01:32:24,574
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1626
01:32:24,674 --> 01:32:26,833
...riding together clear to the end of the line.

1627
01:32:26,933 --> 01:32:29,112
And the last stop is the cemetery.

1628
01:32:29,212 --> 01:32:32,230
Maybe he's got something there.
- You bet he has.

1629
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:34,948
Two people are gonna ride to
the end of the line, all right.

1630
01:32:35,048 --> 01:32:39,267
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1631
01:32:39,367 --> 01:32:42,665
Just who are you talking about?
- An acquaintance of yours.

1632
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:43,985
A Mr. Zachetti.

1633
01:32:44,085 --> 01:32:45,784
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

1634
01:32:45,884 --> 01:32:48,383
...because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

1635
01:32:48,483 --> 01:32:49,422
I was a sucker.

1636
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:52,141
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

1637
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:55,129
Nobody wanted to brush you off.
- Save it. I'm telling this.

1638
01:32:55,229 --> 01:32:57,178
It's been you and that Zachetti
guy all along, hasn't it?

1639
01:32:57,278 --> 01:32:58,777
That's not true.

1640
01:32:58,877 --> 01:33:02,872
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1641
01:33:03,106 --> 01:33:06,414
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

1642
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:09,432
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

1643
01:33:09,532 --> 01:33:14,632
What's happening to me all this time?
- Don't be silly, baby.

1644
01:33:17,818 --> 01:33:21,787
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1645
01:33:21,887 --> 01:33:23,085
That's what Keyes thinks.

1646
01:33:23,185 --> 01:33:25,325
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.

1647
01:33:25,425 --> 01:33:29,563
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1648
01:33:29,663 --> 01:33:31,472
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1649
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:36,109
Sometimes people are where they can't
talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1650
01:33:36,209 --> 01:33:40,037
And if it was you, they'd charge that
up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1651
01:33:40,137 --> 01:33:44,026
Sure they would, and that's
just what's gonna happen, baby.

1652
01:33:44,126 --> 01:33:46,475
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1653
01:33:46,575 --> 01:33:50,862
With the cops right behind him.
- It's all taken care of.

1654
01:33:50,962 --> 01:33:53,112
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1655
01:33:53,212 --> 01:33:56,909
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

1656
01:33:57,009 --> 01:33:58,539
...and Lola gets a chance to sound off...

1657
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:01,548
...before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

1658
01:34:01,648 --> 01:34:03,867
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

1659
01:34:03,967 --> 01:34:05,616
...so we can get the money and be together.

1660
01:34:05,716 --> 01:34:08,704
That's cute. Say it again. He came
here first to ask where Lola was.

1661
01:34:08,804 --> 01:34:10,743
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1662
01:34:10,843 --> 01:34:12,722
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

1663
01:34:12,822 --> 01:34:14,901
I kept hammering into him that
she was with another man...

1664
01:34:15,001 --> 01:34:19,179
...so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1665
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,857
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1666
01:34:21,957 --> 01:34:26,565
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

1667
01:34:26,665 --> 01:34:28,255
We're both rotten.

1668
01:34:28,355 --> 01:34:29,934
Only you're a little more rotten.

1669
01:34:30,034 --> 01:34:32,013
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1670
01:34:32,113 --> 01:34:35,471
...and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

1671
01:34:35,571 --> 01:34:38,489
Then somebody else would have come
along to take care of Zachetti for you.

1672
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:41,128
That's the way you operate, isn't it, baby?
- Suppose it is.

1673
01:34:41,228 --> 01:34:45,076
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1674
01:34:45,176 --> 01:34:50,191
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1675
01:35:03,847 --> 01:35:05,847
[Gun fires]

1676
01:35:08,205 --> 01:35:11,144
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

1677
01:35:11,244 --> 01:35:13,244
Better try it again.

1678
01:35:15,602 --> 01:35:18,322
Maybe if I came a little closer?

1679
01:35:27,916 --> 01:35:30,891
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

1680
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:41,755
Why didn't you shoot again, baby?

1681
01:35:46,706 --> 01:35:50,496
Don't tell me it's because you've
been in love with me all this time.

1682
01:35:50,596 --> 01:35:54,043
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1683
01:35:54,143 --> 01:35:57,232
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1684
01:35:57,332 --> 01:36:00,222
That's all you ever meant to me...

1685
01:36:00,779 --> 01:36:02,819
...until a minute ago...

1686
01:36:03,538 --> 01:36:07,023
...when I couldn't fire that second shot.

1687
01:36:07,577 --> 01:36:10,977
I never thought that could happen to me.

1688
01:36:11,175 --> 01:36:13,604
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
- I'm not asking you to buy.

1689
01:36:13,704 --> 01:36:15,704
Just hold me close.

1690
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:23,029
Goodbye, baby.

1691
01:36:23,129 --> 01:36:25,129
[Gun fires twice]

1692
01:37:15,345 --> 01:37:17,345
Zachetti.

1693
01:37:18,662 --> 01:37:20,662
Come here.

1694
01:37:25,579 --> 01:37:27,579
I said, come here.

1695
01:37:29,777 --> 01:37:32,686
My name is Neff.
- Yeah, and I still don't like it.

1696
01:37:32,786 --> 01:37:34,306
What do you want?

1697
01:37:34,406 --> 01:37:36,406
Look, kid.

1698
01:37:36,774 --> 01:37:39,952
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1699
01:37:40,052 --> 01:37:42,002
What's the gag? Suppose you
go on back down the hill...

1700
01:37:42,102 --> 01:37:43,601
...to the drugstore and make a phone call.

1701
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:45,700
Keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone.

1702
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,459
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1703
01:37:47,559 --> 01:37:49,997
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

1704
01:37:50,097 --> 01:37:51,117
She isn't worth a nickel.

1705
01:37:51,217 --> 01:37:53,556
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1706
01:37:53,656 --> 01:37:54,635
Tough, aren't you?

1707
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:56,635
Here, take the nickel and
call her. She wants you to.

1708
01:37:56,735 --> 01:37:58,584
She doesn't want any part of me.

1709
01:37:58,684 --> 01:38:01,113
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

1710
01:38:01,213 --> 01:38:03,632
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

1711
01:38:03,732 --> 01:38:05,831
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1712
01:38:05,931 --> 01:38:09,578
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1713
01:38:09,678 --> 01:38:11,678
Go on. That way.

1714
01:38:21,033 --> 01:38:24,178
(Walter) It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1715
01:38:24,431 --> 01:38:26,431
It's cold.

1716
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:30,878
I wonder if she's still lying
alone up there in that house...

1717
01:38:30,978 --> 01:38:33,868
...or if they've found her by now.

1718
01:38:34,627 --> 01:38:38,644
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1719
01:38:38,744 --> 01:38:40,744
[Coughing]

1720
01:38:41,863 --> 01:38:45,481
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1721
01:38:45,581 --> 01:38:51,838
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1722
01:38:51,938 --> 01:38:56,868
And I want you to take care
of her and that guy Zachetti...

1723
01:38:59,893 --> 01:39:03,633
...so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

1724
01:39:04,453 --> 01:39:06,453
Hello, Keyes.

1725
01:39:15,407 --> 01:39:17,787
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1726
01:39:18,845 --> 01:39:22,623
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1727
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:25,752
Or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed?

1728
01:39:25,852 --> 01:39:27,852
The janitor did.

1729
01:39:28,161 --> 01:39:30,670
Seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here.

1730
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:32,178
Yeah.

1731
01:39:32,278 --> 01:39:34,278
Wouldn't be surprised.

1732
01:39:35,437 --> 01:39:39,095
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1733
01:39:39,195 --> 01:39:41,195
So I gather.

1734
01:39:42,154 --> 01:39:45,383
How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

1735
01:39:45,483 --> 01:39:49,090
Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it.

1736
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:51,100
One you didn't quite figure out.

1737
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,005
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

1738
01:39:54,108 --> 01:39:57,423
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

1739
01:39:57,947 --> 01:40:01,092
Now I suppose I get the big speech...

1740
01:40:01,465 --> 01:40:05,323
...the one with all the two-dollar words in it.

1741
01:40:05,423 --> 01:40:07,423
Let's have it, Keyes.

1742
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:11,540
Walter, you're all washed up.

1743
01:40:14,019 --> 01:40:17,079
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

1744
01:40:17,737 --> 01:40:20,117
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1745
01:40:21,895 --> 01:40:24,700
What for?
So they can patch me up?

1746
01:40:25,453 --> 01:40:28,002
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1747
01:40:28,102 --> 01:40:31,321
So I can walk into that gas chamber
up at San Quentin on my own power?

1748
01:40:31,421 --> 01:40:32,920
Is that it, Keyes?

1749
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:35,020
Something like that.

1750
01:40:35,528 --> 01:40:37,717
I've got a different idea.
- Yeah?

1751
01:40:37,817 --> 01:40:39,346
Look, Keyes.

1752
01:40:39,446 --> 01:40:41,755
Suppose you went back to bed and
didn't find these cylinders...

1753
01:40:41,855 --> 01:40:44,074
...till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1754
01:40:44,174 --> 01:40:46,633
After that you can play it any way you like.

1755
01:40:46,733 --> 01:40:49,381
Would you do that much for me, Keyes?

1756
01:40:49,481 --> 01:40:53,230
Give me one good reason.
- I need four hours to get where I'm going.

1757
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:57,138
You're not going anywhere, Walter.
- You bet I am.

1758
01:40:57,238 --> 01:41:00,027
I'm going across the border.
- You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1759
01:41:00,127 --> 01:41:01,586
Good enough to try for.

1760
01:41:01,686 --> 01:41:05,534
You'll never make the border.
- That's what you think.

1761
01:41:05,634 --> 01:41:07,413
Just watch me.

1762
01:41:07,513 --> 01:41:09,692
You'll never even make the elevator.

1763
01:41:09,792 --> 01:41:11,792
So long, Keyes.

1764
01:41:31,982 --> 01:41:33,982
[Phone dialing]...

How you doing, Walter?
- Fine.

Only somebody moved the
elevator a couple of miles away.

1770
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,560
They're on the way.

1771
01:42:20,398 --> 01:42:22,887
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1772
01:42:22,987 --> 01:42:24,816
I'll tell you.

1773
01:42:24,916 --> 01:42:28,045
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1774
01:42:28,145 --> 01:42:30,732
He was right across the desk from you.

1775
01:42:30,832 --> 01:42:32,957
Closer than that, Walter.

1776
01:42:33,632 --> 01:42:35,632
[Panting]

1777
01:42:36,751 --> 01:42:38,751
I love you, too.
