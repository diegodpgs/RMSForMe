1
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:46,920
Right, let's sort the buyers from the spyers,
the needy from the greedy

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,440
and those who trust me
from the ones who don't.

3
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,800
Because if you can't see value here today,

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,600
you're not up here shopping,
you're up here shoplifting.

5
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,600
You see these goods?
You've never seen daylight, moonlight,

6
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,080
Israelites,
Fanny by the gaslight.

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,300
Take a bag, come on, take a bag.
I took a bag home last night -

8
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,320
it cost me a lot more than ten pound,
I can tell you.

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,840
Anyone like jewellery?
Look at that one there.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
Hand-made in ltaly,
hand-stolen in Stepney.

11
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,320
It's as long as my arm,
I wish it was as long as something else.

12
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,320
Don't think 'cos these boxes
are sealed up, they're empty.

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,760
The only man who sells empty
boxes is the undertaker.

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,000
And by the look of some of you lot here today
I’d make more money with my measuring tape.

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,840
Here, one price, ten pound.

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,000
- Did you say ten pound?
- Are you deaf?

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,480
That's a bargain. I'll take one.

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,400
Squeeze in if you can. Left leg,
right leg, your body will follow.
They call it walking.

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,900
Do you want one as well darlin’?
You do, that’s it, they're waking up.

20
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,430
Treat the wife -
treat somebody else's wife.

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,654
It's a lot more fun
if you don't get caught.

22
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:43,790
Hold on, you want one as well?
OK, darlin', show me a bit of life, then.

23
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,030
It's no good standing out there
like one o'clock half struck.

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,870
My own you’d better buy'em,
these are not stolen -

25
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,889
they just haven’t been paid for, and we
can’t get them again,
they’ve changed the bloody locks

26
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:55,370
Here, one for you. No good coming back
later when I've sold out.
- Nice bit of stuff.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,880
- "Too late, too late "

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
will be the cry when the man with
the bargains has passed you by.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,920
If you've got no money on you now,

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,120
you'll crying tears as big
as October cabbages.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Bacon, cozzers!

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,080
# So I said I'm on the roam
So I need a car

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,929
# And I know
that I'm getting alive

34
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,148
# And I say I got faith
in a season ##

35
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:24,160
'Ed can hustle
a few quid here and there.

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,600
'But his real talent
lies in cards -

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,000
'and gambling with cards.

38
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,320
'Bacon could see that his days

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,292
'of selling moody goods
on street corners are numbered.'

40
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:40,720
'lt's time to move on
and he knows it.'

41
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:03,707
What you talking about?
I'm bloody skinny, pal.

42
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:05,618
Yeah, yeah, 'course you are. All right ?

43
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,360
Nick the Greek, always a pleasure.
Tom, what have you been eatin'?
- I've been tellin' him...

44
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:10,880
- Enough, already !

45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,940
You two, join me in my office.

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,820
So how much is it then, Tom?

47
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,300
You know how much is, Nick.

48
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,060
- And that includes the amp, yeah?
- No.

49
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,100
That does not include the amp.

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,440
Shit, Tom. I thought
it included the amp.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,040
Well, it doesn't. I'll throw in one
of these telephones if you like,

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,880
but it does not include the amp.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Very nice.

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
I hope it includes the speakers.

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,320
It doesn't include the speakers
it doesn't include the amp.

56
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:45,254
And it's not supposed to include me getting
the hump with your stupid questions.

57
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,493
Now you want it, Nick, you buy it.

58
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:48,784
What else do I get with it?

59
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:51,400
You get a gold-plated Rolls Royce,
as long as you pay for it.

60
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:54,386
Don't know, Tom.
Seems expensive.

61
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:58,649
Seems... well, this seems
to be a waste of my time.

62
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:01,644
That is 900 nicker in any shop
you're lucky enough to find one in

63
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,294
and you're complaining
about 200?

64
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:05,500
What school of finance
did you study?

65
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,117
It's a deal, it's a steal.

66
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,177
It's the sale
of the fucking century.

67
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:12,633
In fact, fucking, Nick, I think
I'll keep it.

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,585
All right, all right, keep your alans on.

69
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:21,012
Here's a ton.

70
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:22,163
Jesus Christ!

71
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:24,635
You could choke
a dozen donkeys on that,

72
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:27,000
and you're haggling over 100 pound.

73
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,880
What d'you do when you're
not buying stereos, Nick,

74
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:30,312
finance revolutions?

75
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,894
£100 is still £100.

76
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:35,339
Not when the price is £200, it's not.

77
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,550
And certainly not when you've got
Liberia's deficit in your sky rocket.

78
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,701
Tighter than a duck's butt you are!

79
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:44,750
Now come on, let me feel
the fibre of your fabric.

80
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:47,932
'The skinny one is Tom.'

81
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:50,378
'And he's the entrepreneur
of the bunch.'

82
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:52,440
'He's got a couple of
dirty little fingers'

83
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,280
'in a couple of dirty little pies.'

84
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,000
'Nick, here, however,
has made it his business'

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,869
'to have all 20 fat
little fingers and toes'

86
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:02,111
'in every dirty, bent
and stolen pie in London.'

87
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:06,416
'Between the two of them, there ain't
much you can't get hold of.'

88
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:12,100
That's my 25 grand.

89
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:15,926
It's all there, it took me a long time
to earn that, so you treat it with respect.

90
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,307
What about the chef?

91
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:36,264
What've you come as?

92
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,137
Cupid, stupid.

93
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,509
That's the last time I'm getting anymore
fruit off of you, Tom.

94
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:46,091
You call that fresh ? There was more small
hairy armoured things in your fruit than it was fruit.

95
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:48,321
You should open a butchers,
not a grocers.

96
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,239
Well if you will order stuff
from Kathmandu,

97
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,166
don't be surprised if it picks up
a few tourists on route.

98
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:55,637
Anyway, enough about that.
Where's the money?

99
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,335
Oi! Keep your fingers
out of my soup!

100
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:02,458
'Soap is called Soap

101
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,558
'because he likes to keep his hands
clean of any unlawful behaviour.'

102
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,712
'He's proud of his job
and even more proud that it's legal.'

103
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:10,685
'He represents the more
sensible side of the four.'

104
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,911
Are you sure you can afford 25?

105
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,028
It depends on
how you look at it.

106
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,349
I can afford it as long as I see it again,
if that's what you mean.

107
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:24,786
Got the rest from
the fat man and Bacon?

108
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,501
Fat man, Bacon
and myself.

109
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:29,732
Looks like it's time
to make that call to Harry.

110
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,828
Who's this fat man, then, ey ?

111
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:33,528
Ey ?

112
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:37,603
D'you want a sandwich, Bacon?

113
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,812
'lt's not easy to take
a seat at this card table.'

114
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:45,994
'The amount of money involved
has to be 100 grand upwards'

115
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:48,373
'and there's no shortage
of punters.'

116
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,638
'The man who decides whether
you can play or not is this man -'

117

including himself like to call him,

118

'Hatchet Harry.'

119
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,279
You got it all?

120
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,767
100 grand.

121
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:06,664
Well, If you got it, you got it.
Now, if you don't mind...

122
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,781
- What's this Eddie like then?
- He's a fucking thief!

123

'Harry has a colleague,
a monster of a man,'

124

'Barry the Baptist.'

125
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:21,779
'The Baptist got his name
by drowning people for Hatchet.'

126
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,846
- Are you ever gonna fucking pay ?
- Yeah, I'll pay !

127
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:26,665
- Are you ever gonna fucking pay ?
- I'll pay, yeah! Yes, I'll pay !

128
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:27,209
'Barry makes sure

129

'the administrative side of the
business runs harmoniously.'

130
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,933
The boy's got a rare ability.

131
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,285
He seems to make cards
transparent. He's got...

132
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:38,545
All right, all right,
so we can say he's good.

133
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,985
Oh no, he's better than good.
He's a fucking liability.

134
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,172
Yeah, hold on, what
do you think of these?

135
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:49,010
- We're selling hundreds.
- Very nice, Harry.

136
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:51,127
What's it for?

137
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:55,017
Oh, don't play innocent with me,
Bazza. Spanking!

138
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,368
There's 25 from me,
Tom, Soap and yourself.

139
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:41,397
It's a 100 grand to the pound. So why the fuck
are you counting it?

140
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:43,220
Because I like to.

141
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,286
So a reasonable return should be
in the reason of 120 grand.

142
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,041
As for 25 grand invested,
going on previous experience.

143
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:51,589
Going on optimism.

144
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:54,400
Whatever it's going on - it should be enough
to send you on a cooking course.

145
00:08:55,738 --> 00:08:58,168
You're not funny, Tom.
You're fat -

146
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,540
and look as though you
should be, but you're not.

147
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:03,253
Fat! Who you calling...
Jesus!

148
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,818
It's good in here, innit?
Handy for the tube,

149
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:08,056
great electrics - I can
see why you moved in.

150
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,030
Don't knock it, it's "CHEEP",
like the budgie.

151
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:14,478
And nobody wants to live next
to the people we live next to.

152
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:17,545
- Anti-social to say the least.
- What d'you mean?

153
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,912
He means they're
thieving bastards.

154
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:23,081
I mean when they're not picking
peanuts out of poop,

155
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:26,325
they rip off unfortunate souls
of their own earned drugs.

156
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:32,748
Ssh. Not exactly thick,
these walls.

157
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:36,233
Nice work, John.
Get yourself a drink.

158
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,111
Is that it?

159
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,394
How many times must
I tell you, Plank?

160
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:48,969
You'll find a job worth doing, you'll
find your share improving.

161
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:50,761
Have you got a problem
with that?

162
00:09:54,593 --> 00:10:01,235
# Police and thieves
in the street

163
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:05,233
# Fighting the nation
with their... ##

164
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:10,225
You know, Charles, this gear
is getting heavier.

165
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:16,530
I've a strong suspicion we should've
been rocket scientists or...

166
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,960
Nobel Peace Prize winners...
something....

167
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:22,229
Peace Prize?

168
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:27,491
Be lucky to find your penis for a piss
if you keep smoking.

169
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,600
Who the hell's that?

170
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,040
All right, Willie?

171
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,715
Does it look like I am all right ?
Take this.

172
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,911
I'm in danger of breaking
sweat at any second.

173
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:55,996
Charles,
why've we got that cage?

174
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,920
Security.

175
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:02,913
That's right.
That's right. Security.

176
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:07,227
So what's the point in having it
if we're not gonna fucking use it?

177
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,935
Well, I would've used it, Winston,
but this is Willie.

178
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:12,711
- And Willie lives here.
- Yes, Charles.

179
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:16,582
But you didn't know it was Willie
until you opened the door, did you?

180
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:20,129
Chill, Winston. It's me.

181
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:24,249
Charlie knows it's me,
what's the problem?

182
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:27,213
The problem is, Willie,
that Charles and yourself

183
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,608
are not the quickest of cats
at the best of times.

184
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:35,454
So do as I say and keep
the fucking cage LOCKED!

185
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:38,651
- What is that?
- That's Gloria.

186
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,561
Yes, I know that's Gloria.
What's THAT?

187
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:44,680
Err...fertiliser.

188
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:48,083
You went out six hours ago
to buy a money counter.

189
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,131
And you come back with
a semi-conscious Gloria

190
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,446
and a bag of fertiliser ?

191
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:54,961
Alarm bells are ringing, Willie.

192
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,032
We need fertiliser, Winston.

193
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:59,693
We also need a money counter.

194
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:01,559
This money's gotta
be out by Thursday.

195
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,674
I'm buggered
if I'm gonna count it.

196
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,659
Oh, and, if you do have to buy
sodding fertiliser,

197
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:10,360
could you just be
a little more subtle?

198
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,726
What do you mean?

199
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,120
We grow copious amounts
of ganja, yeah?

200
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,024
Yeah.

201
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:23,640
And you're carrying a wasted
girl and a bag of fertiliser.

202
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,320
You don't look your average
horti-fucking-culturalist.

203
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,960
That's what I mean, Willie.

204
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,900
# "The Boss" #
by James Brown

205
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,300
# Paid the cost to be the boss

206
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:47,380
# Paid the cost to be the boss

207
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:52,020
# I paid the cost
to be the boss ##

208
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:59,476
- How long's he been in there, son ?
- About...20 minutes.

209
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,980
- Is he on his own?
- Yeah, just carrying a bag.

210
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,021
Let's pay him a little visit then,
shall we?

211
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,980
'Big Chris settles debts
for Harry.'

212
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,335
'The only thing he cares
more about than an unsettled debts'

213
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,061
'is his son and heir,
Little Chris.'

214
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:24,620
# Look at me

215
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:26,600
# Know what you see

216
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,600
# See a bad mother ##

217
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,160
This is one of them...
high-powered jobs, innit?

218
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:43,600
Aaagh!

219
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,880
I've got some bad news
for you, John.

220
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,560
What the fuck!

221
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,440
Mind your language
in front of the boy.

222
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,720
Jesus Christ!

223
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:56,840
That includes blasphemy as well.
Now tell me, John,

224
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,967
how can you be concentratin'
on improving this lovely tan -

225
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,609
and it is a lovely tan by the way-

226
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,448
when you've got more pressing
priorities at hand?

227
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,352
Tell Harry...l mean Mr Harry,

228
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,505
I've been busy,
I'm nearly there.

229
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:14,622
Check his locker, son.

230
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:21,309
I don't suppose there's any chance of you
lifting this sunbeam up, Chris, isn't it ?

231
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,510
He's not poor! He's got over a monkey,
and that's just in his wallet!

232
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:31,250
Fuckin' hell, John, you always walk round
with that in your pocket?

233
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,750
Oi! Use language like that again, sun,
you'll wish you hadn't!

234
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:36,346
Sorry, Dad.

235
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:38,479
Right. Put the rest
of the stuff in that.

236
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,436
You can go home
in a plastic bag tonight, John.

237
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,134
You owe what you owe.

238
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:48,046
And by the time this tan's faded
you wanna have paid.

239
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:56,952
- You never would've paid.
- Who would pay for shit?

240
00:14:56,952 --> 00:15:01,960
Exactly. I mean we just had to...

241
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:03,364
What the hell
are you doing here?

242
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,315
What's up?

243
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:08,964
Let me guess,
my foot in your arse.

244
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:12,035
Game o'cards - Hatchet Harry?

245
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:14,234
You're supposed to be
getting your rest in, boy.

246
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,573
You playing cards
tonight, son?

247
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:21,391
With Harry?

248
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:26,240
Don't be silly, Dad. I wouldn't
have anything to do with that.

249
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,379
Where did
he get a hundred grand?

250
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:40,080
He's got adhesive mates -
I mean they're Iike brothers.

251
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,920
They've tossed up
between 'em.

252
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,660
And JD is his dad,
and owns the whole property?

253
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,680
No mortgage, no debts.

254
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,480
Lock, stock - the fucking lot.

255
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,880
Don't you worry, Harry.
I've got it under control.

256
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,400
Good. You can get this
under contol now.

257
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,920
It seems that Lord Appleton Smythe
has run out of money.

258
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,240
and these little beauties
are up for auction.

259
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,380
But I'm not paying a quarter
of a million quid for 'em.

260
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,543
If you know what I mean,
Barry.

261
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,000
Make sure we get everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

262
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,840
I don't want to know who you use,

263
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,120
as long as they're not
complete muppets.

264
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,800
And don't tell 'em
what they're worth, Barry.

265

# "Spooky" #

# When everything
is getting kinda groovy #

268
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,160
Right, where was we?

269
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,146
Shotguns. What, like guns that fire shots?

270
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:33,848
Oh, you must be the brains, then.

271
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:35,742
That's right,
guns that fire shots.

272
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:40,126
Make sure you bring everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

273
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:43,149
There'll be a load of old guns.
That's all I want.

274
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,873
Everything else outside the cabinet,
you can keep, it's yours.

275
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,615
Oh, thank you very much.

276
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:50,775
There'd better
be something there for us.

277
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,753
It's a fucking
stately home,

278
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:54,816
of course there'll
be something there.

279
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:57,580
- Like what?
- Like fucking antiques.

280
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,666
Antiques! What the fuck
do we know about antiques?

281
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,872
- We rob post offices.
- We steal cars.

282
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:06,595
What the fuck do we know
about antiques, mate?

283
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,231
If it looks old,
it's worth money - simple.

284
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:14,155
So stop fucking moaning
and rob the place.

285
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:17,125
So who's the guv?
Who are we doing this for?

286
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:20,872
You're doing it for me -
is all you need to know.

287
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:24,360
You know
because you need to know.

288
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,098
I see. One of those on a
"need to know basis" things, is it ?

289
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:32,436
Like one of those
James Bond films.

290
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:36,014
Careful, remember who's giving
you this job.

291
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,080
Right, I'm off.
Call me when you're done.

292
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,640
Ta-ra.

293
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,440
Fucking northern monkeys.

294
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,400
I hate these fucking
southern fairies.

'Ed has been playing cards
since he could lift 'em up.'

that he had a big advantage.'

297

298

'or even good at counting them.'

00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:21,602
'Especially when
it comes to money.'

303
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,560
# Love is kind of crazy

304
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,400
# With a spooky
little boy like you ##

305
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:35,554
- Invitations.
- Invitations?

306
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:41,040
Yeah, invitations, you know, four pretty
white pieces of paper with your names on.

307
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,120
We got 100,000 bits of paper
with the Queen's head on.

308
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:45,385
Will that do?

309
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:49,800
Just you. The others, they can wait
next door in Samoan Jo's.

310
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:52,477
Samoan Jo's?
You mean the pub? Hold on...

311
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:56,560
Hold on to your fuckin' tongue
and I'll hold on to my patience, OK, sonny ?

312
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,480
No one in here tonight but card players
and I do mean: no one.

313
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,040
Evening, Fraser. Don, Phil.

314
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,360
It's a bit dramatic, innit?

315
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,160
Is it supposed to be symbolic?

316
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,880
Apparently it's for security.

317
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,080
Yeah? I'd have brought my gloves
if I'd have known.

318
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,265
You must be Eddy, JD's son.

319
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:28,625
You must be Harry.
Sorry, didn't know your father.

320
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:33,178
Never mind, son, you just might meet him
if you carry on like that.

321
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:36,370
Evening, Tanya. Been a while.

322
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,005
All right, Ed.

323
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:00,547
Right, we call each other Kenny,
OK, Gary?

324
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:01,714
All right, Kenny.

325
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:04,234
You gonna put your stocking on, or what?

326
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:06,501
I spent 120 quid on my hair -

327
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:09,136
If you think I'm pulling a stocking over,
you're very much mistaken.

328
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:11,268
You're gonna have to put something on.

329
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:15,893
This is three card brag, gentlemen.

330
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:18,766
That means three 3s are the highest,
then three aces,

331
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:20,340
then running down accordingly.

332
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:24,073
Then it's a running flush,
a run, a flush and then a pair.

333
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,502
An open man can't
see a blind man.

334
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,991
And it will cost twice the ante
to see your opponent.

335
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,097
Now don't fuck around, fellas.

336
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:36,101
You know the rules.
And you know I won't stand for it.

337
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:55,642
What are you doing?
Put that back.

338
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,727
We're here to rob the guns.

339
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:01,565
Put it back - it's crap anyway.

340
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:05,235
Come on.

341
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:25,422
What sort of pub is this here ?

342
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,299
It's a Samoan pub.

343
00:21:28,073 --> 00:21:29,244
What's that?

344
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,011
It's a cocktail -
you asked for a cocktail.

345
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:36,271
No, I asked you to give me
a refreshing drink.

346
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,311
I wasn't expecting
a fucking rainforest.

347
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:42,147
You could fall in love
with an orangutang in that.

348
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,649
You want a pint, go to the pub.

349
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:48,069
I thought this was a pub.

350
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:49,959
It's a Samoan pub.

351
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:53,950
Then whatever it is, can you get your man
to turn the TV down?

352
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:56,953
You can ask him if you like.
If I was you I'd leave him well alone.

353
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,372
Yeah. Get rid of that.
Bring us a Diet Coke.

354
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:03,894
'Scuse me, can you
turn that TV down?

355
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:11,009
No.

356
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,598
Oooh!

357
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:24,195
Whoa, whoa, Kenny.

358
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:25,956
What are you doing?

359
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:30,260
I am trying to find out
where they keep their money!

360
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:34,423
You twat. Can't you see
these people have got no money.

361
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,667
They can't even afford
new furniture.

362
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:39,180
We've got the guns.
What's the matter with you ?

363
00:22:39,704 --> 00:22:42,540
Every time we do a job,
you have to go burn people's feet.

364
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,000
What's wrong with you?

365
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:56,281
You wanna be more careful, old fella.

366
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:59,724
You very nearly took my man's
head clean off with that.

367
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,935
You all right, Kenny?

368
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,603
Kenny?

369
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:11,945
Ten grand, blind.

370
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:16,866
Twenty grand, open.

371
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:20,286
Deep end, eh?

372
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:23,289
Fold.

373
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:43,059
Gotcha!

374
00:23:55,238 --> 00:23:56,656
Twenty grand, open.

375
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:00,702
I fold.

376
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,081
Don't go spending that
all at once, boy.

377
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,506
Bloody 'ell!

378
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:15,258
What?

379
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:17,260
I thought you said there'd
be no staff, Barry.

380
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:19,179
Did you get those guns?

381
00:24:19,304 --> 00:24:21,222
You wanna see
what they did to poor Gary!

382
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:24,642
Gary, Gary.

383
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:26,838
I said, did you get those guns?

384
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:28,885
Yes, we got them!

385
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,050
Good. I'll speak to you later.

386
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:34,805
Gary, if you can hear me,

387
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,505
get back in the car now, mate, it's OK.

388
00:24:37,906 --> 00:24:40,158
Barry... Barry!

389
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:45,171
Fucking, sodding,
shandy-drinking bastard!

390
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,505
Gary !

391
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:48,752
# "Liar Liar" #
by The Castaways

392
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:50,668
# Liar liar, pants on fire

393
00:24:50,794 --> 00:24:54,597
# Your nose is longer

394

395

Know you've been bad

396

# Don't tell me different
I know it's a lie

397
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,696
# Come to me, honey
See how I cry

398
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:14,318
# Why must you hurt me?
Do what you do?

399
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:17,625
# Listen here, girl
Can't you see I love you?

400
00:25:17,628 --> 00:25:20,758
# Make a little effort
Try to be true

401
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,077
# I will be happy
Not so blue

402
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:41,294

# Your nose is longer

# You keep on
telling me those lies

405
00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:49,853
# Still going out
with other guys ##

406
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:51,275
Give me my money!

407
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:53,731
Give me back my money!
You fucking slags!

408
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,446
Give me my money !

409
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:00,469
Give me back my money!

410
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,699
Give it back!

411
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:05,618
Wankers! Wankers!

412
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:12,398
Come on, you. Not now, please.

413
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,420
Not now, oh you fucking bastard!

414
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:24,762
Fuck...you bastard.

415
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:27,765
Oh, my good God!

416
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:29,851
We'll take you to the cleaners!

417
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:41,112
Twenty grand open.

418
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,185
Thirty thousand.

419
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:46,492
Back to you already, Eddie.

420
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:50,496
Fifty grand.

421
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:55,001
Eighty grand.

422
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:57,764
One hundred grand.

423
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,679
Whoa, whoa whoa.
Look, fellas, I know...

424
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:02,007
I know you're not in,

425
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:04,802
which means no one cares
what you know.

426
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:08,264
Two hundred and fifty.

427
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:13,519
That's quite a raise.

428
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:17,273
That's one hundred and fifty
on my one hundred.

429
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:20,902
Yeah, and is there anything else
you want to say?

430
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:25,531
As you know, this puts us
in an awkward position.

431
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,816
I don't have enough
to continue.

432
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,830
We will have to see both your cards
if no one loans Eddie the money to continue.

433
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:34,999
It's a loan
or we see both your cards.

434
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,040
I will.

435
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:47,220
You will what?

436
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:51,307
I will loan you the money.

437
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:57,264
No, I think I'd rather
just turn 'em over.

438
00:27:57,814 --> 00:28:00,141
I'm not interested
in what you would rather.

439
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,456
I wanna keep going.

440
00:28:02,842 --> 00:28:04,837
I'm also offering you the money.

441
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:09,117
So we don't have to turn 'em over
because you can borrow.

442
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:13,788
I need two hundred
and fifty grand.

443
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:17,542
No, you need five hundred
grand to see me.

444
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,068
That's if I wanna see you.

445
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,507
Well, you're gonna have a problem
carrying on, ain't ya?

446
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,178
I'll see you.

447
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:34,934
OK, before I loan you this,
I expect -

448
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,602
- if you lose, of course -

449
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:38,855
my money back within a week.

450
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,692
Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

451
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:12,843
Is that it?

452
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:16,809
Now let's see his fucking cards.

453
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,530
# "l Wanna Be Your Dog" #
by The Stooges

454
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:35,119
# So messed up I want you here

455
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:43,086
# ln my room I want you here

456
00:29:47,606 --> 00:29:51,135
# Now we're gonna be
face to face

457
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:58,893
# And I'll lay right down
in my favourite place

458
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:07,402
# And now I wanna be your dog

459
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:11,280
# And now I wanna be your dog

460
00:30:11,406 --> 00:30:14,742
# And now I wanna be your dog #

461
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:24,877
# Well, come on! ##

462
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,091
Hello, boy.
Feeling a bit poorly?

463
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,968
I know your friends

464
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,605
are responsible
for most of the cash...

465
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:37,711
so I'm gonna give you
one week to find it.

466
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:41,561
Otherwise I will take a finger

467
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:43,957
of each of you
and your friends' hands

468
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:47,049
for every day that passes
without payment.

469
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,159
And then when you've
run out of digits -

470
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,165
your dad's bar,
and who knows what then.

471
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:54,949
All right, my son?

472
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:00,163
# "Why Did You Do lt?" #
by Stretch

473
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:04,000
# I've been thinking
about what you have done to me

474
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:08,671
# The damage is much deeper
than you'll ever see

475
00:31:08,796 --> 00:31:10,576
# Hit me like a hammer
to my head ##

476
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:14,343
This doesn't look good.

477
00:31:18,705 --> 00:31:21,976
'He then proceeded to explain the unfortunate
position they were in.'

478
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:25,373
'Harry was going to start sizing up
all their fingers in a week.

479
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,941
'Because he knew there was no way Ed
could settle that debt on his own.'

480
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:31,496
'Harry saw it
as their money on the table,'

481
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:34,511
'so it was also their debt
off the table.'

482
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,381
'Ed would hate to admit it, but he could've
kissed the old bastard for that.'

483
00:31:38,484 --> 00:31:40,627
'lf he said he wanted
to settle the debt on his own,'

484
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:41,891
'it would have been a lie.'

485
00:31:42,895 --> 00:31:46,209
I wish to Christ he would've
let me settle the debt on my own.

486
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:51,938
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Stop fucking about, Tom.

487
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,749
Now think about what
we're gonna do. Now sit down.

488
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:02,100
What's all the fuss
about Harry?

489
00:32:02,391 --> 00:32:04,143
Why don't we just
boycott the payment?

490
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,150
Let me tell you
about Hatchet Harry.

491
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:14,366
Once was this geezer, called Smithy
Robinson, who worked for Harry.

492
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:16,675
But it was rumoured
that he was on the take.

493
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,867
Harry's invited Smithy round
for an explanation.

494
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:22,232
Smithy didn't
do a very good job.

495
00:32:22,745 --> 00:32:23,686
Within a minute...

496
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,365
Harry's lost his rag.

497
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,985
Reached out for the nearest
thing at hand -

498
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:29,835
which happened to be
a 15-inch black rubber cock.

499
00:32:30,545 --> 00:32:34,799
He's then proceeded to batter
poor Smithy to death with it.

500
00:32:38,482 --> 00:32:40,864
Now that was seen as
a pleasant way to go.

501
00:32:41,055 --> 00:32:45,476
Hence Hatchet Harry
is a man you pay if you owe.

502
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:50,731
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

503
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:55,434
# I've been thinking
about what you have done to me

504
00:32:55,871 --> 00:32:59,324
# lmages much deeper
than you'll ever see

505
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:05,537
# Hit me like
a hammer to my head

506
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:09,542
# I wonder were you pushed
or were you led?

507
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,743
# Why did you do it?

508
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:15,006
# Why did you do
that thing to me? ##

509
00:33:19,803 --> 00:33:23,681
Golf - the best way
to spoil a good walk.

510
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:32,607
Winston Churchill said that.

511
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:35,860
I say it's a dog-eat-dog world.

512
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:38,279
And I got
bigger teeth than you two.

513
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:43,615
I think our friend is trying
to tell us something.

514
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:46,829
Perhaps not. Perhaps I should take
another swing just to make sure?

515
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:48,789
Give me a five iron, John.

516
00:33:48,914 --> 00:33:50,374
Certainly, Dog.

517
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:55,338
Now, keep still.

518
00:34:04,597 --> 00:34:06,849
Yes, Gordon, is there something
you'd like to tell us?

519
00:34:08,643 --> 00:34:10,770
- It's in the fireplace.
- Shut it, you idiot, he'll kill...

520
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:14,649
Yes, Gordon, you were saying?

521
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:17,522
It's in the fireplace.
Just pull it out. It's in the bottom.

522
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,897
It's in the fireplace, Frank.
Just pull it out.

523
00:34:21,245 --> 00:34:22,270
It's in the bottom.

524
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:26,452
Oh, Dog, I think you might wanna
have a look at this!

525
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:30,322
You gonna let me down now?

526
00:34:30,504 --> 00:34:33,423
No, I'm not
finished with you yet.

527
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,003
Steel.

528
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:41,050
Help! Help!

529
00:34:46,555 --> 00:34:48,015
Oh, Dog.

530
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,825
Who the hell's that?
It's only 12 o'clock.

531
00:34:57,608 --> 00:35:00,545
Use the cage,
that's what it's there for.

532
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:06,540
Who is it?

533
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:15,556
We have got security
for a reason, Willie.

534
00:35:15,703 --> 00:35:19,122
Chill, Winston. It's only Plank.

535
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:24,301
This weed's getting quite a rep, 
you know, fellas, all right ?

536
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,525
Easy.

537
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,325
Jesus!

538
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,616
Never saw you there.

539
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,017
Hello, love,
enjoying yourself?

540
00:35:33,602 --> 00:35:35,020
Is she compos?

541
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:36,620
What do you think?

542
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:40,901
Boo!

543
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,862
Fuck me!

544
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:44,822
Clean that up, Charles.

545
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:46,520
Sod you, you clean it up.

546
00:35:46,673 --> 00:35:50,375
Sorry, fellas, but that stupid cow
scared the fucking life out of me!

547
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:55,219
Never mind. Can you just
sit down, stay out the way?

548
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:00,367
Look, how much is it you want?

549
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,942
I'm...after an half weight.

550
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:07,619
Right. Well, that's 1,500 then.
Pass the scales, Willie.

551
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:11,265
Give us some gear, J.

552
00:36:14,954 --> 00:36:18,856
Any chance of actually
seeing the...money?

553
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,461
The odds are 100-1.

554
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:31,999
All is we need is five grand.

555
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:35,242
I'd rather put my money
on a three-legged rockin' horse.

556
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,716
The odds are 100-1 for a good
reason, Bacon - it won't win!

557
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:43,901
- Where's Eddie?
- Where do you think?

558
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,103
The bottom of a bottle,
and has been for two days.

559
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:50,454
- It's hit him hard.
- Yeah, it's hit us all hard!

560
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:53,517
Yeah, but he's got to tell his dad
he's about to lose his bar.

561
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:54,783
Listen to this one.

562
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:58,505
You open up a company, called
"Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club"

563
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:01,599
- You what?
- You take out an advert in the back
page of some gay mag,

564
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:05,763
advertising the latest
in arse-intruding dildos.

565
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:08,572
You sell it with...I dunno....

566
00:37:08,697 --> 00:37:10,971
"Does what no other
dildo can do until now"

567
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:13,108
"The latest and greatest
in sexual technology"

568
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:15,057
"Guaranteed results or money back",
all that bollocks."

569
00:37:15,187 --> 00:37:18,118
Now, these dilds cost 25 quid a pop -

570
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,601
that's a snip for the amount of pleasure
they're gonna give the recipients.

571
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,266
They send their cheques
to the other company name.

572
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:28,842
Nothing offensive, "Bobby's Bits"
or something, for 25 quid.

573
00:37:28,842 --> 00:37:32,221
You take that 25 quid,
you stick it in the bank until it clears.

574
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:33,902
Now this is the smart bit.

575
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:37,418
You send back the cheque
for 25 pound

576
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:39,209
from the other company name -

577
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:42,231
"Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club" -
saying "We're sorry,"

578
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:45,787
we couldn't get the supplies from
America - because they ran out of stock.

579
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:49,236
Now you see, how many people
cash that cheque.

580
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:51,700
Not a single soul.

581
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:56,662
Because who wants their bank manager
to know they tickle arse when he is
not paying in cheques!

582
00:37:57,932 --> 00:37:59,574
So how long do you have to wait
till you see a return?

583
00:37:59,674 --> 00:38:01,580
Probably
no more than four weeks.

584
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:08,823
A month ? So what fucking good is that
if we need it in six - no, five days?

585
00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:10,885
Well, it's still a good idea.

586
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:16,964
He may know we smoke a lot, burn a bit
of profit, but he can't have any idea

587
00:38:16,956 --> 00:38:19,908
how much hard currency
we've accumulated.

588
00:38:20,237 --> 00:38:23,314
I don't know. Do you know?

589
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,385
We can just...slice it
off the top.

590
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:31,454
You guys have got
to realise who this chap is.

591
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:34,792
He might look a bit silly,
but he's a fucking lunatic.

592
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,120
If he gets the slightest inkling we're not
throwing straight dice,

593
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,466
you and me are gonna know

594
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:42,958
what the sharp side
of a kebab knife feels like.

595
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:44,877
So you know these geezers well?

596
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:45,845
Well enough -

597
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:48,191
I've been buying gear off one
of 'em for a coupla years.

598
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:51,557
- So what they like, then?
- Poofs! Nothing heavy.

599
00:38:51,557 --> 00:38:53,773
Four public school boys,
soft as shite.

600
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,867
They ponce around in funny hippy clothes
all day talking bollocks

601
00:39:18,226 --> 00:39:19,915
they're just good at growing weed, that's all.

602
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:22,562
Business has got bigger
than what they could handle.

603
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:25,383
They can't all be stupid, can they ?

604
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:29,656
Think about it, they got a container
load of cash in shoe boxes,

605
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,265
they're selling class A gear -

606
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:33,842
can't you figure out
there's someone sensible involved ?

607
00:39:33,926 --> 00:39:35,291
What about security?

608
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,740
There's one steel gate as you go in,
but they never lock it.

609
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:40,780
What d'you mean they never lock it?
Why've they got it for there, then?

610
00:39:40,854 --> 00:39:43,030
I must've been there 50 times -
it's never locked.

611
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,213
They're not suspicious. Everyone
that goes there's a toff.

612
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:47,894
They're all into that karma crap -

613
00:39:48,024 --> 00:39:50,404
"If l don't harm nobody,
nobody harms me" stuff.

614
00:39:51,153 --> 00:39:52,504
No way they can get back to you?

615
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,613
Even if they could, they'd be too shit scared -
I'm a geezer.

616
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:58,283
They got no muscle - gutless faggots.

617
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:01,787
Fancy one?

618
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:05,954
What's all the flapping about?
You told the old man yet?

619
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,395
Hoping I won't need to.

620
00:40:09,044 --> 00:40:11,755
I've got a plan.
Now listen carefully.

621
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:25,359
- Hello, boys.
- Harry.

622
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,250
Do you want a drink?

623
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:30,201
Hello, my son.
D'you want a lolly?

624
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:32,192
Piss off, you nonce.

625
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:34,153
Oi, watch it!

626
00:40:34,357 --> 00:40:36,818
No, thanks, Harry.
We're both all right.

627
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:38,906
Nice shooter.

628
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:42,077
Yeah, one of a pair -
Holland and Holland.

629
00:40:42,202 --> 00:40:43,205
D'you wanna hold it?

630
00:40:43,418 --> 00:40:45,488
No, not my thing, thanks, Harry.

631
00:40:45,615 --> 00:40:48,039
Business good?
I imagine that's why I'm here.

632
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:51,037
Four young fellas got in deeper
than they could handle.

633
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:53,881
They owe me
half a million pound.

634
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:56,872
- How much?
- Half a million.

635
00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:00,888
I'm game.

636
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:04,016
Me too.

637
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,428
Oh, God!

638
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:11,992
Right. We hit 'em
as soon as they come back.

639
00:41:12,575 --> 00:41:14,801
We'll be prepared. Waiting.

640
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:17,823
And they're armed.

641
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:20,002
What was that? Armed?

642
00:41:20,507 --> 00:41:23,223
What d'you mean armed?
Armed with what?

643
00:41:23,431 --> 00:41:26,455
Bad breath, colourful language,
feather duster?

644
00:41:26,538 --> 00:41:29,152
What do you think
they're gonna be armed with?
Guns, you tit!

645
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:30,101
Guns ?

646
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,722
You never said
anything about guns.

647
00:41:32,962 --> 00:41:35,158
A minute ago this was
the safest job in the world.

648
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,550
Now it's turning into
a bad day in Bosnia!

649
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,111
Soap, stop being such a mincer.

650
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:43,185
- I've thought about that and...
- And what exactly?

651
00:41:43,485 --> 00:41:48,364
And... all we have to do is find out
who's carrying 'em.

652
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:52,220
Carying them ?
Well, they could all be carrying 'em
for what we know.

653
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:55,271
No. Only one of 'em carries
them going to the job.

654
00:41:55,537 --> 00:41:59,580
So I assume the same one will be carry 'em
when they come back from the job.

655
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:01,323
Oh - you assume, dear?

656
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:04,351
And what did I say about assumption -
being the brother of all fuck-ups?

657
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:06,254
It's the mother of all fuck-ups,
you stupid!

658
00:42:06,282 --> 00:42:08,598
Well, brother, mother,
any other sucker.

659
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:10,586
It don't make any difference.

660
00:42:11,526 --> 00:42:16,005
They're still fucking guns and
they still fire fucking bullets!

661
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,176
Soap, if you have a better idea
how to get £500,000

662
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:24,304
in the next few days,
let us know.

663
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:26,895
In the meantime, Tom,

664
00:42:26,995 --> 00:42:29,154
you talk to Nick the Bubble
about shifting the weed.

665
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:38,536
- Weed?
- No, it's not normal weed.

666
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,280
It's some fucked-up skunk, Class A,

667
00:42:41,363 --> 00:42:43,656
"l can't think
let alone move" shit.

668
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,145
Doesn't sound
very good to me.

669
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:47,899
Oh, neither me - it depends
what flicks your switch.

670
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:50,720
And the light is on and burning
brightly for the masses.

671
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:52,966
Anyway, do you know anyone?

672
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:55,326
I know a man, yes.

673
00:42:56,603 --> 00:42:58,922
Rory Breaker.

674
00:42:59,147 --> 00:43:01,258
Not that madman with an afro?

675
00:43:01,383 --> 00:43:03,369
I don't want anything
to do with him.

676
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:06,500
You won't have to.
Just get me a sample.

677
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,157
No can do.

678
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:12,144
What's that -
a place near Kathmandu?

679
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:13,743
Meet me half-way, mate.

680
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:15,672
It's all completely
chicken soup.

681
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,138
- It's what?
- It's kosher...as Christmas.

682
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,227
Jews don't
celebrate Christmas, Tom.

683
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:24,528
No, I never mind that.
I'm gonna need some artillery, too.

684
00:43:24,628 --> 00:43:26,200
Coupla sawn-off shotguns.

685
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,837
This is a bit heavy. This is London,
not the Lebanon.

686
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:30,635
Who d'you think I am?

687
00:43:30,865 --> 00:43:33,501
I think you're Nick the Greek.

688
00:43:33,832 --> 00:43:35,083
Hold those two.

689
00:43:37,474 --> 00:43:40,100
I don't normally have
anything to do with weed, Nick.

690
00:43:40,252 --> 00:43:42,314
But if it is
what he says it is,

691
00:43:42,514 --> 00:43:45,100
I'll take it off him for
three and a half grand a key.

692
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:48,503
That is if it is what he says it is.

693
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:50,624
I don't want to see it
after a sample,

694
00:43:50,824 --> 00:43:52,966
I don't want to touch it
after a sample.

695
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:56,250
I'll leave you in the capable
hands of Nathan here.

696
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:58,774
He'll sort out the details.

697
00:43:58,798 --> 00:44:01,076
But just let me tell you
one thing...

698
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,850
If the milk turns out
to be sour,

699
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:11,119
I ain't the kind
of pussy to drink it.

700
00:44:13,213 --> 00:44:14,706
D'you know what I mean?

701
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:22,881
- Rory Breaker.
- Rory ?

702
00:44:23,006 --> 00:44:26,300
You don't know Rory. He's not
to be underestimated.

703
00:44:26,678 --> 00:44:28,217
He's a funny-looking
fucker, I know.

704
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:31,024
But you've got to look past the hair
and the cute cuddly thing.

705
00:44:31,607 --> 00:44:33,725
It's all a deceptive façade.

706
00:44:35,227 --> 00:44:38,946
A few nights ago
Rory's roger iron busted.

707
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:42,805
So he's gone down the battle cruiser
to watch the end of the football game.

708
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:46,358
No one's watching the custard,
so he switches the channel over.

709
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,000
A fat geezer's north opens.

710
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:51,815
And he wanders up
and turns the lizar over.

711
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,997
"Now fuck off and watch it
somewhere else."

712
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,082
Rory knows claret is imminent,

713
00:44:57,165 --> 00:44:58,873
but he doesn't want to miss
the end of the game.

714
00:44:59,061 --> 00:45:02,345
So calm as a coma, picks up
the fire extinguisher,

715
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:05,400
walks straight past the jam rolls
who were ready for action

716
00:45:05,558 --> 00:45:07,600
and plonks it outside
the entrance.

717
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:10,702
He then orders an aristotle
of the most ping-pong tiddly

718
00:45:10,702 --> 00:45:14,450
in the nuclear sub
and switches back to his footer.

719
00:45:14,944 --> 00:45:17,286
"That's fucking it,"
says the geezer.

720
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:19,664
"That's fucking what?"
says Rory.

721
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:22,881
And he gobs out a mouthful of booze,
covering Fatty.

722
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:25,294
He flicks a flaming match
into his bird's nest

723
00:45:25,463 --> 00:45:28,424
and the geezer's lit up
like a leaking gas pipe.

724
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:31,575
Rory, unfazed,
turns back to his game.

725
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,953
His team's won, too. Four nil.

726
00:45:50,734 --> 00:45:53,972
Oi! ls your hair supposed
to look like that?

727
00:45:54,325 --> 00:45:56,698
- All right, short stuff.
- Never mind short stuff.

728
00:45:57,222 --> 00:46:00,150
Listen, the next time we do a job like this
we're gonna want more money, Barry.

729
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:03,100
Or we're going back
to post offices and cars. Fuck that!

730
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,192
Where's the others?

731
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,172
There was no others.

732
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:09,945
Stop fucking around.
The others - the old ones.

733
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:11,160
I don't know what you mean.

734
00:46:11,288 --> 00:46:13,598
There were two old guns there.
Where are they now?

735
00:46:14,178 --> 00:46:16,167
Not in the cabinet, there wasn't.

736
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:18,900
Oh, there was a couple of old hammer-lock
muskets the butler was carrying.

737
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,126
- But they were ours. We sold them.
- Well you better un-sell 'em, sharpish !

738
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:24,534
We had to sell them.
We needed the money.

739
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:26,955
I am not fucking interested.

740
00:46:27,308 --> 00:46:30,720
If you don't wanna be counting
the fingers you haven't got,

741
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,514
I suggest you get those guns.
Quick!

742
00:47:18,491 --> 00:47:22,644
Jesus! lf I pick 'em up,
will they stay in one piece?

743
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:24,354
Where'd you get them?

744
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:28,207
I got contacts. Listen, Tom -

745
00:47:28,424 --> 00:47:31,161
you point them at me, I'll shit
myself or do whatever you say to do.

746
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,928
Either way you get
the desired effect.

747
00:47:33,046 --> 00:47:35,532
Oh, they look very nice, I agree, but -

748
00:47:36,057 --> 00:47:38,179
well, they're lacking in criminal
credibility, ain't they?

749
00:47:38,379 --> 00:47:39,531
I might get laughed at.

750
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:41,100
How much d'you want
for these muskets?

751
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,581
700 each.

752
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:45,050
And what's that - a pound for every year
they been about?

753
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:48,801
I know they're antiques, but I ain't
paying antique prices.

754
00:47:51,893 --> 00:47:53,884
They're a bit long, ain't they?

755
00:47:53,943 --> 00:47:55,520
Sawn-offs are out.

756
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:58,076
People want a bit
more range these days.

757
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:02,124
Range ? I don't wanna blow the arse
out of this country grounded,

758
00:48:02,244 --> 00:48:04,866
but I don't want anyone
blowing a raspberry either.

759
00:48:05,701 --> 00:48:07,500
I want to look...fucking mean.

760
00:48:07,745 --> 00:48:09,547
Of course you'll look mean.

761
00:48:10,158 --> 00:48:11,300
You'll look really scary.

762
00:48:11,578 --> 00:48:14,316
Enough about that. What about
this geezer who sells drugs?

763
00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:16,607
Rory Breaker's standing by.

764
00:48:16,856 --> 00:48:20,535
You stand to make a lot
of money, tubby Tommy?

765
00:48:25,521 --> 00:48:28,052
I understand if this has come
as a bit of a shock.

766
00:48:28,502 --> 00:48:29,900
But let me tell you
how this can be resolved

767
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,464
by you, the good father.

768
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:34,349
Go on.

769
00:48:34,591 --> 00:48:37,761
- He likes your bar.
- Yes.

770
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:40,263
He wants your bar.

771
00:48:40,388 --> 00:48:42,816
And?

772
00:48:42,816 --> 00:48:45,352
D'you want me
to draw you a picture?

773
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:48,999
Look, that boy doesn't know
his arsehole from his earhole.

774
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:52,344
This is my bar. It's got
nothing to do with him.

775
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:53,509
What, and I care?

776
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,772
Remember, you do have
the luxurious advantage

777
00:48:56,772 --> 00:48:58,950
of being able to sustain
your son's life.

778
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,960
And you do have a reputation -

779
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,462
so I'll choose my words
very carefully.

780
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,665
You tell Harry
to go fuck himself.

781
00:49:11,494 --> 00:49:12,879
Now...

782
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,301
I'll put that down to shock.

783
00:49:18,426 --> 00:49:19,886
Only once.

784
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,100
Only once can l, or shall l,
let you get away with that.

785
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:29,244
Your son's got three days
to find half a mill.

786
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:32,509
But make up your mind
which you prefer -

787
00:49:32,734 --> 00:49:36,911
your bar...or your son.

788
00:49:41,522 --> 00:49:42,717
Plank goes in first.

789
00:49:42,977 --> 00:49:45,700
There's a cage, but it's never
locked, is it, Plank?

790
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:48,815
- Never.
- You don't wanna be ....

791
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:52,289
All right, once he's got himself set,
he gets the rest of us in.

792
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:56,414
Now we'll get nasty with a couple of'em,
shit 'em up, ok, or whatever.

793
00:49:56,714 --> 00:49:58,941
Now these wankers shouldn't
give us any problems.

794
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:02,209
Like any cowboys - there'll
be a few tools lying around.

795
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:06,279
When the job's done, we come
straight back here and unload.

796
00:50:06,618 --> 00:50:08,849
And Robert's
your father's brother.

797
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,000
Everyone savvy?

798
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:13,217
Sweet.

799
00:50:13,517 --> 00:50:15,424
Have a look at these.

800
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:19,423
And what are we supposed
to do with these?

801
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:22,795
Put them on your head, stupid.

802
00:50:22,795 --> 00:50:24,783
Christ!

803
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:27,695
If you think I'm gonna
turn up there clean-shaven,

804
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:30,551
and greet them with a grin on my face,
you've got another think coming.

805
00:50:30,937 --> 00:50:32,600
Now these fellas - they're your neighbours.

806
00:50:32,684 --> 00:50:36,722
I thought it might be a good
idea to disguise ourselves a little.

807
00:50:37,145 --> 00:50:40,977
Right...er, yeah, good thinking,
Soap. Well done.

808
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,300
I brought weapons as well.

809
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:45,753
Weapons?
What do you mean weapons?

810
00:50:48,216 --> 00:50:49,277
These.

811
00:50:49,845 --> 00:50:51,688
Jesus!

812
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,275
Let's keep 'em covered up.

813
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:57,809
Couldn't you get
anything a bit bigger?

814
00:50:59,104 --> 00:51:01,704
What, like that?

815
00:51:02,295 --> 00:51:03,429
What d'you think?

816
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,552
I think you need help.

817
00:51:07,914 --> 00:51:10,564
Bar steward, can we have
a coupla drinks, please.

818
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,500
Have you seen your dad?

819
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:15,228
Hatchet sent
one of his men round.

820
00:51:15,677 --> 00:51:17,395
Oh, shit. When?

821
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:21,273
Crazy.

822
00:51:32,362 --> 00:51:34,898
Where'd you get these,
a fucking museum?

823
00:51:35,071 --> 00:51:37,231
Nick the Greek.

824
00:51:38,656 --> 00:51:40,100
How much did you part with?

825
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,760
700 for the pair.

826
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,669
Drachmas, I hope.

827
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:46,562
I'd feel safer
with a chicken drumstick.

828
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,507
These are gonna do
more harm than good.

829
00:51:51,276 --> 00:51:54,000
Jesus, Tom. Do these work?

830
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:56,843
I don't know. Look nice though, don't they ?
I rather like 'em.

831
00:51:56,904 --> 00:51:59,000
Oh, that's top of the list of priorities,
is that it?

832
00:51:59,132 --> 00:52:03,300
Ladies, back to more important
issues, if you don't mind.

833
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:07,607
We've only got two real guns -
apparently that's what they are.

834
00:52:07,814 --> 00:52:09,920
So we find a good place
to hide next door.

835
00:52:10,116 --> 00:52:13,114
We wait till it sounds out the right
time, then we, jack-in-the-box,

836
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,993
Iook nasty and stuff, cocoon 'em
in gaffer tape, nick their van,

837
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,747
swap the gear into the new van
and bring it all back here.

838
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:23,490
As long as we're all out
of our hiding places quickly,

839
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,479
it's the last thing
they're gonna expect.

840
00:52:26,171 --> 00:52:30,150
Oh, and if Tom or anyone else for that matter 
feels like giving 'em a bit of a kicking,

841
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:32,321
I'm sure it won't do any harm.

842
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:36,162
Yeah, little bit of pain
never hurt anybody.

843
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:38,499
If you know what I mean.

844
00:52:38,815 --> 00:52:42,125
Also, I think knives
are a good idea.

845
00:52:42,551 --> 00:52:45,076
Big, fuck-off shiny ones.

846
00:52:45,478 --> 00:52:48,190
Ones that look like
they could skin a crocodile.

847
00:52:48,334 --> 00:52:51,154
Knives are good because
they don't make any noise.

848
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,733
And the less noise they make, the
more likely we are to use 'em.

849
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,300
Shit 'em right up.

850
00:52:57,529 --> 00:52:59,885
Makes it look
like we're serious.

851
00:53:00,275 --> 00:53:03,789
Guns for show,
knives for a pro.

852
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:07,828
Soap, is there something
we should know about you?

853
00:53:08,128 --> 00:53:12,113
I'm not sure what's more
worrying, the job or your past?

854
00:53:15,213 --> 00:53:18,190
Come on, girls.

855
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,700
Where the fuck are they going?
Shift a piano?

856
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:35,092
I thought this was meant
to be a robbery.

857
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:37,664
Where'd they get those outfits?

858
00:53:37,994 --> 00:53:39,970
Not a bad idea that.

859
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,573
All right, it's Plank.
Is Willie there?

860
00:53:43,064 --> 00:53:45,456
No, I'm afraid he's not.
He's out at the moment.

861
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:46,969
Perhaps you can help.

862
00:53:47,451 --> 00:53:50,286
Perhaps I can't, Plank,
if you know what I mean.

863
00:53:50,629 --> 00:53:54,148
Look, if you could just open the door so
I could talk without shouting.

864
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:56,474
I can't help you, Plank.

865
00:53:56,474 --> 00:53:59,395
I think you'll find
it's in your interest.

866
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:00,896
Hold on, OK?

867
00:54:01,296 --> 00:54:04,707
Look, Willie, it's Plank outside for you.
He says it's in our interest.

868
00:54:05,104 --> 00:54:08,013
Listen, I don't care if it's
King-fucking-Kong,

869
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:10,599
he's not coming in here,
not today.

870
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:14,286
Hold on. We are in business
and...correct me if I'm wrong, but --

871
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,089
that is business.

872
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:19,635
Corrected. That's a walking
accident that we can do without.

873
00:54:19,835 --> 00:54:23,640
Jesus. He's OK... He knows
only to buy weights now.

874
00:54:23,776 --> 00:54:26,443
We're looking at at least
a couple of thou'.

875
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:28,290
What do you think, Winston?

876
00:54:29,931 --> 00:54:32,428
Willie, this is
the last time. All right?

877
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:34,701
But you and the money
are going out the back.

878
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:36,496
If he knows you're here,
he'll be all day.

879
00:54:36,718 --> 00:54:38,457
And just clear this shit up!

880
00:54:39,716 --> 00:54:42,250
- What, now?
- Yes! Now!

881
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Just get rid of him quick.

882
00:54:44,766 --> 00:54:46,831
All right. Just coming.

883
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:52,115
What the fuck is he doing?

884
00:54:55,355 --> 00:54:58,662
Come on, I can't wait
out here all day!

885
00:54:59,124 --> 00:55:01,319
All right. Just coming.

886
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,940
I thought you was gonna
leave me out there all day.

887
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,000
I didn't know you were
a removals man, Plank.

888
00:55:10,238 --> 00:55:13,900
Lives and learns, don't ya?
Keep the gates locked now here?

889
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,326
Ya, sorry. Gotta
do business like this now.

890
00:55:17,326 --> 00:55:19,100
Can't be too careful these days.

891
00:55:19,347 --> 00:55:20,371
I know.

892
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,425
Shut it! You say a fucking word, the right ear goes,
another one - and your left!

893
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:26,859
- What are you doing, Plank?
- What do you think I'm doing?

894
00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:28,917
Hang on, what are you doing?

895
00:55:29,252 --> 00:55:32,276
Unlock the gate!
Oi! I say unlock the fucking gate!

896
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:35,506
That's it. Go, go, go!
Fucking move!

897
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,680
What the fuck's going on?

898
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,756
Just hang on, I've got the keys.

899
00:55:43,097 --> 00:55:46,300
The gate's locked! I thought they weren't gonna
let the fucking gate locked.

900
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:47,520
What've you done to Fauntleroy?

901
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:49,594
I didn't touch him.
He just passed out.

902
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:53,313
Don't you stand there. Get the fucking door shut!
D'you want the world to see this?

903
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:57,901
What's going on down there?

904
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,505
Shit!

905
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:11,310
Charles, get the rifle out.

906
00:56:12,223 --> 00:56:13,732
We're being fucked.

907
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:14,916
It must be this one.

908
00:56:15,216 --> 00:56:18,207
Hold that gun. Plank, give me the keys.
Give me the keys, Plank.

909
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,904
Don't point that at my bollocks!
Point it in there!

910
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:24,492
Planks of wood. I'm working
with fucking planks of wood.

911
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:25,535
Shit !

912
00:56:27,503 --> 00:56:28,650
What the fuck is that?

913
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,487
- What the fuck's that?
- IT'S ME BREN GUN!

914
00:56:31,561 --> 00:56:34,878
Don't you think you could've brought something
a little bit more practical?

915
00:56:35,698 --> 00:56:38,587
Don't none of you slags move.
I'll kill the fucking lot of you!

916
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,963
Who you gonna kill, Plank?
There's no one fuckin' there?

917
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:46,948
Aaagh! They fucking shot me!

918
00:56:47,148 --> 00:56:49,211
Well, shoot 'em back.

919
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:54,082
Jesus, Plank! Couldn't you get
smokeless cartidges?

920
00:56:54,186 --> 00:56:55,615
I can't see a bloody thing !

921
00:56:55,923 --> 00:56:58,648
Aaagh! Shit, I've been shot.

922
00:56:58,784 --> 00:57:01,549
I don't fucking believe this.
Could everyone stop getting shot?

923
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:05,429
John, sit down and patch
yourself up, you tart!

924
00:57:05,462 --> 00:57:07,302
It's a fucking air rifle!

925
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:16,831
- What the fuck was that?
- Well, that was the bren gun.

926
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:19,794
You fire that gun again, you're a dead man.
Understand? Dead!

927
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:22,761
- No ifs, no buts, you're a fucking dead man!
- All right, all right!

928
00:57:22,761 --> 00:57:25,279
I've got bollock ache with this.
Where's my fucking gun?

929
00:57:30,434 --> 00:57:35,737
All right. Now I've got your attention.
Firstly, I'm gonna blow his toes off.

930
00:57:38,072 --> 00:57:39,374
There go his toes.

931
00:57:39,885 --> 00:57:42,354
Now if you want me out of here,
in five minutes flat,

932
00:57:42,654 --> 00:57:45,880
open the fucking gate
'cause I'm gonna blow his leg off!

933
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:49,714
They're gonna fucking kill us
if we do, man.

934
00:57:50,337 --> 00:57:52,857
Poor J'll certainly get it
if we don't. He's serious.

935
00:57:53,157 --> 00:57:55,337
I'm losing patience.
Hurry up, girls!

936
00:57:55,537 --> 00:57:58,902
It's all right, all fucking right!

937
00:57:59,785 --> 00:58:02,298
Willie, he doesn't know
you're here..., just .....

938
00:58:03,592 --> 00:58:06,519
Sort something out.

939
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:19,815
And all your friends,
there's a good lad.

940
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:23,614
- There's only three of us here.
- I don't believe you.

941
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:28,258
- Fuck, I'm gonna blow his leg off.
- I mean it. There's only three of us!

942
00:58:28,758 --> 00:58:32,391
- Plank?
- Yeah, one of 'em's out.

943
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:38,225
Now open the gate.

944
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:03,225
Up, up, up, there's a good lad.

945
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,816
John, get them tied up.
Plank, where's the money?

946
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:26,858
There, in those shoe-boxes.

947
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:46,889
- Where?
- Out the back.

948
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,869
- And the weed?
- Out the back.

949
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:51,229
- Point.
- With what?

950
00:59:51,529 --> 00:59:54,429
- Your fucking hands, now!
- I'm tied up.

951
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:56,387
Well, nod your head or something!

952
00:59:57,581 --> 00:59:58,541
Check it out.

953
00:59:59,249 --> 01:00:02,092
Plank, get Paul out that van lively.

954
01:00:17,403 --> 01:00:18,698
Knife.

955
01:00:23,517 --> 01:00:26,524
I'm gonna cut him.
Make sure he knows he's dead.

956
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:27,843
How you doing, Mick?

957
01:00:27,543 --> 01:00:31,165
How d'you think I'm doing?
He's fucking nearly chopped my arm off.

958
01:00:39,867 --> 01:00:42,268
Jesus Christ.

959
01:00:47,355 --> 01:00:48,664
Gordon Bennett.

960
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:50,675
What the fuck's
been going on here?

961
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:54,842
Shut up, you idiot.
It's Hanukkah.

962
01:00:55,715 --> 01:00:56,779
Don't just stand there.

963
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:58,871
Look at the bags, can you fit it all in?

964
01:00:59,427 --> 01:01:03,937
There's a lot...l can't
get Epping Forest in my van.

965
01:01:05,047 --> 01:01:08,026
'Can't'. I don't hear 'can't'.
Bollocks to 'can't'.

966
01:01:08,116 --> 01:01:11,378
You'll fit it all in
if you have to make two trips.

967
01:01:16,111 --> 01:01:17,798
Bollocks!

968
01:01:19,237 --> 01:01:22,666
You got a ticket already. Now if you
don't move it, we will move it for you.

969
01:01:22,749 --> 01:01:25,016
- I'll only be a minute.
- You've already been 15.

970
01:01:25,403 --> 01:01:29,054
- Look, come and have a look.
- At what exactly?

971
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:32,210
- Well, the van's half full.
- So?

972
01:01:32,433 --> 01:01:36,384
So, all I've got to do
is fill it up, put you in it...

973
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:37,536
What?

974
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:42,633
..and I'm off.

975
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,837
Do you think you can carry
more than one bag this time?

976
01:01:53,078 --> 01:01:55,299
- I can't. My neck, Dog.

977
01:01:56,056 --> 01:01:58,761
- How many more bags ?
- Just a couple.

978
01:01:59,617 --> 01:02:02,249
Mick, you dead yet?

979
01:02:03,332 --> 01:02:07,667
I'll be all right. Once I've
dealt with that lanky prick.

980
01:02:08,215 --> 01:02:10,098
Do it quietly.

981
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:15,697
It's time to say "Goodnight, nurse".

982
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,381
Where the fuck
did she come from?

983
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:11,029
That is it. Tie her up.
We're out of here.

984
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,696
Not like that,
you idiot. Give it us here.

985
01:03:41,675 --> 01:03:43,153
What you doing, Ed?

986
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:44,666
D'you want one?

987
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,720
No, I fucking don't.
You cannot make a cup of tea, Edward.

988
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:51,352
The entire British Empire
was built on cups of tea.

989
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,016
Yeah, and look what happened to that.

990
01:03:53,116 --> 01:03:56,479
And if you think I'm going to war
without one, mate, you're mistaken.

991
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,206
Going to war with what?

992
01:03:58,642 --> 01:04:02,234
Have you forgotten
those guns, you dozy prat?

993
01:04:22,986 --> 01:04:25,459
You won't get away with this.

994
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:30,373
- Paul, what's that?
- It's a traffic warden.

995
01:04:30,602 --> 01:04:33,555
I can see it's a fuckin' traffic warden,
what's he doing in the back of the van?

996
01:04:33,853 --> 01:04:35,208
He was gonna call the cozzers.

997
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:40,609
Fair enough -
we'll deal with him later.

998
01:04:42,874 --> 01:04:44,534
How we doing, Tom?

999
01:04:44,895 --> 01:04:46,206
Right as rain.

1000
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:48,653
I'm just gonna take care of the cabs.

1001
01:04:48,689 --> 01:04:50,618
Keep us posted.

1002
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:56,871
All right, mate, do you do airports?

1003
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:01,496
Where the hell are we gonna hide?

1004
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:07,029
Don't complicate things.
Just hide.

1005
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,948
We're on.

1006
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:40,466
They weigh a pound or two!

1007
01:05:40,677 --> 01:05:42,446
Shut up and back up!

1008
01:05:44,557 --> 01:05:46,938
Spin round, big boy.

1009
01:05:50,087 --> 01:05:51,052
Fuck!

1010
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,292
Stay down. Stay down!

1011
01:06:00,406 --> 01:06:03,253
Tie 'em up. Tape 'em up.
Hands and face.

1012
01:06:03,602 --> 01:06:05,530
On the floor!

1013
01:06:05,715 --> 01:06:07,981
Bend over the fucking desk.

1014
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,527
Keys. I want keys, now.

1015
01:06:18,014 --> 01:06:19,374
I'll find ya.

1016
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:21,991
'Course you will, sweetheart.

1017
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:23,531
I'll find ya.

1018
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:26,736
What d'you think this is?
Fucking hide-and-seek?

1019
01:06:27,232 --> 01:06:29,474
That one. Search that one.

1020
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:42,897
Right, I'll see you in the van,
when you've finished with handsome here.

1021
01:07:01,153 --> 01:07:03,131
Jesus. That wasn't
too bad, was it?

1022
01:07:08,226 --> 01:07:11,242
When the bottle in my arse has
contracted, I'll let you know.

1023
01:07:11,788 --> 01:07:14,921
Bacon, see what we've got.

1024
01:07:15,154 --> 01:07:16,906
Let's have a butchers, ey?

1025
01:07:21,985 --> 01:07:23,870
We've hit the jackpot, lads.

1026
01:07:25,197 --> 01:07:27,953
We've got God knows how much
of this stinking weed.

1027
01:07:28,969 --> 01:07:31,244
A shitload of cash.

1028
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:34,712
And a traffic warden.

1029
01:07:34,906 --> 01:07:35,827
What?

1030
01:07:38,524 --> 01:07:40,654
Jesus, Ed.
We got a traffic warden.

1031
01:07:42,365 --> 01:07:44,241
I think he's still alive.

1032
01:07:44,781 --> 01:07:47,111
He's got claret
coming out of him somewhere.

1033
01:07:48,126 --> 01:07:49,477
What did they want
with a traffic warden?

1034
01:07:49,477 --> 01:07:51,268
I don't know.
I don't think we need him.

1035
01:07:51,465 --> 01:07:53,578
Knock him out and dump him
at the lights.

1036
01:07:53,725 --> 01:07:55,706
Knock him out? What d'you mean,
knock him out? Knock him out with what?

1037
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:58,399
I don't know! Use your imagination.

1038
01:08:03,976 --> 01:08:06,001
Don't touch him up.
Knock him out.

1039
01:08:06,261 --> 01:08:07,572
I'll knock you out in a minute!

1040
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:10,565
Look, you wanna knock him out,
you knock him out.

1041
01:08:11,976 --> 01:08:14,137
I fucking hate traffic wardens.

1042
01:08:25,336 --> 01:08:28,644
It's about time you gave my
young friends a visit, Chris.

1043
01:08:32,472 --> 01:08:34,774
Tomorrow's the day
and mum's the word.

1044
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:36,434
Now I can't have that,
can l, Baz?

1045
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,353
No, Harry, you can't.

1046
01:08:38,478 --> 01:08:40,689
I mean it's a liberty.

1047
01:08:41,414 --> 01:08:44,025
And I can't have a liberty taken,
can l, Chris?

1048
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,986
No, Harry, you can't.

1049
01:08:47,071 --> 01:08:50,282
I mean, it's enough
to give me the arsehole.

1050
01:08:51,536 --> 01:08:53,779
And I can't have the arsehole,
can l, boys?

1051
01:08:53,894 --> 01:08:56,580
No, Harry, you can't.

1052
01:09:02,728 --> 01:09:05,338
All right, that's it.
We're done.

1053
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:07,314
We're off.

1054
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:10,029
Here, Ed, are you sure it's a good
idea taking this back to yours?

1055
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:12,423
Why, it's the only place we can take it,
and the last place they're gonna look.

1056
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,470
Anyway, fuck it. The battle
is over and the war is won.

1057
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:20,052
Now, Tom, you take this to Nick the
Bubble and we get rid of it quick.

1058
01:09:33,367 --> 01:09:36,245
This skunk
is as good as it gets.

1059
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,418
All right.
We'll take it. Half price.

1060
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:45,448
I don't think he'll like that.

1061
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,776
And you said three five a key.
And... and you know that's a good price.

1062
01:09:49,012 --> 01:09:50,888
That was yesterday I said three and a half.

1063
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:53,191
And now it's today
if I'm not mistaken.

1064
01:09:53,549 --> 01:09:56,602
We'll take it tomorrow.
Half price.

1065
01:09:57,117 --> 01:09:59,958
If he wants to get rid of it
quick, he'll have to take it.

1066
01:10:00,058 --> 01:10:05,040
Now look, I've got a race coming up in a minute,
so if you'd just be kind enough to...

1067
01:10:13,157 --> 01:10:14,088
Lenny,

1068
01:10:14,188 --> 01:10:16,994
take that round to Snow White
and the three little chemists.

1069
01:10:17,094 --> 01:10:19,008
They should have
a gander of that.

1070
01:10:19,058 --> 01:10:21,805
I want a second opinion.

1071
01:10:26,207 --> 01:10:28,117
Hang on a minute, Nathan,
something stinks.

1072
01:10:28,217 --> 01:10:30,468
Yeah, your fucking aftershave.

1073
01:10:30,678 --> 01:10:32,479
Fuck you, funny man.

1074
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,550
For God's sake, help me.

1075
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:39,640
I'm in pain.
I'm in so much pain, Jesus!

1076
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:40,967
Go in slowly, Nathan.

1077
01:10:41,252 --> 01:10:43,358
Fuck you, funny man.
You go first.

1078
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,487
Just get the fuck in there, will you ?

1079
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:48,894
I want this house searched for bugs,
I mean I want it stripped.

1080
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:52,443
Where is the poin in that ?
Even if there was a bug,
they'd have taken it with 'em.

1081
01:10:52,593 --> 01:10:54,709
It's a bit late
for you to start thinking, John.

1082
01:10:54,909 --> 01:10:57,285
If it's a possibility,
that's good enough for me.

1083
01:10:57,643 --> 01:11:01,610
I want you to strip this place.
I want every slag this side of Ceylon
pulled in.

1084
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:04,583
And tortured...badly.

1085
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,358
I want to know
who's responsible for this,

1086
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,957
otherwise I'm gonna hold
you all responsible.

1087
01:11:17,092 --> 01:11:18,671
Not a bad day.

1088
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:22,528
That pile takes care of Harry.

1089
01:11:24,019 --> 01:11:25,437
What's left over?

1090
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,481
Give me half a chance
to count it.

1091
01:11:29,089 --> 01:11:31,188
What about this gear, then, ey?

1092
01:11:37,814 --> 01:11:39,531
Oh, what, you want
a toke on that?

1093
01:11:39,981 --> 01:11:42,032
No. I don't think I want any
of that horrible shit.

1094
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:44,996
Can we lock up
and get drunk now, please?

1095
01:11:46,964 --> 01:11:50,638
We shot one of them...
in the...er, throat.

1096
01:11:50,838 --> 01:11:51,797
What d'you want, a medal?

1097
01:11:51,997 --> 01:11:55,513
I'll shoot you in the fuckin throat
if I don't get my ganja back.

1098
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:59,735
The one you shot.
Is he still in there now?

1099
01:11:59,969 --> 01:12:01,464
No, it was another one.

1100
01:12:01,639 --> 01:12:04,602
That's more like it.
Where is he?

1101
01:12:05,561 --> 01:12:07,407
Well, they...they
took him with them.

1102
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:10,379
He's still, still alive.

1103
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:14,069
What did you shoot him with?
An air gun?

1104
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:23,787
Look, we grow weed.
We're not mercenaries.

1105
01:12:24,371 --> 01:12:26,415
You don't say.

1106
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:30,085
Who could it be?
Where do we start, Rory?

1107
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,389
Mr Breaker.

1108
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:35,507
Today my name is Mr Breaker.

1109
01:12:35,632 --> 01:12:37,817
You think this
is a coincidence?

1110
01:12:38,055 --> 01:12:39,886
This white shite
steals my things

1111
01:12:39,886 --> 01:12:41,916
and thinks that he can
sell it back to me!

1112
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:44,216
He's got less brains
than you, Lenny!

1113
01:12:45,309 --> 01:12:47,186
Get Nick - the greasy wop

1114
01:12:47,269 --> 01:12:51,524
shistos pezavengy gammore
Greek bastard round here now,

1115
01:12:51,524 --> 01:12:55,027
if he's still stupid enough
to be on this planet.

1116
01:13:20,486 --> 01:13:23,066
# Come with me,
I'll fill you with desire

1117
01:13:23,536 --> 01:13:27,687
# Take my hand and we'll walk
this land together ##

1118
01:14:27,786 --> 01:14:30,741
Your stupidity might be
your one saving grace.

1119
01:14:30,948 --> 01:14:31,909
Uuh?

1120
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:34,284
Don't uuh me, Greek boy.

1121
01:14:34,284 --> 01:14:37,436
How is it your fucking stupid,
soon-to-be-dead friends

1122
01:14:37,436 --> 01:14:40,319
thought that they might be able
to steal my cannabis

1123
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,304
and then sell it back to me?

1124
01:14:42,304 --> 01:14:44,611
Is this a declaration of war?

1125
01:14:44,611 --> 01:14:47,607
Is this some white cunt's joke
that black cunts don't get?

1126
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:51,393
'Cause I'm not fucking laughing,
Ni-ko-las!

1127
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,224
I know you couldn't
have known my position,

1128
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:57,970
'cause you're not that stupid
that if you did,

1129
01:14:58,108 --> 01:15:00,302
you wouldn't have turned up here
scratching your arse,

1130
01:15:00,402 --> 01:15:05,282
with that "what's going on here" look
slapped all over your Chevy Chase.

1131
01:15:06,696 --> 01:15:10,565
But what you do know
is where these people live.

1132
01:15:16,787 --> 01:15:19,195
If you hold back anything,
I'll kill you.

1133
01:15:19,707 --> 01:15:23,270
If you bend the truth, or I think
you are bending the truth, I'll kill you.

1134
01:15:23,617 --> 01:15:25,614
If you forget anything,
I'll kill you.

1135
01:15:25,714 --> 01:15:30,030
In fact, you're gonna have to work
very hard to stay alive, Nick.

1136
01:15:30,463 --> 01:15:32,866
Now do you understand
everything I've said?

1137
01:15:33,813 --> 01:15:37,512
Because if you don't,
I'll kill you.

1138
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:43,487
Now, Mr Bubble and Squeak...
you may enlighten me.

1139
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:48,746
So we've got a bit
of a problem, don't we?

1140
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,173
Er, well...yeah, yeah, we do.

1141
01:15:51,265 --> 01:15:55,036
Yea, yeah, we do. In fact, this is a little bit more
than looking a bit of a problem, isn't it ?

1142
01:15:55,086 --> 01:15:58,223
On the scale of things, you could say it's the
Mount fucking Everest of problems!

1143
01:15:58,223 --> 01:16:01,163
And the reason it's such a
mon-fucking-struosity of a problem is...

1144
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,279
you don't have the first idea
who did this to us, have you?

1145
01:16:04,292 --> 01:16:06,956
Dog, we've... we've been up all night.
It's no one from round here.

1146
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,698
We've had 'em all lined up
against the wall.

1147
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:10,892
If it was a toerag
from round the manor, we'd know.

1148
01:16:10,892 --> 01:16:14,282
- We'd know.
- You'd know? You'd fucking know?

1149
01:16:14,305 --> 01:16:17,030
You wouldn't know if it was
the next door fucking neighbours!

1150
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,598
Now get out there and find them!

1151
01:16:18,598 --> 01:16:23,485
I'm sick of the fucking sight of you!
Get out of the fucking sight!
You look shit!

1152
01:16:34,765 --> 01:16:38,616
"Scarface" -
I've watched "Scarface".

1153
01:16:39,292 --> 01:16:42,864
If you want to know how to do
a drug deal, you watch "Scarface".

1154
01:16:45,095 --> 01:16:46,995
That really inspires confidence.

1155
01:16:47,165 --> 01:16:50,043
- This guy, Rory Breaker...
- Rory Breaker ?

1156
01:16:50,476 --> 01:16:52,408
The psychotic black dwarf with an afro?

1157
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:53,986
That'll be the same man, yes.

1158
01:16:54,186 --> 01:16:56,849
I've heard of him -
he's a fucking lunatic.

1159
01:16:56,949 --> 01:16:59,511
Well, he can afford to do the deal
at the price we're selling.

1160
01:16:59,599 --> 01:17:00,848
It's not worth him
giving us any trouble.

1161
01:17:00,918 --> 01:17:03,765
Cause he knows we'll be a pain
in the arse. And who needs a pain in the arse?

1162
01:17:03,765 --> 01:17:05,752
I'd take a pain in the arse
for half a million quid.

1163
01:17:06,102 --> 01:17:07,753
You'd take a pain
in the arse for air miles.

1164
01:17:08,153 --> 01:17:09,995
Tom, the fatter you get,
the sadder you get.

1165
01:17:09,995 --> 01:17:11,884
Will you two stop flirting
for a minute?

1166
01:17:12,184 --> 01:17:16,564
After we pay Hatchet,
this deal puts us up...

1167
01:17:16,993 --> 01:17:19,742
nearly 200,000 pounds each.

1168
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,430
That's not bad for a morning's work,
I think you'll agree.

1169
01:17:34,324 --> 01:17:35,884
So they had the cash.

1170
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,928
And the puff.

1171
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,103
Cheeky bastards. Count it.

1172
01:17:40,228 --> 01:17:42,230
Shit, Dog. There's a lot.

1173
01:17:42,355 --> 01:17:44,744
Do you want to do it next door?

1174
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,332
We're not going next door

1175
01:17:46,332 --> 01:17:48,966
'til we've flayed
them dead men walking.

1176
01:17:49,593 --> 01:17:50,772
We'll count it upstairs.

1177
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:53,584
I don't want them to see you
fingering the money when
they walk through the door...

1178
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:55,430
Dog, look...

1179
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,207
Give it us here...dozy bastard.

1180
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:05,244
Check your guns.
Get yourselves well hid.

1181
01:18:05,467 --> 01:18:09,428
You wait till they get right inside
the door, then you give it to'em.

1182
01:18:09,975 --> 01:18:13,428
Give me them shooters,
you can use your own.

1183
01:18:23,925 --> 01:18:24,758
Yeah.

1184
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:26,681
That's no way
to answer the phone.

1185
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,134
Is that you, Dean?

1186
01:18:28,234 --> 01:18:30,857
No, it's Lord fucking Lucan.
Who do you think it is?

1187
01:18:30,857 --> 01:18:32,093
What can I do for you?

1188
01:18:32,381 --> 01:18:34,918
You know those guns I sold you,
I need them back.

1189
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:37,701
Not likely I'm afraid. I don't think
I'll be seeing them again.

1190
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:39,987
Look, I've got the money
to pay for them.

1191
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:42,810
I'm sure you do.
But don't think you understand.

1192
01:18:42,969 --> 01:18:45,361
I ain't gonna be seeing them
or the guns again.

1193
01:18:45,816 --> 01:18:46,926
We can't get them.

1194
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:48,814
If we can't get them,
we can't get them.

1195
01:18:49,332 --> 01:18:51,378
Well, you'll have to fucking get them.

1196
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:53,901
We made a fucking deal for
everything inside the cabinet.

1197
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:57,203
Inside, out-fucking-side -
I don't give a shit.

1198
01:18:57,306 --> 01:19:00,809
- You get those guns because if you don't...
- Oh yeah, Bazza, or what ?

1199
01:19:00,809 --> 01:19:02,885
Have you heard
of Harry Lonsdale?

1200
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,620
Otherwise known as "Hack You
Up With an Hatchet Harry"?

1201
01:19:06,736 --> 01:19:08,870
Well, this is...

1202
01:19:09,151 --> 01:19:11,850
James Bond, need-to-know time.

1203
01:19:11,984 --> 01:19:16,096
When you dance with the devil,
you wait for the song to stop.

1204
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,064
Know what I mean?

1205
01:19:22,637 --> 01:19:25,947
I mean find 'em,
torture 'em and kill 'em.

1206
01:19:26,147 --> 01:19:28,146
And bring back
what belongs to me.

1207
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:33,039
Because if you don't,
your family's bang in trouble.

1208
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:35,222
Who was that?

1209
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,683
That was Harry Horrible Hatchet.

1210
01:19:37,796 --> 01:19:39,243
Jesus, I've heard of him.

1211
01:19:39,371 --> 01:19:42,570
Shit, they were
his fucking guns we sold.

1212
01:19:42,932 --> 01:19:44,285
We've got to find them.

1213
01:19:44,707 --> 01:19:48,965
Now no fucking about now, Nick.
Where can I find those guns?

1214
01:20:21,598 --> 01:20:23,600
Six black cocks
and a little white kitten

1215
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:25,518
sitting on the side
of the road.

1216
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:31,229
We're gonna do
a proper decoration job.

1217
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:34,651
I want the grey skies
of London illuminated.

1218
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,572
I want that house painted red.

1219
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:43,115
All right, there's this brass
standing on the corner, right?

1220
01:20:43,196 --> 01:20:45,914
Dwarf walks up to her
carrying a suitcase...

1221
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:48,285
Winston there
is gonna come along

1222
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:50,103
and see if he recognises
any of them.

1223
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:52,710
Now watch out for these fellas -

1224
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:57,545
they've got a bit of an arsenal
and they don't mind using it.

1225
01:20:57,869 --> 01:21:00,262
...and I'm taking down her panties...

1226
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:04,847
Now does everyone here know
what they got to do?

1227
01:21:04,847 --> 01:21:06,685
Yeah.

1228
01:22:16,463 --> 01:22:18,673
What the fuck is going on?

1229
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,594
You got something here
for me, have you?

1230
01:23:06,144 --> 01:23:08,765
Come on, chop-chop.

1231
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:17,899
Thank you very much.

1232
01:23:19,009 --> 01:23:22,120
- He's got the guns.Go ahead you get them.
- Why me?

1233
01:23:22,471 --> 01:23:23,936
You're supposed
to be the hard case...

1234
01:23:23,936 --> 01:23:26,735
You go get the guns!
I drive the car!

1235
01:23:32,301 --> 01:23:33,157
Good boy.

1236
01:23:33,281 --> 01:23:37,845
- Go get the fucking guns.
- I'm not going get the fucking guns!
YOU get the fucking guns!

1237
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,754
You fucking big...

1238
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:44,995
All right. Wrap them guns up.

1239
01:23:45,101 --> 01:23:46,409
Count the money.

1240
01:23:47,292 --> 01:23:48,656
Put your seat belt on.

1241
01:23:49,001 --> 01:23:53,202
Fucking guns, we've got to get the fucking
guns or we're dead!

1242
01:24:07,824 --> 01:24:10,785
..so I made sure I fucked
the one that was coughing.

1243
01:24:24,507 --> 01:24:28,497
Out of the car, you yuppy fucker!
Aaaaaaaagh !

1244
01:24:56,539 --> 01:24:58,182
He's the one
we shot in the neck.

1245
01:24:58,262 --> 01:25:01,252
Is that right, Mr Botanical?

1246
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,513
Jesus!

1247
01:25:41,668 --> 01:25:44,996
I don't believe this.
What the fuck has happened here?

1248
01:25:45,246 --> 01:25:46,620
Jesus.

1249
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,594
The money. The gear.

1250
01:26:03,012 --> 01:26:04,540
This is fucked.

1251
01:26:04,928 --> 01:26:07,527
No money. No weed.

1252
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:11,114
It's all been replaced
by a pile of corpses.

1253
01:26:11,518 --> 01:26:14,899
All right. Don't panic.
Let's think about this.

1254
01:26:14,899 --> 01:26:17,803
No, fuck that,
you can think about it.

1255
01:26:17,903 --> 01:26:20,584
I'm panicking and I'm off.

1256
01:26:28,673 --> 01:26:30,626
How did you get your hands
on these, then?

1257
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,962
The boys had 'em.

1258
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:33,368
I know you like
these sort of things -

1259
01:26:33,468 --> 01:26:35,597
wondered if you wanted 'em.

1260
01:26:35,722 --> 01:26:37,849
Yeah, I'll have 'em.

1261
01:26:38,016 --> 01:26:41,352
- Was it hard getting the money?
- Not especially.

1262
01:26:42,687 --> 01:26:44,752
Upset a few characters, though.

1263
01:26:46,307 --> 01:26:47,392
Have you counted it?

1264
01:26:47,573 --> 01:26:49,406
Yeah, it's all there,
to the pound.

1265
01:26:49,636 --> 01:26:51,842
- And they were gonna pay?
- Looks like it.

1266
01:26:51,972 --> 01:26:54,843
But who knows?
The opportunity was there.

1267
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:57,921
In my experience it's best
to take that opportunity -

1268
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:00,076
if it's there.

1269
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:02,540
Good work, Chris.

1270
01:27:09,714 --> 01:27:11,141
We've got to get those guns.

1271
01:27:11,335 --> 01:27:13,934
This is dangerous shit there.
We don't even know who lives there.

1272
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,926
Listen, I don't care who lives there!

1273
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:19,638
All's I know is that it's preferable
to death by Hatchet.

1274
01:27:19,638 --> 01:27:22,644
Fair enough. Let's go.

1275
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,169
I don't think
it's the right move.

1276
01:27:48,936 --> 01:27:49,894
It's either that

1277
01:27:50,094 --> 01:27:53,518
the old boy's place
and we lose a digit daily.

1278
01:27:54,342 --> 01:27:57,162
- I'm gonna phone him.
- As if he'll care.

1279
01:27:57,162 --> 01:28:00,172
He'll care, all right? That was
supposed to be his money.

1280
01:28:00,356 --> 01:28:02,409
Whether he cares about us
or not, is different.

1281
01:28:02,609 --> 01:28:04,502
Pass me the phone.

1282
01:28:20,144 --> 01:28:22,945
Yeah? That you, boy?

1283
01:28:23,045 --> 01:28:25,041
It's Ed,
if that's what you mean.

1284
01:28:25,492 --> 01:28:27,213
'Pay day, ain't it?'

1285
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:30,907
Yeah...l wanted
to talk to you about that.

1286
01:28:31,007 --> 01:28:32,833
I'll bet you do.

1287
01:28:32,926 --> 01:28:34,524
I got half
a million nicker sitting here,

1288
01:28:34,904 --> 01:28:36,967
which means
some poor sod doesn't.

1289
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,595
You've been upsetin' a few people, boy.

1290
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:43,435
But that really
isn't my concern, is it?

1291
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:47,412
What does concern me...
is the guns you had.

1292
01:28:47,814 --> 01:28:49,502
'l want to talk to you
about that.'

1293
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:53,784
So get your arse over here now.
And I do mean now!

1294
01:29:28,968 --> 01:29:33,768
Bastard! You fucking bastard!

1295
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:45,410
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1296
01:29:46,445 --> 01:29:50,416
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1297
01:30:01,306 --> 01:30:04,672
Job well done. We made
a few quid out of that one.

1298
01:30:05,245 --> 01:30:06,537
Son...?

1299
01:30:06,137 --> 01:30:08,238
Made a few quid, did you?

1300
01:30:08,643 --> 01:30:10,473
Where's what I want, now?

1301
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:13,162
You all right down there, mate?

1302
01:30:13,262 --> 01:30:16,357
Very fucking funny.
Where's what I want?

1303
01:30:17,215 --> 01:30:18,900
I've just left it in the office.

1304
01:30:19,071 --> 01:30:20,766
Well, we'd better go to the office and get it,

1305
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,692
that is if you want
your son to see his next birthday.

1306
01:30:23,792 --> 01:30:27,834
- Now chop-fucking-chop.
- All right. Fair enough.

1307
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:30,661
Where you going?

1308
01:30:31,374 --> 01:30:34,228
It's a thirty second drive
or a five minute walk.

1309
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:39,048
I couldn't have parked outside,
I'd have got a ticket.

1310
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:41,116
I suppose that don't
matter now, does it?

1311
01:30:41,216 --> 01:30:43,219
Just be careful.

1312
01:30:43,344 --> 01:30:44,971
Right.

1313
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,145
You and me.

1314
01:30:53,271 --> 01:30:54,031
You and who?

1315
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,365
You know where
the door handle is, Tom.

1316
01:30:59,373 --> 01:31:02,950
# "The Payback" #
by James Brown

1317
01:31:04,006 --> 01:31:05,674
# Pay back

1318
01:31:06,232 --> 01:31:09,787
# That's it, pay back.

1319
01:31:10,951 --> 01:31:13,583
# Revenge, I'm mad

1320
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:17,342
# Get down with my girlfriend

1321
01:31:18,631 --> 01:31:19,457
# That ain't right ##

1322
01:31:19,957 --> 01:31:22,300
Oh, no. Not again.

1323
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:40,484
That's it. I'm off.

1324
01:31:41,256 --> 01:31:45,323
Tom...that is our bag.

1325
01:32:03,507 --> 01:32:06,260
- Ed...!
- Hold on.

1326
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:20,711
This is our bag.

1327
01:32:23,183 --> 01:32:24,091
That's it. We're off.

1328
01:32:24,425 --> 01:32:27,394
- I'll see you in the car. I'm gonna take these guns.
- Tom, don't fuck about!

1329
01:32:27,394 --> 01:32:30,952
- I'll see you in the car.
- Tom !
- It'll only take a minute.

1330
01:32:46,135 --> 01:32:47,754
What is going on?

1331
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,161
I don't know, but what I do know
is there's no more Harry.

1332
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:55,591
Which means
there's no more debt.

1333
01:32:56,063 --> 01:32:59,487
And if there's no more debt,
there's no more problem.

1334
01:32:59,897 --> 01:33:03,474
And there's no problem with the
neighbours - because they're all dead.

1335
01:33:03,691 --> 01:33:07,002
And I think,
if I get this right,

1336
01:33:07,655 --> 01:33:11,203
we haven't done anything wrong
and we're in the clear.

1337
01:33:44,339 --> 01:33:46,191
Never ever...

1338
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:50,679
has anyone
been as fucking rude...

1339
01:33:51,095 --> 01:33:52,402
..to me...

1340
01:33:52,865 --> 01:33:57,997
...as you,   YOU... FUCKING... BASTARD!

1341
01:34:15,202 --> 01:34:16,911
You all right, mate?

1342
01:34:17,725 --> 01:34:20,394
Cheeky bastard!

1343
01:34:37,896 --> 01:34:40,780
'Now this was an embarrassing
position for Tom to be in.

1344
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,706
'But Chris had to respect
the fact that he was holding

1345
01:34:43,757 --> 01:34:46,320
'what appeared to be
a pair of loaded shotguns.

1346
01:34:46,835 --> 01:34:50,287
'And Tom had to respect the fact
that they were not loaded.

1347
01:34:50,463 --> 01:34:53,576
'So without anybody
losing too much face,

1350
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:05,935

I think your dad would like
a word with you, Ed.

1355
01:35:27,841 --> 01:35:28,866
Where are the others?

1356
01:35:29,175 --> 01:35:32,274
They got out yesterday.
They're back at the bar.

1360
01:35:47,666 --> 01:35:48,820
All right, Dad?

1361
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:51,058
I'm all right.
How about yourself?

1362
01:35:51,734 --> 01:35:55,948
I'm all right.
Could do with a drink, though.

1363
01:35:56,348 --> 01:35:58,942
All in good time. All in good time.

1364
01:35:59,447 --> 01:36:02,337
So, are you in the clear?

1365
01:36:02,538 --> 01:36:05,247
More importantly...am l?

1366
01:36:06,525 --> 01:36:07,899
It appears so.

1367
01:36:08,777 --> 01:36:13,829
Appears? You'll have to do
better than fucking appears, my friend.

1368
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:15,473
Well, everybody's dead, Dad.

1369
01:36:15,473 --> 01:36:17,852
I think that's about as clear
as it can get.

1370
01:36:19,013 --> 01:36:20,505
How about that drink?

1371
01:36:20,658 --> 01:36:22,306
You know where the bar is.

1372
01:36:22,406 --> 01:36:23,656
Eh?

1373
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:26,632
Don't make yourself
too comfortable.

1374
01:36:26,932 --> 01:36:29,815
Alan's got to sit there.
Alan!

1375
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,523
You're lucky
you're still breathing,

1376
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:36,977
Iet alone able to walk.

1377
01:36:37,554 --> 01:36:41,410
I suggest you take
full advantage of that fact.

1378
01:36:47,986 --> 01:36:51,453
# 'Cause I'm a man machine

1379
01:36:52,267 --> 01:36:54,417
# Takin' gasoline

1380
01:36:55,374 --> 01:36:57,293
# I'm a teen dream

1381
01:36:57,707 --> 01:36:59,309
# Super-human being

1382
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:02,389
# I'm a man machine

1383
01:37:02,473 --> 01:37:05,684
# I'm a man machine ! ##

1384
01:37:05,809 --> 01:37:09,241
You took your time.
Where the hell have you been?

1385
01:37:09,724 --> 01:37:11,420
Sit down. I'll tell you.

1386
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:21,344
The traffic warden identified
the neighbours' bodies.

1387
01:37:21,951 --> 01:37:24,912
Which sort of
puts us in the clear.

1388
01:37:25,037 --> 01:37:27,782
The only thing connecting us
with the case...

1389
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:29,760
..is those shotguns.

1390
01:37:29,938 --> 01:37:32,111
And Tom took care of them.

1391
01:37:33,278 --> 01:37:36,548
You did take care of the shotguns,
didn't you, Tom?

1392
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,840
I wanted to talk to you about that.

1393
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,297
Well, talk.

1394
01:37:42,423 --> 01:37:45,557
Well, actually...no.

1395
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:49,560
I've got them sittin' in the car,
I.. I was gonna sell 'em back to Nick the Greek,

1396
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:51,754
but I am having a bit of a problem
gettin' hold of him.

1397
01:37:52,054 --> 01:37:53,452
You dippy bastard.

1398
01:37:53,552 --> 01:37:59,585
So...the only thing
connecting us with the case

1399
01:37:59,895 --> 01:38:02,702
is in the back of your car,
which is parked outside!

1400
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:06,874
They costed 700 quid.
I'm not gonna throw 'em away.

1401
01:38:07,537 --> 01:38:10,531
And they're hardly likely to trace
'em back to us, are they?

1402
01:38:10,655 --> 01:38:13,619
Do you really think it's worth taking the
the risk for £700?

1403
01:38:13,819 --> 01:38:15,921
Tom, you're a dick!

1404
01:38:16,446 --> 01:38:18,952
Now you take those guns
and you throw 'em off a bridge.

1405
01:38:19,452 --> 01:38:21,531
And throw yourself off while you're at it.

1406
01:38:21,831 --> 01:38:23,617
Now.... Tom.

1407
01:38:28,082 --> 01:38:31,011
- Look, all I'm...
- Now, Tom !

1408
01:38:37,276 --> 01:38:39,236
Can I have a beer, please, Dad?

1409
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:41,822
I'm busy. Get it yourself.

1410
01:38:58,213 --> 01:39:01,008
It seemed Hatchet
underestimated you lot.

1411
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:03,599
And it seems to have cost him.

1412
01:39:04,527 --> 01:39:07,181
I ain't gonna make
the same mistake now, am l?

1413
01:39:08,106 --> 01:39:10,782
So I've decided
to bring your bag back.

1414
01:39:12,577 --> 01:39:16,393
I think the word you're looking
for, gentlemen, is "thank you".

1415
01:39:16,899 --> 01:39:18,650
Thank you.

1416
01:39:19,943 --> 01:39:22,529
Now you've presented me
with a problem.

1417
01:39:22,654 --> 01:39:24,990
I've lost my employer.

1418
01:39:26,533 --> 01:39:30,662
So I've taken care
of meself and me son.

1419
01:39:31,188 --> 01:39:35,012
Now if you think that's unfair,
you come and pay me a little visit.

1420
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,222
But you better be
waving a white flag,

1421
01:39:37,321 --> 01:39:41,047
high and clear
so as I can see it.

1422
01:39:41,454 --> 01:39:43,759
Or it'll be the last little visit 
you ever make.

1423
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:47,353
You understand ?

1424
01:39:48,669 --> 01:39:51,725
That's all I've come to say.

1425
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:55,437
There is one more thing...

1426
01:39:57,314 --> 01:39:59,566
It's been emotional.

1427
01:40:02,027 --> 01:40:05,114
# "Fool's Gold" #
by The Stone Roses

1428
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:19,920
# The gold road's
sure a long road

1429
01:40:20,045 --> 01:40:24,466
# Winds on through the hills
for fifteen days ##

1430
01:40:27,219 --> 01:40:31,390
We are now officially in
the money-lending business, all right, son?

1431
01:40:32,143 --> 01:40:33,684
Put your seatbelt on.

1432
01:40:34,309 --> 01:40:36,270
We're out of here.

1433
01:40:44,676 --> 01:40:46,905
It's empty.

1434
01:41:09,356 --> 01:41:13,285
# The pack on my back is aching

1435
01:41:13,689 --> 01:41:17,269
# The strap seems
to cut me like a knife

1436
01:41:28,865 --> 01:41:30,992
# I'm no clown
I won't back down

1437
01:41:30,992 --> 01:41:36,532
# I don't need you
to tell me what's going down...

1438
01:41:57,142 --> 01:41:59,561
What's his number?

1439
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:08,820
Don't! Don't! You'll jam the line!
I'll call him!

1440
01:42:16,078 --> 01:42:17,567
My fucking batteries!

1441
01:42:17,567 --> 01:42:21,291
- No, you muppet!
- Give me the phone! Give me the fucking phone!

1442
01:42:21,416 --> 01:42:23,710
- I'll dial it!
- Tell me the number!

1443
01:42:34,094 --> 01:42:38,642
- Now give me your phone!
- You'll break it!

1444
01:42:42,219 --> 01:42:44,918
- You give me the phone!
- You'll break it and it'll be fucked!

1445
01:42:44,918 --> 01:42:48,318
You shut it. It's fucking ringing!

1446
