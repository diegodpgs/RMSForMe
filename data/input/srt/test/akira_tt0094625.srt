1
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:45,264
"Haruki-ya."

2
00:01:57,615 --> 00:02:01,868
Groups of unemployed workers, who have
grown in number due to the tax reforms

3
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,205
enacted by the former Prime Minister,
are rioting all across the country.

4
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:08,750
And with the confusion among members
of Parliament sparked by the comments of.

5
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:12,253
Finance Minister Takanashi
during a recent Parliament inquiry,

6
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:16,758
there seems to be no compromise in sight
between the government and opposition.

7
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,635
Hey. What'll it be?

8
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:22,055
Give me three peanuts.

9
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:27,056
Let's see here...

10
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:43,614
We've herded those
Clown bastards onto Route 5.

11
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:46,955
Damn it, don't scare me like that!
Open the damn door quietly!

12
00:02:46,956 --> 00:02:51,956
You wouldn't be so jumpy if
you didn't have something to hide!

13
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:54,587
Try selling some normal
drinks sometime, huh?

14
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:58,716
How about buying something
for once?! This ain't a hangout!

15
00:02:58,717 --> 00:03:03,717
And drink that dog piss you sell?!

16
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:09,102
Twin ceramic rotor drives on each wheel...

17
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:14,103
And these are... Computer
controlled anti-lock brakes...

18
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:19,483
200 horsepower at 12,000 rpm...

19
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:22,490
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?

20
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:26,744
All right, let's go!

21
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:31,499
That bike's been customized just for me.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

22
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,004
I don't see how you can
ride something like that, man.

23
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:37,964
I could!

24
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:42,965
If you want one so bad,
steal a big one for yourself.

25
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,992
Unbelievable.

26
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:51,079
School kids these days...

27
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Wait! Hey, waiter!

28
00:04:56,835 --> 00:05:01,835
They ran into the alley! After 'em!

29
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:18,018
This isn't a game, you idiot!

30
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:19,443
Shit...!

31
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,341
That's..

32
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:28,092
This is car 375.

33
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:33,093
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of Highway 14 south!

34
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:38,102
Request immediate assistance!
Car 375, en route to the scene!

35
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:39,687
It's the cops! What should we do?

36
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:44,688
Damn, and my motor coils
were just getting warmed up...

37
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,614
Bastards...

38
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:51,699
Let's go, Tetsuo!

39
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,909
Right!

40
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,410
Damn!

41
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:07,215
A skirmish has broken out
between student protesters

42
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:10,218
and riot police assigned as security.
There appear to be some casualties.

43
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:15,219
Furthermore...

44
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:32,240
What the...?

45
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,866
What the hell's going on?!

46
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:38,867
Move it, jerk! I'm in a hurry!

47
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:53,386
What was that?!

48
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:58,387
Call the police!

49
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,270
Repeal the tax reforms!

50
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:25,998
This area is off-limits!
Go back! It's dangerous!

51
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:28,463
Something's strange here...

52
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,339
Let me through! I'm sorry, let me through!

53
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,340
What's the big idea?

54
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:41,976
Look! Blood!

55
00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:43,394
Who are they?

56
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:44,687
Excuse me... Hey! Don't push!

57
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:45,480
Excuse me.

58
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:50,481
HeY! Watch it. Jerk!

59
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:53,404
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

60
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:54,822
Ryu!

61
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:59,823
Hey! He ran away!

62
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:07,372
H°'$ 90t a gun!

63
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:13,090
Fire!

64
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:18,091
Hold your fire! There's a kid with him!

65
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:28,064
Run...

66
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:28,609
Hurry...

67
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:36,030
Go to Ryu...

68
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:41,031
Ryu will help you now...

69
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:47,621
Hurry... Get out of here...

70
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:20,992
Kei!

71
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:25,993
What are you doing? Hurry!

72
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:32,249
He vanished...!

73
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,219
He's to the west.

74
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,220
The west? He's in the old city, then.

75
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:54,804
Eat this!

76
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:08,414
Tetsuo!

77
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:30,349
"Closed: Beyond this point is
unrepaired, unrestored Old City area."

78
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:43,528
"Oppose Imperialism."

79
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:53,705
Ryu! Ryu. Where are you?

80
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:55,628
Kei!

81
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:27,906
No, that's...!

82
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:50,429
How you like that?!

83
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,899
Well? Who is it?

84
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,610
It's not him! It's not Tetsuo!

85
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:06,611
Okay! Let's go!

86
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:13,076
You little... What did you do...?

87
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:31,303
Tetsuo! Hang on! Hey!

88
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:32,892
Huh? What did you say?

89
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:37,563
That kid...

90
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:40,399
He's hurt bad!

91
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,819
Hey! Wait!

92
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,904
We gotta get him to a hospital!

93
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:49,905
He needs an ambulance!
...We can't move him!

94
00:13:58,043 --> 00:14:03,043
W-What the hell?!

95
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:19,226
There's no escape.

96
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:27,651
We've come for you.

97
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:35,242
We can't survive on the outside.
Come on, let's go home.

98
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:43,583
It's the army! Those are army helicopters!

99
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:48,538
Move out!

100
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:02,356
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

101
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:05,276
Um... We're just, uh...

102
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:10,277
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

103
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,415
Ow... Damn it, that hurts!

104
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:19,916
Kai!

105
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,423
Hey!

106
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:28,591
Sir?

107
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:29,466
Who are they?

108
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:34,467
They seem to be an ordinary bike gang, sir.

109
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:50,446
We're going back.

110
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,239
Ow! Hey, wait a minute!

111
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,241
My arms don't bend that way, damn it!

112
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:57,453
Load the wounded onto the helicopter!

113
00:15:57,454 --> 00:15:58,579
Tetsuo!

114
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,165
Wait! Where are you taking him?

115
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,917
Kaneda!

116
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:06,086
What the hell? We didn't do anything!

117
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:11,087
He's heavy...!

118
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:53,672
"Tokyo Olympics"
"147 Days to the Opening Ceremonies."

119
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:55,844
"Student ID."

120
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:56,887

"Kaneda."

"The Student's Ten Moral Precepts."

122
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:13,024
So you and your friends went out at night
on your bikes to visit your dying mother,

123
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:18,242
and a group of hooligans called
the Clowns picked a fight with you.

124
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:20,703
They hurt your friend,
so you lost your temper,

125
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:24,456
which is why eight Clown
members are now in the hospital.

126
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,792
That's your story?

127
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:29,461
She's cute!

128
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,921
Hey! You can't look at this!

129
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,506
And how's your mother doing?!

130
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:33,882
Huh? Oh.

131
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,510
Luckily, she made it
through the worst of it last night.

132
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:41,511
And I suppose she's made it over
the mountains on a bike by now?

133
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,438
It couldn't be these bozos.

134
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,314
You can tell that just by looking.

135
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:50,899
"♪8 interrogation Room"

136
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,861
Wait on that bench. Understand?

137
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:56,613
How much longer are
we gonna have to wait?

138
00:17:56,614 --> 00:18:01,118
Okay! The next five, come get in here!

139
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,119
So the army's working with the police to
hunt down anti-government groups now, huh?

140
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,630
Wanna put up a fight, huh?
...He's holding something!

141
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:22,056
Bastard!

142
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:27,057
Long live the freedom revolution!

143
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:32,812
He's got a grenade!

144
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Crazy son of a bitch!

145
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:48,207
All right, that's enough! Take him away!

146
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,250
We'll really teach him a lesson later.

147
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:54,088
You dumb bastard! If you wanna die,
just hang yourself or something!

148
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:58,842
Hey! You people can go.
We've contacted your school.

149
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:00,219
What? You son of a...

150
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,721
Hey, hold on a minute, pops!

151
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:04,306
II Pop$II?!

152
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:06,391
There was one more of us.

153
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:07,434
What?

154
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:12,435
Pardon me.

155
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:13,857
What're you...

156
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:16,276
This is her. Can she leave with us?

157
00:19:16,277 --> 00:19:19,113
Who are you calling "Pops," you punk?

158
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:20,405
Owg.

159
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:25,119
Look here, kid! I'm only 25!
I'm not even married!

160
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,120
So watch your mouth! She can go with you!

161
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,085
Call a doctor!

162
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:37,798
So I think the army was chasing
that weird kid Kaneda saw...

163
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,883
I think I saw him, too.

164
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:41,593
And what about Tetsuo?

165
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:44,179
Why the hell wouldn't they
tell us what hospital he's in?

166
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,764
What did you saY?!

167
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:49,309
I was just wondering if you wanted to
grab some tea or something over there.

168
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,310
I figured we could have a nice,
long talk about that "revolution" deal.

169
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:59,069
Skirt-chasers will try
anything these days...

170
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,989
You'll help anyone so
long as they're a girl, won't you?

171
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,908
No way! I have high standards!

172
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:07,911
It's not their looks that count.

173
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:11,915
It's their... I dunno, their
sensitivity that moves me.

174
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:16,253
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...

175
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:17,754
I'm Kaneda. Nice to meet you.

176
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:20,299
See you around, Kaneda.

177
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,218
You're leaving already? Don't be like that!

178
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:28,219
Hey, come on! I did save you and all!

179
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:36,815
At least tell me your name, you bitch!

180
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:41,236
I'll try talking with them for
the time being, but it's risky.

181
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:46,237
If they think you're trying to avoid taking
responsibility, it'll blow up in your face.

182
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:50,412
I can't believe that there's a
mole on the executive council.

183
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,164
Even if that's true...

184
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:54,208
That isn't important.

185
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:58,670
What's important is diplomacy and political
maneuvering, which you seem to despise.

186
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:01,089
I never studied them in school, you see.

187
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,051
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting,

188
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:09,052
your poor management of this last
incident will be called into question.

189
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:17,356
There's a phone call for the Colonel.

190
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:22,357
You should put your affairs in order.

191
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:24,073
It's me.

192
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:48,720
This way, Colonel.

193
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,973
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,

194
00:21:50,974 --> 00:21:55,974
but there's something you really must see.

195
00:21:58,314 --> 00:21:59,815
Please observe.

196
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:03,068
It's the special pattern
from that young boy.

197
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:05,279
It doesn't resemble any I've seen so far,

198
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,407
and I've never seen a developmental
speed or configuration like this.

199
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:13,078
It may have begun with the shock of
contact with Number 26, or possibly...

200
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,747
Have you finished running a
comparison with Akira's pattern?

201
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:20,748
I'll superimpose it over this one.

202
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:27,422
This projection was constructed using
mixed data, so a comparison is difficult,

203
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:32,097
but I believe this boy's
pattern is the key to solving

204
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:35,058
the riddle of Akira's
pattern growth process.

205
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,852
All right. Continue.

206
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:38,562
Very well, sir. Thank you.

207
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:43,563
I'm sure he'll turn out to be a
worthy addition to the Numbers.

208
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,569
It may be rough on him,

209
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,114
but I thought we might try
starting him off with level 7 capsules.

210
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:50,407
Is it safe?

211
00:22:50,408 --> 00:22:51,658
Leave everything to me.

212
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,910
That's not what I meant!

213
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:58,911
I'm asking that if he turns out to
have power like Akira's like you said,

214
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:02,419
will we be able to control it?

215
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,755
Well, that's...

216
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:06,590
Can I leave this to you?

217
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:11,591
Well, if we use the latest examination
equipment to collect even more data

218
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:17,055
and do a multifaceted
analysis, then surely...

219
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:22,522
Maybe we shouldn't touch that power.

220
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:27,523
The power of God?

221
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,739
A... ki... ra...

222
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,740
But we have to. We have
to touch it and control it.

223
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:40,749
If it looks like it's too much for us
to handle, terminate him at once!

224
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,584
There can be no hesitation!

225
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:44,294
Very well, Colonel.

226
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:49,295
"Ward 8 Vocational Training School"
Very well, Colonel.

227
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:56,723
And can't adapt to living in a group,
screw up here, it's the end of the road!

228
00:23:56,724 --> 00:24:00,394
Even if you're under 15, if you get more
than 50 penalty points on your record,

229
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,729
you're sent to the regular courts!

230
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,232
Bite me! Don't mess with us, you bald goat!

231
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,858
Aren't any of you listening?

232
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:09,444
You lost me halfway through!
...Discipline!

233
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:10,737
Discipline!

234
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:12,072
Discipline! ...Ow!

235
00:24:12,073 --> 00:24:14,574
Discipline! Discipline!

236
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:15,951
Discipline!

237
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:17,869
Dismissed!

238
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,582
Thank you very much, sir!

239
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,919
You bastard! You and me are
gonna go at it someday, jack!

240
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,003
We're gonna remember this!

241
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:28,213
I hope you rot and die!

242
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:29,965
You sick bastard!

243
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:30,466
Shit...

244
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:38,348
Yamagata!

245
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,267
What happened to your cheek?

246
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:41,601
Shut the hell up.

247
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:43,562
Let me guess, Jaws from P.E.?

248
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:46,481
They say you fought the
Clowns on a highway in the old city!

249
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:46,898
Yeah.

250
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:50,235
Why don't you just wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross!

251
00:24:50,236 --> 00:24:51,862
And last night...

252
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:53,864
There were demonstrators,
cops, and even the damn army!

253
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:55,907
And that idiot Tetsuo had an accident, too.

254
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:57,576
What happened to Tetsuo?

255
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:59,578
He's in the hospital.
I guess, but we don't know where.

256
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:04,579
The idiot was trying to show off.

257
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,209
That idiot...

258
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,211
What, you mean Tetsuo?

259
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:11,214
Shut up! I've had enough
of your damn flirting!

260
00:25:11,215 --> 00:25:16,215
What's gotten into you?!

261
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:33,069
Tetsuo? It's time for your medication.

262
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:38,070
Doctor! There's a problem!

263
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:44,581
I can't. The dorm mother
throws a fit if you go out before 10.

264
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:47,542
Yeah, the one with the face like a goat.

265
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:51,588
That old bag's such a pain...
She's always yammering on and on and on.

266
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:54,341
Tomorrow at three? Sure, that'd be okay.

267
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:57,719
Hey, what happened
to that girl a while back?

268
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,723
I don't like her much.
Her personality just gets on my nerves.

269
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:05,227
Kaori...

270
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:07,103
Tetsuo!

271
00:26:07,104 --> 00:26:12,104
Everyone's been worried about you!
They thought you might be dead.

272
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,577
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

273
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:24,788
And that examination...

274
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:29,334
It's like... they were messing
around inside my head.

275
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:32,003
I don't want to go back there.

276
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:33,713
Let's run away...

277
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:36,508
Where?

278
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:41,509
Someplace. Someplace far away.

279
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:45,976
"What's your problem?
That's mine!"

280
00:26:45,977 --> 00:26:47,060
I wanna get laid!

281
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:49,062
Hey! Today's independent study!

282
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:54,063
Say what? What about
my burning desire to study?!

283
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,112
Drag his butt in here!

284
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:59,072
Kaneda! Your bike!

285
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:01,908
My bike?

286
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:02,409
Look!

287
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:10,250
Tetsuo!

288
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:11,501
Are you sure this is okay?

289
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:16,502
Shut up! Just keep quiet and hang on!

290
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:22,425
"Off Limits."

291
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:26,057
Huh?

292
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:29,603
What's wrong?

293
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:30,729
Shit!

294
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,342
Oh, no...

295
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,574
My butt hurts.
...Okay, I get it...

296
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:45,118
Look, bikes!

297
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,078
Is that Kaneda and...?

298
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:52,079
It's not them!

299
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:52,918
Kaori!

300
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,757
Any sign of him?

301
00:27:58,758 --> 00:28:01,009
Kuwata and the others
went to look around Kisarazu.

302
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,928
All that's left now is the industrial area!

303
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:08,725
Okay, let's go!

304
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:13,726
We owe you for the other night!

305
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:24,699
Shut up!

306
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Kaori! What did they do, Kaori?!

307
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:38,751
Don't! If you so much as scratch
that bike, I'm gonna kill you!

308
00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:46,096
Run!

309
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:51,097
Don't let 'em get away!

310
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:54,855
Wait!

311
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:05,657
Tetsuo!

312
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:18,124
"Smash the Strike!!"

313
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:26,219
That's enough, Tetsuo!
Are you trying to kill him?

314
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,264
Yes! I'm gonna kill him!
I'll split his damn head open!

315
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:31,057
Knock it off!

316
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:35,145
This happened because
you took my bike for a joyride.

317
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:36,062
Enough, already!

318
00:29:36,063 --> 00:29:39,858
Shut up! Don't order me around!

319
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:41,568
We were worried about you.

320
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:45,488
Why do you always have
to come and save me?

321
00:29:45,489 --> 00:29:50,076
I could've handled it myself!
I admit I got beat up that one time,

322
00:29:50,077 --> 00:29:53,913
but I won't always be on the receiving end!

323
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:58,914
Understand?!

324
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:02,630
Tetsuo...

325
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:07,010
Shut up! Stay away from me!

326
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:10,722
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

327
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:14,392
Leave me alone!

328
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:14,893
Akira!

329
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,190
Tetsuo!

330
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:26,112
What's wrong?

331
00:30:26,113 --> 00:30:27,238
Akira!

332
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:32,239
I don't know who that is!

333
00:30:51,597 --> 00:30:53,973
Tetsuo, are you...

334
00:30:53,974 --> 00:30:54,474
Hey!

335
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,481
This is strange.

336
00:31:01,482 --> 00:31:04,567
I'm getting a blue pattern on scope ♪3!

337
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:09,568
Oh, no! Retrieve the subject! Hurry!

338
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,460
What're you doing to my friend?!

339
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:32,550
What's with you?
You just come back from a funeral?

340
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:39,686
Tetsuo!

341
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:42,438
Kaneda!

342
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:42,939
Shit...

343
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:53,825
Wait!

344
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:06,417
Hey, Kaneda...

345
00:32:14,847 --> 00:32:19,847
I see we have some youngsters doing their
thing in spite of the tight checkpoints.

346
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:25,352
That just means that
they're stupid, don't it?

347
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:31,654
This is boring. Hey, let's go home.

348
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,364
But it's still early!

349
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:37,368
Yeah, but without their bikes
they're just skirt-chasers out of water.

350
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:38,578
You mean "fish"!

351
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:42,123
Come on, let's go. Let's
toss these fish back!

352
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:47,124
Hey, Kaneda, what're we gonna do?

353
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:49,631
What the...?

354
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:50,132
Look!

355
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:18,576
That's...

356
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:22,538
Here we go again... Let's get out
of here before we get involved again.

357
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:24,499
Huh?

358
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,625
Kaneda?

359
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:28,252
Hey!

360
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:32,548
This area is being cordoned
off due to a terrorist bombing.

361
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,509
Those who wish to get
through, line up in single file,

362
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:39,510
present your ID and go
through the Checkpoint.

363
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,857
Get in.

364
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:54,028
What's wrong? Hurry. I'll
be right behind you.

365
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:57,031
You know the rendezvous point, right?

366
00:33:57,032 --> 00:34:02,032
Be careful... You too, Ryu.

367
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:12,042
Ilwel re the CIOVVHS...

368
00:34:13,507 --> 00:34:17,885
Stop! Stop. Damn it!

369
00:34:17,886 --> 00:34:22,886
She's 90t a gun!

370
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:33,151
Okay, that's far enough!

371
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:38,152
D"°P the gun!

372
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:46,827
Drop it now!

373
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:49,876
Stop!

374
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,476
I think it came from over here!

375
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:08,311
There were two shots!
...No, three!

376
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:10,063
It's just up ahead!

377
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:12,899
Hey. Let's get out of here.

378
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,444
Come on!

379
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:46,887
"Idiot I Moron I Fool I No. 1."

380
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:21,051
Kaneda!

381
00:36:47,578 --> 00:36:51,747
So, what's the matter?
Try telling me about it.

382
00:36:51,748 --> 00:36:54,584
I had a dream.

383
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:57,753
A dream?

384
00:36:57,754 --> 00:37:02,754
The city will be covered by a
dark shadow and start to crumble.

385
00:37:02,926 --> 00:37:05,511
Lots of people died...

386
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:09,891
and we met Akira again.

387
00:37:09,892 --> 00:37:11,267
Akira?!

388
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:16,268
The city will crumble,
and so many people will die...

389
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:22,361
When?! When will it happen, Kiyoko?!

390
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:25,406
You mustn't let that boy go.

391
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:30,407
His power, it...

392
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,083
What did she mean?!

393
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:41,084
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

394
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:43,549
Her medication is normal. Too.

395
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:48,221
There's no sign of any abnormalities
in her ECG or EEG, either.

396
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:53,222
I think what Number 25 said
was her precognitive power at work.

397
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:58,814
This must be presented to the supreme
executive council for inquiry, but...

398
00:37:58,815 --> 00:38:00,691
Do you believe her?

399
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:03,152
I have no doubts
regarding Number 25's abilities.

400
00:38:03,153 --> 00:38:06,072
We have all sorts of data
that substantiate her abilities.

401
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:08,783
What about you, Colonel?

402
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:13,784
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve.
It's to act or not to act.

403
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:27,009
Here, sir.

404
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,010
Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You, too, Doctor.

405
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:47,363
The other day, a young
researcher asked me something.

406
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:51,534
He wondered if their power was the form the
next stage of human evolution was taking,

407
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:56,535
and perhaps that we'll all
be able to control it someday.

408
00:38:57,124 --> 00:39:00,084
Scientists are a bunch of romantics.

409
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:03,254
Military men always
consider the risks first.

410
00:39:03,255 --> 00:39:05,881
It's taken thirty long years.

411
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:09,927
We've come so far from the rubble.

412
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:12,096
We can't just trade one for the other.

413
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:16,892
I've always thought that
you hated this city, Colonel.

414
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:21,893
The passion to build has cooled
and the joy of reconstruction forgotten,

415
00:39:22,357 --> 00:39:26,319
and now it's just a garbage heap
made up of hedonistic fools.

416
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,239
So you're trying to save the city, then.

417
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,240
It's how a soldier thinks.
A scientist wouldn't understand.

418
00:39:37,497 --> 00:39:39,749
Colonel, we're here.

419
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:44,750
This way, sir.

420
00:40:01,229 --> 00:40:04,982
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.

421
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:07,735
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.

422
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:12,323
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance, check.

423
00:40:12,324 --> 00:40:15,201
Emergency power generator, check.

424
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:16,243
Open it.

425
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:17,661
Yes, sir.

426
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:18,162
Uh...

427
00:40:18,163 --> 00:40:19,497
Go to the Control Room!

428
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:20,110
Yes, sir!

429
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:42,432
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.
It's within tolerances.

430
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,480
No abnormalities detected in any of the
rooms' Dewar Walls or in the defense system.

431
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:52,405
No abnormal atmospheric
concentrations or reactions recorded.

432
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:57,406
All systems nominal, then?

433
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:07,586
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic. They were afraid!

434
00:41:07,587 --> 00:41:10,131
They were too scared,
so they hid it away from the public.

435
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:12,550
They forgot all shame and honor

436
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:17,096
and cast off the civilization
and science we had created,

437
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:22,097
and shut the lid of the Pandora's Box
they themselves had opened.

438
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:26,897
Ryu!

439
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:29,233
Hey, we're still young.

440
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:31,902
I think we can start over.

441
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:33,320
I'll go with you to the police.

442
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:34,280
Ryu!

443
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:35,906
Come on, turn yourself in!

444
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:38,159
That was the first time you
ever killed somebody, right?

445
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,826
Ryu!

446
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:41,787
Anyway, once you've
purified your body and soul,

447
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:44,165
let's go out for tea or something.

448
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,333
Don't kick yourself over it, okay?

449
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:51,334
What's done is done. The guy's dead.

450
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,597
Who're you?!

451
00:41:59,598 --> 00:42:02,308
RYU! You're okay!

452
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:05,227
Kei, is that you? ...Ryu!

453
00:42:05,228 --> 00:42:07,396
Who's this?

454
00:42:07,397 --> 00:42:08,939
Who, me?

455
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,940
Well, I guess saying I'm Kei's
boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.

456
00:42:15,113 --> 00:42:18,699
But we haven't gotten physical
or anything yet, understand?

457
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,783
Are You a s HNO! Py?!

458
00:42:19,784 --> 00:42:20,284
Liar!

459
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:27,458
Is he really okay?

460
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:31,045
All I know for sure is that he's not a spy.

461
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:34,215
Ow...

462
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:36,425
Sneak into their lab?!

463
00:42:36,426 --> 00:42:39,053
Are you serious? Don't you
remember the fiasco with that kid?!

464
00:42:39,054 --> 00:42:44,054
Last-minute orders.
Besides, the plan's already in place.

465
00:42:45,685 --> 00:42:48,646
The lab passes that they
issue once a week...

466
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:50,689
They're from Mr. Nezu?

467
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,149
What's the objective?

468
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,944
Detailed data on the new subject.

469
00:42:54,945 --> 00:42:56,570
New subject?

470
00:42:56,571 --> 00:43:01,571
Yes. Last week, on the night we tried
to abduct the subject called Number 26,

471
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:08,582
a boy who was in an accident on an
old city highway was brought to the lab.

472
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,210
Looks like he's a student
at a vocational training school.

473
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:16,211
But he's now their new subject
for human experimentation.

474
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:19,802
Owg.

475
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:23,389
Ow! What's the big idea?!

476
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,390
You!

477
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:25,975
He heard us! Let's kill him!

478
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:26,725
Ryu!

479
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:30,771
W-Wait a minute! Listen to me!
Listen to what I have to say!

480
00:43:30,772 --> 00:43:31,897
He saved me!

481
00:43:31,898 --> 00:43:33,232
Twice!

482
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:35,317
Maybe it was just to get close to us.

483
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:38,904
The guy who was in that accident
in the old city is a friend of mine!

484
00:43:38,905 --> 00:43:42,074
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's the truth!

485
00:43:42,075 --> 00:43:44,868
I was there when it happened!

486
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:48,914
Don't they say the only foolish
questions are unasked ones?

487
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:52,835
Huh? They don't?

488
00:43:52,836 --> 00:43:56,046
That's an intriguing story.

489
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:59,049
Will you be taking the boy with you?

490
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:03,804
He knows the subject, and I think
we can use him as a decoy if necessary.

491
00:44:03,805 --> 00:44:07,766
Neo Tokyo is going to change.

492
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:12,767
In all respects, this city is
saturated. It's like an overripe fruit.

493
00:44:13,023 --> 00:44:15,858
And within it is a new seed.

494
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:20,029
We only need to wait for
the wind which will make it fall.

495
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,198
The wind called Akira!

496
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,869
Ryu. Look!

497
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,953
What is it?

498
00:44:27,954 --> 00:44:30,664
We aren't the ones who will change it,

499
00:44:30,665 --> 00:44:34,877
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira will.

500
00:44:34,878 --> 00:44:38,714
That which is called
science perverts providence!

501
00:44:38,715 --> 00:44:43,715
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!

502
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:50,726
The time of atonement is upon us!

503
00:44:50,727 --> 00:44:55,727
The time of his awakening is nigh!

504
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:07,451
Terrorist activities carried out by

505
00:45:07,452 --> 00:45:11,080
anti-government elements
have skyrocketed this month.

506
00:45:11,081 --> 00:45:15,334
The army, riot police, and even
traffic police have been fully mobilized.

507
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:18,754
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.

508
00:45:18,755 --> 00:45:21,173
And then there's the
abduction of Number 26!

509
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:24,385
Isn't their existence supposed
to be highest of state secrets?

510
00:45:24,386 --> 00:45:27,971
No one's ever heard of "Peace
and Order" here in Neo Tokyo, then?

511
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:31,558
And then there's this request of yours

512
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,559
for further funding because
of subject Number 25's prediction.

513
00:45:36,606 --> 00:45:38,190
You must be joking!

514
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:43,191
We Parliament members have been
begging the public to bear with us

515
00:45:43,488 --> 00:45:48,488
while we straighten out the former Prime
Minister's historic tax reform blunders,

516
00:45:48,785 --> 00:45:51,912
so where, exactly, are we
supposed to get that kind of money?!

517
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:56,625
You've spent a fortune, and all we have to
show for it is that grotesque kindergarten!

518
00:45:56,626 --> 00:45:59,253
The Olympics are next year.
The postwar period is over.

519
00:45:59,254 --> 00:46:02,923
How much longer will you keep
spending money on some ghost?!

520
00:46:02,924 --> 00:46:06,135
I always said that we should've put
that money into the welfare program!

521
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:07,302
Shut up, old man!

522
00:46:07,303 --> 00:46:08,303
What?!

523
00:46:08,304 --> 00:46:12,182
That power is starting to
walk around free as we speak.

524
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:17,183
Unless we control it now, we'll lose everything!
...Who do you think you're talking to, youngster?

525
00:46:17,772 --> 00:46:20,816
It was your lack of policy that
started this mess in the first place!

526
00:46:20,817 --> 00:46:25,446
There's still no proof that the
last World War was caused by Akira!

527
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:29,575
Won't you even try to
understand anything at all

528
00:46:29,576 --> 00:46:31,577
unless an Akira disaster actually happens?!

529
00:46:31,578 --> 00:46:34,163
Has anyone actually seen this "Akira"?

530
00:46:34,164 --> 00:46:36,457
Wasn't Akira Number 25?

531
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,751
No, I think he was Number 21...

532
00:46:38,752 --> 00:46:42,671
The Colonel has lost
sight of his duty as a soldier.

533
00:46:42,672 --> 00:46:45,007
I've had reports that
anti-government elements are using

534
00:46:45,008 --> 00:46:50,008
this "Akira" madness of yours as an
excuse to whip up their terrorist fervor!

535
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:53,015
No! That's untrue!

536
00:46:53,016 --> 00:46:55,642
Then what about that
Akira world renewal movement?

537
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:57,728
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

538
00:46:57,729 --> 00:47:01,231
World renewal movement?
End of the world, more like!

539
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:05,110
Aren't you just using Akira as
camouflage to cover up your misconduct?

540
00:47:05,111 --> 00:47:06,945
What are you getting at?

541
00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:11,946
Colonel, we can no longer leave the
peace of Neo Tokyo to your sole discretion.

542
00:47:15,663 --> 00:47:16,622
Right!

543
00:47:16,623 --> 00:47:20,042
You are to be put before
an inquiry Committee.

544
00:47:20,043 --> 00:47:20,543
Iagree!

545
00:47:25,048 --> 00:47:26,882
Excuse me!

546
00:47:26,883 --> 00:47:29,009
Colonel! Colonel, where are you...

547
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,678
Wait! This discussion isn't over yet!

548
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:32,971
Explain yourself!

549
00:47:32,972 --> 00:47:36,225
Are you trying to insult the
supreme executive council?!

550
00:47:36,226 --> 00:47:37,184
Colonel...!

551
00:47:37,185 --> 00:47:42,185
Wait, Colonel!

552
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:05,667
W-Water...

553
00:48:35,285 --> 00:48:37,578
Hey, wait a minute...

554
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:41,206
isn't that cable replacement
scheduled for next week?

555
00:48:41,207 --> 00:48:44,751
The cable they ordered came in early.

556
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:49,752
Besides, I'm going on vacation
at the end of the week.

557
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:57,260
I could take it back, but the
work's gonna be done sooner or later.

558
00:49:01,936 --> 00:49:06,936
Okay, let's go.

559
00:50:34,112 --> 00:50:39,112
What the...?

560
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:05,559
Milk?

561
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:19,527
Stay aWaY!

562
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:30,042
Blood!

563
00:51:30,043 --> 00:51:35,043
I'm scared!

564
00:51:40,178 --> 00:51:42,179
Jerk!

565
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:47,180
W-Who the hell are they?

566
00:52:39,862 --> 00:52:43,698
Room 887, Tetsuo Shima...

567
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:48,699
A problem with the automatic lock?

568
00:52:50,873 --> 00:52:55,873
Hey! You can't just walk
off from your room!

569
00:52:58,923 --> 00:53:00,507
Come on, let's go back.

570
00:53:00,508 --> 00:53:05,508
What the hell happened? What a mess!

571
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:30,495
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.

572
00:53:30,496 --> 00:53:35,041
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.

573
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:38,503
That's probably the place.

574
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:41,173
The central wiring shaft
should be up ahead.

575
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:45,218
We should be able to use it
to go straight to the sublevels.

576
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:48,513
Be careful. It's deeper in the middle.

577
00:53:48,514 --> 00:53:50,098
What a stink!

578
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:50,974
Quiet!

579
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:54,186
What? I said it stinks because it stinks!

580
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:58,481
Is your nose busted?
...Hurry up and stay quiet!

581
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:01,151
Damn! Hide!

582
00:54:01,152 --> 00:54:02,569
Huh? Where?

583
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:07,570
What're you doing, you idiot?!

584
00:54:18,544 --> 00:54:20,212
They left?

585
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:21,880
Looks like they've beefed up security.

586
00:54:21,881 --> 00:54:23,632
Must be that siren we heard.

587
00:54:23,633 --> 00:54:25,091
What should we do? Scout around some?

588
00:54:25,092 --> 00:54:26,593
No.

589
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:27,844
Are you okay?
...Let's keep going.

590
00:54:27,845 --> 00:54:30,347
I want to check out their
security at the very least.

591
00:54:30,348 --> 00:54:31,514
All right.

592
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:34,392
We've been spotted! Run!

593
00:54:34,393 --> 00:54:35,685
Shit!

594
00:54:35,686 --> 00:54:40,686
Don't! Don't shoot!

595
00:54:41,192 --> 00:54:45,111
Shimazaki! Shit!

596
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:50,112
Forget about him! Run!

597
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,745
What the hell is that?

598
00:54:53,746 --> 00:54:55,914
Here it comes!

599
00:54:55,915 --> 00:55:00,915
Forget it! You can't do any good!

600
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:05,674
Die!

601
00:55:05,675 --> 00:55:07,342
This is Unit 304, Shaft H!

602
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:11,721
I have encountered intruders
and am engaging! Request backup!

603
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:16,722
Here it comes!

604
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:43,128
Kei!

605
00:55:43,129 --> 00:55:44,963
Where's that gun?!

606
00:55:44,964 --> 00:55:49,259
Damn it...!

607
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:49,760
Kaneda!

608
00:56:00,688 --> 00:56:03,440
Kei, this way!

609
00:56:03,441 --> 00:56:06,693
Hurry!

610
00:56:06,694 --> 00:56:11,694
Kaneda, hurry!

611
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:24,670
Kaneda!

612
00:56:38,642 --> 00:56:40,852
The brakes! Where are the brakes?!

613
00:56:40,853 --> 00:56:42,103
That's not it?

614
00:56:42,104 --> 00:56:44,105
This is the central wiring shaft!

615
00:56:44,106 --> 00:56:49,106
It's gotta be this one, then!

616
00:56:51,947 --> 00:56:54,949
Okay, I'm getting the hang of this!

617
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,243
Ask the Colonel for clearance to fire!

618
00:56:57,244 --> 00:56:59,371
Turn that up!

619
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:00,872
There must be some mistake.

620
00:57:00,873 --> 00:57:03,583
That boy looks like the
patient they admitted to the lab.

621
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:06,961
The boy, the subject named
Tetsuo Shima, broke out of his room.

622
00:57:06,962 --> 00:57:09,005
I think he's headed for the Baby Room.

623
00:57:09,006 --> 00:57:10,173
Tetsuo?!

624
00:57:10,174 --> 00:57:13,093
He is in an extremely dangerous
state! Don't let him through!

625
00:57:13,094 --> 00:57:18,094
I repeat, do not let him through!

626
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:48,916
What the...?

627
00:57:52,675 --> 00:57:54,509
It's no use hiding.

628
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,678
We have no choice, then. Use your guns!

629
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:01,015
We can't let him go any
farther, no matter what it takes!

630
00:58:01,016 --> 00:58:01,516
Fire!

631
00:58:42,016 --> 00:58:47,016
So, here you are...

632
00:58:49,857 --> 00:58:53,359
St°P it!

633
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,360
How long are you
gonna keep playing around?!

634
00:59:03,078 --> 00:59:06,539
Where'd the other one go?

635
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,292
Why, you...

636
00:59:09,293 --> 00:59:13,171
Die!

637
00:59:13,172 --> 00:59:13,672
Takashü.

638
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:29,850
What the hell is going on?
Am I dreaming or something?

639
00:59:30,189 --> 00:59:35,189
I never knew I had powers like this!

640
00:59:40,616 --> 00:59:43,201
Damn it, which way should I go?!

641
00:59:43,202 --> 00:59:46,829
Straight. Straight ahead...

642
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,914
Huh?

643
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:51,960
There's a freight elevator.

644
00:59:51,961 --> 00:59:56,961
We can take it to sublevel 8.

645
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:07,267
Good, you're all together.

646
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:10,937
You thought you could kill me?

647
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:15,938
You tried to mess with me...
I'm gonna kill you!

648
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:23,199
That was you...

649
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,659
Takashü.

650
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,703
Attack him together!

651
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:27,204
O-Okay.

652
01:00:33,168 --> 01:00:38,168
You little twerps!

653
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,520
That's enough! All of you!

654
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:06,530
Who the hell are you?!

655
01:01:06,994 --> 01:01:10,371
What's the matter?
Does your head hurt, Tetsuo Shima?

656
01:01:10,372 --> 01:01:12,373
Your power isn't fully matured.

657
01:01:12,374 --> 01:01:14,709
If you push yourself,
you might do irreparable damage.

658
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,878
Just do as we tell you.

659
01:01:16,879 --> 01:01:21,879
What the hell did you
people do to my head?!

660
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,310
Calm yourself, Tetsuo Shima!

661
01:01:32,311 --> 01:01:37,311
He can't control it.

662
01:01:39,443 --> 01:01:40,526
What?!

663
01:01:40,527 --> 01:01:45,527
She said that big people like you
should never use the power like that.

664
01:01:46,283 --> 01:01:48,868
She says something horrible will happen.

665
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:53,331
Mind your own business.

666
01:01:53,332 --> 01:01:58,332
What? More powerful than me?

667
01:01:59,171 --> 01:02:04,171
He's the one! He's been popping
in and out of my head lately!

668
01:02:04,343 --> 01:02:07,303
Where is he?! Where's this "Akira"?!

669
01:02:07,304 --> 01:02:07,845
What?!

670
01:02:07,846 --> 01:02:12,183
Kiyoko said that you'll awaken Akira.

671
01:02:12,184 --> 01:02:15,144
If that happens, no one
will be able to stop him.

672
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:16,896
So before that can happen,
we have to stop you.

673
01:02:16,897 --> 01:02:18,856
Impossible! Akira's already...

674
01:02:18,857 --> 01:02:22,985
Where is he?!

675
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:24,320
St°P it!

676
01:02:24,321 --> 01:02:24,865
Shut up!

677
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:35,206
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

678
01:02:35,207 --> 01:02:39,377
Enacting disaster protocols.

679
01:02:39,378 --> 01:02:42,964
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

680
01:02:42,965 --> 01:02:46,259
Enacting disaster protocols.

681
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:51,260
What the...?!

682
01:02:54,977 --> 01:02:59,522
Hands UP!

683
01:02:59,523 --> 01:03:04,523
Where the hell is the "Baby Room"?!

684
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:18,871
Oh, no! Run!

685
01:03:20,544 --> 01:03:22,879
Gangway, coming through! Coming through!

686
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,466
Damn it, move!

687
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:27,079
Kiyoko...

688
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:49,614
Damn, that hurt...

689
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:54,615
Kaneda? What're you doing here?

690
01:03:55,996 --> 01:04:00,996
Tetsuo! Are you okay?
I'm here to rescue you!

691
01:04:01,376 --> 01:04:06,376
Hurry up, you moron! If we don't get out
of here, those guys outside are gonna...

692
01:04:07,174 --> 01:04:11,844
There he is! Catch him!

693
01:04:11,845 --> 01:04:16,845
Stay away from me!

694
01:04:18,018 --> 01:04:21,771
Kaneda!

695
01:04:21,772 --> 01:04:26,234
Oh, right. I forgot you were there, Kaneda.

696
01:04:26,235 --> 01:04:28,444
That's okay, Kaneda.

697
01:04:28,445 --> 01:04:33,032
I won't be needing you to save me anymore.

698
01:04:33,033 --> 01:04:35,952
From now on, I'll be saving you.

699
01:04:35,953 --> 01:04:39,247
All you have to do is ask, Kanny.

700
01:04:39,248 --> 01:04:44,248
Say what? Who the hell do
you think you're talking to?!

701
01:04:45,045 --> 01:04:47,880
You don't like the way I talk?

702
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:49,465
Does it make you mad?

703
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:51,175
Well, what're you gonna do about it?!

704
01:04:51,176 --> 01:04:56,176
Huh, Kaneda?! What're
you gonna do about it?!

705
01:05:04,439 --> 01:05:09,439
That's enough! Don't hurt anyone else!

706
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,948
Where's this "Akira" guy?!

707
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:16,158
He...

708
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:19,495
The Olympic stadium...?
In an underground facility?

709
01:05:19,496 --> 01:05:24,496
No! You're wrong! Akira is...

710
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:25,251
Wait!

711
01:05:35,846 --> 01:05:40,846
What the hell? I can do this, too?!

712
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:48,482
Kiyoko, are you okay?

713
01:05:48,483 --> 01:05:50,401
It doesn't look like she's hurt.

714
01:05:50,402 --> 01:05:53,195
What about you, Masaru? You're bleeding.

715
01:05:53,196 --> 01:05:55,364
What happened to him?

716
01:05:55,365 --> 01:05:56,657
He flew away.

717
01:05:56,658 --> 01:06:01,454
How can he have so much power...?

718
01:06:01,455 --> 01:06:05,374
How could this have
happened? Ls anyone here?

719
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:09,170
He's developed so much
power in such a short time...

720
01:06:09,171 --> 01:06:11,422
Find him! Find Tetsuo!

721
01:06:11,423 --> 01:06:14,884
Find him! Go after him!
...Kaneda! Hang on, Kaneda!

722
01:06:14,885 --> 01:06:19,847
Hurry up! Get that rubble cleared!

723
01:06:19,848 --> 01:06:21,682
He went to where Akira is.

724
01:06:21,683 --> 01:06:25,686
What? You're all safe!

725
01:06:25,687 --> 01:06:29,482
He's heading for the facility
below the Olympic construction site.

726
01:06:29,483 --> 01:06:34,483
How did Tetsuo find out about that?!

727
01:06:35,364 --> 01:06:40,364
You mean he's gone outside?

728
01:06:41,328 --> 01:06:44,956
Damn it! We'll follow him!
Prepare for pursuit!

729
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:46,374
Yes, sir! ...He's heading west!

730
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:49,126
He's heading for the
Olympic construction site!

731
01:06:49,127 --> 01:06:51,963
Tell them to beef up their security!

732
01:06:51,964 --> 01:06:56,964
You...!
...Set up checkpoints on all...

733
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,642
According to the defense team, intruders
were encountered in the wiring shaft.

734
01:07:04,643 --> 01:07:06,519
Two disguised as workers resisted
and were shot, and the rest are at large.

735
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:11,600
He has to be stopped before his powers mature... Two disguised
as workers resisted and were shot, and the rest are at large.

736
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:14,694
Your objective is the boy Tetsuo Shima.

737
01:07:14,695 --> 01:07:18,155
If we are unable to capture him, you will
lure him out to the old city and attack.

738
01:07:18,156 --> 01:07:20,616
Request assistance from
the Eastern District Battalion.

739
01:07:20,617 --> 01:07:21,117
Yes, sir!

740
01:07:21,118 --> 01:07:25,663
Tell them there isn't a moment to lose!

741
01:07:25,664 --> 01:07:29,041
I've been waiting for you, Colonel.

742
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:32,378
Who the hell are you?!

743
01:07:32,379 --> 01:07:37,379
I'm here to inform you of the
supreme executive council's decision.

744
01:07:38,343 --> 01:07:42,680
At 2400 hours today, the Colonel is
hereby stripped of his command and rank,

745
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:45,099
and will be placed under arrest.

746
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,268
What?!

747
01:07:47,269 --> 01:07:49,812
Please come with us.

748
01:07:49,813 --> 01:07:54,813
You expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?

749
01:07:56,903 --> 01:07:58,362
Shoot him... Yes, sir!

750
01:07:58,363 --> 01:08:00,364
What?

751
01:08:00,365 --> 01:08:03,325
W-Wait!

752
01:08:03,326 --> 01:08:07,288
Enough! Open your eyes
and look at the big picture!

753
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:12,289
We can't dance to the tune of
corrupt politicians and capitalists!

754
01:08:14,629 --> 01:08:19,629
Don't you understand?!
It's pointless to fight anymore!

755
01:08:22,429 --> 01:08:26,849
Announce a state of emergency,
arrest all members of the executive council

756
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:29,643
and remove them from
the chain of command!

757
01:08:29,644 --> 01:08:31,520
We're going after Tetsuo!

758
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:36,521
Urgent message to all
district battalion commanders!

759
01:08:40,655 --> 01:08:45,159
"Haruki-ya."

760
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:50,160
Hey, what's up? You by yourself?

761
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:53,709
Weren't you in an accident or something?

762
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:57,254
Everybody's been worried.
So, you feeling better?

763
01:08:57,255 --> 01:09:01,008
Gimme some... capsules.

764
01:09:01,009 --> 01:09:04,762
Hey, are you sure about that?
You don't look so hot.

765
01:09:04,763 --> 01:09:07,973
Just hand 'em over!

766
01:09:07,974 --> 01:09:10,059
All right, if you say so.

767
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:14,396
But with all those demonstrations and
terrorist attacks lately, things are rough.

768
01:09:14,397 --> 01:09:19,397
They're hard to come by,
so they're pretty expensive.

769
01:09:24,783 --> 01:09:29,537
Tetsuo's run off, Kaneda's disappeared...
l guess the team's finished.

770
01:09:29,538 --> 01:09:34,538
And the checkpoints are so strict,
even the Clowns are staying put.

771
01:09:44,344 --> 01:09:46,345
What's wrong?

772
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:49,265
"This End Up."

773
01:09:49,266 --> 01:09:50,391
He's dead!

774
01:09:50,392 --> 01:09:53,853
What?!

775
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:58,854
What the...?

776
01:10:00,694 --> 01:10:02,027
Tetsuo?

777
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:06,866
What are you doing here?

778
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:09,702
You want some, too?

779
01:10:09,703 --> 01:10:13,330
What are you talking about, damn it?!
What the hell happened here?!

780
01:10:13,331 --> 01:10:18,331
The barkeep's dead!

781
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,964
A fish out of water dies, huh?

782
01:10:21,965 --> 01:10:26,965
You are Tetsuo... Aren't you?

783
01:10:28,096 --> 01:10:30,347
Kaneda sends his regards.

784
01:10:30,348 --> 01:10:31,849
You saw Kaneda?!

785
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:36,850
He's probably dead by now...

786
01:10:37,564 --> 01:10:41,192
You did this, Tetsuo?

787
01:10:41,193 --> 01:10:45,738
So anyway... Where's Kaneda's bike?

788
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:48,032
Tetsuo!

789
01:10:48,033 --> 01:10:50,242
I don't need a piece of
junk like that anymore...

790
01:10:50,243 --> 01:10:55,243
You son of a...

791
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:57,987
Yamagata!

792
01:11:05,342 --> 01:11:05,842
Shit...

793
01:11:14,184 --> 01:11:16,101
He went to where Akira is?

794
01:11:16,102 --> 01:11:18,312
That's what that girl said.

795
01:11:18,313 --> 01:11:22,733
The army, you, and Ryu are
all looking for this "Akira" guy,

796
01:11:22,734 --> 01:11:25,027
so that's why you're chasing after Tetsuo.

797
01:11:25,028 --> 01:11:29,323
It has something to do with
that power of Tetsuo's, right?

798
01:11:29,324 --> 01:11:34,324
What the hell is this "Akira"
thing you keep talking about?

799
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:39,537
Ryu told me about it once.
He said that Akira is absolute energy.

800
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:41,585
Absolute energy?

801
01:11:41,586 --> 01:11:45,589
Humans do all kinds of
things during their lifetime, right?

802
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:50,511
Discovering things, building things...

803
01:11:50,512 --> 01:11:55,512
Things like houses, motorcycles,
bridges, cities, and rockets...

804
01:11:58,144 --> 01:12:03,144
All that knowledge and energy...
Where do you suppose it comes from?

805
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:06,944
Humans were like monkeys once, right?

806
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:10,656
And before that, like reptiles and fish.

807
01:12:10,657 --> 01:12:14,785
And before that, plankton and amoebas.

808
01:12:14,786 --> 01:12:19,206
Even creatures like those have
incredible energy inside them.

809
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:22,668
Because of genes, I guess.

810
01:12:22,669 --> 01:12:27,669
And even before that, maybe
there were genes in the water and air.

811
01:12:27,799 --> 01:12:30,384
Even in space dust, too, I bet.

812
01:12:30,385 --> 01:12:34,847
If that's true, what
memories are hidden in it?

813
01:12:34,848 --> 01:12:38,684
The beginning of the universe, maybe.
Or maybe even before that.

814
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:42,688
Hey, what's the matter? Are you okay?

815
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:45,232
Did you get hit on the head back there?

816
01:12:45,233 --> 01:12:49,028
Maybe everyone has those memories.

817
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:51,989
What if there were some mistake
and the progression went wrong,

818
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:56,990
and something like an amoeba
were given power like a human's?

819
01:12:58,246 --> 01:13:00,914
That's what Akira is?

820
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:04,209
Amoebas don't build houses and bridges.

821
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:07,004
They just devour all the food around them.

822
01:13:07,005 --> 01:13:11,759
That's what Tetsuo's doing?
You're saying he has that kind of energy?!

823
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,430
A long time ago, there were people
who tried to control that power.

824
01:13:16,431 --> 01:13:18,849
At the government's request, you see.

825
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:23,850
They failed, and it triggered
the Fall of Tokyo.

826
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:29,356
That power is still too much for...

827
01:13:30,612 --> 01:13:32,363
What?!

828
01:13:32,364 --> 01:13:37,364
The door's unlocked.

829
01:13:37,494 --> 01:13:37,994
Huh?

830
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:46,794
This has got to be a trap.

831
01:13:46,795 --> 01:13:47,878
Go back, then.

832
01:13:47,879 --> 01:13:52,879
No, we ought to find out
how much of it is a trap...

833
01:13:53,885 --> 01:13:58,885
By the way, what's
with you and that Ryu guy?

834
01:13:59,057 --> 01:14:01,183
What do you mean?
...You're always together.

835
01:14:01,184 --> 01:14:04,019
That's none of your business!

836
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:08,941
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?

837
01:14:08,942 --> 01:14:09,858
HUS"?

838
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:13,320
Hey, wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?

839
01:14:13,321 --> 01:14:14,780
Do you think this will work?

840
01:14:14,781 --> 01:14:19,781
It can't be helped. At this point,
our only option is to use her.

841
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:26,329
The fact that she turned up right
under our noses says as much, I think.

842
01:14:28,253 --> 01:14:33,253
I guess...

843
01:14:43,309 --> 01:14:47,688
Have arrived at Ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.

844
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:51,108
Northern District battalion has not
responded to mobilization request.

845
01:14:51,109 --> 01:14:53,944
Special search team to HQ!
Special search team to HQ!

846
01:14:53,945 --> 01:14:58,073
We're at the Haruki-ya snack bar
near the highway interchange in Ward 8.

847
01:14:58,074 --> 01:15:03,074
It doesn't look like a bomb
explosion, so we think it was him.

848
01:15:04,122 --> 01:15:08,000
It was almost certainly the work of
the subject that escaped from the lab.

849
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:13,001
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Understood!

850
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:19,553
Kaneda!

851
01:15:19,554 --> 01:15:22,222
What?! Yamagata's dead?!

852
01:15:22,223 --> 01:15:25,142
Something seemed strange
about him from the second I saw him.

853
01:15:25,143 --> 01:15:28,061
He was wearing what looked
like a white hospital gown.

854
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:31,064
It was like he was a different person.

855
01:15:31,065 --> 01:15:36,065
Yamagata asked him
if he was really Tetsuo.

856
01:15:36,154 --> 01:15:41,154
And then... Yamagata, he...

857
01:15:43,536 --> 01:15:46,121
We've always been together.

858
01:15:46,122 --> 01:15:51,122
I've known everything about him
since we were in the children's home.

859
01:15:52,545 --> 01:15:57,508
He was a klutz, and
everybody made him cry.

860
01:15:57,509 --> 01:16:02,012
Oh, right... He wanted to
know where your bike was.

861
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:07,013
My bike...?

862
01:16:12,106 --> 01:16:14,816
What're you gonna do?

863
01:16:14,817 --> 01:16:19,817
I'm gonna send Yamagata his bike.

864
01:16:21,699 --> 01:16:26,699
You dumb bastard!

865
01:16:27,455 --> 01:16:27,955
Kaneda!

866
01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:46,848
Kei!

867
01:16:46,849 --> 01:16:51,849
What's wrong?

868
01:16:52,063 --> 01:16:57,063
You! You were there that night...

869
01:16:58,528 --> 01:16:59,028
Wait!

870
01:17:05,994 --> 01:17:06,494
Kei!

871
01:17:10,999 --> 01:17:14,209
They disappeared!

872
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:17,671
You were the ones who
changed Tetsuo too, weren't you?

873
01:17:17,672 --> 01:17:22,672
Akira's power exists within everyone.

874
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,012
Who's there?!

875
01:17:25,013 --> 01:17:30,013
But when that power is awakened,
even if you weren't prepared for it,

876
01:17:31,561 --> 01:17:36,561
you must choose how to use it.

877
01:17:37,483 --> 01:17:41,862
And he has made his choice.

878
01:17:41,863 --> 01:17:46,863
Tetsuo is our newest Companion.

879
01:17:47,243 --> 01:17:51,455
We're partly to blame for his actions.

880
01:17:51,456 --> 01:17:54,708
Why did you take Kei, then?!

881
01:17:54,709 --> 01:17:57,461
We want her to help us.

882
01:17:57,462 --> 01:18:00,797
You can't just use people
like that! Bring Kei back!

883
01:18:00,798 --> 01:18:05,798
Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's
gonna kill him, it should be us!

884
01:18:07,597 --> 01:18:10,098
Hey!

885
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:11,642
Damn it!

886
01:18:11,643 --> 01:18:15,937
Mr. Omi and the other executives
have been arrested by the coup...?

887
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:17,189
Y-Yes, that's right.

888
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:19,816
The house guards are
fighting them right now.

889
01:18:19,817 --> 01:18:21,193
Yes.

890
01:18:21,194 --> 01:18:23,904
I'd like to have a helicopter
waiting at West Haneda.

891
01:18:23,905 --> 01:18:25,739
Yes.

892
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:30,740
That damned Colonel...
I can't believe he's taken up arms.

893
01:18:32,163 --> 01:18:37,163
I underestimated him.

894
01:18:38,378 --> 01:18:43,378
Hold them here! Damn!

895
01:19:10,952 --> 01:19:13,328
Mr. Nezu...

896
01:19:13,329 --> 01:19:16,289
R-Ryu?! Is that you?

897
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,208
I'm sorry, sir...

898
01:19:18,209 --> 01:19:20,752
The mission was a failure.

899
01:19:20,753 --> 01:19:22,546
What are you doing here?!

900
01:19:22,547 --> 01:19:26,007
I've told you, you can't be seen here!

901
01:19:26,008 --> 01:19:28,135
All of my men...

902
01:19:28,136 --> 01:19:30,053
They've all been killed.

903
01:19:30,054 --> 01:19:33,682
Y-You sold me out,
didn't you, you bastard?!

904
01:19:33,683 --> 01:19:38,683
What? You can't be...

905
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:39,230
Kei...

906
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:48,905
I got fresh fish in here, buddy!
I'm gonna get compensated for 'em, right?

907
01:19:48,906 --> 01:19:53,076
Please, I have to catch a flight at noon!

908
01:19:53,077 --> 01:19:54,703
What?

909
01:19:54,704 --> 01:19:56,788
7th Avenue is just ahead!

910
01:19:56,789 --> 01:20:01,789
It intersects this road
100 meters from here!

911
01:20:03,296 --> 01:20:08,296
Prepare for battle!

912
01:20:13,556 --> 01:20:17,225
Right, we've spotted the subject.

913
01:20:17,226 --> 01:20:19,686
What? Attack?!

914
01:20:19,687 --> 01:20:24,687
But he's just a... We're attacking a boy?!

915
01:20:27,528 --> 01:20:28,737
Look! There he is!

916
01:20:28,738 --> 01:20:29,529
Impossible!

917
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:34,530
Is this for real?

918
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,043
"Samurai Spirit."

919
01:20:43,044 --> 01:20:47,339
Firing preparations complete.

920
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:52,340
Damn it! Fire!

921
01:21:02,688 --> 01:21:04,689
Akira! ...lt's Lord Akira!

922
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:07,651
It's the advent of Lord Akira!

923
01:21:07,652 --> 01:21:09,444
That's not him! Don't be fooled!

924
01:21:09,445 --> 01:21:10,529
That's not Lord Akira!

925
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:12,781
Shut up!

926
01:21:12,782 --> 01:21:16,159
Long live Lord Akira!

927
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,537
Fire!

928
01:21:18,538 --> 01:21:19,579
Huh?

929
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:24,580
What's wrong?

930
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:48,710
"Akira."

931
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:58,136
What in the world is
happening here in Neo Tokyo?

932
01:22:58,137 --> 01:23:01,097
What you see here seems to
be fires caused by tank cannons.

933
01:23:01,098 --> 01:23:04,142
But who is this young boy?

934
01:23:04,143 --> 01:23:07,437
Is he fighting the coup
forces all by himself?

935
01:23:07,438 --> 01:23:12,438
Viewers, the army has just
illegally ordered us to land!

936
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:16,279
Freedom of the press is now in jeopardy!

937
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,740
What happened? Were they cut off?

938
01:23:18,741 --> 01:23:22,535
The bridge! He's heading for the bridge!

939
01:23:22,536 --> 01:23:27,536
Let's go see!

940
01:23:40,513 --> 01:23:43,515
Are you really going alone?

941
01:23:43,516 --> 01:23:46,351
He wants this, doesn't he?

942
01:23:46,352 --> 01:23:49,521
We should call the gang together.

943
01:23:49,522 --> 01:23:50,939
Hey!

944
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:55,193
I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.

945
01:23:55,194 --> 01:24:00,194
Hey, Kaneda! Wait!

946
01:24:04,453 --> 01:24:06,871
Half seem to be
anti-government demonstrators.

947
01:24:06,872 --> 01:24:11,418
The rest are... Well, they're more
like some crazy cult than onlookers.

948
01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:16,419
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.

949
01:24:17,591 --> 01:24:22,591
"We Worship the Great Lord Akira."

950
01:24:30,354 --> 01:24:32,856
Fear not!

951
01:24:32,857 --> 01:24:37,857
Your bodies will be purified in the flames!

952
01:24:39,196 --> 01:24:42,574
Ready!

953
01:24:42,575 --> 01:24:43,075
Fire!

954
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:53,376
Set the switch to hold for three
seconds and converge your beams!

955
01:24:53,377 --> 01:24:54,544
Aim!

956
01:24:54,545 --> 01:24:55,045
Fire!

957
01:25:01,552 --> 01:25:06,552
Watch this!

958
01:25:09,435 --> 01:25:14,435
Look out! Let's get out of here!

959
01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:22,658
Help me!

960
01:25:30,581 --> 01:25:33,374
Ground forces! Ground forces, come in!

961
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:35,502
Report! What is the subject's status?!

962
01:25:35,503 --> 01:25:38,922
Ground forces!

963
01:25:38,923 --> 01:25:40,632
Call the Doctor.

964
01:25:40,633 --> 01:25:43,718
We have confirmation of his
recent movements and are in pursuit.

965
01:25:43,719 --> 01:25:46,262
His present position is... Let's see...

966
01:25:46,263 --> 01:25:51,263
Coordinates 99871 by 4332.

967
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,355
That's about 2 km south of the
Olympics construction site in the old city.

968
01:25:55,356 --> 01:25:55,856
What?!

969
01:26:01,946 --> 01:26:04,030
What was that?

970
01:26:04,031 --> 01:26:06,032
Look!

971
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:09,786
That's near the toll booth that's
being guarded by the 2nd platoon.

972
01:26:09,787 --> 01:26:12,372
Wha"?

973
01:26:12,373 --> 01:26:16,126
Huh?

974
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:20,088
Please turn around!
This area's off limits to civilians!

975
01:26:20,089 --> 01:26:22,715
What? That's the subject?!

976
01:26:22,716 --> 01:26:24,300
S-Stop!

977
01:26:24,301 --> 01:26:29,301
Stop, damn it!

978
01:27:31,452 --> 01:27:36,452
Nice place you have here.

979
01:27:41,253 --> 01:27:44,172
Wait, you were with Kaneda.

980
01:27:44,173 --> 01:27:48,843
You shouldn't use your power this way.

981
01:27:48,844 --> 01:27:49,969
What?

982
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:54,807
In the end, you won't
be able to control it.

983
01:27:54,808 --> 01:27:56,309
The kids...

984
01:27:56,310 --> 01:28:01,310
You're those brats, aren't you?!

985
01:28:16,038 --> 01:28:21,038
Okay, then...!

986
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:44,979
What the...?

987
01:28:52,616 --> 01:28:57,616
It's not safe here, Colonel!

988
01:29:35,034 --> 01:29:40,034
Well, what're you gonna do?

989
01:31:04,456 --> 01:31:05,000
°Pen up!

990
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,845
What the hell?

991
01:31:18,846 --> 01:31:21,848
That's Akira, Tetsuo!

992
01:31:21,849 --> 01:31:25,184
That's the "Akira" you wanted to meet.

993
01:31:25,185 --> 01:31:28,020
There's your Messiah!

994
01:31:28,021 --> 01:31:30,565
After his transcendental awakening,

995
01:31:30,566 --> 01:31:35,403
his body was subjected to
every test known to science.

996
01:31:35,404 --> 01:31:40,404
And that's what was left of it.

997
01:31:46,874 --> 01:31:48,458
"Cranial Nerve."

998
01:31:48,459 --> 01:31:52,753
The scientists back then
were unable to solve the mystery,

999
01:31:52,754 --> 01:31:57,049
so they decided to entrust their
collected data and test samples

1000
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:02,050
to future generations by
preserving them in a frozen Capsule.

1001
01:32:02,598 --> 01:32:04,223
SOL... We'll use SOL!

1002
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:07,351
Sir?

1003
01:32:07,352 --> 01:32:10,438
Akira is already dead!

1004
01:32:10,439 --> 01:32:15,439
Well? Are you satisfied now, Tetsuo?

1005
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:21,032
So come back with us!

1006
01:32:21,033 --> 01:32:23,409
Like hell!

1007
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:25,453
Contact the central defense center

1008
01:32:25,454 --> 01:32:29,207
and tell them to patch us
through to SOL's control circuits!

1009
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:29,820
Yes, sir!

1010
01:32:46,183 --> 01:32:48,226
Hey, watch it!

1011
01:32:48,227 --> 01:32:53,227
Damn it, move! Get out of the way!

1012
01:33:08,747 --> 01:33:13,747
What is this, science class?

1013
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:31,561
What's wrong? Have some trouble?

1014
01:33:31,562 --> 01:33:35,356
Yeah, but I already took care of it.

1015
01:33:35,357 --> 01:33:37,483
If you were here earlier,
you could've watched the show.

1016
01:33:37,484 --> 01:33:40,361
You had me worried again.

1017
01:33:40,362 --> 01:33:43,656
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.

1018
01:33:43,657 --> 01:33:48,369
Kaneda, you've always
been a pain in the ass.

1019
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:53,165
You've been telling me what
to do ever since we were kids.

1020
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:55,334
You always treat me like a kid.

1021
01:33:55,335 --> 01:33:58,212
You always show up and
start bossing me around!

1022
01:33:58,213 --> 01:34:00,339
And now you're a boss, too...

1023
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,383
Of this pile of rubble.

1024
01:34:02,384 --> 01:34:03,718
Kaneda!

1025
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:06,387
That's Mister Kaneda to you, punk!

1026
01:34:06,388 --> 01:34:06,888
Die!

1027
01:34:18,108 --> 01:34:18,608
Tetsuo!

1028
01:34:43,425 --> 01:34:48,425
Son of a...

1029
01:34:58,523 --> 01:35:01,525
Kei!

1030
01:35:01,526 --> 01:35:02,138
Oh, hell!

1031
01:35:06,573 --> 01:35:11,573
Let's do it!

1032
01:35:19,795 --> 01:35:22,630
Got him!

1033
01:35:22,631 --> 01:35:23,131
Huh?

1034
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:30,262
The battery?!

1035
01:35:30,263 --> 01:35:33,599
What's the matter, Kaneda?

1036
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,143
God damn it! This ain't fair, Tetsuo!

1037
01:35:36,144 --> 01:35:41,023
Fight with your bare hands!

1038
01:35:41,024 --> 01:35:44,193
Oh, this is funny...

1039
01:35:44,194 --> 01:35:46,779
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?

1040
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:51,780
Now do you understand how it feels?

1041
01:35:56,248 --> 01:36:01,248
What's this light?

1042
01:36:09,052 --> 01:36:10,261
Well, did you hit him?

1043
01:36:10,262 --> 01:36:13,264
We're too close to the impact point.
There's too much electrical interference.

1044
01:36:13,265 --> 01:36:18,265
Prepare a second Volley!

1045
01:36:37,748 --> 01:36:42,748
Hey! Kaneda!

1046
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,020
Tetsuo!

1047
01:37:18,789 --> 01:37:20,581
Shit...

1048
01:37:20,582 --> 01:37:22,082
Huh?

1049
01:37:22,083 --> 01:37:27,083
What the...?

1050
01:37:58,995 --> 01:38:00,830
Correcting for tracking system error.

1051
01:38:00,831 --> 01:38:02,873
T-minus-20 to energy alteration.

1052
01:38:02,874 --> 01:38:04,375
Fire extinguishers!
...Are you okay?

1053
01:38:04,376 --> 01:38:05,167
Hurry! Hurry!

1054
01:38:05,168 --> 01:38:10,168
What happened? What's going on?

1055
01:38:16,555 --> 01:38:19,974
Kaneda!

1056
01:38:19,975 --> 01:38:21,350
Kai! Kai!

1057
01:38:21,351 --> 01:38:22,893
Kaneda! ...Kaneda!

1058
01:38:22,894 --> 01:38:23,811
Get on!

1059
01:38:23,812 --> 01:38:25,062
Get on? Where?

1060
01:38:25,063 --> 01:38:30,063
Hurry! Hurry!

1061
01:38:48,879 --> 01:38:53,879
What's that?

1062
01:39:04,394 --> 01:39:09,394
They say it's SOL.

1063
01:39:17,365 --> 01:39:22,365
Magnificent...

1064
01:39:28,752 --> 01:39:32,963
When Tetsuo's power reaches its peak?

1065
01:39:32,964 --> 01:39:34,840
That's when we do it.

1066
01:39:34,841 --> 01:39:38,344
But will it work?

1067
01:39:38,345 --> 01:39:43,345
The future doesn't
proceed along a single course.

1068
01:39:43,433 --> 01:39:48,433
There ought to be a future we can choose.

1069
01:39:56,947 --> 01:39:58,697
What's Tetsuo's status?

1070
01:39:58,698 --> 01:40:00,699
Ah, Colonel...

1071
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:04,203
We set up a camera in the
stadium a while ago.

1072
01:40:04,204 --> 01:40:07,373
We have him under observation.

1073
01:40:07,374 --> 01:40:11,585
Colonel, you must take a look at this data!

1074
01:40:11,586 --> 01:40:14,755
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject, but...

1075
01:40:14,756 --> 01:40:17,800
It's magnificent. Absolutely magnificent.

1076
01:40:17,801 --> 01:40:20,678
This is clearly a proton Collapse.

1077
01:40:20,679 --> 01:40:24,848
We're also detecting a fair number of
what we believe to be unknown particles.

1078
01:40:24,849 --> 01:40:27,893
If we can put this into a
theoretical framework, physics...

1079
01:40:27,894 --> 01:40:29,353
No, science...

1080
01:40:29,354 --> 01:40:34,354
Humanity itself could touch the
fundamental truths of the universe!

1081
01:40:34,776 --> 01:40:36,652
Oh. That's...

1082
01:40:36,653 --> 01:40:39,363
We still haven't finished
making our adjustments.

1083
01:40:39,364 --> 01:40:44,364
Uh, Colonel!

1084
01:40:46,371 --> 01:40:51,333
T-That's...!

1085
01:40:51,334 --> 01:40:53,836
You bastard! What did I tell you?!

1086
01:40:53,837 --> 01:40:55,671
B-But, Colonel!

1087
01:40:55,672 --> 01:40:59,717
I couldn't throw away
such a magnificent subject!

1088
01:40:59,718 --> 01:41:00,262
Shut up!

1089
01:41:24,451 --> 01:41:26,243
Shit! It's on fire!

1090
01:41:26,244 --> 01:41:27,536
The battery! The battery!

1091
01:41:27,537 --> 01:41:30,664
My bike! It's burning up!

1092
01:41:30,665 --> 01:41:33,208
Hey, what's a bike or two?

1093
01:41:33,209 --> 01:41:37,379
What? Then there's nothing
wrong with using yours, right?

1094
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:38,589
You heard that?

1095
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:39,840
Yeah, I did!

1096
01:41:39,841 --> 01:41:44,841
Hey, your bike's still on fire.

1097
01:42:23,301 --> 01:42:23,801
Tetsuo?

1098
01:42:36,523 --> 01:42:40,984
Tetsuo, why does
everyone call you "Akira"?

1099
01:42:40,985 --> 01:42:45,531
He never existed in the first place.

1100
01:42:45,532 --> 01:42:50,202
They didn't care who it was.

1101
01:42:50,203 --> 01:42:53,205
Just so long as he destroyed things.

1102
01:42:53,206 --> 01:42:55,707
Your arm!

1103
01:42:55,708 --> 01:43:00,708
It doesn't look like much,
but it works pretty good.

1104
01:43:02,507 --> 01:43:07,344
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1105
01:43:07,345 --> 01:43:09,096
It's nothing!

1106
01:43:09,097 --> 01:43:10,013
Tetsuo...

1107
01:43:10,014 --> 01:43:15,014
Shut up! Just go away!

1108
01:43:19,524 --> 01:43:21,900
Medicine...

1109
01:43:21,901 --> 01:43:25,279
What's wrong, Tetsuo? Are you in pain?

1110
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:29,032
Go back to the lab and
get me some of that medicine!

1111
01:43:29,033 --> 01:43:30,868
Did you hear that, Doctor?

1112
01:43:30,869 --> 01:43:32,286
Yes, Colonel.

1113
01:43:32,287 --> 01:43:34,663
Well? Can you see any signs of it?

1114
01:43:34,664 --> 01:43:37,249
I'm not entirely certain,

1115
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:41,628
but it seems that the power that had been
held back by the drugs is breaking free.

1116
01:43:41,629 --> 01:43:45,257
He may not be able to control the
power that has awakened so suddenly.

1117
01:43:45,258 --> 01:43:48,719
At any rate, he's in an
extremely dangerous condition!

1118
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:53,720
If you don't go back to the lab and
receive proper treatment, you may die.

1119
01:43:56,186 --> 01:44:00,105
You want me to enroll in that
kindergarten and live happily ever after?

1120
01:44:00,106 --> 01:44:05,106
Take my medicine every day
and shrivel up like those kids?!

1121
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:15,037
Kaori... Kaori...

1122
01:44:15,038 --> 01:44:19,124
Please... l need that medicine...

1123
01:44:19,125 --> 01:44:21,001
No...!

1124
01:44:21,002 --> 01:44:23,670
Tetsuo!

1125
01:44:23,671 --> 01:44:27,049
Tetsuo!

1126
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:27,594
Tetsuo..

1127
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:00,919
Kaneda?!

1128
01:45:39,872 --> 01:45:40,372
Huh?

1129
01:45:48,506 --> 01:45:53,506
Son of a...

1130
01:45:54,137 --> 01:45:59,137
You kids... What are you doing here?

1131
01:46:02,395 --> 01:46:06,565
You never learn, do you?

1132
01:46:06,566 --> 01:46:07,066
Tetsuo!

1133
01:46:22,582 --> 01:46:26,710
Takashi...

1134
01:46:26,711 --> 01:46:27,255
Akira...

1135
01:46:41,559 --> 01:46:46,559
Kaneda...? H-Help me...!

1136
01:46:54,739 --> 01:46:55,283
Kaori...

1137
01:46:59,744 --> 01:47:04,744
Help me...!

1138
01:47:13,758 --> 01:47:15,801
Help me!

1139
01:47:15,802 --> 01:47:16,346
St°P it!

1140
01:47:34,821 --> 01:47:35,821
Kaori?

1141
01:47:35,822 --> 01:47:38,865
Kaori! Kaori!

1142
01:47:38,866 --> 01:47:41,660
Tetsuo? Ls that you, Tetsuo?!

1143
01:47:41,661 --> 01:47:44,830
Kaori! Kaori's gonna die!

1144
01:47:44,831 --> 01:47:47,624
What?! What did you say?!

1145
01:47:47,625 --> 01:47:50,293
My body's not doing what I tell it to!

1146
01:47:50,294 --> 01:47:52,921
My power's acting on its own...!

1147
01:47:52,922 --> 01:47:55,382
Kaori!

1148
01:47:55,383 --> 01:47:57,592
Kaori's dying!

1149
01:47:57,593 --> 01:47:59,928
Kaneda, help me!

1150
01:47:59,929 --> 01:48:02,013
Stop, Tetsuo!

1151
01:48:02,014 --> 01:48:04,182
St°P it!

1152
01:48:04,183 --> 01:48:09,183
Kaori's pain is coming into me...!

1153
01:48:09,605 --> 01:48:12,190
Tetsuo!

1154
01:48:12,191 --> 01:48:17,191
Kaneda! Run away!

1155
01:48:29,041 --> 01:48:29,541
Tetsuo!

1156
01:48:43,014 --> 01:48:48,014
Kiyoko! Takashi! Masaru!
Get away from here!

1157
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,733
Come on!

1158
01:48:58,863 --> 01:49:03,863
I can't believe it. It's as if...

1159
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:19,170
Kiyoko! Taka...

1160
01:49:51,624 --> 01:49:56,624
Hi, Akira.

1161
01:50:04,262 --> 01:50:07,389
Th-This is...

1162
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:12,390
But that's... Oh, no!

1163
01:50:19,026 --> 01:50:21,695
W-Where am I?

1164
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:24,030
Hurry! Get into the tunnel!

1165
01:50:24,031 --> 01:50:25,448
You'll be safe in there.

1166
01:50:25,449 --> 01:50:30,449
Kiyoko! Where are you?

1167
01:50:42,049 --> 01:50:44,050
Tetsuo!

1168
01:50:44,051 --> 01:50:46,678
Kaneda!

1169
01:50:46,679 --> 01:50:50,098
Hang on!

1170
01:50:50,099 --> 01:50:52,726
If you don't get out of here
now, you'll... Out of the way!

1171
01:50:52,727 --> 01:50:54,269
Tetsuo!

1172
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:54,882
Don't go!

1173
01:51:02,778 --> 01:51:05,363
No, Takashi!

1174
01:51:05,364 --> 01:51:08,908
If you went in now, you'd be trapped, too.

1175
01:51:08,909 --> 01:51:13,909
But none of this is his fault!

1176
01:51:19,754 --> 01:51:24,754
Takashi! ...Takashi!

1177
01:51:29,096 --> 01:51:34,096
If we went in, we wouldn't be
strong enough to come back out.

1178
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:40,565
But if the three of us worked together,
maybe we could at least save that boy.

1179
01:51:40,566 --> 01:51:42,275
You're right.

1180
01:51:42,276 --> 01:51:47,276
Together, the three of us could...

1181
01:51:52,995 --> 01:51:55,121
Oh, man...!

1182
01:51:55,122 --> 01:51:58,667
We should get out of here. Hey!

1183
01:51:58,668 --> 01:51:59,280
Kaneda...

1184
01:52:33,035 --> 01:52:36,621
Look, you're not revving
your engine enough.

1185
01:52:36,622 --> 01:52:40,375
When you go into a corner, lean like
you're trying to kill yourself. Watch!

1186
01:52:40,376 --> 01:52:42,043
What're you doing?

1187
01:52:42,044 --> 01:52:45,547
Cornering, man.

1188
01:52:45,548 --> 01:52:50,548
Got it, Tetsuo...?

1189
01:52:53,597 --> 01:52:55,515
Look, there's another one!

1190
01:52:55,516 --> 01:52:57,851
Another transfer student?
...He was abandoned.

1191
01:52:57,852 --> 01:53:02,852
You can see it in his face.

1192
01:53:03,607 --> 01:53:08,607
Are... Are these your dreams, Tetsuo?

1193
01:53:10,156 --> 01:53:10,656
Wait!

1194
01:54:28,692 --> 01:54:31,903
This is Akira...?

1195
01:54:31,904 --> 01:54:35,281
Yes. We called him.

1196
01:54:35,282 --> 01:54:37,575
To have him take Tetsuo away.

1197
01:54:37,576 --> 01:54:40,995
Take him away? Take him where?

1198
01:54:40,996 --> 01:54:43,373
It's too much for Tetsuo.

1199
01:54:43,374 --> 01:54:47,001
And for us. And for Akira.

1200
01:54:47,002 --> 01:54:50,755
It's too big for us as we are now.

1201
01:54:50,756 --> 01:54:54,759
But someday, we'll also be able to...

1202
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:58,012
You see, it's already begun.

1203
01:54:58,013 --> 01:55:00,431
Your friend's...

1204
01:55:00,432 --> 01:55:03,142
My friend?

1205
01:55:03,143 --> 01:55:08,143
Kei! You mean Kei, don't you?

1206
01:55:31,714 --> 01:55:32,326
Tetsuo...

1207
01:55:38,012 --> 01:55:43,012
This is yours, right?

1208
01:55:45,686 --> 01:55:50,064
They're always like that with the
new kids. You came today, right?

1209
01:55:50,065 --> 01:55:51,774
They beat me up, too.

1210
01:55:51,775 --> 01:55:55,069
But the truth is, those guys are wimps.

1211
01:55:55,070 --> 01:56:00,070
I'm Tetsuo. Tetsuo Shima.

1212
01:56:01,035 --> 01:56:04,203
To tell you the truth, I
just got here myself.

1213
01:56:04,204 --> 01:56:06,205
I'm...

1214
01:56:06,206 --> 01:56:08,958
Kaneda...

1215
01:56:08,959 --> 01:56:11,210
Kaneda?

1216
01:56:11,211 --> 01:56:12,003
Kaneda!

1217
01:56:12,004 --> 01:56:12,504
Kei?

1218
01:56:39,031 --> 01:56:44,031
W-What's happening?
What in the world is happening?

1219
01:56:44,995 --> 01:56:47,497
B-But this isn't...

1220
01:56:47,498 --> 01:56:52,498
If this is correct, it's almost as if...
Is this the birth of a universe?!

1221
01:56:58,092 --> 01:56:58,592
Kei!

1222
01:57:06,850 --> 01:57:10,645
What happened?

1223
01:57:10,646 --> 01:57:15,646
It's disappearing...! It's disappearing!

1224
01:58:24,303 --> 01:58:24,803
Kaneda!

1225
01:58:50,037 --> 01:58:54,290
Tetsuo...

1226
01:58:54,291 --> 01:58:57,335
Kaneda...

1227
01:58:57,336 --> 01:59:00,171
Thanks.

1228
01:59:00,172 --> 01:59:05,172
You called to me, right? I heard you.

1229
01:59:10,307 --> 01:59:13,434
Kaneda, don't tell me you're...

1230
01:59:13,435 --> 01:59:15,853
What about Tetsuo?

1231
01:59:15,854 --> 01:59:18,648
He left.

1232
01:59:18,649 --> 01:59:20,817
So did those three kids.

1233
01:59:20,818 --> 01:59:22,110
Akira, too.

1234
01:59:22,111 --> 01:59:26,364
Kaneda, back then, you...

1235
01:59:26,365 --> 01:59:31,365
Kaneda! You're alive?!

1236
01:59:31,537 --> 01:59:36,537
I thought you were in there for sure!

1237
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,544
Tetsuo...

1238
01:59:39,545 --> 01:59:41,712
What happened to Tetsuo?

1239
01:59:41,713 --> 01:59:43,172
Is he dead?!

1240
01:59:43,173 --> 01:59:48,173
I'm not so sure. But he's probably...

1241
02:00:12,327 --> 02:00:16,205
But someday, we'll also be able to...

1242
02:00:16,206 --> 02:00:21,206
You see, it's already begun.

1243
02:00:37,519 --> 02:00:42,519
I am... Tetsuo.

1244
02:00:43,519 --> 02:01:19,519
