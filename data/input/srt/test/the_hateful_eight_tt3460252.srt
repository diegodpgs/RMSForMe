1
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,191
Hyah! Huh!

2
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,754
Get in there now!

3
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,712
Get in! Get in!

4
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,832
Get in there, Dude!

5
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,996
Get in now!

6
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,080
Hyah! Come on! Huh!

7
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,954
All right! Huh!

8
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,993
Huh!

9
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,079
Whoa! Whoa!

10
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,839
Whoa!

11
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,396
Got room for one more?

12
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,876
Who the hell are you?!

13
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,713
And what happened to them?

14
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,440
Name's Major Marquis Warren 

15
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,199
former U.S. Cavalry.

16
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,800
Currently a servant of the court.

17
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,594
Trying to bring a couple
no-goods into market.

18
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,752
Got the paperwork on 'em in my pocket.

19
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,997
You takin' 'em into Red Rock?

20
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,952
Figure that's where you headed, right?

21
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,309
I am.

22
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
That damn blasted blizzard

23
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,957
has been on our ass for the last three hours.

24
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,350
There ain't no way we gonna make
it all the way to Red Rock

25
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,836
Fore it catches us.
So you hightailin' it halfway 

26
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,076
to Minnie's Haberdashery?

27
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,232
You know I am.

28
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,589
May I come aboard?

29
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,712
Well, smoke 

30
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,878
if it up to me, yes.

31
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,997
But it ain't up to me.

32
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,713
Who's it up to?

33
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,559
Fella in the wagon.

34
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,115
Fella in the wagon ain't partial to company?

35
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,436
Fella in the wagon he paid for a private trip 

36
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,119
and I'm here to tell you 

37
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,072
he paid a pretty penny for privacy.

38
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,999
So if you want to go to Minnie's with us 

39
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,316
you gonna have to talk to him.

40
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,909
Well 

41
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,316
that's what I'll do.

42
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,918
Hold it, black fella.

43
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,397
Fore you approach you take them two guns of yours

44
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,752
and you lay 'em on that rock over yonder.

45
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,352
Then you raise both your
hands way above your hat.

46
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,631
Then you approach.

47
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,194
Molasses-like.

48
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,391
Real trustin' fella, huh?

49
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,352
Not so much.

50
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,877
Put 'em down.

51
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,398
Come on ahead.

52
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,877
I said way above your hat, goddamn it!

53
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,920
Now come forward.

54
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,833
That's far enough.

55
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,718
Well, I'll be dogged.

56
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,633
You a black fella I know.

57
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,076
Colonel somethin'-or-other Warren, right?

58
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,113
Major Marquis Warren.

59
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,993
I know you, too.

60
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,077
We, uh, shared a steak dinner

61
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,157
once upon a time in Chattanooga.

62
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,078
You John Ruth The Hangman.

63
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,680
That'd be me.

64
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,995
How long's that been?

65
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,520
Since that steak?

66
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,758
Oh!..eight months.

67
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,349
So why don't you explain to me

68
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,551
what a African bounty hunter's doin'

69
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,832
wanderin' around in the snow
in the middle of Wyoming?

70
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,920
Trying to get a couple of bounties in to Red Rock.

71
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,190
So you still in business?

72
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,754
You know I am.

73
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,673
Happened to your horse?

74
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,077
Circumstances caused us to have
to take the long way round.

75
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,112
My horse couldn't make it.
Mm.

76
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,630
You don't know nothin' bout this filly here.

77
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,200
Nope.

78
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,596
Don't even know her name?
Nope.

79
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,396
Well, I guess that makes
this one fortuitous wagon.

80
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,472
I sure as hell hope so.

81
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,150
Major Marquis Warren this here's Daisy Domergue.

82
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,559
Domergue, to you this is Major Warren.

83
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,160
Howdy, nigger.

84
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,672
She's a pepper, ain't she?

85
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,680
Now, girl, don't you know
the darkies don't like

86
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,920
being called niggers no more?

87
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,275
They find it offensive.

88
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,914
I been called worse.

89
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,434
Now, that I can believe.

90
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,960
You never heard of her, huh?

91
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,400
Should I?

92
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,079
Well, she ain't no John Wilkes Booth 

93
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,078
but maybe you might heard tell

94
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,032
about the price on her head.

95
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,913
How much?
$10,000.

96
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,599
Damn.

97
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,070
What'd she do, kill Lily Langtry?

98
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,793
Not quite.

99
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,799
That ten thousand's practically in my pocket.

100
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,277
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides 

101
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,830
especially to professionals open for business.

102
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,474
I can certainly appreciate that.

103
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,434
But I ain't got no designs on her.

104
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,200
One of my fellas over there is worth $4,000 

105
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,358
another one's worth $3,000 and one of 'em's worth $1,000.

106
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,914
That's damn sure good enough for me.

107
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,074
Well...let me see their paperwork.

108
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,432
Like I said, molasses-like.

109
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,270
Back off.

110
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,317
Look, I sure hate to interrupt you all 

111
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,070
but we got a cold damn blizzard
that's hot on our ass

112
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,998
that we're tryin' to beat to shelter!

113
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,510
I realize that!
Now, shut your mouth

114
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,235
and hold them damn horses while I think!

115
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,355
Okay, boy, we'll give it a try.

116
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,718
But you leave them two pistols
over yonder with the driver.

117
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,030
Hey, uh, you ain't really gonna let that nigger

118
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,560
ride in here, is ya?

119
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,240
I mean, maybe up there with O.B., but...

120
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,516
How ya like the sound of them bells, bitch?

121
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,994
They real pretty, ain't they?

122
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,398
You open up your trashy mouth again 

123
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,273
I'll knock out them front teeth for ya.

124
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,392
You got it?

125
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,273
Yeah.

126
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,517
Let me hear ya say, 'I got it.

127
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,080
I got it.

128
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,432
Uh, I'm gonna need a hand tyin'
these fellas up on the roof.

129
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,120
Give O.B. $50 when we get to Red Rock.

130
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
He'll help ya.

131
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,874
Well, I agree with O.B.

132
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,639
This storm got me concerned.

133
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,911
We get goin' a lot quicker you helped out, too.

134
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,953
Goddamn it to hell I'm already regrettin' this.

135
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,959
Now, I can't likely help you
tie fellas to the roof

136
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,560
with my wrist cuffed to hers.

137
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,478
And my wrist is gonna stay cuffed to hers 

138
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,592
and she ain't never gonna leave my goddamn side

139
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,554
till I personally put her in the Red Rock jail!

140
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,319
Now, do you got that?!

141
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,079
Yeah, I got it.

142
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,634
Good.

143
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,879
Get in, Dude!

144
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
Hut! Get in!

145
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,274
Go on! Hut!

146
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,754
Come on!

147
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,430
Dude, Coconut, giddyup.

148
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,920
Yah!

149
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,910
Hut!

150
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,597
Giddyup!

151
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,276
Yah! Cimarron!
Leche! Get in!

152
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,357
So, what happened to your horse?

153
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,994
Get in!

154
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,873
He was kinda old.

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,674
I done had him for a bit.

156
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,837
When the weather took
a turn for the worse 

157
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,953
well, he done what he could
but he couldn't make it.

158
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,390
Get in!
That's too bad.

159
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,716
Yeah, it is.

160
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,878
Me and ol' Lash done rode
a lot of miles together.

161
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,912
Could say he was my best friend 

162
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,154
if I considered stupid animals
friends, which I don't.

163
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,715
Nevertheless, I'm gonna miss him.

164
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,397
Leche! Ha!

165
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,671
Who's this Daisy Domergue?

166
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,480
A no damn good murdering bitch, that's who.

167
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,193
Come on, boys! Get up!

168
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,800
I see you ain't got mixed emotions

169
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,400
about bringing a woman to a rope.

170
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,359
By 'woman', you mean her?

171
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,989
No, I do not have mixed emotions.

172
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,440
Get in! Ha!

173
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,711
So you taking her into Red Rock to hang.

174
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,035
You bet.

175
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
You gonna wait round to watch it?

176
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,994
Oh, you know I am.

177
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,271
Come on! I want to hear her neck snap

178
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,720
with my own two ears.

179
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,559
Get up, boys!

180
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,115
You never wait to watch 'em hang?
Get up!

181
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,197
My bounties never hang 

182
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,551
cause I never bring 'em in alive.

183
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,990
Never?
Never ever.

184
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,820
Ha! Get up! Yah!
We talked about this in Chattanooga.

185
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,109
Bringing desperate men in alive's

186
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,674
a good way to get yourself dead.

187
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,718
Get in there!
Can't catch me sleeping

188
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,115
if I don't close my eyes.

189
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,640
I don't want to work that hard.

190
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,592
No one said the job is supposed to be easy.

191
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,757
No one said it's supposed
to be that hard, neither.

192
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,759
Get up, boys! Ha!
But that, little lady 

193
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,758
is why they call him 'The Hangman.

194
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,440
When the handbill says 'Dead or Alive' 

195
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,358
the rest of us shoot ya in the back

196
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,039
from up on top of a perch somewhere 

197
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,913
bring ya in dead over a saddle.
Get in!

198
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,716
But when John Ruth The Hangman catches ya 

199
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,832
you don't die from no bullet in the back.

200
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,553
Mm-mm.

201
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,434
When The Hangman catches you, you hang.

202
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,473
Ha!

203
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,717
You overrate him, nigger.

204
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,476
I give ya he got guts but in the brains department 

205
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,389
he like a man who took a high dive in a low well.

206
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,078
Now, Daisy 

207
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,910
I want us to work out a signal
system of communication.

208
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,320
When I elbow you real hard in
the face, that means 'shut up.

209
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,840
You got it?

210
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,759
I got it.

211
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,669
Get in there!

212
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,717
Come on now, boys, get in!

213
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,510
* Hey, little apple blossom *

214
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,436
* What seems to be the problem? *

215
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,877
* All the ones you tell your troubles to *

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,040
* They don't really care for you *

217
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,358
* Come and tell me what you're thinking *

218
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,918
* 'Cause just when the boat is sinking *

219
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,351
* A little light is blinking *

220
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,474
* And I will come and rescue you *

221
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,230
* Lots of girls walk around in tears *

222
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,990
* But that's not for you *

223
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,840
* You've been looking all around for years *

224
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,034
* For someone to tell your troubles to *
Ha!

225
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,040
* Come and sit with me and talk a while *

226
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,995
* Let me see your pretty little smile *

227
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,079
* Put your troubles in a little pile *

228
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,830
* And I will sort them out for you, all right. *

229
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,997
Hyah!

230
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
Get in!

231
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,280
Get in there!

232
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,040
Mm.

233
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,879
Giddyup!

234
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,349
I, uh...I know we only met
each other the once before 

235
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,951
and, uh, I don't mean to
unduly imply intimacy, get up!

236
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,790
But, well Yah!

237
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,912
You still got it?

238
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,235
Do I still got what?

239
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,800
Get in, now!

240
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,037
The Lincoln letter.

241
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,799
Mm. Course.

242
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,230
Get up, boys!

243
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,874
Got it on ya?
Mm-hmm.

244
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,877
Come on!

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Where?

246
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,793
Right here.

247
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,559
Come on, boys! Get up!

248
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,880
Look, I know you got to be
real careful with it and all 

249
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,714
and I can imagine you probably
don't like taking it

250
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,678
in and out of the envelope all that often 

251
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,672
but, uh Get up!

252
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,720
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd sure appreciate seeing that again.

253
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,274
Get in, boys!

254
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,552
Ha! Giddyup!

255
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,909
You're right.

256
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,157
I don't like taking it in and out

257
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,431
of the envelope that much.
I...Yeah.

258
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,914
But Get in!

259
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,919
Seeing's how you saved my life and all 

260
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,111
I suppose I could let you read it again.

261
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,317
Get in! Ha!

262
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,909
Get in there!

263
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,117
Get up now!

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,434
Get in!

265
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,960
Giddyup!

266
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,037
Huh!

267
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,317
Get in, now!

268
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,273
Get in!

269
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,114
Ole Mary Todd's calling,
so I guess it must be time for bed.

270
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,038
Ole Mary Todd.

271
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,595
Ha!

272
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,996
Get in!

273
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,351
Well, that Get up, boys!

274
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
That gets me.

275
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,677
Yeah, it gets me, too.

276
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,638
Get in! Get in!

277
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,838
You know what this is, tramp?
Hmm?

278
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,191
It's a letter from Lincoln.

279
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,789
Letter from Lincoln to him.
Get in there!

280
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,195
Yeah.

281
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,277
They shared a correspondence during the war.

282
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,794
They was pen pals.

283
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,799
And this is just one of the letters.
Get up!

284
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,233
What the 

285
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,397
Hyah!
O.B.!

286
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,795
Stop!

287
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Whoa!

288
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,070
Easy.

289
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,520
Whoa!

290
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,756
All the stupid 

291
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,355
Like to rip my goddamn arm off!

292
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,470
I didn't drag her stinking ass
up this goddamn mountain

293
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,910
just for you to break her neck
on the outskirts of town!

294
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,600
You the one handed her my goddamn letter!

295
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,234
I didn't give it to her 

296
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,317
I give it to you!

297
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,677
That nigger like to bust my jaw.

298
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,154
You ruin that letter of his 

299
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,237
that nigger gonna stomp your ass to death.

300
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,592
And when he do, I'm gonna sit
back on that wagon wheel 

301
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,870
watch and laugh!

302
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,753
How is it?

303
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,712
Well, she ain't help it none.

304
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,672
But it's all right.

305
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,510
Is that the way niggers treat their ladies?

306
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,109
You ain't no goddamn lady!

307
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,674
Hey, Mr.Ruth!

308
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,399
What?

309
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,796
There's another fella on
foot up here on the road.

310
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,151
Hey!

311
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,112
What?!

312
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,190
I said there's another fella
on foot, up here on the road.

313
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,199
Hey! Hey!

314
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,074
Considering there's a blizzard going on 

315
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,759
whole lot of fellas walking around 

316
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,400
wouldn't you say, Major?

317
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,398
Well, seeing as how I'm half of them fellas 

318
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,716
uh, yeah, seems to be a lot of us.

319
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,715
This changes things, son.

320
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,311
$8,000 a lot of money for a nigger.

321
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,591
With a partner, 18's a whole lot better.

322
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,157
You really think I'm in cahoots
with that fella, or her?!

323
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,600
Put them on.

324
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,080
Oh, I...I ain't wearing no handcuffs.

325
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,072
You put those on, or you can stop

326
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,510
worrying about this whole thing right now!

327
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,273
Hey!

328
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,559
Hey!

329
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,789
Hand your weapons to the driver.

330
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,798
Little jumpy, ain't you?

331
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,799
Never mind the jokes.
Just do it.

332
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,354
If you say so.

333
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,477
I do.

334
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,238
Okay.

335
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,714
I done done it.

336
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,599
O.B., you got 'em?

337
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
I got 'em.

338
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,599
Okay, fella.

339
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,116
You keep holding that lantern in that one hand 

340
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,358
and you keep that other hand where I can see it.

341
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,200
Walk over there where I can
get a good look at ya.

342
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,189
Well, I'll be a goddamn dog in a manger.

343
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,074
Is that you, Chris Mannix?

344
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,078
I'm sorry, friend, do we know each other?

345
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Not quite.

346
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,595
You know this fella?

347
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,837
Only by reputation.

348
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,994
Like I said, friend, you got me
at a bit of a disadvantage.

349
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,520
Keeping you at a disadvantage

350
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,791
is an advantage I intend to keep.

351
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,913
Uh, whoever you are, mister you sure sound tough

352
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,112
when you talking to a desperate
man knee-deep in snow.

353
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,709
I...I...I don't want no trouble.

354
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,910
I just want a ride.

355
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,271
I...I'm freezing to death!

356
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,920
Who is this joker?

357
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,637
You heard of the rebel renegade Erskine Mannix?

358
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,717
Mannix's Marauders?
That's them.

359
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,878
Scourge of South Carolina, Mannix's Marauders.

360
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,310
It's Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.

361
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,671
Brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?

362
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,191
Well, Mr.Face, I was riding to Red Rock 

363
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,676
my horse stepped in a gopher hole in the snow 

364
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,110
fucked up his leg, had to put 'er down.

365
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,674
You got business in Red Rock?

366
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,320
Yes, I do.
What?

367
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,033
I'm the new sheriff.

368
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,674
Horseshit.

369
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,678
Fraid not.
Where's your star?

370
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,393
Well, I ain't the sheriff yet.

371
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,318
Now, once I get there, they swear me in.

372
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,079
But, uh, that ain't happened yet.

373
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,714
And-and that's when you get your star.

374
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,991
You got anything that can
back any of this up?

375
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,351
Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.

376
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,439
And-and from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there 

377
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,075
I...I figure you a bounty hunter
open for business.

378
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,200
And-and I figure you taking
them three dead bodies

379
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,232
into Red Rock to get paid?

380
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,510
Three dead.

381
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
One alive.

382
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,557
Who's that?

383
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,353
Daisy Domergue.

384
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,517
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?

385
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,156
Not a goddamn thing to nobody
except me and the hangman.

386
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,555
The hangman?

387
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,397
Well, I'll be double-dog damned.

388
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,034
You're 'The Hangman' Bob Ruth!

389
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,276
It's John.

390
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,631
And you!

391
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,399
You're the nigger with the head!

392
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,552
Major Marquis!

393
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,797
My Lord, is that really the real head

394
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,151
of Major Marquis looking at me now?

395
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,755
Yeah, it's really me and it's really my head.

396
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,553
So what's going on?

397
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,399
Uh, y'all having a bounty hunter's picnic?

398
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,954
Never mind.

399
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,799
Uh, you taking them three dead bodies

400
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,798
and-and hurrying to Red Rock
to get paid, ain't you?

401
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,149
Yeah.

402
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,634
Well, the man in Red Rock's

403
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,390
supposed to pay you is me, the new sheriff.

404
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,273
So if y'all want to get paid 

405
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,392
y'all need to get me to Red Rock.

406
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,398
Well, excuse me for finding it hard to believe

407
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,070
a town electing you to do
anything except drop dead.

408
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,793
So I'm supposed to freeze to death

409
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,116
cause you find something hard to believe?

410
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,792
No, I suppose not.

411
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,597
Put them on and come inside.

412
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,432
No.

413
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,514
Then you'll freeze.

414
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,279
Then you'll hang.

415
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,437
How so?

416
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,634
Stagecoach driver, could you
come down here and join us?

417
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,234
I got to hold these horses.

418
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,477
I can hear you just fine from up here.

419
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,472
Well, you just heard me tell this fella

420
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,838
I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?

421
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Yeah.

422
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,469
Red Rock is my town now.

423
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,990
And I'm gonna enter my town
in bounty hunter's chains?

424
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,474
No, sir!

425
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,954
Sorry, bushwhackers 

426
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,231
I ain't entering Red Rock
that way.

427
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,079
Now, when you finally get to Red Rock 

428
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,119
you gonna realize every Goddamn
thing I said was right.

429
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,516
And I expect you, O.B. 

430
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,030
to tell the townsfolk
of Red Rock

431
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,994
that John Ruth let their
new sheriff freeze to death.

432
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,998
Ain't no bounty on my head, bushwhacker.

433
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,192
You let me die, that's murder.

434
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,277
Hold out your hands.

435
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,878
O.B.!

436
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,957
Give the major back his iron.

437
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,433
One thing I know for sure 

438
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,233
this nigger-hating son of a gun

439
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,517
ain't partnered up with you.

440
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,712
Now, I'll help you protect your $8,000

441
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,877
you help me protect my ten.

442
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,673
Deal?

443
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,118
Well, ain't love grand?

444
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,709
Y'all want to lie on the ground
and make snow angels together?

445
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,790
Hut!

446
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,111
Come on!

447
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,197
Hyah!

448
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,514
Well, I'll tell you what, Bob.

449
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,909
The name's John.

450
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,600
When we get to Red Rock Hyah!

451
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,239
I'll buy you and Major Marquis there

452
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,720
dinner and booze.
Get in!

453
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,115
My way of saying thanks.

454
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,596
I don't drink with rebel renegades 

455
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,155
and I damn sure don't break bread with them.

456
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,357
Well, Mr.Ruth Get up, boys!

457
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,800
You sound like you got

458
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,559
a axe to grind against the Cause.

459
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,593
The Cause' of a renegade army?
Get in!

460
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,757
Bunch of losers gone loco.

461
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,599
You bet I do.
Get up there! Hyah!

462
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,320
You wrapped yourselves up in a rebel flag

463
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,874
as an excuse to kill and steal.

464
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,396
And this ought to interest you, Warren.

465
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,910
Imparticular, emancipated blacks.

466
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,599
Sounds like my kind of fella.

467
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,713
Sound to me you been reading

468
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,629
a lot of newspapers printed in Washington, D.C.

469
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,719
Get in! Huh!
Anywho, I'm just trying

470
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,911
to let y'all know how grateful I am.

471
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,599
I was a goner.

472
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,074
And y'all saved me.

473
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,510
You want to show me how grateful you are?

474
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,393
Get in there!
Shut up.

475
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,116
Goddamn it, Daisy.

476
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,193
It's coming.

477
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,640
Get in there, Cimarron!

478
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,910
Here.

479
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Last piece.

480
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,840
Get in!

481
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,276
Get in, now!

482
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,471
Hyah!

483
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,432
Does he know 

484
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,233
Does he know how famous you once was?

485
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,589
I don't think so.

486
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,274
Giddyup!

487
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,039
Black Eye.

488
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,240
Do you know who he is?
Get in!

489
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,749
Do I know about the $30,000 reward

490
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,190
the Confederacy put on the
head of Major Marquis?

491
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,913
Come on now, boys!

492
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,474
Get in!
Yeah.

493
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,432
Ah, them hillbillies
went nigger head-hunting.

494
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,153
Get in!
They just never did get 'em

495
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,436
the right nigger head, did they?

496
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,472
No, they didn't.

497
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,000
But it wasn't for lack of trying.

498
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,674
Get in, boys! Ha! Get on!

499
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,640
Them peckerwoods left their homes and families 

500
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,514
and come up this snowy mountain
looking for me and fortune.

501
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,438
Ha! Get up!

502
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,153
Ain't none of 'em found fortune.

503
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,193
The ones you ain't never heard of no more 

504
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,073
they found me.

505
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,396
Now, it didn't stay $30,000
the length of the war.

506
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,874
Once passions cooled 

507
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,400
it dropped down to eight, then five.

508
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,675
Get up, boys! Ha!

509
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,917
But I bet even when it was 5,000 

510
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,680
you had your share of country boys coming to call.

511
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,918
Mm, you know I did.

512
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,680
Why'd they have
a reward on you?

513
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,190
Confederates took exception to
my capacity for killing 'em.

514
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,800
Get up, now!

515
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,911
And after I broke out of Wellenbeck 

516
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,794
well, the South took
my continued existence

517
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,673
as a personal affront.
Get up!

518
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,679
And the Cause put a reward on my head.
Hmm.

519
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,836
Get in there!

520
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,469
What's, uh, Wellenbeck?

521
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,114
You ain't never heard

522
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,594
of Wellenbeck prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?

523
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,552
No, reb, I ain't never heard of it.

524
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,512
Hyah!
Did you bust out?

525
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,074
Oh 

526
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,432
Major Marquis did more than bust out.

527
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,279
Major Marquis had a bright idea.

528
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,470
Get in, now!

529
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,916
So bright, you got to wonder

530
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,350
why nobody never thought about it before.

531
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,917
Tell John Ruth your bright idea.

532
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,070
Well, the whole damn place

533
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,594
was just made out of kindling.

534
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,995
Get in!

535
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,600
So I burnt it down.

536
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,231
Get in! Hyah!

537
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,636
There was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp.

538
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,832
47 men burnt to a crisp.

539
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,998
Southern youth, farmer's sons Get up!

540
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,236
Cream of the crop.

541
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,953
And I say, 'Let 'em burn.

542
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,517
I'm supposed to apologize
for killing Johnny Reb?

543
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,354
You joined the war to keep niggers in chains.

544
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,352
I joined the war to kill

545
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,080
white Southern crackers.
Ha! Get up!

546
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,237
And that means killing 'em any way I can.

547
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,517
Get in!
Shoot 'em, stab 'em 

548
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,472
drown 'em, burn 'em 

549
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,910
drop a big ol' rock on their head.

550
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,633
Whatever it took to put
white Southern crackers

551
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,513
in the ground, get up!

552
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,393
That's what I joined the war to do.

553
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,749
And that's what I did.

554
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,917
To answer your question, John Ruth 

555
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,960
when Major Marquis burned 47 men alive 

556
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,879
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees 

557
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,798
that's when the South put a reward

558
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,195
on the head of Major Marquis.

559
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,073
And I made them trees, Mannix.
Get in!

560
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,919
You best believe I ain't looked back

561
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,793
till I crossed the Northern line.

562
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,639
Oh, but you had a surprise waiting for you

563
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,831
on the Northern side, didn't you?

564
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,713
See, once they started pulling out

565
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,309
all them burnt bodies at Wellenbeck 

566
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,790
seems not all them boys were rebs.

567
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,833
Why, you burn up some of your own boys 

568
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,314
didn't you, Major?

569
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,796
How many burnt prisoners
they end up finding?

570
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,718
Wasn't the final Yankee death count

571
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,309
something like 37?

572
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,800
Giddyup!

573
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,593
That's the thing about war, Mannix.

574
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,154
People die.

575
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,600
Oh!

576
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,792
So you gonna chalk it up
to 'war is hell', huh?

577
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,350
Well, admittedly, that is a hard argument to argue with.

578
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,358
But if memory serves 

579
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,837
your side didn't look at it that way.

580
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,350
I think they thought 37 white men

581
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,836
for one nigger

582
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,111
wasn't so hot a trade.

583
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,517
I do believe they accused you Giddyup!

584
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,915
Of being a kill-crazy nigger

585
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,111
who only joined the war
to kill white folks 

586
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,879
and the whole blue and gray of it all

587
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,036
really didn't matter that much to you.

588
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,594
Ha! Get up!

589
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,712
And that's why they drummed your black ass

590
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,230
out of the cavalry with a
yellow stripe down your back.

591
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,512
Get in!
Isn't it, Major?

592
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,994
Horseshit!

593
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,600
If he'd have did all that, the cavalry

594
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,080
would've shot him.
Get in!

595
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,720
Well, I didn't say they could prove it.

596
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,160
Get up!
But they sure did

597
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,192
think it out loud, didn't they, Major?

598
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,152
Hyah! Get up, boys!

599
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,920
But Warren's war record was stellar 

600
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,396
and that's what saved his ass.

601
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,670
Hyah!

602
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,598
Now, you killed yourself your share

603
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,999
of redskins in your day didn't you, Black Major?

604
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,112
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.

605
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,119
I'll tell you what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.

606
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,799
Giddyup!
Mannix's Marauders 

607
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,559
that's what.
Get in! Hyah!

608
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,751
And the fact that Erskine Mannix's little boy

609
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,758
would talk about anybody else's behavior

610
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,271
during war time makes me want to horse-laugh.

611
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,629
Hyah!

612
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,878
Don't you say anything about my daddy.

613
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,397
What he fought for was dignity in defeat Get up there!

614
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,830
And against the unconditional surrender.

615
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,397
We weren't foreign barbarians
pounding on the city walls.

616
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,512
Ha!
We were your brothers.

617
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,000
Get up, now!

618
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,918
We deserved dignity in defeat.

619
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,794
Just how many nigger towns did y'all sack

620
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,310
in your fight for dignity in defeat?

621
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,756
Oh, my fair share, Black Major.

622
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,475
Cause when niggers are scared, huh!

623
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,478
That's when white folks are safe.

624
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,074
You gonna talk that hateful nigger talk 

625
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,438
you can ride up top with O.B.

626
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,755
No.

627
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,439
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

628
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,029
You done got me talking politics.

629
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,277
I didn't want to.

630
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,438
Like I said, y'all I'm just happy to be alive.

631
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,597
Get in, now!

632
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,592
Ha! Get up!

633
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,832
I think I'll scoot over here
right by this window 

634
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,432
and let this beautiful carriage rock me to sleep.

635
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,354
And dream about how lucky I am.

636
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,037
Get up, now!

637
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,514
Ha!

638
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,999
Hyah! Get in!

639
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,435
Get in there!

640
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,789
Get in, hyah!

641
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,115
Get in there!

642
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,038
Get in!

643
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,913
Get in there, Leche!

644
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,838
Get in there!

645
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,032
Whoa, whoa, easy.

646
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,153
Whoa! Whoa!

647
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,393
What the hell is going on?

648
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,433
We weren't expecting another stage tonight!

649
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,600
Yeah, I can see you already
got another one up in here.

650
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,360
Just got through putting the horses away.

651
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,199
Well, this ain't the normal line 

652
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,199
but we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard 

653
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,551
so it looks like you're stuck with us.

654
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,677
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?

655
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,280
They ain't here.

656
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,676
I'm running the place while they're gone.

657
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,357
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

658
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,318
He says they ain't here.

659
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,676
He's looking after the place while they're gone.

660
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,156
Who are you?

661
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,475
I'm Bob.

662
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,953
Well, whoever you are help O.B. with the horses.

663
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,112
Come on.

664
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,233
Get 'em out of this cold 'fore
that blizzard hits us.

665
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,829
Whoa! You all right?

666
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

667
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,276
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

668
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,790
I just put those other horses away.

669
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,958
You need it done fast you need to help.

670
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,549
I got two of my best men on it.

671
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,116
You heard him, freeloaders.

672
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,357
Get to work!

673
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,989
All right, you two, unhook the leaders.

674
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,395
Come on, let's go.

675
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,113
Open up!

676
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,754
You have to kick it open!
Ya got to kick it open!

677
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,757
What?

678
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,360
Kick it open!

679
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,278
Shut that door.

680
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,550
There's a goddamn blizzard out there!

681
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,034
You have to stop, close the door!

682
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,429
You got to nail it shut.

683
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,314
You have to, you have to nail it shut!

684
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,794
Hold it shut!

685
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,639
There's a hammer and nails by the door!

686
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,160
You have to nail it shut!

687
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,352
There's a hammer and nails by the door.

688
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,358
Give me a hammer.
Yeah.

689
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,873
You need, you need two pieces of wood!

690
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,719
You need two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!

691
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,069
Two pieces of wood!

692
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,556
The fuckin' thing is busted!

693
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,400
Not just one piece of wood!

694
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,920
Give me another piece of wood.

695
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,917
Yeah. All right.

696
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,993
I need a nail.
Here.

697
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,559
Jesus.

698
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,711
That door's a son of a gun.

699
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,638
Who's the idiot who broke that 

700
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,717
that Mexican fella?

701
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,194
Oh, good heavens!

702
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,640
A woman?

703
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,080
Out in this white hell?

704
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,398
You must be frozen solid, poor thing.

705
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,800
Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.

706
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,237
When did you fellas arrive?

707
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,396
Ah.

708
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,432
About 40 minutes ago.

709
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,313
That cowboy fella in the corner 

710
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,352
that your driver?
No, no, he's a passenger.

711
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,392
The driver lit out.

712
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,318
Said he was going to spend the blizzard

713
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,510
shacked up with a friend.

714
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,235
Lucky devil.

715
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,477
Jesus Christ, that's awful!

716
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,115
Christ Almighty 

717
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,233
what'd that Mexican fella do soak his old socks in a pot?

718
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,955
Yes, uh...I...I think we all felt the same way 

719
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,152
but were a little too polite to say something.

720
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,556
He don't have that problem.
Shit.

721
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,353
Where's the well water?

722
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,994
Uh, over there.

723
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,396
So, all three of you fellas headed to Red Rock

724
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,274
when the blizzard stopped you, huh?

725
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,552
Yes. All three of us were on
that stagecoach out there.

726
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,480
Coffee beans.

727
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,155
Uh, over there.

728
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,436
Get your hand out of there.

729
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,160
New sheriff of Red Rock's
travelin' with us.

730
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,159
Ah, sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.

731
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,114
He's a goddamn sheriff I'm a monkey's uncle.

732
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,310
Good.

733
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,635
Then you can share bananas

734
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,319
with your nigger friend in the stable.

735
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,671
So 

736
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,036
the new sheriff of Red Rock
is traveling with you?

737
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,480
Oh, he's lying.

738
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,512
He ain't sheriff of nothin.

739
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,552
He's a Southern renegade.

740
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,359
He's just talking hisself

741
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,233
out of freezing to death is all.

742
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,317
What the fuck I tell you about talking, huh?

743
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,954
I'll bust you in the mouth

744
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,311
right in front of these people.
I don't give a fuck!

745
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,994
You never gave your name, sir.

746
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,237
John Ruth.

747
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,470
Are you a lawman?

748
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,954
I'm taking her to the law.

749
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,434
So you're a bounty hunter?

750
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,791
That's right, buster.

751
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,599
Do you have a warrant?

752
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,040
Yeah, course I do.

753
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,435
May I see it?

754
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,359
Why?

755
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,552
Ah! You're supposed to produce it upon request.

756
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,400
How am I supposed to know
you're not a villain 

757
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,910
kidnapping this woman 

758
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,997
without a warrant in your possession?

759
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,753
What's your name, buster?

760
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,794
Well, it certainly isn't Buster.

761
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,391
It's Oswaldo Mobray.

762
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,914
Oswaldo?

763
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,474
Yes.

764
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,592
Well 

765
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,997
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.

766
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,556
I take it you're Daisy Domergue?

767
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,273
That's her.
Yeah.

768
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,513
I see.

769
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,597
Uh, it says here 'Dead or Alive.

770
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,552
Yeah. It does.

771
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,717
Well, transporting a desperate 

772
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,230
hostile prisoner such as her

773
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,198
sounds like hard work.

774
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,273
Wouldn't transporting her be easier

775
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,834
if she were dead?

776
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,634
Well, no one said the job
was supposed to be easy.

777
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,275
And why is her hanging proper
so important to you?

778
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,198
Let's just say I don't like
cheatin' the hangman.

779
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,993
He got to make a living, too.

780
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,476
Well, I appreciate that.

781
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,479
Allow me to properly

782
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,478
introduce myself.

783
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,512
I'm Oswaldo Mobray 

784
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,030
the hangman in these parts.

785
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,038
La-di-da.
Ah.

786
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,640
Looks like I brought you a customer.

787
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,876
Yeah, so it would appear.

788
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,753
You ever spent two days or more

789
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,952
locked up with one of your customers before?

790
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,072
I can't say I have.
Don't talk to my prisoner.

791
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,634
I talk to my prisoner, that's it.

792
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,830
You got it?
I got it.

793
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,155
Jolly good.

794
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,873
You got anything in here
besides coffee

795
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,753
that can help warm us up?

796
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,076
Well, the bar is open.

797
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,840
Follow moi.

798
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,313
Line, O.B.!

799
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,079
Oh, whoa.

800
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,714
Oh!

801
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,153
Whoa!

802
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,640
Hey.

803
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,520
Whoa, Ace, whoa.

804
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,912
You're all right, you're all right.

805
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,793
Come on, goddamn it.
I'm cold!

806
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,357
I'll feed and water the horses.

807
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,439
You go inside and get some hot coffee.

808
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,040
Got some stew cooking.

809
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,236
Should be done soon.

810
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,589
Now, look.

811
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,111
No matter how bad this blizzard gets 

812
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,357
we still got to feed these horses

813
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,075
and take a squat from time to time.

814
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,272
So me and Chris better lay out a line

815
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,551
from the stable to the front door

816
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,554
and from the front door to the shithouse.

817
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,200
Okay?

818
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,233
Good idea.

819
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,999
Come on, Chris.

820
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,154
I'll give you a hand.

821
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,394
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Go inside. Get warm.

822
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,360
You're doin' stable work
in a goddamn blizzard.

823
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,199
I offer to help, you say no?

824
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,797
You're right, amigo.

825
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,798
Muchas gracias.

826
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,872
All right. Follow me.

827
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,476
We're gonna drop one every ten paces 

828
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,199
from here to the door.
Yeah!

829
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,118
All right!

830
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,350
Now, you're wanted for murder.

831
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,517
For the sake of my analogy 

832
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,677
let's just assume that you did it.

833
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,917
Now, John Ruth wants to take
you back to Red Rock

834
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,952
to stand trial for murder.

835
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,198
And if you're found guilty 

836
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,913
the people of Red Rock

837
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,952
will hang you in the town square.

838
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,878
And, as the hangman 

839
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,198
I will perform the execution.

840
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,915
And if all those things

841
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,872
end up taking place 

842
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,993
that's what civilized society

843
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,431
calls justice.

844
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,438
However 

845
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,712
if the relatives and the loved ones

846
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,593
of the person you murdered

847
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,279
were outside that door right now 

848
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,710
and after busting down that door 

849
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,275
they drug you out into the snow

850
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,437
and hung you up by the neck 

851
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,917
that would be frontier justice.

852
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,953
Now, the good part

853
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,799
about frontier justice

854
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,550
is it's very thirst-quenching.

855
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,118
The bad part is it's
apt to be wrong as right.

856
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,560
Well, not in your case.

857
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,040
In your case, you'd have it coming.

858
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,272
But other people, maybe not so much.

859
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,790
But ultimately, what's the real difference

860
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,400
between the two?

861
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,150
The real difference is me.

862
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,760
The hangman.

863
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,633
To me, it doesn't matter what you did.

864
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,041
When I hang you, I'll get no
satisfaction from your death.

865
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,190
It's my job.

866
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,754
I hang you in Red Rock.

867
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,593
I move on to the next town.

868
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,555
I hang someone else there.

869
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,799
The man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck

870
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,799
will be a dispassionate man.

871
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,199
And that dispassion is the
very essence of justice.

872
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,109
For justice delivered without dispassion

873
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,871
is always in danger
of not being justice.

874
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,400
Amen.

875
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,080
No offense, cowboy fella.

876
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,113
Just gettin' your attention.

877
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,631
Yeah, well 

878
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,672
you got it.

879
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,440
What you writin', friend?

880
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,836
Only thing I'm qualified to write about.

881
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,111
What's that?

882
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,237
My life story.

883
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,033
You're writing your life story?

884
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,554
You bet I am.

885
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,034
Am I in it?

886
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,713
You just entered.

887
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,879
Well, you like writing stories so much 

888
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,196
why don't you tell me the
story that brings you here?

889
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,039
Who's asking?

890
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,038
I am. John Ruth.

891
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,550
I'm bringing in this one
to Red Rock to hang.

892
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,871
And ain't no way I'm spending
a couple of nights

893
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,276
under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are 

894
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,914
and I don't know who you are.

895
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,997
So, who are you?

896
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,998
Joe Gage.

897
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,077
What?
That's my name.

898
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,395
Joe Gage.

899
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,318
Okay, Joe Gage.

900
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,159
Why you going to Red Rock?

901
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,312
I ain't, I ain't, I ain't going to Red Rock.

902
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,874
Where you going?

903
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,912
About nine miles outside of Red Rock.

904
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,116
What's there?

905
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,560
My mother.

906
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,955
Your mother?

907
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,117
Listen, I'm just a cowpuncher.

908
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,280
I just, uh, got back from a long drive, and 

909
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,917
and I wasn't just an ass
in a saddle this time.

910
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,396
I was a partner.

911
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,309
First time in my life
I made a pretty penny.

912
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,999
And, uh 

913
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,510
figured I'd come home

914
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,313
and spend time with my mother

915
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,153
for Christmas.

916
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,794
Now, that's funny.

917
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,913
Cause you don't look like

918
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,633
the coming-home-for-Christmas
type.

919
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,310
Yeah, well 

920
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,512
you know, looks can be deceiving.

921
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,519
Because I definitely am a

922
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,520
coming-home-for-Christmas-to-spend-time-with-Mother type.

923
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,959
Christmas with Mother, I mean, uh 

924
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,072
it's a wonderful thing.

925
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,996
Now, is that, uh 

926
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,793
good enough for you 

927
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,196
John Ruth?

928
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,472
For now.

929
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,115
You steer clear of my prisoner.

930
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,637
Hello, old-timer.

931
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,193
General.

932
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,840
General.

933
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,671
You, sir, are a hyena.

934
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,830
I have no wish to speak to you.

935
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,557
I've been called worse.

936
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,831
Fair enough, General.

937
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,759
Sorry to bother you.

938
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,359
Hey!

939
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,320
You gotta kick it open!
Gotta kick it open!

940
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,033
What?
Kick it open!

941
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,640
That latch, you gotta kick it open!
You gotta kick it open!

942
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,515
Jesus Christ!

943
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,994
Close it!
Close it!

944
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,435
Close the door!
What?

945
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,994
Close it!
The goddamn door!

946
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,355
It doesn't have a latch.
Close it!

947
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,960
It's already cold enough in here!

948
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,593
Doesn't have a latch.

949
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,518
You gotta hammer up a board.
You gotta nail it shut!

950
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,920
The hammer and nails by the door.

951
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,509
There's a hammer and nails right there!

952
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,791
Ah, God!

953
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,230
Hold this here, Chris.
Here! Here.

954
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,474
Watch your fingers.
Yeah.

955
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,353
Really nail it in!
Yeah.

956
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,679
You need two pieces of wood.

957
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,553
You got to hammer another one.

958
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,433
One ain't good enough!

959
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,472
It's gonna blow right open!

960
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,670
Now, goddamn it!

961
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,553
Gonna open if you don't ham...!

962
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,239
Shut up!
Ah, got it!

963
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,636
Son of a bitch!

964
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,794
Jesus Christ.

965
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,798
That's door's a whore.

966
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,880
Oh!

967
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,639
I get it, 'Haberdashery.

968
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,592
That was a joke.

969
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,996
How's the coffee?

970
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,670
Now? Pretty good, if I do say so myself.

971
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,754
Thank you.

972
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,834
Ooh!

973
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,630
Ha! Navajo!

974
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,519
Guess who he is.

975
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,716
Buffalo Bill?

976
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,433
Hardly.

977
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,273
No. I'm 

978
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,119
Oswaldo Mobray.
I'm the 

979
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,277
He's the hangman of Red Rock.

980
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,550
Oh, you are?

981
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,717
Yes, I am.
Well!

982
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,400
Uh, good to meet you, uh.
Yeah.

983
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,954
Mr...?
Uh, Mobray.

984
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,150
Mobray.
Yeah.

985
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,316
I'm Chris Mannix.

986
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,840
The new sheriff in Red Rock.

987
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,191
Really?
Pfft, horseshit!

988
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,754
Pay no attention to him.

989
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,360
Horseshit!

990
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,200
Fella warmin' himself
by that potbelly stove

991
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,749
is a hell of a driver named O.B.
Ah.

992
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,310
That's the only thing
you've said that's the truth.

993
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,991
You comin' into Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson?

994
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,240
Precisely.
Do you have the execution orders on you?

995
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,873
In my bag.
May I see 'em?

996
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,593
Of course.

997
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,916
Who's, uh, who's Lance Lawson?

998
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,430
He's a fella been sittin' in the Red Rock jail

999
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,040
about a month now.

1000
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,231
He's the fella who shot the fella

1001
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,875
who was sheriff 'fore me.

1002
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,276
Precisely.

1003
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,077
Thank you.

1004
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,955
What did she mean when she said 

1005
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,914
The bounty hunter's nigger friend in the stable'?

1006
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,272
He's got a nigger bounty hunter
friend in the stable.

1007
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,517
But all that just to guard her?

1008
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,798
Uh, I don't think that was
the original idea, but 

1009
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,515
that's the idea now.
Oh! Mm.

1010
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,916
Want a little snake bite in your coffee?

1011
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,793
Yeah.

1012
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,434
Five of you?

1013
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,552
Well, well, well, looks like Minnie's Haberdashery

1014
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,070
is about to get cozy for the next few days.

1015
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,720
Yes, it does.

1016
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,800
Here.
Ah!Ah.

1017
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,072
Are you the chap with the Lincoln letter?

1018
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,998
The Lincoln what?

1019
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,591
Yes. The letter from Abraham Lincoln.

1020
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,752
President Abraham Lincoln?

1021
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,634
Yes. Weren't you pen pals?

1022
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,956
With the president?

1023
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,073
Well, I'm sorry, I heard that somebody in your party

1024
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,953
had a letter from Abraham Lincoln.

1025
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,560
I assumed it was you.

1026
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,955
Not him!

1027
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,754
Black fella in the stable.

1028
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,360
The nigger 

1029
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,757
in the stable has a letter
from Abraham Lincoln?

1030
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,519
Yeah.

1031
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,351
The nigger in the stable has
a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

1032
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,676
What'd you say your name was again?

1033
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,678
Bob.
Warren.

1034
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,031
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?

1035
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,277
Minnie and Sweet Dave went
to visit her mother

1036
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,153
on the north side of the mountain.

1037
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,714
What?
Yeah.

1038
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,160
Minnie ain't here?

1039
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,795
Yes, they're visiting her mother.

1040
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,991
Her mother?
Yes.

1041
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,554
Hmm.

1042
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,436
Never knew Minnie had a mother.

1043
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,519
Well, everybody's got a mother.

1044
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,952
Yeah, I suppose.

1045
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,991
And she left you in charge?

1046
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,474
Si.

1047
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,672
That sure don't sound like Minnie.

1048
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,031
Are you calling me a liar?

1049
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,469
Well, not yet I ain't.

1050
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,831
Just sounds peculiar is all.

1051
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,838
What sounds peculiar?

1052
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,997
Well, first off Minnie never struck me

1053
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,918
as the sentimental type.

1054
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,829
And secondly, I can't imagine
Sweet Dave lifting his fat ass

1055
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,720
out his chair long enough
to fetch well water

1056
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,076
unless Minnie was laying a
frying pan upside his head 

1057
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,192
let alone take a trip to the north side.

1058
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,551
Well, that sounds a whole lot

1059
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,275
like you're calling me a liar mi negro amigo.

1060
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,120
Yeah, it do sound a whole
lot like that, don't it?

1061
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,274
But I still ain't done it yet.

1062
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,353
Minnie still serve food?

1063
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,200
Do you consider stew food?
Yes.

1064
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,959
Then we serve food.

1065
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,676
She still stinking up the place
with Old Quail pipe tobacco?

1066
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,434
Minnie doesn't smoke a pipe.

1067
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,631
She rolls her own.

1068
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,320
Red Apple Tobacco.

1069
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,434
But, mi negro amigo I think you already know this.

1070
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,711
Yeah, I do, Senor Bob.

1071
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,400
Just seeing if you do.

1072
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,714
Come on!

1073
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,275
Fill 'er up, O.B.

1074
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,232
Yeah.

1075
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,317
Goddamn it.

1076
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,520
Thank you.

1077
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,837
Well, cut my legs off
and call me Shorty.

1078
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,237
Is that General Sanford Smithers I see?

1079
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,957
You got a good eye, son.

1080
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,233
Ha-ha! Well, I'll be double-dog damned!

1081
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,352
General Sandy 'Don't Give a Damn' Smithers?

1082
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,831
Captain Chris Mannix, Mannix's Marauders.

1083
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,480
Erskine's boy?

1084
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,273
Yes, sir.

1085
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,472
Uh...may I sit down, sir?

1086
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,320
Well, according to the Yankees it's a free country.

1087
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,672
General Sandy Smithers.
Ha-ha!

1088
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,996
Boy 

1089
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,634
oh, boy 

1090
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,037
did my daddy talk about you!

1091
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,836
I heard you gave those
Blue Bellies sweet hell.

1092
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,711
Me and my boys did our part.

1093
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,230
Just like Erskine and his boys
did their part.

1094
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,113
Hell yeah, we did.

1095
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,317
Yankee sons of bitches.

1096
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,751
I never knew your father, son.

1097
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,352
But I always respected
his resolve.

1098
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,517
Well, thank you for saying that, General.

1099
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,360
Your respect would have
meant the world to him.

1100
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,794
Can I get you some coffee?

1101
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,513
That'd be nice.

1102
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,717
Well, how about a blanket?

1103
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,152
That'd be even nicer.

1104
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,000
Hell, you know what?
You can have mine.

1105
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,392
Here we go, General.

1106
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,072
Ha-ha! So what brings you
out Wyoming way, sir?

1107
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,038
If you don't mind my askin.

1108
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,953
My boy.

1109
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,670
Oh, you got a boy that lives in Red Rock?
My son.

1110
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,229
Chester Charles Smithers.

1111
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,717
He died out here a few years back.

1112
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,951
Oh, forgive me, sir.

1113
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,356
There's no forgiveness needed, son.

1114
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,872
Like I said, it was a few years back.

1115
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,674
It was after he'd served his service.

1116
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,999
He came out here to the hills of Wyoming 

1117
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,918
to make his fortune.

1118
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,757
Never to be heard from again.

1119
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,280
I bought him a symbolic plot 

1120
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,632
in the Red Rock cemetery.

1121
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,118
And I'm here to advise a
stone maker on his headstone.

1122
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,630
Was he a goner for sure?

1123
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,837
No chance he could be livin' the cold life

1124
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,314
out in the woods?

1125
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,239
It's a rough life but folks can learn it.

1126
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,797
If he'd have done what he came out here to do 

1127
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,196
he'd have come home.

1128
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,395
Hold it. Close it, close it!

1129
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,439
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut.

1130
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,756
Well, who's the idiot
broke the damn door?

1131
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,360
Oh, j-j-j 

1132
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,790
just fucking hold it closed!

1133
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,197
Orale, cabron!

1134
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,836
Hold it closed.

1135
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,514
Okay.

1136
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,233
One more.

1137
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,034
Keep holding, keep holding 

1138
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,038
my negro amigo.

1139
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,159
We need two pieces of wood.

1140
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,151
Orale, cabron!
All right.

1141
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,749
There you go, motherfucker!

1142
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,676
Lot of hats, Senor Bob.

1143
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,314
Huh?

1144
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,397
Considering Minnie's 'no hats indoors' policy 

1145
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,432
which, if I remember correctly 

1146
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,472
was one of them Bar of Iron rules.

1147
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,195
Kind of rule she'd want 
kept up in her absence.

1148
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,198
You seem to have a laissez-faire attitude

1149
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,198
when it come to the hats.

1150
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,674
I'm guilty.

1151
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,480
I have a laissez-faire attitude about the hats.

1152
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,035
How about we forget
about the hats today

1153
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,959
considering there is a blizzard going on and on?

1154
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,436
We'll make tomorrow 'No Hat Day'!

1155
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,435
A large black dog.
* Now take my tip *

1156
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,199
* Before you ship to join *

1157
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,591
His name was Henry, I believe.
* The iron gang *

1158
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,598
Labrador.
* Don't be too gay *

1159
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,279
* In Botany Bay *

1160
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,235
* Or else you'll surely hang *

1161
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,511
* Or else you'll hang, you'll hang, said he...*

1162
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,279
You know, my daddy 

1163
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,039
I...I said that my-my daddy

1164
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,753
always said that Davis
A plum tree.

1165
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,434
Was a courageous man 

1166
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,233
but he should've put the capital

1167
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,876
in Montgomery and not Richmond.

1168
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,276
Yes, sir.
I agree with that.

1169
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,880
The army in northern Virginia would've been used

1170
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,753
in a very different way.
I said the army

1171
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,873
of north Virginia would've been
used in a very different way!

1172
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,959
* They'll flog the poaching out of you *

1173
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,311
* Out there in Botany Bay *

1174
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,318
Shut up!

1175
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,237
O.B.

1176
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,274
Do you know that nigger, sir?

1177
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,199
I don't know that nigger.

1178
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,712
But I know he's a nigger and that's all I need to know.

1179
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,074
Well 

1180
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,271
that nigger just ain't any nigger.

1181
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,834
That nigger, he 

1182
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,280
General Sanford Smithers?

1183
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,796
Battle of Baton Rouge?

1184
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,793
Inform the nigger

1185
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,913
in the cavalry officer's uniform

1186
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,714
that I had a division of Confederates

1187
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,071
under my command 

1188
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,112
in Baton Rouge.

1189
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,960
Major Nigger, General Smithers
wishes me to inform you 

1190
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,640
I heard him, hillbilly.

1191
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,312
Inform this old cracker that
I was in Baton Rouge also.

1192
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,874
On the other side.

1193
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,358
Oh, that's interesting.

1194
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,312
Uh, General Smithers 

1195
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,433
he said that he was also in
Baton Rouge on the other si 

1196
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,080
Captain Mannix 

1197
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,032
tell the nigger

1198
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,516
that I don't acknowledge niggers

1199
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,154
in Northern uniforms.

1200
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,152
You captured a whole colored command

1201
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,959
that day 

1202
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,357
but not one colored trooper
made it to a camp, did they?

1203
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,836
We didn't have the time
or the food 

1204
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,032
nor the inclination 

1205
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,516
to care for Northern horses

1206
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,836
and least of all 

1207
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,957
Northern niggers!

1208
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,673
So we shot 'em where they stood!

1209
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,196
Gentlemen.

1210
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,233
Gentlemen.

1211
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,955
I knowAmericans aren't apt

1212
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,914
to let a little thing like unconditional surrender

1213
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,680
get in the way of a good war.

1214
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,554
But I strongly suggest we don't restage

1215
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,990
the Battle of Baton Rouge

1216
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,680
during a blizzard in Minnie's Haberdashery.

1217
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,999
Now, uh 

1218
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,237
my Nubian friend 

1219
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,114
while I realize passions are high 

1220
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,197
that was a while ago.

1221
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,631
And if you shoot this unarmed old man 

1222
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,719
I guarantee I will hang you by the neck

1223
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,556
until you are dead once we arrive in Red Rock.

1224
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,716
I damn well guarantee that, too.

1225
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,194
Yeah, Warren 

1226
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,959
that's the problem with old men.

1227
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,912
You can kick 'em down the stairs

1228
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,431
and say it's a accident but you can't just shoot 'em.

1229
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,280
Uh, gentlemen...since we may be

1230
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,432
trapped here 

1231
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,438
close together-like 

1232
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,756
for a few days 

1233
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,271
may I suggest a possible solution?

1234
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,473
We divide Minnie's in half.

1235
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,637
The Northern side

1236
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,275
and the Southern side.

1237
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,154
With the dinner table 

1238
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,556
operating as a 

1239
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,558
neutral territory.

1240
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,679
We could say that the fireplace 

1241
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,156
side of the room acts as a 

1242
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,069
a symbolic representative of 

1243
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,714
Georgia.

1244
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,876
While the bar 

1245
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,639
represents 

1246
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,591
Philadelphia!

1247
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,713
Long as the bar's Philadelphia 

1248
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,752
I agree.

1249
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,999
We still got that deal we
talked about in the wagon?

1250
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,158
Thank you.
I help you protect your $8,000 

1251
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,671
you help me protect my ten?
Yeah, I suppose.

1252
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,558
One of them fellas

1253
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,151
is not what he says he is.

1254
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,794
What is he?

1255
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,913
In cahoots with this one, that's what he is.

1256
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,635
One of them, maybe even two of them 

1257
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,878
is here to see Domergue goes free.

1258
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,552
To accomplish that goal they'll kill everybody in here.

1259
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,512
They got 'em a couple of days 

1260
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,916
so all they got to do is sit tight

1261
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,437
and wait for a window of opportunity.

1262
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,120
And that's when they strike.

1263
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,435
Huh, bitch?

1264
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,075
If you say so, John.

1265
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,230
Are you sure you
ain't just being paranoid?

1266
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,239
Our best bet is this duplicitous fella

1267
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,273
ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here.

1268
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,035
He won't have the leather patience it takes

1269
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,880
to just sit here and...wait.

1270
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,196
Waiting for an opportunity

1271
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:45,558
and knowing it's the right one isn't so easy.

1272
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,433
He can't handle it 

1273
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,472
he'll stop waitin.

1274
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,557
Try and create his opportunity 

1275
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,878
and that's when Mr.Jumpy reveals himself.

1276
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,919
Now, what you got to say about all this?

1277
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,599
What do I got to say?

1278
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,599
About John Ruth's ravings?

1279
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,958
He's absolutely right.

1280
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,279
Me and one of them fellas is in cahoots.

1281
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,598
We're just waiting for everybody to go to sleep.

1282
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,235
That's when we're gonna kill y'all.

1283
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,314
Okay, everybody.

1284
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,434
Hear this.

1285
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,317
This here is Daisy Domergue.

1286
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,679
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.

1287
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,360
$10,000.

1288
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,120
That money's mine, boys.

1289
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,880
Don't want to share it 

1290
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,276
and I ain't gonna lose it.

1291
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,238
When that sun comes out 

1292
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,240
I'm taking this woman
into Red Rock to hang.

1293
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,794
Now 

1294
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,880
is there anybody here

1295
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,038
committed to stoppin' me 

1296
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,919
from doing that?

1297
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,198
Really?

1298
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,880
Nobody got a problem with this?

1299
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,954
Well 

1300
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,039
I guess that's very fortunate for me.

1301
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,840
However 

1302
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,237
I hope you all understand

1303
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,517
I can't just 

1304
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,552
take your word.

1305
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,320
Circumstances force me to 

1306
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,477
take 

1307
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,751
precautions.

1308
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,679
When you say 

1309
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,520
precautions' 

1310
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,190
why do I feel that you mean me?

1311
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,118
Because I'm gonna take your gun, son.

1312
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,799
You are?

1313
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,354
Yes, I am.

1314
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,712
Nothing personal.
Just mine?

1315
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,480
Hangman's got himself a gun, too.

1316
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,270
I'll be dealing with his gun
after I deal with yours.

1317
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,512
I feel kind of 

1318
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,518
naked without it.

1319
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,439
Oh, I still got mine.

1320
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,431
I'll protect you.

1321
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,111
A bastard's work is never done.

1322
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,311
Huh, John Ruth?

1323
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,433
That's right, Joe Gage.

1324
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,836
Now, give me the gun.
If you want it 

1325
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,397
you're gonna have to come and take 

1326
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,758
Calm down.

1327
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,519
Take your hand away from your gun.

1328
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,877
Blink if you're calm.

1329
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,354
He blink?

1330
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,800
He blinked.

1331
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,118
Blink if you're gonna remain calm.

1332
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,473
He blinked.

1333
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,398
Take his pistol.

1334
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,991
I'm real sorry about this, son.

1335
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,832
Like I said 

1336
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,270
nothing personal, just 

1337
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,596
a precaution.

1338
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,711
Pretty sneaky.

1339
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,040
Afraid the same applies to you, too 

1340
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,595
Mr...Mobray.

1341
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,677
Ah, precautions must be taken

1342
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,077
because life is too sweet to lose.

1343
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,790
Hand me that little bucket.

1344
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,920
O.B.

1345
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,396
Go to the outhouse.

1346
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,150
Take this bucket and dump it down the shithole.

1347
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,630
Why do I got to go outside?

1348
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,399
Well, your jacket's already on 

1349
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,513
and I sorta kinda trust you.

1350
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,034
Grab the other cup.
Yeah, I got it.

1351
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,271
After you, Major.

1352
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,559
Okay.

1353
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,552
I'm gonna cut you loose while we eat.

1354
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,071
Don't get any ideas.
I ain't goin' soft on ya.

1355
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,999
Lift your ass even one inch off that seat 

1356
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,750
and I'll put a bullet right
in your goddamn throat.

1357
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,111
Come here.

1358
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,073
Oh!

1359
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,550
So, Domergue 

1360
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,798
I suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck

1361
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,912
far as you're concerned.

1362
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,037
You don't hear me complainin', do ya?

1363
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,277
No, I sure don't.

1364
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,714
Well, how 'bout you, Oswaldo?

1365
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,038
How 'bout me what?

1366
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,560
Look 

1367
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,751
considering all the things
I done for money 

1368
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,758
I ain't one to judge, but 

1369
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,111
don't you feel just the least little bad

1370
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,630
about hangin' a woman?

1371
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,559
Well, until they invent a
trigger a woman can't pull 

1372
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,878
if you're a hangman you're going to hang women.

1373
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,480
Well, hell, Ozzie, I guess

1374
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,751
I ain't never looked at it like that before.

1375
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,315
When it comes to some of them
mean bastards out there 

1376
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,272
it's the only thing does the job.

1377
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,279
You really only need
to hang mean bastards.

1378
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,359
But mean bastards, you need to hang.

1379
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,600
You goddamn son of a bitch!

1380
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,911
I almost died out there!

1381
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,830
I ain't ever...going out in that shit

1382
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,078
ever, ever again!

1383
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,872
You okay, O.B.?

1384
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,400
I'm fine.

1385
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,318
I'll be fine.

1386
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,478
I just need to get warm.

1387
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,991
You want some stew, O.B.?

1388
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,634
Stew?

1389
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,229
Later.

1390
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,752
Oh, yeah.

1391
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,837
That's nice.

1392
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,353
So 

1393
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,477
how you doing, Black Major?

1394
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,557
I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.

1395
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,911
Leave me be from your horseshit.

1396
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,472
John Ruth says you got a Lincoln letter.

1397
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,513
I told you, jackass, go hee-haw someplace else.

1398
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,233
That's right, John.

1399
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,272
You did say that, didn't you?

1400
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,392
Yeah, I did.

1401
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,320
So 

1402
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,035
you got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

1403
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,674
Yes.

1404
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,514
The...Abraham Lincoln?

1405
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,869
Yes.

1406
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,354
Abraham Lincoln?

1407
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,278
The President of the United States?

1408
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,198
Yes.

1409
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,197
OfAmerica?

1410
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,356
Yes.

1411
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,716
Wrote you a letter 

1412
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,115
personally?

1413
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,515
Yes.

1414
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,757
Personally, as in 'Dear Major Warren'?

1415
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,076
No, personally, as in 'Dear Marquis.

1416
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,350
Dear Marquis'?

1417
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,800
Abraham Lincoln 

1418
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,680
the President of the United States ofAmerica?

1419
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,836
Yes.

1420
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,838
May I see it?

1421
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,599
No, you may not.

1422
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,592
But the way John tells it 

1423
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,439
you weren't just some random nigger soldier

1424
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,597
picked from a pile of letters.

1425
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,838
Way John tells it 

1426
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,872
y'all had a correspondence.

1427
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,229
Yes.

1428
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,397
The way John tells it 

1429
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,070
y'all was practically pen pals.

1430
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,510
Yes.

1431
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,553
And a pen pal's 

1432
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,070
practically a friend.

1433
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,356
John Ruth 

1434
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,392
you really think a nigger 

1435
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,752
drummed out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down his back 

1436
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,434
was practically friends

1437
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,995
with the President of the United States ofAmerica?

1438
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,600
John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it to you 

1439
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,480
but ain't nobody in Minnie's
Haberdashery ever corresponded

1440
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,677
with Abraham Lincoln.

1441
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,439
Least of all 

1442
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,512
that nigger there!

1443
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,236
Was all that horseshit?

1444
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,110
Course it was.

1445
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,680
Good one, Warren!

1446
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,593
Talk that sass, nigger!

1447
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,116
Talk that sass!

1448
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,430
Well, I guess it's true what
they say about you people.

1449
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,677
Can't trust a fuckin' word
comes out of your mouth.

1450
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,350
What's the matter, John Ruth?

1451
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,153
I hurt your feelings?

1452
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,590
As a matter of fact 

1453
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,518
you did.

1454
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,393
I...I know 

1455
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,274
I'm the only black son of a
bitch you ever conversed with 

1456
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,357
so I'm gonna cut you some slack.

1457
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,234
But you got no idea what it's like

1458
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,194
being a black man facin' down America.

1459
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,676
Only time black folks is safe

1460
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,076
is when white folks is disarmed.

1461
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,194
And this letter had the desired effect

1462
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,233
of disarmin' white folks.

1463
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,554
Call it what you want.

1464
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,673
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.

1465
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,429
You want to know why I lie

1466
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,995
about somethin' like that, white man?

1467
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,517
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it?

1468
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,916
Well, I'll tell you like
the good Lord told John.

1469
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,430
A letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have had

1470
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,472
that kind of effect on me.

1471
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,512
I might let a whore piss on it.

1472
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,997
I spit on it.
Good for you, sister!

1473
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,314
Warren.

1474
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,955
Goddamn it, you leave that old man alone.

1475
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,037
Stand down, you son of a bitch.

1476
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,755
I shared a battlefield with this man.

1477
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,112
Or would you deny me that, too?

1478
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:58,312
I suppose you were there.

1479
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,159
May I join you?

1480
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,071
Yes, you may.

1481
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,913
Damn it.

1482
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,751
So, how's life since the war?

1483
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,838
Got both my legs.

1484
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,271
Both my arms.

1485
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,557
I can't complain.

1486
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,196
Got a woman?

1487
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,789
Fever took her start of this last winter.

1488
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,320
Mm.

1489
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,159
What was her name?

1490
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,636
Betsy.

1491
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,150
Georgia gal?

1492
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,192
Augusta.

1493
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,271
Atlanta boy, Augusta girl.

1494
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,199
I used to raise Kentucky horses.

1495
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,880
And her pa was the owner of the breedership

1496
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,071
where I bought most of my ponies.

1497
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,994
Goddamn it.

1498
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,998
I made a good deal on her.

1499
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,396
Took the stake he gave me

1500
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,910
and bought a bunch of peach orchards.

1501
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,111
Set myself up pretty well.

1502
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,112
Did a hell of a lot better

1503
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,398
than either one of my no-good
brothers, that's for damn sure.

1504
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,398
Hmm.

1505
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,876
Yeah, your boy come up
here a few years back.

1506
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,711
He spoke highly of his mama, too.

1507
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,440
You knew my boy?

1508
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:26,234
Did I know him?

1509
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,874
Yep.

1510
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,238
Yeah, I knew him.

1511
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,829
You did not know my boy.

1512
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,913
Suit yourself.

1513
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,112
Did you know my son?

1514
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,631
I know the day he died.

1515
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,514
Do you?
No.

1516
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,677
Do you want to know what day that was?

1517
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,234
Yes.

1518
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,392
The day 

1519
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,512
he met me.

1520
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,238
He come up here

1521
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,556
to do a little
nigger head-huntin.

1522
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,275
By then, the reward was, oh 

1523
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,035
$5,000 and braggin' rights.

1524
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,038
But to battle-hard rebs 

1525
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,720
$5,000 just to cut off a nigger's head?

1526
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,075
That's good money.

1527
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,352
So them Johnnies climbed this mountain 

1528
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,949
lookin' for fortune.

1529
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:46,199
There wasn't no fortune to be found.

1530
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,391
All they found 

1531
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,318
was me.

1532
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,999
All them crackers come up
here sang a different tune

1533
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,431
when they found theyself at
the mercy of a nigger's gun.

1534
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,194
Let's just forget it.

1535
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,518
I'll go my way, you go your'n.

1536
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,632
That's your boy Chester talkin.

1537
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,320
You're a goddamn lie!

1538
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,432
If you just let me go home

1539
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,711
to my family, I...I swear 

1540
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,550
I'll never set foot in Wyoming again.

1541
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,597
That's what they all said.

1542
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,236
Beggin' for his life 

1543
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,317
your boy told me

1544
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:35,195
his whole life story.

1545
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,280
And you 

1546
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,835
was in that story, General.

1547
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,954
And when I knew me I had

1548
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,639
the son 

1549
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:50,390
of the Bloody Nigger Killer of Baton Rouge 

1550
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,957
I knew me I was gonna have some fun.

1551
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,959
You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!

1552
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,998
General Smithers, don't you listen to him.

1553
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,152
He didn't know your boy.

1554
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,079
He just heard tell why you're here, is all.

1555
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:07,432
It was cold the day I killed your boy.

1556
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,279
And I don't mean

1557
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,790
snowy-mountain-Wyoming cold, uh-uh.

1558
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,435
It was colder than that.

1559
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,632
And on that cold day, with your boy

1560
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,390
at the business end of my gun barrel 

1561
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,075
I made him strip 

1562
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:27,193
right down to his bare ass.

1563
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,877
Then I told him to start walkin.

1564
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,634
I walked his naked ass
for two hours

1565
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,229
Fore the cold collapsed him.

1566
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,119
You never even knew my boy?

1567
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,550
No, he didn't!

1568
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,909
He's just a sneaky nigger

1569
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,713
trying to get you to go for that gun.

1570
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,153
Then he commenced to beggin' again.

1571
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:23,910
But this time he wasn't beggin' to go home.

1572
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:27,471
Ah, he knew he'd never see his home again.

1573
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,831
He wasn't beggin' for his life, neither 

1574
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,550
cause he knew that was long gone.

1575
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,878
All he wanted 

1576
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,151
was a blanket.

1577
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:42,671
Now, don't judge your boy too harshly, General.

1578
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,111
You ain't never been cold
as your boy was that day.

1579
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,590
You'd be surprised

1580
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,872
what a man that cold

1581
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,674
would do for a blanket.

1582
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,759
You want to know what your boy did?

1583
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:05,512
I pulled my big black pecker

1584
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,996
out of my pants 

1585
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,589
and I made him crawl through the snow

1586
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,554
on all fours over to it.

1587
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,835
Then I grabbed me a handful

1588
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,314
of that black hair

1589
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,911
at the back of his head 

1590
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,432
and I stuck my big black johnson

1591
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:37,713
right down his goddamn throat.

1592
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,436
And it was full of blood so it was warm.

1593
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,554
Oh, you bet your sweet ass it was warm.

1594
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:49,754
And Chester Charles Smithers

1595
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:53,556
sucked on that warm black dingus

1596
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,990
for long as he could!

1597
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,551
You're startin' to see pictures, ain't ya?

1598
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,558
Your boy 

1599
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,956
black dude's dingus in his mouth 

1600
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,471
him sh-sh-shakin', him cryin' 

1601
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,159
me laughin' 

1602
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,472
and him not understandin.

1603
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,599
But you understand don't you, Sandy?

1604
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:34,509
I never did give your boy that blanket 

1605
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,235
even after all he did 

1606
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,957
and he did everything I asked.

1607
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,711
No blanket.

1608
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,277
That blanket was just a heart-breakin' liar's promise.

1609
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,999
Kind of like those uniforms

1610
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:54,157
the Union issued those colored troops

1611
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:58,069
that you chose not to acknowledge.

1612
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,679
So what you gonna do old man? Hmm?

1613
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,316
You gonna spend the next two, three days

1614
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,638
ignorin' the nigger that killed your boy?

1615
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,390
Ignorin' how I made him suffer?

1616
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,230
Ignoring how I made him 

1617
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:26,432
lick...all over my johnson?

1618
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:33,154
Oh, the dumbest thing your boy ever did

1619
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,193
was to let me know 

1620
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,755
he was your boy.

1621
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,837
About 15 minutes has past

1622
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,839
since we last left our characters.

1623
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:27,874
Joe Gage volunteered to take
Smither's dead body outside.

1624
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,118
Straws were drawn to see who'd help him.

1625
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,630
O.B. lost.

1626
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,320
Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo
had a vigorous debate

1627
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,397
about the legality of the self-defense murder

1628
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,113
that just transpired.

1629
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,675
Major Marquis Warren who was supremely confident

1630
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,116
about the legality of what just transpired 

1631
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,880
ignored them sat at the table by himself

1632
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,117
and drank brandy.

1633
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,555
Captain Chris Mannix donned
the dead general's coat

1634
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,354
and joined Oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.

1635
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,352
Hey, Ozzie!

1636
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,557
Now, you got the right idea.

1637
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,637
Let's light this place up.

1638
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,877
John Ruth held the door closed 

1639
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,356
waiting for Joe Gage and O.B. to return.

1640
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,079
Bob enjoyed a Manzana Roja.

1641
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,553
Domergue, however hasn't moved from her spot

1642
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:28,400
at the community dinner table
since John Ruth uncuffed her.

1643
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,796
John Ruth.

1644
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,310
Yeah.

1645
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,830
Can I play that guitar over there?

1646
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,350
Let's go back a bit.

1647
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:41,911
Your boy, black dude's dingus in his mouth.

1648
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,191
15 minutes ago, Major Warren

1649
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,750
shot General Smithers in front of everybody.

1650
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,395
But about 40 seconds before that 

1651
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,477
something equally as important happened 

1652
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,717
but not everybody saw it.

1653
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,196
While Major Warren was captivating the crowd

1654
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,677
with tales of black dicks in white mouths 

1655
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,598
somebody 

1656
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,313
poisoned the coffee.

1657
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:07,320
He did everything I asked.

1658
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,272
No blanket.

1659
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,472
And the only one to see him do it 

1660
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,836
was Domergue.

1661
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:27,033
That's why this chapter is called

1662
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,117
Domergue's Got a Secret.

1663
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,160
John Ruth.

1664
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,999
Yeah.

1665
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,959
Can I play that guitar over there?

1666
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,873
Yeah.

1667
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,552
You come back with anything else but a guitar 

1668
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:59,030
my pistol plays a tune.

1669
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,800
Domergue's Death March.

1670
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,240
You got it?

1671
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,113
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

1672
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:58,711
* Listen for a moment, lads *

1673
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:02,436
* And hear me tell my tale *

1674
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,076
* O'er the sea from England shore *

1675
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:09,989
* I was condemned to sail *

1676
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:13,397
* Jury found me guilty, sir *

1677
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,797
* And said the judge, said he *

1678
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,758
* For life, Jim Jones *

1679
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:26,194
* I sentence you across the stormy sea *

1680
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:31,440
* Have no chance of mischief there *

1681
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,917
* Remember what I say *

1682
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,112
* They'll flog the poaching out of you *

1683
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:41,637
* Out there in Botany Bay *

1684
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,673
* Waves were high upon the sea *

1685
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,316
* The winds approaching gales *

1686
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:53,118
* I'd rather drowned in misery *

1687
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:57,029
* Than come
to New South Wales *

1688
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:01,354
* The waves were high upon the sea *

1689
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:04,279
* When the pirates came along *

1690
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:07,916
* But the soldiers on our convict ship *

1691
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,590
* Were full 500 strong *

1692
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:14,997
* They opened fire and somehow drove *

1693
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:19,876
* That pirate ship away *

1694
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,913
* I'd rather join that pirate ship *

1695
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,670
* Than gone to Botany Bay *

1696
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,318
* And one dark night *

1697
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:34,753
* When everything is quiet in the town *

1698
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:39,160
* I'll kill you bastards one and all *

1699
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,239
* I'll gun the floggers down *

1700
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,797
* Give them all a little shock *

1701
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,233
* Remember what I say *

1702
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:53,478
* Yet regret they sent Jim Jones *

1703
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,434
* In chains to Botany Bay. *

1704
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:07,077
That's the one you like to
sing in the stagecoach, huh?

1705
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,270
Yeah.

1706
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,357
It's kinda pretty.

1707
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,278
Got another verse to it?

1708
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,312
Yeah, lots.

1709
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,840
Well, go ahead, sing it.

1710
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,711
Whatever you say, John.

1711
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,952
* Now day and night the irons clang *

1712
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,790
* And like poor galley slaves *

1713
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,958
* We toil and toil and when we die *

1714
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:42,676
* Must fill dishonored graves *

1715
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,554
* By and by I'll break my chains *

1716
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:50,596
* And to the bush I'll go *

1717
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:55,670
* And you'll be dead behind me, John *

1718
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,476
* When I get to Mexico. *

1719
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,869
Give me that guitar.

1720
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:12,675
Music time's over!

1721
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:13,995
Wha...Hey!

1722
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:15,520
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

1723
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,869
Whoa!

1724
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,957
Turn around!

1725
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,800
John, no!

1726
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,434
No, no, no, no, no!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1727
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,870
Shut up!

1728
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:18,836
When you get to hell, John 

1729
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,917
tell 'em Daisy sent ya.

1730
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,717
Mannix, the coffee!

1731
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:33,072
Oh, my God!

1732
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,715
Oh! Aah!

1733
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,354
Give me that fucking gun.

1734
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:41,791
Don't test me, bitch.

1735
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,514
Everybody!

1736
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,199
Get your backsides up

1737
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,192
against that back wall over yonder.

1738
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:52,829
Well, goddamn it!

1739
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,838
Get or don't get, Joe Gage.

1740
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,360
It's up to you.

1741
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,631
I'm gettin.
Then get!

1742
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,957
You, too, Senor Bob.

1743
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,434
Everybody turn around

1744
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,557
and put your hands on that wall.

1745
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:27,711
Move them damn snowshoes!

1746
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:50,752
Everybody keep your mouths shut.

1747
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,479
Do like I say.

1748
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,353
You open your mouth 

1749
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,472
you gonna get a bullet.

1750
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,829
Move a little sudden 

1751
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,314
a little strange 

1752
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,671
you gonna get a bullet.

1753
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:04,031
Not a warnin', not a question.

1754
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,879
A bullet.

1755
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,310
You got that?

1756
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,880
Let me hear you say 'I got it!'

1757
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,275
I got it.
I got it.

1758
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,510
I got it.

1759
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,313
We have it.

1760
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,792
Chris Mannix come over here on this side.

1761
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,794
Come on.

1762
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,037
Take this gun out my holster.

1763
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,832
Point it at them.

1764
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,152
Now, like I said 

1765
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,034
anybody does anything 

1766
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,470
and I mean anything 

1767
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,273
you kill 'em.

1768
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,833
So 

1769
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,838
you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth

1770
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,997
about bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?

1771
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,831
I don't know about all that.

1772
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:07,429
But I know you ain't the killer
poisoned that coffee 

1773
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:10,075
cause you almost drunk it
your own damn self.

1774
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,759
One of them is.

1775
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,150
Aah!

1776
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:20,272
Ow!

1777
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,199
Give me the key.
Give me the key!

1778
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,949
You motherfucking black bastard!

1779
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,231
You're gonna die on this mountain 

1780
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,750
and I'm gonna fucking laugh when you do!

1781
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,199
What'd I say 'bout talkin'?

1782
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,390
Bastard.

1783
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,876
Meant it, didn't I?

1784
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,514
And you need to understand

1785
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:55,916
you just killed the only man here

1786
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:59,158
committed to gettin' you to Red Rock alive.

1787
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,997
Now, one of y'all 

1788
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:10,079
is workin' with her.

1789
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,237
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.

1790
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:15,000
Or all y'all is.

1791
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,518
But only one of you

1792
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:20,994
poisoned the coffee.

1793
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:27,514
Now, what charms this bitch got

1794
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:30,314
make a man brave a blizzard 

1795
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,272
kill in cold blood?

1796
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:36,112
I'm sure I don't know.

1797
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,311
But John Ruth's tryin' to hang your woman.

1798
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,238
So you kill him.

1799
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:47,158
Okay.

1800
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,272
Maybe.

1801
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:52,552
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.

1802
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,034
He damn sure wasn't.

1803
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,640
But he sure enough layin' over there dead

1804
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:56,876
now, though, ain't he?

1805
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,071
He damn sure is you sons of bitches.

1806
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:01,954
Just like any one of us
would've drunk that coffee.

1807
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,197
Like me, goddamn it.

1808
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:07,279
Now, those of y'all with
your hands on the wall

1809
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,595
don't practice in poison

1810
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:10,439
need to think about that.

1811
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,634
Think about how it could've been you

1812
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,514
rollin' around here on this floor.

1813
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:19,075
And how the man standin' next to you

1814
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,680
would be responsible.

1815
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:23,275
And I know who I got my money on.

1816
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:25,756
Oh, that's right, Joe Gage.

1817
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,234
I'm lookin' at you.

1818
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,630
Not so fast, Chris.

1819
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,911
We'll get there.

1820
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:37,033
Let's slow it down.

1821
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:39,595
Let's slow it way down.

1822
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:46,873
Who made the coffee?

1823
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,593
He did.

1824
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,120
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

1825
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:55,278
Yeah, he did didn't he?

1826
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,598
But it's the stew that's got me thinkin.

1827
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,953
Now, how long you said Minnie been gone?

1828
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,639
A week?

1829
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:07,234
Si.

1830
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,959
See 

1831
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,039
my mama used to make stew 

1832
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,072
and it always tasted the same 

1833
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,714
no matter the meat.

1834
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,752
And there was another fellow on the plantation 

1835
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,394
Uncle Charly.

1836
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,034
He made stew, too.

1837
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,833
And like my mama 

1838
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:27,840
I ate his stew from the time
I was a whipper

1839
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,350
till I was a full-grown man.

1840
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,472
No matter the meat 

1841
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:36,434
it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.

1842
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,393
Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew

1843
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,352
in six months so I ain't no expert.

1844
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:45,554
But that damn sure is 

1845
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:48,354
Minnie's stew.

1846
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,836
So if Minnie is on the north side

1847
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,429
visitin' her mama for a week 

1848
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,399
how'd she make the stew this mornin'?

1849
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,074
Hmm.

1850
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,599
And this 

1851
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:07,509
this is Sweet Dave's chair.

1852
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:09,677
When I sat in it earlier 

1853
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,598
I couldn't believe it.

1854
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,235
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chair.

1855
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:16,591
Uh, this may be Minnie's place 

1856
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:19,997
but this is damn sure

1857
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:22,191
Sweet Dave's chair.

1858
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:27,672
And if he went to the north side 

1859
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,671
I'm pretty goddamn sure

1860
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,474
this chair be goin' with him.

1861
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,952
What's in the chair?

1862
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:43,231
Just what I thought.

1863
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:46,359
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

1864
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,119
Hoo!

1865
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,953
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1866
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:56,393
So, are you actually accusing me of murder?

1867
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:02,559
Way I see it, Senor Bob 

1868
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:05,832
is whoever is workin' with her

1869
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,794
ain't who they say they is.

1870
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,752
And if it's you 

1871
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,997
that means Minnie and her man

1872
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,952
ain't at her mama's.

1873
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:18,551
They layin' out back there dead somewhere.

1874
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:20,717
Or if it's you little British man 

1875
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:24,038
the real Oswaldo Mobray layin'
in a ditch somewhere

1876
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:26,675
and you just a English fella
passin' off his papers.

1877
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,554
Or we go by my theory 

1878
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:32,593
which is the ugliest guy
did it.

1879
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:35,280
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

1880
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:39,679
So I take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned

1881
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,757
while you were murdering the old man?

1882
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,599
Yes.

1883
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:47,235
Well, mi negro amigo 

1884
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,511
during that whole incident 

1885
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:52,235
I was sitting on that side of the room

1886
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:54,556
playing 'Silent Night' on the piano.

1887
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:57,713
Oh, I ain't say you poisoned the coffee.

1888
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:00,799
I said you didn't make the stew.

1889
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,791
My theory is 

1890
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,913
you workin' with the man

1891
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,713
who poisoned the coffee 

1892
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,230
and both of y'all murdered Minnie 

1893
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:16,273
Sweet Dave and whoever else
picked this bad-luck day

1894
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,234
to visit Minnie's Haberdashery this mornin.

1895
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:23,115
And at some point y'all intended

1896
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,709
to bushwhack John Ruth

1897
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,594
and free Daisy.

1898
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:31,155
But you didn't count on the blizzard 

1899
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:34,318
and you didn't count on the two of us.

1900
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,590
Hmm.

1901
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,957
That's far as I got.
How am I doing?

1902
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,315
You're a real imaginative nigger 

1903
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:49,676
ain't you?

1904
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,634
So, do you intend to murder me

1905
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:55,070
based on a far-fetched nigger theory 

1906
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:57,596
or can you prove it, cabron?

1907
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:04,280
It ain't so far-fetched Senor Bob.

1908
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:07,154
And it's a little bit more than a theory.

1909
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,080
How long you say you been workin' for Minnie?

1910
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,953
Four months.

1911
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,799
Mmm.

1912
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:20,594
See, if you'd have been here
two and a half years ago 

1913
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:24,555
you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.

1914
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:27,115
Minnie mention that to you?

1915
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,272
No.

1916
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:33,194
You want to know what that sign said, Senor Bob?

1917
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:39,639
No dogs or Mexicans allowed.

1918
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,594
Now, Minnie hung that sign up

1919
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,712
the day she opened this haberdashery.

1920
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:49,799
And it hung over that bar every day

1921
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:52,919
till she took it down a little over two years ago.

1922
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,273
You know why she took it down?

1923
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:00,675
She started lettin' in dogs.

1924
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:08,320
Now, Minnie liked just about everybody 

1925
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,597
but she sure don't

1926
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,552
like Mexicans.

1927
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:14,592
So when you tell me

1928
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:18,270
Minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama 

1929
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,960
well, I find that highly unlikely.

1930
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:24,357
But okay, maybe.

1931
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,075
But when you tell me

1932
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:30,830
Minnie Mink took the haberdashery 

1933
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,914
the most precious thing
to her in the whole world 

1934
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:39,000
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?

1935
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,119
Well, that's what I meant in the barn

1936
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,960
when I said that sure don't sound like Minnie.

1937
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,033
Now I am calling you a liar 

1938
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:52,117
Senor Bob.

1939
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,392
And if you lyin' 

1940
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,000
which you are 

1941
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:59,680
then you killed Minnie.

1942
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:01,632
And Sweet Dave.

1943
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,470
Four measly bullets 

1944
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:25,718
and there goes Senor Bob.

1945
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:30,671
But that still
don't get us no closer

1946
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:34,157
to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffee, though.

1947
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:35,316
Do it, Chris?

1948
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:37,437
No, it sure don't.

1949
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:45,790
Now, one of y'all poisoned this coffee

1950
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,320
to free Daisy.

1951
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,113
If I don't hear a confession

1952
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:52,358
from one of you motherfuckers
quick, fast and in a hurry 

1953
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:55,040
I'm gonna pour this whole pot of coffee

1954
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,755
down that bitch's Goddamn throat.

1955
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:02,232
Okay! Time's up.

1956
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:03,635
Stop!

1957
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:05,678
All right, I did it.

1958
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:07,712
It was me.
I poisoned the coffee.

1959
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:11,799
I fuckin' knew it!

1960
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,354
Oh!

1961
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,876
You gonna die now you murderin' bastard!

1962
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,038
Major Warren please let me send this ugly

1963
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,038
son of a bitch to hell.

1964
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,958
You killed O.B.

1965
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:24,673
He was worth ten of you.

1966
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,473
Warren, can I kill him?

1967
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,795
Say adios to your huevos.

1968
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:38,074
Major Warren!

1969
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:58,432
I ain't got no gun 

1970
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,995
Sheriff.

1971
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:36,954
Roy!

1972
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:38,673
Good boy.

1973
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,074
Get up!

1974
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,316

02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,038
Whoa! Hey, Charly, my boy.

1996
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:57,236
How the hell are you?

1997
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:58,760
Hiya, Ed.
Hiya, Judy.

1998
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,280

1999
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,520
Ah.

2000
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:03,750
How many you got?

2001
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:04,916
Full house today, friend.

2002
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:06,520
Got one in there waitin.

2003
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:07,994
Well, he's gonna have to keep on waitin.

2004
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:09,120
We ain't got no room.

2005
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:10,560
Well, you need to tell Minnie.

2006
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:11,955
Cause he been here two days 

2007
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,594
and Minnie wants him
out of here.

2008
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,592
Well, I can't give him
a seat I don't have.

2009
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:18,229
Listen, why don't you take
the passengers inside

2010
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:19,714
and introduce 'em to Minnie 

2011
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,194
warm yourself up and drink some coffee.

2012
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:22,390
Yeah.

2013
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:29,399
Here we are, everybody.

2014
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:30,840
Minnie's Haberdashery.

2015
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,110
Step outside you and your friends

2016
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,475
can stretch your legs.

2017
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,920
When you're ready step on inside 

2018
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,236
get warm by the fire get some coffee in you.

2019
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:39,158
I'll introduce you to Minnie.

2020
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:45,034
Hiya, Minnie!

2021
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:04,520
Now, Minnie I'm not tryin' to tell you

2022
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:06,600
how to run your business
but I would think coffee

2023
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:08,911
would be the first thing you'd make.
Hmm.

2024
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,440
Come on in, everybody.
Don't be shy.

2025
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:11,954
Hats!

2026
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:14,436
Everybody, this is Minnie
and this is her place.

2027
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,758
Behind me, pluckin' that chicken, is Gemma.

2028
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:18,916
Ah.

2029
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,396
Lovely smile, that Gemma.

2030
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:23,273
Now, the fella in the uniform I don't know 

2031
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,392
but the one he's playing
chess with is Sweet Dave.

2032
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,670
Hiya, Dave.

2033
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,757
Hey, Judy.

2034
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,434
And, Minnie 

2035
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,994
these are the passengers.

2036
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:33,998
Well, that's not good enough.

2037
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:35,952
Go on, take away them rags 

2038
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:38,311
let's see some faces let's hear some names.

2039
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:41,035
Oswaldo Mobray, madam.

2040
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,435
Joe Gage.

2041
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:44,671
Bob.

2042
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,393
And I'm Jody.

2043
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,155
It's a pleasant surprise to
find such a warm sanctuary

2044
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,476
in the middle of such a cold hell.

2045
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:53,114
Well, make yourself comfortable.

2046
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,515
Get warm by the fire.

2047
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:56,677
Uh, we're just gonna go warm ourselves

2048
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,439
by the stove if that's all right.

2049
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,313
Oh, stove, fireplace, whatever.

2050
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,440
Just get warm.

2051
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:02,789
Oh, and Judy said somethin'

2052
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:04,673
about the best coffee in the world.

2053
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,792
Ah, yes. I do believe Judy did say something

2054
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:09,230
about the best coffee in the world.

2055
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,680
Well, I don't know about all that 

2056
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:12,359
but I tell you what it is.

2057
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:13,994
It's hot, it's strong and it's good.

2058
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:15,315
And in this here snow 

2059
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:17,079
it sure enough warms your ass up.

2060
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,510
You don't need to sell it Minnie,
you need to make it.

2061
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:21,194
And you need to get
your ass out there

2062
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:23,391
and help Charly with them
bags and get Ed in here.

2063
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:25,239
Yes, ma'am.

2064
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:27,352
But fix that coffee.
I'll fix you!

2065
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,479
I don't know, some old man.

2066
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:33,717
Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to do about it.

2067
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,752
I'm just telling you what she said.

2068
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:37,678
Anyway, she sent me out here to help Charly.

2069
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:40,269
She wants to talk to you.

2070
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,039
Charly, you got a hold of these fellas?

2071
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,714
Got 'em, Ed.

2072
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:03,352
Miss Minnie would you roll me a cigarette?

2073
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:04,880
Sure, honey.

2074
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,354
I smoke Red Apple tobacco.

2075
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:07,480
That all right?

2076
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:09,517
That's my favorite.

2077
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:15,274
Don't mind me, gentlemen.

2078
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,875
I'm just watching.

2079
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,674
You play?

2080
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,919
You know, I must have had
at least 12 people

2081
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,396
teach me that goddamn game.

2082
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,877
Just never could keep
the moves in my head.

2083
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:33,959
But if I'm not disturbing 

2084
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,230
I'd like to watch.

2085
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,760
Hell no! I like whippin'

2086
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:38,639
this old man's ass in front of a audience.

2087
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:41,156
You ain't whippin' shit!

2088
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:45,395
Merci beaucoup Mademoiselle Minnie.

2089
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:46,954
Oh, that's real nice.

2090
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,480
What is that?

2091
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:49,790
That's French.

2092
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:51,593
You speak French?

2093
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:53,074
Oui.

2094
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:55,431
Oui'? What does that mean?

2095
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:57,279
It means 'yes.

2096
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,671
Oui, yes.

2097
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:03,271
Hey, hey, Dave ask me if my ass is fat.

2098
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:04,436
What?

2099
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,153
Ask me if my ass is fat.

2100
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:07,555
It is.

2101
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:09,319
I said ask me.

2102
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:10,635
Why?

2103
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:12,513
Just do it!

2104
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:14,472
Is your ass fat?

2105
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:16,034
Oui.

2106
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:18,277
Look at that, y'all I can speak French.

2107
02:06:56,120 --> 02:06:57,998
Are you the, uh 

2108
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:59,520
jelly bean salesman around here?

2109
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,476
How many peppermint sticks
I get for a nickel?

2110
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:05,592
Five.

2111
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:07,717
All right.

2112
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:12,316
Here you go.
Thank you, sugar.

2113
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:14,397
Okay.

2114
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:24,798
Uh, allow me to assist you, madam.

2115
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,799
I'm bringing in your bags

2116
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:49,320
in case anybody wants to change
your clothes before Red Rock.

2117
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:50,914
Oh!

2118
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:02,199
Peppermint stick?

2119
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:08,557
Thanks.

2120
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:14,354
So why do they call you 'Six-Horse Judy' anyway?

2121
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:17,719
Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen

2122
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:20,275
that can drive a six-horse team.

2123
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:21,595
Oh, yeah!

2124
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:25,396
Kind of a stupid question.

2125
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:29,073
Do you mind holding this for me?

2126
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:30,919
Ah!

2127
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:33,760
Rock steady, madam.

2128
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:36,520
Rock steady.

2129
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:40,714
You got a very sweet
little accent.

2130
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,752
Where's that from, England?

2131
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:44,439
I take exception to that.

2132
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:48,589
New Zealand.
Careful, madam. Precarious.

2133
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,279
Is that anywhere near uh, Old Zealand?

2134
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,200
Mmm.

2135
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:14,640
Auckland?

2136
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:16,558
What the fuck's an Auckland?

2137
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:18,239
It's where I'm from.

2138
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:19,919
It's our biggest city.

2139
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:21,520
Coffee!
Mm-hmm.

2140
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:24,114
Coffee's ready.

2141
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:26,038
Well, it's about damn time!

2142
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:29,912
Best coffee on the mountain.

2143
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:32,236
Oh, I don't know about all that.

2144
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:35,637
Stagecoach drivers like it passengers not so much.

2145
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:38,070
Most find it a mite too strong.

2146
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:40,078
Can't be too strong on this mountain.

2147
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:41,440
Thank you.

2148
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:48,074
Well?

2149
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:49,759
What do you think?

2150
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:13,590
Shit, fuck!

2151
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:17,594
Shit!

2152
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:40,709
Yep.

2153
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:53,237
Mmm, si.
He adds something.

2154
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,794
Not much, but something.

2155
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,274
What you think, Pete?

2156
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:04,114
Well, I must admit 

2157
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:07,039
he does make the setup more convincing.

2158
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:09,476
Hmm.

2159
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:10,829
Okay.

2160
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,519
I'll talk to the old man.

2161
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,915
You three collect the bodies

2162
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:15,838
and chuck 'em in that well out there.

2163
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:19,158
And then start unhitchin' the horses

2164
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,160
and gettin' 'em in the barn
and gettin' 'em fed.

2165
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:23,157
Well, hang on!
I mean puttin' the horses away 

2166
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:24,953
that's easy enough 

2167
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:26,992
but draggin' these fat bastards
up and down the mountain 

2168
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,076
that's fuckin' impossible, mate.

2169
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:29,839
Okay.

2170
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:32,316
Well, this is a store so there's gotta be

2171
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:33,954
a wheelbarrow around here somewhere.

2172
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:35,833
Start with the horses 

2173
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:39,840
and as soon as I get through
with this old hickory tree 

2174
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:42,156
I'll come out and help you, okay?

2175
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:51,350
Hey, Pete grab my coat, will ya?

2176
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:10,632
* Now *

2177
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:12,592
* You're all *

2178
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:15,554
* Alone *

2179
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:19,878
* Feelin' *

2180
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,880
* That nobody wants you *

2181
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:29,475
* And you're looking *

2182
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:32,115
* For someone *

2183
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:36,837
* To hold your hand *

2184
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:39,714
* Someone *

2185
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:44,517
* Who understands *

2186
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:49,393
* Now *

2187
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:53,349
* You're by yourself *

2188
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:59,150
* And you're feelin' *

2189
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:02,154
* The world close *

2190
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:04,795
* In on you *

2191
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:08,351
* And you're askin'...*

2192
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,472
Look.

2193
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:12,273
I just started workin' here.

2194
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:14,357
Whatever Minnie did to make y'all mad 

2195
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,472
I had nothin' to do with it.

2196
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:19,159
* Someone...*

2197
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,357
Hmm.

2198
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:32,280
Well, old man.

2199
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,673
If you 

2200
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:37,393
was a cat 

2201
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,319
what just happened here

2202
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:42,671
would count as one of your nine lives.

2203
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,960
Do you realize how close you came

2204
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:49,998
to being tossed on a pile of niggers?

2205
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:51,634
Yes.
Yeah.

2206
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:53,638
And when it comes to that pile of niggers

2207
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,558
that we buildin' out back 

2208
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:57,558
won't take nothin' to make you general of it.

2209
02:13:57,680 --> 02:13:59,831
You believe that?

2210
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:02,191
I expect no less.

2211
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:05,552
Not so fast, old man.

2212
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:07,712
You might have a way out of this yet.

2213
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:14,118
Later today 

2214
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:16,277
dirty 

2215
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:19,000
son of a gun

2216
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:21,316
is gonna come in here 

2217
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,839
and he's gonna have my sister with him.

2218
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:31,510
And he is gonna have her in chains.

2219
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,678
He's taking her to Red Rock to be hung.

2220
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:50,071
Do you know why?

2221
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:52,556
No.

2222
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:57,717
$10,000.

2223
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:02,952
That's why.

2224
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:04,992
Now, when he gets here 

2225
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:09,478
I'm gonna kill that fella
and turn my sister loose.

2226
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:13,480
Now, do you have any reason
why you would want to interfere

2227
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:16,559
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?

2228
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:17,716
No.

2229
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:18,990
You don't?

2230
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:20,270
No, I don't.

2231
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,880
You sure you don't?

2232
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,072
I mean, we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.

2233
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:27,600
Now, you and Sweet Dave looked

2234
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:28,989
mighty chummy over here.

2235
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:30,270
I just met these people!

2236
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,993
I don't give a damn about them!

2237
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:34,351
Or you. Or your sister.

2238
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:37,752
Or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming, for that matter.

2239
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:41,271
That is a good answer 

2240
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:43,875
old man.

2241
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,151
Now, when they get here 

2242
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:49,313
you just sit your ass in this chair 

2243
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,591
and you don't do nothin.

2244
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:52,915
You don't say nothin.

2245
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:54,150
Hello.

2246
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:55,280
Thank you.

2247
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:56,320
Good night.

2248
02:15:56,440 --> 02:15:57,635
That's about it.

2249
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:00,673
Maybe your name.

2250
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:01,916
But that's it.

2251
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:03,520
Hello.

2252
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:04,640
Thank you.

2253
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,598
Good night.

2254
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:09,116
And maybe my name.
Maybe your name.

2255
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:12,278
Mm-hmm, be a, be a old man.

2256
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:13,800
Be dotty.

2257
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:16,071
Go to sleep.

2258
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:18,840
And don't you say nothin' 

2259
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:21,031
and I mean nothin' 

2260
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:23,038
to that bounty hunter
that's got my sister.

2261
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:24,799
Do you understand?

2262
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,115
Yes.

2263
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:31,358
When it's safe, I'll kill him 

2264
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:32,914
free my sister

2265
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:35,430
and leave you be.

2266
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:39,797
Deal?

2267
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:45,433
Deal.

2268
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:47,153
Thank you.

2269
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,153
During the next four hours 

2270
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,397
Jody and the boys chucked
the bodies down the well 

2271
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,832
put away the horses 

2272
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:01,919
tidied up around Minnie's 

2273
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:06,237
stashed weapons
for further use 

2274
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:14,190
and waited for John Ruth and
Daisy's stage to arrive.

2275
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:18,199
All right, boys.

2276
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:19,834
This is it.

2277
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,673
Let's get ready.

2278
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:29,232
Now, remember 

2279
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:31,920
it doesn't matter if we have four men or 40 

2280
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:33,793
we are still gonna be facing John Ruth

2281
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,115
chained to my sister

2282
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:36,799
with a pistol pointed at her belly.

2283
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:38,559
Now, killin' that fella

2284
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:40,797
Fore he kills my sister
ain't gonna be easy 

2285
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:43,674
but you better believe that's
exactly what we gonna do.

2286
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:46,998
So the name of the game here is patience.

2287
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:49,510
Trapped here for two or three days 

2288
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:52,360
at some point he will close his eyes.

2289
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:55,154
And that's when you blow
the top of his head off.

2290
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:57,078
Remember, old man.

2291
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,840
If my sister don't make it
off of this mountain alive 

2292
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,150
neither do you.

2293
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:02,794
I'll do my best.

2294
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:13,797
Whoa, whoa, easy.

2295
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:16,992
Whoa! Whoa!

2296
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:21,000
Good luck, mate.

2297
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:35,597
What the hell is going on?

2298
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:37,837
We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

2299
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:39,599
Yeah, I can see you.
Here.

2300
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:41,080
Already got another one up in here.

2301
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:42,594
No.

2302
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:45,030
Just got through puttin' the horses away!

2303
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:47,550
Well, this ain't the normal line.

2304
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:49,751
But we are stuck on the
wrong side of a blizzard 

2305
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:51,400
so it looks like you're stuck with us.

2306
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:52,600
Now you gotta do another one.

2307
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:55,116
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?

2308
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:56,754
They ain't here!

2309
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:59,873
I'm running the place while they're gone.

2310
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,196
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

2311
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,880
He says they ain't here.

2312
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,276
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.

2313
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:09,159
Who are you?

2314
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,311
I'm Bob.

2315
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:18,912
Well, whoever you are help
O.B. with the horses.

2316
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,879
Get 'em out of this cold 'fore
that blizzard hits us.

2317
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:26,271
Whoa! You all right?

2318
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:27,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2319
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:29,553
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

2320
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:32,514
I just put those other horses away.

2321
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:35,155
You need it done fast you need to help.

2322
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:37,670
I got two of my best men on it.

2323
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:40,953
You heard him, freeloaders.

2324
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,753
Get to work.

2325
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:46,112
All right, you two unhook the leaders.

2326
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:48,994
Come on, let's go!

2327
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,560
Open up!

2328
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:52,239
You have to kick it open!
Ya gotta kick it open!

2329
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:54,073
What?
Kick it open!

2330
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:28,512
How you doin', old boy?

2331
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:31,911
They shot my nuts off.

2332
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:34,953
I'm freezin' burnin' up the same time.

2333
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:37,834
Bleedin' like a stuck pig.

2334
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:40,555
I think I'm gonna die.

2335
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:42,637
And these motherfuckers did it.

2336
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:46,918
That's how I'm doin.

2337
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:48,639
How you doin'?

2338
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:53,032
Well, my leg hurts really bad.

2339
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:56,358
But I think, if I put all
my weight on my right foot 

2340
02:20:56,480 --> 02:20:57,914
I was just bein' sarcastic.

2341
02:20:58,040 --> 02:20:59,918
I don't give a fuck about your leg.

2342
02:21:00,040 --> 02:21:01,235
Huh.

2343
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:03,750
Now, you just 

2344
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:05,951
make yourself comfortable.

2345
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:08,197
Don't worry about my comfort.

2346
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:11,916
Shit, I can't feel my ass no more.

2347
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:14,839
Worry about these owl hoots

2348
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:20,479
and that bushwhackin' nut
shooter in the basement.

2349
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:22,751
All right!

2350
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:27,830
You...fella in the basement!

2351
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:33,479
You either give up by the
time I count to three 

2352
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:36,752
or I shoot Domergue in the head.

2353
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:39,196
One!

2354
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:40,913
Two!

2355
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:44,431
No, no, no, no don't shoot her in the head!

2356
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:45,994
I'm coming up.

2357
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:49,750
Hold on now you bushwhackin' sack shooter!

2358
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:51,394
You just open the door.

2359
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:53,472
We tell you when to come up.

2360
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:00,879
Now throw out your pistol.

2361
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,957
Toward the bed.

2362
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:08,552
Bet he got another.

2363
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:11,320
Now throw out your other pistol.

2364
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:12,954
I ain't got another pistol!

2365
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:15,151
Well, you better shit another
pistol out your ass 

2366
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:16,919
cause if you don't throw one up here

2367
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:20,112
in the next two seconds
we gonna kill this bitch.

2368
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:24,560
See?

2369
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:26,837
Told you.

2370
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:31,557
Now, with your hands
where we can see 'em 

2371
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:36,118
slowly come on up.

2372
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:10,230
How you doing, dummy?

2373
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:15,037
Better now I see your ugly face.

2374
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:23,114
How you like that?!

2375
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:25,033
You bushwhackin' castrator!

2376
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:27,391
What are you doing?!
He was giving up!

2377
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:29,876
It took him too long so I done it for him.

2378
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:37,319
Joe Gage, get your ass over
here and shut this trap door.

2379
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,272
I'm sorry, honey.

2380
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:09,318
May I sit in a chair?

2381
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:12,114
Yes, you may.

2382
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:23,789
Keep your hands flat on that table.

2383
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,877
And don't move 'em.

2384
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,196
Mannix!

2385
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:31,870
You sure picked the wrong time
to turn into a nigger lover.

2386
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,560
Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth

2387
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:35,558
put you smack dab in the middle of danger?

2388
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:36,955
You're about to be murdered

2389
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:38,275
in some nigger named Minnie's house 

2390
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:40,278
and you don't even know why!

2391
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:44,116
Okay...bitch.

2392
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:46,436
I'll bite.

2393
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:47,880
Why?

2394
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,640
I'm working with all three of them fellas.

2395
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:52,720
But not 'cause they got
butterflies in their belly

2396
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:55,594
about me, but because
we're all gang members.

2397
02:24:55,720 --> 02:24:57,996
The Jody Domingre Gang.

2398
02:24:58,120 --> 02:25:01,636
That fella y'all just killed in the basement

2399
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:03,240
was Jody Domingre!

2400
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:05,431
My brother!

2401
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:09,918
Well, who the hell is Jody Domingre?

2402
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:12,157
You want to tell him bounty man?

2403
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:17,440
He was a big bad cat worth $50,000.

2404
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:21,594
And every member of his gang
was worth at least ten.

2405
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:24,633
Which finally explains
why you worth ten.

2406
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:27,070
And what's gonna happen when
that sun comes out, nigger?

2407
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:29,920
So is my brother's 15 men
coming straight here for us.

2408
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:31,918
Tell him, Grouch!

2409
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:34,350
Jody got 15 men waiting in Red Rock.

2410
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,311
We couldn't kill John Ruth
and free Daisy here 

2411
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:43,957
their job was to sack
the town kill John Ruth

2412
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:46,640
and free Daisy there.

2413
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:50,276
Now, with my brother dead
I'm in charge of this gang.

2414
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:51,840
Right, boys?
That's right, Daisy.

2415
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:52,880
Oh, yeah.

2416
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:54,718
And, Chris, I am telling you 

2417
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:59,153
you ain't done anything yet
that we can't forgive.

2418
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:01,112
So, let's make a deal.

2419
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:02,720
No deals, bitch.

2420
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:05,275
You gonna let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?!

2421
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:09,116
Hold it, Warren.

2422
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:12,239
Seeing as how she ain't
got nothing to sell 

2423
02:26:12,360 --> 02:26:16,354
I'm kinda curious about her sales pitch.

2424
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:17,675
Humor me.

2425
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:22,635
All right...bitch.

2426
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:35,956
What's...your...deal?

2427
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:38,072
Easy.

2428
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:42,797
Take your gun shoot that nigger dead.

2429
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:46,755
Then we sit here all nice-like
for the next two days.

2430
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:50,032
When the snow melts, we go to
Mexico, you go on to Red Rock 

2431
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:52,152
get that star pinned on your chest.

2432
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:55,313
Hey, Pete.
How much can we pay him?

2433
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:59,639
Well, we could give him Marco.

2434
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:04,836
Bob's real name is Marco the Mexican.

2435
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,435
He's worth $12,000.

2436
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:09,756
That's Marco the Mexican?

2437
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:11,718
Precisely, yeah.

2438
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:13,519
Shit.

2439
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:17,634
Now that I blowed his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.

2440
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:20,357
Oh!

2441
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:22,039
Oh, sh...Oh, sh 

2442
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,959
Well, then, if I die
in the next two days 

2443
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:27,595
which is more than likely you can have me.

2444
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:30,554
Under the name of English Pete Hicox 

2445
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:34,913
I got a federal bounty
of $15,000 on my head.

2446
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:38,999
It's all yours, Chris.

2447
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:42,119
You keep talking, Pete 

2448
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:45,995
you gonna talk yourself to death.

2449
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:48,999
Joe Gage, who you be?

2450
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:50,600
Grouch Douglass.

2451
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:53,880
You heard of him?

2452
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,310
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.

2453
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:59,877
He worth ten, just like Daisy.

2454
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,071
Well, remind me 

2455
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:07,355
why we wouldn't just
kill all y'all, cash in.

2456
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:10,752
Oh, you can kill us all but
you'll never spend a cent

2457
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,155
of that bounty money 

2458
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:14,676
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.

2459
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:17,110
Cause when that snow melts
the rest of Jody's gang 

2460
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:21,320
all 15 of 'em that are waiting
in Red Rock, are coming here.

2461
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:24,160
Now, l...let's say you shoot us all.

2462
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:27,876
If you really want all that
Domingre Gang bounty money 

2463
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:31,033
you still got to get all
our corpses into Red Rock.

2464
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:33,311
And that ain't gonna be so easy.

2465
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:35,671
Cause I...I doubt you can
drive a four-horse team.

2466
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:38,639
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two-horse team.

2467
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:40,678
So that means you're gonna have to lead

2468
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:43,440
a string of horsesinto Red Rock.

2469
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:45,876
And with that deep snow after a blizzard 

2470
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,276
you ain't gonna be able to get
away with any more than 

2471
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:50,471
say, one body per horse.

2472
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:56,392
So that's you leading a string
of four horses into Red Rock.

2473
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:59,991
And with all them horses in that snow

2474
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:03,113
and you all by your lonesome
you're gonna be a mite poky.

2475
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:05,550
And you're gonna run smack
dab into the Domingre Gang.

2476
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:07,592
And again, Grouch how many is that?

2477
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:09,074
15 killers strong.

2478
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:13,956
And when those 15 killers come across you

2479
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:15,912
in possession of all our dead bodies 

2480
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:18,396
they ain't just gonna
kill you and that nigger!

2481
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:20,432
They gonna go back to Red Rock

2482
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:24,031
and kill every son of a bitch in that town!

2483
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:26,038
You really the sheriff of Red Rock?

2484
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:28,231
You want to save the town?

2485
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:29,919
Then shoot that nigger dead!

2486
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:32,999
Jesus Christ!

2487
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,395
Oh, ho, ho!

2488
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:36,830
You believe in Jesus now huh, bitch?

2489
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:39,475
Well, good 'cause you about to meet him.

2490
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:42,872
Anybody else want to make a deal?
Huh?!

2491
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,639
The deal still stands, Chris.

2492
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:49,677
You ain't done nothing we can't forgive.

2493
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:53,191
It's all still on that nigger.

2494
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:56,438
You shoot him dead take my body 

2495
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:57,880
sit out in the snow

2496
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,070
with Daisy and Grou 

2497
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:00,600
You cunt!

2498
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:46,435
Mannix 

2499
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:50,076
give me my pistol.

2500
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:53,595
Give it here!

2501
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:00,631
Give it here!

2502
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:18,039
So, you were saying 

2503
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:22,313
we sit here all nice and friendly like 

2504
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:24,159
for the next two days.

2505
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:27,239
Then the snow melts you leave here 

2506
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:31,479
meet up with your gang and
hightail it to Mexico.

2507
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:33,711
That's the deal, right?

2508
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,069
Yeah.

2509
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:40,992
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?

2510
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:42,952
Yeah.

2511
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:45,276
But Jody's worth $50,000.
What about his body?

2512
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:49,997
You gonna make a deal

2513
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:56,236
with this diabolical bitch?

2514
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:58,160
I ain't saying I'm gonna make a deal with her.

2515
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:59,200
We just talking.

2516
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:02,478
Calm down!

2517
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:05,354
So what about Jody's body and the $50,000?

2518
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:06,994
You're getting greedy, reb.

2519
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,474
No deal.

2520
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:10,114
We're taking Jody's body back with us.

2521
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:11,310
He got children.

2522
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:19,919
So I kill Warren and we all friends?

2523
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:23,072
Yeah.

2524
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:36,117
No deal, tramp.

2525
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:38,550
Chris!

2526
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:41,354
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life!

2527
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:43,437
When our boys get here
in a couple of days 

2528
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:45,153
they're gonna cut your nuts off!

2529
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:48,796
And there won't be a stick
left in that town unburnt!

2530
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:53,073
Well, I guess I should be
plumb scared right now, huh?

2531
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:57,553
If you had any brains you would be!

2532
02:32:57,680 --> 02:32:59,433
You see 

2533
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:04,592
here's the problem, Daisy.

2534
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:08,555
In order for me to be
scared of your threats 

2535
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:11,559
I got to believe in those
15 extra gang members

2536
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:13,273
waiting it out in Red Rock.

2537
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:17,838
And boy, oh, boy, I sure don't.

2538
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:23,192
What I believe is 

2539
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:29,157
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass or
whatever the fuck his name was 

2540
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:32,557
poisoned the coffee.

2541
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:37,078
And you watched him do it.

2542
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:41,672
And you watched me pour a cup
and you didn't say shit!

2543
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:44,280
And 

2544
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:49,595
I believe you are what you've always been 

2545
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:53,999
a lying bitch who will do anything

2546
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:56,152
to cheat the rope waiting
for her in Red Rock 

2547
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:59,910
including shitting out
15 extra gang members

2548
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:02,675
whenever you need be.

2549
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:05,190
Oh, oh!

2550
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:07,710
And 

2551
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:15,198
I believe, when it comes to what's left

2552
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:20,634
of the Jody Domingre Gang I'm looking at 'em.

2553
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:23,355
Right here, right now 

2554
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:26,513
dead on this motherfucking floor!

2555
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,393
Goddamn right.

2556
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:32,639
Then you're gonna die
on this mountain, Chris.

2557
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:35,992
Cause my brother leads an army of men.

2558
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:38,994
Horseshit!

2559
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:41,994
My daddy led an army.

2560
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:45,636
He led a renegade army
fighting for a lost cause!

2561
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:49,276
My daddy held up to 400 men
together after the war

2562
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:53,758
with nothing but their
respect in his command!

2563
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:56,793
Your brother's just an owl hoot
who led a gang of killers!

2564
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,514
I don't feel so good.

2565
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:04,919
Oh, shit.

2566
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:09,160
Ha!

2567
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:17,437
You still alive, white boy?

2568
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:21,280
Fuck!

2569
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:27,319
Mannix!

2570
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:29,193
Oh! Fuck!

2571
02:35:29,320 --> 02:35:31,198
Hey, boy!

2572
02:35:38,440 --> 02:35:39,715
Get up!

2573
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:47,034
Chris Mannix!

2574
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:50,392
If your ass ain't nailed to the floor,
wake the fuck up!

2575
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:00,597
Wake up, white boy!

2576
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:25,234
I ain't dead yet you black bastard.

2577
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:41,150
Chris Mannix I may have misjudged you.

2578
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:44,239
Now we've come to the part of the story 

2579
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:50,073
where I blow your goddamn head off.

2580
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:52,431
No! No, no, don't shoot her!

2581
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:54,950
Why the hell not?

2582
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:56,958
John Ruth.

2583
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:08,556
Now, John Ruth was one mighty, mighty bastard.

2584
02:37:13,800 --> 02:37:19,637
But the last thing that
bastard did 'fore he died

2585
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:21,558
was save your life.

2586
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:24,878
We gonna die, white boy.

2587
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,719
We ain't got no say in that.

2588
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:33,195
But there is one thing left
we do have a say in.

2589
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:37,155
And that's how we kill this bitch.

2590
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:41,479
And I say shooting's too good for her.

2591
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:47,551
John Ruth could've shot her
anywhere anytime along the way.

2592
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:52,596
But John Ruth was The Hangman.

2593
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:54,677
And when The Hangman catches you 

2594
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:58,350
you don't die by no bullet.

2595
02:37:58,480 --> 02:38:02,679
When The Hangman catches you you hang.

2596
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:05,918
You only need to hang mean bastards...

2597
02:38:06,040 --> 02:38:07,474
Mm-hmm.

2598
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:11,150
...but mean bastards you need to hang.

2599
02:38:34,040 --> 02:38:37,875
As my first and final act

2600
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,118
as the sheriff of Red Rock 

2601
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:44,000
I sentence you, Domergue 

2602
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:47,397
to hang by the neck until death!

2603
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:04,032
Hang on, Daisy.

2604
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:06,231
I want to watch.

2605
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:43,758
Now, that was a nice dance.

2606
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:45,473
Oh!

2607
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:48,718
That sure was pretty.

2608
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:54,200
Shit!

2609
02:40:41,240 --> 02:40:42,754
Hey.

2610
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:47,156
Can I see that Lincoln letter?

2611
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:33,431
Dear Marquis 

2612
02:41:33,560 --> 02:41:36,712
I hope this letter finds you

2613
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:41,153
in good health and stead.

2614
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:43,749
I'm doing fine 

2615
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:48,836
although I wish there were more hours in a day.

2616
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:52,351
There's just so much to do.

2617
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:56,952
Times are changing slowly but surely 

2618
02:41:57,080 --> 02:42:02,075
and it's men like you that
will make a difference.

2619
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:08,470
Your military success is a credit not only to you 

2620
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:11,593
but your race as well.

2621
02:42:11,720 --> 02:42:17,239
I'm very proud every time I hear news of you.

2622
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:21,479
We still have a long way to go 

2623
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:28,120
but hand in hand I know we will get there.

2624
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:33,520
I just want to let you know
you're in my thoughts.

2625
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:38,994
Hopefully, our paths will cross in the future.

2626
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:46,118
Until then I remain your friend.

2627
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:49,199
Ole Mary Todd's calling 

2628
02:42:49,360 --> 02:42:54,958
so I guess it must be time for bed.

2629
02:42:55,080 --> 02:43:00,075
Respectfully, Abraham Lincoln.

2630
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,231
Ole Mary Todd.

2631
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:08,670
That's a nice touch.

2632
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:11,275
Yeah.

2633
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:13,357
Thanks.
