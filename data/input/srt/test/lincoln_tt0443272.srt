1
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,870
Some of us was
in the Second Kansas Colored.

2
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,464
We fought the Rebs at
Jenkins' Ferry last April

3
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,277
just after they killed every Negro soldier

4
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,071
they captured at Poison Springs.

5
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,876
So at Jenkins' Ferry,

6
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,640
we decided warn't takin'
no Reb prisoners.

7
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,378
And we didn't leave a one of 'em alive.

8
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,089
The ones of us that didn't die that day,

9
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,954
we joined up with
the 116th U.S. Colored, sir,

10
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,651
from Camp Nelson, Kentucky.

11
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,657
What's your name, soldier?

12
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,890
Private. Harold Green, sir.

13
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir.

14
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,162
Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry.

15
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,340
We're waiting over there.

16
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,131
We're leaving our horses behind

17
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,800
and shipping outwith the 24th Infantry

18
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,742
for the assault next week on Wilmington.

19
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,247
How long
have you been a soldier?

20
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,409
Two years, sir.

21
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,853
The Second Kansas
Colored Infantry,

22
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,253
they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry.

23
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,852
That's right, sir.

24
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,661
They killed
a thousand Rebel soldiers, sir.

25
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,524
They were very brave.

26
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,126
And making $3 less each month
than white soldiers.

27
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,460
Us Second Kansas boys...

28
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,834
Another $3 subtracted
from our pay for our uniforms.

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,366
That was true, yes sir,
but that's changed.

30
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,635
Equal pay now, but still
no commissioned Negro officers.

31
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,711
I'm aware of that,
Corporal Clark.

32
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,813
Yes, sir.
That's good that you're aware, sir...

33
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,137
Do you think the Wilmington attack...

34
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,774
Now that white people
have accustomed themselves

35
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,614
to seeing Negro men with guns

36
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,846
fighting on their behalf,

37
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,284
and now that they can tolerate

38
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,618
Negro soldiers getting equal pay

39
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,216
maybe in a few years,
they can abide the idea

40
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,625
of Negro lieutenants and captains.

41
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,289
In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel.

42
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,659
In a hundred years, the vote.

43
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,232
What will you do after the war,
Corporal Clark?

44
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,973
Work, sir.

45
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,873
- Hm.
- Perhaps you'll hire me.

46
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,505
Perhaps I will.

47
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,643
But you should know, sir,

48
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,845
that I get sick at the smell of boot black

49
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,819
and I cannot cut hair.

50
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,184
I've yet to find a man could cut mine

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,590
so that it'd make any difference.

52
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,192
IRA: You got springy hair
for a white man.

53
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,524
Yes, I do.

54
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,860
My last barber hanged himself.

55
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,767
And the one before that.

56
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,528
Left me his scissors in his will.

57
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,165
President Lincoln, sir.

58
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,243
Good evening, boys.

59
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,902
We saw you, and...

60
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,842
- We were at...
- We was at Gettysburg.

61
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,574
You boys fight at Gettysburg?

62
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,784
No, didn't fight there,
we just signed up last month.

63
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,083
We saw him two years ago
at the cemetery dedication.

64
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,190
Yeah. We heard you speak...
Goddamn.

65
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,790
Uh, hey, how tall are you, anyway?

66
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,221
Aw, jeez, shut up.

67
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,853
Could you hear what I said?

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,190
No, sir. Not much.

69
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,419
It was...

70
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,963
"Four score and seven years ago,

71
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,896
our fathers brought forth
from this continent

72
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,434
a new nation, conceived in liberty

73
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,729
and dedicated to the proposition

74
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,395
that all men are created equal."

75
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,473
That's good. Thank you.

76
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,370
"Now we are engaged
in a great civil war,

77
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,205
testing whether that nation
or any nation

78
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,608
so conceived and so dedicated,

79
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,872
can long endure."

80
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,184
"We are met on a great
battlefield of that war."

81
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,384
That's good, thank you.

82
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,451
"We come to dedicate

83
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,712
a portion of that field

84
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,379
as a final resting place
for those who here

85
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,753
gave their lives
that that nation might live."

86
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,884
His uncles, they died
on the second day of fighting.

87
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,462
I know the last part. It is, uh...

88
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,461
Company up! Moving out!

89
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,297
You boys best go
and find your company.

90
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,300
- And thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

91
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,405
- God bless you.
- God bless you, too.

92
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,972
God bless you.

93
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,653
"That we here highly resolve
that these dead

94
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,848
shall not have died in vain."

95
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,819
"That this nation, under God,

96
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,359
shall have a new birth of freedom

97
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,329
and that government
of the people, by the people,

98
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,327
for the people

99
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,938
shall not perish from the earth."

100
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,867
It's nighttime.

101
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,805
Ship's moved by some terrible power

102
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,372
at a terrific speed.

103
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,207
And though it's imperceptible
in the darkness,

104
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,371
I have an intuition that
we're headed towards a shore.

105
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,245
No one else seems to be
aboard the vessel.

106
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,818
I'm very keenly aware of my aloneness.

107
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,755
"I could be bounded in a nutshell

108
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,724
and count myself
a king of infinite space

109
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,194
were it not that I have bad dreams."

110
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,490
Hmm.

111
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,447
I reckon it's the speed
that's strange to me.

112
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,094
I'm used to going at a deliberate pace.

113
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,002
I should spare you, Molly.

114
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,235
I shouldn't tell you my dreams.

115
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,005
I don't want to be spared if you aren't.

116
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,009
And you spare me nothing.

117
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,074
Perhaps it's...

118
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,612
It's the assault on Wilmington Port.

119
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,082
You dream about the ship
before a battle, usually.

120
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,386
How's the coconut?

121
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,224
Beyond description.

122
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,128
Almost two years, nothing mends.

123
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,462
Another casualty of the war.

124
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,975
Who wants to listen to a useless woman

125
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,077
grouse about her carriage accident?

126
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,770
- I do.
- Stuff.

127
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,779
You tell me dreams, that's all.

128
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,611
I'm your soothsayer.

129
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,442
That's all I am to you anymore.

130
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,486
I'm not to be trusted

131
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,587
even if it was not a carriage accident.

132
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,457
Even if it was
an attempted assassination.

133
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,756
It was most probably an accident.

134
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,390
It was an assassin
whose intended target was you.

135
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,431
How are the plans coming along
for the big shindy?

136
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,096
I don't want to talk about parties.

137
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,970
You don't care about parties.

138
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,477
Not much, but they're
a necessary hindrance.

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,246
I know.

140
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,849
I know what it's about, the ship.

141
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,362
It's not Wilmington Port.
It's not a military campaign.

142
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,791
It's the amendment to abolish slavery.

143
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,628
Why else would you force me

144
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,932
to invite demented radicals
into my home?

145
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,437
You're going to try to get
the amendment passed

146
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,137
in the House of Representatives

147
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,879
before the term ends?

148
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,209
Before the Inauguration?

149
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,817
Don't spend too much money
on the flubdubs.

150
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,549
No one is loved as much as you.

151
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,824
No one's ever been loved
so much by the people.

152
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,793
You might do anything now.

153
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,364
Don't... Don't waste that power

154
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,524
on an amendment bill
that's sure of defeat.

155
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,630
Did you remember Robert's
coming home for the reception?

156
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,364
Mm?

157
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,675
I knew you'd forget.

158
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,519
That's the ship you're sailing on,

159
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,647
the 13th Amendment.

160
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,821
You needn't tell me I'm right.
I know I am.

161
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,694
- Oh!

162
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,224
Oh, it's late, Mrs. Keckley.

163
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,266
Well, she needs this
for the grand reception.

164
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,163
It's slow work.

165
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,073
Good night.

166
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,914
Did you tell her a dream?

167
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,209
- Papa.
- Mm-hmm.

168
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,603
Papa, I want to see Willie.

169
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,940
Me, too, Taddie, but we can't.

170
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,441
Why not?

171
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,811
Willie's gone.

172
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,182
It's three years now he's gone.

173
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,284
The part assigned to me
is to raise the flag.

174
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,355
Which, if there be no fault
in the machinery, I will do.

175
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,194
And when up

176
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,625
it'll be for the people to keep it up.

177
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,230
That's my speech.

178
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,374
We are coming, Father Abraham ?

179
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,946
Three hundred thousand more ?

180
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,276
From Mississippi's winding stream ?

181
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,611
And from New England's shore ?

182
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,742
We leave our plow and workshops ?

183
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:57,877
Our wives... ??

184
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,047
Even if every Republican
in the House votes yes,

185
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,885
far from guaranteed.
Since when has our party

186
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,225
unanimously supported anything?

187
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,058
But say all our fellow Republicans
vote for it.

188
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,961
We'd still be twenty votes short.

189
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,138
Only twenty?

190
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,295
"Only twenty?"

191
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,634
We can find twenty votes.

192
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,607
Twenty House Democrats
who'll vote to abolish slavery?

193
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:21,803
In my opinion...

194
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,914
To which I always listen.

195
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,913
- Or pretend to.
- With all three of my ears.

196
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,915
We'll win the war soon.

197
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,011
It's inevitable, isn't it?

198
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,355
Well, it ain't won yet.

199
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,193
You'll begin your second term
with semi-divine stature.

200
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,097
Imagine the possibilities
peace will bring.

201
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,189
Why tarnish your invaluable luster

202
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,494
with a battle in the House?

203
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,296
It's a rat's nest in there.

204
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,963
It's the same gang of
talentless hicks and hacks

205
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,371
who rejected the amendment
10 months ago.

206
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,840
We'll lose.

207
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,811
I like our chances now.

208
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,148
Well, consider the obstacles
that we'd face.

209
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,020
The aforementioned two-thirds majority

210
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,781
needed to pass an amendment.

211
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,189
We have a Republican majority,
but barely more than 50%.

212
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,623
Fifty-six.

213
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,666
We need Democratic support.
There's none to be had.

214
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,563
Since the House
last voted on the amendment,

215
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,033
there's been an election.

216
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,501
Sixty-four Democrats

217
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,005
lost their House seats in November.

218
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,570
That's 64 Democrats
looking for work come March.

219
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,733
I know.

220
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,345
They don't need to
worry about re-election.

221
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,874
They can vote however it suits them.

222
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,145
But we can't buy the vote
for the amendment.

223
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,185
- It's too important.

224
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,379
I said nothing of buying anything.

225
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,819
We need twenty votes was all I said.

226
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,357
Start of my second term,
plenty of positions to fill.

227
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,758
Mr. President, may I present

228
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,925
Mr. and Mrs. Jolly
who've come from Missouri...

229
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,058
From Jeff City, President.

230
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,667
Mr. Jolly.

231
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,766
Ma'am.

232
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,668
And this here by the fire
is Secretary of State Seward.

233
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,376
Jeff City?

234
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,214
I heard tell once
of a Jefferson City lawyer

235
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,087
who had a parrot

236
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,719
that'd wake him
each morning, crying out,

237
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,352
"Today is the day the world shall end,

238
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,522
as scripture has foretold."

239
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,390
And, uh, one day

240
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,402
the lawyer shot him,

241
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,570
for the sake of peace and quiet,
I presume.

242
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,402
Thus fulfilling, for the bird at least,

243
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,145
his prophecy.

244
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,623
There's only one toll booth in Jeff City,

245
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,247
to the southwest

246
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,884
and this man
Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla

247
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,156
been in illegal possession
for near two yar

248
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,492
since your man General Schofield

249
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,123
set him up there.

250
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,269
But President Monroe give that toll gate

251
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,632
to my grandpap

252
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,500
and Quincy Adams

253
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,164
give my pap a letter

254
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,003
saying it's our'n for keeps.

255
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,972
Mrs. Jolly got the...

256
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,137
Show Mr. Lincoln
the Quincy Adams letter.

257
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,445
That's unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly.

258
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,938
Just tell me what you want from me.

259
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,186
Mr. Jolly's emphysema
don't care for cigars.

260
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,649
Madame, do you know
about the proposed

261
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,782
13th Amendment of the Constitution?

262
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,759
Yes, sir, everybody knows of it.

263
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,496
The President favors it.

264
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,121
- Do you?
- We do.

265
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,199
You know that it abolishes slavery?

266
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,461
Yes, sir, I know it.

267
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,765
And is that why you favor it?

268
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,140
What I favor is ending the war.

269
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,471
Once we do away with slavery,
the Rebs'll quit fighting

270
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,141
since slavery's what they're fighting for.

271
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,808
Mr. Lincoln, you always says so.

272
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,211
With the amendment, slavery's ended.

273
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,448
And they'll give up.
The war can finish then.

274
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,950
If the war finished first,
before we end slavery...

275
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,462
President Lincoln
says the war won't stop

276
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,532
unless we finish slavery.

277
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,657
But if it did.

278
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,668
The South is exhausted.

279
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,001
If they run out of bullets and men

280
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,170
would you still want your...

281
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,340
Who's your Representative?

282
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,880
Jeff CityThat's Congressman Burton.

283
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,209
"Beanpole" Burton.

284
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,340
I mean, Josiah Burton, yes, sir.

285
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,475
A Republican,

286
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,646
undecided on the question
of the amendment, I believe.

287
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,348
Perhaps you could call on him

288
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,357
and inform him of your enthusiasm.

289
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,749
Yeah.

290
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,385
Madame.

291
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,356
If the Rebels surrendered next week

292
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,232
would you, at the end of this month

293
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,902
want Congressman Burton to vote

294
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,903
for the 13th Amendment?

295
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,677
If that was how it was,
no more war and all

296
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,043
I reckon Mr. Jolly
much prefer not to have

297
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,047
Congress pass the amendment.

298
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,916
Hmm. And, uh

299
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,678
why is that?

300
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,113
Niggers.

301
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,021
If he don't have to
let some Alabama coon

302
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,185
come up to Missouri

303
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,626
steal his chickens and his job,

304
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,560
we'd much prefer that.

305
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,265
The people.

306
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,700
I begin to see why
you're in such a great hurry

307
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,862
to put it through.

308
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,236
Would you let me study this letter, sir,

309
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,307
about the toll booth?

310
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,268
Come back to me in the morning

311
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,903
and we'll consider what the law says.

312
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,974
You be sure to

313
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,247
visit Beanpole.

314
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,387
Tell him that you support
passage of the amendment

315
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,550
as a military necessity.

316
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,553
Thank you.

317
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,764
Oh, Nicolay, when you have a moment.

318
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,427
If procuring votes

319
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,473
with offers of employment
is what you intend

320
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,802
I'll fetch a friend from Albany

321
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,672
who can supply the skulky men

322
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,869
gifted at this kind of shady work

323
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,275
and spare me the indignity

324
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,815
of actually speaking to Democrats.

325
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,442
Spare you the exposure and liability.

326
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,019
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

327
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,847
Pardon me, that's a distress signal

328
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,719
which I am bound,
by solemn oath, to respond to.

329
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,207
Tom Pendel took away
the glass camera plates

330
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,233
of slaves Mr. Gardner sent over

331
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,064
because Tom says Mama says
they're too distressing.

332
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,365
You had nightmares all night long.

333
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,235
I'll have worse nightmares
if you don't let me look

334
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,137
at the plates again.

335
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,672
Perhaps.

336
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,310
You can't afford a single defection

337
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,542
from anyone in the party.

338
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,175
Not even a single Republican
absent when they vote.

339
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,481
You know who you've got to see.

340
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,193
Send over to Blair House.

341
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,596
Ask Preston Blair
can I call on him around 5:00.

342
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,667
God help you.

343
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,698
God alone knows
what he'll ask you to give him.

344
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,171
If the Blairs tell them to,

345
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,675
no Republican will balk
at voting for the amendment.

346
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,345
No conservative Republican
is what you mean.

347
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,745
All Republicans
ought to be conservative.

348
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,209
I founded this party,

349
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,410
in my own goddamn home, to be a

350
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,851
conservative anti-slavery party,

351
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,150
not a hobbyhorse for
goddamn radical abolitionists.

352
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,021
Damp down the dyspepsia, Daddy.

353
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,889
You'll frighten the child.

354
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,927
You need us to keep
the conservative side

355
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,359
of the party in the traces

356
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,761
while you diddle the radicals

357
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,992
and bundle up
with Thaddeus Stevens's gang!

358
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,398
You need our help!

359
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,026
Yes, sir, I do.

360
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,704
Well, what do we get?

361
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,239
Whoa! Blunt!

362
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,540
Your manners, Monty,
must be why Mr. Lincoln

363
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,507
pushed you out of his Cabinet.

364
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,080
- I wasn't pushed!
- Oh, of course you weren't.

365
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,682
He was pushed out to
placate the damn radicals!

366
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:17,083
- I agreed to resign.
- Oh, Daddy, please! Daddy.

367
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,384
Oh. You don't mind, boy, do you?

368
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,557
He spends his days with soldiers.

369
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,628
They taught me a song.

370
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,191
Did they(LAUGHS)

371
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,631
Soldiers know all manner of songs.

372
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,102
How's your brother Bob?

373
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,363
He's at school now, but he's coming

374
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,132
to visit in four days for the shindy.

375
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,366
At school. Ain't that fine?

376
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,232
Good he's not in the Army.

377
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,209
He wants to be,
but Mama said he cannot.

378
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,212
Dangerous life, soldiering.

379
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,216
Your mama is wise
to keep him clean out of that.

380
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,446
Now, your daddy knows that what I want

381
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,385
in return for all the help I can give him

382
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,256
is to go down to Richmond,
like he said I could

383
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,589
as soon as Savannah fell

384
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,119
and talk to Jefferson Davis.

385
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,100
Now give me terms
I can offer to Jefferson Davis

386
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,632
to start negotiating for peace.

387
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,860
He'll talk to me.

388
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,505
Conservative members of your party

389
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,236
want you to listen
to overtures from Richmond.

390
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,336
That above all!

391
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,309
They'll vote for this rash
and dangerous amendment

392
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,784
only if every other possibility
is exhausted.

393
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,913
Our Republicans ain't abolitionists.

394
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,493
We can't tell our people
they can vote yes

395
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,922
on abolishing slavery

396
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,021
unless at the same time we can tell them

397
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,029
that you're seeking a negotiated peace.

398
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,939
Leo, it's 100 miles to Richmond.

399
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,805
Get him drunk so he can sleep.

400
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,279
Yes, ma'am.

401
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,181
Here, Daddy.

402
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,674
Oh.

403
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,954
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir, all right.

404
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,647
Where's my hat?

405
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,349
Leo has your hat.

406
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,786
All right?

407
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,728
Go make peace.

408
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,232
Thunder forth, God of War.

409
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,814
We'll commence our assault
on Wilmington from the sea.

410
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,816
Why is this burnt?

411
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,313
Was the boy playing with it?

412
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,653
It got took by a breeze
several nights back.

413
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,385
This is an official War Department map.

414
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,320
And the entire Cabinet's waiting

415
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,488
to hear what it portends.

416
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,620
A bombardment.

417
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,062
From the largest fleet
the Navy has ever assembled.

418
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,568
Old Neptune, shake thy hoary locks!

419
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,668
Fifty-eight ships are under way,

420
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,071
of every tonnage and firing range.

421
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,471
We'll keep up
a steady barrage.

422
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,313
Our first target is Fort Fisher.

423
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,039
It defends Wilmington Port.

424
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,081
A steady barrage?

425
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,741
A hundred shells a minute.

426
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:04,877
Till they surrender.

427
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,953
- Dear God.

428
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,419
Wilmington's
their last open seaport, therefore...

429
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,155
Wilmington falls, Richmond falls after.

430
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,933
And the war is done.

431
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,363
Hear, hear!

432
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,495
Then why, if I might ask

433
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,833
are we not concentrating

434
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,067
the nation's attention on Wilmington?

435
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,507
Why, instead, are we
reading in the Herald

436
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,574
that the anti-slavery amendment

437
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,682
is being precipitated onto
the House floor for debate?

438
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,872
Because your eagerness,

439
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,610
in what seems an unwarranted intrusion

440
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,277
of the executive into
legislative prerogatives,

441
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,219
is compelling it to what's...

442
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,287
To what's likely to be
its premature demise.

443
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,393
Hear, hear!

444
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,087
You signed
the Emancipation Proclamation.

445
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,196
You've done all that could be done.

446
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,525
The Emancipation Proclamation's

447
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,624
merely a war measure.
After the war, the courts...

448
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,462
When Edward Bates
was Attorney General,

449
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,763
he felt confident enough
to let you sign it!

450
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,894
Different lawyers, different opinions.

451
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,474
It frees slaves
as a military exigent. Not...

452
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,237
I don't recall Edward Bates
being any too certain about

453
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,046
the legality of my proclamation.

454
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,413
Just it wasn't downright criminal.

455
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,251
Somewheres in between.

456
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:14,790
Mm.

457
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,622
Back when I rode
the legal circuit in Illinois,

458
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,060
I defended a woman from Metamora

459
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,927
named Melissa Goings.

460
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,768
Seventy-seven years old.

461
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,563
They said she'd murdered
her husband. He was 83.

462
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,137
He was choking her

463
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,969
and she grabbed ahold
of a stick of firewood

464
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,672
and fractured his skull and he died.

465
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,647
In his will, he wrote,

466
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,115
"I expect she has killed me."

467
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,488
"If I get over it, I will have revenge."

468
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,867
No one was keen to see her convicted,

469
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,198
he was that kind of husband.

470
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,599
I asked the prosecuting attorney

471
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,870
if I might have a short conference
with my client.

472
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,206
She and I went into a room
in the courthouse,

473
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,178
but I alone emerged.

474
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,378
The window in the room
was found to be wide open.

475
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:19,045
It was believed the old lady
may have climbed out of it.

476
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,485
I told the bailiff,

477
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,350
right before I left her in the room

478
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,517
she asked me where she could get

479
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,460
a good drink of water,
and I told her, Tennessee.

480
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,860
Mrs. Goings was seen no more
in Metamora.

481
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,165
Enough justice had been done.

482
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,235
They even forgave
the bondsman her bail.

483
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:41,677
USHER: I'm afraid I don't see...

484
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,211
I decided

485
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,506
that the Constitution
gives me war powers

486
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:49,981
but no one knows just exactly

487
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,077
what those powers are.

488
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,149
Some say they don't exist.

489
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,883
I don't know. I decided

490
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,221
I needed them to exist to uphold my oath

491
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,557
to protect the Constitution.

492
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,525
Which I decided meant I could take

493
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,498
the Rebels' slaves from them

494
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,933
as property confiscated in war.

495
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,664
That might recommend
to suspicion that I agree

496
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,001
with the Rebs that their slaves

497
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,099
are property in the first place.

498
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,437
Of course, I don't. Never have.

499
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,403
I'm glad to see any man free,

500
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,708
and if calling a man property

501
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,078
or war contraband

502
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,415
does the trick,
why I caught at the opportunity.

503
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,050
Now here's where it gets truly slippery.

504
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,189
I use the law allowing for the seizure

505
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,352
of property in a war

506
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,895
knowing it applies only to the property

507
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,625
of governments and citizens
of belligerent nations.

508
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,031
Well, the South ain't a nation.

509
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,795
That's why I can't negotiate with them.

510
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,736
So if, in fact, the Negroes are property,

511
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,103
according to the law,

512
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,108
have I the right to take
the Rebels' property

513
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,042
from them, if I insist they're rebels only

514
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:53,082
and not citizens of a belligerent country?

515
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,817
And slipperier still, I maintain it ain't

516
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,715
our actual Southern states in rebellion

517
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,587
but only the rebels living in those states,

518
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,990
the laws of which states remain in force.

519
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,124
"The laws of which states
remain in force."

520
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,373
That means that since it's
states' laws that determine

521
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,901
whether Negroes can be sold as slaves,

522
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,470
as property,

523
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,304
the federal government
doesn't have a say in that.

524
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,999
At least not yet.

525
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,840
Then Negroes in those states
are slaves,

526
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:23,945
hence property,

527
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,174
hence my war powers
allow me to confiscate them

528
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,511
as such, so I confiscate them.

529
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,778
But if I'm a respecter of states' laws,

530
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,252
how then can I legally free them

531
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,619
with my Proclamation as I done?

532
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,857
Unless I'm canceling states' laws?

533
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,958
I felt the war demanded it.

534
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,598
My oath demanded it.

535
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,329
I felt right with myself,

536
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,703
and I hoped it was legal to do it.

537
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,435
I'm hoping still.

538
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:00,205
Two years ago, I proclaimed
these people emancipated.

539
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,647
"Then, thenceforward and forever free."

540
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,118
Now let's say the courts
decide I had no authority

541
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,784
to do it. They might well decide that.

542
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,957
Say there's no amendment
abolishing slavery,

543
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,496
say it's after the war

544
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,532
and I can no longer use my war powers

545
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,395
to just ignore the courts' decisions

546
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,969
like I sometimes felt I had to do.

547
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,563
Might those people I freed
be ordered back into slavery?

548
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,705
That's why I'd like to get

549
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,814
the 13th Amendment through the House,

550
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,008
on its way to ratification by the states.

551
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,812
Wrap the whole slavery thing up,

552
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,683
forever and aye,
as soon as I'm able. Now!

553
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,222
End of this month.

554
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,018
And I'd like you to stand behind me

555
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,923
like my Cabinet's most always done.

556
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,033
As the preacher said,

557
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,067
"I could write shorter sermons,

558
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:01,073
but once I start, I get too lazy to stop."

559
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,008
It seems to me, sir, you're describing

560
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,017
precisely the sort of dictator

561
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,849
the Democrats
have been howling about.

562
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,852
Dictators
aren't susceptible to law.

563
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,424
Neither is he.
He just said as much.

564
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,220
Ignoring the courts?
Twisting meanings?

565
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,226
What reins him in from... From...

566
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,797
Well, the people do that, I suppose.

567
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,533
I signed the Emancipation Proclamation,

568
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,604
what, a year and a half
before my second election?

569
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,467
I felt I was within my power to do it,

570
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:34,042
however, I also felt that
I might be wrong about that.

571
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,369
I knew the people would tell me.

572
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,104
I gave them a year and a half
to think about it,

573
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,543
and they re-elected me.

574
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,479
And come February the first,

575
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,381
I intend to sign the 13th Amendment!

576
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,993
Well, Mr. Representative Ashley.

577
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,157
Tell us the news from the Hill.

578
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,291
Ah, well, the news...

579
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,405
Why, for instance, is this thus,

580
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,302
and what is the reason
for this thusness?

581
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,000
James, we want you to bring
the anti-slavery amendment

582
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,109
to the floor for debate,

583
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,644
- immediately.
- Excuse me, what?

584
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,479
You are the amendment's manager,
are you not?

585
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,776
I am, of course, but...

586
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,648
Then we're counting
on robust radical support

587
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,412
so tell Mr. Stevens we expect him

588
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,749
to put his back into it.

589
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:20,914
It's not going to be easy, but...

590
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,582
It's impossible.

591
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,422
No. I am sorry, no.

592
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,826
We can't organize anything
immediately in the House.

593
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,427
I have been canvassing the Democrats

594
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,521
since the election,

595
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,100
in case any of them have softened

596
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,863
after they got walloped, but

597
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,699
they have stiffened,
if anything, Mr. Secretary.

598
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:36,931
There aren't nearly enough votes.

599
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,030
We're Whalers, Mr. Ashley.

600
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:45,480
WhalersAs in, uh... Whales?

601
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,948
We've been chasing this whale
for a long time.

602
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,018
And we finally placed a harpoon

603
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,176
in the monster's back.

604
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,289
It's in, James. It's in.

605
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,982
We finish the deed now. We can't wait.

606
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,323
Or with one flop of his tail,
he'll smash the boat

607
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,522
and send us all to eternity.

608
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,962
On the 31st of this month, of this year,

609
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,365
put the amendment up for a vote.

610
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,866
Whalers?

611
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,129
That's what he said.

612
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,869
The man's never been near
a whale ship in his life.

613
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,546
Withdraw radical support.

614
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,144
Force him to abandon this scheme,

615
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,979
whatever he's up to.

616
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,186
He drags his feet
about everything,

617
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,313
Lincoln... Why this urgency?

618
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,417
We got it through the Senate
without difficulty

619
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,719
because we had the numbers.

620
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,351
Come December, you'll have
the same in the House.

621
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,411
The amendment will be
the easy work of 10 minutes.

622
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,973
He's using the threat of the amendment

623
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,055
to frighten the Rebels
into an immediate surrender.

624
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,832
I imagine we'd rejoice to see that.

625
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,902
Will you rejoice
when the Southern states

626
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,665
have rejoined the Union pell-mell,

627
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,708
as Lincoln intends them to,
and one by one,

628
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,278
each refuses to ratify the amendment?

629
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,376
If we pass it, which we won't.

630
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,677
Why are we cooperating with him?

631
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,281
We all know what he's doing
and we all know what he'll do.

632
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,548
We can't offer up abolition's
best legal prayer

633
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,080
to his games and tricks.

634
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,692
He said he'd welcome the South back

635
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:04,981
with all its slaves in chains.

636
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,427
Three years ago he said that,
to calm the border states.

637
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,088
I don't!

638
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,034
You said we all know
what he'll do. I don't know.

639
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,405
You know he isn't to be trusted.

640
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,801
TrustOh.

641
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,531
I'm sorry, I was under
the misapprehension

642
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,303
that your chosen profession was politics.

643
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,776
I never trusted the President,
never trusted anyone,

644
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,608
but hasn't he surprised you?

645
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,876
No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn't.

646
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,384
Nothing surprises you, Asa,

647
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,947
therefore nothing about you
is surprising.

648
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,818
Perhaps that is why your constituents

649
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,586
did not re-elect you to the coming term.

650
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,291
It's late.

651
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,624
I'm old.

652
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,256
I'm going home.

653
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,435
Lincoln, the inveterate dawdler.

654
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,669
Lincoln, the Southerner.

655
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,744
Lincoln, the capitulating compromiser,

656
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,274
our adversary, and

657
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,847
leader of the godforsaken
Republican party.

658
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,147
Our party.

659
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,655
Abraham Lincoln has asked us
to work with him

660
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,250
to accomplish the death
of slavery in America.

661
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,857
Retain, even in opposition

662
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,665
your capacity for astonishment.

663
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,443
The President is never
to be mentioned. Nor I.

664
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,103
You're paid for your discretion.

665
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,141
Hell, you can have that for nothing.

666
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,877
What we need money for
is bribes, to speed things up.

667
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,781
No, nothing strictly illegal.

668
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,547
It's not illegal to bribe Congressmen,

669
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,053
they'd starve otherwise.

670
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,648
I have explained to Mr. Bilbo
and Mr. Latham that

671
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,455
we are offering patronage jobs

672
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,654
to the Dems who vote yes.

673
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,461
- Jobs and nothing more.
- That's correct.

674
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,689
Congressmen come cheap.

675
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,995
Few thousand bucks
will buy you all you need.

676
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,367
The President would be unhappy
to hear you did that.

677
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,871

Will he be unhappy if we lose?

678
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,466
The money I managed to raise
for this endeavor

679
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,205
is only for your fees,
your food and lodging.

680
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,008
Uh-huh.

681
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,314
If that squirrel-infested attic

682
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,713
you've quartered us in is any measure,

683
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,478
you ain't raised much.

684
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:11,679
Shall we get to work?

685
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,816
The House recognizes Fernando Wood,

686
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,364
the honorable Representative
from New York.

687
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,569
Estimable colleagues.

688
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,105
Two bloody years ago this month

689
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,030
His Highness,

690
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,543
King Abraham Africanus the First,

691
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,342
our great usurping Caesar,

692
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,115
violator of habeas corpus
and freedom of the press,

693
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,322
abuser of states' rights...

694
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,254
If Lincoln really were a tyrant, Mr. Wood,

695
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,221
he'd have had your empty head

696
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,951
impaled on a pike!

697
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,821
And the country better for it!

698
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,532
Radical Republican autocrat,

699
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,870
ruling by fiat and martial law,

700
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,233
affixed his name to his heinous and illicit

701
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,434
Emancipation Proclamation

702
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,645
promising it would hasten
the end of the war,

703
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:14,079
which yet rages on and on.

704
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,778
He claimed, as tyrants do

705
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,980
that the war's emergencies

706
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,591
permitted him to turn our army into...

707
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,385
The New York delegation is
looking decidedly uninspired.

708
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,125
...and radical Republicanism's
abolitionist fanaticism!

709
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,499
His Emancipation Proclamation

710
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,499
has obliterated millions of dollars...

711
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,574
Over in Pennsylvania,

712
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,113
who's the sweaty man eating his thumb?

713
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,615
LATHAM: Unknown to me.
Seems jumpy.

714
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,841
Perhaps he'll jump.

715
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,852
But all that was not enough
for this dictator,

716
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,154
who now seeks to insinuate...

717
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,421
Jesus.

718
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,654
When's this son of liberty
sum-a-bitch gonna sit down?

719
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,948
John Ellis is gonna break
his watch if he doesn't stop.

720
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:09,036
We are once again asked, nay

721
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,539
commanded, to consider
a proposed 13th Amendment

722
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,441
which, if passed,
shall set at immediate liberty

723
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,275
four million coloreds while manacling

724
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,679
the limbs of the white race in America.

725
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,443
If it is passed,

726
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,853
but it shall not pass!

727
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:31,626
What's more interesting

728
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,694
is how dismal and disgruntled

729
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,160
Mr. Yeaman appears.

730
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,128
Every member of this House...

731
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,526
He should be cheering right now.

732
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,158
Looks like he ate a bad oyster.

733
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,397
...Party and
the constituents it serves

734
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:43,664
shall oppose...

735
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,137
Point of order,
Mr. Speaker, if you please.

736
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,972
Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor.

737
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,136
And the gentleman from Pennsylvania

738
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,474
is out of order!

739
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,412
When will Mr. Wood conclude
his interminable gabble?

740
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,642
Some of us breathe oxygen

741
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,983
and we find the mephitic
fumes of his oratory

742
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:02,353
a lethal challenge
to our pulmonary capabilities!

743
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,029
We shall oppose this amendment,

744
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,656
and any legislation that
so affronts natural law

745
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,363
insulting to God as to man!

746
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,867
Congress must never declare equal

747
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,201
those whom God created unequal!

748
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,510
Slavery is the only insult to natural law,

749
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,379
you fatuous nincompoop!

750
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,281
Order!

751
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,283
Procedure, Mr. Speaker.

752
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,025
Mr. Wood has the floor.

753
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,457
Instruct us,

754
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,061
oh, Great Commoner.

755
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,563
What is unnatural, in your opinion?

756
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,933
Niggrahs casting ballots?

757
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,592
Niggrah representatives?

758
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,704
Is that natural, Stevens?

759
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,639
Intermarriage?

760
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,931
What violates natural law?

761
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,634
Slavery and you.

762
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,713
Pendleton, you insult God!

763
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,979
You unnatural noise.

764
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,256
Mr. Colfax, please, use your gavel!

765
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,889
- You are out of order!
- Order in the Cabinet!

766
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:12,960
Instruct the Sergeant-at-Arms

767
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,062
to suppress this!

768
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,255
We are in session!

769
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,366
- Please don't encourage this!
(GOAT BLEATS)

770
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,025
Don't encourage this!

771
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,074
You're back! You're back! You're back!

772
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,209
I am. The goat got big.

773
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,777
Help me get one of these to my room.

774
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,745
- She in there?
- She's asleep, probably.

775
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,317
- You need help, sir?
- No, sir.

776
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,417
They went to see Avonia Jones last night

777
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,713
in a play about Israelites.

778
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,549
Could you bring your pa this letter I writ

779
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,883
about my insolvency proceeding?

780
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,050
Deliver your own goddamn petition.

781
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,251
There's a new book. Sam Beckwith

782
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,622
says it's about finches
and finches' beaks,

783
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,728
about how they change.

784
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,386
He's here.

785
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,966
He's here! Mrs. Cuthbert, he's here!

786
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,933
- Robbie.
- Hi, Mom.

787
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,331
- Oh, Robbie.
- Hey.

788
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,630
- Robbie.
- Hey.

789
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,128
Oh.

790
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,007
You're only staying a few days,
Why'd you pack all that?

791
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,737
Well, I don't know how long...

792
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,195
Go tell your father Robert's home.

793
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,074
Mr. Nicolay says Daddy's
secluded with Mr. Blair.

794
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,742
Tell him anyway.

795
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,816
- Did you forget to eat?

796
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,582
- Exactly like him.
- No.

797
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,690
You'll linger a few days extra
after the reception

798
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,352
before you go back to school.

799
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,486
Well, I don't know
if I'm going to go back...

800
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,829
We'll fatten you up
before you return to Boston.

801
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,861
- All right, Mom.
- All right.

802
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,637
Oh, Robbie.

803
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,139
Jefferson Davis is sending
three delegates.

804
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,673
Stephens, Hunter and Campbell.

805
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,110
Vice President of the Confederacy,

806
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,980
the former Secretary of State

807
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,610
and their Assistant Secretary of War.

808
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,853
They're coming in earnest
to propose peace.

809
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,627
I know this is unwelcome news for you.

810
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,528
Now hear me.

811
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,564
I went to Richmond to talk to traitors.

812
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,228
To smile at and plead with traitors

813
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,138
because it'll be spring in two months.

814
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,675
The roads will be passable,

815
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,008
the spring slaughter commences.

816
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,016
Four bloody springs now.

817
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,712
Think of my Frank,

818
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,550
whom you've taken to your heart.

819
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,523
How you'll blame yourself
if the war takes my son

820
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,095
as it's taken multitudes of sons.

821
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,163
Think of all the boys who will die

822
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,201
if you don't make peace.

823
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,201
You must talk with these men.

824
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,669
I intend to, Preston.

825
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,797
In return, I must ask you to support
our push for the amendment...

826
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,500
No, this is not horse trading.

827
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:42,710
Not now!

828
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,243
Bob. I'm sorry.

829
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,204
- Welcome home.
- Thank you, sir.

830
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,409
Looking fit, Robert.
Harvard agrees with you.

831
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,746
- Mr. Blair.
- Fit and rested.

832
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,788
Could you give us a moment,
please, RobertThank you.

833
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,619
I will procure your votes for you,
as I promised.

834
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,861
You have always kept your word to me.

835
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,261
Those Southern men are coming.

836
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,934
I beg you, in the name
of gentle Christ, sir.

837
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,061
I understand.

838
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,868
Talk peace with these men.

839
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,772
I understand, Preston.

840
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,244
LATHAM: We have
one abstention so far.

841
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,440
Jacob Graylor.

842
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,573
He'd like to be
Federal Revenue Assessor

843
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,380
for the 5th District of Pennsylvania.

844
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,651
So the total of Representatives

845
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,883
voting three weeks from today
is reduced to 182,

846
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,891
which means 122 yes votes

847
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,962
to reach the requisite
two-thirds of the House.

848
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,724
Assuming all Republicans
vote for the amendment.

849
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,568
Then despite our abstention,

850
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,229
to reach a two-thirds majority,

851
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,068
we remain twenty yeses short.

852
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,163
For which we're seeking

853
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,800
from among 64 lame duck Democrats.

854
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:53,442
Fully 39 of these we deem
unredeemable no votes.

855
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,810
The kind that hates niggers.

856
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,448
Hates God for makin' niggers.

857
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,587
The Good Lord on high
would despair of their souls.

858
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,753
Thank you for that
pithy explanation, Mr. Bilbo.

859
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,555
We've abandoned these 39 to

860
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,290
the devil that possesses them.

861
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,399
We would...

862
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,226
The remaining lame ducks, on whom
we've been working with a purpose.

863
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,231
Charles Hanson.

864
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,006
Congressman.

865
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,437
My colleagues and I would like
a moment of your time.

866
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,275
I wonder if you've given much thought...

867
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,176
Giles Stuart.

868
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,022
Rather clumsy.

869
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,093
LATHAM: Nelson Merrick.

870
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:55,699
Homer Benson.

871
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,343
My name is Richard Schell.

872
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,852
I wanted you to have a look
at this prospectus here.

873
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:08,883
And lastly,

874
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,953
Clay Hawkins. Of Ohio.

875
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,989
Tax Collector for the Western Reserve.

876
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,622
That pays handsomely.

877
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,496
Don't just reach
for the highest branches,

878
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,399
they sway in every breeze.

879
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,903
Assistant Port Inspector in Morristown

880
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,473
looks like the ticket to me.

881
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,371
Boats, they, they make me sick.

882
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,500
So just stand on the dock.

883
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,404
Let the Assistant Assistant
Port Inspector's stomach

884
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:33,810
go weak.

885
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,714
And, lastly,
Democratic yes vote

886
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,718
number six, Hawkins.

887
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,844
From Ohio.

888
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,014
Six?

889
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,682
Well, thus far.

890
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,852
Plus Graylor's abstention.

891
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,762
- From tiny acorns and so on.
- What did Hawkins get?

892
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,991
Postmaster of the Millersburg
Post Office.

893
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,396
He's selling himself cheap, ain't he?

894
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,730
Well, he wanted Tax Collector
of the Western Reserve.

895
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,978
First term Congressman
who couldn't manage reelection.

896
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,062
I felt it unseemly

897
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,674
and they bargained him down
to Postmaster.

898
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,174
Scatter them over several
rounds of appointments

899
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,710
so no one notices, then burn this ledger,

900
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,837
please, after you're done.

901
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,181
Time for my public opinion bath.

902
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,614
Might as well let them in.

903
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,716
Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis.

904
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,282
Thirteen to go.

905
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,962
One last item.

906
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,226
An absurdity, but

907
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,631
my associates report that
among the Representatives

908
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,294
a fantastical rumor's bruited about,

909
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,239
which I immediately disavowed,

910
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,732
that you'd allowed
bleary old Preston Blair

911
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:35,902
to sojourn to Richmond

912
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,036
to invite Jeff Davis
to send commissioners

913
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,706
up to Washington with a peace plan.

914
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:47,049
I, of course, told them
that you would never.

915
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,954
Not without consulting me, you wouldn't.

916
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,955
Because why on earth would you?

917
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,081
Much obliged.

918
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,179
Why wasn't I consulted?

919
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,758
I'm Secretary of State.

920
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:34,418
And you informally send
a reactionary dotard to...

921
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,263
What will happen, do you imagine,

922
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,890
when these
peace commissioners arrive?

923
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,058
We'll hear them out.

924
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,836
Oh. Splendid.

925
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,501
And next, the Democrats will invite them

926
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,097
up to hearings on the Hill.

927
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,767
And the newspapers...
Oh, the newspapers.

928
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,276
The newspapers will ask,

929
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,175
"Why risk enraging the Confederacy

930
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,269
over the issue of slavery

931
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,714
when they're here to make peace?"

932
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,744
We'll lose every Democrat we've got,

933
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,478
more than likely
conservative Republicans

934
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,115
will join them, and all our work,

935
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,523
all our preparing the ground for the vote

936
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,754
laid waste for naught.

937
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,644
The Blairs promised support
for the amendment

938
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,720
if we listen to these people.

939
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,629
Oh, the Blairs promise, do they?

940
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:12,790
You think they'll keep their promise

941
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:13,924
once we've heard these delegates

942
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,934
and refused them,
which we will have to do,

943
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,561
since their proposal most certainly

944
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,935
will be predicated on

945
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,598
keeping their slaves!

946
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,234
What hope for
any Democratic votes, Willum,

947
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,571
if word gets out that
I've refused a chance

948
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,307
to end the war?

949
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:29,546
You think word won't get out?

950
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,053
In Washington?

951
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,850
It's either the amendment
or this Confederate peace.

952
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,721
You cannot have both.

953
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:41,155
"If you can look into the seeds of time,"

954
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:45,091
"And say which grain will grow
and which will not,"

955
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,292
"Speak then to me."

956
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,959
A disaster. This is a disaster.

957
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,401
Time is a great thickener
of things, Willum.

958
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,269
Yes, I suppose it is.

959
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,798
Actually, I have no idea
what you mean by that.

960
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,809
Get me 13 votes.

961
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:02,113
Them fellas from Richmond
ain't here yet.

962
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,671
ROBERT: You drafted
half the men in Boston.

963
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,606
What do you think
their families think about me?

964
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,610
The only reason they don't
throw things and spit on me

965
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,180
is 'cause you're so popular.

966
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:36,011
I can't concentrate on,
on British Mercantile Law.

967
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,278
I don't care about British Mercantile Law.

968
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,148
I might not even want to be a lawyer.

969
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:47,326
It's a sturdy profession.
And a useful one.

970
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:52,389
Yes, and I want to be useful,
but now, not afterwards.

971
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,229
I ain't wearing them things, Mr. Slade.

972
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,359
They never fit right.

973
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,666
The missus will have you
wear them. Don't think...

974
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,707
You're delaying,
that's your favorite tactic.

975
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,673
- Be useful...
- You won't tell me no,

976
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,608
but the war will be over in
a month, and you know it will.

977
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,340
I've found that prophesying

978
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:10,946
is one of life's
less profitable occupations.

979
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,882
Why do some slaves
cost more than others?

980
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:16,286
Uh, if they're still young and healthy,

981
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:17,915
or if the women can
still conceive, they pay more.

982
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,688
Put them back in the box, you scoundrel.

983
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,029
We'll return them to Mr. Gardner's studio

984
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,623
day after next.

985
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,464
Be careful with them now.

986
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,067
These things should have
stayed on the calf.

987
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:35,541
When you were a slave,
Mr. Slade, did they beat you?

988
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,134
I was born a free man.

989
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:40,077
Nobody beat me
except I beat them right back.

990
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,217
Mr. Lincoln...

991
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:47,254
Mrs. Keckley was a slave.
Ask her if she was beaten.

992
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,119
- Were you...
- Tad.

993
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,714
KECKLEY: I was beaten
with a fire shovel

994
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,088
when I was younger than you.

995
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,992
You should go to Mrs. Lincoln.
She's in Willie's room.

996
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,325
She never goes in there.

997
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,833
The reception line is already
stretching out the door.

998
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,766
See, I'll be the only man
over 15 and under 65

999
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,899
in this whole place not in uniform.

1000
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,443
I'm under 15.

1001
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,133
My head hurts so.

1002
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,333
I prayed for death the night Willie died.

1003
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:42,669
My headaches are how I know
I didn't get my wish.

1004
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,682
How to endure the long afternoon

1005
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,216
and deep into the night.

1006
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,512
I know.

1007
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,781
Trying not to think about him.
How will I manage?

1008
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,721
- Somehow. You will.
- Somehow?

1009
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:57,825
Oh.

1010
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,961
Somehow. Somehow.

1011
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,630
Every party.

1012
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,561
Every...

1013
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:09,966
And now

1014
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,240
four years more in this terrible house,

1015
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,139
reproaching us.

1016
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,840
He was a very sick little boy.

1017
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,348
We should have canceled
that reception, shouldn't we?

1018
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:23,850
We didn't know how sick he was.

1019
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,476
I knew. I knew.

1020
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,920
I saw that night
he was dying.

1021
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:32,424
Three years ago,
the war was going so badly.

1022
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,223
We had to put on a face.

1023
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,831
(VOICE BREAKING)
But I saw Willie was dying.

1024
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,489
Molly...

1025
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,329
 I saw him.

1026
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,271
It's too hard.

1027
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,574
Too hard.

1028
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,047
Oh, gracious saints!

1029
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,636
She's just ten feet yonder.
I'd like to keep my job.

1030
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,327
- How nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1031
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,635
Senator Sumner.
It's been much too long.

1032
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,369
"Oh, who can look
on that celestial face..."

1033
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:24,444
And?

1034
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,047
James Ashley, ma'am.
We've met several times.

1035
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,809
Praise heavens, praise heavens.

1036
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,111
Just when I had abandoned
hope of amusement,

1037
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,480
it's the Chairman of the House Ways

1038
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,485
- and Means Committee.
- Mrs. Lincoln.

1039
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,220
Madame President, if you please.

1040
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,292
(LAUGHS)

1041
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,053
Don't convene another subcommittee

1042
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,254
to investigate me, sir.

1043
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,160
I'm teasing. Smile, Senator Wade.

1044
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:45,129
I believe I am smiling, Mrs. Lincoln.

1045
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,427
As long as your household accounts

1046
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,332
are in order, madam,

1047
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,768
we'll have no need to investigate them.

1048
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,739
You have always taken such a lively,

1049
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,642
even prosecutorial interest
in my household accounts.

1050
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:00,407
Your household accounts have
always been so interesting.

1051
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,505
Yes, thank you. It's true.

1052
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,483
The miracles I have wrought

1053
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,112
out of fertilizer bills and cutlery invoices,

1054
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,781
but I had to.

1055
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,993
Four years ago, when
the President and I arrived,

1056
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,595
this was pure pigsty.

1057
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,630
Tobacco stains on the Turkey carpets.

1058
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,258
Mushrooms, green as the moon,
sprouting from the ceilings.

1059
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,633
And a pauper's pittance
allotted for improvements.

1060
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:26,674
As if your committee joined
with all of Washington

1061
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,275
awaiting in what you anticipated

1062
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,811
would be our comfort in squalor.

1063
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,611
Further proof that my husband and I

1064
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,376
were prairie primitives

1065
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:38,543
unsuited to the position to
which an error of the people,

1066
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,145
a flaw in the Democratic
process had elevated us.

1067
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,158
The past is the past. It's a new year now

1068
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:49,355
and we are all getting along,
or so they tell me.

1069
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,625
I gather we are working together.

1070
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,701
The White House and the other House,

1071
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,063
hatching little plans together.

1072
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:56,192
ROBERT: - Mother.
- What?

1073
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,397
- You're creating a bottleneck.
- Oh.

1074
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,337
Oh, I'm detaining you.

1075
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,908
And more importantly,
the people behind you.

1076
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,307
How the people love my husband.

1077
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:11,908
They flock to see him by
their thousands on public days.

1078
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:15,413
They will never love you
the way they love him.

1079
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,686
How difficult it must be
for you to know that

1080
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,423
and yet how important to remember it.

1081
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,839
Since we have the floor
next in the debate,

1082
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:38,276
I thought I'd suggest you might

1083
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,846
temper your contribution

1084
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,918
so as not to frighten
our conservative friends.

1085
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,077
Ashley insists you're ensuring approval

1086
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,086
by dispensing patronage

1087
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,851
to otherwise undeserving Democrats.

1088
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,790
I can't ensure a single damn thing

1089
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,554
if you scare the whole House silly

1090
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,392
with talk of land appropriations

1091
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,397
and revolutionary tribunals.

1092
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,866
When the war ends, I intend to

1093
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:05,735
push for full equality,
the Negro vote, and much more.

1094
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:08,170
Congress shall mandate the seizure

1095
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,800
of every foot of Rebel land

1096
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,470
and every dollar of their property.

1097
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,339
We'll use their confiscated wealth

1098
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,418
to establish hundreds of thousands

1099
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,009
of free Negro farmers

1100
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,782
and, at their side,
soldiers armed to occupy

1101
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,448
and transform the heritage of traitors.

1102
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,594
We'll build up a land down there

1103
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:29,789
of free men and free women
and free children and freedom.

1104
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:34,661
The nation needs to know
that we have such plans.

1105
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,369
That's the untempered version
of reconstruction.

1106
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,168
It is not...

1107
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:44,801
It's not quite exactly what I intend.

1108
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,549
But we shall oppose one another
in the course of time.

1109
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,710
Now we're working together,
and I'm asking you...

1110
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,048
For patience, I expect.

1111
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:55,884
When the people disagree,
bringing them together

1112
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,515
requires going slow
until they're ready to...

1113
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,685
Shit on the people and what they want

1114
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:01,795
and what they're ready for.

1115
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,057
I don't give a goddamn about the people

1116
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,392
and what they want.

1117
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:05,659
This is the face of someone

1118
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,132
who has fought long and hard

1119
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,327
for the good of the people

1120
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,065
without caring much for any of them.

1121
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,901
And I look a lot worse without my wig.

1122
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,701
The people elected me
to represent them,

1123
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,474
to lead them, and I lead.
You ought to try it.

1124
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:26,346
I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens

1125
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,186
and I have tried to profit
from the example of it, but

1126
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:32,248
if I'd listened to you,

1127
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:33,743
I'd have declared every slave free

1128
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,353
the minute the first shell
struck Fort Sumter.

1129
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,989
And the border states
would have gone over

1130
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,226
to the Confederacy,
the war would have been lost

1131
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,733
and the Union along with it,

1132
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,769
and instead of abolishing slavery

1133
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,566
as we hope to do in two weeks,

1134
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:48,232
we'd be watching,
helpless as infants, as it spread

1135
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,435
from the American South
into South America.

1136
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:53,343
Oh, how you have longed
to say that to me.

1137
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,943
You claim you trust them,

1138
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,382
but you know what the people are.

1139
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,018
You know that the inner compass,

1140
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,591
that should direct the soul
towards justice

1141
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:08,287
has ossified in white men
and women, North and South,

1142
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,193
unto utter uselessness,

1143
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,459
through tolerating the evil of slavery.

1144
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,626
White people cannot bear the thought

1145
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,600
of sharing this country's
infinite abundance

1146
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,262
with Negroes.

1147
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:23,601
A compass, I learned
when I was surveying,

1148
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,440
it'll point you true north
from where you're standing.

1149
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,379
But it's got no advice about

1150
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,078
the swamps and deserts and chasms

1151
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,712
that you'll encounter along the way.

1152
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,222
If in pursuit of your destination,

1153
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,223
you plunge ahead,
heedless of obstacles

1154
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:41,727
and achieve nothing more
than to sink in a swamp,

1155
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,497
what's the use of knowing true north?

1156
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:05,149
Robert's going to plead
with us to let him enlist.

1157
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,817
Make time to talk to Robbie.
You only have time for Tad.

1158
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,360
Tad is young.

1159
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,559
So is Robert. Too young for the Army.

1160
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,668
Plenty of boys younger
than Robert signing up.

1161
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:25,331
Don't take Robbie.

1162
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,803
Don't let me lose my son.

1163
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:31,706
Go away! We're occupied!

1164
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,812
Secretary Stanton has sent over

1165
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,467
to tell you that as of half an hour ago

1166
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,818
the shelling of Wilmington Harbor
has commenced.

1167
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,722
They cannot possibly maintain
under this kind of an assault.

1168
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,331
Terry has got 10,000 men
surrounding the goddamn port.

1169
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,399
Why doesn't he answer...

1170
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,468
Fort Fisher is a mountain
of a building, Edwin.

1171
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,627
It's the largest fort they have, sir.

1172
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,568
Twenty-two big Seacoast guns
on each rampart.

1173
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,934
They've been reinforcing it
for the last two years.

1174
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:01,133
They've taken 17,000 shells
since yesterday!

1175
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,836
I want to hear Fort Fisher is ours

1176
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,139
and Wilmington has fallen.

1177
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,713
Send another damn cable!

1178
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:09,407
The problem's their
commander, Whiting!

1179
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,651
He engineered the fortress himself,

1180
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:12,822
the damn thing's his child.

1181
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,219
He'll defend it till
his every last man is gone.

1182
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,757
"Come on out, you old rat!"

1183
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:23,820
That's
what Ethan Allen called out

1184
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,424
to the commander
of Fort Ticonderoga in 1776.

1185
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,594
"Come on out, you old rat!"

1186
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,932
Of course, there were only

1187
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,439
40 odd Redcoats at Ticonderoga.

1188
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:39,373
There is one Ethan Allen story
that I'm very partial to.

1189
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,949
No, you're going to tell a story.

1190
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:45,017
I don't believe that I can bear

1191
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,108
to listen to another one
of your stories right now.

1192
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:50,621
I need the B&O sideyard
schedules for Alexandria!

1193
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,192
I asked for them this morning!

1194
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:56,855
It was
right after the Revolution,

1195
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,297
right after peace had been concluded.

1196
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:02,369
And Ethan Allen went to London

1197
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,096
to help our new country

1198
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:06,605
conduct its business with the King.

1199
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:10,237
The English sneered
at how rough we are

1200
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,643
and rude and simple-minded,
and on like that,

1201
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:13,747
everywhere he went

1202
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,783
till one day he was invited
to the townhouse

1203
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,817
of a great English lord.

1204
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:24,091
Dinner was served
and beverages imbibed,

1205
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:27,258
time passed, as happens, and

1206
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,956
Mr. Allen found he needed the privy.

1207
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,092
He was grateful to be directed thence.

1208
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:39,898
- Relieved, you might say.

1209
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,638
Now, Mr. Allen discovered

1210
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:46,775
on entering the water closet,

1211
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,440
that the only decoration therein

1212
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,072
was a portrait of George Washington.

1213
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,144
Was a portrait of George Washington.

1214
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,023
Ethan Allen done what he came to do,

1215
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,457
and returned to the drawing room.

1216
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,289
His host and the others
were disappointed

1217
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,423
when he didn't mention
Washington's portrait.

1218
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,127
Finally, His Lordship couldn't
resist and asked Mr. Allen

1219
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,984
had he noticed it,
the picture of Washington.

1220
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,471
He had.

1221
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,201
Well, what did he think of its placement,

1222
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,267
did it seem appropriately
located to Mr. Allen?

1223
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,436
Mr. Allen said it did.

1224
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,207
His host was astounded.

1225
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,338
"Appropriate?" 

1226
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,351
"George Washington's likeness
in a water closet?"

1227
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:28,820
"Yes," said Mr. Allen.
"Where it'll do good service.

1228
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,699
"The whole world knows nothing
will make an Englishman

1229
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,989
shit quicker than the sight
of George Washington."

1230
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,367
I love that story.

1231
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:09,390
Fort Fisher is ours. We've taken the port.

1232
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,021
And Wilmington?

1233
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,226
We've taken the fort,

1234
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,633
but the city of Wilmington
has not surrendered.

1235
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,200
How many casualties?

1236
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:33,520
- Heavy losses.
- And more to come.

1237
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,180
It sours the national mood.
It might suffice...

1238
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:38,156
To whatTo bring this down?

1239
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,727
Not in a fight like this.
This is to the death.

1240
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,386
That's gruesome.

1241
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,198
Are you despairing or merely lazy?

1242
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:48,394
This fight is for
the United States of America.

1243
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,437
Nothing "suffices." A rumorNothing.

1244
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,405
They're not lazy.
They're busily buying votes

1245
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,773
while we hope to be saved
by "the national mood"?

1246
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:07,380
Before this blood is dry, when
Stevens next takes the floor,

1247
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,217
taunt him. You excel at that.

1248
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,383
Get him to proclaim what
we all know he believes

1249
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,084
in his coal-colored heart.

1250
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:15,890
That this vote is meant
to set the black race on high,

1251
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:16,963
to niggerate America...

1252
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,464
George, please, stay on course.

1253
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,428
Bring Stevens to full froth.

1254
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,033
I can ensure that every newspaperman

1255
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,470
from Louisville to San Francisco

1256
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,473
will be here to witness it and print it.

1257
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,710
The floor belongs to
the mellifluent gentleman

1258
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:36,283
from Kentucky, Mr. George Yeaman.

1259
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:44,249
I thank you, Speaker Colfax.

1260
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:55,797
Although I am disgusted by slavery,

1261
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,533
I rise on this sad and solemn day

1262
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:06,339
to announce that
I'm opposed to the amendment.

1263
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,653
We must consider what
will become of colored folk

1264
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,624
if four million are, in one instant, set free.

1265
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,220
They'll be free, George,

1266
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,192
that's what will become of them.

1267
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:24,453
Think how splendid

1268
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,365
if Mr. Yeaman switched.

1269
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,300
Too publicly against us.
He can't change course now.

1270
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:33,499
Not for some miserable
little job, anyways.

1271
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,736
And we will be forced to enfranchise

1272
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:39,142
the men of the colored race.

1273
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,306
It would be inhuman not to.

1274
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:45,678
Now who among us is prepared
to give Negroes the vote?

1275
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,383
And, and,

1276
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,718
what shall follow upon that?

1277
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:53,516
Universal enfranchisement?

1278
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:55,919
Votes for women?

1279
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:04,831
We...

1280
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:08,431
Bless my eyes.

1281
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:11,135
If it isn't the Postmaster
of Millersburg, Ohio.

1282
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:16,240
Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound
to inform us

1283
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,249
of your disgusting betrayal.

1284
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:22,081
Your prostitution.

1285
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:25,556
Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins?

1286
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:27,816
Is your maidenly virtue for sale?

1287
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,194
Is your maidenly virtue for sale?

1288
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,032
HAWKINS: If my neighbors hear

1289
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,294
that I voted yes for nigger freedom

1290
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:35,823
and no to peace, they will kill me.

1291
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:36,960
A deal is a deal.

1292
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,629
You men know better
than to piss your pants

1293
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,206
just 'cause there's talk
about peace talks.

1294
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,207
- Look, I'll find another job!
- My neighbors in Nashville,

1295
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,899
they found out I was loyal to the Union,

1296
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,310
they came after me with gelding knives.

1297
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,936
- I'll find another job.
- You do right, Clay Hawkins.

1298
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:50,380
I want to do right! But I got no courage!

1299
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,111
BILBO: Wait. You wanted...
What was it?

1300
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:54,050
A tax man for the Western Reserve?

1301
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,952
Hell, you can have the whole
state of Ohio if you want...

1302
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:57,557
Oh, crap.

1303
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,657
Eleven votes?

1304
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:03,957
Two days ago, we had twelve.
What happened?

1305
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:05,064
There are defections in the ranks.

1306
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:06,132
It's the goddamn rumors

1307
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:07,233
regarding the Richmond delegation.

1308
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:08,301
- Yes. The peace offer.
- Groundless.

1309
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,995
- And yet the rumors persist.
- They are ruining us.

1310
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,164
Among the few
remaining Representatives

1311
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,831
who seem remotely plausible,

1312
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:17,444
there is a perceptible
increase in resistance.

1313
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,137
Resistance, hell.

1314
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:22,145
Thingamabob Hollister,
Dem from Indiana.

1315
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,979
I approached him,
sumbitch near to murdered me.

1316
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,986
Colorado Territory... What's this one?

1317
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,651
Job description... Taxpayers and...

1318
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,522
Oh, shit! Cracky!

1319
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:45,433
Fuck you, you son of a bitch! Goddamn!

1320
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,173
- Perhaps you pushed too hard.
- I push nobody.

1321
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:56,878
Perhaps we need reinforcements.

1322
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,546
If Jeff Davis wants to cease hostilities,

1323
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:02,121
who do you think is going to
give a genuine solid shit

1324
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:03,281
to free slaves?

1325
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,619
Get back to it.

1326
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,221
And gentlemen, good day.

1327
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,987
We are at an impasse.

1328
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,396
Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors, publicly.

1329
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:13,721
Tell us what you expect of us.

1330
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,730
I expect you to do your work.

1331
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,360
And have sufficient sense and taste

1332
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,973
not to presume to instruct the President.

1333
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,040
Or me.

1334
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,673
Is there a Confederate offer, or not?

1335
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,354
 Gentlemen.

1336
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:47,099
I suggest you work some changes
to your proposal

1337
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,225
before you give it to the President.

1338
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,395
We're eager to be on our way
to Washington.

1339
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,700
Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us this?

1340
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:57,744
It says "securing peace
for our two countries"

1341
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,369
and it goes on like that.

1342
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:02,441
- I don't...
- There is just one country.

1343
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,881
You and I, we're citizens of that country.

1344
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:08,221
I'm fighting to protect it
from armed rebels.

1345
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,050
From you.

1346
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,057
But Mr. Blair, he told us,

1347
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,526
he told President
Jefferson Davis that we...

1348
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:17,120
A private citizen like Preston Blair

1349
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:18,288
can say what he pleases,

1350
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,230
since he has no authority over anything.

1351
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,861
If you want to discuss peace
with President Lincoln,

1352
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,770
consider revisions.

1353
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:29,799
If we're not to discuss

1354
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,378
a truce between warring nations,

1355
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:34,379
what in heaven's name can we discuss?

1356
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,110
Terms of surrender.

1357
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,713
Office United States
Military Telegraph,

1358
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,788
"War Department."

1359
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,290
"For Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States."

1360
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,587
January 20, 1865.

1361
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,426
"I will state confidentially
that I am convinced

1362
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,795
upon conversation
with these commissioners

1363
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,401
that their intentions are good

1364
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:57,767
and their desire sincere
to restore peace and union."

1365
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,303
"I fear now they're going back

1366
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:03,410
without any expression
of interest from anyone

1367
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:07,003
in authority, Mr. Lincoln,
will have a bad influence."

1368
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:11,308
"I will be sorry should
it prove impossible for you

1369
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,976
to have an interview with them."

1370
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,349
"I am awaiting your instructions."

1371
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,420
"U.S. Grant, Lieutenant General,

1372
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:21,085
Commanding Armies, United States."

1373
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,359
After four years of war, and

1374
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:29,159
near 600,000 lives lost,

1375
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,033
he believes we can end this war now.

1376
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,541
My trust in him is marrow deep.

1377
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,651
You could bring the delegates
to Washington.

1378
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,184
In exchange for the South's
immediate surrender,

1379
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:53,225
we could promise them
the amendment's defeat.

1380
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:59,225
They'd agree, don't you think?
We'd end the war. This week.

1381
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,126
Or, if you could manage

1382
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:06,297
without seeming to do it, to, uh...

1383
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,537
The peace delegation
might encounter delays

1384
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,579
as they travel up the James River.

1385
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,047
Particularly with the fighting
around Wilmington.

1386
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,357
Within ten days' time,

1387
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:28,053
we might pass the 13th Amendment.

1388
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,935
Here's a 16-year-old boy,

1389
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,598
they're going to hang him.

1390
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,438
He's with the Fifteenth
Indiana Cavalry near Bulford.

1391
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:20,479
It seems he lamed his horse
to avoid battle.

1392
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:23,883
I don't think even Stanton
would complain

1393
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:24,950
if I pardoned him.

1394
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,395
You think Stanton would complain?

1395
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:29,480
I don't know, sir.
I don't know who you're, uh...

1396
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,989
- What time is it?
- It's 3:40 in the morning.

1397
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,584
Don't let him pardon any more deserters.

1398
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,392
Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too many.

1399
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:39,989
He's generally apoplectic on the subject.

1400
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,658
He oughtn't have done that,
crippled his horse.

1401
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,064
That was cruel, but you don't just hang

1402
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,136
a 16-year-old boy for that...

1403
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:45,419
Ask the horse what he thinks.

1404
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:49,067
...for cruelty. There'd be
no 16-year-old boys left.

1405
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,993
Grant wants me to bring
the secesh delegates

1406
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,598
to Washington.

1407
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,263
So there are secesh delegates?

1408
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:19,268
He was afraid, that's all it was.

1409
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:22,274
I don't care to hang a boy
for being frightened, either.

1410
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,935
What good would it do him?

1411
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,991
War's nearly done, ain't that so?

1412
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,492
What use is one more corpse?

1413
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,362
Any more corpses?

1414
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,379
Do you need company?

1415
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,348
In times like this,
I'm best alone.

1416
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:48,423
"Lieutenant General
Ulysses S. Grant, City Point."

1417
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,025
"I have read your words with interest."

1418
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,098
"I ask that,

1419
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,600
regardless of any action
I take in the matter

1420
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:58,762
of the visit of
the Richmond commissioners

1421
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:01,365
you maintain among your troops

1422
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,239
military preparedness for battle

1423
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,541
as you have done until now."

1424
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,155
"Have Captain Saunders convey
the commissioners to me

1425
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:17,951
here in Washington."

1426
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,416
"A. Lincoln." And the date.

1427
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,924
Yes, sir.

1428
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,831
Shall I transmit, sir?

1429
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,735
You think we choose to be born?

1430
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,243
I don't suppose so.

1431
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:46,415
Are we fitted to the times
we're born into?

1432
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,983
Well, I don't know about myself.

1433
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:52,458
You may be,

1434
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:54,850
sir. Fitted.

1435
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,625
What do you reckon?

1436
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,661
Well, I'm an engineer.

1437
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,207
I reckon there's machinery,

1438
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:12,210
but no one's done the fitting.

1439
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,377
You're an engineer.

1440
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:21,277
You must know Euclid's axioms
and common notions.

1441
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,354
I must have in school, but...

1442
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,680
I never had much of schooling,

1443
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,627
but I read Euclid
in an old book I borrowed.

1444
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:33,056
Little enough ever found its way in here,

1445
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:35,532
but once learnt, it stayed learnt.

1446
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:41,135
Euclid's first common notion is this,

1447
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,140
"Things which are equal
to the same thing

1448
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:47,076
are equal to each other."

1449
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,080
That's a rule of mathematical reasoning.

1450
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,482
It's true because it works.

1451
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:55,680
Has done and always will do.

1452
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:00,493
In his book, mmm,

1453
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,030
Euclid says this is "self-evident."

1454
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:05,998
You seeThere it is,

1455
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:08,728
even in that 2,000-year-old book

1456
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:10,393
of mechanical law.

1457
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:12,436
It is a self-evident truth

1458
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:15,599
that things which are equal
to the same thing

1459
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:17,938
are equal to each other.

1460
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,913
We begin with equality.

1461
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:25,909
That's the origin, isn't it?

1462
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,885
That's balance. That's... That's fairness.

1463
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:35,528
That's justice.

1464
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,298
Just read me back the last sentence

1465
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,633
of the telegram, please.

1466
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,400
"Have Captain Saunders convey
the commissioners to me

1467
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:50,476
here in Washington."

1468
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:53,804
A slight emendation,
if you would, Sam.

1469
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,080
"Have Captain Saunders
convey the gentlemen

1470
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,380
aboard the River Queen

1471
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,918
as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia,

1472
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,384
and there wait until

1473
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:12,497
further advice from me."

1474
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:17,163
"Do not proceed to Washington."

1475
01:19:02,565 --> 01:19:05,045
The World, the Herald,
the Times,

1476
01:19:05,134 --> 01:19:07,045
New York, Chicago,

1477
01:19:07,403 --> 01:19:09,280
the Journal of Commerce,

1478
01:19:09,405 --> 01:19:10,941
even your hometown paper's here.

1479
01:19:11,073 --> 01:19:14,543
Say you believe only in
legal equality for all races,

1480
01:19:14,644 --> 01:19:16,021
not racial equality.

1481
01:19:16,112 --> 01:19:17,750
I beg you, sir.

1482
01:19:18,114 --> 01:19:21,220
Compromise. Or you risk it all.

1483
01:19:42,938 --> 01:19:44,975
I've asked you a question, Mr. Stevens,

1484
01:19:45,107 --> 01:19:46,984
and you must answer me.

1485
01:19:47,743 --> 01:19:50,087
Do you or do you not
hold that the precept

1486
01:19:50,179 --> 01:19:53,626
that "All men are created equal"
is meant literally?

1487
01:19:59,255 --> 01:20:02,065
Is that not the true purpose
of the amendment?

1488
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:05,002
To promote your ultimate
and ardent dream to elevate...

1489
01:20:05,127 --> 01:20:07,505
The true purpose
of the amendment, Mr. Wood,

1490
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:09,405
you perfectly named,

1491
01:20:09,498 --> 01:20:11,637
brainless obstructive object...

1492
01:20:13,035 --> 01:20:16,278
Now you have always insisted,
Mr. Stevens,

1493
01:20:17,139 --> 01:20:20,677
that Negroes are the same
as white men are.

1494
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:24,113
The true purpose of the amendment...

1495
01:20:52,575 --> 01:20:53,986
I don't hold with equality in all things,

1496
01:20:54,076 --> 01:20:56,181
only with equality before the law.
Nothing more.

1497
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,551
That's... That's not so.

1498
01:21:01,217 --> 01:21:04,630
You believe that Negroes are
entirely equal to white men.

1499
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,000
You've said it a thousand times!

1500
01:21:06,021 --> 01:21:08,331
For shame! For shame!

1501
01:21:08,424 --> 01:21:11,234
Stop prevaricating and
answer Representative Wood!

1502
01:21:11,494 --> 01:21:13,531
I don't hold with equality in all things,

1503
01:21:13,629 --> 01:21:14,664
only with equality before the law.

1504
01:21:14,764 --> 01:21:17,643
After the decades of fervent advocacy...

1505
01:21:18,067 --> 01:21:19,705
He's answered your questions!

1506
01:21:19,835 --> 01:21:21,636
This amendment's
not to do with race equality.

1507
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:24,810
I don't hold with equality in all things,

1508
01:21:24,907 --> 01:21:28,514
only with equality before
the law, and nothing more!

1509
01:21:28,611 --> 01:21:30,818
Who'd ever have guessed
that old nightmare

1510
01:21:30,913 --> 01:21:32,722
capable of such control?

1511
01:21:32,848 --> 01:21:34,657
He might make a politician someday.

1512
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,990
I need to go.

1513
01:21:36,085 --> 01:21:37,530
Mrs. Keckley.

1514
01:21:40,356 --> 01:21:43,064
Your frantic attempt to delude us now

1515
01:21:43,192 --> 01:21:44,728
is unworthy of a representative.

1516
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,897
It is, in fact, unworthy of a white man!

1517
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,680
How can I hold that
all men are created equal

1518
01:21:53,769 --> 01:21:56,841
when here before me stands, stinking,

1519
01:21:56,939 --> 01:22:00,512
the moral carcass of
the gentleman from Ohio, proof

1520
01:22:00,609 --> 01:22:03,089
that some men are inferior,

1521
01:22:03,212 --> 01:22:05,715
endowed by their Maker with dim wits,

1522
01:22:05,815 --> 01:22:07,761
impermeable to reason,

1523
01:22:07,883 --> 01:22:10,921
with cold, pallid slime in their veins

1524
01:22:11,053 --> 01:22:13,397
instead of hot, red blood!

1525
01:22:13,489 --> 01:22:17,232
You are more reptile than man, George!

1526
01:22:17,326 --> 01:22:19,636
So low and flat that the foot of man

1527
01:22:19,762 --> 01:22:21,105
is incapable of crushing you.

1528
01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:22,971
How dare you?

1529
01:22:23,098 --> 01:22:26,204
Yet even you, Pendleton,

1530
01:22:27,436 --> 01:22:29,211
who should have been
gibbeted for treason

1531
01:22:29,305 --> 01:22:30,306
long before today.

1532
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:32,919
Even worthless, unworthy you

1533
01:22:33,008 --> 01:22:35,989
ought to be treated equally
before the law!

1534
01:22:37,813 --> 01:22:41,488
And so again, sir, again
and again and again I say,

1535
01:22:41,617 --> 01:22:44,723
I do not hold with equality in all things,

1536
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:47,061
only with equality before the law.

1537
01:22:50,993 --> 01:22:54,065
Mr. Speaker, will you permit
this vile, boorish man

1538
01:22:54,163 --> 01:22:56,609
to slander and to threaten me?

1539
01:22:56,866 --> 01:22:58,277
And to reduce these proceedings

1540
01:22:58,434 --> 01:23:01,677
on this most important matter
into an anarchic

1541
01:23:02,338 --> 01:23:04,579
and tawdry burlesque?

1542
01:23:28,864 --> 01:23:32,277
You asked if ever I was surprised.

1543
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:35,441
Today, Mr. Stevens,

1544
01:23:35,638 --> 01:23:36,616
I was surprised.

1545
01:23:37,539 --> 01:23:41,112
You've led the battle for
race equality for 30 years.

1546
01:23:46,482 --> 01:23:49,656
The basis of every hope for
this country's future life,

1547
01:23:49,752 --> 01:23:52,790
you denied Negro equality.
I'm nauseated.

1548
01:23:52,888 --> 01:23:55,459
You refused to say that all humans are...

1549
01:23:55,557 --> 01:23:57,298
Well, human.

1550
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:00,438
Have you lost your very soul,
Mr. Stevens?

1551
01:24:00,796 --> 01:24:02,036
Is there nothing you won't say?

1552
01:24:02,131 --> 01:24:03,804
I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa.

1553
01:24:03,899 --> 01:24:05,503
That must be unpleasant.

1554
01:24:06,735 --> 01:24:08,009
I want the amendment to pass,

1555
01:24:08,137 --> 01:24:10,048
so that the Constitution's first

1556
01:24:10,172 --> 01:24:11,515
and only mention of slavery

1557
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,813
is its absolute prohibition.

1558
01:24:13,909 --> 01:24:16,219
For this amendment, for which
I have worked all my life

1559
01:24:16,345 --> 01:24:18,951
and for which countless
colored men and women

1560
01:24:19,048 --> 01:24:20,152
have fought and died

1561
01:24:20,249 --> 01:24:23,230
and now hundreds
of thousands of soldiers...

1562
01:24:23,352 --> 01:24:24,888
No, sir, no.

1563
01:24:25,921 --> 01:24:29,061
It seems there's very nearly
nothing I won't say.

1564
01:25:00,052 --> 01:25:01,656
I'm not going in.

1565
01:25:06,792 --> 01:25:09,033
You said you wanted to help me.

1566
01:25:09,529 --> 01:25:13,272
But this is just a clumsy attempt
to discourage me.

1567
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:15,743
I've been to Army hospitals.
I've seen surgeries.

1568
01:25:15,868 --> 01:25:18,781
I went and visited
the malaria barges with Mama.

1569
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,748
She told me she didn't take you inside.

1570
01:25:20,873 --> 01:25:22,284
I snuck in afterwards.

1571
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:24,684
I've seen what it's like.
This changes nothing.

1572
01:25:27,547 --> 01:25:28,890
Well, at all rate, son,

1573
01:25:29,015 --> 01:25:30,824
I'm happy to have your company.

1574
01:25:37,557 --> 01:25:40,163
- Good morning, Jim.
- Hello, Mr. President.

1575
01:25:40,259 --> 01:25:42,068
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

1576
01:25:43,262 --> 01:25:46,835
Well, boys, first question.
You getting enough to eat?

1577
01:25:47,133 --> 01:25:48,168
Hello, sir.

1578
01:25:48,267 --> 01:25:49,610
- What's your name, soldier?
- Robert.

1579
01:25:49,735 --> 01:25:52,215
- Good to meet you, Robert.
- Nice to meet you.

1580
01:25:52,305 --> 01:25:53,386
- What's your name?
- Kevin.

1581
01:25:53,406 --> 01:25:54,407
Tell me your names as I go past.

1582
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:55,883
I'd like to know who I'm talking to. Kevin.

1583
01:25:55,975 --> 01:25:58,854
- Mr. President. John.
- John. I've seen you before.

1584
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:00,015
Mr. President.

1585
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:01,952
Make sure
you get some steak.

1586
01:26:02,081 --> 01:26:03,601
I wouldn't mind one myself, right now.

1587
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,470
What's the matter, Bob?

1588
01:27:26,832 --> 01:27:28,778
I have to do this, and I will do it.

1589
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:30,211
And I don't need
your permission to enlist.

1590
01:27:30,336 --> 01:27:34,216
That same speech has been made
by how many sons

1591
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,843
to how many fathers
since the war began?

1592
01:27:36,976 --> 01:27:38,148
"I don't need your damn permission,

1593
01:27:38,244 --> 01:27:40,781
you miserable old goat,
I'm gonna enlist anyhow."

1594
01:27:40,946 --> 01:27:41,924
And what wouldn't those

1595
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,356
numberless fathers have given

1596
01:27:43,449 --> 01:27:45,258
to be able to say to their sons

1597
01:27:45,384 --> 01:27:48,558
as I now say to mine,
"I'm Commander in Chief."

1598
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:50,966
So, in point of fact,
without my permission

1599
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:54,128
you ain't enlisting
in nothing nowhere, young man.

1600
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:56,706
It's Mama you're scared of,
it's not me getting killed.

1601
01:28:04,603 --> 01:28:07,209
I have to do this! And I will!

1602
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:10,780
Or I will feel ashamed of myself
for the rest of my life!

1603
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:12,890
Whether or not you fought
is what's gonna matter,

1604
01:28:12,978 --> 01:28:15,652
and not just to other people,
but to myself!

1605
01:28:15,781 --> 01:28:17,283
I won't be you, Pa, I can't do that,

1606
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:19,623
but I don't want to be nothing!

1607
01:28:23,022 --> 01:28:24,626
I can't lose you.

1608
01:28:30,896 --> 01:28:32,705
He'll be fine, Molly.

1609
01:28:32,798 --> 01:28:35,108
City Point's a way back
from the front lines

1610
01:28:35,234 --> 01:28:36,212
and the fighting.

1611
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:40,114
He'll be an adjutant, running
messages for General Grant.

1612
01:28:41,273 --> 01:28:43,412
The war will take our son.

1613
01:28:43,509 --> 01:28:46,080
A sniper, or a shrapnel shell, a typhus

1614
01:28:46,178 --> 01:28:47,156
same as took Willie.

1615
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:50,658
It takes hundreds of boys a day.
He'll die uselessly.

1616
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:53,127
And how will I ever forgive you?

1617
01:28:54,153 --> 01:28:56,656
Most men, their firstborn is their favorite.

1618
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:59,395
You've always blamed Robert
for being born.

1619
01:28:59,492 --> 01:29:00,800
For trapping you in a marriage

1620
01:29:00,926 --> 01:29:02,496
that's only ever given you grief

1621
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,733
- and caused you regret.
- That's simply not true.

1622
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:06,503
And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor's

1623
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:08,908
on your hands same as Grant,
God help us.

1624
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:11,474
We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood

1625
01:29:11,604 --> 01:29:13,811
you've sanctioned,
the uncountable corpses!

1626
01:29:13,939 --> 01:29:16,681
We'll be made to pay
with our son's dear blood!

1627
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:18,311
Just this once, Mrs. Lincoln,

1628
01:29:18,444 --> 01:29:21,186
I demand of you to try
and take the liberal

1629
01:29:21,313 --> 01:29:23,190
and not the selfish point of view.

1630
01:29:23,315 --> 01:29:24,521
Robert will never forgive himself.

1631
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:26,152
You imagine he'll forgive us

1632
01:29:26,285 --> 01:29:29,858
if we continue to stifle
this very natural ambition?

1633
01:29:30,956 --> 01:29:33,129
And if I refuse to take the high road?

1634
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:39,306
If I won't pick up the rough old cross,

1635
01:29:39,698 --> 01:29:42,508
will you threaten me again
with the madhouse?

1636
01:29:42,635 --> 01:29:46,105
As you did when I couldn't
stop crying over Willie.

1637
01:29:46,205 --> 01:29:48,651
When I showed you what heartbreak,

1638
01:29:48,741 --> 01:29:51,381
real heartbreak, looked like.

1639
01:29:51,477 --> 01:29:52,956
And you hadn't the courage

1640
01:29:53,045 --> 01:29:55,116
- to countenance, to help me!
- That's right, that's right...

1641
01:29:55,214 --> 01:29:57,490
When you refused so much
as to comfort Tad,

1642
01:29:57,583 --> 01:29:59,688
a child who was not only sick,
dangerously sick,

1643
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:00,820
but beside himself with grief!

1644
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,059
I was holding him in my arms
when he died.

1645
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:05,635
But your grief, your grief,
your inexhaustible grief!

1646
01:30:05,758 --> 01:30:07,601
How dare you throw that up at me?

1647
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:08,865
And his mother wouldn't let him near her

1648
01:30:08,994 --> 01:30:10,200
because she's screaming
from morning to night!

1649
01:30:10,329 --> 01:30:12,331
I couldn't risk him
seeing how angry I was!

1650
01:30:12,464 --> 01:30:13,909
Pacing the halls, howling at shadows

1651
01:30:13,999 --> 01:30:15,535
and furniture and ghosts!

1652
01:30:16,735 --> 01:30:18,715
I ought to have done it for Tad's sake,

1653
01:30:18,838 --> 01:30:20,579
for everybody's goddamn sake,

1654
01:30:20,706 --> 01:30:22,346
I should have clapped you
in the madhouse!

1655
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:23,852
Then do it!

1656
01:30:24,944 --> 01:30:26,753
Do it! Don't you threaten me!

1657
01:30:26,879 --> 01:30:29,223
You do it this time. Lock me away.

1658
01:30:29,348 --> 01:30:31,350
You'll have to, I swear,

1659
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:33,821
if Robert is killed.

1660
01:30:52,571 --> 01:30:54,949
I couldn't tolerate you
grieving so for Willie

1661
01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:57,680
because I couldn't permit it in myself.

1662
01:30:58,277 --> 01:31:00,257
Though I wanted to, Mary.

1663
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:03,124
I wanted to crawl under the earth,

1664
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:05,456
into the vault, with his coffin.

1665
01:31:06,886 --> 01:31:10,459
And I still do. Every day I do.

1666
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:13,527
Don't speak to me about grief.

1667
01:31:22,835 --> 01:31:26,578
I must make my decisions,
Bob must make his, you yours.

1668
01:31:26,672 --> 01:31:30,051
And bear what we must.
Hold and carry what we must.

1669
01:31:30,142 --> 01:31:33,817
What I carry within me,
you must allow me to do it.

1670
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:36,825
Alone, as I must. And you alone, Mary,

1671
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:40,487
you alone may lighten this burden.

1672
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,665
Or render it intolerable.

1673
01:31:44,156 --> 01:31:45,635
As you choose.

1674
01:32:07,479 --> 01:32:09,459
You think I'm ignorant
of what you're up to

1675
01:32:09,548 --> 01:32:10,583
because you haven't discussed

1676
01:32:10,683 --> 01:32:12,993
this scheme with me
as you ought to have done?

1677
01:32:13,118 --> 01:32:15,928
When have I ever been
so easily bamboozled?

1678
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:17,596
I believe you when you insist

1679
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:19,192
that amending the Constitution

1680
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:21,271
and abolishing slavery will end this war.

1681
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,704
And since you are
sending my son into the war,

1682
01:32:23,829 --> 01:32:26,833
woe unto you if you fail
to pass the amendment.

1683
01:32:30,069 --> 01:32:33,050
Seward doesn't want me
leaving big muddy footprints

1684
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:34,651
all over town.

1685
01:32:38,377 --> 01:32:40,448
(SOFTLY) No one has ever lived
who knows better than you

1686
01:32:40,546 --> 01:32:42,651
the proper placement of footfalls

1687
01:32:42,748 --> 01:32:44,625
on treacherous paths.

1688
01:32:44,717 --> 01:32:47,459
Seward can't do it. You must.

1689
01:32:48,253 --> 01:32:51,860
Because if you fail to acquire
the necessary votes,

1690
01:32:51,991 --> 01:32:54,835
woe unto you, sir. You will answer to me.

1691
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:10,516
Thank you.

1692
01:33:16,715 --> 01:33:19,525
I know the vote is only four days away.

1693
01:33:20,185 --> 01:33:21,823
I know you're concerned.

1694
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,991
Thank you for your concern over this.

1695
01:33:24,923 --> 01:33:27,699
And I want you to know,
they'll approve it.

1696
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:30,734
God will see to it.

1697
01:33:32,564 --> 01:33:34,566
I don't envy Him his task.

1698
01:33:36,368 --> 01:33:38,780
He may wish He'd chosen
an instrument for His purpose

1699
01:33:38,904 --> 01:33:41,885
more wieldy than
the House of Representatives.

1700
01:33:43,108 --> 01:33:44,917
Then you'll see to it.

1701
01:33:47,112 --> 01:33:50,559
Are you afraid of what
lies ahead for your people

1702
01:33:50,649 --> 01:33:52,128
if we succeed?

1703
01:33:53,619 --> 01:33:55,895
White people don't want us here.

1704
01:33:56,288 --> 01:33:58,700
- Many don't.
- What about you?

1705
01:34:04,163 --> 01:34:06,404
I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley.

1706
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:08,776
Any of you.

1707
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:13,250
You're familiar to me, as all people are,

1708
01:34:14,573 --> 01:34:17,554
unaccommodated, poor, bare,
forked creatures,

1709
01:34:17,643 --> 01:34:19,316
such as we all are.

1710
01:34:20,612 --> 01:34:23,320
You have a right to expect what I expect.

1711
01:34:23,816 --> 01:34:25,796
And likely our expectations

1712
01:34:25,918 --> 01:34:28,398
are not incomprehensible to each other.

1713
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:34,231
I assume I'll get used to you.

1714
01:34:35,427 --> 01:34:37,304
Now what you are to the nation,

1715
01:34:38,497 --> 01:34:41,000
what'll become of you
once slavery's day is done,

1716
01:34:41,366 --> 01:34:43,107
I don't know.

1717
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:47,307
What my people are to be, I can't say.

1718
01:34:49,508 --> 01:34:52,580
Negroes have been fighting
and dying for freedom

1719
01:34:53,178 --> 01:34:55,681
since the first of us was a slave.

1720
01:34:55,781 --> 01:34:59,251
I never heard any ask
what freedom would bring.

1721
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:03,024
Freedom is first.

1722
01:35:05,891 --> 01:35:07,268
As for me,

1723
01:35:08,694 --> 01:35:11,334
my son died fighting for the Union,

1724
01:35:12,598 --> 01:35:14,600
wearing the Union blue.

1725
01:35:15,234 --> 01:35:16,941
For freedom he died.

1726
01:35:19,071 --> 01:35:20,744
And I'm his mother.

1727
01:35:22,975 --> 01:35:25,854
That's what I am
to the nation, Mr. Lincoln.

1728
01:35:30,249 --> 01:35:31,956
What else must I be?

1729
01:35:41,627 --> 01:35:43,300
My whole hand's gonna be proud
in about five seconds.

1730
01:35:43,428 --> 01:35:44,964
Let's see how proud you can be.

1731
01:35:46,165 --> 01:35:48,736
Go away. That watch fob, is that gold?

1732
01:35:48,834 --> 01:35:50,404
You keep your eyes off my fob.

1733
01:35:50,502 --> 01:35:52,709
Gentlemen, you have a visitor.

1734
01:35:52,804 --> 01:35:54,909
BILBO: Goddamn!
LATHAM: Hey, Bill.

1735
01:35:57,109 --> 01:35:58,713
Well, I'll be fucked.

1736
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:00,255
I wouldn't bet against it.

1737
01:36:00,345 --> 01:36:01,483
Mr, uh?

1738
01:36:02,247 --> 01:36:03,658
W. N. Bilbo.

1739
01:36:03,782 --> 01:36:05,819
Yeah, Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.

1740
01:36:05,918 --> 01:36:06,896
Sir.

1741
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:08,798
Why are you hereNo offense,

1742
01:36:08,921 --> 01:36:12,232
but Mr. Seward's banished
the very mention of your name.

1743
01:36:12,324 --> 01:36:14,004
He won't even let us use fifty cent pieces

1744
01:36:14,092 --> 01:36:15,901
'cause they've got your face on 'em.

1745
01:36:16,695 --> 01:36:19,266
The Secretary of State here
tells me that you got

1746
01:36:19,364 --> 01:36:21,810
11 Democrats in the bag.
That's encouraging.

1747
01:36:21,934 --> 01:36:25,643
Oh, you've got no cause
to be encouraged, sir.

1748
01:36:26,872 --> 01:36:28,977
Are we being fired?

1749
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:34,289
"We have heard the chimes
at midnight, Master Shallow."

1750
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,759
I'm here to alert you boys

1751
01:36:36,848 --> 01:36:39,954
that the great day of reckoning
is nigh upon us.

1752
01:36:40,385 --> 01:36:42,296
The Democrats we've yet to bag, sir,

1753
01:36:42,387 --> 01:36:45,129
the patronage jobs simply won't bag 'em.

1754
01:36:45,224 --> 01:36:47,830
They require more convincing,
Mr. President.

1755
01:36:49,461 --> 01:36:52,340
Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, will you?

1756
01:36:52,497 --> 01:36:53,498
Sure.

1757
01:36:53,632 --> 01:36:55,634
It snagged my eye
in the paper this morning

1758
01:36:55,734 --> 01:36:57,145
that the Governor Curtin

1759
01:36:57,236 --> 01:36:59,546
is set to declare a winner in the disputed

1760
01:36:59,671 --> 01:37:00,649
Congressional election for the...

1761
01:37:00,739 --> 01:37:01,877
Pennsylvania 16th District.

1762
01:37:02,307 --> 01:37:05,049
District.
What a joy to be comprehended.

1763
01:37:05,177 --> 01:37:07,714
Hop on a train to Philadel,
call on the Governor...

1764
01:37:07,846 --> 01:37:09,189
Send Latham. Or Schell.

1765
01:37:09,314 --> 01:37:11,294
No, he'll do fine.
Just polish yourself up first.

1766
01:37:13,252 --> 01:37:15,323
The incumbent is claiming
he won it. Name of...

1767
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,455
Coffroth.

1768
01:37:16,555 --> 01:37:17,693
- That's him.
- Coffroth.

1769
01:37:17,823 --> 01:37:19,700
- He's a Democrat.
- I understand that.

1770
01:37:20,392 --> 01:37:22,463
- Silly name.
- A little bit silly.

1771
01:37:23,061 --> 01:37:25,974
Uh, tell Governor Curtin
it'd be much appreciated

1772
01:37:26,064 --> 01:37:28,670
if he'd invite
the House of Representatives

1773
01:37:28,767 --> 01:37:29,802
to decide who won.

1774
01:37:29,901 --> 01:37:32,507
He's entitled to do that. He'll agree to it.

1775
01:37:32,604 --> 01:37:34,880
Then advise Coffroth

1776
01:37:35,007 --> 01:37:37,351
if he hopes to retain his seat,

1777
01:37:37,442 --> 01:37:39,718
then he'd better pay a visit
to Thaddeus Stevens.

1778
01:37:39,845 --> 01:37:41,415
Well, pity poor Coffroth.

1779
01:37:43,749 --> 01:37:45,023
It opens!

1780
01:37:52,024 --> 01:37:53,401
You are Canfrey?

1781
01:37:55,427 --> 01:37:58,567
Coffroth, Mr. Stevens.
Alexander Coffroth.

1782
01:37:58,697 --> 01:38:01,610
Are we representatives
of the same state?

1783
01:38:01,733 --> 01:38:03,733
Yes, sir.
We sit only three desks apart.

1784
01:38:03,769 --> 01:38:05,578
I haven't noticed you.

1785
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:09,219
I'm a Republican and you,
Coughdrop, are a Democrat?

1786
01:38:09,308 --> 01:38:12,687
Well, uh, I, um,
that is to say...

1787
01:38:12,778 --> 01:38:14,758
The modern travesty
of Thomas Jefferson's

1788
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,018
political organization

1789
01:38:16,114 --> 01:38:17,855
to which you've attached
yourself like a barnacle

1790
01:38:17,949 --> 01:38:21,226
has the effrontery to call
itself the Democratic Party.

1791
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:24,267
You are a Democrat.
What's the matter with you?

1792
01:38:24,389 --> 01:38:25,959
Are you wicked?

1793
01:38:26,091 --> 01:38:27,627
- Well, I felt...
- Never mind.

1794
01:38:27,759 --> 01:38:29,966
Coff snot, you were
ignominiously trounced

1795
01:38:30,095 --> 01:38:31,615
at the hustings in November's election

1796
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:33,710
by your worthy challenger,
a Republican.

1797
01:38:33,799 --> 01:38:35,642
No, sir, I was not trounced.

1798
01:38:35,767 --> 01:38:37,747
He wants to steal my seat.
I didn't lose the election.

1799
01:38:37,836 --> 01:38:39,281
What difference does it make
if you lost or not?

1800
01:38:39,404 --> 01:38:43,546
The governor of our state
is... A Democrat?

1801
01:38:44,776 --> 01:38:47,086
No, he's, he's a...

1802
01:38:49,147 --> 01:38:50,125
Re...

1803
01:38:51,183 --> 01:38:52,389
Re...

1804
01:38:53,518 --> 01:38:55,759
- ...pub... lic...
- ...pub... lic...

1805
01:38:55,854 --> 01:38:57,390
- ...can.
- ...can. Republican.

1806
01:38:57,489 --> 01:38:59,662
I know what he is.
This is a rhetorical exercise.

1807
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:01,671
And Congress is controlled
by what partyYours?

1808
01:39:04,162 --> 01:39:05,937
Your party was beaten.

1809
01:39:06,031 --> 01:39:08,568
Your challenger's party
now controls the House

1810
01:39:08,667 --> 01:39:11,341
and hence the House
Committee on Elections,

1811
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:13,916
so you have been beaten.

1812
01:39:14,005 --> 01:39:16,918
You shall shortly be sent home
in disgrace. Unless...

1813
01:39:17,008 --> 01:39:18,089
I know what I must do, sir.

1814
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:20,351
I will immediately become
a Republican and vote yes...

1815
01:39:20,445 --> 01:39:21,423
No!

1816
01:39:22,214 --> 01:39:24,592
Coffroth will vote yes,

1817
01:39:25,217 --> 01:39:26,662
but Coffroth will remain a Democrat

1818
01:39:26,785 --> 01:39:27,763
until after he does so.

1819
01:39:27,853 --> 01:39:29,423
Why wait to switchI'm happy to...

1820
01:39:29,521 --> 01:39:31,762
We want to show the amendment
has bipartisan support,

1821
01:39:31,857 --> 01:39:33,803
you idiot. Early in the next Congress,

1822
01:39:33,892 --> 01:39:36,133
when I tell you to do so,
you will switch parties.

1823
01:39:36,228 --> 01:39:39,766
Now congratulations
on your victory, and get out.

1824
01:39:39,865 --> 01:39:42,311
Now, give me the names

1825
01:39:42,401 --> 01:39:44,347
of whoever else you've been hunting.

1826
01:39:44,703 --> 01:39:45,977
Aw, hell.

1827
01:39:46,371 --> 01:39:47,372
George Yeaman.

1828
01:39:47,506 --> 01:39:48,883
Yes. Yeaman.

1829
01:39:49,641 --> 01:39:51,120
Among others.

1830
01:39:51,209 --> 01:39:52,813
- But Yeaman, that'd count.
- Yeah.

1831
01:39:52,911 --> 01:39:54,686
Y-E-A-M-A-N.

1832
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:56,454
I got it.

1833
01:39:57,382 --> 01:39:58,554
Kentucky.

1834
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:04,424
I can't vote for
the amendment, Mr. Lincoln.

1835
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:14,169
I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,

1836
01:40:14,866 --> 01:40:17,176
filled with colored men in chains

1837
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:18,508
heading down the Mississippi

1838
01:40:18,637 --> 01:40:20,514
to the New Orleans slave markets.

1839
01:40:21,973 --> 01:40:23,145
It sickened me.

1840
01:40:24,509 --> 01:40:26,955
And more than that,
it brought a shadow down.

1841
01:40:28,513 --> 01:40:30,823
A pall around my eyes.

1842
01:40:32,517 --> 01:40:35,157
Slavery troubled me
as long as I can remember

1843
01:40:36,021 --> 01:40:38,228
in a way it never troubled my father,

1844
01:40:39,257 --> 01:40:41,533
though he hated it, in his own fashion.

1845
01:40:42,994 --> 01:40:44,905
He knew no smallholding dirt farmer

1846
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:46,703
could compete with slave plantations

1847
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:49,073
so he took us out from Kentucky

1848
01:40:49,201 --> 01:40:50,407
to get away from 'em.

1849
01:40:50,535 --> 01:40:52,310
He wanted Indiana kept free.

1850
01:40:53,905 --> 01:40:55,543
He wasn't a kind man

1851
01:40:57,175 --> 01:41:00,588
but there was a rough,
moral urge for fairness,

1852
01:41:00,712 --> 01:41:02,020
for freedom in him.

1853
01:41:03,114 --> 01:41:05,025
I learnt that from him, I suppose.

1854
01:41:05,951 --> 01:41:07,259
If little else from him.

1855
01:41:09,888 --> 01:41:12,095
We didn't care
for one another, Mr. Yeaman.

1856
01:41:15,727 --> 01:41:17,331
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1857
01:41:17,496 --> 01:41:20,500
Loving kindness, that most
ordinary thing, came to me

1858
01:41:20,599 --> 01:41:22,738
from other sources. I'm grateful for that.

1859
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:25,678
Well, I hate it, too, sir.

1860
01:41:27,072 --> 01:41:28,380
Slavery, but...

1861
01:41:29,474 --> 01:41:32,353
But we're entirely unready
for emancipation.

1862
01:41:32,911 --> 01:41:34,049
And there's too many questions...

1863
01:41:34,145 --> 01:41:35,453
We're unready for peace, too, ain't we?

1864
01:41:36,715 --> 01:41:38,922
Yeah, when it comes,
it'll present us with conundrums

1865
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:42,361
and dangers greater than
any we faced during the war,

1866
01:41:42,454 --> 01:41:44,195
bloody as it's been.

1867
01:41:44,289 --> 01:41:48,135
We'll have to extemporize and
experiment with what it is,

1868
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:49,364
when it is.

1869
01:41:52,764 --> 01:41:54,402
I read your speech, George.

1870
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,038
Negroes and the vote,

1871
01:41:58,169 --> 01:41:59,273
that's a puzzle.

1872
01:42:00,171 --> 01:42:03,744
No, no. But, but, but Negroes can't

1873
01:42:04,643 --> 01:42:07,647
uh, vote, Mr. Lincoln.

1874
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:10,552
You're not suggesting
we enfranchise colored people?

1875
01:42:10,749 --> 01:42:12,387
I'm asking only that

1876
01:42:12,484 --> 01:42:16,296
you disenthrall yourself
from the slave powers.

1877
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,926
I'll let you know when

1878
01:42:19,024 --> 01:42:20,664
there's an offer on my desk
for surrender.

1879
01:42:20,759 --> 01:42:21,931
There's none before us now.

1880
01:42:22,027 --> 01:42:23,131
What's before us now,

1881
01:42:23,261 --> 01:42:25,969
that's the vote on the 13th Amendment.

1882
01:42:27,365 --> 01:42:29,572
And it's going to be so very close.

1883
01:42:32,804 --> 01:42:34,750
You see what you can do.

1884
01:42:44,115 --> 01:42:45,594
I can't make sense of it.

1885
01:42:46,151 --> 01:42:48,097
What he died for.

1886
01:42:50,722 --> 01:42:52,998
Mr. Lincoln, I hate them all.

1887
01:42:53,124 --> 01:42:55,195
I do. All black people.

1888
01:43:04,736 --> 01:43:06,943
I am a prejudiced man.

1889
01:43:09,674 --> 01:43:11,551
Well, I'd change that in you if I could,

1890
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:13,187
but that's not why I come.

1891
01:43:14,012 --> 01:43:15,685
I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton,

1892
01:43:15,814 --> 01:43:19,193
but I expect colored people
most likely be free.

1893
01:43:20,085 --> 01:43:21,325
And when that's so, it's simple truth

1894
01:43:21,419 --> 01:43:23,399
that your brother's bravery

1895
01:43:23,521 --> 01:43:25,330
and his death helped make it so.

1896
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:28,231
Only you can decide whether

1897
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:29,760
that's sense enough for you or not.

1898
01:43:33,531 --> 01:43:35,306
My deepest sympathies to your family.

1899
01:43:48,046 --> 01:43:50,583
We've managed our members
to a fare-thee-well.

1900
01:43:51,916 --> 01:43:53,054
You've had no defections

1901
01:43:53,184 --> 01:43:55,095
from the Republican right to trouble you.

1902
01:43:56,421 --> 01:43:58,094
Whereas as to what you promised,

1903
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:01,170
where the hell are the commissioners?

1904
01:44:02,127 --> 01:44:04,573
Oh, my God. It's true.

1905
01:44:06,264 --> 01:44:08,505
You... You lied to me.

1906
01:44:08,867 --> 01:44:12,337
Mr. Lincoln, you evaded
my request for a denial

1907
01:44:12,437 --> 01:44:14,417
that there is a Confederate peace offer,

1908
01:44:14,539 --> 01:44:16,348
because there is one!

1909
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:20,679
We are absolutely guaranteed
to lose the whole thing.

1910
01:44:20,812 --> 01:44:23,691
We don't need a goddamn
abolition amendment!

1911
01:44:24,315 --> 01:44:26,090
Leave the Constitution alone!

1912
01:44:26,451 --> 01:44:27,555
What if
the peace commissioners

1913
01:44:27,652 --> 01:44:29,097
appear today, or worse...

1914
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:34,730
I can't listen to this anymore.

1915
01:44:36,961 --> 01:44:39,908
I can't accomplish a goddamn thing

1916
01:44:39,998 --> 01:44:42,478
of any human meaning or worth

1917
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:46,377
until we cure ourselves of slavery

1918
01:44:46,471 --> 01:44:49,145
and end this pestilential war!

1919
01:44:50,475 --> 01:44:53,081
And whether any of you
or anyone else knows it,

1920
01:44:53,178 --> 01:44:55,124
I know I need this!

1921
01:44:55,914 --> 01:44:58,554
This amendment is that cure!

1922
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,628
We are stepped out upon
the world stage now!

1923
01:45:04,756 --> 01:45:05,962
Now!

1924
01:45:06,624 --> 01:45:09,571
With the fate of human dignity
in our hands!

1925
01:45:11,429 --> 01:45:13,932
Blood's been spilt to
afford us this moment!

1926
01:45:14,199 --> 01:45:16,475
Now! Now! Now!

1927
01:45:17,302 --> 01:45:20,340
And you grousle and heckle
and dodge about like

1928
01:45:20,505 --> 01:45:22,416
pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters!

1929
01:45:23,675 --> 01:45:25,279
See what is before you.

1930
01:45:26,277 --> 01:45:29,019
See the here and now, that's the

1931
01:45:29,147 --> 01:45:32,185
hardest thing,
the only thing that accounts.

1932
01:45:34,185 --> 01:45:38,258
Abolishing slavery
by constitutional provision

1933
01:45:38,356 --> 01:45:42,099
settles the fate for all coming time

1934
01:45:43,394 --> 01:45:46,375
not only of the millions now in bondage

1935
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:51,447
but of unborn millions to come.

1936
01:45:53,037 --> 01:45:57,213
Two votes stand in its way.
These votes must be procured.

1937
01:46:01,646 --> 01:46:06,220
We need two yeses,
three abstentions, or

1938
01:46:06,351 --> 01:46:07,489
four yeses

1939
01:46:07,585 --> 01:46:11,260
and one more abstention,
and the amendment will pass.

1940
01:46:11,356 --> 01:46:12,957
You got a night, and a day, and a night,

1941
01:46:12,991 --> 01:46:14,334
and several perfectly good hours.

1942
01:46:14,425 --> 01:46:16,405
Now get the hell out of here and get 'em.

1943
01:46:17,262 --> 01:46:18,741
Yes. But how?

1944
01:46:20,999 --> 01:46:22,307
Buzzards' guts, man.

1945
01:46:24,903 --> 01:46:29,010
I am the President of the
United States of America

1946
01:46:29,774 --> 01:46:32,220
clothed in immense power.

1947
01:46:34,712 --> 01:46:37,022
You will procure me these votes.

1948
01:47:46,351 --> 01:47:49,127
We welcome you, ladies and gentlemen,

1949
01:47:51,122 --> 01:47:53,500
first in the history of
this people's chamber,

1950
01:47:54,993 --> 01:47:56,336
to your House.

1951
01:48:21,152 --> 01:48:22,713
Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.

1952
01:48:31,262 --> 01:48:33,208
On the matter of the
joint resolution before us,

1953
01:48:33,331 --> 01:48:34,412
presenting a 13th Amendment

1954
01:48:34,532 --> 01:48:36,739
to our National Constitution,

1955
01:48:36,868 --> 01:48:39,144
which was passed last year
by the Senate

1956
01:48:39,237 --> 01:48:40,648
and which has been debated now

1957
01:48:40,738 --> 01:48:43,241
by this estimable body
for the past several weeks,

1958
01:48:44,342 --> 01:48:45,548
today we will vote.

1959
01:48:51,049 --> 01:48:52,926
By mutual agreement,

1960
01:48:53,051 --> 01:48:55,258
we shall hear brief, final statements,

1961
01:48:56,888 --> 01:48:58,333
beginning with

1962
01:48:58,423 --> 01:49:00,664
the honorable
George Pendleton of Ohio.

1963
01:49:07,031 --> 01:49:08,339
I have just received

1964
01:49:10,301 --> 01:49:11,371
confirmation

1965
01:49:12,103 --> 01:49:14,447
of what previously has
been merely rumored.

1966
01:49:14,572 --> 01:49:17,109
Affidavits from loyal citizens

1967
01:49:17,241 --> 01:49:18,743
recently returned from Richmond.

1968
01:49:18,876 --> 01:49:21,413
They testify that
commissioners have indeed

1969
01:49:21,746 --> 01:49:23,020
come north and ought to have arrived

1970
01:49:23,114 --> 01:49:24,957
by now in Washington City

1971
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:28,030
bearing an offer of immediate cessation

1972
01:49:28,453 --> 01:49:29,591
of our civil war.

1973
01:49:31,956 --> 01:49:33,026
Is it true, sir?

1974
01:49:33,391 --> 01:49:35,632
Are there Confederate
commissioners in the capital?

1975
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,535
I have no idea where they are
or if they've arrived.

1976
01:49:37,628 --> 01:49:38,698
They'll arrive.

1977
01:49:39,063 --> 01:49:40,974
I appeal to
my fellow Democrats,

1978
01:49:41,099 --> 01:49:43,238
to all Republican representatives

1979
01:49:43,334 --> 01:49:44,745
who give a fig for peace,

1980
01:49:45,103 --> 01:49:47,083
postpone this vote!

1981
01:49:47,305 --> 01:49:48,375
Until we have answers

1982
01:49:48,506 --> 01:49:49,644
from the President himself!

1983
01:49:49,974 --> 01:49:50,952
Postpone the vote!

1984
01:49:51,409 --> 01:49:53,821
Postpone the vote!

1985
01:49:53,911 --> 01:49:56,721
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1986
01:49:57,181 --> 01:50:00,060
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1987
01:50:00,184 --> 01:50:01,390
Postpone the vote!

1988
01:50:01,686 --> 01:50:03,188
Postpone the vote!

1989
01:50:03,321 --> 01:50:05,001
- Postpone the vote!
 - Gentlemen!

1990
01:50:05,023 --> 01:50:06,400
Postpone the vote!

1991
01:50:06,891 --> 01:50:09,565
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1992
01:50:10,228 --> 01:50:12,071
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1993
01:50:14,032 --> 01:50:15,875
I have made a motion!

1994
01:50:15,967 --> 01:50:18,504
Does anyone care to second my motion?

1995
01:50:30,681 --> 01:50:31,819
Gentlemen.

1996
01:50:33,051 --> 01:50:34,587
The conservative faction

1997
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:36,824
of border and western Republicans

1998
01:50:36,921 --> 01:50:39,094
cannot approve this amendment,

1999
01:50:39,223 --> 01:50:41,260
about which we harbor grave doubts,

2000
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:45,564
if a peace offer is being
held hostage to its success.

2001
01:50:46,564 --> 01:50:48,444
Joining together with
our Democratic colleagues,

2002
01:50:48,566 --> 01:50:49,670
I second the motion

2003
01:50:49,767 --> 01:50:51,178
to postpone.

2004
01:50:51,269 --> 01:50:53,112
He must deny peace
commissioners are in the city.

2005
01:50:53,237 --> 01:50:54,511
Quick, man. Quick.

2006
01:51:44,188 --> 01:51:47,101
This is precisely
what Mr. Wood wishes me

2007
01:51:47,191 --> 01:51:48,431
to respond to?

2008
01:51:49,794 --> 01:51:51,501
Word for word, this is precisely

2009
01:51:51,629 --> 01:51:53,472
the assurance that he demands of me?

2010
01:51:53,998 --> 01:51:55,272
Yes, sir.

2011
01:52:15,052 --> 01:52:16,531
Give this to Mr. Ashley.

2012
01:52:20,057 --> 01:52:23,766
Uh, I feel I have to say,
Mr. Lincoln, that...

2013
01:52:24,896 --> 01:52:26,375
Could you please just step outside?

2014
01:52:26,797 --> 01:52:27,918
You want to have a chat now,

2015
01:52:27,965 --> 01:52:29,035
with the whole of the
House of Representatives

2016
01:52:29,167 --> 01:52:30,271
waiting on this?

2017
01:52:30,902 --> 01:52:33,280
Making false representation
to Congress, is...

2018
01:52:33,971 --> 01:52:35,507
- It's...
- It's impeachable,

2019
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:38,280
but I've made no such
false representation.

2020
01:52:38,709 --> 01:52:39,949
But there are.

2021
01:52:40,678 --> 01:52:42,118
There is a delegation from Richmond.

2022
01:52:42,747 --> 01:52:44,055
Give me the note, Johnnie.

2023
01:52:47,885 --> 01:52:49,660
Please, deliver that to Mr. Ashley.

2024
01:53:09,006 --> 01:53:10,144
From the President.

2025
01:53:11,075 --> 01:53:12,315
"So far as I know, there are no

2026
01:53:12,343 --> 01:53:13,720
peace commissioners in the city

2027
01:53:13,844 --> 01:53:15,152
nor are there likely to be."

2028
01:53:16,447 --> 01:53:18,085
"So far as I know"?

2029
01:53:19,517 --> 01:53:20,552
That means nothing.

2030
01:53:22,053 --> 01:53:25,034
Are there commissioners from
the South, or aren't there?

2031
01:53:26,457 --> 01:53:27,902
The President
has answered you, sir.

2032
01:53:28,025 --> 01:53:29,265
Your peace offer is a fiction.

2033
01:53:29,594 --> 01:53:30,732
That is not a denial.

2034
01:53:31,629 --> 01:53:33,165
It is a lawyer's dodge!

2035
01:53:34,632 --> 01:53:36,703
Mr. Haddam, is your faction satisfied?

2036
01:53:39,604 --> 01:53:42,084
The conservative Republican
faction is satisfied.

2037
01:53:42,206 --> 01:53:43,685
And we thank Mr. Lincoln.

2038
01:53:44,942 --> 01:53:46,922
I move to table Mr. Wood's motion.

2039
01:53:47,411 --> 01:53:48,412
Tabled!

2040
01:53:51,949 --> 01:53:54,555
Mr. Colfax, I order the main question.

2041
01:53:55,319 --> 01:53:57,128
A motion has been made to bring the bill

2042
01:53:57,255 --> 01:53:59,132
for the 13th Amendment to a vote.

2043
01:53:59,257 --> 01:54:00,258
Do I hear a second?

2044
01:54:00,458 --> 01:54:01,596
I second the motion.

2045
01:54:01,826 --> 01:54:04,067
So moved, so ordered.

2046
01:54:04,795 --> 01:54:05,899
The Clerk will now...

2047
01:54:05,997 --> 01:54:07,135
Quiet, please!

2048
01:54:08,799 --> 01:54:11,075
The Clerk will now
call the roll for the voting.

2049
01:54:17,174 --> 01:54:18,312
We begin with Connecticut.

2050
01:54:18,643 --> 01:54:20,316
Mr. Augustus Benjamin,

2051
01:54:20,444 --> 01:54:22,788
on the matter of this amendment,
how say you?

2052
01:54:23,281 --> 01:54:24,316
Nay!

2053
01:54:25,983 --> 01:54:27,462
Mr. Arthur Bentleigh.

2054
01:54:28,085 --> 01:54:29,792
Nay!

2055
01:54:33,257 --> 01:54:35,567
Mr. John Ellis, how say you?

2056
01:54:35,993 --> 01:54:36,994
ELLIS: Aye!

2057
01:54:37,128 --> 01:54:38,106
- What!

2058
01:54:44,835 --> 01:54:47,782
Missouri next. Mr. Walter Appleton.

2059
01:54:48,773 --> 01:54:50,013
APPLETON: I vote no.

2060
01:54:51,709 --> 01:54:52,949
Mr. Josiah Burton.

2061
01:54:54,512 --> 01:54:58,289
Beanpole Burton is pleased to vote yea!

2062
01:55:00,451 --> 01:55:01,759
The State of New Jersey.

2063
01:55:01,852 --> 01:55:03,991
- Mr. Nehemiah Cleary.
- No!

2064
01:55:06,857 --> 01:55:08,268
Mr. James Martinson.

2065
01:55:08,893 --> 01:55:10,930
Mr. Martinson has delegated me

2066
01:55:11,362 --> 01:55:13,103
to say he is indisposed.

2067
01:55:13,998 --> 01:55:15,306
And he abstains.

2068
01:55:17,735 --> 01:55:18,941
Mr. Austin J. Roberts.

2069
01:55:19,203 --> 01:55:21,479
Also indisposed, also abstaining.

2070
01:55:26,811 --> 01:55:28,051
Illinois concluded.

2071
01:55:30,314 --> 01:55:32,487
Mr. Harold Hollister. How say you?

2072
01:55:33,217 --> 01:55:34,218
No.

2073
01:55:35,219 --> 01:55:36,493
Mr. Hutton.

2074
01:55:37,755 --> 01:55:39,894
Mr. William Hutton. Cast your vote.

2075
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:44,897
William Hutton,
remembering at this moment

2076
01:55:45,029 --> 01:55:46,872
his beloved brother Frederick

2077
01:55:46,997 --> 01:55:49,307
votes against the amendment.

2078
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:02,749
Webster Allen votes no.

2079
01:56:06,083 --> 01:56:07,255
- Webster Allen,

2080
01:56:07,385 --> 01:56:09,865
Illinois, Democrat,

2081
01:56:09,954 --> 01:56:11,934
votes no.

2082
01:56:13,724 --> 01:56:17,501
Halberd Law, Indiana, Democrat,

2083
01:56:17,595 --> 01:56:19,006
votes no.

2084
01:56:21,232 --> 01:56:24,679
Archibald Moran, yes.

2085
01:56:27,438 --> 01:56:30,009
Ambrose Baylor, yes.

2086
01:56:31,909 --> 01:56:34,549
Mr. Walter H. Washburn.

2087
01:56:35,413 --> 01:56:36,551
WASHBURN: Votes no.

2088
01:56:40,317 --> 01:56:43,161
And Mr. George Yeaman, how say you?

2089
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:56,735
My vote ties us.

2090
01:57:00,871 --> 01:57:01,906
Sir, Mr. Yeaman,

2091
01:57:02,006 --> 01:57:03,679
I didn't hear your vote.

2092
01:57:04,508 --> 01:57:07,318
I said "Aye", Mr. McPherson!

2093
01:57:08,179 --> 01:57:09,180
Aye!

2094
01:57:09,346 --> 01:57:10,324
Traitor!

2095
01:57:10,481 --> 01:57:11,459
Order!

2096
01:57:25,062 --> 01:57:26,541
Order in my chamber!

2097
01:57:33,337 --> 01:57:36,147
Mr. McPherson, you may proceed.

2098
01:57:39,543 --> 01:57:41,955
Mr. Clay R. Hawkins of Ohio.

2099
01:57:52,189 --> 01:57:54,030
- Goddamn it, I'm voting yes.
(LOUD PROTESTS)

2100
01:57:54,925 --> 01:57:56,836
I don't care, you shoot me dead!

2101
01:57:56,927 --> 01:57:59,339
You shoot me dead! I am voting yes!

2102
01:58:00,865 --> 01:58:02,208
Mr. Edwin F. LeClerk.

2103
01:58:02,833 --> 01:58:03,811
No!

2104
01:58:06,670 --> 01:58:09,810
Oh, to hell with it.
Shoot me dead, too! Yes!

2105
01:58:13,177 --> 01:58:14,155
I mean...

2106
01:58:14,912 --> 01:58:17,358
Abstention. Abstention!

2107
01:58:21,752 --> 01:58:23,197
Spineless! No gender.

2108
01:58:29,693 --> 01:58:31,104
Mr. Alexander Coffroth.

2109
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,380
I vote

2110
01:58:39,136 --> 01:58:40,171
Yes.

2111
01:58:45,109 --> 01:58:46,179
 Yea.

2112
01:58:47,778 --> 01:58:49,280
James Brooks...

2113
01:58:50,314 --> 01:58:51,520
Nay.

2114
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:54,195
Josiah Grenelle...

2115
01:58:55,486 --> 01:58:56,692
Yea.

2116
01:58:57,821 --> 01:58:58,959
Meyer Strauss...

2117
01:59:00,324 --> 01:59:01,394
Nay.

2118
01:59:02,092 --> 01:59:04,094
- Mr. Joseph Marstern.
- Nay.

2119
01:59:04,228 --> 01:59:06,572
- Mr. Chilton A. Elliot.
- No!

2120
01:59:07,097 --> 01:59:09,077
- Mr. Daniel G. Stuart.
- I vote yes.

2121
01:59:09,466 --> 01:59:10,444
- Mr. Howard Guilfoyle.
- Yea.

2122
01:59:10,601 --> 01:59:11,944
- John F. McKenzie.
- Yea.

2123
01:59:12,136 --> 01:59:13,376
- Andrew E. Fink.
- Nay.

2124
01:59:13,437 --> 01:59:14,939
- Mr. John A. Castle.
- Yea.

2125
01:59:15,072 --> 01:59:16,415
- Mr. Hanready.
- Nay.

2126
01:59:16,607 --> 01:59:18,087
- And Mr. Rufus Warren?
- Yea.

2127
01:59:38,963 --> 01:59:40,670
The roll call concludes.

2128
01:59:41,198 --> 01:59:43,337
The voting is completed. Now...

2129
01:59:43,467 --> 01:59:46,175
Mr. Clerk, please call my name.

2130
01:59:47,338 --> 01:59:48,510
I want to cast a vote.

2131
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:49,845
I object.

2132
01:59:50,774 --> 01:59:52,117
The Speaker doesn't vote.

2133
01:59:52,443 --> 01:59:54,582
The Speaker may vote if he so chooses.

2134
01:59:55,012 --> 01:59:56,923
It is highly unusual, sir.

2135
01:59:57,147 --> 01:59:58,751
This isn't usual, Mr. Pendleton.

2136
01:59:58,849 --> 02:00:00,021
This is history.

2137
02:00:02,519 --> 02:00:04,931
How does Mr. Schuyler Colfax vote?

2138
02:00:09,793 --> 02:00:11,204
Aye, of course.

2139
02:00:34,518 --> 02:00:35,724
The final vote.

2140
02:00:37,588 --> 02:00:39,625
Eight absent or not voting.

2141
02:00:41,558 --> 02:00:43,333
Fifty-six votes against.

2142
02:00:44,595 --> 02:00:46,836
One hundred and nineteen votes for.

2143
02:00:47,898 --> 02:00:49,571
With a margin of two votes...

2144
02:01:38,415 --> 02:01:40,258
We chose great leadership.

2145
02:01:54,398 --> 02:01:56,239
We'll rally round the flag, boys ?

2146
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:58,041
We'll rally once again ?

2147
02:01:58,135 --> 02:02:00,115
Shouting the battle cry of freedom ?

2148
02:02:01,572 --> 02:02:03,984
We will rally from the hillside ?

2149
02:02:04,108 --> 02:02:05,985
We'll gather from the plain ?

2150
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:09,648
Shouting the battle cry of freedom ?

2151
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:14,290
The Union forever! ?
Hurrah, boys, hurrah! ?

2152
02:02:14,418 --> 02:02:16,227
Down with the traitor ?

2153
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:17,993
And up with the star ?

2154
02:02:18,255 --> 02:02:22,135
Shout, shout the battle cry of Freedom! ?

2155
02:02:22,459 --> 02:02:24,063
Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.

2156
02:02:24,161 --> 02:02:26,232
The bill, Mr. McPherson. May I?

2157
02:02:28,699 --> 02:02:32,169
The Union forever! ?
Hurrah, boys, hurrah! ?

2158
02:02:32,536 --> 02:02:35,073
That's, that's the official bill.

2159
02:02:35,172 --> 02:02:37,174
I'll return it in the morning.

2160
02:02:37,808 --> 02:02:39,151
Creased,

2161
02:02:40,043 --> 02:02:41,021
but unharmed.

2162
02:02:41,145 --> 02:02:44,786
Shouting the battle cry of freedom ?

2163
02:02:44,882 --> 02:02:49,160
We are springing to the call ?
Of the loyal, true and brave ?

2164
02:02:49,353 --> 02:02:50,714
Shouting the battle cry of freedom ?

2165
02:02:52,956 --> 02:02:55,095
And we'll fill our vacant ranks ?

2166
02:02:55,192 --> 02:02:57,103
With a million freemen more ?

2167
02:02:57,995 --> 02:03:00,703
Shouting the battle cry of freedom ?

2168
02:03:01,899 --> 02:03:03,435
The Union forever! ?

2169
02:03:04,301 --> 02:03:05,780
Hurrah, boys, hurrah! ?

2170
02:03:06,370 --> 02:03:09,783
Down with the traitor ?
And up with the star ??

2171
02:03:31,728 --> 02:03:33,833
A gift for you.

2172
02:03:38,202 --> 02:03:40,239
The greatest measure
of the 19th century,

2173
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:41,405
passed by corruption,

2174
02:03:41,538 --> 02:03:44,747
aided and abetted by
the purest man in America.

2175
02:04:03,427 --> 02:04:05,338
I wish you had been present.

2176
02:04:06,129 --> 02:04:08,200
- I wish I'd been.
- It was a spectacle.

2177
02:04:09,099 --> 02:04:11,545
You can't bring your
housekeeper to the House.

2178
02:04:11,635 --> 02:04:13,615
I won't give them gossip.

2179
02:04:13,737 --> 02:04:15,239
This is enough.

2180
02:04:15,639 --> 02:04:16,743
This is...

2181
02:04:18,442 --> 02:04:20,217
It's more than enough for now.

2182
02:04:21,812 --> 02:04:23,519
Read it to me again, my love.

2183
02:04:25,549 --> 02:04:27,392
- "Proposed..."
- And adopted.

2184
02:04:27,484 --> 02:04:28,861
"Adopted,

2185
02:04:29,553 --> 02:04:30,623
an amendment to

2186
02:04:30,754 --> 02:04:33,701
the Constitution of the United States."

2187
02:04:33,790 --> 02:04:35,201
Section One.

2188
02:04:35,626 --> 02:04:39,403
"Neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude

2189
02:04:39,496 --> 02:04:42,272
except as a punishment for crime

2190
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:45,812
whereof the party shall
have been duly convicted

2191
02:04:46,403 --> 02:04:49,213
shall exist within the United States

2192
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:53,153
or any place subject
to their jurisdiction."

2193
02:04:53,277 --> 02:04:54,654
Section Two.

2194
02:04:55,178 --> 02:04:59,320
"Congress shall have power
to enforce this amendment

2195
02:04:59,449 --> 02:05:01,429
by appropriate legislation."

2196
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:24,812
Let me be blunt.

2197
02:05:25,542 --> 02:05:27,180
Will the Southern states

2198
02:05:27,311 --> 02:05:29,814
resume their former position
in the Union

2199
02:05:29,947 --> 02:05:31,426
speedily enough to enable us

2200
02:05:31,515 --> 02:05:34,086
to block ratification to this here

2201
02:05:34,184 --> 02:05:35,322
13th Amendment?

2202
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:41,492
I'd like peace immediately.

2203
02:05:42,492 --> 02:05:43,869
Yes, and?

2204
02:05:46,797 --> 02:05:49,334
I'd like your states restored to

2205
02:05:49,466 --> 02:05:53,004
their practical relations
with the Union immediately.

2206
02:05:55,806 --> 02:05:57,843
If this could be given to me in writing,

2207
02:05:58,408 --> 02:06:00,319
as Vice President of the Confederacy,

2208
02:06:00,410 --> 02:06:01,718
I'd bring that document

2209
02:06:01,845 --> 02:06:03,654
with celerity, to Jefferson Davis.

2210
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:07,454
Surrender.

2211
02:06:07,985 --> 02:06:10,295
And we can discuss reconstruction.

2212
02:06:12,155 --> 02:06:13,691
Surrender won't be thought of.

2213
02:06:14,524 --> 02:06:17,664
Unless you've assured us, in writing,

2214
02:06:17,761 --> 02:06:20,469
that we'll be readmitted
in time to block this amendment.

2215
02:06:21,064 --> 02:06:24,568
This is the arrogant demand
of a conqueror.

2216
02:06:24,835 --> 02:06:27,679
You'll not be
a conquered people, Mr. Hunter.

2217
02:06:27,771 --> 02:06:29,216
You will be citizens.

2218
02:06:30,407 --> 02:06:31,977
Returned to the laws and
the guarantees of rights

2219
02:06:32,075 --> 02:06:33,053
of the Constitution.

2220
02:06:34,011 --> 02:06:36,651
Which now extinguishes slavery.

2221
02:06:36,747 --> 02:06:39,489
And with it, our economy.

2222
02:06:39,850 --> 02:06:41,211
All our laws will be determined by

2223
02:06:41,251 --> 02:06:42,855
a Congress of vengeful Yankees.

2224
02:06:43,687 --> 02:06:46,190
All our rights will be subject
to a Supreme Court

2225
02:06:46,923 --> 02:06:48,903
benched by bloody Republican radicals.

2226
02:06:49,593 --> 02:06:52,506
All our traditions will be obliterated.

2227
02:06:53,463 --> 02:06:55,204
We won't know ourselves anymore.

2228
02:06:57,267 --> 02:06:59,679
We ain't here to discuss reconstruction.

2229
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:02,114
We have no legal basis
for that discussion.

2230
02:07:02,239 --> 02:07:03,843
But I don't want to deal falsely.

2231
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:06,443
The Northern states
will ratify, most of them.

2232
02:07:06,576 --> 02:07:08,351
As I figure it, it remains for
two of the Southern states

2233
02:07:08,445 --> 02:07:09,446
to do the same,

2234
02:07:09,579 --> 02:07:11,217
even after all are readmitted.

2235
02:07:11,314 --> 02:07:12,884
And I've been working on that.

2236
02:07:13,884 --> 02:07:14,954
Tennessee and Louisiana.

2237
02:07:15,419 --> 02:07:17,592
Arkansas, too, most likely.
It'll be ratified.

2238
02:07:18,321 --> 02:07:21,063
Slavery, sir... It's done.

2239
02:07:34,571 --> 02:07:37,279
If we submit ourselves to law, Alex,

2240
02:07:38,075 --> 02:07:40,055
even submit to losing freedoms,

2241
02:07:41,478 --> 02:07:43,617
the freedom to oppress, for instance

2242
02:07:44,781 --> 02:07:46,556
we may discover other freedoms

2243
02:07:46,716 --> 02:07:48,195
previously unknown to us.

2244
02:07:49,286 --> 02:07:52,790
Had you kept faith
with the democratic process,

2245
02:07:52,923 --> 02:07:54,334
as frustrating as that can be...

2246
02:07:54,458 --> 02:07:55,664
Come, sir.

2247
02:07:55,826 --> 02:07:58,306
Spare us, at least, these pieties.

2248
02:07:59,296 --> 02:08:00,832
Did you defeat us with ballots?

2249
02:08:02,332 --> 02:08:04,141
How have you held your Union together?

2250
02:08:05,168 --> 02:08:06,340
Through democracy?

2251
02:08:07,637 --> 02:08:09,344
How many hundreds
of thousands have died

2252
02:08:09,473 --> 02:08:10,850
during your administration?

2253
02:08:12,309 --> 02:08:14,915
Your Union, sir, is bonded
in cannon fire and death.

2254
02:08:18,715 --> 02:08:20,126
It may be you're right.

2255
02:08:24,554 --> 02:08:27,364
But say all we done is show the world

2256
02:08:27,491 --> 02:08:29,630
that democracy isn't chaos.

2257
02:08:32,329 --> 02:08:35,776
That there is a great, invisible strength

2258
02:08:35,866 --> 02:08:37,209
in a people's union.

2259
02:08:38,168 --> 02:08:42,014
Say we've shown that a people
can endure awful sacrifice

2260
02:08:42,139 --> 02:08:43,777
and yet cohere.

2261
02:08:44,407 --> 02:08:45,545
Mightn't that save at least

2262
02:08:45,675 --> 02:08:47,882
the idea of democracy to aspire to?

2263
02:08:49,379 --> 02:08:51,655
Eventually to become worthy of?

2264
02:08:55,852 --> 02:08:57,729
At all rates, whatever may be proven

2265
02:08:57,854 --> 02:09:00,027
by blood and sacrifice

2266
02:09:00,157 --> 02:09:01,659
must have been proved by now.

2267
02:09:12,068 --> 02:09:14,173
Shall we stop this bleeding?

2268
02:10:52,836 --> 02:10:53,814
Once he surrenders,

2269
02:10:53,937 --> 02:10:55,678
send his boys back to their homes

2270
02:10:56,539 --> 02:10:58,143
and their farms, their shops.

2271
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:01,180
Yes, sir.

2272
02:11:02,545 --> 02:11:03,523
As we discussed.

2273
02:11:03,647 --> 02:11:05,820
Liberality all around, not punishment.

2274
02:11:05,949 --> 02:11:06,984
I don't want that.

2275
02:11:07,884 --> 02:11:10,763
And their leaders,
Jeff and the rest of them,

2276
02:11:10,854 --> 02:11:12,128
they escape, leave the country

2277
02:11:12,222 --> 02:11:14,702
while my back's turned,
that wouldn't upset me none.

2278
02:11:16,059 --> 02:11:18,767
When peace comes,
it mustn't just be hangings.

2279
02:11:25,235 --> 02:11:26,771
By outward appearance

2280
02:11:28,538 --> 02:11:31,314
you're 10 years older
than you were a year ago.

2281
02:11:31,875 --> 02:11:32,979
Hmm.

2282
02:11:34,678 --> 02:11:36,885
Some weariness has bit at my bones.

2283
02:11:50,393 --> 02:11:52,669
I never seen the like of it before,

2284
02:11:52,762 --> 02:11:54,241
what I seen today.

2285
02:11:55,865 --> 02:11:57,674
Never seen the like of it before.

2286
02:12:00,403 --> 02:12:01,905
You always knew that.

2287
02:12:03,373 --> 02:12:04,875
What this was going to be.

2288
02:12:06,743 --> 02:12:08,814
Intimate and ugly.

2289
02:12:12,015 --> 02:12:13,494
You must have needed to see it close

2290
02:12:13,583 --> 02:12:14,983
when you decided to come down here.

2291
02:12:16,019 --> 02:12:17,054
Hmm.

2292
02:12:34,237 --> 02:12:37,878
We've made it possible for
one another to do terrible things.

2293
02:12:40,276 --> 02:12:41,846
We've won the war.

2294
02:12:42,879 --> 02:12:46,190
Now you have to lead us out of it.

2295
02:14:18,241 --> 02:14:19,845
You have an itch to travel?

2296
02:14:20,210 --> 02:14:22,019
Mm-hmm. I'd like that.

2297
02:14:23,546 --> 02:14:25,787
To the West, by rail.

2298
02:14:25,882 --> 02:14:27,225
Overseas.

2299
02:14:29,419 --> 02:14:30,557
The Holy Land.

2300
02:14:33,590 --> 02:14:35,194
Awfully pious for a man

2301
02:14:35,325 --> 02:14:37,828
who takes his wife out
buggy-riding on Good Friday.

2302
02:14:38,595 --> 02:14:39,733
Jerusalem.

2303
02:14:40,363 --> 02:14:42,172
Where David and Solomon walked.

2304
02:14:42,532 --> 02:14:45,979
I dream of walking in that ancient city.

2305
02:14:52,275 --> 02:14:53,982
All anyone will remember of me

2306
02:14:54,077 --> 02:14:56,717
is I was crazy and
I ruined your happiness.

2307
02:14:57,514 --> 02:15:00,017
Anyone thinks that
doesn't understand, Molly.

2308
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:05,399
When they look at you,

2309
02:15:06,923 --> 02:15:09,665
at what it cost to live at the heart of this,

2310
02:15:11,194 --> 02:15:13,401
they'll wonder at it.
They'll wonder at you.

2311
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:14,668
They should.

2312
02:15:16,032 --> 02:15:17,204
But they should also look at

2313
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:18,836
the wretched woman by your side

2314
02:15:18,935 --> 02:15:21,745
if they want to understand
what this was truly like.

2315
02:15:22,906 --> 02:15:24,385
For the ordinary person.

2316
02:15:25,441 --> 02:15:27,011
For anyone other than you.

2317
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:28,917
You must try to be happier.

2318
02:15:29,913 --> 02:15:31,415
We must, both of us.

2319
02:15:31,981 --> 02:15:34,188
We've been so miserable for so long.

2320
02:15:43,893 --> 02:15:46,669
I did say some colored men...

2321
02:15:46,763 --> 02:15:49,209
The intelligent, the educated, and the

2322
02:15:49,299 --> 02:15:51,245
veterans. I qualified it.

2323
02:15:51,367 --> 02:15:52,846
Mr. Stevens is furious.

2324
02:15:52,936 --> 02:15:54,609
He wants to know why you qualified it.

2325
02:15:54,737 --> 02:15:56,944
No one heard
the intelligent or educated part.

2326
02:15:57,073 --> 02:15:59,075
All they heard was the first time

2327
02:15:59,208 --> 02:16:01,882
any president has ever made mention

2328
02:16:01,978 --> 02:16:03,286
of Negro voting.

2329
02:16:03,713 --> 02:16:07,456
Still, I wish I'd mentioned it
in a better speech.

2330
02:16:07,584 --> 02:16:09,291
Mr. Stevens also wants to know

2331
02:16:09,419 --> 02:16:11,228
why you didn't make a better speech.

2332
02:16:13,957 --> 02:16:15,231
Mrs. Lincoln is
waiting in the carriage.

2333
02:16:15,358 --> 02:16:17,804
She wants me to remind you
of the hour, and that

2334
02:16:17,927 --> 02:16:20,669
you'll have to pick up
Miss Harris and Major Rathbone.

2335
02:16:24,233 --> 02:16:26,042
- Am I in trouble?
- No, sir.

2336
02:16:26,569 --> 02:16:27,912
Thank you, Mr. Slade.

2337
02:16:43,486 --> 02:16:44,931
I suppose it's time to go.

2338
02:16:46,556 --> 02:16:48,160
Though I would rather stay.

2339
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:20,358
The President has been shot!

2340
02:18:23,352 --> 02:18:24,558
The President

2341
02:18:24,687 --> 02:18:27,395
has been shot! At Ford's Theater!

2342
02:18:33,096 --> 02:18:35,269
No. No!

2343
02:19:09,298 --> 02:19:12,609
It's 7:22 in the morning.

2344
02:19:13,669 --> 02:19:15,376
Saturday, the 15th of April.

2345
02:19:15,471 --> 02:19:16,745
It's all over.

2346
02:19:16,839 --> 02:19:18,250
The President is no more.

2347
02:19:22,011 --> 02:19:23,957
Now he belongs to the ages.

2348
02:19:30,319 --> 02:19:32,060
Fondly do we hope,

2349
02:19:33,756 --> 02:19:35,758
fervently do we pray,

2350
02:19:37,326 --> 02:19:40,273
that this mighty scourge of war,

2351
02:19:40,363 --> 02:19:42,309
may speedily pass away.

2352
02:19:45,434 --> 02:19:47,937
Yet if God wills that it continue

2353
02:19:48,604 --> 02:19:50,914
until all the wealth piled

2354
02:19:51,007 --> 02:19:54,113
by the bondman's 250 years

2355
02:19:54,210 --> 02:19:57,248
of unrequited toil shall be sunk

2356
02:19:58,614 --> 02:20:02,653
and until every drop of blood
drawn with the lash

2357
02:20:02,785 --> 02:20:06,426
shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword

2358
02:20:07,723 --> 02:20:10,101
as was said 3,000 years ago,

2359
02:20:10,193 --> 02:20:12,366
so still it must be said,

2360
02:20:13,296 --> 02:20:15,105
"The judgments of the Lord

2361
02:20:16,032 --> 02:20:20,378
are true and righteous altogether."

2362
02:20:26,142 --> 02:20:27,815
With malice toward none,

2363
02:20:30,046 --> 02:20:32,048
with charity for all,

2364
02:20:33,749 --> 02:20:35,456
with firmness in the right,

2365
02:20:35,551 --> 02:20:37,827
as God gives us to see the right,

2366
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:41,060
let us strive on to finish
the work we are in,

2367
02:20:41,858 --> 02:20:44,168
to bind up the nation's wounds,

2368
02:20:45,061 --> 02:20:46,506
to care

2369
02:20:46,863 --> 02:20:49,173
for him who shall have borne the battle

2370
02:20:50,499 --> 02:20:52,376
and for his widow

2371
02:20:53,035 --> 02:20:54,241
and his orphan,

2372
02:20:56,038 --> 02:21:00,180
to do all which may achieve and cherish

2373
02:21:01,377 --> 02:21:05,985
a just and a lasting peace
among ourselves

2374
02:21:07,416 --> 02:21:09,418
and with all nations.
