2
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,288
Hey, what do
you say, Curt?
Last night in town,

3
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,123
you guys gonna
have a little bash
before you leave?

4
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,666
The Moose have been
looking for you all day.

5
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,168
They got worried.
Thought you were trying

6
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,628
to avoid them
or something.

7
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,379
What is it?
What've you got?

8
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,758
Oh, great.

9
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,135
That's $2,000, man.
$2,000!

10
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,262
Mr. Jennings gave it
to me to give to you.

11
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,555
He says he's sorry
it's so late,

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,681
but it's
the first scholarship

13
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,433
the Moose Lodge
has given out.

14
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,937
And he says they're
all very proud of you
back at the Lodge.

15
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,313
Cute. Why don't you
hold it for me
for a while?

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,815
Hey, I don't want it.
Take it. It's yours.

17
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,566
I'll take it.

18
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,778
Listen,
if your sister calls...

19
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,738
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

20
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,948
She can wait.

21
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,491
Make it short and sweet,
though, huh?

22
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,742
Listen,

23
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,912
I don't think I'm gonna
be going tomorrow.

24
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,123
Come on, what are you
talking about?

25
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,417
Well, I was thinking
I could wait a year,
you know.

26
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,212
Go to City for a while.

27
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,798
You chicken fink.
Wait a minute.

28
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,717
After all we went through
to get accepted?

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,344
We're finally getting
out of this turkey town,

30
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,806
and now you want
to crawl back into
your cell, right?

31
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,310
You want to end up
like John?

32
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,145
You just can't
stay 17 forever.

33
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,856
It's just...
You've got to get that
through your head!

34
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,316
I just need some time.

35
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,319
I've got to
go talk to Laurie.
Now take it. Take it!

36
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,947
Now, we're leaving in
the morning, all right?

37
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,033
We're leaving
in the morning.

38
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,129
We're gonna rock and roll
ourselves to death, baby.

39
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,631
You got
The Wolfman Jack show!

40
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,670
Don't...
Don't with the thing!

41
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,088
Will you stop it with
the Big Bopper stuff?

42
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,340
Hi, John.

43
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,634
- Hi, John.
- Not too good, huh?

44
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,344
Why is it every girl
that comes around here

45
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,638
is ugly,
or has a boyfriend?

46
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,306
Where is
the dazzling beauty

47
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,725
I've been searching for
all my life?

48
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,644
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

49
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,438
The pickings are
really getting slim.

50
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,690
The whole strip
is shrinking.

51
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,736
I remember about
five years ago,

52
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,321
take you
a couple of hours and

53
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,741
a tank full of gas
just to make one circuit.

54
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,369
It was really something.

55
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,168
Hey, John.

56
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,711
Someone new in town.

57
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,547
You gonna go after him?

58
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,549
Hey, listen, Professor.

59
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,512
If he can't find me,
then he ain't even
worth racing, right?

60
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,138
Big shot.

61
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,057
Well?

62
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,728
Where was I?

63
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,690
How you thought
high school romances
were goofy

64
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,941
and we started
going together

65
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,985
just because
you thought I was
kind of cute and funny,

66
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,112
but then
you suddenly realized
you were in love with me,

67
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,447
it was serious, and...

68
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,996
Oh. You were leading up
to something kind of big.

69
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,040
You make it sound like
I'm giving dictation.

70
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,836
Well, seriously,

71
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,008
what I meant was
that since we do care
for each other so much,

72
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,554
and since we should
really consider ourselves
as adults now,

73
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,598
I...

74
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,769
Could I have a couple
of those fries?

75
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,605
Come on, Budda.
Come on.

76
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,149
Where was I?

77
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,276
"Consider
ourselves adults."
Right. Right.

78
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,779
I thought maybe,
before I leave,

79
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,949
we could agree

80
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,454
that seeing other
people while I'm away

81
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,165
can't possibly hurt,
you know?

82
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,339
You mean
dating other people?

83
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,009
I think
it would strengthen
our relationship.

84
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,304
Then we'd know for sure
that we're really in love.

85
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,639
Not that
there's any doubt.

86
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,317
I think you're right.

87
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,028
I mean,
we're not kids anymore,

88
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,281
and it's silly to think
that when we're
3,000 miles apart,

89
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,784
we shouldn't be able
to see other people
and go out.

90
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,286
Laurie, listen,
I didn't ask
for that back.

91
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,164
I know. I just sort of
think it's juvenile now.

92
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,541
I'll keep it at home.
It's less conspicuous there.

93
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,585
You don't want
to wear it?
I didn't say that.

94
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,921
I understand,
and I'm not upset.

95
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,298
I mean,
I can't expect you

96
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,801
to be a monk
or something
while you're away.

97
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,929
And I got a really neat
record collection.

98
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,681
I even got
Pledging My Love
by Johnny Ace.

99
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,974
Look, how can
you love Nelson

100
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,434
when he's going out
with Marilyn Gator?

101
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,769
Since he dumped
on you, I was...

102
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,938
He didn't dump on me,
you little dip!

103
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,606
Oh, hi, Steve.
Hey.

104
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
Hey, Sis.

105
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,449
What's wrong?
Nothing.

106
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,494
What is it?
Nothing!

107
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,665
And I've decided
that I'm gonna let you

108
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,625
take care of my car
for me while I'm away.

109
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,127
At least until Christmas.

110
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,796
See, I'm coming back
for a couple of weeks
at Christmas.

111
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,799
Now, I've got some
very simple instructions
for you.

112
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,134
Here's the keys.

113
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,220
First of all,
only 30-weight Castrol R.

114
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,389
Now, I've written
the tire pressure
and stuff

115
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
on a pad
in the glove...

116
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,142
Are you listening?

117
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,393
Hey, what's wrong?

118
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,728
Are you crying?

119
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,148
I can't believe it.

120
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,483
I don't know
what to say.

121
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,904
I'll love
and protect this car
until death do us part.

122
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,157
This is
a super fine machine.

123
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,285
This might even be better
than Darryl Starbird's
Superfleck Moon...

124
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,247
It is! It's better
than Darryl Starbird's
Superfleck Moonbird.

125
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,748
Budda?

126
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,916
Yeah?

127
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,836
How would you like to go
to the drive-in movies
with me?

128
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,172
You've got
to be kidding.

129
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,132
No! Would I kid you
about a thing like that?

130
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,050
I have a new car. Hey!

131
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,600
Hey, hey,
did she do that to you?

132
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,059
Hey, Curt,
you want to bomb around?

133
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,353
I want to try out
my new wheels.

134
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,605
Well, I'd like to, Toad,

135
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,773
but I'm gonna go
with Steve and Laurie
to the hop.

136
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,193
And besides,
I'd spoil your luck,
anyway.

137
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,944
Yeah. Right.

138
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,613
Tonight, things are
gonna be different.

139
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,072
Hey, hey,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

140
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,658
You're going to the hop?
The freshman hop?

141
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,076
Yeah.
Oh, come on, man.

142
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,705
That place is for kids.
You two just got
your ass out of there.

143
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,040
Don't go back there.

144
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,208
You ain't got
no emotions?

145
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,919
We are going to remember
all of the good times,

146
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,337
is what we're gonna do.

147
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,671
Yeah, well, go.

148
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,423
Why won't you
come with us?

149
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,716
Bullshit, man!

150
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,051
Come on.
For old times' sake.

151
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,636
Yeah, yeah.
Well, listen. You go.

152
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,388
Go ahead, Curtsy baby.
You go on over there
and you remember

153
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,390
all the good times
you won't be having.

154
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,893
I ain't going off
to some goddamned
fancy college!

155
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,104
I'm staying right here!
Having fun, as usual.

156
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:30,069
Jesus, Milner! You're
really in a great mood
tonight, you know that?

157
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,654
What's the matter,
John?

158
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,035
Did I do something wrong?
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,704
Ah, man, it's nothing.

160
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,541
Well, then we'll
see you later, okay?

161
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,751
Right.

162
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,961
We'll all do
something together,

163
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,545
you know,
before Steve leaves.

164
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,838
Yeah.

165
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,676
Oh, wait a minute.
Now you're not going?

166
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,761
I don't know.
Oh.

167
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,180
Jesus.

168
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,596
Hey, Zudo.

169
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,015
Hey, Milner!

170
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,975
Hey, man,
what happened
to your flathead?

171
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,101
Huh?

172
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,352
What happened
to your flathead?

173
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,562
Your mother!

174
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,314
What?

175
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,941
Your mother!
Hey, we been
talking about you.

176
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:52,735
Yeah?

177
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,530
Yeah. There's a very
wicked '55 Chevy
looking for you.

178
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,781
Yeah, I know.

179
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,242
Watch out for the cop
that's in Jerry's Cherry.

180
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,910
Yeah. All right, thanks.

181
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,262
Hey, Toad!

182
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,349
Is that you in
that beautiful car?

183
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,018
Jeez, what a waste
of machinery.

184
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,115
Hey, kid!

185
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,630
All right, baby.

186
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,548
Here we go
with another call
out of the station.

187
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,175
Can you dig it?

188
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,719
Answer the phone, dummy!

189
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,721
- Pinkie's Pizza.
- Yeah, listen,

190
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,557
you got any more
of those secret
agent spy scopes?

191
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,726
Hit parade
on the stethoscope?
No, no.

192
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,020
The secret agent
spy scope, man,

193
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,564
that pulls in the moon,
the stars, the planets,

194
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,192
and the satellites,
and the little
bitty space men.

195
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,652
You must have
the wrong number,
partner.

196
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,070
Bye!

197
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,416
What?

198
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,335
What did you say?
Wait. What did you say?

199
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,254
What did you say?

200
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,006
Quick. Quick.
Hang a right.

201
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,091
What? Why?

202
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,926
Steven,
cut over to G Street.

203
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,762
I just saw a vision.
I saw a goddess.

204
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,431
Come on.
You gotta catch up to her.

205
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,724
I didn't see anything.
Come on, Curt.

206
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,017
We can't be
spending half the night

207
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,519
chasing girls down
for you.

208
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,856
Laurie, I'm telling you,
this was the most perfect,

209
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,024
dazzling creature
I've ever seen!

210
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,359
She's gone.
Forget it.

211
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,569
She spoke to me.

212
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,071
She spoke to me,
right through the window!

213
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,656
I think she said,
"I love you."

214
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,577
That means nothing
to you people?

215
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,871
You have no romance,
no soul?

216
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,460
Someone wants me.
Someone roaming
the streets wants me.

217
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,086
Will you turn the corner?

218
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,546
Oh, Curt.

219
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,049
Oh, oh.

220
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,844
Later.
Alligator.

221
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,734
Hey,
you're new around here.
Where you from?

222
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,777
Turlock.
Turlock?

223
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,237
You know a guy
named Frank Bartlett?

224
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,531
No. Does he go
to Turlock High?

225
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,159
Well, he used to.
He goes to JC now.

226
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,286
Do you go to JC?

227
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,746
Yeah, sure.

228
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,123
Oh, wow!
Do you know Guy Phillips?

229
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,501
Yeah, sure.
I got him in a class.

230
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,377
Oh, he's so boss.

231
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,255
How would you like
to ride around with me
for a while?

232
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,591
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm going steady.

233
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,053
Oh, come on!

234
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,222
I just can't.

235
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,098
You're just riding around
with a bunch of girls.

236
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,892
Hey, how about
somebody else in there?

237
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,603
Anybody else want
to go for a ride?

238
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,522
Look, you got
nothing to fear.

239
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,565
I'm as harmless
as a baby kitten.

240
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,025
I'll go, I'll go.

241
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,528
Judy's sister'll go
with you.
Is that all right?

242
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,531
Yeah. Sure.
Judy, her sister,

243
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,991
her mother, anybody.
I'll take them all.

244
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,577
Listen. We'll go up
and stop at that light.

245
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,038
It'll turn red by
the time we get there.

246
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,414
All right?

247
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,542
You ever get tired
of going steady

248
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,168
with somebody
that ain't around,

249
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,878
I'm up for grabs.

250
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,112
So, you're Judy's
little... Oh, shit.

251
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,530
How old are you?

252
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,864
Old enough.

253
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,032
How old are you?

254
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,117
I'm too old for you.

255
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,535
You can't be that old.
Listen, listen.

256
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,620
I think you better go back
and sit with your sister.

257
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,497
Hey, where are
they anyway?

258
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,999
Are they coming
back or something?

259
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,626
This is a joke, right?
This better be a joke,

260
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,961
'cause I'm not
driving you around.

261
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,754
But you asked me.

262
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,173
What's the matter?
Am I too ugly?

263
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,342
Judy doesn't
want me with her,

264
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,428
and now you don't
want me with you.

265
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,846
Nobody wants me.

266
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,557
Even my mother
and father hate me.

267
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,017
Everybody hates me.

268
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,602
No, they don't hate you.

269
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,562
You throw me out,
I'll scream.

270
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,647
Oh, no, no, no,
stay cool.

271
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,734
Everything's all right.
We'll find your sister.

272
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,277
Can't be too hard
to find.

273
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,447
John, you gonna
be there tonight?
Oh, shit.

274
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,032
Hey, get down.

275
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,161
Hey! Cool.

276
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,747
Hey, is this what they
call "copping a feel"?

277
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,583
What? No. Get up.
No. Jesus.

278
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,293
What's your name?

279
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,963
My name?
Mud, if anybody sees you.

280
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,507
Here come
old Buster Brown, man!

281
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,476
What've you got
in there, kid?

282
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,894
More than
you can handle.

283
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,924
Say, excuse me,
but I think we've
had an accident.

284
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,635
Well, God damn it,
I won't report you
this time, but next time,

285
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,553
just watch it,
will you?

286
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,785
Well, good evening.

287
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,870
Good evening.
How are you?
Yeah, hi.

288
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,206
This is really
a beautiful car,
you know that?

289
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,499
Of course
you know it.

290
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,376
You know what I'd
like to give you
for this car?

291
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,212
I'd like to
give you $1,000.

292
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,340
I can't give you that,
but I'm not gonna
give you a whole line.

293
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,801
I'm gonna tell you
what I can give you.
Come over here.

294
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,927
I'm not...

295
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,054
How would you like,
for $525, to be owner

296
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,723
of this
practically new 'vette?

297
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,266
Now, I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

298
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,270
I'm gonna knock 10%
right off the top.
How about that?

299
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,605
Now that's $98 down,
understand. $98 down.

300
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,732
I'm sorry, no.

301
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,444
$98 a month.
Now, you ask me,
"How can I do this?"

302
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,070
I'll tell you
how I can do it.

303
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,698
My boss, he wants
to get rid of
the sporty cars.

304
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:56,992
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

305
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,243
He wants to get rid
of the sporty cars.

306
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,745
I don't think
it's a good idea.

307
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,912
Listen. I want you
to listen to me.

308
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,038
No, I'm busy.

309
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,582
I've got some things
I've gotta do.

310
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,083
I'm gonna give you a deal
you can't say no to.

311
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,085
Leave me alone,
for God's sake!

312
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,467
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

313
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:27,999
Let's go!

314
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,734
Well, why are you
so depressed?

315
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,945
You'll forget him
in a week.

316
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,780
After you're
elected senior queen,

317
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,366
you'll have
so many boys
after your bod.

318
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,909
Peggy,
the whole point is

319
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,537
I do not want
to go out with
any other guys.

320
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,082
Laurie,
I know it's a drag,
but you can't just...

321
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,836
Look,
remember what happened
to Evelyn Chelnick?

322
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,380
When Mike went
into the Marines,

323
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,631
she had
a nervous breakdown,

324
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,926
and was acting so wacky,
she got run over by a bus.

325
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,096
I just wish I could go
with him or something.

326
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,515
Oh, Laurie, jeez!
Come on.

327
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,062
Hey, zit makeup!
Hey, come on...

328
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,147
Hey, everybody...

329
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,065
Just cool it,
huh, Steve?

330
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,445
Let me see some
of that stuff.

331
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,906
You leaving tomorrow?
Uh-huh.

332
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,866
You and Laurie
engaged yet?

333
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,784
No, but we got it
all worked out.

334
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,952
We're still gonna
be going together,

335
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,287
but we can date
other people.

336
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,623
And screw around.
I know.

337
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,416
Hey, I hear
college girls
really put out.

338
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,209
Cherry bomb!

339
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,330
Come on.

340
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,498
"Come on" what?

341
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,875
Let's dance.

342
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,710
No, thanks.

343
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,296
Laurie, I said
I wanna dance.

344
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,757
Well, Steven,
who's stopping you?

345
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,135
I thought since this is
our last night together
for three months,

346
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,595
you might wanna
dance with me.

347
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,972
How sentimental of you.

348
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,264
You'll be back
at Christmas.

349
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,058
I want to dance now,
not at Christmas.

350
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,810
Come on.
Get your cooties
off me.

351
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,153
Don't make a scene.

352
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,114
Go ahead. Slug me.
Scar my face!

353
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,700
I wouldn't dance with you
if you were the last guy
left in this gym.

354
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,451
This is getting good.

355
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,995
Come on, Eddie,
I'll dance with you.

356
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,122
You don't mind,
do you, Peggy?

357
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,835
Joe College
strikes out.

358
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:43,838
Curtis!

359
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,508
Curtis, come here.
Help me, will you?
I'm surrounded.

360
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,926
Come here.

361
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,594
You won't dance?
Come on.

362
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,304
No, really,
I'd like to,
but I can't.

363
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,847
If old Mr. Simpson
came in here

364
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,767
and saw me dancing with
one of you sexy little...
Excuse me.

365
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,478
One of you young ladies,
he'd have my rear end.

366
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,938
Okay? Thank you.

367
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,442
Hey, Warren.
Come on, gentlemen,
back inside.

368
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,111
Put it out.
Let's go.

369
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,362
Kids.

370
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,531
Want a cigarette?

371
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,866
All right.

372
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,911
I thought you'd left.

373
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:16,830
No, not yet.
I have no matches.

374
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,373
That's all right.

375
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,670
Brother,
how do I get stuck
with dance supervision?

376
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:24,879
Will you tell me that?

377
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,757
You going back east?

378
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,635
I remember
the day I went off.

379
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,887
Got drunk as hell
the night before. Just...

380
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,431
Blotto.
Blotto. Exactly.

381
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,767
Barfed on the train
all the next day, too.

382
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,894
Cute. Very cute.

383
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,355
Where'd you go again?

384
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,982
Middlebury, Vermont.
Right.

385
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,151
Yeah. Got a scholarship.
Only stayed a semester?

386
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,571
One semester,
after all that.
Came back here.

387
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,823
Yeah.
Why'd you come back?

388
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,742
Decided I wasn't
the competitive type.

389
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,120
I don't know.
Maybe I was scared.

390
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,329
Well,

391
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,167
I think I may
find that I'm not

392
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,044
the competitive
type myself.

393
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,337
What do you mean?

394
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,215
Well, I'm not
really sure
that I'm going.

395
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,843
Hey, now,
don't be stupid.

396
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:15,138
Experience life.
Have some fun, Curtis...
Bill?

397
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,766
Mr. Wolfe?

398
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,227
Can I speak
with you a minute?

399
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,688
Hi, Curt.

400
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,814
Jane.

401
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,610
Good luck, Curtis.

402
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,280
Yeah. I'll see you.
Okay.

403
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,115
Thanks a lot.

404
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:03,645
A Wolfman Jack exclusive!

405
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,189
The Beach Boys, baby!
A brand-new group!

406
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,524
I predict they
gonna go a long way.

407
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,027
This is called
Surfin' Safari.

408
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,126
So, the next night
we found out where
they were parked

409
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,753
and went out
with ammunition.

410
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,130
Don't you have
some homework
or something to do?

411
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,299
No sweat.
My mother does it.

412
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,927
Anyway,
he thought he was had.

413
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,179
He started the car
and couldn't see
through the windshield,

414
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,306
and zoomed straight
into the canal.

415
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,433
I still got some,
so don't try anything.

416
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,893
Hey, watch it,
will you?

417
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,436
Jesus Christ!

418
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,855
Thanks a lot.

419
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,944
Hey, driving is
a serious business.

420
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,989
I ain't having
no accidents
just because of you.

421
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,623
Come on.
Don't give me any grief.
I'm warning you.

422
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,417
Spare me, killer.

423
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,547
Oh, shit!

424
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,758
Why did you do that?

425
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,052
I don't like
that surfing shit.

426
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,306
Rock and roll's
been going downhill

427
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,765
ever since
Buddy Holly died.

428
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,226
Don't you think
the Beach Boys are boss?

429
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,728
You would,
you grungy little twerp.

430
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:27,979
Grungy!

431
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:32,191
You big weenie.
If I had a boyfriend,
he'd pound you.

432
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,068
Yeah, sure.

433
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,904
Ah, shit! Holstein!

434
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,823
Good. A cop.

435
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,325
I'm gonna tell him
you tried to rape me.

436
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,492
Oh, no, no, no.

437
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,661
It's past curfew,
I'm gonna tell him
how old I am,

438
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:46,331
my parents
don't know I'm out and
you tried to rape me.

439
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,498
Yeah, with shaving cream.

440
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,666
Boy, are you up a creek.

441
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:51,586
Come on.
Really, Carol,
don't say anything.

442
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,964
If you say,
"I was a dirty bird.

443
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,924
"Carol's not grungy.
She's bitching."

444
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,301
Oh.

445
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,720
Say it. I'll tell him.

446
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:09,020
I was a dirty bird.
Carol's not grungy.
She's bitching.

447
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:10,938
I'll think about it.

448
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,948
Where you going,
Milner?

449
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,784
Oh, I'm going home, sir.

450
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,660
Uh-huh.
Where've you been?

451
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,580
We were
at the movies, sir.

452
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,664
Milner,
you didn't happen

453
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,083
to be around
the corner of
12th and G

454
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,417
about 8:30 tonight,
did you?

455
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,337
No. No, sir.
We were at the movies,
like I said.

456
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,713
Uh-huh.

457
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,051
Milner, the reason
I stopped you was

458
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,136
because the light on
your license plate's out.

459
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,514
I'm gonna have to
cite you for that.

460
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,307
And, Milner,
the front end

461
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,435
of this thing
you're driving
looks a little low.

462
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,314
Oh, no, sir.
It's 12 and a half inches,
regulation size.

463
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,941
Now, it's been
checked several times.

464
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,651
You can check it
if you like, sir.

465
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,489
Look, Milner.

466
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,866
Listen.
You can't fool
with the law.

467
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:04,951
Yes, sir.

468
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,577
We know that
was you tonight.

469
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,496
We have an excellent
description of this car.

470
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,915
I could run you in
right now,

471
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,041
and I could
make it stick.

472
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:13,960
But I'm not gonna
do that, Milner.
You know why?

473
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,963
I want to catch you
in the act,

474
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,799
and when I do,
I'm gonna nail you
but good.

475
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,596
Happy birthday, Milner.

476
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,182
Thank you,

477
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,725
asshole.

478
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,769
You're a regular J. D.

479
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,856
File that under C.S.
Over there.

480
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,525
C. S?
What's that stand for?

481
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,777
Chicken shit.
That's what it is.

482
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,237
Hah.

483
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,689
Ain't he neat?

484
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,526
Hey, you know
a guy around here

485
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,570
with a piss
yellow deuce coupe?

486
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,447
Supposed to
be hot stuff?

487
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,157
What,
you mean John Milner?

488
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,035
Hey, nobody can
beat him, man.
He's got the fastest...

489
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,329
I ain't nobody, dork.

490
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,955
Right?
Right.

491
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,501
You see this Milner,
you tell him I'm looking
for him, huh?

492
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,795
Tell him I aim
to blow his ass
right off the road.

493
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,964
Ain't he neat?

494
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,774
What a babe.

495
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,943
What a bitching babe.

496
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,878
Hello.

497
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,967
Look, you sure
you don't need
a lift somewhere, huh?

498
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,553
Hey, you know
John Milner?

499
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,137
John Milner's
a good friend of mine.

500
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,307
Hey, did anybody
ever tell you

501
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,142
that you look just
like Connie Stevens?

502
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,687
You do.
I really mean it.
For real?

503
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,815
Yeah. I met her once
at a Dick Clark road show.

504
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,733
Yeah? You really
think I look like her?

505
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,901
Yeah, no shit.

506
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:48,155
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean that I'm not
just feeding you a line.

507
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,701
I really think you do.
You look like Connie Stevens.

508
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,828
What's your name?
Debbie.

509
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,831
You know, I always thought
I look like Sandra Dee.

510
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,418
Oh. Yeah, well,
you look a lot
like her, too.

511
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,336
Yeah, is this your car?

512
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,338
Yeah. I'm Terry the...

513
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,967
Well, they usually
call me Terry the Tiger.

514
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,386
Yeah? It's really
tough-looking.

515
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,096
What school you go to?

516
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,015
Dewey.
Can it lay rubber?

517
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,686
Yeah,
I got a 327 Chevy in it.
It's got six Strombergs.

518
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,438
That's bitching
tuck 'n' roll.

519
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,024
You know,
I really love the feel of
tuck 'n' roll upholstery.

520
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,067
You do? Well...
Yeah.

521
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,194
You know, come in.
I'll let you feel it.

522
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,363
I mean,
you can touch it
if you want.

523
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,325
I'll let you
feel the upholstery.

524
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,534
Okay.

525
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,550
Peel out.

526
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,844
What?
Peel out.

527
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,347
I just love it
when guys peel out.

528
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,398
And they came
all the way
from Stockton.

529
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,608
Let's hear it.

530
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,487
I don't care if you
leave this second.

531
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,198
And we wanna
thank Darby Langdon,

532
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,742
who did all these
neat decorations.

533
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,497
Now the next dance is
gonna be a snowball,

534
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,332
and leading it off
is last year's

535
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,459
class president,
Steve Bolander,

536
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,671
and this year's
head cheerleader,
Laurie Henderson.

537
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,895
Come on.
"Come on" what?

538
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,439
Oh, Steven, please.
Smile or something.

539
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,330
Quit pinching.

540
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,207
You think I care
if you go off?

541
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,042
You think I'm gonna
crack up or something?

542
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,168
Boy, are you conceited!

543
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,253
I don't know why
I ever asked you out

544
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,546
in the first place.

545
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,715
You didn't.
I asked you out.

546
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,341
What do you mean,
you asked me out?

547
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,218
Backwards Day.
Remember?

548
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,304
If I had waited
for you to ask me...
Oh, brother!

549
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,599
Even after that,
you didn't call me
for two weeks.

550
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,726
Well, I was busy.

551
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,977
You were scared.

552
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,770
Dave Ogler told me.

553
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,981
Then when you did
ask me out,

554
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,774
you didn't kiss me
for three dates.

555
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:29,900
Well, I was...

556
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,777
Scared.
Jim Kiler told me.

557
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,740
I even asked my father
why you hadn't kissed me.

558
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,491
Your father. Great.

559
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,034
You know what he said?

560
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,036
He said he thought
you were bright enough,

561
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,831
and that you'd probably
get around to it
after a while.

562
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,001
You didn't, of course.
I had to.

563
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,171
Remember the picnic?

564
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,923
Out at the canyon?

565
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,010
Oh, boy! You don't
remember anything,
do you?

566
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,471
The first one,
up at the lake.

567
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,599
That was the first time
you kissed me.

568
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,020
I had to practically
throw myself at you.

569
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,731
I remember.

570
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,219
What's wrong?

571
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,387
Go to hell.

572
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,688
What are you doing,
stealing hubcaps?

573
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,440
Well, hey, Wendy.

574
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,442
How've you been?

575
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,819
Fine.

576
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:56,987
Great.

577
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,532
How you been?
Wait a sec.

578
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,867
Wait a minute!

579
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,079
Bobbie Tucker.
She's got her car.

580
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,873
Heard you're
going away to school.

581
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,292
Maybe, maybe.

582
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,754
What?
Same old Curt.

583
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,006
All the time
we were going together,

584
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,883
you never knew
what you were doing.

585
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,302
Hey, guys,
wait for me!

586
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,596
Well, I gotta go.

587
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,890
Well, where you going?

588
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,058
Nowhere.

589
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,060
Well, you mind
if I come along?

590
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,938
Okay.

591
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:16,692
All right, Bolander,
break that up.
You know the rules.

592
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,654
You and your girlfriend
wanna do that,
go someplace else, huh?

593
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,657
Hey, Kroot.
Why don't you
go kiss a duck?

594
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,284
What did you say?

595
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,202
I said go kiss a duck,
marble-head.

596
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,914
All right, Bolander,
you are suspended!

597
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,918
Don't you even
come in Monday.
You're out! You're out!

598
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,210
Kroot, Kroot...

599
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,505
I graduated last semester.
Remember?

600
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,027
Why don't we go
out to the canal?

601
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,570
What for?

602
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,115
Listen, I can get
tough with you, too,
you know.

603
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,492
Hard guy.

604
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,138
A double Chubby Chuck,
a Mexicali Chili-Barb,

605
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,473
two orders of
French fries and...

606
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,599
Cherry Coke.

607
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:31,976
And two Cherry Cokes.

608
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,645
Now wait a minute.
What? Huh?

609
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,023
Yeah, right. Cool.

610
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,859
Hey, Deb.

611
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,277
How's my soft baby?

612
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,989
Come on. Beat it, Vic.
I'm not your baby.

613
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,784
Oh, come on, honey.
Look, so I never
called you back.

614
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,786
I've been,
you know, busy.

615
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,621
Yeah, three weeks?

616
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,790
Besides, it only took me
one night to realize

617
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,543
if brains were dynamite,
you couldn't blow your nose.

618
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,336
Look who's talking.

619
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,839
Hey, who's the wimp
you're hanging out
with now? Einstein?

620
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:05,050
Tiger happens to
be very intelligent,
unlike you.

621
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:09,596
I know everything
your dirty little mind
is thinking. It shows.

622
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,641
Hey, now, buddy, look.
The lady obviously
doesn't wanna have to...

623
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,019
Look, creep. You want
a knuckle sandwich?

624
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,688
No, thanks.
I'm waiting for
a double Chubby Chuck.

625
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,648
Then keep your
smart-ass mouth shut.

626
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,692
Hey, I'll call you
sometime, Deb.

627
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,861
Some night
when I'm hard up.

628
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,529
I won't be home.

629
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,159
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

630
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,287
You seem to know
a lot of weird guys.

631
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,999
That creep's not
a friend of mine.
He's just horny.

632
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,294
That's why I like you.
You're different.

633
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,464
I am? I mean,
you really think
I'm intelligent?

634
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:47,301
Yeah. And I bet
you're smart enough
to get us some brew.

635
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,305
Yeah.
Brew?

636
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,431
Yeah.

637
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,891
Liquor.

638
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,142
Yeah.

639
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,394
Yeah, right, liquor.

640
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,230
Yeah, this place is
too crowded anyway.

641
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,409
What about your
double Chubby Chuck,

642
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:13,994
your Mexicali
Chili-Barb

643
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,871
and your two
Cherry Cokes, sir?

644
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,250
Will you speed up,
please?

645
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,086
Quit shoving me.
You're gonna lose her.

646
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,670
Cut around him.

647
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,006
Just hang a right
at the corner.

648
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,634
Oh, lost her again.

649
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,219
Who is she?

650
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,180
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

651
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,767
I know who she is.

652
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,606
Well, come on, Bob.

653
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,734
Come on, who is she?

654
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,529
Come on!

655
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,366
You know Mr. Beeman?
He owns Hepcat Jewelers.

656
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,909
Yeah.

657
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,703
That's his wife.

658
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,831
Get out of here.

659
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,126
That's ridiculous.
That girl is young
and beautiful.

660
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,252
And married.

661
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,212
And she was
cruising 10th Street.

662
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,965
You got to be thinking
of someone else.

663
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,091
Hey, did you know

664
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,427
that my ex is
going to become
a presidential aide?

665
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,558
Yeah, and it's a secret,
so don't tell anybody.

666
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:22,062
But his greatest ambition
is to shake hands
with President Kennedy.

667
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,567
How do you suppose
you're gonna do that,
wishy-washy, at JC?

668
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:30,154
Well, maybe I've grown up.
Maybe I changed my mind.

669
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,238
I doubt it.
I doubt it.

670
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,990
Maybe you don't
think you can do it.

671
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,324
Maybe you ought
to shut up.

672
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,118
Maybe I ought to.
But I won't.

673
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,246
Maybe you ought
to come into
the aft chamber.

674
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,249
Where we can
discuss this in private.

675
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,380
Thanks a lot.

676
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,757
Come on, Wendy.

677
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,309
Move over.
I'm not sitting
on your lap.

678
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,646
To the opera, James.

679
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,481
Drop dead.

680
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,859
Unless you want to
go to Gallo Dam
and have a little orgy.

681
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,068
You wish.

682
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,737
Oh, I could pick up
some oleomargarine,

683
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,031
roll around in it
for a while.

684
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,631
Hey, you guys,
keep your mind
on the road.

685
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,309
I've been silly.

686
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:43,894
Oh, yeah?

687
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,355
I'm really glad
you're gonna stay.

688
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,736
We might even have
a class together.

689
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,240
- Maybe.
- Look.

690
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,616
There's Kip Pullman.

691
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,201
He's so neat.

692
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,204
Look. Say something
to him when we go by.

693
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:03,914
What do you
want me to say?

694
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,457
Anything.
I just want to meet him.

695
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,543
Hey, Kip, buddy.
What's up?

696
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,630
Hey, Henderson.
Long time no see.
What you been doing?

697
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,966
Nothing, nothing.

698
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:17,094
I just wanted to tell you
that Bobbie here's

699
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,805
madly in love with you
and trembles at the sight

700
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,348
of your rippling biceps.

701
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,105
Out of my car, you...

702
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,190
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

703
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,485
I hate you!
Get out of my car!

704
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,489
Temper, temper!

705
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,741
Bye, Curt.

706
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,397
Yes, found Barbara Ann.

707
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:16,820
Hey, this one is
for all you out there
watching the Submarine Races.

708
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,794
Here it is.
One 10-cent Coke with ice.

709
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:37,299
And don't take
all day drinking it.
Please.

710
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,886
Oh, rats. I thought
some of my friends
might be here.

711
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,597
Probably a couple of weeks
past their bedtime now.

712
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,391
Oh, wait.
There's Dee Dee.
I hope she sees me.

713
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,435
Shit. Dee Dee.

714
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,813
Hiya, John.
Oh.

715
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,483
What do
you say, Al?
Not much.

716
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,736
Say, do you think
if I brought my Mopar
by the shop on Monday,

717
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,112
you could spot weld
the bumper bracket?

718
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,364
Sure. Anything.

719
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,698
Just come by before noon.
All right?

720
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,784
Sure.
Hey, you met Linda?
Fine.

721
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,036
No, no. Hi, Linda.

722
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,247
This is my cousin, Carol.

723
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,500
Carol, Linda. Al.

724
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,419
I'm babysitting tonight.

725
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,670
Babysitting?

726
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,047
Yeah, Jesus!
Watch it, will you?

727
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,343
Been hitting me all night.
Kids will be kids, you know.

728
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:25,222
Hold on, God damn it.
Why don't you grow up,
for Christ's sake?

729
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,349
We don't
get along too well.

730
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,643
You know how it is.
It's been like this...

731
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,145
You spastic creep!

732
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,785
Hi, cousin.
How's your bod?

733
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,877
Wolfman Top 40 is
Box 1300, Chula Vista.

734
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:40,589
Wolfman sweatshirts
is Wolf Enterprises,
Bakersfield.

735
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,561
Hi.

736
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:55,979
Excuse me, sir.

737
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,230
Yes, son?

738
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:02,110
I was wondering,
could you give me
the time?

739
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,238
Oh, sure.
It's 11:45.

740
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:07,365
Yeah. 11:45. Good.
Thanks a lot.

741
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,533
Okay.

742
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,207
Oh, excuse me, sir.

743
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,669
I got a problem.
See, I lost my I. D.
In a flood

744
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,797
and I was wondering,
since you're going
in there anyway,

745
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,467
could you pick me
some Old Harper?
Hard stuff?

746
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,843
Would you
buy me a bottle?

747
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,220
Why, certainly.

748
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,889
I lost my wife, too.

749
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,851
Her name wasn't Idy, though,
and it wasn't in a flood.

750
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,186
But I know what you...

751
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,270
Yeah, good.

752
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,898
Here's...
Here's some money.
Old Harper.

753
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:41,900
Great.

754
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:49,908
Hi.
Hi.

755
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,660
11:45.
Right-o.

756
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:52,827
Yeah.

757
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,371
Good night.
Good night.

758
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,131
Hey, no.
Not wine. Hey.

759
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,322
Hi.
Hi.

760
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,534
Say, was there
an old man in here
a minute ago?

761
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,369
Yeah. Just went
out the back.

762
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,329
Want something?

763
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,543
Yeah.
Let me have...

764
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,795
Okay, yeah.
Let me have
a 3 Musketeers

765
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,922
and a ball-point pen,

766
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,175
one of those combs there,
a pint of Old Harper,

767
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,844
a couple of
flashlight batteries

768
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,554
and some beef jerky.

769
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:10,280
Okay. You got an I. D.
For the liquor?

770
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,698
Oh.

771
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,491
Yeah.

772
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,411
Oh, nuts.
I left it in the car.

773
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,580
Sorry. You'll have
to get it before...

774
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,706
Well, I...

775
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,709
I also...
I forgot the car.

776
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,471
Hey, did you get it?
You get it, you get it,
you get it?

777
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,556
You got it.
You got it.

778
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,727
You didn't get it.
Why didn't you get it?

779
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,145
Well, I...
I needed some things

780
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,856
and I thought,
as long as I was
in there...

781
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,651
Look, Debbie,
can you loan me a dollar?

782
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,864
Are you for real? Come on.
Girls don't pay. Guys pay.

783
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,785
Yeah. Well, see,
I've only got $50 and
he doesn't have change.

784
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,247
Wow. I can't
believe this.

785
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,583
I really
cannot believe this.

786
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,336
Here.

787
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,802
Hi, excuse me.
I'm wondering,
could you...

788
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,595
Buy you a bottle
of booze?

789
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,057
Yeah, I know.
You lost your I. D.
What kind do you want?

790
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,894
Gee, that's terrific.
Just some Old Harper.

791
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,400
Great.

792
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,398
That one over there,
that's Freddy Benson's
'vette.

793
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,775
Got his
in a head-on collision
with a drunk.

794
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,569
Boom!

795
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,197
Didn't have a chance.
He was a good driver, too.

796
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,242
It's pretty grim
when a guy gets it,

797
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,994
and it's not
even his own fault.

798
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,705
Needs a paint job,
that's for sure.

799
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,457
See that over there?
That '41?

800
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,750
That used to be,
believe it or not,

801
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,501
the fastest car
in the valley.

802
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,171
I never got a chance
to race Earl, though.

803
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:36,092
He got his in 1955 in
about the hairiest crash
we ever had here.

804
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,386
Jesus, you should
have seen it.

805
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,680
Eight kids killed
and both drivers.

806
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,183
The Board of Education
was real impressed,

807
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,976
see, so they come up,
film the whole thing.

808
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,854
Now they show it
in drivers'
education classes.

809
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,106
You'll probably see it
if you get lucky.

810
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:55,570
Course, it's pretty tough
when they take somebody
with them.

811
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,534
You never had
an accident, though.
You told me.

812
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,204
Yeah. Well,
I come mighty close.

813
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,164
I almost rolled it
a couple of times.

814
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,083
But I've been
just quick enough

815
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,710
to stay out
of this graveyard.

816
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,882
Bet you're the fastest.

817
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,719
I've never been beat.
A lot of guys tried.

818
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:24,641
Seems to me
there's more guys lately
than there's ever been.

819
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,315
Sneaking around
with the Wolfman, baby.

820
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,906
Oh, this gonna
strike a raw nerve, Mama.
Here's The Platters.

821
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,812
What're you doing,
creep?

822
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,898
Who, me?

823
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,112
No. I'm talking
to the other
50 creeps here.

824
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,951
You know
Gil Gonzales?

825
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,286
Gil Gonzales?

826
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,622
No. No, I don't.

827
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,957
You don't know Gil?

828
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,168
Well, you ought to.
He's a friend of ours,

829
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,504
and that's his car
you've got your
butt parked on.

830
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,471
Hey, where are
you going?

831
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,765
Nowhere.
Well, you must be
going someplace.

832
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,475
I mean,
you left here,
didn't you?

833
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,687
Ants, bring him over here.
I want to show him something.

834
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,732
Here.

835
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,152
Bend down here.
Look across here.
You see?

836
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,864
Right across here.
You see?

837
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,074
Yeah?
Yeah, I guess so.

838
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,993
You scratched it, man.

839
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,829
Now, where do you get off
sitting on Gil's car?
Huh, man?

840
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:13,041
I'm sorry. It's really
not much of a scratch.

841
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,250
I don't think
you'd see it...

842
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,753
It ain't the size
that's in question here.

843
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:19,380
It's the principle.
The principle. Right.

844
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,841
Oh, jeez,
this is gonna be tough.

845
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:28,306
What should we
do with you?

846
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,683
Tie him to the car
and drag him.

847
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:41,027
You know Toby Juarez?

848
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,697
Toby Juarez,
he's a Pharaoh,
isn't he?

849
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,283
Toby Juarez?

850
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,410
Yeah, we know Toby.

851
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,538
We killed him
last night.

852
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,791
Tied him to the car
and...

853
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,000
Dragged him.

854
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:57,210
Right.

855
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,300
This is gonna
take some thinking.

856
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,309
You better come
with us, maybe.

857
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:14,686
Take a ride with
the Pharaohs. Huh?

858
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,605
No. Listen.
I'd really like to,
but I... I've got to...

859
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,484
I'd rather...
I'd rather...

860
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,194
I know
just how you feel.

861
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,029
Shotgun.

862
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,322
No, I called it.

863
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:27,448
When?

864
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:28,950
Before we picked you up.

865
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,827
Man, you can't call it
for the whole night.

866
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,829
I got it now.
Get in the back, punk.

867
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,083
Will you get in there?
Jesus!

868
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:26,049
Rock and roll
will stand, man.

869
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,885
Who is this on
the Wolfman telephone?

870
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,053
Hello, it's collect.

871
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,220
Pardon me.
Your name is Collett?

872
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,014
Yes.
Collect call for Wolf...

873
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,557
Your name
is Collett Call?

874
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,892
Sir, this is
the operator.

875
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,226
Are you French,
operator?

876
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,146
This is a collect call
for Wolfman Jack.

877
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,231
I... I love you,
operator.

878
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,691
Is this Wolfman Jack?

879
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,193
Is Floyd there?

880
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,153
It's for Wolfman Jack.

881
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,572
I just love
listening to Wolfman.

882
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,199
My mom won't
let me at home.

883
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,827
Because he's a negro.
I think he's terrific.

884
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,204
Do you know that
he just broadcasts

885
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,164
from a plane that
flies around in circles

886
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,290
all the time?

887
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,833
Do you believe
that's true?

888
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,336
Floyd,
I love you, Floyd.

889
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:06,047
Floyd,
is this you, Floyd?

890
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,425
Floyd,
I cannot look on thee,
love took my hand

891
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:13,679
and smiling did reply,
who made the eyes but I?

892
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,933
Floyd, reach out,
touch my soul, Floyd.

893
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,143
Your
party's ready, sir.
Hello, Floyd!

894
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:20,895
Matilda?
Bye!

895
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,523
You tell her, Wolfman.
He's my man.

896
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,817
When I graduate,
I'm gonna be a Wolfman.

897
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,985
Hey, you know,
he broadcasts out
of Mexico someplace?

898
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,322
No, he don't.
I've seen the station
right outside of town.

899
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:36,035
That's just
a clearing station, man,
so he can fool the cops.

900
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,246
He blasts that thing
all the way around
the world.

901
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,664
It's against
the law, man.

902
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:41,791
Oh, man, they'll never
catch Wolfman.

903
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,042
No way.

904
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:49,257
Hey, man,
who cut the cheese?

905
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,552
He who smelt it,
dealt it.

906
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,597
There's that
badass Chevy again.

907
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,642
Oh, look at that snatch
he's got with him.

908
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:01,644
Man, he looks
like a wimp.

909
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,230
Probably is.
Wimps get all the snatch.

910
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,947
Milner ain't
gonna beat that.
His time has come.

911
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:16,701
He's getting old.
He ain't as fast
as he used to be.

912
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,456
You got just two seconds
to get your ass over
in your corner.

913
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,418
Don't worry,
I won't rape you.

914
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,752
Hey.

915
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,297
You got a bitching car.

916
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,840
Yeah, I know.

917
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,301
In fact,
your car's so neat,

918
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,928
we're gonna give
you our special prize.

919
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,889
You want me
to give it to you?

920
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:41,184
Sweetheart,
if the prize is you,
I'm a ready teddy.

921
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,352
Well, get bent, turkey.

922
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,194
Very funny.
What a chop.

923
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,821
Quit laughing.

924
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,031
Let's catch them
at the light,

925
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,490
then you jump out
and flatten their tires.

926
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:57,992
Wait a minute.
Just do what I say.

927
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,244
All right, boss.

928
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,391
Wow, it's a really
beautiful night tonight.

929
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,353
It's a perfect night
for horseback riding.

930
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,315
I was going with a guy
who had horses once.

931
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,401
Oh, yeah?
I had a couple
of horses myself.

932
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,736
Really?
Mmm.

933
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,698
I used them for hunting.
I do a lot of hunting,
you know.

934
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:04,368
Yeah. Deer, mostly.
Got a couple of
bear last year.

935
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,329
Yeah, those were
good ponies.

936
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,497
Had to train
them special myself.
Took a lot of time.

937
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:11,500
Yeah?
Do you still have them?
We can go for a ride.

938
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,170
No. No.
I had to sell them

939
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,005
to get these wheels.
And a Jeep.

940
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,883
I got a Jeep pickup
with four-wheel drive.

941
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,260
It's got a gun rack on it,
and I use that
for hunting mostly.

942
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,680
Why do you kill
little animals?
I think that's terrible.

943
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,307
Oh, well, yeah,

944
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:30,478
I figure with bears,
though, it's me or them.

945
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,648
You know, I think
you're really neat.

946
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,025
Wait a second.

947
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,611
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

948
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,365
I don't know, I guess,
maybe it's the booze
or something.

949
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,741
I don't know.

950
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,130
Ouch!
You pinched me!
I'm sorry.

951
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:01,634
Let me get
my head over here.
Okay, you get up.

952
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,052
Okay.

953
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,596
This is...
Ow! My leg, my leg.
Ow! Watch it!

954
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:14,730
Mmm. I just love
tuck 'n' roll upholstery.

955
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,860
Jeez. It's like
Grand Central Station
around here.

956
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,029
Why don't we go
someplace else?

957
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:23,614
No, come on.
They won't come back.

958
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,658
Wait a minute.

959
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:27,243
I got a blanket
in the back.

960
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,078
Why don't we go over
into the field?

961
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,247
All right.
Okay. Okay.

962
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:33,624
Oh.

963
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,000
- Hello.
- Yeah.

964
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,168
How old are you?

965
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,671
I'm 13,
how old are you?

966
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,423
I'm only 14.

967
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,842
Oh, boy,
I love you, Wolfman.

968
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,221
Now we gonna
do the weather

969
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,640
for all the valleys
and the mountain tops.

970
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:54,770
Gonna be hot.
About 200 degrees in Merced,
400 degrees out in Fresno,

971
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:57,064
and I know
we're gonna have
about 500 degrees

972
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:58,858
up around the valley
there somewhere.

973
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,402
You got
The Wolfman Jack Show.

974
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,379
Hey, now, this is terrific.
See, I love miniature golf.

975
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:22,089
Is that right?

976
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,091
I hate it.

977
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:28,012
Well, I don't play
it too often anyway.
What are we doing here?

978
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,722
We're out of gas, man.

979
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,017
They don't...
They don't sell gas here.

980
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,228
I know.
But we're out
of money, too.

981
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:51,160
Ha!

982
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,044
Hey! Hey. What are
you punks doing?

983
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:01,212
What's going on here?

984
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,547
Why, just...

985
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:07,468
Hey, hi, Mr. Gordon.
What's up?

986
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,179
Henderson?

987
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,724
Curt Henderson,
are you with
these punks?

988
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,893
These are just
some friends of mine.

989
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:16,977
Oh, yeah?

990
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,687
Yeah. We're just,
you know...

991
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,105
Oh.

992
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:23,609
Well, you had me
nervous there
for a second, huh?

993
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,653
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah.

994
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,489
Well, you didn't
leave yet, huh?

995
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,952
Oh, no, I'm not...

996
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,164
I'm not scheduled
to leave until
tomorrow morning.

997
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:38,707
Tomorrow? Oh.

998
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,919
Hey, Hank Anderson's inside.
Come on in and say goodbye.
Huh?

999
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,712
You know,
he brought your name up
at the Moose Hall.

1000
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:44,797
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1001
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:45,923
You got the check,
didn't you?
Uh-huh.

1002
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:55,182
Hey, Hank,
look who's here.

1003
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,518
Well, well.
Well, well, well.

1004
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:02,022
Well, well,
how are you, Curt?
What a pleasant surprise.

1005
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:06,402
Congratulations, my boy.
We're all proud of you.
All of us.

1006
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:11,156
You know,
the Moose Scholarship
went to the right boy. You.

1007
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,575
And we're all
proud of you.

1008
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,701
Hey.

1009
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,704
We're all done out here.

1010
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,789
All done?
What's he mean?

1011
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:23,085
He means
we're all done having
loads of fun out here.

1012
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,461
Oh, well...
Wonderful.

1013
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:25,921
Yes.
You can have all
the fun you want.

1014
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:27,089
This place is for fun.

1015
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,299
Yes, it is.

1016
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,426
Thank you.
Thank you both.

1017
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,635
Good luck now.

1018
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,096
Curt,
before I say goodbye,

1019
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,974
I hope you'll be
taking along with you

1020
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,184
a little piece
of this place.

1021
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,103
I think I have.

1022
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,230
Good.
Don't forget us.

1023
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:45,983
No, I won't forget you
and you won't forget me.

1024
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,151
Okay. Bye-bye.
Okay.

1025
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,527
Goodbye
and good luck.
Bye now.

1026
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:49,737
Bye.
Bye.

1027
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,238
It was nice
to meet you.

1028
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,449
Right. What he said
goes for me, too.

1029
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,458
Yeah, you just
might make it as
a Pharaoh yet, boy.

1030
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,628
Someday he'll
make a fine Moose.

1031
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:09,590
What's the matter?

1032
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,926
The radio's gone.

1033
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:14,219
Yeah?

1034
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,723
That means
the car is gone!
Come on.

1035
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:35,199
Oh, God!
Not the car!

1036
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:39,745
Oh, no! Anything!
Not the car!

1037
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,521
You know,
it doesn't make sense

1038
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,523
to leave home
to look for home.

1039
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,443
To give up a life
to find a new life.

1040
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:16,073
To say goodbye
to friends you love
just to find new friends.

1041
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,158
Wait a minute.
Could you say
that again?

1042
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,785
Something Curt said.

1043
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,454
Mmm. Figures.

1044
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,999
You must've talked
his ear off trying
to get him to stay.

1045
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:29,753
Oh, no, Steven.
That's not true at all.
I didn't say anything.

1046
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,673
Curt just said
at dinner tonight

1047
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,092
that he didn't see
what the big hurry was.

1048
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:39,096
He thought that he ought
to stick around and go
to JC for a while,

1049
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,266
and try and figure out
what he wanted to
do with his life.

1050
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,893
That sounds logical.

1051
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,937
Do you think so?
Sure.

1052
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,690
I think Curt's
probably right,
for Curt.

1053
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,317
Not for me though.

1054
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,822
Laurie, look at me.

1055
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,080
Now, you know what
I want out of life,

1056
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,665
and it's just not
in this town.

1057
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,715
I'm not going with you
to the airport tomorrow.

1058
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:25,434
No, Steven, don't.

1059
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,602
Come on.

1060
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:28,103
No.

1061
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:29,688
It's our
last night together
for three months.

1062
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:31,690
I know.
But we've been
through this before.

1063
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,650
I'm gonna
miss you so much.

1064
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:34,943
I need something
to remember you by.

1065
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,529
You don't want me to
forget you, do you?

1066
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,031
No.

1067
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:54,671
Well, what's wrong?
You're just sitting there.

1068
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:55,964
Well, you want to.
Go ahead.

1069
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,216
Not like that.

1070
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,092
If you're not
gonna remember me
for anything else,

1071
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:00,511
why don't you
just go ahead?

1072
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:03,096
Oh, come on,
you want it
and you know it.

1073
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,140
Don't be so damn
self-righteous with me,

1074
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:08,143
after all that
stuff you told me about
watching your brother.

1075
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:11,230
You're disgusting.
Get out of my car.
Get out!

1076
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:14,191
Laurie.
I told you never
to mention that.

1077
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:21,990
So, anyhows,
the Goat Killer...

1078
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,116
Can't we talk
about something else?

1079
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,701
No.
Whenever he strikes,

1080
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,246
he leaves
a bloody goat's head
next to the victim.

1081
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,914
Isn't that creepy?

1082
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,292
They thought he
went up to Stockton,
but two nights ago

1083
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:36,296
they found the bodies
of Carlie Johnson
and Don White

1084
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:39,299
right here at this canal,
all hacked to pieces.

1085
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:42,219
Who do you think
will take the regionals
this year?

1086
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:45,138
Not only were there
bloody goats' heads
all around,

1087
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,808
but he had, like,
switched parts
of their bodies.

1088
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:52,354
She had on his arms
and he had
on her legs and...

1089
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,399
Wait a second!
Wait a second!

1090
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,694
Did you hear that?

1091
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,237
Do you think it's
the Goat Killer?

1092
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,446
No!

1093
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,657
I mean, no.

1094
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,909
Listen,
I'll go for help
and you stay here.

1095
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:08,120
No, let's get
in this field.

1096
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,164
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

1097
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:17,546
Maybe if it's
the Goat Killer,

1098
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,590
he'll get somebody
and we'll see
the whole thing.

1099
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,300
I don't want to
see the whole thing!

1100
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:24,469
I gotta see what
he's doing though.

1101
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,055
Darn it,
I wish I could see.

1102
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,975
I can't see anything.
I don't wanna
see anything.

1103
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,478
Just keep him
away from me.
That's all I want.

1104
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,814
How do I get
into these things?

1105
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,566
We're all right up...

1106
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:44,406
Debbie?

1107
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:56,126
Debbie?

1108
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:58,754
Oh, no!
Please! Please!

1109
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,005
Terry.

1110
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,840
Steve!
What are you
doing up here?

1111
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:03,926
Steve.
Oh, God, Steve.

1112
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,886
Hey,
is it safe to come out?

1113
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,096
Where did you go,
anyway?
Over there.

1114
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:09,932
Don't do that. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1115
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:11,391
Where's my rod?

1116
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,018
- Your rod?
- Yeah.

1117
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,103
Oh.
Did I introduce you?
This is Debbie.

1118
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,313
- Debbie, this is Steve.
- Hello.

1119
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,481
- Hi.
- Hi.

1120
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:18,774
Well?

1121
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,277
It's in the garage.

1122
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,780
I put it in the garage
for safekeeping.
I mean...

1123
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,490
I mean,
I don't want to take
any chances with it.

1124
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:27,616
Yeah.
Oh, great.

1125
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,951
Yeah.
It's a good thing, too,

1126
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,453
because somebody
stole our car.

1127
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:32,621
Really?
That's terrible.
Yeah.

1128
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:33,705
What kind was it?

1129
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,457
Gee,
where's Laurie anyway?

1130
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,708
I guess
we broke up.

1131
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,293
You broke up? Bull.

1132
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:45,634
Doesn't look like
a gearshift knob.
What is it?

1133
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:46,885
Come on, will you?
Give it back to me.

1134
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,971
What's wrong?
You're a tough guy.

1135
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:53,183
Go ahead and cream me.
Break my arm.
See if I care.

1136
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,566
I was just gonna keep it
for a little while.

1137
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,902
You're an ogre,
just like my father.

1138
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,531
He won't let me
stay out late or
play records or anything.

1139
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,492
Your father won't
let you stay out late?

1140
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,327
No, he's terrible.

1141
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,955
Once I was at a party and
it didn't end until late.

1142
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,707
He called the cops.

1143
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:20,168
Can you imagine?
He had the whole
police force there.

1144
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,922
By the way, where is it
that you live, Carol?

1145
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,425
Over on Ramona. Why?

1146
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,093
Oh, no!

1147
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:29,511
Uh-uh.

1148
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:34,182
You thought I'd
tell you where I live?
Not me. Not old Carol.

1149
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:35,267
The night is young,

1150
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,561
and I'm not hitting the rack
till I get a little action.

1151
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:41,189
What do you
keep looking at?

1152
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,358
Who's that?
You know him?

1153
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,360
He's following
awful close.

1154
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,029
Grab on to something.

1155
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,625
Hey, man, I'm sorry
if I scared you.

1156
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,545
You'd have to do
a hell of a lot more
than that to scare me.

1157
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,464
Hey, I've been looking
all over for you, man.

1158
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,716
Didn't nobody tell you
I was looking for you?

1159
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,509
Hey, I can't keep track
of all you punks

1160
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,553
running around here
backwards.

1161
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,889
Hey, you're supposed to
be the fastest thing
in the valley, man.

1162
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:16,933
But that can't be your car.
It must be your mama's car.

1163
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:19,895
I'm sort of embarrassed
to be this close to you.

1164
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,731
Well, I'm not surprised,
driving a field car.

1165
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,775
Field car?
What's a field car?

1166
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,359
A field car runs
through the fields,

1167
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:29,571
drops cow shit
all over the place
to make the lettuce grow.

1168
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:30,739
That's pretty good.

1169
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:34,034
Hey, I like the color
of your car there, man.
What's that supposed to be?

1170
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:37,287
Sort of a cross
between piss yellow
and puke green, ain't it?

1171
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,082
You call that a paint job,
but it's pretty ugly.

1172
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,084
I'll bet you got to
sneak up on the pumps

1173
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:44,336
just to get
a little air
in your tires.

1174
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,254
At least I don't have
to pull over to the side

1175
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,090
just to let
a funeral go by, man.

1176
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,592
Oh! Funny.
You know what?

1177
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,761
Your car's uglier
than I am!

1178
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:55,222
That didn't
come out right.

1179
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,561
Come on, boy.
Let's go. Prove it.

1180
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,980
Why don't you go out
and try to win yourself
a few races?

1181
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,775
Then you come on back
and I'll show you
a few things.

1182
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,569
Oh, race him.
You can beat him.

1183
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:11,780
Hey,
that's a tough-looking girl
you got with you, man.

1184
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,198
What are you doing?
Trying to pick up

1185
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,200
a few extra bucks
babysitting?

1186
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,660
Hey, doll,
why don't you come on

1187
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:19,204
and ride with me,
in about 10 years?

1188
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,497
Now, leave her
out of this.

1189
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:21,623
This is just
between you and me.

1190
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,686
Wow. He's really fast,
isn't he?

1191
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,688
Yeah, but he's stupid.

1192
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:50,152
Any of you guys
know a blonde
in a white T-Bird?

1193
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,320
I know her.
What about it?

1194
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:55,157
I'm trying to find out,
you know, who she is.

1195
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,826
She's out of
your price range, man.

1196
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,703
My brother's
been out with her.
He clued me in...

1197
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:01,204
Price range?

1198
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,125
Are you trying
to tell me
that she's a prost...

1199
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,836
That's right,
she's a $30 Sheri.

1200
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,297
Jesus. Can you imagine that?
Thirty bucks for that broad.

1201
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,174
We got to
be thinking about
two different broads.

1202
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,842
Hey, watch it.
Fuzz ahead.

1203
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,177
Where?

1204
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:16,511
At Jerry's Cherry.

1205
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:18,680
You can just
barely see the fender.

1206
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,099
Yeah.
We ought to
do something.

1207
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:23,268
I got an idea.

1208
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,688
I got a good idea.

1209
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:30,108
I think I'm gonna go
over to Burger City.

1210
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:32,777
Yeah. Yeah, Laurie's
probably over there.

1211
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,362
You really think
she's got me worried

1212
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:35,530
about where she is,
don't you?

1213
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:38,658
Well,
let me tell you something.
I couldn't care less.

1214
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,202
Want to come along?
Yeah, I do.
I do. I do.

1215
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,287
No.
Well, make up
your minds.

1216
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,332
No, thanks. We got to
report the car missing.

1217
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,042
All right.
I'll see you.

1218
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:48,585
Yeah. See you.

1219
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:53,506
Shut up!
They'll hear us.

1220
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:58,762
Listen, Carl...

1221
01:15:58,846 --> 01:15:59,930
Curt.

1222
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:01,431
Curt.
Curt.

1223
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:04,809
Despite you scratching
Gil's car, I like you.

1224
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:08,521
And I know what
you'd like more
than anything right now.

1225
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:10,065
Like every guy
in this town,

1226
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:12,442
you got the same
secret dream, right?

1227
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,903
You wanna be
a Pharaoh, huh.

1228
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,196
Go ahead.
You can admit it.

1229
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,741
But you didn't think
it was possible,
did you? Huh?

1230
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,578
Well, tonight,

1231
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,832
I'm gonna give
you your chance.

1232
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,731
Get down.

1233
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:55,110
Okay.
Now, you got it?

1234
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,611
I'm staying here.
You're on your own.

1235
01:16:56,696 --> 01:16:59,364
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Joe.
Wait a minute.

1236
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,448
What if he hears me?

1237
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,117
Listen, listen!

1238
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:06,288
Look at it this way.
Now, you got
three choices.

1239
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,832
One, you chicken out.

1240
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:10,333
In that case,
I let Ants tie you
to the car

1241
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:11,459
and drag you
around a bit.

1242
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,378
And you don't
want that, right?
No.

1243
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:17,507
Two, you foul up
and Holstein
hears you, and, well,

1244
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:18,883
you don't
want that, right?

1245
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,218
No, I don't.

1246
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:25,307
Three, you are successful
and you join the Pharaohs

1247
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:28,768
with a car coat and
a blood initiation
and all that, huh.

1248
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:32,063
What? Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What blood initiation?

1249
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,131
Hey, why don't we
go get your Jeep?

1250
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:23,049
What? What are
you talking about?

1251
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:24,217
You know, your Jeep.

1252
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:26,428
The one you sold
the hunting ponies for,

1253
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,805
the one with
the four-wheel drive.

1254
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,394
Hey, you sure
you got enough slack?

1255
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,813
Yeah, yeah, no sweat.
Let's get out of here.

1256
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,654
Come on, Terry.

1257
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,115
Terry?

1258
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:49,784
Stand by for justice!

1259
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:07,969
I can't believe it.

1260
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,222
Feeling so good
'cause you're 16.

1261
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:31,701
Why are we
stopping here?

1262
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:34,370
Carol.

1263
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:35,497
What?

1264
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:37,916
I...

1265
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:43,213
I don't think that
I can control myself
any longer tonight.

1266
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,006
You can't?
No.

1267
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,758
I've got to have you.

1268
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:48,426
Me?
Yeah.

1269
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:52,138
All night you've
been sitting there,
and you've been so sexy,

1270
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:54,933
and it's been
so hot out here,

1271
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,561
and I can't
wait any longer.
You've been so...

1272
01:20:58,646 --> 01:21:00,563
Well, a lot of that
was an act, you know.

1273
01:21:00,648 --> 01:21:02,857
Like my crying.
It was just an act.

1274
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:06,611
Yeah? It's been
building up inside of me
like a volcano all night.

1275
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,405
And if you told me
where you lived,

1276
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,157
well, then I could
take you home,

1277
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:14,410
but you won't tell me
where you live,
so here we are.

1278
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:18,206
I mean,
I've got to have you.
It's too late.

1279
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,958
It's not too late!
It's never too late!

1280
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,378
231 Ramona.
Two-three-one.
Two-three-one.

1281
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,963
I'll show you.
It's easy to find.

1282
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:36,558
Hi, Steve.
Mind if I sit down?

1283
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:38,726
Oh, hi. No.
Have a seat.

1284
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:43,606
Just got five minutes off
and I saw you here
all alone, for once.

1285
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:46,234
Where's Laurie?

1286
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,485
I don't know.

1287
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:49,237
I thought you guys
would be together,
I mean,

1288
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,947
this being
your last night
and everything...

1289
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:52,323
We broke up.
What?

1290
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:54,492
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal at all.

1291
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:56,160
Why? What happened?

1292
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,454
Budda,
you got an hour left.
Let's get on it.

1293
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,207
All right, all right,
you old fart! Relax!

1294
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,962
Hey, listen,
I'm gonna get off
in an hour,

1295
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,923
and I thought
you'd maybe like
to come over.

1296
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:13,595
I don't know.

1297
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:14,846
Well, why not?

1298
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:35,033
...this time,
it'd just be for fun.

1299
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:37,535
Okay?

1300
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,372
Well...

1301
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,625
Okay. I'll see
you later, then.

1302
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,337
Budda. Budda, wait.

1303
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:48,630
Yeah?

1304
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,673
Listen, I...

1305
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,675
I gotta get up early
in the morning

1306
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,637
and I just don't
think it'd work out.

1307
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,693
What a glorious night, huh?

1308
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:14,030
That was the bitching-est
thing I ever seen
in my whole life.

1309
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,740
Whoo!

1310
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,327
Boy, I'll tell
you something,

1311
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,037
that thing jumped about
five feet in the air...

1312
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,163
Listen, I still got
some things to do.

1313
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:23,247
I got to find
that blonde.

1314
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,793
Yeah, anyway,
catch you tomorrow night.

1315
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,337
I guess so.
I don't know.

1316
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,172
What do you mean,
you guess so?

1317
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,800
Listen, we don't
admit a lot of guys
to the Pharaohs.

1318
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,009
Right.
I mean,
you understand?

1319
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:37,345
We got to
steal you a car coat
and things like that.

1320
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:39,263
You got to
make up your mind.

1321
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,059
Rome wasn't
burned in a night.

1322
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,065
Well, let's go!
I'll see you, boys.

1323
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:50,358
Yeah.

1324
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:17,343
My, my, my.

1325
01:24:17,428 --> 01:24:19,220
You only got about
five minutes left

1326
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,013
if you want to
talk to the Wolfman.

1327
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:24,767
Gonna make all your dreams
come true, baby. Hello!

1328
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:25,977
- Wolfman.
- Yeah.

1329
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,270
Would you
dedicate a record

1330
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:29,063
to keep me and
my girlfriend together?

1331
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:30,148
Are you separated?

1332
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,899
Well, see, we're
having a little problem.

1333
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,735
I'll bring you
right together.
Hold on a minute, man.

1334
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:41,033
Everything's gonna
be all right now, man.
You understand?

1335
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,952
I chased
the evil spirits away.

1336
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,746
Now let me play
the record for you.

1337
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:51,020
Hey, hey, hey, baby.
What do you say?

1338
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:57,235
Don't say anything
and we'll get along
just fine.

1339
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,913
Well, this is the first time
you've been quiet all night.

1340
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,624
I had fun. Goodbye.

1341
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:13,918
Bye.

1342
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:17,421
Do you like me?

1343
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,924
Yeah, I like you.
You're all right.

1344
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:21,926
But I mean,
do you like me?

1345
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,428
Yeah...

1346
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:27,557
I like you.

1347
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:33,437
Okay?

1348
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,692
Couldn't I have something
to remember you by?

1349
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,167
Bye, kid.

1350
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:56,419
Gee, thanks!

1351
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,045
It's just like
a ring or something.
Yeah.

1352
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,881
It's like we
were going steady.

1353
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,299
Wait till I tell Marcia.

1354
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:02,592
Wait a minute, now.
Wait till
I tell everybody!

1355
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:03,676
Don't go overboard
with this thing.

1356
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,137
Well, I'll see you around.

1357
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:21,694
I've been crying so much.

1358
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:23,529
And the tears
and everything, man.

1359
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:26,991
I leaned down
towards the microphone,
I almost shorted myself out.

1360
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:29,660
Hold that up.

1361
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,787
You're right
about that.

1362
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:35,499
But why should
I leave home
to find a home?

1363
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,710
You know, why should
I leave friends

1364
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:38,794
that I love to
find new friends?

1365
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:39,921
Wait a minute,
wait a minute,

1366
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:42,006
wait a minute,
wait a minute.
I've heard this already.

1367
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,426
Aren't you the one
that told me
for eight weeks

1368
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,386
that you have to
leave the nest sometime?

1369
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:49,472
I realize that.
I realize that.

1370
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:52,475
No. No realizing.
You've been
telling me all summer

1371
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:56,020
that it's time to
stick your head
out of the sand

1372
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:59,857
and take a look at
the big, beautiful world
out there somewhere.

1373
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:01,150
But...
Give me this thing.

1374
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,069
I don't know, I...
I feel like a midwife.

1375
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:05,071
I may have been wrong, Curt.
I may have been wrong.

1376
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:07,740
Wrong, nothing.
You've been telling me
for eight weeks.

1377
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,367
God damn it.
Yeah, I know.

1378
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:12,036
You're just mentally
playing with yourself.

1379
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,331
Just relax and
we'll talk about it
at the airport.

1380
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:20,461
Where are you going?
It's awfully early
in the morning.

1381
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:22,546
I have
a dental appointment.

1382
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:23,714
Come on, Curt.

1383
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:27,009
Just relax, will you?
I'll see you
at the airport.

1384
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,345
He mustn't have
been used to drinking.

1385
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:14,015
No. He likes to drink.
He told me so.

1386
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:20,438
I knew a man once
who got that sick.

1387
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:23,691
Billy Weber.
That was 10 years ago.

1388
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,444
Being on his hands
and knees like that,

1389
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,653
he looks like a dog,
doesn't he?

1390
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:29,113
He looks
like Old Ginger.

1391
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,699
Sicker than a dog,
that's for sure.

1392
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:38,664
Are you all right?

1393
01:29:38,749 --> 01:29:40,332
Oh, rats.

1394
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:43,961
Oh, I feel terrible.

1395
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:50,885
The car!
Debbie, look!

1396
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,094
What?

1397
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,722
Debbie,
that's the car!

1398
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,974
Hey, look,
it's sitting right here.

1399
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,270
Are you sure
this is it?

1400
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,522
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
This is it. This is it.

1401
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,070
They must've taken
the keys with them.

1402
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,030
Well, maybe we better
go call the police.

1403
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,156
No. No. Wait a minute.

1404
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,451
I got a better idea.
We'll just steal it
right back, all right?

1405
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,328
Now, you get some wire.
We need about a foot.

1406
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:19,455
We can hotwire it.
Okay?

1407
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:40,392
Took the
header plugs off, eh?
Expecting some action?

1408
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:43,479
Yeah, I think so.
There's some punk
looking for me.

1409
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:44,897
Why in the hell
do they bother?

1410
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:46,732
You've been number one
as long as I can remember.

1411
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:47,900
Yeah.

1412
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:52,780
Been a long time,
ain't it?

1413
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,073
I'll see you. Thanks.

1414
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:07,253
Who is this on
the Wolfman telephone?

1415
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,635
Hi, this is my car.

1416
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:19,306
What I mean is,
somebody stole my...

1417
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,308
No, I mean,
I lost my car, see?

1418
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:25,604
And I want to
thank you two guys
for finding it.

1419
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:28,524
I mean, listen.
Now, listen, guys.

1420
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,651
I've been sick recently,
and this kind of activity

1421
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,278
can really be
hard on a guy.

1422
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:34,697
Now, easy, would you?
Easy. Easy.

1423
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,578
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

1424
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:45,040
Help! Help! Police!

1425
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,585
Stop! Stop it,
you creeps!

1426
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,837
Come on. No.

1427
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:54,967
Stop! Hey!

1428
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:56,093
Stop it!

1429
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:07,938
Go, John!

1430
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:09,023
Get him!

1431
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:14,778
Come on, get up!
Come on!

1432
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,576
What the hell's
going on here, Toad?

1433
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:22,411
Hey, man,
are you all right?

1434
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:25,497
Yeah, I'll die soon and
it'll all be over, John.

1435
01:32:25,832 --> 01:32:27,708
Wow, you're just
like The Lone Ranger!

1436
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:28,834
Yeah, yeah.

1437
01:32:28,919 --> 01:32:30,294
Listen,
are you with him?

1438
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,378
Yeah.

1439
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:34,006
You're talking to
the woman I love.

1440
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:36,050
What happened, man?

1441
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:49,480
Hi, Steve.
Hi, Judy. Hi, Karen.

1442
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:51,273
Where's Laurie?

1443
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:55,569
Well, we know
where she is.

1444
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:57,780
So what?

1445
01:32:57,864 --> 01:32:58,864
So nothing.

1446
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:03,285
Just that she was
with a really cute guy
in a really boss car,

1447
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,664
and we thought
you just might
know who it was.

1448
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,917
I'm sorry,
but I wouldn't know.

1449
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,085
We know.

1450
01:33:11,378 --> 01:33:13,295
His name's Bob Falfa.

1451
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,389
Yes?
Help. No...

1452
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,100
Bring two Cherry Cokes
with lots of ice.

1453
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:28,686
No, never mind. Forget...
Just bring the ice.
Pronto.

1454
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,771
Out. Out.
Get out of the car.
Hey!

1455
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:31,897
Steve,
what are you doing?

1456
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:33,607
Get out.
Just get out
and shut up.

1457
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:34,775
You, too.
Get out. Get out!

1458
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:35,943
What's going on?

1459
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,529
I don't know,
but I'm about
to find out.

1460
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,330
I can't believe it.

1461
01:33:48,415 --> 01:33:50,457
You practically
get killed trying
to get your car back

1462
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,501
and then you
let him have it.

1463
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:55,045
It's not my car.

1464
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:56,588
What?

1465
01:33:57,799 --> 01:33:59,383
It is not my car.

1466
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,304
Well, then,
where is your car?

1467
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,682
I don't have a car.

1468
01:34:07,017 --> 01:34:09,018
Well, what about
your Jeep?

1469
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,479
Well, how am I
gonna get home?

1470
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:21,447
Where's your car?
I have to hang them
on a car.

1471
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:24,325
I need a ride.

1472
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:29,955
Hey, Toad,
what happened
to you, man?

1473
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,540
Did you lose
your car again?

1474
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,500
No, Steve took it.

1475
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:37,838
I want to go to sleep.

1476
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,591
You got to
take it easy when you drive
that car of yours.

1477
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:43,510
You've got to
cruise easy, baby.

1478
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:47,348
Don't be
doing any accidents
or anything on me now.

1479
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:51,101
You know, Terry?
I had a pretty
good time tonight.

1480
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:53,312
Oh, come on.
You're just...

1481
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:54,855
No, no.
Really, really.

1482
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,857
I really
had a good time.

1483
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:00,277
I mean, you picked me up
and we got some hard stuff,

1484
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,864
and saw a holdup,
and then we went
to the canal.

1485
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,783
You got
your car stolen.

1486
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:08,952
And then, I got to
watch you getting sick.

1487
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:12,373
And then,
you got in this
really bitching fight.

1488
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:14,583
I really
had a good time.

1489
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:19,838
Yeah, well, I guess
I have a pretty good time
just about every night.

1490
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:22,341
Well, if I'm not
doing anything tomorrow,

1491
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:24,593
why don't you
give me a call, okay?

1492
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,970
Yeah, all right.

1493
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:28,680
I got a little Vespa
that I just kind of

1494
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:30,265
play around with.
Maybe, you know, we...

1495
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:35,729
Really? Well,
that's almost a motorcycle,
and I just love motorcycles.

1496
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:37,981
You do?
Why didn't you say
something earlier?

1497
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:40,984
We wouldn't have had to
go through all the fun.

1498
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:43,862
I gotta go.

1499
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:45,656
Ow.

1500
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,285
Good night.
See you.

1501
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:56,310
Hey, what do you want?

1502
01:36:56,895 --> 01:36:59,438
Push the red switch down.

1503
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:05,611
I'm looking
for this girl.

1504
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:10,157
Yeah. Aren't we all?
She's not here.

1505
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,868
Come on in the back.

1506
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,370
You just go
around the back.

1507
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:17,289
Thank you.
This way.

1508
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,090
Hey.

1509
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,928
Have a popsicle.
The icebox just broke down

1510
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:32,012
and they're melting
all over the place.

1511
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:33,847
You want one?
No, no. No thanks.

1512
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:35,307
Listen...

1513
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:36,642
Have a popsicle.

1514
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:38,936
Are you the Wolfman?

1515
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,272
No, man.
I'm not the Wolfman.

1516
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,194
Wait a minute.

1517
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:58,205
Who is this on
the Wolfman's telephone?

1518
01:37:58,331 --> 01:37:59,957
Diane.
How're you doing,
Diane?

1519
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,375
That's the Wolfman.

1520
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:02,459
Do you love me?

1521
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:04,002
He's on tape.

1522
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,797
The man
is on tape. Well...

1523
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,635
Where is he now?
I mean,
where does he work?

1524
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,805
The Wolfman
is everywhere.

1525
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:19,810
Well, I gotta give
him this note. Shit!

1526
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:22,688
Can I wizz
on you, Wolfman?

1527
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:25,649
Here, let me
see the note.

1528
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:32,155
Hell, that's just
a dedication, man.

1529
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,615
What I can do
is I relay it.

1530
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,659
It'll be on
tomorrow or Tuesday.

1531
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,911
No, no. See,
this is very important.

1532
01:38:37,996 --> 01:38:40,080
You see, I may be
leaving town tomorrow

1533
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:41,957
and it's very
important that I...

1534
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,002
Damn it. That I reach
this girl right now.

1535
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,338
You don't know
whether you're gonna
leave town or not?

1536
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:52,259
Well, I'm supposed
to go to college
back east tomorrow,

1537
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:55,637
and I don't know
if I'm gonna go.
I don't know.

1538
01:38:56,514 --> 01:39:00,017
Wait a minute.
Have a popsicle.
Have a...

1539
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,226
Huh?
No. No, thanks.

1540
01:39:01,311 --> 01:39:02,311
Sit down a minute.

1541
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:04,354
It's early
in the morning.

1542
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:05,522
Damn.

1543
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:08,859
I can't talk
for the Wolfman,

1544
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:10,986
but I can tell you
one thing.

1545
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:16,283
If the Wolfman
was here, he'd say,
"Get your ass in gear."

1546
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:20,037
The Wolfman comes
in here occasionally

1547
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:23,165
bringing tapes, you know,
to check up on me
and whatnot.

1548
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,042
And the places
he talks about

1549
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:28,170
that he's been,
the things he's seen.

1550
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:31,381
It's a great, big,
beautiful world out there.

1551
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:36,803
And here I sit,
sucking on popsicles.

1552
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:39,389
Why don't you leave?

1553
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,850
I'm not
a young man anymore.

1554
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:44,603
And the Wolfman
gave me my start

1555
01:39:44,687 --> 01:39:46,396
in the business,
and I like it.

1556
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,441
I tell you what.

1557
01:39:49,776 --> 01:39:52,027
If I can possibly
do it tonight,

1558
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:55,322
I'll try to relay
this dedication in

1559
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,574
and get it on the air
for you later on.

1560
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:01,536
That would be terrific.
Really. Thanks.

1561
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:03,080
Just a minute.

1562
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:06,833
Hey, it's been
a pleasure, really.

1563
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,835
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

1564
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,170
Sticky little mothers,
ain't they?

1565
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,546
They really...

1566
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:12,839
Six or seven
of them, right?

1567
01:40:12,924 --> 01:40:15,967
I know. I got a whole
refrigerator full.

1568
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:19,262
Thanks a lot.
Appreciate it.
See you later.

1569
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:29,606
Rock on, baby.
We gonna do it
right here.

1570
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:31,942
Rock and roll
yourself to death.

1571
01:40:32,068 --> 01:40:34,027
Oh, mercy!

1572
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,530
Give me some more!
My, my.

1573
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:53,046
Hey, John,
let me go with you.
Come on.

1574
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:58,301
No, man,
I can't take you when
I'm racing somebody.

1575
01:40:58,386 --> 01:40:59,386
Oh, come on.
Just let me go.

1576
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,888
I just want to watch.
Or I'll flag you, okay?

1577
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:03,724
All right. Go ahead.

1578
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:09,563
Paradise Road.

1579
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,362
All right, now where's
this Paradise Road?

1580
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:20,365
Just follow this street
straight out of town.

1581
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:23,410
Listen, if you're
gonna race John Milner,

1582
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:25,245
you can let me out
right when we get there.

1583
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:27,080
Why don't you
shut up, baby?

1584
01:41:27,165 --> 01:41:29,332
You ain't said
one word all night long.

1585
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:33,295
You're a weird broad.
But you're gonna
appreciate me soon.

1586
01:41:34,714 --> 01:41:36,047
You're gonna be
hanging on for mercy

1587
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:38,008
when I get this
sucker rolling.

1588
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:50,979
Heading out
to Paradise Road?

1589
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:52,814
Paradise Road?

1590
01:41:53,191 --> 01:41:55,776
Some guy named Falfa's
going up against Milner.

1591
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,402
He's racing Falfa?

1592
01:41:57,487 --> 01:41:58,945
Yeah.
Figured something's up.

1593
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:02,032
Saw them head out of
town real cautious-like
and then...

1594
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,956
That's
Heart and Soul, baby.

1595
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:13,210
Hey, I got a dedication here
that's for a friend
of the old Wolfman,

1596
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:15,587
and he wants me to
play the next song

1597
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:18,840
for a blonde young lady
in a Thunderbird,

1598
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:21,092
a white T-Bird,
you understand.

1599
01:42:21,177 --> 01:42:22,636
Now, my friend's name
is Curt,

1600
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,679
and he wants to talk
to you out there, baby.

1601
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:27,140
So you meet him
at Burger City,

1602
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:30,477
or you can phone
Diamond 3132.

1603
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:32,270
Now, he's a friend
of mine, you hear,

1604
01:42:32,355 --> 01:42:33,939
and little girl,
you better call him

1605
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:35,941
or the Wolfman
gonna get you.

1606
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:07,722
Hey, Laurie,
what in the hell are
you doing in there?

1607
01:43:07,807 --> 01:43:09,099
Is she gonna ride
with you?

1608
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,059
Mind your
own business, John.

1609
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:12,602
Yeah, she's going
with me.

1610
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,813
You take care
of yourself, man.

1611
01:43:15,606 --> 01:43:16,648
You guys ready?

1612
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:08,241
Milner,
you son of a bitch!

1613
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:12,037
Laurie. Laurie.

1614
01:44:12,121 --> 01:44:13,997
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1615
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:15,790
Laurie. Laurie.

1616
01:44:21,923 --> 01:44:23,673
Come on,
she's gonna blow.

1617
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:24,758
No, no, no.

1618
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,593
Please, don't come
near me. No, please.

1619
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:28,803
I'm gonna be sick.
Steven.

1620
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:38,772
Oh, Steven!
Steven, please,
don't leave me.

1621
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:40,523
Don't leave me,
Steven.
I won't.

1622
01:44:40,608 --> 01:44:42,400
I couldn't bear it.
Please.
I won't.

1623
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:47,280
I'm not
gonna leave you.

1624
01:44:47,365 --> 01:44:49,074
I promise.
Do you?

1625
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:53,203
I'm not
gonna leave you.

1626
01:45:06,258 --> 01:45:09,052
Oh, that was
beautiful, John.
Just beautiful. Huh?

1627
01:45:10,596 --> 01:45:12,263
I was losing, man.

1628
01:45:12,348 --> 01:45:13,598
What?

1629
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:17,978
He had me, man.
He was pulling away
from me

1630
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:19,604
just before
he crashed.

1631
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:20,814
You're crazy.
You saw it.

1632
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:22,482
No, you creamed him
from right off the line.

1633
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:23,650
The guy never
had a chance.

1634
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:26,569
Shit, Toad!
The man had me!
He was beating me!

1635
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:28,780
John, I don't know
what you're
talking about.

1636
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:30,365
It was the most
beautiful thing
I ever seen.

1637
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:31,533
That guy,
he might as well...

1638
01:45:31,617 --> 01:45:34,244
He can get a wheelchair
and roll himself home.

1639
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:37,372
Man, you got
the bitching-est car
in the valley.

1640
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:40,625
You'll always be
number one, John.
You're the greatest.

1641
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:44,087
Yeah.
Huh?

1642
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,091
Look at
your glasses, man.

1643
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:51,594
Okay, Toad.

1644
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:54,764
We'll take them all.

1645
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:56,683
Right.

1646
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:57,934
We'll take them.

1647
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:00,520
Let's get out of here.

1648
01:46:00,604 --> 01:46:02,272
Jesus, what a night!

1649
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:41,102
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1650
01:46:41,187 --> 01:46:42,228
Curt?

1651
01:46:42,313 --> 01:46:44,606
Yes! Yes.
This is Curt.

1652
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:45,732
Who are you?

1653
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:47,317
Who were you expecting?

1654
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:50,070
Do you drive
a white T-Bird?

1655
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,446
A white '56.

1656
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,281
I saw you
on Third Street.

1657
01:46:53,365 --> 01:46:54,699
Whoo!

1658
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:56,409
Curt?

1659
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:57,827
Who are you?
Do you know me?

1660
01:46:58,204 --> 01:46:59,370
Of course!

1661
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:01,164
How do you know me?

1662
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,665
It's not important.

1663
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:05,418
It's important!
It's important to me!

1664
01:47:05,711 --> 01:47:08,755
You're the most
beautiful, exciting thing
I've ever seen in my life,

1665
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:10,924
and I don't know
anything about you.

1666
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:12,884
Listen, listen, listen,

1667
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:15,929
could we meet
someplace?

1668
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,472
I cruise Third Street.

1669
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:19,641
Maybe I'll see
you tonight.

1670
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:21,476
No, I don't think so.

1671
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,852
Curt.

1672
01:47:23,604 --> 01:47:25,396
Tell me your name.
At least tell me
your name.

1673
01:47:25,481 --> 01:47:26,523
Goodbye, Curt.

1674
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:28,274
Wait a minute!
Wait a second!

1675
01:47:30,694 --> 01:47:33,613
Little kiss on your ear.
Good night, sweetheart.

1676
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:35,365
I'll see you later.

1677
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:38,368
The Spaniels.

1678
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:49,337
Goodbye, Son.
Call us when
you get there.

1679
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:55,552
I'll miss you.
Mmm.

1680
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:02,016
Good luck.

1681
01:48:02,184 --> 01:48:03,768
Yeah, same to you.

1682
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:05,770
Am I gonna see
you there next year?

1683
01:48:05,855 --> 01:48:07,230
Oh, yeah,
I'll be there.

1684
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:08,398
Yeah?

1685
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,072
Bye-bye, Curt.

1686
01:48:21,787 --> 01:48:24,080
Well, stay cool, man.

1687
01:48:24,707 --> 01:48:28,459
And don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

1688
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:31,421
I'll see you, buddy.

1689
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:38,094
I know, you probably
think you're a big shot,
going off like this.

1690
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:41,389
But you're still a punk.

1691
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:43,099
Okay, John.

1692
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,936
So long. So long.

1693
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:48,479
See you.
We'll see you.

1694
01:48:48,564 --> 01:48:49,647
Bye, Curt.

1695
01:48:51,817 --> 01:48:53,443
- See you later.
- Right.

1696
01:48:53,652 --> 01:48:55,320
Have a good trip.

1697
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:57,071
Curt!

1698
01:49:00,993 --> 01:49:02,160
