00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,558
On September 3rd 1973
at 6:28pm and 32 seconds,

a bluebottle fly capable
of 14,670 wing beats a minute

3
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,266
landed on Rue St Vincent, Montmartre.

4
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:58,016
At the same moment,
on a restaurant terrace nearby,

5
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:02,932
the wind magically made two glasses
dance unseen on a tablecloth.

6
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:09,806
Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat,
28 Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9,

7
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:14,640
returning from his best friend's funeral,
Eugène Colère erased his name

8
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:16,765
from his address book.

9
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:25,222
At the same moment,
a sperm with one X chromosome,

10
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:27,681
belonging to Raphaël Poulain,

11
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:31,764
made a dash for an egg in his wife Amandine.

12
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:33,888
Nine months later,

13
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,472
Amélie Poulain was born.

[The Fabulous Life Of Amélie Poulain]

15
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,800
Her father, an ex-army doctor,

16
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:26,300
works at a spa in Enghien-Les-Bains.

00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,299
Raphaël Poulain dislikes:

19
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:35,341
Peeing next to someone else. He also dislikes:

20
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,091
Catching scornful glances at his sandals.

21
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:44,716
Clingy wet swimming trunks.

22
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:49,424
Raphaël Poulain likes:

23
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:51,715
Peeling off large strips of wallpaper.

24
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:57,298
Lining up all his shoes and polishing them.

25
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,548
Emptying his tool box,

26
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,465
cleaning it out,

27
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:06,548
and putting everything back.

28
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:10,714
Amélie's mother, Amandine,
a schoolmistress from Gueugnon,

29
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,839
has always had shaky nerves.

[FACIAL TWITCH = WEAK NERVES]

Amandine Poulain dislikes:
Getting puckered fingers in the bath.

32
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,381
When someone she doesn't like

33
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:24,130
brushes against her hand.

34
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:29,047
Pillow marks on her cheek in the morning.

35
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:33,588
Amandine Poulain likes:
Figure skaters' costumes on TV.

36
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,838
Polishing the parquet with slippers.

37
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,547
Emptying her handbag,

38
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,380
cleaning it out,

Amélie is six.

41
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:52,671
Like all little girls,
she'd like to be hugged by her daddy.

42
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:57,754
But he never touches her,
except for a monthly checkup.

43
00:04:57,795 --> 00:05:00,503
The thrill of this rare contact

44
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,836
makes her heart beat like a drum.

45
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:04,420
As a result,

46
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,545
he thinks she has a heart defect.

...hens fourth!
- No!

Deprived of playmates,

tossed about
between a neurotic and an iceberg,

59
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:35,669
Amélie retreats into her imagination.

60

In this world, LPs are made like pancakes.

61

The neighbor’s comatose wife

62
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,501
has chosen to get all her life's sleep in one go.

63

After this, I can stay awake day and night.

64

Amélie has one friend, Blubber.

65
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:01,792
Alas, the home environment
has made Blubber suicidal.

66
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:23,874
Blubber's suicide attempts
destroy Mother's nerves.

67
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,540
A decision is made.

68

Enough!

69
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:05,622
To comfort Amélie, her mother
gives her a second-hand Instamatic camera.

70
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,871
Little girl! Look what you did!

71
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:25,080
A neighbor fools her into thinking
her camera causes accidents.

72
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:29,788
Because she'd been taking pictures
all afternoon, Amélie is petrified.

73
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:33,829
She stares at the TV, racked by the guilt

74
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,995
of causing a huge fire,

75
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:37,954
two derailments

76
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:39,871
and a jumbo jet crash.

77
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,829
A few days later,

78
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,704
realizing she'd been had,

79
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:45,829
Amélie gets her revenge.

80
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,536
What...?

81
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:29,451
One day tragedy strikes.

82
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:34,826
Amandine takes Amélie to Notre Dame
to light a candle and pray for a baby brother.

83
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:37,242
Three minutes later, heaven sends,

84
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:42,451
alas, not a baby boy, but Marguerite,
a tourist from Quebec,

85
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:44,575
bent on ending her life.

86
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,117
Amandine Poulain is killed instantly.

87
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:57,408
After her mother's death,
Amélie lives alone with her father.

88
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,491
His unsociable tendencies increase.

89
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:04,991
He's obsessed with building a miniature shrine

90
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,241
to house his wife's ashes.

91
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:15,866
Days, months and years go by.

92
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,823
In such a dead world,

93
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:26,532
Amélie prefers to dream
until she's old enough to leave home.

94
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:40,198
Five years later,
she's a waitress in Montmartre

95
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,406
at The Two Windmills.

96
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:45,364
It is August 29th.

97
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:49,114
In 48 hours, her life will change forever.

98
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,780
But she doesn't know it yet.

99
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:58,488
She lives quietly among her colleagues
and the café's regulars.

100
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,030
That's Suzanne, the owner.

101
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:03,904
She limps a little but she's never spilt a drink.

102
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:07,072
When she was younger, she was a circus rider.

103
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:09,696
She likes athletes who cry with disappointment.

104
00:10:09,738 --> 00:10:14,737
She dislikes seeing men humiliated
in front of their kids in her café.

105
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,737
Georgette is the tobacconist.
She's a hypochondriac.

106
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,487
Migraines one day, sciatica the next.
She hates the words

107
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,737
"fruit of thy womb".

108
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:29,946
Gina works with Amélie.
Her grandmother was a healer.

109
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:32,987
She likes cracking bones.

110
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:36,445
She's bringing a kir to Hipolito, a failed writer.

111
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:40,028
He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.

112
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:46,570
Scowling at them is Joseph,
Gina's rejected lover.

113
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:49,194
He's always jealously spying on her.

114
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:50,986
All he likes

115
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:53,986
is popping bubble wrap.

116
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,485
And here's Philomène, an air hostess.

117
00:10:56,527 --> 00:11:00,527
Amélie looks after her cat Rodrigue
when she's away. Philomène likes

118
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:03,486
the sound of the cat's bowl on the tiles.

119
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:07,485
Rodrigue likes overhearing children's stories.

120
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:11,318
No, thanks, ma'am. I never work on Sundays.

121
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:17,067
At weekends, Amélie often takes a train
from the Gare du Nord to see her father.

122
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,067
- Why don't you use your retirement to...?
- To do what?

123
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:23,192
Travel. You've never been away.

124
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:28,776
When we were young,
your mother and I longed to travel.

125
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:32,317
But we couldn't.

126
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,358
- Because of your heart.
- Yes. I know.

127
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,775
So now...

128
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,650
Now...

129
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:42,524
Some Friday evenings,
Amélie goes to the cinema.

130
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:46,233
I like turning round
and looking at people's faces in the dark.

131
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:56,608
I like noticing details
that no-one else ever sees.

132
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:03,232
But I hate it in old American movies
when drivers don't watch the road.

133
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,065
Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend.

134
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:15,481
She tried once or twice,
but the results were a let-down.

135
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:19,357
Instead, she cultivates a taste
for small pleasures.

136
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,897
Plunging her hand deep into a sack of grain.

137
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:25,731
Cracking crème brûlée

138
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:27,772
with a teaspoon.

139
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,397
And skimming stones on the Canal St Martin.

140
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:18,228
They call him the Glass Man.

141
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,020
He was born with bones as brittle as crystal.

142
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:24,478
All his furniture is padded.

143
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:27,895
A handshake would be enough
to crush his fingers.

144
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,061
He's stayed indoors for 20 years.

145
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:36,269
Time has changed nothing.

146
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:38,644
Amélie still takes refuge in solitude.

147
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:43,352
She amuses herself with silly questions
about the world below,

148
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:47,394
such as: "How many couples
are having an orgasm now?"

149
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:58,852
Fifteen.

150
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,810
Finally, on the night of August 30th 1997.

151
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:09,476
comes the event
that will change her life forever.

152
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,184
Lady Di, Princess of Wales,
died in a car crash in Paris last night

153
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:18,142
with her companion Dodi Al Fayed...

154
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:12,598
Only the first man
to discover Tutankhamen's tomb

155
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:14,765
would understand how she felt

156
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:17,014
on finding this treasure

157
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:20,930
hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.

158
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,971
On August 31st at 4am,

159
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:32,097
Amélie has a dazzling idea.

160
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,679
Wherever he was,
she would find the box's owner

161
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:38,013
and give him back his treasure.

162
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:42,846
If he was touched,
she'd become a regular do-gooder.

163
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:44,888
If not, too bad.

164
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:55,637
The girl from the 5th floor!
We don't see much of you.

165
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,970
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the '50s?

166
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:02,262
A boy? Come and have a glass of port.

167
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,845
- No, thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

168
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:11,011
Boys? I've known so many.

169
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:15,344
They're cute until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

170
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:17,469
I've known so many boys.

171
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:21,053
- When did you come here?
- In '64.

172
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:23,844
You'll have heard the story.

173
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:26,093
No, I don't think so.

174
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,969
I'm amazed. Sit down.

175
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:32,677
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.

176
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:36,176
It's no secret that he slept with his secretary.

177
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:40,176
They used every hotel around.

178
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:41,927
Not the grotty ones, either.

179
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:45,301
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

180
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:46,842
but only on satin.

181
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:49,884
So my husband swiped from the till.

182
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,967
A little at first, then 50 million.

183
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:56,300
Off they flew to South America.

184
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,593
Drink up.

185
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:04,675
On January 20th 1970,

186
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:07,133
my doorbell rang.

187
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:12,259
"Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America."

188
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:15,425
My life stopped there.

189
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:18,633
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.

190
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:21,508
Poor creature.

191
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,132
See how lovingly

192
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:28,216
he still stares at his master?

193
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,299
One day

194
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,840
I'll read you his letters.

195
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:33,632
No, don't go!

196
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:36,132
You can spare five minutes.

197
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:37,841
He wrote this

198
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:39,548
from the barracks.

199
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:43,632
"Darling Mado." That's me.

200
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:45,339
I'm called Madeleine.

201
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:48,381
"I can't sleep, can't eat,

202
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:53,215
knowing that my only reason to live
is far away in Paris.

203
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:55,673
I won't see her until a fortnight on Friday,

204
00:17:55,714 --> 00:18:01,505
when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station

205
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,631
in her strappy blue dress."

206
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:08,714
In brackets: "The one you think
is too transparent."

207
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:19,588
Has anyone ever written to you like that?

208
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:23,713
No. I'm nobody's little weasel.

209
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,337
My name's Madeleine Wells.

210
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:29,463
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

211
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:33,004
She wept, right? And Wells as in water.

212
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:37,254
Talk about being born to cry!

213
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:42,670
About your question...

214
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:48,170
Ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

215
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,628
Hello, Amélie-mellow!

216
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,211
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?

217
00:18:54,253 --> 00:18:57,045
Who lived in my flat in the '50s?

218
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:01,086
- What was their name?
- You've got me there, dear.

219
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:05,086
In 1950, I was two.
The mental age of this cretin.

220
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:06,752
The "cretin" is Lucien.

221
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:10,835
He's no genius, but Amélie likes him.
She likes the way

222
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:14,210
he handles each endive like a precious object

223
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:17,460
to be treated with care.
It's his way of showing

224
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:18,918
his love of good work.

225
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,001
Look at him!

226
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:24,502
Like he's nursing a baby bird
that's fallen out of its nest!

227
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,210
Don't ask him for currants!

228
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,876
You'd be here till Monday!

229
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,085
Get moving, spastic!

230
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:34,167
She hasn't got all day.

231
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,209
Here.

232
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:42,959
Go and see my mother.
She has the memory of an elephant.

233
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,167
Elephant Mum!

234
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,959
Thank you.

235
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,666
Bredoteau.

236
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,291
Sorry?

237
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,124
It's the name you're after.

238
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:16,582
But if it's me that says so,
it won't count. I'm senile.

239
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:18,582
Ignore him. He's senile.

240
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:21,707
See what he's done to my laurel?

241
00:20:25,832 --> 00:20:28,499
His old job was punching métro tickets.

242
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:33,748
For three months now,
he's got up every night to punch holes

243
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,289
- in my laurels!
- I'd have preferred lilacs. Such is life!

244
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:41,790
- We all need a way to relax.
- I skim stones.

245
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:45,997
- You do?
- I'll find it. Don't worry.

246
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,997
- I file everything.
- Like what?

247
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,831
Your son's nearly 50
and I'm still doing his book-keeping.

248
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:58,580
You were still squeezing his toothpaste at 15,
so it follows.

249
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:00,997
Right. Camus...

250
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,038
2nd floor on the right. Brossard...
Brossard was on staircase B.

251
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,663
Got it!

252
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:08,829
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.

253
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:11,621
They were from the Pas de Calais.

254
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:14,287
Bredoteau. What more can I say?

255
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:22,660
Groping under the photo booth
is Nino Quincampoix.

256
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:31,784
When Amélie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many.

257
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:47,991
Five miles apart, one dreamed
of having a sister, the other a brother

258
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,075
to spend all their time with.

259
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:12,740
Hi, Dad.

260
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:15,740
A new friend?

261
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:18,990
No, I've had him for years.

262
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:22,948
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

263
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,989
There. Let's reconcile them.

264
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:31,489
There. Not bad, eh?

265
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:40,822
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,

266
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:44,738
how would it make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic? What?

267
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:48,321
I didn't have this gnome when I was a child.

268
00:23:48,363 --> 00:23:51,988
He was a retirement gift from my old regiment.

269
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,488
No, I mean something you hid
like a secret treasure.

270
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,113
I should varnish him before autumn.

271
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:06,654
I'll make some tea. Do you want some?

272
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,779
Breathe in. Hold still.

273
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:12,570
Better now?

274
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:14,487
Shut the door!

275
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:16,570
There's a howling gale.

276
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:18,612
It's hardly Siberia.

277
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:21,236
I can see you're not allergic

278
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,945
to car fumes.
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

279
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,486
Coughed up a pleura? Sure.

280
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:31,111
- What's on the menu today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

281
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:33,611
They'll have you on your knees, you'll see.

282
00:24:33,653 --> 00:24:34,861
They're good, then?

283
00:24:34,903 --> 00:24:37,110
- Depends where.
- If it's at the toilet...

284
00:24:37,152 --> 00:24:38,444
Not good!

285
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:47,943
12:15, laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

286
00:24:47,985 --> 00:24:50,902
He's going to drive me berserk!

287
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,693
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars.

288
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:56,693
Goodbye.

289
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:57,984
Suzanne.

290
00:24:58,026 --> 00:24:59,942
- Suzanne.
- Yes.

291
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:02,734
"Au gratin" means white sauce, right?

292
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:04,401
Yes, why?

293
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:09,484
I can't stomach it. Like you and horse meat.

294
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:12,276
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

295
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:15,109
I'd rather cook human flesh.

296
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:17,192
You're kidding!

297
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:32,692
Suzanne, would you mind if I left early today?

298
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,775
What's his name?

299
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,899
Dominique Bredoteau.

300
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,274
Hello.

301
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:47,316
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?

302
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:48,732
That's me.

303
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:50,774
Why?

304
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:52,899
It's about...

305
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,190
...the petition.

306
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:56,648
Petition?

307
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,440
Yes. The petition to...

308
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:04,773
...to canonize Lady Di.

309
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,481
No, thanks.

310
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,565
No.

311
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:17,939
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you...

312
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:25,064
- Yes?
- Hello.

313
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:28,772
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau
for the European census.

314
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:31,980
Come up. Third floor.

315
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:43,355
Hello, kitten.

316
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,938
Earl Grey?

317
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,063
Jasmine?

318
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:53,146
What will you have?

319
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:58,479
I'm working.

320
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:10,145
There. I'm coming.

321
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:14,561
Do you know where I can find
Dominique Bredoteau?

322
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:16,895
Oh, my poor dear!

323
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:19,144
You just missed him.

324
00:27:20,228 --> 00:27:22,978
Look, there he goes now.

325
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:33,435
Bre-to-deau.

326
00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:36,352
Not Bre-do-teau.

327
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:38,269
You need

328
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:41,810
a glass of mulled wine.

329
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,685
Come in.

330
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:44,976
Come on in.

331
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:52,642
I've lived here for five years.
This is the first time we've met.

332
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:55,434
I never go out on the landing.

333
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:59,475
I'm fussy about who I meet.

334
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,101
They're all creeps anyway.

335
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,892
Come in. Here.

336
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,351
Come in.

337
00:28:08,392 --> 00:28:10,933
They call me the Glass Man,

338
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:14,558
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

339
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:20,017
- Amélie Poulain. I'm a waitress at...
- The Two Windmills. I know.

340
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:26,141
And you've come back empty-handed
from your search for Bretodeau.

341
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:30,932
Because it's not "do", it's "to".

342
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:33,474
- Like "Toto".
- Thank you.

343
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:39,015
I love that painting.

344
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:41,723
It's the Luncheon Of The Boating Party.

345
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:44,473
By Renoir.

346
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:54,265
I've painted one each year for twenty years.

347
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:58,639
The hardest part is the looks.

348
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:04,764
I sometimes feel they deliberately change
their mood as soon as my back's turned.

349
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:06,431
They look quite happy there.

350
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:08,805
They should be.

351
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,889
This year they had hare with morels.

352
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:15,722
And waffles with jam for the children.

353
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:21,304
Now, what have I done
with that piece of paper?

354
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:28,804
Ah, you've noticed my video camera
at the window.

355
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:31,512
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

356
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:34,388
I put it there

357
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:37,387
so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

358
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:41,428
After all these years,

359
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,804
the only person I still can't capture

360
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:48,136
is the girl with the glass of water.

361
00:29:48,178 --> 00:29:49,678
She's in the middle,

362
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,553
yet she's on the outside.

363
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:56,720
Maybe she's just different from the others.

364
00:29:58,137 --> 00:29:59,594
In what way?

365
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:02,678
I don't know.

366
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,927
When she was little, she can't
have played much with other children.

367
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,052
Maybe never.

368
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,135
Here.

369
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:21,093
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

370
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:23,677
It's for you.

371
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:29,884
Every Tuesday morning,
Dominique Bretodeau goes to buy a chicken.

372
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:33,093
He usually roasts it
and has it with sauté potatoes.

373
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:36,426
After carving the legs,
the breast and the wings,

374
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:40,510
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers,

375
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,217
starting with the oysters.

376
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:49,217
But not today. Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.

377
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:50,717
He'll go no further

378
00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:52,425
than this phone booth here.

379
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:06,046
In a flash, it all came back to him.

380
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:09,296
Federico Bahamontes
winning the Tour de France in '59.

381
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:14,380
Aunt Josette's slips.

382
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:20,004
And most of all, that tragic day.

383
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:25,004
That tragic day
when he won all the marbles at break time.

384
00:32:33,837 --> 00:32:34,878
Bretodeau!

385
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:39,212
Bretodeau!

386
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,961
The pinch, Bretodeau!

387
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:51,086
Do you understand, Bretodeau?

388
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:00,169
Cognac, please.

389
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:08,252
It's amazing, what just happened to me.

390
00:33:08,294 --> 00:33:12,501
It must be my guardian angel.
It's the only explanation.

391
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:15,002
It was as if the phone booth was calling me.

392
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:17,460
It rang and rang.

393
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:23,043
Same here. The microwave's calling me.

394
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:27,376
I'll have another cognac.

395
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:37,500
Life's strange.

396
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,417
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.

397
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:48,666
All that's left of your childhood

398
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,958
fits in a little box,

399
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,458
a little rusty box.

400
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:58,416
Have you got kids, miss?

401
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,165
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

402
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,915
We haven't spoken for years.

403
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:15,915
I heard she had a child, a boy.

404
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:18,124
His name is Lucas.

405
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:29,248
I think it's time I looked them up
before I'm in a box myself.

406
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:31,998
Don't you think?

407
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:43,955
Amélie suddenly has a strange feeling
of complete harmony.

408
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:49,955
It's a perfect moment. Soft light,
a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city,

409
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:54,496
She breathes deeply.
Life seems so simple and clear.

410
00:34:54,538 --> 00:34:59,329
A surge of love,
an urge to help mankind suddenly engulfs her.

411
00:35:11,704 --> 00:35:14,329
Let me help you. Step down.

412
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,412
Off we go!
We just passed the drum major's widow!

413
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:20,454
She's worn his coat since the day he died.
Careful.

414
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,620
The horse's head on the butcher's
has lost an ear.

415
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:27,203
That's the florist laughing. He has crinkly eyes.

416
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:30,328
In the bakery window there are lollipops!

417
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,161
Mmm. Smell that.

418
00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:34,453
They're giving out melon slices.

419
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,578
Sugarplum ice cream!

420
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:41,286
We're passing the pork butcher.

421
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:43,744
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45!

422
00:35:43,785 --> 00:35:48,619
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90, cabecous 23.50.

423
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,243
At the butcher's a baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens roasting.

424
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,702
Now we're at the newspaper kiosk
by the métro.

425
00:35:56,743 --> 00:35:58,827
I'll leave you here. Bye.

426
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,532
"She can't relate to other people."

427
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,615
"She was always a lonely child."

428
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:03,531
On a sparkling evening in July,

429
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:06,448
while on the beaches holidaymakers

430
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,073
relax in the new-found sun,

431
00:37:09,114 --> 00:37:11,656
and in Paris the sweltering crowds

432
00:37:11,698 --> 00:37:14,073
gaze at the first bursts

433
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:16,781
of the traditional fireworks,
Amélie Poulain,

434
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:20,572
godmother of outcasts,

435
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,114
Madonna of the unloved,

436
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:25,322
finally succumbs to exhaustion.

437
00:37:25,364 --> 00:37:30,114
In Paris' grief-stricken streets,

438
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:32,989
a vast throng of mourners

439
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,155
line her funeral route in silence

440
00:37:36,197 --> 00:37:40,655
with the measureless sorrow
of newly orphaned children.

441
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:43,821
What a strange destiny for one

442
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,279
who gave her all,

443
00:37:45,321 --> 00:37:50,988
yet took such joy in life's simple pleasures.

444
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:54,654
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself

445
00:37:54,695 --> 00:37:57,862
against the grinding windmill
of all life's miseries.

446
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:12,361
It was a losing battle

447
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:14,403
that claimed her life too soon.

448
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:16,736
At barely 23, Amélie Poulain

449
00:38:16,777 --> 00:38:20,403
let her young, tired body merge

450
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:23,861
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.

451
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:30,152
As she went, she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die

452
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:33,777
without trying to give his stifled life

453
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:38,069
the breath of air she had given

454
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,193
to so many others.

455
00:40:56,312 --> 00:40:57,353
Wait!

456
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:04,186
Wait!

457
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:08,102
Wait...

458
00:41:09,477 --> 00:41:10,519
Wait, wait!

459
00:41:57,058 --> 00:42:02,433
Pages full of dud ID photos
torn up and discarded by their owners,

460
00:42:02,516 --> 00:42:06,141
carefully reassembled by some oddball.

461
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,266
Some family album!

462
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:15,016
A pack of Gauloises.

463
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,141
Just a second. It's so smoky in here.
Can you tell me where they are?

464
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:21,890
- I can't see a thing.
- More to the left.

465
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:23,557
- There?
- A bit more. There.

466
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:28,723
Thank you. You need change.

467
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:31,182
Forget it.

468
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:33,224
- Yes?
- A mauresque.

469
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:35,765
A mauresque for the young man.

470
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:39,223
One kir aligoté, one mauresque,
and two mint sodas.

471
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:42,556
Was that prenuptial or post-coital smooching?

472
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,681
Is your bullshit congenital?

473
00:42:46,723 --> 00:42:48,764
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry.

474
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:50,889
You'll find Mr. Right one day.

475
00:42:52,056 --> 00:42:55,306
All women want to sleep on a man's shoulder.
All of them.

476
00:42:55,389 --> 00:43:00,180
All men snore after a few drinks,
and I have a musical ear.

477
00:43:00,263 --> 00:43:03,972
I had an operation on my nasal cavities.

478
00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:06,097
I see you're a born romantic.

479
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,680
I see you've never known true love.

480
00:43:12,013 --> 00:43:14,554
I did. It shortened my leg.

481
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:20,554
- I thought you fell off a horse.
- I did.

482
00:43:20,637 --> 00:43:23,095
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

483
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:26,428
I should have known.
They always drop you at the last minute.

484
00:43:26,512 --> 00:43:29,178
He dropped me just before my act.

485
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:34,887
It floored me. And the horse.

486
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,970
With me under it.

487
00:43:39,928 --> 00:43:42,262
The mauresque?

488
00:43:42,345 --> 00:43:45,261
Still, true love does exist.

489
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:49,219
I'm not saying it doesn't.
After 30 years behind this bar,

490
00:43:49,302 --> 00:43:52,969
I'm an expert. I can even give you the recipe.

491
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:58,052
Take two regulars.

492
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:01,343
Let each think the other fancies them.
Leave it to simmer.

493
00:44:01,427 --> 00:44:03,302
It never fails.

494
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,426
Excuse me!

495
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,218
Excuse me.

496
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:17,093
- I've had enough.
- I'll go.

497
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,801
Haven't you hurt enough people?

498
00:44:26,634 --> 00:44:28,259
Gina can defend herself.

499
00:44:28,342 --> 00:44:31,592
I don't mean Gina. I mean Georgette.

500
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:35,800
Georgette?

501
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:38,966
Open your eyes! She craves your attention

502
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:40,800
but you only have eyes for Gina.

503
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,383
Poor girl! The things she does

504
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:48,466
to catch your eye!

505
00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:53,091
You really must be blind.

506
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,840
I'm off on a date. Bye!

507
00:45:03,924 --> 00:45:06,007
Goodbye.

508
00:45:08,299 --> 00:45:10,673
Whoever her new one is,

509
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:14,299
he can't be worse
than that nut with his tape recorder.

510
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:17,423
Joseph's not so nutty.

511
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,215
He's just in pain.

512
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:23,256
Come off it, Amélie.
They split up two months ago.

513
00:45:23,298 --> 00:45:26,590
To keep on coming here every day,
he must be a masochist.

514
00:45:26,631 --> 00:45:29,673
Don't say you haven't noticed.

515
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,548
Noticed what?

516
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:35,505
He always sits here, right?

517
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:37,089
Yes.

518
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:38,506
Sit down.

519
00:45:39,547 --> 00:45:40,797
Sit down, Georgette.

520
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,213
- What can you see?
- My cigarette counter.

521
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:49,463
And nothing's missing?

522
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:50,505
No.

523
00:45:51,671 --> 00:45:53,130
Make an effort.

524
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,005
I don't get it!

525
00:46:03,087 --> 00:46:05,670
I'll leave you to think about it. Good night.

526
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:25,253
Good morning.

527
00:46:25,295 --> 00:46:28,795
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.

528
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:35,503
A mailbag found by climbers
on a glacier on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo

529
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:39,128
lost in a plane crash in the late 1960s.

530
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:43,669
So sad! A young, pretty princess for once.

531
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,127
Would it be less sad if she were old and ugly?

532
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:48,377
Of course. Look at Mother Teresa.

533
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:52,793
Is he still chasing Gina?

534
00:46:52,835 --> 00:46:55,085
No, he's after somebody else now.

535
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:59,501
- Anyone I know?
- Yes.

536
00:46:59,543 --> 00:47:01,960
Funny about this glacier.

537
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:04,876
Somebody at The Two Windmills?

538
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:07,043
Not you, surely!

539
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:08,293
No.

540
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:12,292
Not Suzanne.

541
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:14,292
Surely not!

542
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,043
Yes.

543
00:47:19,709 --> 00:47:23,250
- Look. There he is again.
- How strange.

544
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:26,667
- And here.
- Him again.

545
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:28,291
"Gare de Lyon."

546
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:31,208
And here.

547
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,916
"March 5th, Austerlitz."

548
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:36,875
Always the same blank expression.

549
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,458
Twelve times.

550
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,457
I counted.

551
00:47:42,499 --> 00:47:43,832
It's very odd.

552
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:48,833
Why keep taking your picture all over town
only to throw them away?

553
00:47:48,874 --> 00:47:51,708
Good ones, too.

554
00:47:51,748 --> 00:47:54,624
It's like a sort of ritual.

555
00:47:54,665 --> 00:47:56,874
Maybe he's so terrified

556
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,290
of growing old, it's his only consolation.

557
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:03,415
He's dead.

558
00:48:04,665 --> 00:48:05,707
Dead?

559
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,581
Yes. He's scared of being forgotten.

560
00:48:08,623 --> 00:48:12,831
So he uses the photo booths
to remind people what he looks like.

561
00:48:12,873 --> 00:48:17,289
Like faxing his portrait from the afterlife.

562
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:21,330
A dead man who's scared of being forgotten.

563
00:48:21,372 --> 00:48:24,581
At least these guys here have made it.

564
00:48:24,623 --> 00:48:26,747
They're long dead,

565
00:48:26,788 --> 00:48:30,705
but they'll never be forgotten.

566
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,496
- The girl with the glass...
- Yes.

567
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,913
Maybe she's distracted
because she's thinking about someone.

568
00:48:38,955 --> 00:48:40,871
Somebody in the picture?

569
00:48:42,496 --> 00:48:43,538
No.

570
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:46,287
More likely a boy she saw somewhere,

571
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,746
and felt an affinity with.

572
00:48:49,788 --> 00:48:55,954
You mean, she'd rather imagine herself
relating to someone who's absent

573
00:48:55,996 --> 00:49:00,704
than build relationships with those around her?

574
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:04,286
No.

575
00:49:04,328 --> 00:49:08,495
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.

576
00:49:08,536 --> 00:49:10,495
What about her?

577
00:49:10,536 --> 00:49:13,495
And her own messy life?

578
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:17,077
Who'll fix that?

579
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:22,286
It's better to help people than a garden gnome.

580
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:39,199
The driver had 2.8g of alcohol in his blood!

581
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,699
Makes me sick!

582
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,698
Talk about employing irresponsible morons!

583
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,032
Mr. Collignon.

584

- You forgot your keys...
- Hold on, Amélie-mellow. Speed kills.

585
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:51,490
Model yourself on Lucien.

586
00:50:51,532 --> 00:50:55,239
No radar will ever catch him
while he's working, will it?

587
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:57,782
You shouldn't do that, Mr. Collignon.

588
00:50:57,822 --> 00:50:59,740
It's not his fault.

589
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:01,531
True, Mrs. Cauchoix!

590
00:51:01,573 --> 00:51:05,572
It's not his fault he can't sleep. It's Lady Di's.

591
00:51:07,322 --> 00:51:11,697
Guess what I found in the truck.
A lingerie catalogue.

592
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:16,197
He'd pasted Lady Di's face over the model's.

593
00:51:17,613 --> 00:51:19,905
What today? Five asparagus,

594
00:51:19,947 --> 00:51:21,905
or more local history?

595
00:51:21,947 --> 00:51:23,239
Nothing.

596

[KEYS CUT WHILE YOU WAIT]

Thank you.

598
00:51:48,903 --> 00:51:50,986
The migraine seems to be better.

599
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:54,944
Yes, but my sciatica kept me awake all night.

600
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:58,903
- It's ages since I saw you looking so good.
- Really?

601
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:04,070
A woman without love
withers like a flower without sun.

602
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:12,111
Strange weather today.

603
00:52:12,153 --> 00:52:13,819
What's so funny?

604
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,193
Everyone who's come in today
has given us a weather report.

605
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:20,527
We pass the time of day
to forget how time passes.

606
00:52:20,568 --> 00:52:23,111
We do it to keep us from talking crap.

607
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:25,818
I write crap but nobody wants to publish it.

608
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,444
- Another rejection?
- My thirtieth.

609
00:52:28,485 --> 00:52:30,902
Isn't your cousin a book critic?

610
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:33,984
Forget it! Critics are like leeches

611
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:37,317
sucking the blood of writers.

612
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,859
Is your book a love story?

613
00:52:40,901 --> 00:52:44,025
No, it's about a guy who keeps a journal.

614
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:46,401
Not about what's happened to him,

615
00:52:46,443 --> 00:52:49,234
but disasters that might happen in the future.

616
00:52:49,276 --> 00:52:54,609
- So he gets depressed and does nothing.
- So basically, it's about a loafer.

Suzanne,

618
00:52:56,775 --> 00:52:59,441
I'll dedicate the manuscript to you.

He's only doing it so you'll write off his tab!

You're keeping well?

00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:57,766
Pretty much.

635
00:55:59,016 --> 00:56:00,974
I feel a change.

636
00:56:04,974 --> 00:56:07,974
I had two heart attacks
and had to have an abortion

because I did crack while I was pregnant.

Other than that, I'm fine.

654

Then she would know if her dream was viable.

655
00:57:33,428 --> 00:57:38,845
It's called a reality check,
but it's the last thing Amélie wants.

656
00:57:43,469 --> 00:57:44,677
I say!

657
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:47,219
She's not falling in love, is she?

658
00:59:13,714 --> 00:59:16,631
...and 30 makes 50.
- Thanks, Lucien.

659
00:59:16,673 --> 00:59:18,297
Yes, ladies?

660
00:59:18,339 --> 00:59:20,798
- A pound of leeks.
- Two artichokes.

OK.

- Shh! He's sleeping in the cauliflowers.

663

What?

01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:00,988
There's a little...

720
01:05:06,822 --> 01:05:08,072
You're gorgeous

01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:09,821
when you blush.

722
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:13,238
Like a wild flower.

723
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,613
It's my dyspepsia.

It was Amélie. She...

730

Do you know what happened
when they went up Mont Blanc?

731
01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:37,900
The silicon in her face froze up.

732
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:42,441
Her face was a festering mass!

733
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:12,065
Mulled wine and ginger biscuits.

734
01:07:13,107 --> 01:07:14,773
Thank you.

01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:18,023

on the girl with the glass.

736
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:23,023
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

737
01:07:24,565 --> 01:07:25,606
No.

738
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:28,481
They're into different things.

739
01:07:29,523 --> 01:07:32,106

740

You wait, and it flashes past you.

741
01:07:35,814 --> 01:07:39,772
You have to catch it while you can.

742
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,896
Can I help you?

743
01:08:05,938 --> 01:08:09,104
Excuse me.
I found this album in the street and I...

744
01:08:09,146 --> 01:08:13,728
Nino will be so pleased!
He was so sad the other day.

745
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:15,728
I almost prayed to St Anthony.

746
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,479
Is... Nino there?

747
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,312
No. On Wednesdays he works at the funfair.

748
01:08:24,645 --> 01:08:26,728
How long has he had this collection?

749
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:31,228
Since I got him the job here, last year.

750
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:35,478
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

751
01:08:35,519 --> 01:08:41,477
In the daytime
he took pictures of footprints in wet cement.

752
01:08:41,519 --> 01:08:43,686
He's a funny guy.

753
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:46,019
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

754
01:08:49,186 --> 01:08:50,935
Other things like...

755
01:08:50,977 --> 01:08:54,852
Whenever he heard a funny laugh, he'd tape it.

756
01:08:59,018 --> 01:09:00,059
Really?

757
01:09:01,893 --> 01:09:04,518
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

758
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,893
He never keeps them long.

759
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,726
Times are hard for dreamers.

760
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:12,559
Eva! Where are those coffees?

761
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:15,059
I'd better go. Thanks for the album.

762
01:09:15,101 --> 01:09:18,768
It's OK. I've got time to take it to the funfair.

763
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:23,267
Suit yourself. The ghost train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix, like the street.

764
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,641
I'm looking for Nino. Is he here?

765
01:09:49,683 --> 01:09:51,766
He doesn't get off till seven.

766
01:09:53,307 --> 01:09:55,724
- Is there no way to see him before?
- Sure.

767
01:09:57,057 --> 01:09:58,640
20 francs.

768
01:11:09,512 --> 01:11:11,136
See you next Wednesday.

769
01:11:22,803 --> 01:11:27,260
5pm tomorrow, Montmartre carousel
near the phone box. Bring a 5 franc piece.

770
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,468
Want to know about her?

771
01:11:50,093 --> 01:11:52,926
- You know her? You saw her?
- You bet.

772
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,968
She put us in her shirt pocket.

773
01:11:56,052 --> 01:11:57,592
Next to her breast.

774
01:11:57,676 --> 01:11:59,551
Is she pretty?

775
01:11:59,634 --> 01:12:01,550
Not bad.

776
01:12:02,634 --> 01:12:04,634
- Beautiful.
- No, pretty.

777
01:12:04,718 --> 01:12:06,009
- Beautiful.
- Pretty.

778
01:12:06,093 --> 01:12:09,884
- What does she want from you?
- She's broke.

779
01:12:09,967 --> 01:12:12,634
She wants a reward for the album.

780
01:12:12,717 --> 01:12:14,966
Or she collects photos, too.

781
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:19,342
She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!

782
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:25,008
No, you dope!

783
01:12:26,591 --> 01:12:28,925
She's in love.

784
01:12:29,007 --> 01:12:31,757
- I don't even know her.
- Yes, you do.

785
01:12:31,799 --> 01:12:33,591
Since when?

786
01:12:33,675 --> 01:12:35,382
You've always known her.

787
01:12:35,466 --> 01:12:36,716
In your dreams.

788
01:12:49,674 --> 01:12:51,215
Hello?

789
01:12:51,298 --> 01:12:55,339
Yes. You! Man with the plastic bag! It's for you.

790
01:12:56,923 --> 01:12:58,381
- Me?
- Yes.

791

Thank you.

792
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:05,714
Hello?

793
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,548

only a fool looks at the finger.

Hello?

796
01:15:52,747 --> 01:15:55,081
I know the stranger in the pictures.

797
01:15:55,123 --> 01:15:59,206
He's a ghost. He's invisible, Mr. Quincampoix.

798
01:15:59,248 --> 01:16:02,621
He only appears when the film is developed.

799
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:06,038
When a girl has her photo taken,

800
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:12,038
he goes "Oooh!" in her ear,
while he gently caresses her neck.

801
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:14,622
That's how he got caught, Mr. Quincampoix.

802

01:39:36,676 --> 01:39:40,883
and remain an introverted young woman,

975
01:39:40,925 --> 01:39:45,592
she has an absolute right to mess up her life!

976
01:40:20,299 --> 01:40:22,048
What are you doing, Mr. Dufayel?

977
01:40:24,424 --> 01:40:26,548
Tell me, Lucien.

978
01:40:26,590 --> 01:40:31,465
For deliveries,
do you keep keys to all the apartments?

979
01:40:43,922 --> 01:40:47,797
One of your booths is out of order.

980
01:40:49,922 --> 01:40:52,464
It seems to be jammed.

981
01:40:53,588 --> 01:40:55,880
Gare de l'Est ticket hall.

982
01:40:58,713 --> 01:41:01,088
- Buy a video, get one free.
- No, thanks.

983
01:41:07,838 --> 01:41:09,504
Sam?

984
01:41:10,546 --> 01:41:11,587
Samantha?

985
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:15,963
Samantha?

986
01:41:20,878 --> 01:41:22,796
Can you stand in for me at...

987
01:41:45,252 --> 01:41:48,878
Photo booth, Gare de l'Est ticket hall,
Tuesday 5pm.

988
01:41:48,961 --> 01:41:52,252
[Can you stand in for me this afternoon?]

989
01:43:03,457 --> 01:43:04,749
Almost done.

990
01:43:09,915 --> 01:43:13,956
The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of ageing,

991
01:43:13,998 --> 01:43:16,040
but simply the repairman,

992
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:18,581
a normal guy doing his job.

993
01:43:20,706 --> 01:43:22,331
Sorry.

994
01:44:07,954 --> 01:44:11,287
He keeps spying on me!
It's making me sick.

995
01:44:11,371 --> 01:44:14,787
4:05: Blatant female conspiracy.

996
01:44:15,828 --> 01:44:19,245
Gosh, you're tense, Georgette!

997
01:44:20,328 --> 01:44:21,870
Good luck. You'll need it.

998
01:44:27,286 --> 01:44:31,827
Excuse me. Did you put this in my pocket?

999
01:44:31,911 --> 01:44:35,327
- Yes, but I'm not the one...
- I know. Where is she?

1000
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:36,911
She's at her father's.

1001
01:44:36,953 --> 01:44:42,369
It's awkward. I'd like to speak to you, but...
I finish work at six.

1002
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:44,369
- Can you come back?
- OK.

1003
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:46,493
See you later.

1004
01:44:46,535 --> 01:44:50,118
4:08: Docking scheduled.

1005
01:45:21,909 --> 01:45:26,575
The blond guy in a camel coat.
He's very absent-minded, too.

1006
01:45:26,617 --> 01:45:28,366
How come?

1007
01:45:29,408 --> 01:45:31,866
He came back three times the same afternoon.

1008
01:45:33,116 --> 01:45:34,366
1:12:

1009
01:45:34,449 --> 01:45:35,699
Camel coat.

1010
01:45:35,783 --> 01:45:37,032
2:50:

1011
01:45:37,074 --> 01:45:38,907
Camel coat.

1012
01:45:38,949 --> 01:45:41,157
- 4:17: Camel coat.
- Stop it!

1013
01:45:42,198 --> 01:45:45,407
My rash has come back! Look, Suzanne!

1014
01:45:45,449 --> 01:45:49,157
My rash is back. He's driving me nuts.

1015
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:51,365
Lay off!

1016
01:45:51,407 --> 01:45:55,698
If she had a clear conscience,
she wouldn't be in such a state.

1017
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,698
I've had it. I'm going home.

1018
01:45:57,739 --> 01:46:01,240
Psychos are the last straw!

1019
01:46:02,614 --> 01:46:04,656
Georgette! Georg...

1020
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:08,990
Stop smothering them!
Women need to breathe.

1021
01:46:09,031 --> 01:46:12,323
You let them breathe,
they want a change of air.

1022
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:14,239
Fresh air's healthy.

1023
01:46:14,281 --> 01:46:16,281
Shut it, failure!

1024
01:46:18,822 --> 01:46:20,530
Failed writer, failed life...

1025
01:46:20,572 --> 01:46:23,156
I love the word "fail".

1026
01:46:23,196 --> 01:46:25,238
Failure is human destiny.

1027
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,863
It's gasbag time!

1028
01:46:26,905 --> 01:46:30,155
Failure teaches us that life is but a draft,

1029
01:46:30,196 --> 01:46:34,071
a long rehearsal for a show that will never play.

1030
01:46:35,488 --> 01:46:37,821
I bet he stole that.

1031
01:46:37,863 --> 01:46:40,363
I do have some original ideas,

1032
01:46:40,405 --> 01:46:45,863
but people always steal them.
A bit like your women.

1033
01:46:45,904 --> 01:46:47,946
Meaning?

1034
01:46:47,988 --> 01:46:51,196
Meaning you'd better get used to it.

1035
01:46:51,237 --> 01:46:53,779
Speak for yourself, you...

1036
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,862
What?

1037
01:46:58,612 --> 01:47:01,737
- What's going on?
- Nothing much. Georgette went out.

1038
01:47:01,778 --> 01:47:03,528
Joseph got mad.

1039
01:47:03,569 --> 01:47:05,070
"Went out?"

1040
01:47:05,111 --> 01:47:10,319
Just like Gina. You know who's she's with?
The guy with the plastic bag.

1041
01:47:12,028 --> 01:47:14,402
I saw their little game.

1042
01:47:14,444 --> 01:47:16,778
The note in the coat pocket,

1043
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:18,444
4:08.

1044
01:47:18,486 --> 01:47:22,444
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

1045
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:30,027
- I'm worried for Amélie because I like you.
- What do you mean?

1046
01:47:31,068 --> 01:47:34,860
By and large, the men I like
are mentally unsound.

1047
01:47:34,902 --> 01:47:37,943
- I'd like to know more about you.
- Ask me questions.

1048
01:47:40,735 --> 01:47:42,526
One swallow doesn't make...?

1049
01:47:43,610 --> 01:47:44,651
A swallow?

1050
01:47:46,235 --> 01:47:47,776
A summer.

1051
01:47:47,817 --> 01:47:49,192
And clothes...?

1052
01:47:49,234 --> 01:47:50,776
The man.

1053
01:47:50,817 --> 01:47:52,234
- A good cat deserves...?
- A rat.

1054
01:47:52,276 --> 01:47:53,942
- Patience...?
- Is a virtue.

1055
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,567
- Rolling stone...?
- Gathers no moss.

1056
01:47:55,609 --> 01:47:57,942
- It's a sin...?
- To steal a pin.

1057
01:47:57,983 --> 01:47:59,983
Absence makes...?

1058
01:48:00,025 --> 01:48:01,483
The heart grow fonder.

1059
01:48:01,525 --> 01:48:03,525
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

1060
01:48:03,567 --> 01:48:07,900
In my family, we say a man
who knows his proverbs can't be all bad.

1061
01:48:12,483 --> 01:48:15,942
Pretty girl from the 5th floor, listen to this!

1062
01:48:15,983 --> 01:48:18,941
- Do you believe in miracles?
- Not today.

1063
01:48:20,358 --> 01:48:22,524
You're in for a surprise.

1064
01:48:22,566 --> 01:48:25,899
What if I told you that a team of climbers

1065
01:48:25,941 --> 01:48:29,899
on Mont Blanc had found

1066
01:48:29,941 --> 01:48:34,565
hard proof that my husband loved me?

1067
01:49:07,897 --> 01:49:10,022
Lucien, I need some yeast.

1068
01:49:10,063 --> 01:49:13,980
For Miss Amélie?
She's baking her famous plum cake?

1069
01:49:14,021 --> 01:49:16,980
Collignon! Go and get the yeast.

1070
01:50:11,102 --> 01:50:12,727
Amélie?

1071
01:50:12,769 --> 01:50:13,810
Amélie?

1072
01:50:21,143 --> 01:50:22,185
Amélie?

1073
01:50:44,017 --> 01:50:45,059
[I'll be back]

1074
01:51:16,098 --> 01:51:19,099
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.

1075
01:51:35,139 --> 01:51:38,264
So, little Amélie,

1076
01:51:38,306 --> 01:51:42,389
your bones aren't made of glass.

1077
01:51:42,431 --> 01:51:45,556
You can take life's knocks.

1078
01:51:45,598 --> 01:51:49,972
If you let this chance go by,

1079
01:51:50,014 --> 01:51:56,680
eventually your heart will become

1080
01:51:56,722 --> 01:52:02,763
as dry and brittle as my skeleton.

1081
01:52:04,388 --> 01:52:05,929
So...

1082
01:52:05,971 --> 01:52:09,138
Go and get him, for pete's sake!

1083
01:54:56,462 --> 01:55:02,296
[Without you, today's emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday's]

1084
01:55:58,543 --> 01:56:00,251
International airport.

1085
01:56:00,292 --> 01:56:05,334
September 28th 1997. It is exactly 11am.

1086
01:56:05,376 --> 01:56:08,084
At the funfair, near the ghost train,

1087
01:56:08,126 --> 01:56:11,292
the marshmallow twister is twisting.

1088
01:56:11,334 --> 01:56:13,626
Meanwhile, on a bench in Villette Square,

1089
01:56:13,668 --> 01:56:19,125
Félix Lerbier learns there are more links
in his brain than atoms in the universe.

1090
01:56:20,209 --> 01:56:21,333
Meanwhile,

1091
01:56:21,375 --> 01:56:25,042
at the Sacré Cœur,
the nuns are practicing their backhand.

1092
01:56:25,124 --> 01:56:27,500
The temperature is 24°C,

1093
01:56:27,542 --> 01:56:29,416
humidity 70%,

1094
01:56:29,458 --> 01:56:32,708
atmospheric pressure 999 millibars.
