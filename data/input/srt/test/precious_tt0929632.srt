I wish i had a light-skinned boyfriend
with real nice hair.

And i wanna be on the cover of a magazine.

00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,487
But first, i wanna be
in one of them BET videos.

6
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,923
Momma said i can't dance.

7
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:34,485
Plus, she said, who wants
to see my big ass dancing, anyhow?

8
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:38,260
Well, if there's no volunteers,
then I'm going to have to call people.

9
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:42,168
Okay, Leticia, you got number one. 
Leticia!

Jess Wesley, number two.

11
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,833
I like math. 
I don't say nothing.

12
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:51,112
I don't open my book, even.
I just sit there.

13
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,738
- You down?
- Number six.

14
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:56,774
Every day I tell myself
something's gonna happen.

15
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:57,978
I'm. . . I'm dead serious.

16
00:01:58,087 --> 00:02:00,419
Like, I'm gonna break through.

17
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,686
Or somebody's gonna break through to me.

18
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:06,424
I'm gonna be normal

19
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:09,430
and pay attention,
and sit ln the front of the class.

20
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:11,693
Distributive principles. . .

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,858
Someday.

22
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:15,198
. . .are principles that
you can do in your head.

23
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:17,363
I like Mr. Wicher.

24
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,709
I pretend he my husband
and we live someplace like Westchester.

25
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:27,441
Look at him. 
He like me, too, I know it.

26
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:32,984
I can tell by his eyes.
He always looking at me and smiling at me.

27
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:35,148
Boys! Boys ! Boys!

28
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:36,452
I'm not your fucking boy!

29
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:37,651
You're disrupting the class.

30
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:40,160
Yeah, well, I'm talking now,
so you listen.

31
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:43,827
Shut the fuck up ! 
I'm trying to listen !

32
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,401
Mr. Wicher know i got his back.

33
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,362
One twenty-two.

34
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,033
Why are we barking, Jess?

35
00:02:55,577 --> 00:03:00,014
Monday's assignment.
I'm assuming everybody did it.

36
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,407
- No.
- No.

37
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:10,487
Please. . . Quiet. 
Precious, get your things.

38
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,652
I have. . . 
Come here for a second.

39
00:03:12,728 --> 00:03:13,854
Now this shit.

40
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:16,921
Is there anybody
who didn't do their homework?

41
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:24,236
Why? These aren't requests.
These are requirements. Okay?

42
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,845
You have to go to the principal's office.

43
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:42,851
Go to the principal's office!

44
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:45,860
All right, that's enough. That's enough.

45
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:49,288
No, he's not allowed on campus.
Where was he seen?

46
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:51,296
Could you get Mr. Tork from Room 25,

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,800
tell him to go to Room 16 right away?
Thank you.

48
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:56,632
No. He was seen on the second floor.

49
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,464
Yes. Thank you.

50
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:01,734
Send Claireece in here!

51
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,971
She's ready for you now.

52
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:12,950
Mr. Taylor? Ms. Lichenstein.

53
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:14,752
Come in.

54
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:17,489
Matthew Williams, second floor.

55
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:21,626
In front of his locker.
Yes. Suspended last week.

56
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,559
Yeah.

57
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:28,295
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

58
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:31,268
Hello, Claireece.

59
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,074
Are youpregnant?

60
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:49,415
You're 16. 
You're still in junior high school,

61
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:54,128
and you're pregnant with your second child.

62
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:56,357
Is that correct, Claireece?

63
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:01,102
Are youpregnant again?

64
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,775
What happened, Claireece?

65
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:13,542
I had sex, Ms. Lichenstein.

66
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:23,014
Do you have any other thoughts
about your situation, Claireece?

67
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,629
Claireece?

68
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,727
Am I in trouble?

69
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,333
Thank you. 
I gotta get back to math.

70
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:39,499
Sit down , Claireece. 
Sit down right now.

71
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,510
We should have a parent-teacher's
conference with you, me and your mother.

72
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,674
My mother's busy.

73
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,081
All right. Well then,
how about if i come to your house?

74
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:52,153
if i were you , I wouldn't.

75
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:54,917
I . . . 
I'm going to have to suspend you.

76
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:59,083
That ain't fair! I didn't do nothing!
I do my work!

77
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,252
My grades is good!

78
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,262
Is something going on at home?

79
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:06,494
If something's going on at home,
I want you to tell me right now.

80
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,271
You get my cigarettes?

81
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,547
No, they didn't have it.

82
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,883
I played the number, though.
I couldn't box it.

83
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,383
Yes. Yeah.

84
00:06:57,252 --> 00:07:00,050
Right there. Yeah. 
Daddy loves you.

85
00:07:09,164 --> 00:07:11,098
Precious, what did you think of the film?

86
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,326
I thought it was fabulous.

87
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,925
- What's next for you?
- What?

88
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:17,597
- How are you feeling?
- I feel great!

89
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,098
Just one more, just one more, quick!

90
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,803
I love you , too!

91
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,408
You know i love you !

92
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,073
Hey, boo!

93
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:38,588
I ain't gonna say it no more.

94
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,926
The door was open, so I let myself in.

95
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:49,368
Well, there goes my chance
to tell you I'm not home.

96
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:51,667
Now, Mary, this is important.

97
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:58,203
Now, come on, Mary,
she'll have a great time.

98
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:01,714
I'd enroll myself, but i became ineligible
for teen pageants a few days ago.

99
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:05,619
Yeah, I see your acne's cleared up.

100
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:08,853
You know, this pageant can do Brenda
a world of good, Mary.

101
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:12,620
And the man in charge, he's tops
in his field. A brilliant promoter.

102
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:14,794
How long have you two been dating?

103
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:18,324
A dance teacher.

104
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:23,204
Tell them assholes to stop ringing my bell.

105
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,964
I hate crackheads.

106
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:29,540
No one ever ring this bell
except for crackheads.

107
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,737
Why they fucking with us?

108
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:39,652
Stop ringing the goddamn buzzers,
motherfuckers!

109
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,882
Give the ghetto a bad name.

110
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,095
Stop ringing the goddamn buzzer!

111
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,936
Stop it!

112
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:02,838
Stop it!

113
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,269
press ''listen,'' stupid.

114
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:14,453
It's Sandra Lichenstein
for Claireece and Ms. Mary Johnston.

115
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,459
Who is that, Precious?

116
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:22,053
White bitch from school.

117
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:31,133
What do you want?

118
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,132
Claireece, I want to talk to you
about your education.

119
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,914
Eighty-six that bitch.

120
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,741
My mother don't wanna get cut off welfare.

121
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:46,379
And that's just what this visit
gonna result in.

122
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:52,420
Ms. Lichenstein, get out of here
before i kick your ass.

123
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:54,758
All right, Claireece, 
I spoke to Mr. Wicher,

124
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,663
and he told me
that you're one of his best math students.

125
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:00,735
If your fat ass don't get
that bitch away from here. . .

126
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:03,430
...like a, like a potential for math.

127
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:05,063
So i called Mrs. McKnight

128
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,270
from Higher Education Alternative
Each One Teach One.

129
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:12,273
It's an alternative school.

130
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,346
Claireece, are you listening to me?

131
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:16,984
Yeah.

132
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:20,953
Okay. Mrs. McKnight. 
Each One Teach One.

133
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:27,026
It's located at the 11th floor,
Hotel Theresa, 125th Street.

134
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:29,996
- Get rid of that bitch.
- The semester started a few days ago,

135
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:31,122
so you're not too late.

136
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,757
Eleventh floor.

137
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:34,829
I heard you the first time.

138
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:36,966
Okay.

139
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:42,707
I don't know what an alternative school is,
but i feel i wanna know.

140
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,943
My heart is all warm inside.

141
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:50,443
Mr. Wicher think I'm a good student.

142
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:53,955
I knew that he liked me.

143
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,476
School ain't gonna help none!

144
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:19,070
Take your ass down to the welfare.

145
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:21,411
Who the fuck she think she is?

146
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,185
So I guess you think you cute now, right?
Uppity bitch.

147
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:30,247
You should have kept
your fucking mouth shut.

148
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,151
Just 'cause he gonna give you
more children than he give me,

149
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:36,493
you think you something fucking special?

150
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,556
Fuck you and fuck him!

151
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,335
Precious!

152
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:48,739
Precious! Precious!

153
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,370
Get down here, bitch!

154
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,846
You brought that white bitch up
in my house !

155
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:56,683
You . . .
Why would you bring that bitch up in here?

156
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:57,775
I didn't bring her here.

157
00:11:57,886 --> 00:12:00,753
Well, why the fuck did she ring my buzzer?

158
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:03,585
I can't hear you, Precious.

159
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,717
Since you got
so much motherfucking mouth,

160
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:07,455
and you gonna bring a bitch up
in my house,

161
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,587
why would that bitch ring
my goddamn buzzer?

162
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:11,393
I didn't tell her to come here.

163
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:15,197
See, i think right now, you feeling
like you're becoming a grown woman.

164
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,101
'Cause of that shit you pulled
in the kitchen .

165
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:20,572
I should've fucked you up,
but i let you walk away,

166
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,576
and I let you come get yourself together.

167
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:25,704
But, bitch, I'm gonna let you know
if you ever pull that shit on me again,

168
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,305
that will be your last
motherfucking day standing,

169
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,405
I promise you that.

170
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:32,044
You gonna send a white bitch
to my motherfucking buzzer?

171
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,747
Talking about some higher education?

172
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:37,087
You're a dummy, bitch,
you will never know shit.

173
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:39,456
Don't nobody want you.
Don't nobody need you.

174
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:42,155
You done fucked around
and fucked my motherfucking man

175
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:44,164
and had two motherfucking children,

176
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,927
and one of them is a goddamn animal,

177
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:49,095
running around,
looking crazy as a motherfucker.

178
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,163
Bitch, you know what?
See, I think you. . . I think you're trying me.

179
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:57,778
I think you're really trying to fuck with me.
You're fucking with my money.

180
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,939
And you're gonna stand up there
and look down at me

181
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:01,607
like you're a motherfucking woman.

182
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:03,651
I'm gonna show you
what real women do, bitch.

183
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:06,186
See, you don't know
what real motherfucking women do.

184
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:08,256
Real motherfucking women sacrifice.

185
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:11,690
I should've aborted your motherfucking ass.
'Cause you ain't shit.

186
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:14,353
I knew it the day the doctors put you
in my goddamn hand

187
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:15,952
you wasn't a goddamn thing,

188
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:18,329
and you have that smirk
on your face, bitch?

189
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,128
Get it off your fucking face!

190
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:23,796
Now smile about that!
Smile about that, you fat bitch.

191
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,502
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

192
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,150
Get off me, bitch !

193
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:44,824
And ''blank'' and eggs?

194
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:46,224
- Bacon?
- Right.

195
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,853
- And ''What's up, Doc?'' He eats these.

196
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:52,330
- Right. And ice, it comes in a tray.
- Ice cubes.

197
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,335
Right. And the best part of the steak. 
The. . .

198
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:56,870
- The T-bone. The. . .

199
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:58,302
- Filet mignon.
- Right!

200
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:01,831
- And an English. . . Thomas' English. . .
- Muffin!

201
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,707
- Right.
- That's it!

202
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:14,822
You really need to get some rest.

203
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,687
You have such a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

204
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,922
And remember, Mommy loves you.

205
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:29,601
Describe these things that are planned.
Things that are planned. Ready? Go!

206
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:35,902
Precious, you know i love you.

207
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,002
I'm gonna kick that white lady
out of my house,

208
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,911
move you in with me.

209
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,108
Wanna live in Westchester?

210
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:46,284
- Commit a. . .
- Crime.

211
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,356
And this is you get back together again.

212
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:49,447
- A class. . .
- Reunion.

213
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,047
And this is when you're like this,

214
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:52,388
- you're expecting. . .
- Pregnant.

215
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,928
- Yeah. And this is you make a fast. . .

216
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,758
- Right.
- That's it!

217
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:30,924
Where you going?

218
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,261
Where you going?

219
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:37,494
Make sure youplay my 852
and tell them to box it.

220
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:43,168
And get some kitty litter.

221
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:49,447
Ethel, where you at?

222
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:54,615
Precious, what are we gonna play?

223
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:55,678
Girl, get the fuck out of here.

224
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,257
Ain't you supposed to be
at school or something?

225
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:58,952
You said we was gonna play.

226
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:01,154
That's exactly why
we ain't gonna be playing.

227
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:02,820
I never said nothing like that.

228
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:08,690
You would say some shit like that to me,
and you don't even mean it?

229
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:12,927
No, I'm not playing with you.
No, and she call. . . Hold on.

230
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:16,403
Eaoh One Teach One, hold , please.

231
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:20,396
Yes. She called my house.
I know it wasn't your sister, Trey.

232
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:23,043
Because it wasn't her.

233
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,511
What this is here?

234
00:17:29,117 --> 00:17:30,448
Each One Teach One.

235
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,377
I'm looking for an alternative school.

236
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:35,251
This is an alternative.

237
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:37,449
What alternative is?

238
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,027
What exactly are you asking me?

239
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:42,119
Lady at my other school
told me to come here.

240
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,563
Hotel Theresa.
Said it's an alternative school.

241
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:51,697
An alternative sohool, it's like a choice.
It's a different way of doing things.

242
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:55,436
So, i need your discharge papers
saying that they discharged you.

243
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:58,444
I got kicked out of school
'cause i was pregnant.

244
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:01,413
Well, i still need your discharge papers,
otherwise we can't let you in.

245
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:03,541
Ms. Lichenstein didn't say all that.

246
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:05,950
You the one she called about.

247
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,484
Claireece P. Jones?

248
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:13,324
They already sent over
your discharge papers and stuff.

249
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:15,055
I could start today?

250
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:18,462
Yeah. 
Are you currently receiving AFDC?

251
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:21,592
My mother get AFDC
for me and my daughter.

252
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:24,900
So your mother has custody of you and
your daughter, and you're on her budget?

253
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,942
Okay, well, I'm gonna need a copy
of your mother's budget,

254
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,001
and a copy of your phone bill
and your utility bill.

255
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:34,411
We gotta give you a few tests,
test your reading and your math level,

256
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:36,143
see where to place you.

257
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:39,651
Hold on, baby. 
Each One Teach One, hold.

258
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:45,116
To enter into the GED classes,
you gotta get an 8.0 or better on the TABE.

259
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:19,720
There's always something wrong
with these tests.

260
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,956
These tests paint a picture of me
with no brain.

261
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,326
These tests paint a picture
of me and my mother,

262
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:29,870
my whole family, 
as less than dumb.

263
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:34,032
Just ugly, black grease to be wiped away,
find another job for.

264
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,040
Sometimes i wish, i was dead.

265
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:43,411
I'll be okay, i guess, 
'cause I'm looking up.

266
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:48,178
I'm looking up for a piano to fall.

267
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:52,215
Or a desk, couch, TV. . . Momma, maybe.

268
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:55,422
Always something in my way.

269
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:57,753
Yeah, man.

270
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,095
Yo, make sure you get that
for me, too, man.

271
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:01,691
Alternative.

272
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,760
Man, you gotta stop smoking
them shits, man.

273
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,169
That ain't the only thing
that's gonna fucking kill you.

274
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,105
Hustling in these streets gonna kill you.

275
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,172
It is what it is.

276
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,337
Then my mind come back down to Earth.

277
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:15,945
Let me get some of 
that sweet ass, orca!

278
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:17,440
What up, mama?

279
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:19,577
Why boys always 
grabbing on themselves?

280
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:23,521
You heard what the fuck I said?
I said give me some fucking ass.

281
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:26,389
I'm serious!
When you gonna let me hit that?

282
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:27,519
That bitch is laughing. . .

283
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:28,960
I wish they'd leave me alone.

284
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:31,054
- She's stupid.
- Yeah .

285
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:35,600
Yo, that's not even funny.

286
00:20:36,137 --> 00:20:38,469
That's what she'd get anyway, no.

287
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:42,471
Precious!

288
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:45,232
Ma, i need some money!

289
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:51,164
Ma, I'm hungry!

290
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,766
Come take care of Mommy, Precious.

291
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:03,078
I wish she'd stop this shit.

292
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,082
The other day i cried.

293
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:16,858
I felt stupid. 
But you know what?

294
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:19,059
Fuck that day.

295
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:24,202
That's why God, or whoever,
makes new days.

296
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:26,634
Still hungry, though.

297
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,812
Nigger wants me to leave my kids.

298
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,540
They're my kids.

299
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:43,588
- What d'you want, baby?
- Give me a basket, please.

300
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,489
- Sides?
- I don't know yet.

301
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:49,222
Still thinking about it.
Trying to watch my figure.

302
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:56,059
Butchie, you got a 10-piece ready?

303
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:19,349
potato salad.

304
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,020
Thank you.

305
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,865
Hell, no, she didn't!

306
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,938
Get her ass! 
Get that big bitch!

307
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:08,034
No, i am not the one.

308
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:16,308
You in ABE?

309
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:19,471
Yeah.

310
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:22,877
Time's a-wasting.

311
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:47,902
What's your name?

312
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:50,175
Claireece.

313
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,141
Are you coming in?

314
00:26:59,587 --> 00:27:02,021
That door closes in 20 seconds.

315
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:09,692
How are you guys doing today?

316
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,792
Would you like to join us, Consuelo?

317
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:17,460
Consuelo, class is beginning.

318
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:23,771
You guys know
that you are in the ABE class.

319
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:27,770
This is not GED.
This is to get you ready for your GED.

320
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:52,361
These journals are very important
to this class, so do not forget them.

321
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:54,839
You will need to use them every day
that you are here.

322
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,376
They are the key to this class.

323
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:57,808
It's 9:07, Joann. 
You're late.

324
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:00,506
You're the one who said breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.

325
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:03,550
Tomorrow, that door will be looked at 9:00.

326
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,520
I want you to state your name,
where you were born,

327
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:15,255
your favorite color, something you do well
and why you're here.

328
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:18,158
I'll go first.

329
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:19,756

00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:39,880
And I'm here

336
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,782

338
00:28:46,427 --> 00:28:47,894

339
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:51,955
I wish i could sing.

340
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:54,231

341
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:59,034
All right.

342
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,239

344
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:11,142
I was born in Kingston, Jamaica,
and my favorite color is blue.

345
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:13,244
And i cook good.

346
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,948
My mother, she used to have a restaurant
over on 7th Avenue.

347
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:18,616
Before she get sick,
she teach me everything.

348
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:22,560
So I'm here to get my reading up,
so i can get my GED.

349
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:31,329
My name is Rita Romero.
I was born here in Harlem.

350
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:36,675
I'm here 'cause i was an addict
and I dropped out of school.

351
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:40,639
So i never got
my reading and writing together.

352
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:42,978
My favorite color's black.

353
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:44,448
What do you do good?

354
00:29:44,518 --> 00:29:47,282
''Well,'' Joann. 
''What do you do well?''

355
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:50,289
- What do l do well?
- No. Rita?

356
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:53,620
I'm a good mother. 
Very good mother.

357
00:29:57,031 --> 00:30:00,091
My name's Jermaine.
My favorite color is red.

358
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:02,294
Tell us where you were born first.

359
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:05,532
I was born in the Bronx. 
Still live there.

360
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,541
My favorite color is red. 
Used to be blue.

361
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,139
I can dance real good.

362
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:15,443
Homie of mine told me
about Each One Teach One,

363
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:18,280
so I came here to stay out of trouble.

364
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:21,150
So you came here to Harlem
to stay out of trouble? Is that right?

365
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:22,620
Yeah.

366
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,352
- Consuelo?
- This is bullshit.

367
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,983
You think so?

368
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:33,131
Claireece?

369
00:30:35,736 --> 00:30:37,397
Can i skip, too?

370
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:40,873
Joann?

371
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:44,410
Okay. I'm Joann. Hey.

372
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:49,242
My favorite color is fluorescent beige

373
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,217
and my ambition is to have
my own record layer.

374
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,343
What's a record layer?

375
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,355
Tell us where you come from
and why you come to this school.

376
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:58,391
I was born in Kings County Hospital,

377
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,892
but my mother moved us to Harlem
when i was nine.

378
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:06,022
I'm here to get my GED, and then. . .
Well, I'm already into the music industry.

379
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,695
I'm just trying to take oare of
this little education thing so i can move up.

380
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,833
Let's begin. 
This is ABE.

381
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:16,239
Can i go?

382
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:25,114
I wish I could sit
in the back of the class again.

383
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:37,688
My name Claireece ''Precious'' Jones.

384
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,562
I go by Precious.

385
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:45,703
I live in Harlem. 
I like yellow.

386
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:52,804
And i had problems at my other school,
so i come here.

387
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:57,083
Something you do well?

388
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:00,951
Nothing.

389
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:03,987
Everybody's good at something.

390
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,459
Come on.

391
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:15,796
Well, I can cook. And. . .

392
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,070
I never really talked in class before.

393
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,175
How does that make you feel?

394
00:32:34,588 --> 00:32:35,748
Here.

395
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:41,517
It makes me feel here.

396
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:45,989
Everybody open their journal.

397
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:50,126
Write the date at the top of the page,
and write.

398
00:32:51,672 --> 00:32:53,936
I don't care if you 
spell everything wrong.

399
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:56,134
I don't care if it's grammatically incorrect.
But just write.

400
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,939
Write anything that you're feeling.

401
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:00,343
This class will be a revolving door.

402
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:03,610
Some of you will make it
and some of you won't.

403
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,048
Fifteen minutes. 
Go.

404
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:15,056
Before, I got a A- at English,
and I didn't have to say nothing.

405
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:20,493
Ms. Rain said we gonna read
and write in our notebooks every day.

406
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,728
How we supposed to do that?

407
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:28,340
But then she see the worry on my face
and she say,

408
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:31,571
''The longest journey
begin with a single step.''

409
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:36,882
Whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.

410
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,508
Come on, come on, do the work.

411
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:43,022
You love it, love it, learn it.

412
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:45,490
Consuelo?

413
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,093
''C'' for Consuelo.

414
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:50,325
''C'' for kiok your ass.

415
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:52,729
It's ''K'' for kick your ass, stupid.

416
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,824
I got the ''D,'' Ms. Rain.

417
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:00,662
''D'' for dick.

418
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:03,601
Ms. Rain, tell this little-ass bitch
that she don't know me.

419
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,678
Which you wish you had.

420
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:15,085
- Help her.
- ''E.''

421
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:16,280
''E.''

422
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:19,784
''E.''

423
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,878
''F'' for fat.

424
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:50,551
What?

425
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:52,151
Good.

426
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:58,822
Hey! Hey! Hey! Quit it! Hey!

427
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,832
- What?
- Hey, you stop it right now!

428
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,459
- You fucking. . .
- Quit it!

429
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,662
- She just hit me!
- Drop it!

430
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:05,897
Shut the fuck up!

431
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,232
She just slapped me!

432
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:09,639
Get out.

433
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:12,972
We don't fight in my class. Sit down.

434
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,682
''C'' for cold.

435
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:31,253
Do you live with anybody?

436
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,998
My mother.

437
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:36,362
What does she do?

438
00:35:38,538 --> 00:35:40,438
She don't do nothing.

439
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,878
I want you to read 
a page from this book.

440
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:56,315
Try.

441
00:35:58,058 --> 00:36:01,892
All I need you to do is sound out
these words for me.

442
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,519
You don't have to know every word.

443
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,327
You just have to. . . It doesn't matter
if you stumble or. . . Try for me. . .

444
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:11,531
. . .or trip up on it.
You just need to say what you know.

445
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:15,233
Come on. You can do this.
Try. Take it word by word.

446
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,901
- Are you listening to me?
- Precious!

447
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:21,003
I just wanna know where you are
in your reading skills.

448
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:22,378
'Cause I'm looking at your test scores. . .

449
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,973
Some higher fucking learning.
You're a dumb bitch!

450
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:26,679
Try to read, okay?

451
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:29,085
Just help me and then I can help you.

452
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,590
We'll start from scratch. 
Word for word.

453
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:34,217
I want you better than your mother.

454
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:37,696
- I'm gonna call the nurse.
- No.

455
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:45,102
It all look the same to me.

456
00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:50,367
What's this?

457
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:55,112
I can't do that, Ms. Rain.

458
00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:57,844
push yourself.

459
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,614
A.

460
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:04,890
What's this word?

461
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,930
Do you know the letters? Come on.

462
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:15,626
''D.''

463
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:20,270
''A.''

464
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,240
''Y.''

465
00:37:23,977 --> 00:37:25,968
Do you know that word?

466
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:29,710
''Day.''

467
00:37:31,818 --> 00:37:33,615
What word is that?

468
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:37,486
Ate. Ate.

469
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,991
Good. Almost. 
The word is ''At.''

470
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:43,056
''At.''

471
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:46,927
''The.''

472
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:50,728
Sound it out.

473
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:52,294
''Beach.''

474
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:55,499
The word is ''Shore.''
It's almost like ''Beach.''

475
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:57,676
Very good.

476
00:37:58,311 --> 00:38:00,836
Now, read the whole thing for me.

477
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:04,009
''A

478
00:38:05,585 --> 00:38:06,984
''Day

00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:11,750
''At The

480
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:14,192
''Shore.''

481
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,027
Get your big ass in here.

482
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:39,014
Where was you at this morning?

483
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:48,183
You hear me talking to you?
Where was you at this morning?

484
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:50,661
School. I was at school.

485
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,163
You a lying whore.

486
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,223
- I'm not lying.
- You is.

487
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,326
The welfare done called here saying
they gonna remove you from my budget

488
00:38:57,404 --> 00:38:59,304
'cause you ain't been
attending school regularly.

489
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:01,067
I told you, I got kicked out.

490
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:03,199
I been home nearly every day
for two weeks now.

491
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,677
You ain't told me nothing
about no damn school today.

492
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:09,738
I told you i was going
to school this morning.

493
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:14,649
You plan on putting some food
in that frying pan?

494
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,492
Precious, you got something
you wanna say?

495
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:24,689
- No.
- Then don't be slamming shit down in here.

496
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:26,356
You understand?

497
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:28,734
Yes, ma'am.

498
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:33,873
You need to forget about that school shit
and take your ass down to the welfare.

499
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,771
I'm getting a stipend from school.

500
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:38,071
Fool, what the fuck is a stipend?
What is that?

501
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:41,739
Fuck a stipend.
I said take your ass down to the welfare.

502
00:39:41,848 --> 00:39:42,940
Right now?

503
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:46,712
Why in the fuck would you go right now?
It's at night time. Shit is closed.

504
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:48,048
You gotta be there by 7:00 am.

505
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:50,715
in the morning
if you wanna talk to somebody.

506
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,417
Fucking stupid.

507
00:39:56,096 --> 00:39:59,759
You think you're too good now?
Is that what it is?

508
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,468
You think you is too good for the welfare?

509
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,109
There's more white folk getting assistance
than it is niggers, Ms. Onassis.

510
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:14,538
I think i said therapy. . .

511
00:40:14,614 --> 00:40:18,380
Hurry your ass up.
i am in here fucking starving.

512
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,746
Now what you gonna do
if I die of starvation?

513
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,981
Where you gonna go after that?

514
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:26,125
I forgot. School.

515
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:30,427
Each. . . What that bitch say?
Each one do what?

516
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:32,590
Each one teach one?

517
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,133
Well, they don't know
who the fuck they teaching,

518
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:36,395
'cause you can't learn shit.

519
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:39,804
Keep on listening to them white people.

520
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:42,568
That's what's gonna get you fucked up.

521
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,409
Precious, I'm hungry.

522
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:17,207
You ain't cooked no collard greens
with the fucking pigs' feet?

523
00:41:17,711 --> 00:41:20,703
Like, how am I supposed to eat pigs' feet
with no collard greens?

524
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:24,648
And why in the fuck does that pigs' feet
have so much hair in it?

525
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:28,017
You eat it. 
You come eat this shit.

526
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:30,385
- I'm not hungry, though.
- Yes, you is.

527
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,653
Precious, if you don't get
this goddamn plate. . .

528
00:41:39,065 --> 00:41:43,559
You just fix mine when you get done.
Since you fucked it up, you gonna eat it up.

529
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,005
Hurry up and eat, Precious.
I'm fucking hungry, too.

530
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:53,478
And don't let it get cold ,
'cause cold-ass pigs' feet is nasty as shit.

531
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:05,339
So, tell me about. . .
Tell me about your home life.

532
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:10,872
Ain't nothing to really talk about.

533
00:44:11,384 --> 00:44:13,875
You're in a safe place. 
Just talk.

534
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,209
What's going on?

535
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:16,652
What's the first thing
that comes to your mind

536
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:18,850
when you think about home?

537
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:22,655
I just wish i had my own TV,
so I could watch it in my room.

538
00:44:23,396 --> 00:44:26,957
lf I had my own TV,
I wouldn't have to watch it with my mother.

539
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:29,831
And what's it like,
watching TV with your mother?

540
00:44:29,903 --> 00:44:32,667
You enjoy watching TV with your mother?

541
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:37,733
I need to know about your home life.
I need to know what it's like where you live.

542
00:44:38,745 --> 00:44:40,872
My mother's like a whale on the couch.

543
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,973
She say I eat all the time,
but she always making me eat.

544
00:44:45,051 --> 00:44:47,246
Then she call me a fat mess.

545
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:50,481
She say the apartment
is little 'cause of me.

546
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:53,355
Only time she ever leaves
is to play her numbers.

547
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:56,361
I feel like i could just sit in the house
with her every day,

548
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:57,862
the shades drawn,

549
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:02,163
watch TV, eat, watch TV, eat again.

550
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:05,266
Can you help out with that?

551
00:45:06,506 --> 00:45:09,168
Can we talk about something else now?

552
00:45:15,448 --> 00:45:17,382
How about your firstborn?

553
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,781
Mongo?

554
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,713
Mongo is her. . . 
is that. . .

555
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:26,051
Mongo. 
That's short for ''mongoloid.''

556
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:31,260
Is that what you call her? Or that's. . .
What is that? A nickname?

557
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:33,899
She got Down's syndrome.

558
00:45:42,108 --> 00:45:43,075
How you doing, Precious?

559
00:45:43,142 --> 00:45:45,736
My grandmother Toosie
bring little Mongo over to our house

560
00:45:45,812 --> 00:45:50,146
on days when the social worker come,
so it look like she live with us.

561
00:45:51,651 --> 00:45:53,710
Answer the fucking door.

562
00:45:55,388 --> 00:45:57,618
Do you see what you did? God damn it.

563
00:45:57,724 --> 00:46:00,989
Then my mother gets money
and the food stamps for me and Mongo.

564
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,493
Who is it?

565
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:04,723
It's Ms. Turner.

566
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:06,789
Social worker's here.

567
00:46:06,899 --> 00:46:10,596
Why didn't you tell me that bitch
was coming so fucking early?

568
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:13,332
My fucking wig. 
Come get my wig!

569
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:14,770
Come up!

570
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:21,343
Where's my lipstick?

571
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:27,746
Thank you, thank you.

572
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:40,929
- Get off of me.
- Leave that child alone, please.

573
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,195
Mind your goddamn business.

574
00:46:45,104 --> 00:46:47,095
- Hi, Precious.

575
00:46:47,507 --> 00:46:50,305

576
00:46:50,376 --> 00:46:53,641
Please excuse that.
My sweet grandbaby just knocked it over.

577
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:56,011

Excuse the mess.

578
00:46:56,115 --> 00:46:57,639
- Thank you.
- Than ks.

579
00:46:57,717 --> 00:46:58,979
How are you, Mary?

580
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:02,044
I'm doing really good, Ms. Turner.
Thank you .

581
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:05,449
When was the last time
you've taken her to the doctor?

582
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:08,891
Precious, when. . .
When did we take her? The baby?

583

On the 16th. Yes, yes, ma'am.

585
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:16,693
Okay, and what did the doctor say?

586
00:47:19,305 --> 00:47:22,240
They said
that she's progressing really good.

587
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:24,139
She's doing really good.

588
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,371
- That's good .
- Yes, ma'am.

589
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:28,208
And have you been looking for a job?

590
00:47:28,314 --> 00:47:32,580
I have, Ms. Turner. i am.
But they've all been saying the same thing.

591
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:36,177
You know, they'll call me back.
They'll get back to me.

592
00:47:38,558 --> 00:47:40,685
When did you go looking for the job?

593
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,924

and i filled out several applications.

594
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:48,728
And they all said the same thing,

595
00:47:50,837 --> 00:47:52,099

615
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:54,498
Moving all around and shit
while I'm trying to talk to this bitch.

616
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,500
Makes me fucking itch.

617
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,568
She done threw her fucking candy
on the floor.

618
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,164
Goddamn animal.

619
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,938
And now you gonna give it to her?
put the fucking candy back on the floor!

620
00:49:07,013 --> 00:49:08,571
Then you go and pick it up
and let her have it.

621
00:49:08,648 --> 00:49:11,845
You're so fucking stupid.
Just like her dumb ass.

622
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:15,648
That bitch gonna come up in here
and I gotta fucking make pretend?

623
00:49:15,755 --> 00:49:17,086
I'm so sick of it.

624
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:19,624
I don't know what the fuck
you shaking your head for.

625
00:49:19,692 --> 00:49:21,159
You didn't do no goddamn better.

626
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,319
You know what?
Let's talk about your father.

627
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:25,863
Tell me about your relationship with him.

628
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:28,433
I don't know much more
than you do, Ms. White.

629

638
00:49:50,122 --> 00:49:51,953
- I don't care, honey.

639
00:49:52,024 --> 00:49:53,616
- I need to know this.
- Let's move on.

640
00:49:53,693 --> 00:49:55,058
I need to know this to help you.

641
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:58,153
- Bitch, can we change the subject?
- Okay.

642
00:49:58,231 --> 00:50:01,394
Well, I'll see you next time, then.
Or maybe you'll see someone else.

643
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:06,063
But you're gonna have to talk to somebody
if you want your check, sweetie.

644
00:50:16,315 --> 00:50:18,340
I see vampires, too.

645
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:24,520
They come at night.
They tell me I'm one of them.

646
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:29,020
They say, ''Precious, you belong with us.''

647
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,921
And then they go downstairs
through the floor.

648
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:36,866
The people that live under us,
they is vampires,

649
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:39,268
so that's where they should go.

650
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,000
They be so nasty, though,

651
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:44,440
leaving their dirty tampons and shit
in the garbage.

652
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:46,944
Don't even offer to take it out.

653
00:50:47,046 --> 00:50:49,571
They got no fucking home training.

654
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:56,384
I been going to the doctor, too. 
It's nice.

Don't know how i had my first baby
on the kitchen floor

657
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:10,702
with my momma kicking me
upside my head .

658
00:51:13,372 --> 00:51:14,737

you're talking about

659
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:17,640
when you say,
say whatever come to my mind?

660
00:51:22,214 --> 00:51:24,944
That's the end of them welfare checks.

661
00:51:25,051 --> 00:51:29,078
I just couldn't lie no more.
I shouldn't have said none of that.

662
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,422
Momma gonna kill me.

663
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:44,827
Motherfuckers!

I'm not doing this with you today.

666
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:54,673
At night, we went out on a field trip.

667
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:01,786
These girls is crazy.

668
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:05,521
Ain't nobody ever grabbed my hand
like that before.

669
00:52:22,274 --> 00:52:24,708
...as a candidate
for the Democratic nomination

670
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,802
for the presidency
of the United States of America.

671
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:32,212
...and by having destroyed it,
now we don't know. . .

672
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,557
...and the testimony you're about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth. . .

673
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,524
I still have a dream.

674
00:52:43,362 --> 00:52:46,991
It is a dream deeply rooted
in the American dream.

675
00:52:48,234 --> 00:52:52,000
I have a dream that one day

676

and live out the true meaning of. . .

I'm gonna teach my baby all of this.

678
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,006
''We hold these truths to be self- evident,

679
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:06,176
''that all men are created equal. ''

680
00:53:06,252 --> 00:53:08,516
No fear. That's bullshit. That's bullshit.

681

00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:22,928
Yes, but i don't know what to do.

00:53:23,035 --> 00:53:26,061
All right, pull it together. Okay.

''And how Lord Jesus, Son of God, Messiah,
Jehovah delivers.''

698
00:53:52,965 --> 00:53:54,956
Is that a fairytale?

699
00:53:56,535 --> 00:53:57,866
Sit down.

700
00:53:57,937 --> 00:53:59,234
Did anybody do this assign ment?

701
00:53:59,305 --> 00:54:01,796
Momma say this school ain't shit.

702
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:04,375
She say you can't learn nothing
writing in no book.

703
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:09,642
- This is a fairytale called ''Enchanted.''
- She wrong about that. I is learning.

704
00:54:12,418 --> 00:54:15,876
''Once upon a time, in a faraway land,

named Joan n- a.

big and small .

''Except for one idiot boy
who was so stupid and dumb.

''And out of all the cute boys who loved her,
he was the cutest one.''

710
00:54:39,678 --> 00:54:42,977
- That's all I got so far.
- That's a good beginning.

711
00:54:43,082 --> 00:54:46,609
Thinking about little Mongo, too. 
I miss her.

712
00:54:46,986 --> 00:54:48,453
That's how you start a fairytale.

713

I'm happy my baby coming up.

714

The food in this hospital's nasty.

It's not from here.

725

Where it from?

726
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:22,036
A little shop by my house where

I get my organic food ,
so i don't have to eat that

Can you bring me something?
I don't like fruit. I like McDonald's.

730
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:32,584
First of all , 
I don't eat McDonald's.

731
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:35,353
Second of all, you don't need
to be eating McDonald's, either.

732
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:36,451
It's not healthy.

733
00:56:36,562 --> 00:56:38,757
But I like McDonald's.
We all like McDonald's, right?

734
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:41,458
We like McDonald's, too, over here.

you go with all your little friends,

739
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:51,776
and you go to McDonald's,

740
00:56:51,877 --> 00:56:53,742
and you get as much
McDonald's as you want.

741
00:56:53,812 --> 00:56:56,280
But right now,
you're gonna take care of your health.

- You've never seen a male nurse?
- No.

749
00:57:13,332 --> 00:57:15,425
Not looking like you do.

Tough gal like you had to scream?

757
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:35,115
Not so tough with a baby coming out of me.
It hurt. And it burned.

You don't want her, right?

764

Use that for Nurse John.

Yes, because they all trying
to take your money.

Tell me what you see back there.

863
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:55,364
I could tell by Ms. Rain's face
I ain't gonna be homeless no more.

864
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,466
I just don't know
where I'm gonna end up, though.

865
01:09:57,577 --> 01:09:59,135
I'll hold.

866
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,809
I feel bad for her.

867

She just an ABC teacher.
She ain't no social worker.

868

What's going on?

869

But she all i could think of.

Look, when the others get here,
tell them to start writing .

871
01:10:13,426 --> 01:10:15,587
And whichever one of you is older
is in charge, okay?

872
01:10:15,661 --> 01:10:17,322
Consuelo, I know that's not you.
Come here.

873
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,557
Ms. Rain , I can't stay. I'm serious.
I've tried to talk. . .

874
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,226
Consuelo, you're not leaving class
and I'm not dealing with this right now.

875
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,633
Take this money.
Go get something for Precious to wear.

876
01:10:24,737 --> 01:10:27,171
Quick. And bring back my change.

877
01:10:27,273 --> 01:10:30,970
Sixteen years old. 
A three-day-old infant.

878
01:10:31,611 --> 01:10:33,738
The baby not bleeding.
I think this is Precious' blood.

879
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,680
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?

880
01:10:38,017 --> 01:10:40,485
We'll find you a place to live.

881
01:10:43,689 --> 01:10:45,418
Joann , you're late.

882
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,686
Rhonda, you ain't the teacher.

883
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:50,159
Joann, Ms. Rain is busy
with Precious today,

884
01:10:50,262 --> 01:10:52,355
so i am the teacher today.

885
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:54,330
Okay. Why?

886
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,529
- Where's Preoious?
- Just sit. Pull out your notebook.

887
01:10:56,636 --> 01:10:59,036
Joann, you wanna say one of your raps
to the baby?

888
01:10:59,138 --> 01:11:00,537
What's the baby doing here?

889
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,335
- Joann's gonna rap for you.
- Let me see.

890
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:04,839
She all right. 
She's doing good.

891
01:11:05,544 --> 01:11:08,513
Why is the baby wrapped up
in a blood-covered blanket?

892
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:11,344
- Joann, what's so funny?
- For real. What happened?

893
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:12,849
You don't wanna know is
how it got on the blanket.

894
01:11:12,952 --> 01:11:14,010
You know what your problem is, Joann?

895
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,883
That you can't take anything
serious enough.

896
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:18,388
- Jermaine, me expect better from you.
- Okay, Rhonda.

897
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:21,016
Joann, stop laughing at this baby.

898
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:23,992
Queens.

899
01:11:26,332 --> 01:11:28,061
Let me call you back.

900
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:29,464
Just tell me what happened!

901
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,866
No, it's not funny.

902
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:33,803
But Joann, there's nothing funny
about a baby with blood on it.

903
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,670
I got a West indian friend
who's a Council member.

904
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:37,868
Let me see what she can do.
Hold on a second.

905
01:11:37,977 --> 01:11:41,242

Hey, Ms. Lisa. 
How you been?

I went to see that movie, Barfly, last night.

910
01:11:53,926 --> 01:11:57,054
- I'm sorry.
- It's on my desk. Can you hold?

911
01:11:57,163 --> 01:11:59,427
Something's wrong with you, Precious.

912
01:11:59,532 --> 01:12:01,056
This baby stink.

913
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:03,431
Well, we don't have a pamper,
so have a seat with the baby.

914
01:12:03,536 --> 01:12:06,198
- I am sitting.
- In your seat, please.

915
01:12:06,272 --> 01:12:08,365
The first thing

916
01:12:08,441 --> 01:12:14,107
is shut the bumba-ros-clot. . .

917
01:12:15,014 --> 01:12:17,505
Ms. Rain , why did you let Rhonda
teach the class?

918
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,210
She don't even know how to speak English.

919
01:12:19,285 --> 01:12:20,343
Let Rhonda take over.

920
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:24,048
- Shut the bumba-ros-clot up.
- What the fuck is a ''ros clot''?

921
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:26,057
Yeah, Brenda, you there?

922
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,719

924
01:12:31,464 --> 01:12:33,591
- Rita?

925
01:12:33,699 --> 01:12:36,566
- Anybody know how to spell ''Aquarius''?

Can you spell ''boy'' then?

927
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,199
Can you spell ''slut'' then?

928
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:40,898
Let's explore that.

929
01:12:40,973 --> 01:12:44,306
You wanna spell ''slut,'' Consuelo,
I'll give you the first letter.

930
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:46,537
Can you spell ''illegal immigrant,'' then?

931
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,637
Great, thank you.

932
01:12:50,249 --> 01:12:52,740
Can you please use ''slut'' in a sentence?

933
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:54,217
Consuelo is a slut. . .

934
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:57,084
- You the one who's the ho up in here. . .
- Joann is not a slut.

935
01:12:57,156 --> 01:12:59,556
perfect. You get a gold star.

936
01:13:01,393 --> 01:13:03,088
But you know she likes that.

937
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:05,460
Well, she's just insecure.

938
01:13:05,564 --> 01:13:07,156
- You think?
- Yeah.

939
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:11,261
- That chicken was good.
- Really good. Did you have enough?

940
01:13:11,337 --> 01:13:13,271
There ain't more, is there?

941
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:15,000
- Is there more?
- Yeah.

942
01:13:15,341 --> 01:13:17,639
Maybe later. Not now.

943
01:13:17,743 --> 01:13:19,677
I don't want you to think I'm greedy.

944
01:13:19,779 --> 01:13:22,111
You're not greedy.
If you're hungry, let's get you some more.

945
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:25,344
I guess i kind of eat
too much sometimes, though.

946
01:13:25,451 --> 01:13:26,679
No, you don't.

947
01:13:26,786 --> 01:13:28,651
- Blu, is that you?
- Not always.

948
01:13:28,754 --> 01:13:30,813
What are you doing here?

949
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:33,952
I live here. 
Why didn't you tell me?

950
01:13:34,026 --> 01:13:36,824
- Hey, sweetie.
- Is this. . . Is this. . .

951
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:40,625
This is Katherine, Precious.

952
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:42,758
- Are you okay?
- It's so nice to meet you , finally.

953
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:46,271
Oh, my God. 
These straight-up lesbians.

954
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:49,933
- This is Abdul.
- He's gorgeous. He looks just like you.

955
01:13:50,976 --> 01:13:52,307
Precious, can i hold him?

956
01:13:52,378 --> 01:13:54,141
You know how to?

957
01:13:54,213 --> 01:13:56,204
They stilinlce enough
to let us stay in their home

958
01:13:56,315 --> 01:13:58,647
until i get situated, though.

959
01:13:58,717 --> 01:14:02,813
- He's heavy. Oh, my God!
- You wanna hold him?

960
01:14:02,888 --> 01:14:05,379
I guess this is how the peoples
on TV feel at Christmas time.

961
01:14:05,491 --> 01:14:08,051
- Don't drop him.
- Come on. I only work with children.

962
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,184
You know how you are. 
I saw you. . .

963
01:14:09,295 --> 01:14:11,320
When we were putting up the tree,
you dropped half the top of it.

964
01:14:11,397 --> 01:14:12,989
They're so nice to me and Abdul.

965
01:14:13,065 --> 01:14:15,158
- Be careful. Hold him with both hands.
- please.

966
01:14:15,234 --> 01:14:16,963
Oh, Abdul.

967
01:14:18,904 --> 01:14:21,065
Merry Christmas, Precious.

968
01:14:21,907 --> 01:14:23,033
Thank you.

969
01:14:23,142 --> 01:14:24,473
Why peoples that barely know me

970
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:27,876
should be nicer to me
than my mother and my father?

971
01:14:28,514 --> 01:14:29,913
I felt warm.

972
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:31,477
- What?
- I'm just. . .

973
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,713
I'm just concerned about the baby
and the cats upstairs.

974
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:35,980
They're fine.

975
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:38,046
Grandmother's scared of Momma.

976
01:14:38,157 --> 01:14:40,557
I know that's why
she ain't letting me stay with her.

977
01:14:40,659 --> 01:14:42,559
If Ronald McDonald were running things. . .

978
01:14:42,661 --> 01:14:45,425
Ms. Rain say don't be afraid of nothing.

979
01:14:46,098 --> 01:14:48,566
I bet she ain't scared of Momma.

980
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:51,261
Wouldn't you be a little bit suspicious?

981
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,598
Just write the book.

982
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:55,936
- Well, who's gonna read it?
- Nobody, if you don't write it.

983
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:59,568
You know, Precious writes every day.
You should try it.

984
01:14:59,678 --> 01:15:02,909
Is that right?
What do you write about, Precious?

985
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:04,944
Stuff.

986
01:15:06,051 --> 01:15:08,451
My life. Abdul.

987
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:13,051
How come y'all don't like McDonald's?

988
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:14,956
Katherine was just drawing a comparison

989
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:17,119
so that her point could be
more easily understood.

990
01:15:17,229 --> 01:15:18,218
Yes.

991
01:15:18,297 --> 01:15:20,788
They talk like TV channels i don't watch.

992
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,265
My Uncle Clayton.

993
01:15:22,368 --> 01:15:25,804
I'm glad Abdul here to listen in on them,
though, 'cause I know they're smart.

994
01:15:25,905 --> 01:15:27,304
Before he got saved,

995
01:15:27,406 --> 01:15:30,068
he used to smoke like a chimney
and drink like a fish.

996
01:15:30,142 --> 01:15:32,201
I don't understand a 
word they're saying.

997
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,870
You understand?

998
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:38,916
Y'all be watching Oprah?

999
01:15:38,984 --> 01:15:41,919
No. I don't, actually.
You know what time i get home from work.

1000
01:15:41,987 --> 01:15:45,115
- I watch it.
- Momma say homos is bad peoples.

1001
01:15:45,824 --> 01:15:48,258
But Momma,
homos not ones who raped me.

1002
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:50,625
And what do that make you?

1003
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:54,825
Homos not ones who let me sit in class
all them years and never learn nothing.

1004
01:15:54,934 --> 01:15:57,801
The homos not ones who sell crack
to peoples in Harlem.

1005
01:15:57,903 --> 01:15:59,894
- . . .that I have ever seen. Tell her!
- That doesn't work.

1006
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,566
I wonder what Oprah got to say about that.

1007
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:05,007
Ms. Rain is the one
who put the chalk in my hand,

1008
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:07,578
made me queen of the ABC's.

1009
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:12,450
After I settled at the halfway house,

1010
01:16:12,518 --> 01:16:14,952
I worked my hardest
to memorize letter sounds,

1011
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:18,012
writing in the journal,
and reading smaller and fatter books.

1012
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:21,354
Then I found out the Mayor's office
give me a literacy award

1013
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,189
and a check for progress.

1014
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:27,360
One, two, three.

1015
01:16:27,466 --> 01:16:29,195
The party is on.

1016
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:30,866
Go, Joann!

1017
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:36,266
Let me see what you got!

1018
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:41,439
Everybody come. Nurse John, Cornrows,
all the staff was out there.

1019
01:16:41,981 --> 01:16:44,211
Even Ms. Katherine showed up.

1020
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:45,847
Precious.

1021
01:16:49,054 --> 01:16:50,487
What's up?

1022
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:52,480
What's that?

1023
01:16:53,058 --> 01:16:54,719
What does it look like?

1024
01:16:54,827 --> 01:16:56,727
plastic stupid apple.

1025
01:16:59,898 --> 01:17:01,559
A little something for you.

1026
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:04,363
- Is there more money in it?
- You're so greedy.

1027
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:07,200
Yo, who's that?

1028
01:17:10,142 --> 01:17:11,370
What?

1029
01:17:14,246 --> 01:17:16,237
- What?
- Come on.

1030
01:17:16,749 --> 01:17:19,217
Precious, where are you taking me?

1031
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:24,349
What am i supposed to do, diva? Yeah?
Wait a minute. Hold on, girl.

1032
01:17:24,423 --> 01:17:25,981
Yeah. . .

1033
01:17:30,162 --> 01:17:32,255
My mom called last night.

1034
01:17:34,933 --> 01:17:38,232
And we don't really have a relationship.

1035
01:17:38,704 --> 01:17:41,537
We don't talk,
because she really has a problem with. . .

1036
01:17:41,607 --> 01:17:45,373
Some folks got a light around them
that shine for other peoples.

1037
01:17:45,444 --> 01:17:48,538
I think maybe some 
of them was in tunnels,

1038
01:17:48,614 --> 01:17:51,344
and in that tunnel,
maybe the only light they had

1039
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,941
was inside of them.

1040
01:17:53,052 --> 01:17:56,283
Then i thought about how strong
you've had to be.

1041
01:17:58,891 --> 01:18:02,622
And then,
even long after they escaped that tunnel. . .

1042
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:06,795
- I'll help you clean up.
- Okay.

1043
01:18:07,466 --> 01:18:10,458
... they still be shining for everybody else.

1044
01:18:14,706 --> 01:18:16,731
That's Ms. Rain to me.

1045
01:18:19,711 --> 01:18:21,235
''Awar d for Outstanding Achievement.''

1046
01:18:21,313 --> 01:18:24,942
In a book I read,
this lady escaped to a halfway house.

1047
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,244
And when she was there,

1048
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:29,253
she asked the people there
what a halfway house was.

1049
01:18:29,321 --> 01:18:33,655
They told her it was halfway between
her old life and where she wanna be.

1050
01:18:33,759 --> 01:18:35,659
That's kind of nice.

1051
01:18:37,329 --> 01:18:40,423
That also mean 
i can't stay here forever.

1052
01:18:40,499 --> 01:18:42,660
There's still a way to go.

1053
01:18:43,402 --> 01:18:46,337
It'd be something to 
get my own apartment.

1054
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:50,664
Abdul nine months and almost walking.
He's smart, too.

1055
01:18:51,343 --> 01:18:54,437
I've been reading to him
since the day he was born.

1056
01:18:54,513 --> 01:18:57,573
He's barely talking,
but he's already counting.

1057
01:18:58,517 --> 01:19:00,348
Momma, Daddy,

1058
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:05,523
IS 1 1 1, 4 4 4 Lenox all seem
like some old, bad dream.

1059
01:19:07,693 --> 01:19:11,686
I wish i could've just started out here,
but still with Abdul.

1060
01:19:13,132 --> 01:19:17,296
I'm gonna get Mongo, too.
I gotta get Mongo back.

1061
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:20,463
Hey, Miss Cassidy.

1062
01:19:20,539 --> 01:19:22,769
Hey, Precious,
somebody downstairs for you.

1063
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,604
- Who is It?
- I didn't ask who it was.

1064
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:25,870
You want me to watch the baby?

1065
01:19:25,978 --> 01:19:28,845
No, I gotta go down 
and get him anyway.

1066
01:20:03,248 --> 01:20:04,909
Your daddy dead.

1067
01:20:06,852 --> 01:20:08,319
That's all?

1068
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,257
He had that AIDS virus.

1069
01:20:30,776 --> 01:20:32,038
There you go, 
dreaming again.

1070
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:34,772
Precious, do you hear me talking to you?

1071
01:20:36,215 --> 01:20:37,341
Did you hear what i said?

1072
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:43,720
You got it?

1073
01:20:44,957 --> 01:20:46,584
Got what?

1074
01:20:46,692 --> 01:20:48,626
- The AIDS virus.
- No.

1075
01:20:49,628 --> 01:20:51,289
How do you know?

1076
01:20:51,396 --> 01:20:54,263
We never did it up in the ass, 
so i know.

1077
01:20:58,637 --> 01:21:01,105
You better get to a doctor, Mom.

1078
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:05,538
You coming home?

1079
01:21:22,494 --> 01:21:23,984
Yo, Preoious!

1080
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:45,640
Rita, what do i mean 
when i say the author

1081
01:21:45,751 --> 01:21:50,415
descri bes her protagonist's circumstances
as ''unrelenting''?

1082
01:21:51,423 --> 01:21:53,755
I don't know. 
I don't know.

1083
01:21:56,128 --> 01:21:59,689
It's like, say, like if Rita,
she tries to do something,

1084
01:21:59,798 --> 01:22:02,266
and she's going and she's going,
and me, I try to stop her

1085
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,962
and she no stop, she keep on going.

1086
01:22:05,604 --> 01:22:07,367
Relentless-un.

1087
01:23:00,092 --> 01:23:02,560
I'll see you tonight. 
Bye.

1088
01:23:51,643 --> 01:23:53,133
Come with me.

1089
01:23:54,579 --> 01:23:55,978
Precious?

1090
01:23:57,816 --> 01:23:59,283
Excuse me?

1091
01:24:01,219 --> 01:24:03,312
Nurse say I'm HIV positive.

1092
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,486
I ain't got nothing to write today.

1093
01:24:14,332 --> 01:24:15,993
Is your baby okay?

1094
01:24:17,068 --> 01:24:20,435
He all right.
I just got to stop breastfeeding him.

1095
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:26,303
Remember, you once told me

1096
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:29,679
you never really got to tell your story.

1097
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,174
- Write.
- Fuck you!

1098
01:24:33,685 --> 01:24:36,677
You know nothing
of what I've been through.

1099
01:24:37,856 --> 01:24:40,188
I ain't never had no boyfriend.

1100
01:24:42,861 --> 01:24:45,455
My daddy said he gonna marry me.

1101
01:24:46,131 --> 01:24:49,430
How he gonna do that?
It would fucking be illegal!

1102
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:06,878
Write.

1103
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,545
I'm tired, Ms. Rain.

1104
01:25:12,457 --> 01:25:15,620
If not for yourself,
then for the people who love you.

1105
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,491
Nobody loves me.

1106
01:25:17,562 --> 01:25:19,826
people do love you, Precious.

1107
01:25:20,298 --> 01:25:22,732
please don't lie to me, Ms. Rain.

1108
01:25:23,568 --> 01:25:25,968
Love ain't done nothing for me.

1109
01:25:27,005 --> 01:25:30,406
Love beat me, raped me,

1110
01:25:31,843 --> 01:25:35,836
called me an animal,
make me feel worthless.

1111
01:25:36,515 --> 01:25:38,073
Make me sick.

1112
01:25:40,418 --> 01:25:42,511
That wasn't love, Precious.

1113
01:25:44,589 --> 01:25:46,420
Your baby loves you.

1114
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:51,195
I love you.

1115
01:25:58,503 --> 01:25:59,731
Write.

1116
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,614
What are you thinking?

1117
01:26:12,784 --> 01:26:17,016
You never told me about
your relationship with your mother.

1118
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:21,419
I didn't, did i?

1119
01:26:22,127 --> 01:26:24,721
Really, I'm here to help you.

1120
01:26:24,796 --> 01:26:27,959
You can talk to me.
This is a safe environment.

1121
01:26:29,301 --> 01:26:30,700
You're right.

1122
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:33,294
We could talk about your daddy instead.

1123
01:26:33,405 --> 01:26:36,238
We could talk about my mother, my father,

1124
01:26:36,308 --> 01:26:40,711
my aunts or my sister or my brother,
but none of it's gonna help you.

1125
01:26:41,379 --> 01:26:42,869
You don't even like me.

1126
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:45,974
Have we not been in this room together

1127
01:26:46,084 --> 01:26:49,315
for, like, a year, discussing your life?

1128
01:26:49,421 --> 01:26:52,413
Does that mean we like each other,
because we discuss my life?

1129
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:53,957
I can't speak for you.

1130
01:26:54,059 --> 01:26:58,496
I can only speak for me,
and I do like you. I do.

1131
01:26:59,164 --> 01:27:00,995
So, are you Italian, or. . .

1132
01:27:01,099 --> 01:27:02,396
What color are you , anyway?

1133
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,560
Are you some type of black or Spanish?

1134
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,831
What color do you think i am?

1135
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:12,140
No, I'd like to know.
What color do you think i am?

1136
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,673
My throat is dry.

1137
01:27:15,513 --> 01:27:17,276
Your throat is dry?

1138
01:27:17,682 --> 01:27:19,411
It's really hot in here.

1139
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,577
It is kind of hot in here.

1140
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,987
I'm gonna go get a soda.
What do you want?

1141
01:27:25,357 --> 01:27:27,188
Soda sounds fine.

1142
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:28,691
All right.

1143
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:00,714
Thank you.

1144
01:28:01,326 --> 01:28:02,793
No problem.

1145
01:28:06,498 --> 01:28:09,695
So, I have to talk to 
you about your mother,

1146
01:28:10,235 --> 01:28:12,567
and I don't know
how you're gonna feel about this,

1147
01:28:12,671 --> 01:28:15,401
but she says she wants to see you

1148
01:28:15,507 --> 01:28:20,137
and she wants to be reunited
with you and her grandchildren.

1149
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:23,681
She wants to come
and have a session here with you.

1150
01:28:23,748 --> 01:28:25,340
What did you tell her?

1151
01:28:25,417 --> 01:28:28,250
I said i had to speak to you about it.

1152
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,322
It's up to you.

1153
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,359
I don't know.
I never thought about it before.

1154
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,386
Ms. Weiss said in that file I got HIV.

1155
01:28:39,497 --> 01:28:41,897
She said I was supposed to die from it.

1156
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,025
I ain't worried about dying.

1157
01:28:44,102 --> 01:28:48,061
Shit, I gotta worry about
how I'm supposed to raise these kids.

1158
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:51,565
I was just writing, like, about. . .

1159
01:28:52,277 --> 01:28:54,370
I wanna open up this clinic

1160
01:28:54,446 --> 01:28:57,677
about, like, mothers and their children.

1161
01:28:58,516 --> 01:29:01,542
You know, just,
if they're sick or something like that.

1162
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:05,282
I always wanted to do that,
give back to the community.

1163
01:29:05,390 --> 01:29:08,257
Because I know my mom would be
proud of me if i did that,

1164
01:29:08,359 --> 01:29:10,020
and my children, too.

1165
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:13,792
I want my children to be proud
of their mother, you know?

1166
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:19,461
- That's always what I wanted to do, so. . .
- That's good. That's really nice.

1167
01:29:23,074 --> 01:29:27,534
I don't really want to read the whole thing,
I kind of just wanna say what it's about.

1168
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:32,409
Okay, the counselors
at Advanoement House,

1169
01:29:34,252 --> 01:29:36,743
they were quizzing me
about my mother and my father, right?

1170
01:29:36,821 --> 01:29:38,584
But it's not really about them.

1171
01:29:38,656 --> 01:29:40,749
They're trying to get me to do workfare.

1172
01:29:40,825 --> 01:29:43,225
- They want me to be a home attendant.
- How do you know?

1173
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:45,592
Because I stole my file and I read it.

1174
01:29:45,663 --> 01:29:47,597
All they want me to do is work.

1175
01:29:47,665 --> 01:29:50,930
Now, I do wanna work,
but not for no welfare check.

1176
01:29:51,002 --> 01:29:52,435
What kind of sense that make,

1177
01:29:52,504 --> 01:29:55,439
for somebody like Precious to quit school
before she got her GED

1178
01:29:55,507 --> 01:29:58,135
and go work
for some old white people somewhere?

1179
01:29:58,243 --> 01:30:01,303
She ain't never gonna be nothing
if she gets stuck in some shit like that.

1180
01:30:01,412 --> 01:30:02,902
Rhonda used to home attend.

1181
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:05,973
She used to have to go all the way out
to Brighton Beach.

1182
01:30:06,084 --> 01:30:09,417
Yeah, okay, Rhonda would be
working there all day and night.

1183
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,512
She'd be on call, right?

1184
01:30:11,956 --> 01:30:16,154
She made $6.37 an hour,
but for only eight hours.

1185
01:30:16,761 --> 01:30:18,854
That equal out to $50.96.

1186
01:30:19,864 --> 01:30:21,297
But that's not a whole lot of money,

1187
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:24,494
especially 'cause,
for real, she there for 24 hours.

1188
01:30:24,602 --> 01:30:29,301
So, $50.96 divided by 24

1189
01:30:29,374 --> 01:30:33,310
is $2.12 an hour. 
That's not a lot of money.

1190
01:30:33,378 --> 01:30:37,781
She said that old bitch would ring a bell,
like, a real-life, actual bell

1191
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:39,680
when she wanted something from her
in the middle of the night.

1192
01:30:39,784 --> 01:30:42,480
- You don't want to do that shit.
- Rhonda, is that true? Rhonda!

1193
01:30:42,554 --> 01:30:45,614
Them home attendants be working for, like,
six days a week.

1194
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:49,558
I'd only see Abdul on Sunday.
plus, I'd have to leave class.

1195
01:30:49,894 --> 01:30:53,193
Well, that's not an option.
You're not leaving class.

1196
01:30:53,298 --> 01:30:56,392
plus, I'm gonna start going to
insect survivor meetings.

1197
01:30:56,501 --> 01:30:57,991
It's ''incest.''

1198
01:30:59,737 --> 01:31:02,900
- That ain't what i said?
- No, you said ''insect.''

1199
01:31:03,508 --> 01:31:04,805
What's the difference?

1200
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,673
Well, one's where your family molests you,

1201
01:31:06,744 --> 01:31:09,406
the other's like a roach or bugs.

1202
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:14,711
- So, you a scientist now?
- I'm just saying.

1203
01:31:14,819 --> 01:31:17,583
No, that's cool. 
Thank you. Thank you.

1204
01:31:23,761 --> 01:31:27,356
It was hard telling them strangers there
what my father did.

1205
01:31:27,432 --> 01:31:29,423
Sometimes it felt good.

1206
01:31:34,706 --> 01:31:38,904
Last week, Ms. Rain asked us
to write down what we wanna be like.

1207
01:31:39,344 --> 01:31:42,871
I wrote that I be real skinny,

1208
01:31:43,615 --> 01:31:45,845
with light skin and long hair.

1209
01:31:47,285 --> 01:31:48,946
Loretha Holloway?

1210
01:31:50,188 --> 01:31:51,280
Go on back there.

1211
01:31:51,389 --> 01:31:53,220
She read it and said 
I'm beautifuI like i am.

1212
01:31:53,291 --> 01:31:56,783
But, there's no kids back there
for me to play with.

1213
01:31:58,963 --> 01:32:00,931
Just shut up and sit there, then.

1214
01:32:01,032 --> 01:32:04,399
Gonna talk to this lady
before my shit gets cut off.

1215
01:32:04,469 --> 01:32:05,936
But somehow,

1216
01:32:07,071 --> 01:32:10,302
right now. . . 
And I don't know why, but. . .

1217
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:14,206
I think she right.

1218
01:32:20,585 --> 01:32:21,643
Here.

1219
01:32:30,328 --> 01:32:31,955
Claireece Jones?

1220
01:32:37,936 --> 01:32:39,927
I think she right.

1221
01:32:45,176 --> 01:32:47,269
Okay, Mrs. Johnston ,
let's talk about the abuse.

1222
01:32:47,345 --> 01:32:49,575
There were no drugs in my house.

1223
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:51,615
I didn't play that.
There weren't no drugs in my house.

1224
01:32:51,683 --> 01:32:53,344
Precious knew i would whup her ass

1225
01:32:53,451 --> 01:32:54,941
if she gonna bring some drugs
up in my house.

1226
01:32:55,019 --> 01:32:57,419
You know what I'm talking about.

1227
01:32:58,523 --> 01:33:03,688
I'm referring to specific
sexual and physical acts

1228
01:33:04,262 --> 01:33:06,025
involving Precious.

1229
01:33:06,698 --> 01:33:08,689
Why you ain't say that?

1230
01:33:09,434 --> 01:33:11,026
Yes, that.

1231
01:33:13,104 --> 01:33:15,004
What do you wanna know?

1232
01:33:15,106 --> 01:33:17,097
According to Precious' files,

1233
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:21,202
she has now had two children
by your boyfriend,

1234
01:33:21,312 --> 01:33:25,544
the late Carl Kenwood Jones,
who was also her father.

1235
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,847
- Yeah.
- This is accurate?

1236
01:33:36,294 --> 01:33:38,057
Yes, Ms. Weiss.

1237
01:33:38,563 --> 01:33:41,657
I need to know why you're here.
You've been calling this office

1238
01:33:41,733 --> 01:33:45,669
saying you want to be reunited
with Precious and your grandchild.

1239
01:33:45,737 --> 01:33:49,229
Now, I really need to know
what's gone on in that home.

1240
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:51,467
Ms. Weiss,
I understand we need to discuss it,

1241
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:52,873
but I'm just telling you.

1242
01:33:52,977 --> 01:33:55,707
You said I've been calling here
and I've been wanting to see

1243
01:33:55,813 --> 01:33:57,246
Precious and my grandson.

1244
01:33:57,348 --> 01:34:01,842
You're goddamn right I wanna see them.
Because they belong to me. Okay?

1245
01:34:01,919 --> 01:34:04,979
Now, there was a time
Precious had everything,

1246
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,853
and i done told her that.

1247
01:34:06,924 --> 01:34:10,553
And me and Carl, we loved Precious.
And you need to know that.

1248
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:13,357
We loved Precious and we had dreams.

1249
01:34:13,431 --> 01:34:18,164
Precious was born around the same time
Ms. West's son got killed.

1250
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:23,606
The summer time.
She was born in the summer time.

1251
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:25,699
Remember? 
Remember that?

1252
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:27,944
I was born in November.

1253
01:34:28,446 --> 01:34:30,004
November.

1254
01:34:30,882 --> 01:34:33,350
Yeah, that's right.

1255
01:34:34,619 --> 01:34:36,519
My Scorpio child.

1256
01:34:38,689 --> 01:34:40,122
You know. . .

1257
01:34:40,858 --> 01:34:44,885
Scorpios, they can be tricky.

1258
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:50,625
And, I'm not saying that they lie.
I'm not saying that.

1259
01:34:51,202 --> 01:34:53,534
But you just gotta watch them.

1260
01:34:57,475 --> 01:35:01,275
Can we talk about the actual acts

1261
01:35:01,379 --> 01:35:04,075
of physical and sexual abuse

1262
01:35:04,148 --> 01:35:06,616
that occurred in your household?

1263
01:35:07,218 --> 01:35:08,742
When it first began,

1264
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:11,812
where it happened
and how did you respond?

1265
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:20,390
Precious was a little girl.

1266
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:24,825
Try and remember
how old you think she was.

1267
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,664
She was three.

1268
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:36,101
And I had been giving her the bottle

1269
01:35:38,015 --> 01:35:40,483
and I was giving Carl the tittie

1270
01:35:40,852 --> 01:35:44,913
because my milk hadn't dried up
in my breasts

1271
01:35:46,023 --> 01:35:49,356
but not from her, 
but because Carl was. . .

1272
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,462
Because Carl was sucking on them

1273
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:56,364
and that's what kept my milk in my breasts.

1274
01:35:59,103 --> 01:36:01,867
And I thought that 
that was for hygiene.

1275
01:36:02,807 --> 01:36:05,537
I did what my mother told me

1276
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:10,012
that I was supposed to do with my child,
so that's what i did.

1277
01:36:10,481 --> 01:36:13,143
And you're sitting up there
and you're trying to judge me. . .

1278
01:36:13,217 --> 01:36:16,050
I'm not judging you,
but you're asking me for money

1279
01:36:16,154 --> 01:36:18,554
and you're asking me
to be reunited with your grandson.

1280
01:36:18,656 --> 01:36:21,056
But, Ms. Weiss,
I don't like you looking at me like that.

1281
01:36:21,225 --> 01:36:24,683
You got this bitch looking at me
like I'm some kind of fucking monster.

1282
01:36:24,795 --> 01:36:26,695
We don't talk like 
this in my office, okay?

1283
01:36:26,797 --> 01:36:30,324
I didn't want her suoking behind him,
because that was nasty.

1284
01:36:30,401 --> 01:36:34,132
And things that he was. . .
It was just nasty, Ms. Weiss.

1285
01:36:39,744 --> 01:36:43,373
I had a man , 
and i have a child

1286
01:36:45,183 --> 01:36:49,017
and I had to take care of both of them.
Okay?

1287
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:55,682
Did i want Carl to touch my baby?

1288
01:36:57,762 --> 01:37:00,094
Because i would lay my baby.

1289
01:37:00,198 --> 01:37:04,828
I would lay her on the side of me,
on this pillow

1290
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:08,732
and it was pink

1291
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,500
and it had this little white writing on it

1292
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:16,707
and it had her name,
because she was Precious.

1293
01:37:17,615 --> 01:37:19,947
And i would lay my baby on that pillow

1294
01:37:20,051 --> 01:37:23,418
and Carl would be laying on the other side

1295
01:37:24,855 --> 01:37:28,723
and then we would . . .
We would start doing it

1296
01:37:28,793 --> 01:37:30,920
and he reached over

1297
01:37:33,231 --> 01:37:35,222
and he touched my baby.

1298
01:37:35,299 --> 01:37:36,857
And i asked him,

1299
01:37:37,635 --> 01:37:40,229
I said, 
''Carl, what are you doing?''

1300
01:37:40,304 --> 01:37:42,738
And he told me to shut. . .

1301
01:37:42,807 --> 01:37:45,799
To shut my fat ass up,
and it was good for her.

1302
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:49,141
- And what did you do then?
- I shut my fat ass up.

1303
01:37:49,647 --> 01:37:52,980
And I don't want you to sit there
and judge me, Ms. Weiss.

1304
01:37:53,084 --> 01:37:54,813
You shut up
and you let him abuse your daughter?

1305
01:37:54,919 --> 01:37:56,887
I did not want him 
to abuse my daughter.

1306
01:37:56,988 --> 01:37:58,455
- I did not want him to hurt her.
- But you allowed him

1307
01:37:58,556 --> 01:38:00,421
- to hurt her.
- I did not want him to do nothing to her.

1308
01:38:00,491 --> 01:38:02,425
I wanted him to make love to me.

1309
01:38:02,493 --> 01:38:05,485
That was my man.
That was my fucking man.

1310
01:38:05,663 --> 01:38:08,496
That was my man
and he wanted my daughter.

1311
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,098
And that's why i hated her.

1312
01:38:12,169 --> 01:38:15,161
Because my man,
who was supposed to be loving me,

1313
01:38:15,273 --> 01:38:18,106
who was supposed
to be making love to me,

1314
01:38:19,176 --> 01:38:21,440
was fucking my baby.

1315
01:38:21,512 --> 01:38:25,141
She made him leave.
She made him go away.

1316
01:38:25,683 --> 01:38:26,809
So, whose fault was it, then?

1317
01:38:26,917 --> 01:38:30,080
It's this bitch's fault
because she let my man have her

1318
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:31,746
and she didn't say nothing.

1319
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:33,813
She didn't scream. 
She didn't do nothing.

1320
01:38:33,924 --> 01:38:37,451
So, those things she told you 
I did to her,

1321
01:38:37,528 --> 01:38:40,691
who else was gonna love me?

1322
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:47,330
Since you got your degree
and you know every-fucking-thing,

1323
01:38:47,438 --> 01:38:51,465
who was gonna love me,
who was gonna make me feel good?

1324
01:38:51,542 --> 01:38:55,205
Who was gonna touch me
and make me feel good late at night?

1325
01:38:55,313 --> 01:38:57,838
And she made him go away, so. . .

1326
01:38:58,616 --> 01:39:02,108
When you sit there and you write
them fucking notes on your pad

1327
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:06,213
about who you think i am,
and why i did it, all of that.

1328
01:39:07,558 --> 01:39:09,788
Because i didn't have nobody.

1329
01:39:18,569 --> 01:39:21,732
The people from

1330
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,399
Each One Teach One,

1331
01:39:26,143 --> 01:39:29,078
they had . . . 
They called me

1332
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:35,143
and they told me that my baby
was writing poems.

1333
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,709
In fact, you know what, 
I got. . .

1334
01:39:36,821 --> 01:39:38,379
Wait a minute.

1335
01:40:04,382 --> 01:40:05,849
I'm sorry.

1336
01:40:06,851 --> 01:40:10,218
I'm sorry.
And, Ms. Weiss, I don't want no checks.

1337
01:40:10,287 --> 01:40:14,519
I don't need no more money. please.
I'm so sorry.

1338
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:17,587
I took that TABE test again.

1339
01:40:18,796 --> 01:40:19,922
And what happened?

1340
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:21,691
I scored a 7.8.

1341
01:40:23,401 --> 01:40:25,301
Last time it was 2.8.

1342
01:40:27,705 --> 01:40:29,070
According to that test,

1343
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:31,870
I'm reading at
a seventh and eighth-grade level.

1344
01:40:33,144 --> 01:40:36,307
Next year, high school. 
Atter that, college.

1345
01:40:42,887 --> 01:40:44,650
Well, i like you, too.

1346
01:40:46,991 --> 01:40:49,050
But you can't handle me.

1347
01:40:50,828 --> 01:40:53,160
You can't handle none of this.

1348
01:41:01,105 --> 01:41:04,506
You know, I never knew what you was
until this day.

1349
01:41:04,608 --> 01:41:07,338
Not even atter all them things you did.

1350
01:41:08,846 --> 01:41:12,338
Maybe i was too stupid, or
maybe i just didn't want to.

1351
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:17,151
You ain't gonna see me no more.

1352
01:41:20,758 --> 01:41:22,020
Bye!

1353
01:41:25,763 --> 01:41:27,628
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1354
01:41:27,698 --> 01:41:30,132
Please, God,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1355
01:41:30,201 --> 01:41:33,102
Ms. Weiss,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1356
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:34,967
I would say to him, 
I would say. . .

1357
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:38,304
''Carl, what are you doing?
What are you doing? What are you doing?''

1358
01:41:47,384 --> 01:41:48,976
Can you go get her back?

1359
01:41:49,053 --> 01:41:51,647
You can do that,
because that's what you do.

1360
01:41:51,722 --> 01:41:53,553
That's what you do.

1361
01:41:53,991 --> 01:41:57,688
I need you to go
and I need you to get my baby back.

1362
01:41:57,795 --> 01:42:01,390
You told me that I could come in here
and you could get. . .

1363
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:03,333
You could get Precious to say. . .

1364
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,891
Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss?

1365
01:42:54,436 --> 01:43:10,304
