1
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,260
You're live in two minutes,
Your Royal Highness.

2
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,600
Sir?

3
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Thank you.

4
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,650
Let the microphone do the work, sir.

5
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.

6
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,170
Time to go.

7
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,510
Good afternoon.

8
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,520
"This is the BBC National Program
and Empire Service...

9
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,810
...taking you to Wembley Stadium
for the closing ceremony...

10
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,810
...Of the Empire Exhibition.

11
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,820
...Where His Royal Highness,
the Duke of York,...

12
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,780
...will read a message from his father;
His Majesty King George V."

13
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,160
"Fifty eight British colonies
and dominions have taken part,...

14
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,330
making this the largest exhibition
staged anywhere in the world."

15
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,170
Remember, sir, three flashes,
then steady red means you're live.

16
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,380
"Using the new invention of radio,...

17
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,670
...the opening ceremony was the first time
His Majesty the King...

18
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,680
...addressed his subjects on the wireless."

19
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,050
"At the close of the first season,

20
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,350
...the heir to the throne,
His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales,...

21
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,270
...made his first broadcast, and today,...

22
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,860
...his younger brother,
His Royal Highness, the Duke of York,...

23
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,070
...will give his inaugural broadcast
to the nation and the world."

24
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,470
I have received...

25
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,110
...from His Majesty the...

26
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,410
...the...

27
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,580
...the King...

28
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,360
Inhale deep into your lungs,
Your Royal Highness.

29
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,370
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?

30
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,460
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves,
and gives you confidence.

31
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,540
Now, if Your Royal Highness
would be so kind as to open your hand.

32
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,260
It's Sterilized. Now..

33
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,310
One, two,

34
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,640
three, four,

35
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,230
five, six...

36
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,150
...seven. Now, if I may take the
liberty, insert them into your mouth?

37
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,820
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?

38
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,200
It's the classic approach.
It cured Demosthenes.

39
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,370
That was in Ancient Greece...uh
Has it worked since?

40
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,420
Now, if you would be
so kind as to read.

41
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,840
"A wealth of words."

42
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,600
Fight against those marbles,
Your Royal Highness.

43
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,230
Enunciate.

44
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,650
A little more concentration,
Your Royal Highness.

45
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,490
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!

46
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,250
Thank you so much, Doctor.
It's been most, um...

47
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,040
- ...interesting.
- Your Royal Highness.

48
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,300
Insert marbles.
He can insert his own bloody marbles.

49
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,680
Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

50
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,850
You know you can't
keep doing this, Bertie.

51
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,020
- I know.
- Mmm.

52
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,110
Promise me...

53
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,780
Promise me no more.

54
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,880
Ah!

55
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,500
Hello?

56
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,880
- Is anyone there?
- I'm just in the loo.

57
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,760
Ah, Mrs. Johnson, there you are.

58
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,230
I'm sorry, I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.

59
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,060
"Poor and content
is rich and rich enough."

60
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,940
- I'm sorry?
- Shakespeare. How are you?

61
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,570
- How do you do?
- Oh, chuffing along.

62
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,410
Um, now, this is slightly awkward,
but I'm afraid you're late.

63
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,910
- Yes. I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?

64
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
Ah... He doesn't know I'm here.

65
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,370
Well, that's not a very promising start.

66
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:55,050
No. No, look,
my husband has seen everyone...

67
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,760
...To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.

68
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,260
- He hasn't seen me.
- You’re awfully sure of yourself.

69
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,890
Well, I'm sure of anyone
who wants to be cured.

70
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,060
Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...

71
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,060
- Well, he's required to speak publicly.
- Perhaps he should change jobs?

72
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,190
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?

73
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,200
Something of that nature, yes.

74
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,410
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by.

75
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,290
Uh... Tuesday would be good.

76
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,200
He can give me his personal details,
I'll make a frank appraisal...

77
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,870
- ...and then we'll take it from there.
- Doctor, forgive me.

78
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,000
Uh, I don't have a "hubby."
We don't "pop."

79
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,460
And nor do we ever talk about
our private lives.

80
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,590
No, you must come to us.

81
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,970
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson,
my game, my turf, my rules.

82
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,180
Mmm.

83
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,970
You'll have to talk this over
with your husband,

84
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,430
and then you can speak to me
on the telephone.

85
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,100
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.

86
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,030
And what if my husband
were the Duke of York?

87
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,450
- The Duke of York?
- Yes... The Duke of York.

88
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,630
I thought the appointment
was for Johnson. Forgive me, Your...

89
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,840
- Royal Highness.
- ...Royal Highness.

90
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,260
Yes, Johnson was used during the Great
War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy

91
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,010
- ...to know he was aboard.
- Am I...considered the enemy?

92
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,850
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.

93
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,430
You'll appreciate the need
for absolute discretion.

94
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,600
Of course.

95
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,610
How did you find me,
Your Royal Highness?

96
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,690
The President of The Society
For Speech Therapists.

97
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,570
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.

98
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean
methods were...

99
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,030
...both "unorthodox" and "controversial."

100
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,830
I warned her those
are not my favourite words.

101
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,540
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work,...

102
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,380
...I need trust and total equality, here
in the safety of my consultation room.

103
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,420
No exceptions.

104
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,970
Oh, well then... In that case...

105
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,060
When can you start?

106
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,280
- She's still sounding a bit rough, mate.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad!

107
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,080
- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.

108
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,370
I had a special visitor this afternoon.

109
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,340
- May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?

110
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,880
No, you must stay, bored stupid, listening
to your parents' inane conversation.

111
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,170
- Thanks, Dad...
- And Mum.

112
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,550
- And Mum.
- Me, too.

113
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,180
- You meeting Jean?
- No. Someone else.

114
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,390
- Doctor? Doctor?
- Hmm?

115
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,230
Go and help your brother
with the washing up.

116
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,020
- I'm fine.
- Who is it, Lionel?

117
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,400
Why bring it up
if you can't talk about it?

118
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,110
Myrtle, it's just a woman
looking to help her husband.

119
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,780
Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.

120
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,830
- One of my favourites.
- Aren't they all?

121
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,370
It Could be a lot of fun.

122
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,460
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

123
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,540
In the amateur scene,
they're a highly regarded group.

124
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,460
From Putney.

125
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,970
No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, "The Flight."

126
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,970
Mama,
I long to know where they fly to.

127
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,470
- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.

128
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,890
Weren't they lucky?

129
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,850
Now Papa, tell a story.

130
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,530
Can't I be a penguin instead?


131
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,950
Well, no, I want a penguin story.

132
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,870
Very quickly.


133
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,000
Once there were...
two princesses.

134
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,170
Princess Elizabeth
and Princess Margaret,

135
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,760
whose papa was a penguin.

136
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,470
This was because he'd been
turned into one by a wicked witch.

137
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,270
This was very inconvenient for him
because he loved...

138
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,190
...to hold his princesses in his arms.

139
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,940
But you can't if you're a penguin
because you...

140
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,860
- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.

141
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,200
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.

142
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,710
And what made matters worse is that
she... she sent him to the South Pole,

143
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,630
which is an awfully long walk back if...

144
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,000
...if you can't fly.

145
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,550
So when he reached the water, he...

146
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,680
...he dived in, through the depths,

147
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,140
so fast that he was in
Southampton Waters by lunchtime.

148
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,060
And from there,
he took the 2:30 to Weybridge,

149
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,730
changed at Clapham Junction, asked a...

150
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,230
...a passing mallard the way
to Buckingham Palace,

151
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,400
swam up The Thames,
out through the plughole

152
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,410
and gave the cook, Mama
and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.

153
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,580
Now, when the girls
heard all the commotion,

154
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,750
they ran to the kitchen,
where they gave him a...

155
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,920
...a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.

156
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,960
And as they kissed him...

157
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,500
...guess what he turned into?

158
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,340
- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.

159
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,140
- Oh.
- With wings so big,

160
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,430
that he could wrap them both around
his two girls together.

161
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,770
Now, girls. Time for bed. Come on.

162
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,810
- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.

163
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,980
- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.

164
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,110
Feed them, brush them and to bed.

165
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,370
- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.

166
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,290
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?

167
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,790
No. About her.

168
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,340
- A married woman? He can't be.
- She can.

169
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,760
By the way, I think I've found
someone rather interesting.

170
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,380
On Harley Street. A doctor.

171
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,680
Out of the question.

172
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,310
I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat... Matter's settled.

173
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,140
Mmm. His approach
seems rather different.

174
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Now?

175
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,400
Now.

176
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,280
Now is the winter of our discontent,

177
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,160
made glorious summer
by this sun of York.

178
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,960
And all the clouds
that lour'd upon our house

179
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,670
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

180
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,970
Now are our brows bound
with... victorious... wreaths;

181
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,760
Thank you.

182
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,520
- Lovely diction, Mr...?
- Logue. Lionel Logue.

183
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,230
Well, Mr. Logue,

184
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,190
I'm not hearing the cries
of a deformed creature

185
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,900
yearning to be king.

186
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,530
Nor did I realize Richard III
was King of the Colonies.

187
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,240
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.

188
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,040
- Sydney?
- Perth.

189
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,290
Major theatre town, is it?

190
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,330
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.

191
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,170
I was well reviewed.

192
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,220
Yes.

193
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,310
Well, Lionel,
I think our dramatic society

194
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,520
is looking for someone slightly younger.

195
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,060
And a... little more regal.

196
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,320
- There you are.
- Thank you.

197
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,240
- Oh.
- Mmm.

198
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,660
No, you have to shut that one first.

199
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,790
Close that one first. That's it.

200
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,830
Where did you find this... physician?

201
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,670
Classifieds. Next to a
"French model, Shepherd's Market."

202
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,260
No, he comes highly recommended.

203
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,550
Charges substantial fees
to help the poor.

204
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,550
Oh, dear. Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.

205
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,600
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.

206
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,190
Uh... The Johnsons.

207
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,620
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.

208
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,420
Lionel says wait here
if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.

209
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,590
Or, it being a...

210
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,800
... pleasant day...

211
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,270
P...perhaps take a stroll.

212
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,730
Was that all right, Lionel?

213
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,730
Marvelous, Willie.

214
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,110
You can stay here and wait for your mum.

215
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,360
Mrs. Johnson.

216
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,320
Mr. Johnson. Do come in.

217
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,680
Would you like a sweetie?

218
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,180
He's a good lad, Willie.

219
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,560
He could hardly make a sound, you know,
when he first came to me.

220
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,860
My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?

221
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,280
Please, make yourself comfortable.

222
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,260
I was told not to sit too close.

223
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,520
Well I believe when speaking with a prince,

224
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,520
One waits for the prince
to choose the topic.

225
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,570
Waiting for me to...

226
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,830
...commence a conversation,
one can wait rather a long wait.

227
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,830
Ah, yes, well...

228
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,250
Do you know any jokes?

229
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:13,770
- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- Cup of tea?

230
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:18,060
- No. No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.

231
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,700
Aren't you going to start treating me,
Dr. Logue?

232
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,830
Only if you're interested
in being treated.

233
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,580
Please, call me Lionel.

234
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,920
No, I... prefer Doctor.

235
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,550
I prefer Lionel.

236
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,140
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.

237
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,890
Then... it's "sir" after that.

238
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,810
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.

239
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,940
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur...

240
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,110
...George?

241
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,110
How about Bertie?

242
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,490
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.

243
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,080
In here, it's better if we're equals.

244
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,800
If... if we were equals,
I wouldn't be here.

245
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,760
I'd be... at home with my wife,

246
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,970
and no one would give a damn.

247
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,180
Please, don't do that.

248
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,680
I'm sorry?

249
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,850
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs,
well, it will kill you.

250
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,440
My physicians say it relaxes the...

251
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,400
- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.

252
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,490
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.

253
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,740
My castle, my rules.

254
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,250
Thank you.

255
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,380
What was your earliest memory?

256
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,710
- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.

257
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,300
I'm not...

258
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,010
...here to discuss personal matters.

259
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,640
- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!

260
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,730
- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.

261
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,690
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.

262
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,940
- I doubt that.
- Don't...

263
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,070
- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.

264
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,160
I can assure you, no infant
starts to speak with a stammer.

265
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
When did yours start?

266
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,370
- Four or five.
- That's typical.

267
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,380
So I've been told.

268
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,050
I... I can't remember not doing it.

269
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,760
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?

270
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,180
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?

271
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,350
Everyone natters to themselves
occasionally, Bertie.

272
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,270
Stop... Stop calling me that.

273
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,730
I'm not going to call you anything else.

274
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,690
Then we shan't speak.


275
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,910
Are you charging for this, Doctor?

276
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,130
A fortune.

277
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,340
I'll just let that brew.

278
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,720
So... when you talk to yourself,
do you stammer?

279
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,480
No... of course not.

280
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,980
Well, that proves that your impediment
isn't a permanent part of you.

281
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,320
What do you think was the cause?

282
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
I don't... don't know.

283
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,950
I... I don't... I don't care.

284
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,700
I... I stammer.

285
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,000
No one can fix it.

286
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,710
I'll bet you that you can read
flawlessly, right here, right now.

287
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,920
And if I win the bet,
I get to ask you more questions.

288
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,920
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.

289
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,640
One usually... wagers money.

290
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,100
A bob each to keep it sweet?

291
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:27,270
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.

292
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,810
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.

293
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,360
I'll stake you, and you can
pay me back next time.

294
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,450
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.

295
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,990
So please stand, uh,
and take a look at that.

296
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,290
From there.

297
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,050
I... I can't read this.

298
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,630
Well, then you owe me
a shilling for not trying.

299
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,980
To be...

300
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,320
...or not to be, that...

301
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:23,330
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh! I haven't finished yet.

302
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,840
I'm going to record your voice and then
play it back to you on the same machine.

303
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,180
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America.

304
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,720
It's a Silvertone.

305
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,230
Pop these on.

306
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,320
There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.

307
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,580
- You're playing music!
- I know.

308
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,290
So how can I hear what I'm saying?

309
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,960
Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth's doing?

310
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,470
You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?

311
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,880
Hopeless.

312
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,130
Hopeless!

313
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,010
You were sublime.

314
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,180
Would I lie to a prince of the realm
to win 12 pennies?

315
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,720
I've no idea...

316
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,850
...what an Australian
might do for that sort of money.

317
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,940
Let me play it back to you.

318
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,270
No.

319
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,530
All right, then, well,
I get to ask you the questions.

320
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,070
Thank you, Doctor. I don't...

321
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
...feel this is for me.

322
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,200
Thank you for your time.

323
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,170
Goodbye.

324
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,840
Sir?

325
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,760
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.

326
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,940
No.

327
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,080
Oh, well.

328
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,370
Bugger.

329
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,840
For the present, the work
to which we are all equally bound,

330
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,180
is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity
within our borders,

331
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,510
...to regain prosperity
at this time of depression

332
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,770
without self-seeking,
and to carry with us

333
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,980
those whom the burden of the past years

334
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,190
has disheartened or overborne.

335
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,740
To all, to each,
I wish a happy Christmas.

336
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,870
God bless you.

337
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,370
And off air.

338
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,120
Easy when you know how.

339
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,170
Sir?

340
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,760
Have a go yourself.

341
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,050
- Congratulations, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wood.

342
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,640
Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.

343
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,980
- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.

344
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,480
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.

345
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,570
Sit up. Straight back.

346
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,780
Face boldly up to the bloody thing
and stare it square in the eye,

347
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,990
as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.

348
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,660
Papa, I d...don't... thu...thu...
think I c... c... can read this.

349
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,160
This devilish device will change
everything if you don't.

350
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,670
In the past, all a king had to do
was look respectable in uniform

351
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,630
and not fall off his horse.

352
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,340
Now, we must invade people's homes
and ingratiate ourselves with them.

353
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:51,010
This family's been reduced to those
lowest, basest of all creatures.

354
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,850
We've become actors.

355
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,970
We're not a family, we're a firm.

356
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,020
Yet at any moment,
some of us may be out of work.

357
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,020
Your darling brother and future king,

358
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,820
the only wife he appears interested in
is invariably the wife of another.

359
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,860
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.

360
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,370
A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.

361
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,990
No divorced person
can ever be received at court.

362
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,040
He said it made him sublimely happy.


363
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,840
I imagine that was
because she was sleeping with him.

364
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,710
"I give you my word,"
this is what he said.

365
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,340
"I give you my word,
we've never had immoral relations."

366
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,510
Stared square into
his father's face and lied.

367
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,850
When I'm dead,
that boy will ruin himself,

368
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,230
this family and this nation
within 12 months.

369
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:45,730
Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.

370
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,070
Marshal Stalin the other half.

371
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,440
Who will stand between us,

372
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,570
the jackboots
and the proletarian abyss?

373
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,120
You?

374
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,580
Well?

375
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,250
With your older brother
shirking his duties,

376
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,840
you're going to have to do
a lot more of this.

377
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,710
Have a go yourself.

378
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,430
Through the...


379
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,390
...wireless...
- Get it out, boy.

380
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,850
...one of the...

381
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,690
... m... marvels of m...

382
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,400
"Modern." Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.

383
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,240
...science...

384
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,910
...I am enabled, this ...

385
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,700
Relax.

386
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,250
Just try it!

387
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,210
...this Christmas Day...

388
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,840
...to speak to all my...

389
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,170
Do it!

390
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,560
Lying... bastard.

391
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,210
- You're playing music.
- I know.

392
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,210
So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?

393
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,550
Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth's doing.

394
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,600
You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?

395
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,820
"To be or not be,
that is the question.

396
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,860
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

397
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,370
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

398
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,330
or to take arms
against a sea of troubles,

399
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,710
and by opposing end them?

400
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,920
To die, to sleep no more,

401
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,880
and by a sleep to say the end

402
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,050
is the heartache
and the thousand natural shocks

403
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:22,760
the flesh is heir to:
'tis a consummation hopeless."

404
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,720
Hopeless!

405
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,230
Strictly business. No...

406
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,270
- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear...

407
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,070
- ...in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?

408
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,650
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.

409
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,410
Besides, you... you tricked me.

410
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,080
Physical exercises
and tricks are important,

411
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,410
but what you're asking will only deal
with the surface of the problem.

412
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,580
Is that sufficient? Uh, no.

413
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:56,510
As far as I see it, my husband has
mechanical difficulties with his speech.

414
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,420
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.

415
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,640
I...

416
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,180
- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.

417
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:11,940
Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?

418
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,280
All right. You want mechanics?

419
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,530
We need to relax your jaw muscles,
strengthen your tongue,

420
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,320
by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.

421
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,290
I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

422
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,790
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.

423
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,960
And you do have a flabby tummy,
so we'll need to spend some time

424
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,750
strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.

425
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,050
- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.

426
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,470
Forget about the blessed shilling!

427
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,900
Perhaps, upon occasions...

428
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,400
...you might be requested to assist...

429
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,160
...in coping with...

430
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,790
...with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?

431
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,830
Of course.

432
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,580
Yes, and that would be the full extent
of your services.

433
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,670
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.

434
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,220
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.

435
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,600
Feel the looseness of the jaw.

436
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,730
Good. Little bounces. Bounces.

437
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,690
Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.

438
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,940
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.

439
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,360
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.

440
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,450
Put your hands onto your ribs.

441
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,660
Deeper. Good.

442
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,790
- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.

443
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,250
Isn't that what
public speaking's all about?

444
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:00,840
My wife and I are glad
to visit this important...

445
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,800
Take a good deep breath,
and up comes Your Royal Highness.

446
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,220
And slowly exhale,
and down comes Your Royal Highness.

447
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,510
- You all right, Bertie?
- Yes.

448
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,140
It's actually quite good fun.

449
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,940
Mmm... Mother.

450
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,650
Shorten the humming each time.

451
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,900
Mother. Mmm...

452
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,400
...manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.

453
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,070
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.

454
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,990
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.

455
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,740
Now, just sway.

456
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,240
Perfect.

457
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:35,120
...will not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.

458
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,580
Ding dong bell,
pussy's in the well.

459
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,340
Who put her in? Little Tommy Tin.

460
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,220
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.

461
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,270
- A cow, a cow...
- A king.

462
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,430
A... a king...

463
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,980
Anyone who can shout vowels at an open
window can learn to deliver a speech.

464
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,200
- Fourteen, 15!
- Good. Deep breath, and...

465
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,450
It is...

466
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,290
- Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.

467
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,290
Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.

468
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,620
A sieve of thisted siphles.

469
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,540
Gah! Mah! Bah!

470
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,600
Father.

471
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,930
- Father.
- Father.

472
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,730
- Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.

473
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,190
- Father.
- Father.

474
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,400
Father. Father.

475
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,180
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.

476
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,020
- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.

477
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,480
You been waiting long?

478
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,530
Christ, bloody freezing.

479
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,700
Where have you been?

480
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,620
- I've been busy.
- So have I.

481
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,250
- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

482
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,540
- She'll recover.
- Father won't.

483
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,420
I'll drive.

484
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,010
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.

485
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:56,180
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.

486
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,100
To... To complicate matters with Wallis.

487
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,980
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.

488
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,320
Wallis explained. She's terribly clever
about these things.

489
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,820
Whereas my letters patent
under the Great Seal

490
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,660
bearing date of Westminster
the 11th day of June 1912,

491
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,410
His Majesty King George the Fifth
did constitute order

492
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,210
and declare that there
should be a Guardian...

493
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,830
- What's going on here?
- ...custos regne...

494
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,750
I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand...

495
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,760
It's the Order
of the Council of State, sir.

496
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,050
So that we may act on your behalf...

497
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,100
...much clearer to me, I'm afraid...

498
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,730
- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.

499
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,440
Thank you.

500
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,830
- Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...

501
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,040
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

502
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,670
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.

503
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,050
I feel dreadful. Ah...

504
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,720
Been, uh, ice skating? Ice skating?

505
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,560
No. No, George.

506
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,280
Yes. Yes, all right, of course.

507
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,200
I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talk

508
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:47,250
is a poor substitute
for holding tight and making drowsy.

509
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,250
Nor making our own drowsies either,
as we've had to do too often lately.

510
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,170
- David. Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.

511
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,970
It's Bertie.

512
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,430
No. No, it's not important.

513
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,060
I don't want to.

514
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,390
No. Telephone me later?

515
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,690
All right, goodbye.


516
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,490
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.

517
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:25,950
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks
are all half an hour fast.

518
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,560
How's the King?
I... I hope he's not in pain.

519
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,430
No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.

520
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,150
Thank you.

521
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,610
David, if your father were here,
tardiness would not be tolerated.

522
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,660
None of this unpleasantness
would be tolerated.

523
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,330
You know, sir, I appreciate
that you are different from your father,

524
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,380
both in outlook and... temperament.

525
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,970
I want you to know that whenever
the King questioned your conduct,

526
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,850
I tried, in your interest,

527
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:27,060
to present it
in the most favourable light.

528
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,640
Mmm. I can always trust you
to have my best interests at heart.

529
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:50,710
I fear our vigil will not be
of long duration. Please continue.

530
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:08,260
Let us commend our brother George
to the mercy of God,

531
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,930
Our Maker and Redeemer.

532
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,280
Long live the King.

533
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,550
I hope I will make good
as he has made good.

534
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,090
- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.

535
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,170
Now, I'm trapped.

536
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:41,070
And in these last 25
crowded, troubled, glorious years,

537
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,940
if there is one thing
that King George has taught,

538
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,910
it is the art of the leader who
is also a brother to his followers.

539
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:54,580
As long as he lived, he was
the guiding star of a great nation.

540
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,250
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?

541
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,670
- When he died...
- Time for a Shake, Dad?

542
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,790
... the little children
cried in the streets.

543
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,380
- You sure?
- Go on.

544
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,310
Put your thinking caps on.

545
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:21,020
- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello. It's always Othello.

546
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,790
Art thou afeard?

547
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,250
- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.

548
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:40,420
Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.

549
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,040
Don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.

550
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,760
The isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs

551
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,090
that give delight, and hurt not.

552
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,180
Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears,

553
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,350
and sometimes voices, that,
if then I had waked after long sleep,

554
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:01,150
will make me sleep again. All right,
clever clogs, so what comes next?

555
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:04,190
And then, in dreaming,
methought the clouds would...

556
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:06,940
- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open,

557
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,200
and show riches ready to drop upon me,

558
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,570
that when I waked,
I cried to dream again.

559
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,160
That's such a sad thought.


560
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,580
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.

561
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,540
Won't be a moment, Clifford.

562
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,460
Bertie?

563
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,340
They told me not to expect you.

564
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,600
I'm sorry about your father.

565
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,440
- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all. Please, come in. Come in.

566
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:55,410
I've been practicing. An hour a day.

567
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,580
In spite of everything.

568
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:59,540
What's going on there?

569
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,710
Oh, I was... Sorry.

570
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:06,000
Mucking around with my kids.

571
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,590
Do you feel like working today?

572
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:19,390
- A Curtis bi-plane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.

573
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:21,230
Logue. Logue.

574
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,020
I'd kill for something stronger.

575
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,400
I wasn't there
for my father's death.

576
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:35,660
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine so.

577
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,750
- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.

578
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,790
At least there was free beer.

579
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,540
Here's to the memory of your father.

580
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,930
I was informed, after the fact,

581
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:57,600
that my father's...

582
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,720
My father's last words were...

583
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,980
..."Bertie has more guts than the
rest of his brothers put together."

584
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,030
He couldn’t say that to my face.

585
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,160
My brother.

586
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,950
What about him?

587
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,170
Try singing it.

588
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,710
- I'm sorry.
- What songs do you know?

589
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,630
- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.

590
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,590
- "Swanee River."
- I love that song.

591
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,220
- It happens to be my favourite.
- Sing me the chorus.

592
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,390
No. Certainly not.

593
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,440
You know...
I always wanted to build models.

594
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,270
But... Father wouldn't allow it.

595
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:57,030
He... collected stamps,
so we had to collect stamps.

596
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,080
You can finish that off if you sing.

597
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,120
"My brother David
Dum, dum, dum, dum..."

598
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,170
- I'm not going to sit here warbling.
- You can with me.

599
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,670
- Because you're peculiar.
- I take that as a compliment.

600
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,380
Well...

601
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,890
Rules are rules.

602
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:28,640
I'm not... crooning "Swanee River".

603
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,190
"Camptown Races", then.
"My brother David said to me...

604
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,320
...Doo-dah, doo-dah"

605
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,450
- Continuous sound will give you flow.
- No.

606
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:51,540
Does it feel strange
now that David's on the throne?

607
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:55,210
To tell the truth, it was a relief.

608
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,920
Knowing I...

609
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,550
...wouldn't be... King.

610
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,890
But unless he produces an heir,
you're next in line.

611
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:11,270
And your daughter, Elizabeth,
would then succeed you.

612
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:15,730
"You're barking up
the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor"

613
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,980
"Lionel"

614
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:19,200
See? You didn't stammer.

615
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,490
Of course I didn't stammer,
I was singing.

616
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:29,160
Well, as a little reward, you get
to put some glue on these struts.

617
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,340
- Your boy... won't mind?
- No, not at all.

618
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:45,720
David and I were... very close.

619
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,930
Young bucks, you know.

620
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,230
Did you chase the same girls?

621
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:01,450
David was always very helpful
in... arranging introductions.

622
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,780
We shared the...

623
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:08,580
...expert ministrations

624
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,870
Of Paulette in the Palace.

625
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,130
Not at the same time, of course.

626
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,300
- Did David ever tease you?
- Oh, yes, they all did.

627
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,010
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie."

628
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,480
Father encouraged it.

629
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,810
Said, "Get it out, boy!"
Said it would make me stop.

630
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,980
He said, "I was afraid of my father

631
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:43,990
and my children are...
damn well gonna be afraid of me!"

632
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,780
Are you naturally right-handed?

633
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,830
Left.

634
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,460
I was... punished,
and now I use the right.

635
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,750
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.

636
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:08,300
- Any other corrections?
- Knock knees.

637
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:12,680
Metal splints were made.

638
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,770
Worn... worn day and night.

639
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,520
- Must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.

640
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,940
Straight legs now.

641
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,070
Who were you closest to in your family?

642
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:29,370
Nannies.

643
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,700
Not my first nanny. She...

644
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,620
She loved David. Hated me.

645
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,170
When we were...

646
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,710
...presented to my parents
for the daily viewing,

647
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,760
she would... she'd pinch me

648
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,430
so that I'd cry and be handed back
to her immediately.

649
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,140
And then she would...

650
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,810
Sing it.

651
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,990
# Then she wouldn't feed me #

652
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:09,200
# Far, far away #

653
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:16,370
Took my parents...
three years to notice.

654
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:22,170
As you... as you can imagine,
caused some stomach problems.

655
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:24,760
Still.

656
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,720
What about your brother, Johnnie?

657
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,430
Were you close to him?

658
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,850
Johnnie... sweet boy.

659
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,940
Had...

660
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,200
...epilepsy.

661
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,040
And he was... different.

662
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,330
He died at... 13.

663
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,420
Hidden from view.

664
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,260
I'm... I'm told it's not... catching.

665
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,060
Do you want a top-up?

666
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,940
Please.

667
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,280
You know...

668
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,110
...Lionel, you're...

669
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,070
...you're the first
ordinary Englishman...

670
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,740
- Australian.
- ...I've ever really spoken to.

671
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:40,830
When I'm... driven through the streets

672
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,790
and I see the, you know,
the common man staring at me, I...

673
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,590
...I'm struck by how little
I know of his life

674
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:52,630
and how little he knows of mine.

675
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,140
- Thank you.
- What are friends for?

676
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,190
I wouldn't know.

677
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,190
I sifted seven...

678
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,570
...thick-stalked thistles
through a strong, thick sieve.

679
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,240
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enough now, darling.

680
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:21,000
Listen, I have to keep doing this,
it's awful. I sifted seven...

681
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,420
- Oh, no.
- ...thick-stalked...

682
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:30,670
One-hundred-year-old spruces
removed to improve the view?

683
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,720
Who does she think she is?

684
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,220
Nonetheless, we must try
to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.

685
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,640
- She calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook."
- You're not fat.

686
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,140
I'm getting plump.

687
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,770
Well, you seldom cook.

688
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,190
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.

689
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,740
...thick sieves...
I sifted seven...

690
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,660
Three, two, one and...

691
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,250
Their Royal Highnesses
the Duke and Duchess of York.

692
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:06,290
Oh, how lovely to see you both.

693
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,170
Welcome to our little country shack.

694
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,510
I came at the invitation of the King.

695
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,850
Your Majesty.

696
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,600
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.

697
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,770
Very nice to see you... Mrs. Simpson.

698
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,940
Very nice.

699
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:42,580
Hello, David. Making some...

700
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,120
...changes to the garden, I see.

701
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:47,960
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.

702
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,420
Don't tell me I behaved badly,
Mr. Churchill.

703
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,880
On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.

704
00:57:56,970 --> 00:58:00,220
Etiquette decrees that royalty
should be greeted by the official host,

705
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,100
in this case, the King. Not a commoner.

706
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,390
Thank you.

707
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:11,400
- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.

708
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,150
Apparently, she has certain skills

709
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,780
acquired in an establishment
in Shanghai.

710
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,370
David.

711
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,420
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?

712
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:44,430
- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.

713
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,020
- Doing what?
- Kinging.

714
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,770
Really? Kinging is a...

715
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,730
...a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?

716
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,530
- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- You're being dreary.

717
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:03,780
Is kinging laying off 80... staff
and buying more pearls for Wallis,

718
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,620
while people are marching across Europe
singing The Red Flag?

719
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,540
- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?

720
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:12,290
Where's the bloody 23?

721
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,210
And you put that woman
in our mother's suite!

722
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,420
- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.

723
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,880
Here it is. Wallis likes the very best.

724
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,510
I don't care what woman
you carry on with at night,

725
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,390
as long as you... show up
for duty in the morning.

726
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:29,600
Wallis is not just some woman
I'm carrying on with.

727
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,440
We intend to marry.

728
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:37,230
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.

729
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,940
Good God.

730
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:43,320
Can't you just give her
a nice house and a title?

731
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:46,290
- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,

732
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:50,500
- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?

733
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,790
- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.

734
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,420
Your beloved common man
may marry for love. Why not me?

735
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,210
If you were... a common man,

736
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,430
On what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?

737
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,140
Sounds like you've
studied our wretched Constitution.

738
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,810
- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.

739
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:10,520
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.

740
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,480
- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...

741
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,940
Yearning for a larger audience,
are we, B-B-Bertie?

742
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,990
Don't...

743
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,040
What's that?

744
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,950
I'm sorry, I...

745
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,500
Younger brother trying to push
older brother off the throne.

746
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,880
P-P-Positively mediaeval.

747
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,960
Wallis.

748
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:43,470
Ah. Where have you been all this time?

749
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:46,300
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.

750
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:53,350
What a very complicated
little King you are.

751
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,650
I try to be.


752
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,900
All that work... down the drain.

753
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,690
My own brother.

754
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:06,110
I couldn't say a single word
to him in reply.

755
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,330
Why do you stammer so much more
with David than you ever do with me?

756
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:11,620
Because you're bloody well
paid to listen.

757
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,670
- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.

758
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:19,090
What is it about David
that stops you speaking?

759
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:22,090
What is it about you that bloody
well makes you want to go on about him

760
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,010
- the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.

761
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:27,840
- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!

762
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,810
- Is that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody...

763
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,350
...bugger to you, you beastly bastard.

764
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,810
Oh, a public school prig
could do better than that.

765
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,520
Shit.

766
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,400
Shit, shit, shit.

767
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,700
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

768
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,660
Yes, defecation flows
trippingly from the tongue.

769
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,790
- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the "f" word?

770
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:57,500
- Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.

771
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,170
Fuck. Fuck!

772
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,380
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!

773
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,510
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!

774
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:06,880
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!

775
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,640
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see? Not a hesitation.

776
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,390
Willy, shit and fuck! And tits.

777
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:16,180
- Dad, what's going on?
- Sorry.

778
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,770
Just finish your homework.

779
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,570
Well, that's a side of you
we don't get to see all that often.

780
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,440
No.

781
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:26,780
No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.

782
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:31,950
- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.

783
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,750
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?

784
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:41,590
Logue, you have no idea.

785
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,760
My... my brother

786
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,180
is infatuated with a...

787
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,760
...woman who's been married twice.

788
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,930
She's asking for a divorce,
and he's determined to marry her.

789
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:58,560
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson...

790
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,610
- ...of Baltimore.
- That's not right.

791
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,940
- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.

792
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:08,780
- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.

793
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:12,990
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.

794
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,700
- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.

795
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,830
Where does this leave you?

796
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:25,420
I know my place. I...

797
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,800
I... I will do anything...

798
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,800
...in my power to keep
my brother on the throne.

799
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,850
Is it that serious?

800
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,230
- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.

801
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:43,060
- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!

802
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,650
- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.

803
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,610
- You could do it.
- That is treason.

804
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:50,650
I'm trying to get you to realize
you needn't be governed by fear.

805
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,490
I've had enough of this.

806
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,030
- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!

807
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,830
Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class banker

808
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,830
who wants elocution lessons
so you can chitchat...

809
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,210
Don't attempt to instruct me
on my duties!

810
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:08,460
I am the son of a... King.

811
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,300
And the brother of... of a King.

812
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,640
You're the disappointing son
of a brewer.

813
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,010
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.

814
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,230
You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.

815
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,890
Through here, sir.

816
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:09,190
It's not because she's an
American. That is the least of it.

817
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,240
It's because she's a soon
to be twice divorced American.

818
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:18,490
And the King,
as head of the Church of England,

819
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:22,000
cannot marry a divorced woman.

820
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:26,000
And, sir, I apologize
for the nature of this.

821
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,670
According to Scotland Yard,

822
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,840
the King has not always
possessed exclusive rights

823
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:41,010
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections...

824
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:45,270
...sharing them with a
married used car salesman,

825
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:48,270
a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.

826
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:54,360
In addition, it is also
rumoured Hitler's ambassador,

827
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:59,120
Count von Ribbentrop,
sends her 17 carnations every day.

828
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:04,450
Should His Majesty continue to ignore
the advice of his government,

829
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,290
he must abdicate.

830
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:09,830
Otherwise, his government
has no choice but to resign.

831
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,000
Prime Minister,
you'd leave a country without a...

832
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,380
...a government?

833
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,550
Does the King do what he wants?

834
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,720
Or does he do what
the people expect him to do?

835
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:27,390
As crowds in Downing
Street watch ministers come and go,

836
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,900
there is raised an age-old problem:
Can a king separate his personal life

837
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,440
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, love?

838
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,320
I'm just having trouble with a patient.

839
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,320
That isn't like you.

840
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:45,290
- Why?
- He's scared.

841
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,120
He's afraid of his own shadow.

842
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,080
Isn't that why they come to you?

843
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,170
This fellow could
really be somebody great.

844
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,630
He's fighting me.

845
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,260
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.

846
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,350
Perhaps that's what you want.

847
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,810
I might have overstepped the mark.

848
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,780
Apologize. Do you both good.

849
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:32,330
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue,
the Duke is busy.

850
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:36,670
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.

851
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:40,260
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.

852
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:56,820
Thank you.

853
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:06,660
Parliament will not support
the marriage.

854
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,080
But there are other reasons for concern.

855
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:15,500
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve,

856
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:18,210
and there are those who are
worried about where he will stand

857
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,670
when war comes with Germany.

858
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:26,760
- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.

859
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:32,020
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,
but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.

860
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,770
War with Germany will come.

861
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:39,190
And we will need a King
whom we can all stand behind, united.

862
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,990
I fear my...

863
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,450
...brother is not of sound mind...

864
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,410
...at this time.

865
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:52,370
Have you thought
what you will call yourself? Hmm?

866
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:04,050
Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic. 

867
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:13,890
What about George?
After your father?

868
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:19,820
George the Sixth
has a rather nice continuity to it.

869
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:20,980
Don't you think?

870
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,820
David. Thank God.

871
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:30,290
You look exhausted.

872
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,580
How are you bearing up?

873
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,170
Bertie, the decision's been made. I...

874
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,920
I'm going.

875
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:44,760
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.

876
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,470
I must marry her.

877
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:54,100
My mind's made up. I'm... sorry.

878
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,440
That's a terrible thing to hear.

879
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,280
Nobody wants that.

880
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,780
I, least of all.

881
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,870
At long last,

882
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,670
I am able to say a few words of my own.

883
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,670
I have never wanted
to withhold anything,

884
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,010
but until now it has not been
constitutionally possible

885
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:28,380
for me to speak.

886
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:33,680
A few hours ago,
I discharged my last duty

887
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,560
as King and Emperor,

888
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:42,070
and now that I have been succeeded
by my brother,

889
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,980
the Duke of York,

890
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:47,900
my first words must be
to declare my allegiance to him.

891
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:51,740
This I do with all my heart.

892
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:59,330
You all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne,

893
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:03,340
but you must believe me when I tell you

894
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,590
that I have found it impossible
to carry the heavy burden

895
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:10,800
Of responsibility
and to discharge my duties as King,

896
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:13,260
as I would wish to do

897
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:18,180
without the help and support
of the woman I love.

898
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,100
And I want you to know,

899
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:26,110
this decision has been
made less difficult to me

900
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:29,030
by the sure knowledge that my brother,

901
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:32,280
with his long training
in the public affairs of this country,

902
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:36,450
and with his fine qualities,

903
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,210
will be able to take my place forthwith

904
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:43,880
without interruption or injury

905
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,880
to the life and progress of the Empire.

906
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,130
I meet you today...

907
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,800
...in...

908
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,890
...in circumstances which are...

909
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:34,900
- I'm sure you'll love it.
- There you go.

910
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,990
Thank you, darling.
Saddles. Margaret.

911
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:40,410
- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.

912
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:44,330
- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you. Oops.

913
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,540
- Don't worry, Sally. We'll get you...
- Mama?

914
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,380
- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses...

915
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:50,920
- ...in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.

916
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,460
We'll have a palace of rooms.

917
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:04,230
Curtsey.

918
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,690
Your Majesty.

919
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,160
How was it?

920
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:42,350
I was trying to...
familiarize myself

921
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:46,060
with... what a state paper looks like.

922
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,520
It's a...

923
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:55,070
...dispatch from Mr. Baldwin,
which I don't understand a word of.

924
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,160
David's finances.

925
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:08,710
Christmas... broadcast.

926
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,090
- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.

927
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,050
Oh.

928
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,140
Plans for the Coronation.

929
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,100
Think that would be
an even bigger mistake.

930
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,980
- I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.

931
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,320
I'm a Naval officer. That's all I know.

932
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:47,580
I'm not a King. I'm not a King.

933
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:50,870
- I'm sorry.
- No.

934
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,790
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly. Please.

935
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,630
Oh, my dear.

936
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,260
My dear, dear man.

937
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:05,850
- I'm sorry.
- You know,

938
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:09,730
I refused your first
two marriage proposals,

939
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:12,400
not because I didn't love you,

940
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,570
but because I couldn't bear
the idea of a Royal life.

941
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:20,360
Couldn't bear the idea of a life
of tours, public duty, of...

942
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:24,660
Well, a life that no longer
was really to be my own.

943
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:31,080
But then I thought, he stammers
so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.

944
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,450
Waiting for a King to apologize,
one can wait rather a long wait.

945
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:09,410
I'm afraid we're slightly late.

946
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,120
This is home.

947
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:17,130
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.

948
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:20,630
It's lovely. Absolutely lovely.

949
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:24,260
- Oh! May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.

950
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,600
- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.

951
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,900
Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?

952
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,280
Here's your shilling.

953
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,620
I...

954
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,160
I understand...

955
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,420
...what you were trying to say, Logue.

956
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,420
I went about it the wrong way.

957
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,800
I'm sorry.

958
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,340
So, here I am.

959
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:12,140
Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?

960
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,810
Every stammerer always fears
going back to square one.

961
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:17,690
I don't let that happen.

962
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:21,150
If I fail in my duty,

963
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:25,820
David could come back.
I've seen the placards.

964
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:30,200
"God save our... King."

965
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,080
They don't mean me.

966
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:36,870
Every monarch in history

967
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,630
has succeeded someone who's dead

968
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:43,420
Or just about to be.

969
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:51,140
My predecessor is not only alive,
but very much so.

970
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,890
It's a bloody mess.

971
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,480
Couldn't even give them
a Christmas speech.

972
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,570
- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.

973
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:06,280
He's not here anymore.

974
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:11,410
Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.

975
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:15,620
Easy enough to give away.

976
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,750
You don't have to carry him
around in your pocket.

977
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:20,330
Or your brother.

978
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:24,170
You don't need to be afraid
of the things you were afraid of

979
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:26,760
when you were five.

980
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,760
You're very much your own man, Bertie.

981
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:37,850
Am I?

982
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:44,860
- Your face is next, mate.
- Lionel, dear!

983
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:46,940
Myrtle.

984
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:50,570
- Is this your wife?
- Yes.

985
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:53,200
Bertie. Come here.

986
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:57,200
- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.

987
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:02,460
- Shouldn't we go through?
- Trust me, it's important.

988
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,630
- What is it?
- Oh!

989
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:10,220
- You're...
- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.

990
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,640
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."

991
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,390
Not "malm" as in "palm."

992
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,970
I haven't told her about us.

993
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,850
Sit down, relax.

994
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:24,440
I'm told your husband
calls my husband Bertie.

995
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,860
And my husband calls
your husband Lionel.

996
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:28,440
I trust you won't call me Liz.

997
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:33,450
Your Majesty, you may
call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.

998
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:35,410
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.

999
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:40,040
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.

1000
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,290
- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.

1001
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:45,210
- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.

1002
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,130
Get out there, man.

1003
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,880
Hello, Myrtle, darling.

1004
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,010
You're early.

1005
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,140
I believe you two have met,
but I don't think you know...

1006
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,980
...king George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.

1007
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,070
Will Their Majesties
be staying to dinner?

1008
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:16,200
We'd love to, such a treat,
but alas a...

1009
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,030
...previous engagement. What a pity.

1010
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:37,760
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.

1011
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,680
What a glorious transformation, sir.

1012
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:45,140
I hope you'll forgive us
if we continue our preparations?

1013
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:51,940
Now, allow me to guide you
through the ceremony.

1014
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:01,240
We begin, of course,
at the West door into the nave.

1015
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:06,750
I see all your pronouncements
are to be broadcast, Archbishop.

1016
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:09,290
Ah, yes. Wireless.

1017
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,750
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box,

1018
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,050
and I'm afraid I've also had
to permit the newsreel cameras.

1019
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:19,760
The product of which
I shall personally edit.

1020
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:22,350
Without momentary hesitations.

1021
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:26,140
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.

1022
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:30,020
He's... my speech therapist.

1023
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:33,860
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty

1024
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:36,950
was seeking assistance, I should
have made my own recommendation.

1025
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:39,450
Dr. Logue will...

1026
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,410
...will be attending the Coronation.

1027
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:47,290
Of course I'll speak to the Dean,
but it will be extremely difficult.

1028
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,210
I should like the...

1029
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:54,340
...doctor to be seated in the...

1030
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:55,630
...King's Box.

1031
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:59,720
But members of your family
will be seated there, sir.

1032
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,600
That is why it is suitable.

1033
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:05,850
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace,
we need the premises.

1034
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:08,480
My dear fellow,
this is Westminster Abbey.

1035
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,600
The Church must prepare His Majesty.

1036
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:13,610
My preparations are equally
as important.

1037
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,570
With complete privacy,
if you don't mind.

1038
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,580
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1039
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:29,790
I will place the Abbey
at Your Majesty's disposal,

1040
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:33,420
this evening. Your Majesty.

1041
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:07,910
I can't believe I'm walking
on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.

1042
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,500
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.

1043
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,380
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.

1044
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,970
Call me Lionel.

1045
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:29,140
True, you... never...

1046
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,560
...called yourself Doctor. I did that...

1047
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:36,110
...for you.

1048
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:40,900
No training.

1049
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,820
No diploma, no...

1050
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:48,370
...qualifications.

1051
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:52,290
Just... a great deal of nerve.

1052
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:55,710
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?

1053
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,710
You asked for trust.

1054
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,260
And... total equality.

1055
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:05,760
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.

1056
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:09,520
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think
you could help that poor man?"

1057
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,060
- What, as a failed actor?
- It's true.

1058
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:18,820
I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.

1059
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:23,360
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.

1060
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:25,030
When the Great War came,

1061
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,660
all our soldiers were returning
to Australia from the front,

1062
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:31,370
a lot of them shell-shocked,
unable to speak.

1063
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,870
Somebody said, Lionel,
"You're very good at this speech stuff.

1064
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,630
Do you think you could possibly
help these poor buggers?"

1065
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,420
I did muscle therapy,
exercises, relaxation,

1066
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,760
but I knew I had to go deeper.

1067
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,760
Those poor young blokes
had cried out in fear.

1068
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,100
No one was listening to them.

1069
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,730
My job was to give them faith
in their own voice,

1070
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:57,440
and let them know that
a friend was listening.

1071
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:01,860
That must ring
a few bells with you, Bertie.

1072
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,450
You give a very noble
account of yourself.

1073
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:12,490
- Make inquiries. It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.

1074
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:16,330
You have no idea who I have
breathing down my neck.

1075
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,090
I vouched for you, and you have no...

1076
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:25,590
- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.

1077
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,010
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.

1078
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,930
Everything I know,
I know from experience.

1079
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:34,640
And that war was some experience.

1080
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,350
My plaque says,
"L. Logue, Speech Defects."

1081
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,440
Not "Doctor."
There are no letters after my name.

1082
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,870
- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.

1083
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,620
- On what charge?
- Fraud.

1084
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:55,370
With war looming, you've saddled
this nation with a voiceless...

1085
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,710
...King. You've destroyed
the happiness of my family,

1086
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:05,010
all for the sake of ensnaring
a star... patient you couldn't...

1087
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:07,590
...possibly hope to assist.

1088
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,640
It'll be like mad...

1089
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:14,560
...King George the Third.

1090
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,980
I'll be... Mad King...

1091
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,270
...George the Stammerer...

1092
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:27,820
...who let his people down
so badly in their hour of need.

1093
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,410
What are you doing? Get up!
You can't sit there! Get up!

1094
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:34,410
- Why not? It's a chair.
- No, it... That is not a chair!

1095
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:36,500
That is... That...

1096
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:40,250
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.

1097
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:41,920
That chair is the seat
on which every King...

1098
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,550
- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!

1099
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:50,260
- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes

1100
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,340
- ...have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

1101
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,720
- Listen to you? By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.

1102
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:55,930
- I am your King!
- No, you're not.

1103
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,310
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.

1104
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,690
Why should I waste my time
listening to you?

1105
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:02,900
Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!

1106
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,860
Yes, you do.

1107
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:23,460
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.

1108
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,840
You'll make a bloody good King.

1109
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:37,390
- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.

1110
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:39,140
Mr. Logue, you must know that

1111
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:43,020
I've found a replacement English
specialist with impeccable credentials.

1112
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,650
Hence, your services
will no longer be required.

1113
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:48,690
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function

1114
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,740
is to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,

1115
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:57,120
- ...but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.

1116
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:03,120
In this personal matter,
I will make my own decision.

1117
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:07,960
My concern is for the head
on which I must place the crown.

1118
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,170
I appreciate that, Archbishop.

1119
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,760
But it's my head.

1120
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,970
Your humble servant.

1121
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:25,770
Thank you, Bertie.

1122
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:31,610
Shall we rehearse? Come on.
Up on your perch.

1123
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,200
Now, when you and Elizabeth
enter through the West door,

1124
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:46,420
you will be greeted by the hymn
"I was glad when they said unto me."

1125
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,800
Actually, you won't be that glad because
they do sing it for a very long time.

1126
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:56,680
Then your friend, the Archbishop,
will ponce up the stairs towards you,

1127
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:02,060
and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty
willing to take the oath?"

1128
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:05,640
- "I am willing."
- Well, of course you are.

1129
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,900
I'm gonna see what this sounds like
in the cheap seats,

1130
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:10,400
so even your old nanny can hear.

1131
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:15,240
"Will you govern your peoples,
Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,

1132
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,240
Australia and New Zealand,

1133
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:22,290
according to their lands and customs?"

1134
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:24,700
- "I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
- Louder.

1135
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:28,580
- I can't hear you up the back.
- "I solemnly promise to do so."

1136
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:31,750
Very good. "And will you, to your power,

1137
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,930
cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be
executed in all your judgments?"

1138
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:38,890
"I will. "I WILL!"

1139
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:42,010
Then there's a very long bit
about upholding the faith. It goes on,

1140
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:44,850
rubbish, rubbish, rubbish,
to which you finally say...

1141
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:50,860
"The things which I have...
here before promised,

1142
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:54,730
I will perform and keep.
So help me God."

1143
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,200
And that's all you say.
Four short responses.

1144
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,700
Kiss the book, sign the oath,
and you're King.

1145
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,450
Easy.

1146
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,720
You nearly crowned him backwards,
Archbishop.

1147
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:25,310
Someone had removed the thread
marking the back of the crown, sir.

1148
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:27,640
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.

1149
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,230
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.

1150
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:37,030
- God save the King.
- Very good.

1151
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:39,280
Very good, Archbishop.

1152
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:43,780
Well, I hope Your Majesties
are thrilled with the result.

1153
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:49,000
- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait. Keep going.

1154
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,460
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.

1155
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,750
Masses of uniformed men,
stupefying to the eye,

1156
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,340
and incredible to the imagination
have stood in spellbound audience...

1157
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:59,970
...of the Fuhrer.


1158
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:14,020
- Papao Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?

1159
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:18,280
I don't know, but he seems
to be saying it rather well.

1160
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,590
Sir... I have asked to see you today

1161
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:46,810
in order to tender my resignation
as Prime Minister.

1162
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:51,600
I'm so sorry to hear that,
Mr. Baldwin.

1163
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:55,360
Neville Chamberlain will
take my place as Prime Minister.

1164
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:00,030
It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.

1165
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:03,660
I have found it impossible to believe

1166
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:07,080
that there is any man in the world

1167
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:12,250
so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1168
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:16,880
that the world may be hurled
for a second time

1169
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,260
into the abyss of destructive war.

1170
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,680
Churchill was right all along.

1171
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,300
This was always Hitler's intention.

1172
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,180
I'm only very sorry to leave you
at this great time of crisis.

1173
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:41,820
I'm very much afraid, sir,
that your greatest test is yet to come.

1174
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:49,410
I am speaking to you...

1175
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:54,620
...from the Cabinet room
at 10 Downing Street.

1176
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:58,960
This morning,
the British ambassador in Berlin

1177
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:03,050
handed the German government
a final note

1178
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:08,800
stating that unless
we heard from them by 11:00,

1179
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:14,020
that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1180
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:17,440
...a state of war would exist between us.


1181
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:25,150
I have to tell you now that
no such undertaking has been received,

1182
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:30,780
and that, consequently, this country
is at war with Germany.

1183
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,880
At last, sir, here is your speech.

1184
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,960
You are on air at six.

1185
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:46,590
I have timed it
to just under nine minutes.

1186
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:49,300
The wording is fully approved.

1187
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:52,100
The Prime Minister
will be joining you for the broadcast,

1188
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,890
which will go out live
across the nation, the Empire

1189
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:58,310
- ...and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.

1190
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:15,620
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.

1191
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:20,040
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.

1192
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:28,300
- Hold it! Hold it!

1193
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,350
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no. Go straight there.

1194
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:36,850
We'll be all right.

1195
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,450
- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.

1196
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:51,700
Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.

1197
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:01,670
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.

1198
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:09,510
- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.

1199
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:12,430
We have about 40 minutes
to the broadcast.

1200
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,850
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1201
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:21,690
There may be dark days ahead...

1202
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,480
...and...
- Try again.

1203
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:33,660
There may be dark days ahead, and...

1204
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:38,290
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say
to yourself, "God save the King."

1205
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:42,040
I say that continuously,
but apparently no one's listening.

1206
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:45,130
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.

1207
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:48,250
Then I'm the solemnest king
who ever lived.

1208
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:52,880
You know, if I'm a king,
where's my power?

1209
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:54,800
Can I... can I form a government?

1210
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:58,260
Can I... can I... levy a tax?

1211
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:00,810
Declare a... a war? No.

1212
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:04,100
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why? Because...

1213
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:07,980
...the nation believes
that when I... I speak,

1214
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:10,320
I speak for them. But I can't speak.

1215
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:15,030
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour."

1216
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:31,300
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1217
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:34,680
Perhaps the most fateful
in our history... Bugger, shit, shit.

1218
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:38,390
I send to every household of my... 

1219
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,350
You see, "P" is always difficult,
even when I'm singing.

1220
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,350
Bounce on to it. "A peoples."

1221
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,230
A people. A people.

1222
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:52,940
Household of my peoples,
both at home

1223
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:55,320
- ...and overseas.
- Beautiful.

1224
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:58,240
This message... Doo-dah

1225
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:01,240
Spoken with the same depth of feeling,
Doo-dah day,

1226
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:04,210
...for each one of you,
as if I were able to...

1227
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:08,840
Shit, fuck, bugger! ...cross your
threshold and speak to you...

1228
01:38:10,130 --> 01:38:12,210
In your head now. "I have a right
to be bloody well heard."

1229
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:15,880
Bloody well heard,
bloody well heard myself!

1230
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:19,050
Now, waltz. Move.
Get continuous movement.

1231
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:23,430
"For the second time
in the lives of most of us...

1232
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,980
- "We are at..."
- "We are," take a pause.

1233
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:30,570
- Lionel, I can't do this.
- Bertie, you can do it.

1234
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,860
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie. It's time.

1235
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:41,530
There he is.

1236
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:52,300
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.

1237
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:55,510
A great moment, Sir.

1238
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,640
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.

1239
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:08,520
Nice to see you... again so soon.

1240
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,900
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you have had...

1241
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,370
- ...a rather busy day.
- I hope we have no more interruptions...

1242
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:25,620
- ...from those damn sirens, sir.
- Or the wretched dogs.

1243
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,290
Congrat... Congratulations.

1244
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:33,000
- First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.

1245
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:39,970
The long... walk.

1246
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,970
Good luck, sir.

1247
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:48,690
I, too, dread this apparatus.

1248
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,900
Had a speech impediment myself,
you know.

1249
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:56,820
- I didn't.
- Family secret. Tongue-tied.

1250
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:59,530
An operation was considered
to be too dangerous.

1251
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:03,320
I eventually made an asset of it.

1252
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,960
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Sir.

1253
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,500
Darling.

1254
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:13,750
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.

1255
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:46,660
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.

1256
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,080
Mr. Wood.

1257
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:55,540
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.

1258
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:00,550
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.

1259
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,890
I'm a thistle-sifter.

1260
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:10,060
I've a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

1261
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:13,770
A sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

1262
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:15,980
- Because I'm...
- Bertie. Darling.

1263
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,190
Make sure it's not switched on.

1264
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,150
Remember, the red light
will blink four times,

1265
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,990
then I've asked them to turn it off.

1266
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:25,110
'Cause we don't want that evil eye
staring at you all the way through.

1267
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,490
One minute, sir.

1268
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:32,660
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

1269
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:46,260
Forty seconds, sir.

1270
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:50,770
Logue.

1271
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,850
However this turns out...

1272
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:58,650
...I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.

1273
01:42:01,530 --> 01:42:03,110
Knighthood?

1274
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:09,240
Twenty seconds.

1275
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:19,290
Forget everything else,
and just say it to me.

1276
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:23,340
Say it to me as a friend.

1277
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,920
In this grave...

1278
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:09,890
...hour...

1279
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:21,770
...perhaps the most fateful
in our history...

1280
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:26,490
...I send...

1281
01:43:26,570 --> 01:43:29,110
...to every household of my...

1282
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:33,740
...a- peoples...

1283
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:38,210
...both at home...

1284
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,420
...and overseas...

1285
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:55,970
...this message...

1286
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:01,690
...spoken with the same
depth of feeling...

1287
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,480
...for each one of you...

1288
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:10,070
...as if I were able
to cross your threshold

1289
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:14,370
and speak to you... myself.

1290
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,790
For the second time
in the lives of most of us...

1291
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,420
...we are... at...

1292
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:26,840
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1293
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,170
...at war.

1294
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:30,590
Very good.

1295
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:36,430
Over and over again...

1296
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,890
...we have tried to find...

1297
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:48,690
...a peaceful way out
of the differences...

1298
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:52,360
...between ourselves...

1299
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:53,990
...and those...

1300
01:44:54,700 --> 01:45:00,040
...who are now our... enemies.

1301
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:06,040
But it has been... in vain.

1302
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,920
We have been forced into a conflict,

1303
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:16,930
for we are called
to meet the challenge of a principle,

1304
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:21,230
which, if it were to prevail,

1305
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:25,860
would be fatal to any civilized order

1306
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:27,980
in the world.

1307
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:31,570
Such a principle,

1308
01:45:31,650 --> 01:45:37,580
stripped of all disguise,

1309
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:40,790
is surely the mere...

1310
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,880
...primitive doctrine that might...

1311
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:51,010
...is right.

1312
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:57,800
For the sake of all
that we ourselves hold dear,

1313
01:45:57,890 --> 01:46:01,470
it is unthinkable

1314
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:06,230
that we should refuse to meet...

1315
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:07,980
...the challenge.

1316
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:15,280
It is to this high purpose

1317
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,030
that I now call

1318
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:22,080
my people at home,

1319
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:26,670
and my peoples across the seas,

1320
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:31,500
who will make our cause their own.

1321
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:36,590
I ask them to stand calm

1322
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,850
and firm and united

1323
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:43,970
in this time of trial.

1324
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:46,810
The task will be hard.

1325
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:51,730
There may be dark days ahead,

1326
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:57,660
and war can no longer be confined

1327
01:46:57,740 --> 01:47:00,030
to the battlefield.

1328
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:03,120
But we can only do the right

1329
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,790
as we see the right,

1330
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:09,830
and reverently commit

1331
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,380
Our cause to God.

1332
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:19,930
If one and all we keep

1333
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:24,930
resolutely faithful to it,

1334
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:30,940
then, with God's help,

1335
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:34,900
we shall... prevail.

1336
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:42,370
[a sigh of relief]

1337
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,630
It was very good, Bertie.

1338
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,230
You still stammered on the "W."

1339
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:14,060
Well, I had to throw in a few,
so they knew it was me.

1340
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:21,950
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.

1341
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:23,740
Thank you, Mr. Wood.

1342
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:29,120
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Sir.

1343
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:33,080
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.

1344
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:44,800
Ready.

1345
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:48,100
- Good?
- Perfect, sir.

1346
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:52,560
Your first wartime speech.

1347
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:54,520
Congratulations.

1348
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:59,690
I expect I shall have to...
do a great deal more.

1349
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:04,780
Thank you, Logue.

1350
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:15,670
Well done.

1351
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,630
My friend.

1352
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,050
Thank you...

1353
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,300
...Your Majesty.

1354
01:49:36,730 --> 01:49:38,520
I knew you'd be good.

1355
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:50,910
Thank you... Lionel.

1356
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,420
Onwards.

1357
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:59,550
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.

1358
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:01,590
Couldn't have
said it better myself, sir.

1359
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:04,680
Your Majesty, I am speechless.

1360
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:08,140
- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.

1361
01:50:10,350 --> 01:50:14,850
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,

1362
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:19,690
- But you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.

1363
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:24,280
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.

1364
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:26,780
Of course I was.

1365
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:29,950
Are we all ready?

1366
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,540
Come on, girls.
