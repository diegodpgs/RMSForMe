...on services for people who had
no right to be here in the first place.

Three billion dollars.

I don't buy that for a minute.

Calling a riot an irrational expression
of rage, that's such a cop-out.

589
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,549
It's opportunism at its worst.
A bunch of people...

...grabbing any excuse they can find
to go and loot a store.

591
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:20,013
The fact these people ripped off stores...

592
00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:22,849
...in their own communities
reflects that these people...

593
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:24,810
...have no respect for the law.

594
00:41:24,977 --> 00:41:29,356

or civic responsibility.

Is that a coincidence or do these people
have a racial commitment to crime?

600

Not only that. They're proud of it.

Yap, yap. You know what?
That's exactly what I hate.

You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

...and alleviating the responsibility that
these people have for their own actions.

It's not crime, it's poverty."

00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:17,571
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit.
It's exactly what happened in this trial too.

610
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:21,158
Because the media twisted things around
so people focused on these cops...

611
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:22,868
...whether they'd get convicted...

612
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:26,163
...and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

613
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,457
Everybody lost sight
of Rodney King himself.

614
00:42:28,624 --> 00:42:31,585
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

615
00:42:31,753 --> 00:42:35,839
He's high as a goddamn kite, driving
120 miles an hour down the highway.

616
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:39,760
He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops,
and he attacks them.

617
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:42,512
He attacked police officers.
Bottom line. And he walked.

618
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,516
And there's some yahoo with a video
camera who turned it on halfway through...

619
00:42:46,684 --> 00:42:48,560
...so all we see is them hitting him.

620
00:42:48,728 --> 00:42:52,773
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up
and cracking him with billy clubs...

621
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,484
...and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull.

622
00:42:55,651 --> 00:42:57,986
And people are going,
"Oh, this poor guy."

623
00:42:58,154 --> 00:42:59,362
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

624
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,449
And those cops end up on the stand
defending themselves...

625
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:05,994
...for using absolutely standard,
textbook self-defense procedures.

626
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:08,121
I don't think the tape showed that at all.

627
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:11,208
You didn't think so?
And what, you're an authority, Ma?

628
00:43:12,251 --> 00:43:13,543
Murray, what do you think?

629
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:19,132
I did think that the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

630
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,636
Who are you to say what's excessive?
I think it was totally appropriate.

631
00:43:22,804 --> 00:43:25,722
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

632
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:30,060
In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain
amount of authority to make those calls...

633
00:43:30,228 --> 00:43:33,980
...because we acknowledge that their job
is difficult and dangerous.

634
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:37,901
You know? Unfortunately,
very few people, like, respect that authority.

635
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:40,904
Look who's talking about respect here,
Mr. Junior-KKK.

636
00:43:41,072 --> 00:43:43,031
- What?
- Davina.

637
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,076
You wanna go to college, Davina?
You should learn to listen.

638
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:49,246
I didn't say I respected laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

639
00:43:49,413 --> 00:43:52,749
I don't respect laws that let monkeys
like Rodney King on the street.

640
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:54,709
Second, I am not, as you well know...

641
00:43:54,877 --> 00:43:59,589
...a member of a low-rent, disorganized
bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

642
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:02,092
Please. So take your head
out of your ass.

643
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,803
You've gotten off the point.

644
00:44:06,097 --> 00:44:09,599
- I had a point. That wasn't the point.
- Do you have one? What is your point?

645
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,601
All right, think about this.

646
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:13,937
If Danny had been
walking across the street...

647
00:44:14,105 --> 00:44:18,483
...and Rodney King had plowed into him...
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

648
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:20,110
Mm-hm.

649
00:44:27,118 --> 00:44:28,910
Who would like some dessert?

650
00:44:30,496 --> 00:44:31,788
We're having a discussion.

651
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:34,207
We're having a nice discussion, right?

652
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:37,043
If Rodney King had been hopped up
on Chivas Regal and PCP...

653
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:39,296
...and killed Danny,
you'd sing a different tune.

654
00:44:39,463 --> 00:44:42,007
I didn't see him hit anybody
and neither did you.

655
00:44:42,174 --> 00:44:43,925
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

656
00:44:44,093 --> 00:44:47,178
- Thank God.
- Keep it down, okay? Ally's sleeping.

657
00:44:50,141 --> 00:44:53,977
If he had, though? Come on, think about it.
If that monkey had run some kid over...

658
00:44:54,145 --> 00:44:57,063
...everybody would have a different
opinion of this matter.

659
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:59,941
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

660
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:02,402
But instead, he just attacked a few cops.

661
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,448
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across
America for this total son of a bitch.

662
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:07,824
I mean, it blows my mind.

663
00:45:07,992 --> 00:45:09,993
We're hung up on this notion
we have some...

664
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:12,746
...obligation to help
the struggling black man.

665
00:45:12,914 --> 00:45:16,499
Cut him some slack until he can overcome
these historical injustices.

666
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:19,085
It's crap. This stuff you guys
are saying perpetuates it.

667
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,629
All this liberal nonsense.

668
00:45:20,796 --> 00:45:24,174
Everyone's looking the other way
while our country rots from inside out.

669
00:45:24,342 --> 00:45:28,011
Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves,
what, like, 130 years ago?

670
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:30,764
How long does it take
to get your act together?

671
00:45:30,932 --> 00:45:33,850
Well, Jews have been persecuted
for over 5000 years.

672
00:45:34,018 --> 00:45:37,771
Are you saying that it's wrong
to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

673
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,192
STACEY: Forget that. I'm with you.
I am with you all the way, baby.

674
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,196
- I'm sick of these liberal hypocrites.
- Here we go again. I love this part.

675
00:45:46,364 --> 00:45:49,282
Well, look at the way that they
scapegoated Chief Gates.

676
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,952
They'd come down that hard
on black Willie Williams?

677
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,497
- No way. The video was a setup.
- Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused?

678
00:45:55,873 --> 00:45:58,041
- Yes.
- No, you cannot. Don't interrupt.

679
00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:01,044
Excuse me, I was talking.
I listened to you.

680
00:46:01,212 --> 00:46:02,712
The hell do you think you are?

681
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,799
- She's in the middle of a point.
- Who do you think you are?

682
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:07,092
- Sit down!
- No. Fuck you!

683
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:09,511
DEREK: Sit down! Shut up!
MURRAY: Derek, calm down.

684
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:11,012
- Sit down!
- Derek, calm down.

685
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,556
- Shut up!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

686
00:46:13,724 --> 00:46:15,558
- Sit your ass down! No.
- Fuck you, move!

687
00:46:15,726 --> 00:46:17,978
- Sit down, shut up!
- Get out of my way! Move!

688
00:46:18,145 --> 00:46:19,354
Goddamn it, Derek, move!

689
00:46:19,522 --> 00:46:21,648
Shut your mouth
and give my girlfriend respect.

690
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:24,067
Derek, what are you trying to prove?

691
00:46:24,235 --> 00:46:27,904
Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey.
Where do you think you're going?

692
00:46:28,072 --> 00:46:31,950
- Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go!
DEREK: Come here!

693
00:46:32,118 --> 00:46:34,369
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina.

694
00:46:34,537 --> 00:46:37,414
- Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
- Derek!

695
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:39,082
Stop!

696
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,292
She can't breathe!

697
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:43,545
DORIS:
Let her go!

698
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:45,463
Are you gonna apologize?

699
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:47,799
Are you gonna apologize? Are you?

700
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:49,217
You're a fucking asshole.

701
00:46:50,011 --> 00:46:51,928
I hate you!

702
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:02,772
What are you doing, Derek?
This is your family.

703
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,443
Right, my family. So you know what?
I don't give two shits about you...

704
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:10,030
...anybody else or what you think.
You're not part of it, never will be.

705
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:12,449
- That has nothing to do with it!
DEREK: It doesn't?

706
00:47:12,616 --> 00:47:14,200
You don't think I see
what you're doing?

707
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:17,954
You think I'll sit here and smile while
some kike tries to fuck my mother?

708
00:47:18,706 --> 00:47:19,998
It's never gonna happen!

709
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:23,168
Fucking forget it. Not on my watch.
Not while I'm in this family.

710
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:26,463
I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off
and stick it up your ass...

711
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,965
...before I let that happen.
Coming in here...

712
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:33,970
...and poisoning my family's dinner with
your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!

713
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,477
Fuck you!

714
00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:42,437
Yeah, walk out.

715
00:47:42,605 --> 00:47:44,731
Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading
motherfucker!

716
00:47:44,899 --> 00:47:46,441
Get the fuck out of my house!

717
00:47:51,614 --> 00:47:53,615
You see this?
That means "not welcome."

718
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:07,921
- What did I do?
- You disgust me!

719
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:10,256
You disgust me! Bring him to our table!

720
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:12,175
Primping your hair and your dress!

721
00:48:13,177 --> 00:48:16,429
- Don't touch me! All tarted up!
- What did I do to you?

722
00:48:16,597 --> 00:48:20,058
How could you bring him to Dad's table?
How could you go from Dad to that?

723
00:48:20,226 --> 00:48:21,351
Aren't you ashamed?

724
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,813
I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!

725
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:32,028
Go run to your fucking kike!
Go run to him!

726
00:48:37,243 --> 00:48:40,203
It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby.

727
00:48:47,044 --> 00:48:48,711
I'm so sorry, Doris.

728
00:48:49,213 --> 00:48:51,047
I really am.

729
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:02,392
- He's gone.
- He's just a boy...

730
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,644
...without a father.

731
00:49:05,396 --> 00:49:08,481
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

732
00:49:18,742 --> 00:49:20,201
Goodbye.

733
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:07,081
Hey. You all right?

734
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:12,712
- Take this, you fucking dick!
- Hey, no. No, no, come here!

735
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,047
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!

736
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:15,423
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

737
00:50:15,591 --> 00:50:16,966
Let me go, goddamn it!

738
00:50:17,134 --> 00:50:19,135
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

739
00:50:20,888 --> 00:50:23,014
I would never hurt you. You know that.

740
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:25,225
Come on, I screwed up. I lost control.

741
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:26,809
It's not you.

742
00:50:26,977 --> 00:50:28,311
I'm sorry.

743
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,647
Come on, I'd never hurt you guys.
I'd never hurt you.

744
00:50:30,814 --> 00:50:32,774
You know that. I'd do anything for you.

745
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:34,150
I don't believe you.

746
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,402
I trust you, Derek.

747
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:39,739
[FRONT DOOR OPENS]

748
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,455
Hi.

749
00:50:47,623 --> 00:50:50,083
Hi. What are you doing out of bed, huh?

750
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:52,168
- Want a plane ride?
- Yeah.

751
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:54,170
DANNY:
Going for takeoff.

752
00:50:55,714 --> 00:50:58,549
- Woo-hoo!
- Heh-heh-heh.

753
00:50:58,717 --> 00:50:59,801
Oh, no.

754
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:01,803
No, no! Don't crash!

755
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,514
Gotta go to Mom.

756
00:51:04,682 --> 00:51:06,516
She's a crazy flier.

757
00:51:06,684 --> 00:51:10,353
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

758
00:51:11,146 --> 00:51:12,689

Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.

1515
01:47:56,548 --> 01:47:59,258
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.

1516
01:47:59,426 --> 01:48:01,928
I'm going like this to keep
my family in the clear.

1517
01:48:02,096 --> 01:48:04,555
- Don't ask me to fix this.
- I'm not asking that.

1518
01:48:04,723 --> 01:48:08,643
- It was there before me.
- You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1519
01:48:08,811 --> 01:48:11,062
You take a break, you'll find no peace.

1520
01:48:11,230 --> 01:48:13,606
The way to find peace is to stick.

1521
01:48:14,441 --> 01:48:16,776
It's not gonna make
a fucking bit of difference.

1522
01:48:16,944 --> 01:48:18,486
It might.

1523
01:48:19,905 --> 01:48:22,281
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you?

1524
01:48:22,449 --> 01:48:25,535
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever is in your power to do.

All right.

You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

1530

- I doubt it.
- Yeah, well...

1531
01:48:47,141 --> 01:48:50,518
...we're all gonna have a laugh at that,
let me tell you.

1532
01:48:50,686 --> 01:48:53,938
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

Come on.

SWEENEY: Hey, you. You got
something good for me this morning?

1535
01:48:59,111 --> 01:49:02,655
- I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
- Yeah, okay.

What's going on?

1537

Come on.

01:49:31,351 --> 01:49:34,353
This is so bad for Seth, man.

1539
01:49:34,521 --> 01:49:37,690
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
- I don't know.

1540
01:49:37,858 --> 01:49:40,860
I'm glad they're not dead,
but other than that, I don't care.

1541
01:49:41,695 --> 01:49:42,987
Should we visit them?

1542
01:49:43,155 --> 01:49:45,281
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.

1543
01:49:45,449 --> 01:49:47,784
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

1544
01:49:47,951 --> 01:49:49,744
Listen, too...

1545
01:49:49,912 --> 01:49:53,956
...I saw a car cruising by the house last
night when I pulled out of there with Seth.

1546
01:49:54,124 --> 01:49:56,918
If you get home before me,
look around the street, all right?

1547
01:49:57,085 --> 01:49:59,045
Make sure there's nothing going on.

01:50:00,464 --> 01:50:02,340
Oh, man. This is bad.

- They're after you, man.
- It'll cool off.

1550
01:50:07,805 --> 01:50:09,472
If I made it through Chino...

1551

Okay.

What are you gonna do?

1555
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:23,361
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.

1556
01:50:23,529 --> 01:50:25,655
Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.

01:50:25,823 --> 01:50:27,657
It's gonna be fine.

- Derek, no!
- Get out of my way!

- All right. All right.

No.

Oh, no, no. No.

Oh, Jesus.

Oh, God.

01:54:01,955 --> 01:54:04,582
DANNY: So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1581
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:07,126
My conclusion, right?

1582
01:54:07,961 --> 01:54:10,046
Well, my conclusion is...

1583
01:54:10,213 --> 01:54:12,214
...hate is baggage.

1584
01:54:12,466 --> 01:54:15,760
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1585
01:54:16,303 --> 01:54:18,179
It's just not worth it.

1586
01:54:20,974 --> 01:54:24,101
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1587
01:54:24,603 --> 01:54:26,645
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1588
01:54:26,813 --> 01:54:31,317
...so if you can't top it,
steal from them and go out strong.

1589
01:54:31,485 --> 01:54:34,153
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

1590
01:54:35,739 --> 01:54:39,116
"We are not enemies, but friends.

1591
01:54:39,284 --> 01:54:41,702
We must not be enemies.

1592
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:44,080
Though passion may have strained...

1593
01:54:44,247 --> 01:54:47,500
...it must not break
our bonds of affection.

1594
01:54:47,667 --> 01:54:52,505
The mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched...

1595
01:54:52,672 --> 01:54:57,301
...as surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature."
