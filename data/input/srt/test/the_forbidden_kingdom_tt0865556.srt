1
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,306
What's going on, Hop?

2
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,875
You back again?

3
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,486
Oh, sick!

4
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,386
Find good one?

5
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,790
Ten Tigers of Kwangtung.
This is gold.

6
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:02,292
Bride With White Hair.
Chinese, no subtitles.

7
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,893
You have any early Shaw Brothers?
This one guy does Leopard style...

8
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,599
Leopard style, Dragon style...

9
00:05:08,947 --> 00:05:12,604
...fly through air
...fight on water.

10
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,881
Crouching Tiger...
Spanking Monkey.

11
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:17,983
I know you.

12
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,280
Another white boy
who wants to know gongfu.

13
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:25,380
Kick the ass.
Get the girls.

14
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,098
Only storage back here.

15
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,906
- Where did you get this?
- It was here...

16
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:21,108
...when my grandfather
opened this shop.

17
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,215
A hundred years ago.

18
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:28,178
He waited for a man
to come pick it up...

19
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,684
...return to rightful owner.

20
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:35,087
Man never came.

21
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:39,587
My father took over the shop.
Waited, too.

22
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,699
Long time. Now me.

23
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:45,694
That's a Northern
Temple-style bo staff.

24
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:48,903
The kind the 13 monks
used to save the Tang Emperor.

25
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,098
I've seen it before.

26
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:54,302
That exact one.
I've had dreams about it.

27
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:56,208
You know why?

28
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:59,475
You watch too much
"Hong Kong Phooey".

29
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:00,879
Come.

30
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:05,682
I give you five awesome
Bruce Lee movie...

31
00:07:06,323 --> 00:07:08,291
...for very sick price.

32
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:10,189
You're the man, Hop.

33
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,207
Jason!

34
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,203
What's up?

35
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:30,973
- Not much. Just cruising.
- I mean Chinatown.

36
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:32,082
What's with that?

37
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:35,583
- Gongfu.
- Are you serious?

38
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,279
I can't talk about it...
gongfu code.

39
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:42,381
Look... the new kid's marking time
with the hoodsies.

40
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,994
You still riding
this loser cruiser?

41
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,290
Get a motor for this shit.

42
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:51,097
- What we got here?
- Just some bootlegs.

43
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:52,998
Enter the Dragon.

44
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:57,399
- Bride With White Hair?
- That's actually very good.

45
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:02,810
Let him go.
He knows gongfu.

46
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:05,177
What?
You think you're Chinese?

47
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:07,784
You hang out
with them Chinks in C-town?

48
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:10,678
What's up with you?
Let's see some, man.

49
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:14,484
Come on. Let's see some gongfu.
Gongfu master.

50
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:17,994
Want some tae kwon do, huh?

51
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:23,893
Yo, Lupo.

52
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:26,696
He hangs out with
that Chink who cashes checks.

53
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:32,706
You in tight with the old man?

54
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:38,779
Just shut up and do it!

55
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,481
It's late.
He's probably gone.

56
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:55,389
- He's not here. Let's go.
- Who's there?

57
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,497
Gongfu boy.

58
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:01,298
You back for
more good-price movie?

59
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:12,873
I told you... best deal
in Chinatown. Come in.

60
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:16,079
Want some tea?

61
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,084
Red Sox game is on.

62
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:22,984
Yankees winning. Very bad.

63
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:31,397
- Who is with you? Friend?
- Where do you keep the cash?

64
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,600
Where's the cash?

65
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:41,210
Come on, old man!

66
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:43,870
You stay here!

67
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,094
I found your Xbox.

68
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,302
Hop!

69
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,104
Jesus, Lupo!

70
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:14,606
- What the hell?
- You shot him!

71
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,210
Take it.

72
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:19,679
Must return to rightful owner.

73
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:21,180
Run.

74
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:24,685
You didn't see that.

75
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,778
You didn't see that!

76
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:39,195
Come here, you little shit!

77
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:50,668
Lupo, come on, man!

78
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,279
- You didn't see nothing!
- Calm down.

79
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,974
- Hey, chill. Man. Put the gun down.
- Shut up!

80
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:58,086
I pulled the trigger,
but we're in this together!

81
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,882
But this little cockroach
ain't one of us!

82
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:18,199
Excuse me.
I don't know where I am.

83
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:22,592
I don't know how I got here.
I remember falling.

84
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,489
What? This?

85
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,289
You want this?

86
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,604
I don't know
what you're saying.

87
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:44,367
I can't understand you!

88
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:49,573
That's because
you're not listening!

89
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:52,679
Behind you!

90
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,580
I don't know where I am...

91
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:31,986
...how I got here, or who those guys
trying to kill me were.

92
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,491
But what you did
back there was sick.

93
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:37,596
No. Drunken Fist.

94
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,392
Secret gongfu from the South.

95
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:44,197
I am Lu Yan, traveling scholar.

96
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,705
What land do you
come from, monk?

97
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,704
I'm not a monk.

98
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:52,777
I'm Jason Tripikitas,
from South Boston.

99
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,079
Is this a dream?

100
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:57,580
No.

101
00:15:57,717 --> 00:16:00,584
Where you came from
is the dream.

102
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,280
Through the Gate of No Gate.

103
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:06,187
Is that like a wormhole
or something?

104
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:09,591
No. It means
you are either a Zen master

105
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:12,395
or you carry something
very special.

106
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:13,794
This?

107
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:17,498
It was in a pawn shop,
waiting for a man to pick it up...

108
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:20,904
...and return it
to its rightful owner.

109
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,200
What?

110
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:25,369
It's long been foretold...

111
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,871
...that a seeker will come...

112
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:33,281
...to return the staff and
end the reign of the Jade Warlord.

113
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,284
Return it to who?

114
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:37,790
The Monkey King.

115
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:39,892
Born of a stone...

116
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,392
...on a mountain of
fruit and flowers.

117
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:48,089
<i>With his weapon in hand,
his qi became like fire...</i>

118
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:50,702
<i>... his stick fighting like magic.</i>

119
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:53,499
<i>He defied the order of the land...</i>

120
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,972
<i>... but the Jade Army
could not defeat him.</i>

121
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,793
<i>The Monkey King crushed
every soldier sent to stop him.</i>

122
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:24,596
<i>With his magical staff
he was unbeatable.</i>

123
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:29,507
<i>Word of his disobedience traveled deep
within the Forbidden Kingdom...</i>

124
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:33,976
<i>... to the Five Elements Mountain,
land of the immortals.</i>

125
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:36,375
<i>Once every 500 years...</i>

126
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,574
<i>... the Jade Emperor hosts
the Peach Banquet.</i>

127
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:44,177
<i>Here, the heavenly ministers
gather to celebrate their longevity...</i>

128
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:47,484
<i>... and drink
the elixir of immortality.</i>

129
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:52,795
<i>One sip of this heavenly brew
will give everlasting life...</i>

130
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,491
<i>... free from mortal suffering
and desire.</i>

131
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,269
<i>Into the banquet,
the Monkey King crashed, uninvited.</i>

132
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:11,870
<i>The Jade Emperor was enchanted
by the Monkey King.</i>

133
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:15,383
<i>But the Jade Warlord
was not amused.</i>

134
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,077
<i>As master of the army,</i>

135
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,180
<i>the Warlord demanded that
the Monkey King bow down to him.</i>

136
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:33,599
He's a bit unrefined,
that's all.

137
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,971
Give the naughty monkey a title
and let him go.

138
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:45,282
<i>Satisfied all was well
in heaven and earth...</i>

139
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,682
<i>... the supremely high Emperor left to
begin his 500 years meditation...</i>

140
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,484
<i>... leaving the Jade Warlord in charge
by mandate of heaven.</i>

141
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,185
<i>Rather than obey
the Jade Emperor's command...</i>

142
00:18:57,328 --> 00:19:00,388
<i>... the Warlord challenged
the Monkey King to a duel.</i>

143
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:05,892
<i>High atop Five Elements Mountain
in the Warlord's palace...</i>

144
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:08,197
<i>... the battle of
immortals was fought...</i>

145
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,469
<i>... to prove once and for all
whose skills were supreme.</i>

146
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,202
Most excellent stick fighting,
Sun Wukong.

147
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:58,272
But without your weapon,
you're just a lowly hermit!

148
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:02,372
No more weapons.
No more qi magic.

149
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:05,671
Fist against fist.

150
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:10,583
<i>The Monkey King was too trusting
and believed the Warlord...</i>

151
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,880
<i>... laying down his magic weapon.</i>

152
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:22,187
<i>Realizing he'd been tricked,
the Monkey King</i>

153
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:24,697
<i>cast the staff out into
the Middle Kingdom.</i>

154
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:46,479
Martial art is
based on deception...

155
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:48,487
...my friend.

156
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:57,496
<i>Being immortal, the Monkey King
could not be killed...</i>

157
00:22:57,632 --> 00:23:01,591
<i>... only trapped in stone,
where he waits for the seeker...</i>

158
00:23:01,737 --> 00:23:05,673
<i>... to return his great weapon to him
and finally free him.</i>

159
00:23:16,518 --> 00:23:18,679
That's what I heard, anyway.

160
00:23:20,322 --> 00:23:21,789
A long time ago.

161
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:25,290
- How long has he been imprisoned?
- Five hundred years,

162
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:27,793
give or take a few decades.

163
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:32,491
They say when the Monkey King is free,
the Jade Emperor will return.

164
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:35,603
How do I get home?

165
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:39,468
You must return the staff to
Five Elements Mountain.

166
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:41,974
You must free the Monkey King.

167
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,476
I can't free the Monkey King.
I have to get home.

168
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:46,581
Innkeeper! More wine.

169
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:48,979
Geez, Don't you think
you had one too many?

170
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:51,886
Wine is my inspiration.

171
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,080
In some parts,
I am known as the Poet.

172
00:23:55,223 --> 00:23:56,383
Ganbei.

173
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:02,795
In other parts,
I am known as the Beggar.

174
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:28,689
- What do we now?
- How good is your gongfu?

175
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:33,988
He who speaks does not know.
He who knows does not speak.

176
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:36,393
Surely, you are masterful.

177
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:45,170
- Where'd you get that weapon?
- It's a fake.

178
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:47,969
You can find anything
these days on the Silk Road.

179
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:49,770
Out of the way, old fool.

180
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:54,481
Hand it over.

181
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:59,483
Hand over the weapon...
or die.

182
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:13,191
Go!

183
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:47,993
Lu, help!

184
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,187
Protect yourself!

185
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:24,791
Let's go!

186
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:42,576
Where are you going?

187
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:46,182
- Jump!
- I don't think so!

188
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,583
Don't think! Just do!

189
00:27:58,631 --> 00:27:59,791
Come on!

190
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:10,869
Thank you!

191
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:20,681
Such skill!

192
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,378
Are you from
the north mountains?

193
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:24,888
She is Golden Sparrow,
from the south.

194
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:22,572
You saved our lives back there.

195
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:24,681
I don't know what we would
have done if you hadn't come along.

196
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:25,873
She does nothing.

197
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,780
The Drunken Immortal
did not need his life saved.

198
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,082
You're immortal?

199
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:33,983
What do you run from, child?

200
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:38,789
Bounty hunters trying to stop her
from reaching Five Elements Mountain.

201
00:29:44,902 --> 00:29:49,566
I suggest you keep riding west
and only stop to water your horses.

202
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:50,366
You're not coming?

203
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:54,376
The journey to the mountain
crosses barrens and deserts.

204
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:55,672
Unspeakable dangers.

205
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:57,280
Worst of all, no wine.

206
00:29:57,414 --> 00:30:00,474
His elixir.
Every immortal has one.

207
00:30:00,618 --> 00:30:02,586
I'm very sorry.
Without wine, I would perish.

208
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,278
You must understand this.

209
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:07,390
No. You must understand this.

210
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:08,992
This is insane!

211
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:11,991
- Do you wish to get home?
- Yes.

212
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:15,193
Then listen well!

213
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:18,768
If you die here, you'll be found
dead in the world you left behind.

214
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:20,268
Do you understand?

215
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:26,971
My jug is getting low.
I must say good-bye. Bye-bye.

216
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,981
Lu!

217
00:30:37,321 --> 00:30:38,481
Wait!

218
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:43,587
Let him go. You are the one
to return the staff, not him.

219
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:45,891
How good is your gongfu?

220
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,999
He has no gongfu. None!

221
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:50,361
Lu, wait!

222
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:52,163
Teach me.

223
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:54,464
Teach me to fight!

224
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:07,379
Swing soft, cut hard!
At the same time!

225
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:10,186
He's terrible.

226
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,093
I've been your weed-whacker
for two days...

227
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:19,788
...while you sit like
the King of England.

228
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,488
When do I learn gongfu?

229
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,964
- You want to learn gongfu?
- Yeah.

230
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:30,070
I'll teach you gongfu.

231
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,872
That's a strike.
Tomorrow I'll teach you to block.

232
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:37,275
Let's go!

233
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,478
Swing soft. Cut hard.

234
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:04,171
Will I learn the No Shadow Kick?

235
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:08,277
And the Buddha Palm Technique?

236
00:32:10,414 --> 00:32:15,374
There's a guy in "Virtual Fighter 2"
who uses Buddha Palm... thanks, Lu...

237
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,487
...and he does the...

238
00:32:18,422 --> 00:32:20,083
...Iron Elbow...

239
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,782
...and One-Fingered Death Touch.

240
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:25,792
The cup's full.
Stop! It's full.

241
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:31,256
Exactly. How can you fill your cup
if already full?

242
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,063
How can you learn gongfu?
You already know so much.

243
00:32:35,604 --> 00:32:37,970
No Shadow Kick.
Buddha Palm!

244
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,165
Empty your cup.

245
00:32:45,314 --> 00:32:48,477
Hopeless. It is hopeless.

246
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:11,765
It is said that music...

247
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:16,273
...is a bridge
between earth and heaven.

248
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,879
That's beautiful.

249
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:27,689
It belonged to her mother.

250
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,265
My Lord...

251
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:18,662
How dare you...
can't you see I am busy?

252
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,674
The divine staff of legend.

253
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,675
It was seen in the Middle Kingdom.

254
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:25,977
Impossible.

255
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:30,574
The villagers are beginning to
whisper of prophecy.

256
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:38,887
Mortals are always
whispering of prophecy.

257
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:41,086
It's their opium.

258
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,664
What other offending news
do you have for me?

259
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,569
That is all, My Lord.

260
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:04,779
Summon the Witch...
the one born of wolves.

261
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,654
Where were we?

262
00:35:31,313 --> 00:35:32,473
Lu Yan?

263
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,877
Lu Yan?

264
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:43,090
Lu Yan?

265
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,587
Lu Yan!

266
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,560
Sparrow!

267
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:39,169
- Are you all right?
- Jason, what happened?

268
00:36:39,312 --> 00:36:41,473
He took it! The staff!

269
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:46,183
The Jade Warlord
has sent a bounty hunter.

270
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:47,786
We are doomed.

271
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,363
That's his horse.
He must be inside.

272
00:37:03,203 --> 00:37:05,364
Why would he take
refuge in a temple?

273
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:08,963
That's what I intend to find out.
Wait with the horses.

274
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:42,573
Ah! Good to get off my feet.

275
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,268
Long day.

276
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:47,980
So, where are you from?

277
00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:49,775
Shandong Province?

278
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:53,477
You look like
the Shandong Province type.

279
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,178
You come here often?

280
00:37:57,423 --> 00:37:59,891
That staff doesn't belong to you.

281
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:06,362
You have to give it to me,
or somebody might get hurt.

282
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:28,772
What kind of monk are you? Huh?

283
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:31,475
Stealing from travelers.

284
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:36,183
A silent one, I see.

285
00:39:37,523 --> 00:39:38,990
Or deaf.

286
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:42,890
I'm speaking to you, monk!

287
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:24,554
Praying Mantis.
Very good...

288
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:27,858
...for catching bugs.
But not tiger!

289
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:27,183
You try to steal
the staff for the Warlord!

290
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:28,783
No, fool!

291
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:34,377
I'm on a mission to find
the seeker of the staff.

292
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:54,666
You found him.

293
00:44:08,624 --> 00:44:10,057
He's not even Chinese.

294
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:13,252
We are all the same inside,
aren't we, Monk?

295
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:14,953
Heaven help us.

296
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,361
What, you find it a sin?

297
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,459
Yes, it is sinful not to share.

298
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:23,969
Cheers!

299
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:13,385
How long have you
searched for the staff?

300
00:45:13,522 --> 00:45:15,888
As long as I can remember.

301
00:45:18,694 --> 00:45:21,162
An old man and boy.
They took tea here. Yes?

302
00:45:21,296 --> 00:45:24,060
A Soldier Monk rides with them.

303
00:45:24,399 --> 00:45:26,162
Who else?

304
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:28,360
I do not know who you speak of.

305
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,589
Men are such liars.

306
00:46:03,105 --> 00:46:04,868
Sparrow.

307
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,275
Sparrow...

308
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,674
...where do you nest?

309
00:46:28,396 --> 00:46:30,455
Jason, go deeper!

310
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,161
Must taste bitter before sweet.
Horse stance. Grow roots.

311
00:46:47,315 --> 00:46:48,680
Horse stance.

312
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,987
Very good...
for taking a dump.

313
00:46:55,924 --> 00:46:57,357
Enough from you!

314
00:46:57,492 --> 00:46:59,858
He's my student, not yours!

315
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:02,555
Two tigers cannot live
on the same mountain.

316
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:05,564
Two masters cannot teach
the same student!

317
00:47:08,103 --> 00:47:09,263
Ma bu!

318
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:13,167
If he is really
to learn the gongfu...

319
00:47:13,306 --> 00:47:16,571
...he must develop speed,
accuracy and power.

320
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,177
Hey! I know that.

321
00:47:19,312 --> 00:47:22,372
It's the Way of the Intercepting Fist.
Bruce Lee?

322
00:47:29,522 --> 00:47:32,150
I will punch. You block.

323
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:33,452
Ready?

324
00:47:37,197 --> 00:47:39,358
What did I teach you
about the Snake?

325
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:41,967
Now you punch me.

326
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:45,466
See?

327
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,467
Again. You punch him again.
Snake!

328
00:47:53,513 --> 00:47:56,778
He's not ready for Snake.
Perhaps Eagle.

329
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,781
Crane! Crane!

330
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,279
Okay?

331
00:48:11,297 --> 00:48:12,457
Stop!

332
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:14,557
I've had enough!

333
00:48:14,701 --> 00:48:18,569
No more!
No more silent riddles!

334
00:48:18,705 --> 00:48:20,366
And no more empty cups!

335
00:48:25,211 --> 00:48:27,975
First, you show respect
to your teachers!

336
00:48:30,216 --> 00:48:34,380
So... What about the two tigers
on one mountain?

337
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:37,655
We can kill each other
when it's over.

338
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:52,563
<i>Gongfu. Hard work over time
to accomplish skill.</i>

339
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:00,070
<i>A painter can have gongfu.</i>

340
00:49:00,213 --> 00:49:04,081
<i>Or the butcher who cuts meat
every day with such skill...</i>

341
00:49:04,217 --> 00:49:06,879
<i>... his knife never touches bone.</i>

342
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,949
<i>Learn the form,
but seek the formless.</i>

343
00:49:15,094 --> 00:49:17,062
<i>Hear the soundless.</i>

344
00:49:17,196 --> 00:49:20,962
<i>Learn it all, then forget it all.</i>

345
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,867
<i>Learn The Way,
then find your own way.</i>

346
00:49:26,306 --> 00:49:28,467
<i>The musician can have gongfu.</i>

347
00:49:28,608 --> 00:49:31,577
<i>Or the poet
who paints pictures with words</i>

348
00:49:31,711 --> 00:49:33,576
<i>and makes emperors weep.</i>

349
00:49:33,713 --> 00:49:36,273
<i>This, too, is gongfu.</i>

350
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:40,785
<i>But do not name it, my friend,
for it is like water.</i>

351
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,081
<i>Nothing is softer than water...</i>

352
00:49:43,222 --> 00:49:45,952
<i>... yet it can overcome rock.</i>

353
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:51,052
<i>It does not fight.
It flows around the opponent.</i>

354
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:56,157
<i>Formless, nameless
the true master dwells within.</i>

355
00:49:56,302 --> 00:49:59,066
<i>Only you can free him.</i>

356
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:05,259
Behold the tyranny of the Warlord.

357
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:07,662
He must be stopped.

358
00:51:07,805 --> 00:51:12,071
He must be killed for his crimes
and his head put on a post.

359
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:17,070
One must not feel hatred
towards him, or he wins.

360
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,783
If he speaks of compassion
for this devil...

361
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:24,847
...he should go back to
his temple and pray.

362
00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:28,855
Our mission is not one of peace.

363
00:51:28,993 --> 00:51:33,259
Go back to your mother and father.
You are but a child.

364
00:51:33,898 --> 00:51:35,559
They are dead.

365
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:39,967
And she's not a child.

366
00:51:41,605 --> 00:51:43,266
Not anymore.

367
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:51,270
Her father was a government official
who opposed the Warlord.

368
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:55,681
<i>And so, to set an example...</i>

369
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,551
<i>... the Warlord dispatched
his troops into the night.</i>

370
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:08,259
<i>Legion upon legion poured out of
the Five Elements Mountain...</i>

371
00:52:08,399 --> 00:52:11,459
<i>... into the lowlands of
the Middle Kingdom.</i>

372
00:52:12,903 --> 00:52:16,964
<i>Screams of innocent people
hung in the night air.</i>

373
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:24,873
<i>When it was over,
charred ruins were all that remained.</i>

374
00:52:25,316 --> 00:52:30,344
<i>That, and a lonely child,
hidden in the well by her mother...</i>

375
00:52:30,688 --> 00:52:33,748
<i>... ruthlessly murdered by an arrow...</i>

376
00:52:35,392 --> 00:52:38,259
<i>... from the Warlord's bow.</i>

377
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,668
When she reaches
the Warlord's palace...

378
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:50,872
...she will not
offer him forgiveness...

379
00:52:51,308 --> 00:52:52,866
...monk.

380
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,175
She will offer him...

381
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:57,280
...this...

382
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:07,348
...a jade dart
that can kill an immortal.

383
00:53:08,192 --> 00:53:11,457
Long has she practiced.

384
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:19,658
Vengeance has a way of
rebounding upon oneself.

385
00:53:25,009 --> 00:53:27,273
Master of sensitivity.

386
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:42,154
It is them.
They're headed towards the desert.

387
00:53:42,593 --> 00:53:46,359
They are between me
and the River of Sand.

388
00:53:46,797 --> 00:53:50,563
Isn't it just like King Monkey?

389
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:55,161
Summoning a boy to do a man's job?

390
00:54:09,987 --> 00:54:13,354
Damn. This desert is hot.

391
00:54:14,692 --> 00:54:16,956
This is not a desert.

392
00:54:17,094 --> 00:54:19,961
That is the desert!

393
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:26,160
I hope you know
where you're going!

394
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,861
Crazy monk.

395
00:55:45,314 --> 00:55:47,179
A monk on a mission!

396
00:55:47,316 --> 00:55:51,548
And where does he lead us?
Across a desert to nowhere!

397
00:56:17,212 --> 00:56:19,180
We're not going to make it,
are we?

398
00:56:23,118 --> 00:56:26,349
Even if we do,
we still must face the Jade Army.

399
00:56:29,091 --> 00:56:31,150
What if I can't handle it?

400
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:39,262
What if I freeze?

401
00:56:43,605 --> 00:56:46,267
Don't forget to breathe.

402
00:57:19,007 --> 00:57:23,068
If we don't find water soon,
we will perish.

403
00:57:25,113 --> 00:57:29,573
Perhaps a Taoist immortal
can make rain.

404
00:57:31,086 --> 00:57:35,147
If he truly is a Taoist immortal.

405
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:04,274
You are an insult to
the name of Buddha! Blasphemy!

406
00:59:07,313 --> 00:59:08,473
No!

407
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:12,142
I lead you to the mountain!

408
00:59:13,786 --> 00:59:15,344
Out there!

409
01:00:24,691 --> 01:00:26,249
Can you see them...

410
01:00:26,893 --> 01:00:28,656
...in the clouds?

411
01:00:29,095 --> 01:00:31,154
A two-headed lion.

412
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:33,365
Right there.

413
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,265
See?

414
01:00:35,902 --> 01:00:37,267
Yeah, I see.

415
01:00:39,205 --> 01:00:42,174
See that one?
There, coming up behind it?

416
01:00:42,609 --> 01:00:43,974
Like a wave?

417
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:47,370
Looks like the Green Monster.

418
01:00:47,714 --> 01:00:51,241
Green monster?
You mean dragon.

419
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,044
No, I mean Fenway Park.

420
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:57,456
They call the left field fence
the Green Monster.

421
01:00:57,991 --> 01:00:59,356
It's true.

422
01:01:02,295 --> 01:01:04,957
It does kind of look like
a dragon, though.

423
01:01:09,202 --> 01:01:13,468
Have you family,
back in this land you come from?

424
01:01:15,308 --> 01:01:16,468
My mother.

425
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:18,875
Father?

426
01:01:20,313 --> 01:01:21,871
Never knew him.

427
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:25,742
Do you ever long for him?

428
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:29,646
Wonder who he was?

429
01:01:32,592 --> 01:01:35,959
Maybe the only thing
I've ever been good at...

430
01:01:37,397 --> 01:01:39,262
...is pretending I don't.

431
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:43,866
She is sorry.

432
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:50,171
How romantic.

433
01:01:52,211 --> 01:01:55,669
Men will tell you
what you want to hear, Sparrow.

434
01:01:55,815 --> 01:01:59,749
But in the end,
they will leave you with nothing.

435
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:05,553
You survived the River of Sand.

436
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,955
Impressive.
And you, boy...

437
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:11,357
...so far from home.

438
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:16,262
I can ensure your safe return.
Just bring the weapon forward.

439
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,867
I don't think so.

440
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:20,367
Why do you want the staff?

441
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:23,666
When I deliver the lost weapon...

442
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:28,472
...the Jade Warlord shall grant me
the Elixir of Immortality.

443
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:32,749
An orphan girl,
a lost traveler...

444
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:34,350
...an old drunk...

445
01:02:34,485 --> 01:02:39,047
...and a monk who has failed at
the same task for half his life.

446
01:02:40,191 --> 01:02:45,652
Misfits following a misfit
in hopes of rescuing... a misfit.

447
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:08,044
Kill them.

448
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,565
Lu! Are you okay?

449
01:05:09,707 --> 01:05:11,470
Just thirsty.

450
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:36,366
It's okay.
He's immortal. Right?

451
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,558
I mean... He is, right?

452
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:39,462
Wine. He needs his wine!

453
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:40,863
There is nothing we can do.

454
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,665
What?!
We have to do something!

455
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:20,371
I'm afraid the wound is too deep.

456
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,773
He will not survive it.

457
01:06:23,478 --> 01:06:24,945
He needs wine.

458
01:06:25,981 --> 01:06:30,543
He's one of the Eight Immortals.
Wine is his elixir. Please.

459
01:06:31,987 --> 01:06:34,649
We will send a walking monk.

460
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:37,852
Don't you have a running monk?

461
01:06:59,581 --> 01:07:01,549
When I was your age...

462
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:05,247
...I was a scholar-warrior
in training.

463
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:09,546
My arrow was good.
So, too, my gongfu.

464
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:15,855
So I was chosen to
take the civil examinations.

465
01:07:16,598 --> 01:07:19,260
To pass would place me...

466
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:24,270
...in the very short line of
scholar immortals.

467
01:07:26,808 --> 01:07:28,469
I failed.

468
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:31,836
You're not an immortal?

469
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:40,449
If one does not attach himself
to people and desires...

470
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:45,159
...never shall his heart be broken.

471
01:07:46,895 --> 01:07:48,453
But then...

472
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:52,458
...does he ever truly live?

473
01:07:55,303 --> 01:07:58,067
I would rather die a mortal...

474
01:07:59,207 --> 01:08:01,869
...who has cared about someone...

475
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:07,448
...than a man free
from his own death.

476
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,452
I don't want to lose you.

477
01:08:14,089 --> 01:08:16,250
Forget about me.

478
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:21,958
<i>There is only one
Elixir of lmmortality.</i>

479
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:28,161
It is the Emperor's mix ofjade
cinnabar and salts of mercury.

480
01:08:28,303 --> 01:08:32,763
It is forever stored
in the realm of the Jade Palace...

481
01:08:33,308 --> 01:08:38,143
...high in the Jade Firmament,
rarely touched by mortals.

482
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:42,649
To reach it, one must take
the north road and cross the border...

483
01:08:42,784 --> 01:08:45,150
...of heaven and earth...

484
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:48,848
...only to face the Jade Army.

485
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,360
I'm sorry.

486
01:08:52,494 --> 01:08:55,156
There is no other way.

487
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,765
Yes, there is.

488
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,068
In two nights,
there will be no moon.

489
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,070
We can take the south side
of the fourth peak

490
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:06,470
under cover of darkness.

491
01:09:07,008 --> 01:09:08,373
- We have to go now.
- No!

492
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,744
He's going to die!

493
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:14,341
We go now, we all die.

494
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:22,246
There is more at stake...
an entire kingdom.

495
01:09:25,792 --> 01:09:27,851
Your passage home.

496
01:09:30,396 --> 01:09:34,457
We will advance in two nights,
when the moon has ceased.

497
01:09:34,601 --> 01:09:35,966
So be it!

498
01:10:22,882 --> 01:10:24,850
When she met you...

499
01:10:24,984 --> 01:10:29,045
...long ago in a tea house...

500
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:32,249
...you were a lost boy
and frightened.

501
01:10:34,894 --> 01:10:37,761
Not the kind she would stand
and fight with.

502
01:12:32,578 --> 01:12:36,036
You have made
a most excellent judgment.

503
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:55,567
The seeker from the prophecy.

504
01:12:56,202 --> 01:12:58,568
Not quite what I expected.

505
01:12:58,705 --> 01:13:01,970
A man is dying
back on Song Mountain.

506
01:13:02,807 --> 01:13:04,434
I need the Elixir.

507
01:13:05,076 --> 01:13:08,136
And why should I give it to you?

508
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:10,247
Because I brought you the staff.

509
01:13:10,881 --> 01:13:14,647
The life of your friend for
the power to rule a kingdom?

510
01:13:15,286 --> 01:13:17,846
A most reasonable offer.

511
01:13:18,389 --> 01:13:21,654
This man is a good friend?

512
01:13:22,193 --> 01:13:23,956
And a good teacher.

513
01:13:24,095 --> 01:13:27,861
The man who honors his teacher
honors himself.

514
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:30,162
However,

515
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:33,862
there is a bit of a problem
with your request.

516
01:13:34,004 --> 01:13:35,562
You see...

517
01:13:35,706 --> 01:13:39,733
...I've promised
the Elixir to someone else.

518
01:13:39,877 --> 01:13:43,040
But she didn't bring
you the staff. I did.

519
01:13:43,481 --> 01:13:45,642
The boy has a point.

520
01:13:48,285 --> 01:13:50,947
My Liege, you made a promise.

521
01:13:51,789 --> 01:13:55,657
There is but one way
to resolve such matters.

522
01:13:55,793 --> 01:13:59,456
A martial challenge...
to the death.

523
01:14:01,799 --> 01:14:03,357
With pleasure.

524
01:14:19,884 --> 01:14:22,546
The Elixir of Immortality.

525
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:30,156
The prize goes to the winner.

526
01:16:55,504 --> 01:16:56,630
Enough!

527
01:17:12,487 --> 01:17:15,047
The seeker from the prophecy.

528
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:17,852
I find that quite amusing.

529
01:17:18,594 --> 01:17:20,653
Did you really think,
even for a minute,

530
01:17:20,796 --> 01:17:22,661
you stood a chance?

531
01:17:25,601 --> 01:17:27,762
I didn't think so.

532
01:18:25,293 --> 01:18:27,454
She will kill you, witch!

533
01:18:27,596 --> 01:18:30,861
Not if I kill you first,
orphan bitch!

534
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:23,063
Ganbei!

535
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:43,949
Remember what I taught you!

536
01:22:41,681 --> 01:22:43,148
The statue!

537
01:22:47,687 --> 01:22:49,245
Use the staff!

538
01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:33,952
My turn!

539
01:26:17,695 --> 01:26:19,162
My Lord.

540
01:26:19,797 --> 01:26:21,059
Who are you?

541
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,634
The youngest daughter of
a family you murdered.

542
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:28,434
Come drink with me.

543
01:26:48,492 --> 01:26:50,050
No!

544
01:26:53,697 --> 01:26:56,165
Sparrow! Sparrow.

545
01:26:57,067 --> 01:26:59,729
Come on. Come on.

546
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:01,531
You're going to be okay.

547
01:28:32,694 --> 01:28:34,855
Jade Warlord...?

548
01:28:35,697 --> 01:28:37,130
He's dead.

549
01:28:44,072 --> 01:28:45,539
I...

550
01:28:48,277 --> 01:28:50,541
...I thank you.

551
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:46,430
Is there anything you can do?

552
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:52,238
Her destiny was written by
her own hand.

553
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:55,536
I am sorry.

554
01:30:29,478 --> 01:30:30,843
Traveler...

555
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,444
...you came far,
through the Gate of No Gate...

556
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:37,848
...to fulfill the prophecy
of the mortals.

557
01:30:38,186 --> 01:30:40,848
What do you desire, please?

558
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:44,155
I just want to go home.

559
01:30:46,094 --> 01:30:47,959
Very well.

560
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:55,832
It is said master and student...

561
01:30:55,971 --> 01:30:57,529
...walk the path side-by-side.

562
01:30:57,672 --> 01:31:01,438
They share their destiny
until their paths go separate ways.

563
01:31:08,283 --> 01:31:10,251
I'll never forget you.

564
01:31:10,385 --> 01:31:13,843
I guess that's what being
immortal truly means.

565
01:31:18,894 --> 01:31:20,953
You freed me, traveler.

566
01:31:22,097 --> 01:31:24,930
Now go free yourself.

567
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:12,932
So what's it going to be?

568
01:33:17,677 --> 01:33:19,235
You gonna shut up?

569
01:33:26,886 --> 01:33:30,253
Listen, pissant!
I ain't gonna ask you again!

570
01:33:43,069 --> 01:33:45,230
Come on, maggot, get up!

571
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:49,432
You want some more?
You want some more?

572
01:33:49,876 --> 01:33:51,434
Uh? Come on!

573
01:34:29,482 --> 01:34:31,040
We don't have to do this.

574
01:35:05,885 --> 01:35:08,445
Take it easy, sir.
You'll be fine.

575
01:35:08,588 --> 01:35:10,749
Hop!

576
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:14,449
- How is he?
- It missed his heart. He'll live.

577
01:35:15,893 --> 01:35:19,920
Of course I'll live.
I'm immortal.

578
01:35:22,066 --> 01:35:25,729
Did you return the staff
to rightful owner?

579
01:35:26,771 --> 01:35:28,136
I did.

580
01:35:29,173 --> 01:35:31,141
You're the man.

581
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:12,046
Will he be all right?

582
01:36:14,985 --> 01:36:16,350
Looks like it.

583
01:36:16,887 --> 01:36:20,345
I saw what happened.
I work across the street.

584
01:36:20,991 --> 01:36:22,652
You were very brave.

585
01:36:25,262 --> 01:36:27,127
See you.

586
01:36:30,267 --> 01:36:31,825
Absolutely.

587
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:48,442
<i>And so the legend is told...</i>

588
01:36:48,586 --> 01:36:51,350
<i>... that the Monkey King
began his journey west</i>

589
01:36:51,489 --> 01:36:53,457
<i>in search of truth...</i>

590
01:36:53,791 --> 01:36:56,259
<i>... while the traveler
returned to his world...</i>

591
01:36:56,393 --> 01:37:01,126
<i>... to walk the path of the warrior
and find his own truth.</i>

592
01:37:01,265 --> 01:37:03,733
<i>As one tale ends...</i>

593
01:37:03,868 --> 01:37:06,132
<i>... so another begins.</i>
