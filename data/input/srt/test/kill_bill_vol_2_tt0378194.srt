<i>(man) Do you find me sadistic?</i>

2
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,430
<i>You know, Kiddo...</i>

3
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:23,974
<i>...I'd like to believe...</i>

4
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,685
<i>...you're aware enough, even now...</i>

5
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:31,398
<i>...to know that there's nothing sadistic...</i>

6
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:33,359
<i>...in my actions.</i>

7
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:37,238
<i>At this moment...</i>

8
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:40,324
<i>...this is me...</i>

9
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:44,036
<i>...at my most masochistic.</i>

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,454
<i>Bill.</i>

11
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,082
<i>It's your ba...</i>

12
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:55,047
<i>(woman) Looked dead, didn't I?</i>

13
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:56,715
Well, l wasn't.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,386
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
l can tell you that.

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,597
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

16
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:06,976
a coma l was to lie in for four years.

17
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:12,064
When l woke up, l went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

18
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:15,693
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

19
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:18,821
l roared, and l rampaged,

20
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:21,573
and l got bloody satisfaction.

21
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:26,453
l've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

22
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,747
but l've only one more.

23
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:31,834
The last one.

24
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:34,503
The one l'm driving to right now.

25
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:38,299
The only one left.

26
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:42,011
And when l arrive at my destination,

27
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:45,472
l am gonna kill Bill.

28
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:48,559

29
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:14,084
<i>(woman) The incident that happened</i>

31
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,923

<i>"Massacre at Two Pines."</i>

33
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:24,803
<i>That's what the newspapers called it.</i>

34
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:26,555
<i>The local TV news called it,</i>

35
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,893
<i>"The El Paso, Texas</i>
<i>Wedding Chapel Massacre."</i>

36
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:33,687
<i>How it happened, who was there,</i>

37
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:36,565
<i>how many got killed</i>
<i>and who killed them -</i>

38

<i>changes depending on</i>
<i>who's telling the story.</i>

39
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:44,907
<i>In actual fact, the massacre didn't</i>
<i>happen during a wedding at all.</i>

40
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,160
<i>It was a wedding rehearsal.</i>

41
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:51,038
Now, when we come
to the part where l say,

42
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:54,666
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

43
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:57,711
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

44

<i>(laughter)</i>

45
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:01,924
This might be funny to your friends,

46
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:05,302
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

47
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:06,762
<i>(laughter continues)</i>

48
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:10,015
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

49
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:13,185
Y'all got a song?

50
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:19,858
How about "Love Me Tender"?
l can play that.

51
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:21,985
- Sure.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,405
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

53
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,615
Rufus - he's the man.

54
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:30,744
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

55
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,663
Rufus Thomas.

56
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:35,666
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,170
l was a Drell. l was a Drifter.
l was a Coaster.

58
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:43,799
l was part of the Gang.
l was a Barkay.

59
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:47,219
lf they come through Texas,
l done played with 'em.

60
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:52,057
Rufus - he's the man.

61
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:56,812
- Have l forgotten anything?
- Um...

62
00:03:56,896 --> 00:04:00,482
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

63
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,234
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

64
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,487
Now, the way we normally do this -

65
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:09,658
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

66
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:12,953
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

67
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:17,082
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

68
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,543
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

69
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,255
Right...

70
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,383
Well, l don't see no problem with...

71
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:29,761
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

72
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:32,681
- Do you, Mother?
- l don't have a problem with that.

73
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:33,765
But, uh...

74
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,187
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had somebody come.

75
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:41,356
You know, as a sign of good faith?

76
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,068
Well, l don't have anybody...

77
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:49,239
...except for Tommy and my friends.

78
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:53,535
- You have no family?
- Well, l'm workin' on changing that.

79
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,915
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little angel's ever gonna need.

80
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:03,712
l'm not feeling very well,
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

81
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:07,382
So while y'all blather on,
l'm gonna go outside and get some air.

82
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:10,552
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

83
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:14,056
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

84
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,975
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

85
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,435
(Reverend) Right...

Hello, Kiddo.

88

- How did you find me?
- l'm the man.

89
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,697
What are you doin' here?

90
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,908
What am l doin'?

91
00:06:58,411 --> 00:07:00,537
Well...

92
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:04,082
...moment ago l was playin' my flute.

93
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,090
At this moment...

94
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:17,679
...l'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride
these old eyes have ever seen.

95
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:23,101
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

96
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:29,775
- Are you gonna be nice?
- l've never been nice in my whole life.

97
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:34,780
But l'll do my best to be sweet.

98
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:35,864
Hmm.

99
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,368
l always told you...

100
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:42,829
...your sweet side is you best side.

101
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:47,793
l guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

102
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,091
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

103
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:58,845
- l'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

104
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:05,519
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

105
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:08,146
Have you seen Tommy?

106
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:13,485
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

107
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,612
Then l saw him.

108
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:19,032
l like his hair.

109
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,577
You promised you'd be nice.

110
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:29,209
No, l said l'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

111
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:31,545
But you're right.

112
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:35,090
What does your young man
do for a living?

113
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:39,428
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

114
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:44,057
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

115
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,394
Aren't we all?

116
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,193
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

117
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:59,614
l work in the record store.

118
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:02,159
Aso.

119
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:06,288
lt all suddenly seems so clear.

120
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,378
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. l like it a lot, smartass.

121
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:16,965
l get to listen to music all day...

122
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:20,677
...talk about music all day.
lt's really cool.

123
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:25,557
lt's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

124
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:32,981
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

125
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:35,776
and being paid vast sums of money?

126
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:39,446
Precisely.

127
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,365
Well, my old friend...

128
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,826
...to each his own.

129
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:49,456
However, all cockblockery aside...

130
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,001
l am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

131
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:58,465
l happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

132
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,721
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if l can sit on the bride's side.

133
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:08,934
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

134
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:12,437
Your side always was a bit lonely.

135
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:15,357
But l wouldn't sit anywhere else.

136
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:19,986
You know...

137
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:22,531
...l had the loveliest dream about you...

138
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,991
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

139
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,244
- You must be Tommy!
- Uh-huh.

140
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:29,538
Arlene's told me so much about you.

141
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:32,666
- Honey, you OK?
- Oh, l'm fine.

142
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,293
Tommy, l'd like you to meet my father.

143
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:38,547
Oh, my God!

144
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:40,757
Oh, my God, this is great!

145
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:43,426
l'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

146
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,762
The name's Bill.

147
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:47,681
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

148
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:51,393
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

149
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:54,688
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

150
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:58,191
Well, in the surprise department...

151
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:01,653
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

152
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:03,989
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

153
00:11:04,073 --> 00:11:07,075
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

154
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,620
Daddy, l told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

155
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:13,081
...no one could reach you.

156
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:16,585
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

157
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:18,628
So...

158
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:22,424
What's this all about?
l've heard of wedding rehearsals,

159
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:26,887
but l don't believe l've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

160
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:28,221
We thought,

161
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:31,558
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only going to wear once?"

162
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:34,561
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

163
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:38,189
So, l think we're going to try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

164
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:42,986
lsn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

165
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,197
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

166
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:50,619
Well, l guess l just believe
in living dangerously.

167
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:54,581
l knowjust what you mean.

168
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:57,918
(Reverend) Son.
Some of us have places to be.

169
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,502
(Rufus) Sure do.

170
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:03,965
Look, we got to go through this one
more time. So, why don't you have a s...

171
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,969
Oh, my God. What am l thinking?
You should give her away!

172
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:11,848
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

173
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:14,351
l think Father would be
much more comfortable

174
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:17,395
- sitting with the rest of the guests.
- Hmm. Really?

175
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,606
That's asking a lot.

176
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:23,944
Oh. OK.
Well, forget it.

177
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:26,988
But how about we go out
to dinner tonight to celebrate?

178
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:29,658
Only on the condition that
l pay for everything.

179
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:32,077
Deal. We got to do this now.

180
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:36,206
- Can l watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,584
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:16,366
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

They just call themselves

Anyhow, they all fell

- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

205
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,969
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

206
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:39,639
lt would appear he has broken it.

Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

to bring that out in people.

l know this is a ridiculous question
before l ask it,

Yep.

00:41:20,304 --> 00:41:23,473
...and demanded
of the temple's head abbot

478
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:29,062
that he offer Pai Mei his neck
to repay the insult.

479
00:41:30,314 --> 00:41:34,734
The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei.

480
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:37,821
Only to find Pai Mei was...

481
00:41:38,823 --> 00:41:40,532
...inconsolable.

482
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:43,618
<i>(♪ flute)</i>

483
00:41:51,836 --> 00:41:53,712
So began...

484
00:41:53,796 --> 00:42:00,051
...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple,
and all sixty of the monks inside,

485
00:42:00,136 --> 00:42:02,220
at the fists of the White Lotus.

486
00:42:03,848 --> 00:42:07,350
And... so began the legend...

487
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:12,105
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

488
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:14,399
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

489
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:17,110
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

490
00:42:17,194 --> 00:42:21,364
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

491
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:27,120
He hits you with his fingertips...

492
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:31,166
...at five different pressure
points on your body...

493
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,169
...and then lets you walk away.

494
00:42:35,337 --> 00:42:38,298
But once you've taken five steps...

495
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:42,385
...your heart explodes inside your body...

496
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,638
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

497
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:48,850
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

498
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:55,148
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

499
00:42:55,816 --> 00:42:57,859
Now...

500
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:01,613
...one of the things
l've always liked about you...

501
00:43:01,697 --> 00:43:03,198
...Kiddo...

502
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:07,786
...is you appear
wise beyond your years.

503
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:15,543
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

504
00:43:16,545 --> 00:43:18,004
Whatever...

505
00:43:18,088 --> 00:43:22,592
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

506
00:43:23,594 --> 00:43:28,723
lf you flash him, even for an instant,
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

507
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:34,020
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

508
00:43:34,104 --> 00:43:37,357
...he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

509
00:43:40,736 --> 00:43:43,613
And that will be the story of you.

510
00:43:46,242 --> 00:43:49,327
<i>(♪ flute)</i>

511
00:44:03,843 --> 00:44:06,386
He'll accept you as his student.

512
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,555
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

513
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:11,474
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

514
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,226
Why did he accept me?

515
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,605
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

516
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,899
And like all rotten bastards...

517
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:24,571
...when they become old,
they get lonely.

518
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,117
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

519
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:32,787
but it does teach them
the value of company.

520
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,624
Whew. Oh.

521
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:41,004
(sighs) Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

522
00:44:41,964 --> 00:44:43,464
You're gonna have a lot of fun

523

carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

524
00:44:52,016 --> 00:44:53,975
When will l see you again?

525
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:57,478
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the seventies.

526
00:44:57,563 --> 00:44:59,564
- What?
- Nothin'.

527
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:02,942
When he tells me you're done.

528
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:04,819
When do you think that might be?

529
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:07,822
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

530
00:45:07,907 --> 00:45:11,409
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

531
00:45:11,493 --> 00:45:13,828
At least not for the first year or so.

532
00:45:13,954 --> 00:45:17,165
You're gonna have to let him
warm up to you.

533
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:20,835
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

534
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,963
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

535
00:45:26,342 --> 00:45:29,719
So, in your case...
it might take a little while.

536

Mnh-mnh.

960
01:31:48,788 --> 01:31:51,289
- Come on, shy girl.
- Mnh-mnh.

961
01:31:51,374 --> 01:31:54,042
Come on. You know what you said.

962
01:31:54,127 --> 01:31:57,587
Come on. Tell Mommy.
lt'll make her feel good. Come on.

963
01:31:59,632 --> 01:32:01,216
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah. Come on.

964
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,427
l said... l said,

965
01:32:03,511 --> 01:32:09,641
"You're the most beautifulest woman
l ever saw in the whole wide world."

966
01:32:11,477 --> 01:32:15,272
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

967
01:32:15,356 --> 01:32:22,112
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

968
01:32:22,196 --> 01:32:27,367
- Yes, l do.
- Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

969
01:32:27,452 --> 01:32:32,205
- What's better than pretty?
- Mmm... Gorgeous.

970
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:38,170
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.

971
01:32:39,213 --> 01:32:44,968
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

972
01:32:45,052 --> 01:32:47,929
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

973
01:32:48,014 --> 01:32:51,349
l'm afraid l was.
l was a real bad daddy.

974
01:32:53,978 --> 01:32:58,273
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

975
01:32:58,357 --> 01:33:02,569
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

976
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:06,531
l killed him.

977
01:33:07,533 --> 01:33:11,995
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfish.

978
01:33:12,789 --> 01:33:17,292
She came running into my room,
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

979
01:33:17,376 --> 01:33:20,545
"Daddy. Daddy.
Emilio's dead."

980
01:33:22,215 --> 01:33:25,967
And l said, "Really? That's so sad.

981
01:33:26,052 --> 01:33:28,303
How did he die?"

982
01:33:28,387 --> 01:33:31,723
- And what did you say?
- l stepped on him.

983
01:33:31,808 --> 01:33:36,978
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

984
01:33:37,063 --> 01:33:39,815
"l accidentally stepped on him."

985
01:33:41,108 --> 01:33:42,901
To which l queried,

986
01:33:42,985 --> 01:33:48,532
"And just how did your foot accidentally
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

987
01:33:48,616 --> 01:33:52,953
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was
on the carpet when l stepped on him."

988
01:33:53,037 --> 01:33:56,248
Mmm. The plot thickens.

989
01:33:56,958 --> 01:34:01,837
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

990
01:34:01,921 --> 01:34:05,173
And, Mommy, you would've been
so proud of her.

991
01:34:07,635 --> 01:34:09,761
She didn't lie.

992
01:34:09,846 --> 01:34:14,015
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

993
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,518
...and put him on the carpet.

994
01:34:19,188 --> 01:34:22,315
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

995
01:34:23,317 --> 01:34:25,193
Flapping.

996
01:34:26,028 --> 01:34:30,198
- And then you stomped on him.
- Uh-huh.

997
01:34:30,283 --> 01:34:32,826
And when you lifted up your foot...

998
01:34:33,953 --> 01:34:37,914
- ...what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

999
01:34:37,999 --> 01:34:40,959
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

1000
01:34:43,296 --> 01:34:45,088
She told me later...

1001
01:34:45,882 --> 01:34:48,258
...that the second she lifted up her foot

1002
01:34:48,342 --> 01:34:52,554
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

1003
01:34:52,638 --> 01:34:57,684
ls that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

1004
01:34:57,768 --> 01:35:03,106
A fish flapping on the carpet,
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

1005
01:35:05,109 --> 01:35:10,822
So powerful, even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death...

1006
01:35:10,907 --> 01:35:12,699
...knew what it meant.

1007
01:35:13,951 --> 01:35:17,579
- You loved Emilio, didn't you?
- Uh-huh.

1008
01:35:17,663 --> 01:35:20,582
Well... l love Mommy too.

1009
01:35:22,126 --> 01:35:24,419
But l did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

1010
01:35:24,503 --> 01:35:28,340
- You stomped on Mommy?
- Worse.

1011
01:35:28,424 --> 01:35:30,467
l shot Mommy.

1012
01:35:30,551 --> 01:35:33,720
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

1013
01:35:33,804 --> 01:35:35,597
l shot her for real.

1014
01:35:35,681 --> 01:35:38,141
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

1015
01:35:38,225 --> 01:35:42,771
No, l knew what would happen
to Mommy if l shot her.

1016
01:35:42,855 --> 01:35:47,484
What l didn't know was, when l shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.

1017
01:35:47,568 --> 01:35:51,404
- What happened?
- l was very sad.

1018
01:35:53,491 --> 01:35:55,659
And that's when l learned...

1019
01:35:55,743 --> 01:36:01,039
...some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

1020
01:36:04,043 --> 01:36:09,214
- What happened to Mommy?
- Why don't you ask Mommy?

1021
01:36:09,298 --> 01:36:12,425
You OK, Mommy?
Does it hurt?

1022
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:14,427
No, sweetie.

1023
01:36:16,305 --> 01:36:18,306
Doesn't hurt anymore.

1024
01:36:24,397 --> 01:36:26,648
Did it make you sick?

1025
01:36:27,316 --> 01:36:31,820
No. lt made me sleep.

1026
01:36:31,904 --> 01:36:34,990
That's why l haven't been with you. B.B.
l've been asleep.

1027
01:36:35,074 --> 01:36:37,909
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

1028
01:36:38,577 --> 01:36:41,871
l'm wide awake, pretty girl.

1029
01:36:41,956 --> 01:36:47,210
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch
a video with you before sleepy time?

1030
01:36:47,294 --> 01:36:48,670
Uh-huh.

1031
01:36:48,754 --> 01:36:52,257
Mommy, do you want to watch
a video with me before sleepy time?

1032
01:36:52,341 --> 01:36:55,343
Oh, yeah!
l would love to.

1033
01:36:55,428 --> 01:36:58,138
- Which one do you wanna watch?
<i>- Shogun Assassin.</i>

1034
01:36:58,222 --> 01:37:00,640
No, B.B.
Shogun Assassin is too long.

1035
01:37:00,725 --> 01:37:04,811
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, it's not.

1036
01:37:04,895 --> 01:37:09,607
Well, then, l'll leave you ladies to it.

1041

01:40:18,505 --> 01:40:20,423
Quite a piece of work.

1068
01:40:21,759 --> 01:40:25,762
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

1069
01:40:25,846 --> 01:40:27,305
He's good.

1070

Has his sushi gotten any better?

1071
01:40:35,105 --> 01:40:40,193
You know, l couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

lt was easy.
l just dropped your name, Bill.

1073

<i>♪ Well, no one told me about her</i>

1075
01:41:17,982 --> 01:41:23,319
l suppose the idea is we cross
Hanzo swords. Am l right?

1076
01:41:25,364 --> 01:41:26,948
Well,

1077
01:41:27,032 --> 01:41:32,120
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

1078
01:41:32,204 --> 01:41:36,541
And that private beach just so happens
to look particularly beautiful

1079
01:41:36,625 --> 01:41:38,293
bathed in moonlight.

1080
01:41:39,628 --> 01:41:42,547
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.

1081
01:41:42,631 --> 01:41:49,220
So, swordfighter, if you want
a swordfight, that's where l suggest.

1082
01:41:49,305 --> 01:41:53,474
But if you wanna be old school about it...

1083
01:41:53,559 --> 01:41:57,228
...and you know
l'm all about old school...

1084
01:41:57,313 --> 01:42:00,982
...then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

1085
01:42:01,066 --> 01:42:03,234
like a couple of real-life honest...

1086
01:42:05,446 --> 01:42:10,700
Now, if you don't settle down, l'm gonna
have to put one in your kneecap.

1087
01:42:10,784 --> 01:42:14,037
And l hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

1088
01:42:16,123 --> 01:42:20,585
(laughing) l'm just fuckin' with you.

1089
01:42:21,587 --> 01:42:23,046
Now...

1090
01:42:23,797 --> 01:42:26,382
...when it comes to you...

1091
01:42:26,467 --> 01:42:28,134
...and us...

1092
01:42:30,095 --> 01:42:33,264
...l have a few unanswered questions.

1093
01:42:33,349 --> 01:42:38,895
So, before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax,

1094
01:42:39,897 --> 01:42:44,484
l'm gonna ask you some questions,
and l want you to tell me the truth.

1095
01:42:45,235 --> 01:42:48,237
However, therein lies a dilemma.

1096
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:52,075
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

1097
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:57,372
l believe you are truly and utterly
incapable of telling the truth.

1098
01:42:57,456 --> 01:43:02,001
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

1099
01:43:02,086 --> 01:43:05,421
And when it comes to the subject of me,

1100
01:43:05,506 --> 01:43:12,220
l am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

1101
01:43:12,304 --> 01:43:14,514
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

1102
01:43:14,598 --> 01:43:16,140
Well,

1103
01:43:16,225 --> 01:43:18,434
it just so happens,

1104
01:43:18,519 --> 01:43:20,561
l have a solution.

1105
01:43:20,646 --> 01:43:23,106
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

1106
01:43:23,190 --> 01:43:25,400
(grunting) Goddamn!

1107
01:43:25,484 --> 01:43:27,777
<i>(laughs)</i>

1108
01:43:27,861 --> 01:43:31,280
What the fuck
did you just shoot me with?

1109
01:43:31,365 --> 01:43:35,118
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

1110
01:43:35,786 --> 01:43:39,747
Don't touch it, or l'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

1111
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:49,715
What lies within that dart, just begging
to course its way through your veins...

1112
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:54,262
...is an incredibly potent
and quite infallible truth serum.

1113
01:43:54,346 --> 01:43:57,348
l call it "The Undisputed Truth."

1114
01:43:57,433 --> 01:44:01,978
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,
with no druggie aftereffects.

1115
01:44:03,021 --> 01:44:08,901
Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
You feel it?

1116
01:44:08,986 --> 01:44:11,529
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

1117
01:44:11,613 --> 01:44:14,991
- No.
- Too bad.

1118
01:44:16,118 --> 01:44:18,286
As you know...

1119
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:21,998
...l'm quite keen on comic books.

1120
01:44:22,666 --> 01:44:25,585
Especially the ones about superheroes.

1121
01:44:25,669 --> 01:44:31,299
l find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

1122
01:44:31,383 --> 01:44:35,011
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

1123
01:44:36,054 --> 01:44:39,140
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well drawn.

1124
01:44:40,726 --> 01:44:41,726
Mmm.

1125
01:44:42,519 --> 01:44:44,896
But the mythology...

1126
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:48,399
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.

1127
01:44:49,067 --> 01:44:52,695
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

1128
01:44:52,779 --> 01:44:56,657
About two minutes. Just long enough
for me to finish my point.

1129
01:44:56,742 --> 01:45:01,954
Now, a staple of the superhero
mythology is,

1130
01:45:02,039 --> 01:45:04,999
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

1131
01:45:05,083 --> 01:45:09,378
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

1132
01:45:10,422 --> 01:45:14,383
When that character wakes up
in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

1133
01:45:14,468 --> 01:45:18,971
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

1134
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:25,520
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

1135
01:45:25,604 --> 01:45:28,397
Superman didn't become Superman.

1136
01:45:28,482 --> 01:45:31,067
Superman was born Superman.

1137
01:45:31,151 --> 01:45:34,654
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

1138
01:45:35,656 --> 01:45:38,241
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

1139
01:45:39,117 --> 01:45:42,245
His outfit with the big red "S" -

1140
01:45:42,329 --> 01:45:46,040
that's the blanket he was wrapped in
as a baby when the Kents found him.

1141
01:45:46,124 --> 01:45:48,543
Those are his clothes.

1142
01:45:49,086 --> 01:45:54,340
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit - that's the costume.

1143
01:45:54,424 --> 01:45:58,928
That's the costume Superman wears
to blend in with us.

1144
01:46:00,597 --> 01:46:04,100
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

1145
01:46:04,184 --> 01:46:07,353
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

1146
01:46:07,437 --> 01:46:08,980
He's weak...

1147
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:12,733
...he's unsure of himself...

1148
01:46:12,818 --> 01:46:14,610
...he's a coward.

1149
01:46:15,612 --> 01:46:20,700
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

1150
01:46:22,452 --> 01:46:27,123
Sort of like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

1151
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:30,376
Aso.

1152
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:32,795
The point emerges.

1153
01:46:34,464 --> 01:46:37,967
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plimpton.

1154
01:46:38,051 --> 01:46:40,928
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1155
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:47,059
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1156
01:46:47,144 --> 01:46:49,145
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

1157
01:46:56,403 --> 01:46:58,738
Are you calling me a superhero?

1158
01:46:58,822 --> 01:47:00,323
l'm calling you a killer.

1159
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:03,909
A natural born killer.

1160
01:47:03,994 --> 01:47:07,663
You always have been,
and you always will be.

1161
01:47:07,748 --> 01:47:09,874
Moving to El Paso...

1162
01:47:09,958 --> 01:47:13,336
...working in a used record store...

1163
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:16,088
...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

1164
01:47:16,173 --> 01:47:17,632
...clipping coupons.

1165
01:47:17,716 --> 01:47:19,550
That's you...

1166
01:47:19,635 --> 01:47:23,054
...trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

1167
01:47:23,138 --> 01:47:26,182
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

1168
01:47:26,266 --> 01:47:28,392
But you're not a worker bee.

1169
01:47:29,645 --> 01:47:32,355
You're a renegade killer bee.

1170
01:47:32,439 --> 01:47:35,566
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate

1171
01:47:35,651 --> 01:47:38,694
or how fat your ass got,

1172
01:47:38,779 --> 01:47:42,698
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

1173
01:47:45,077 --> 01:47:46,869
First question:

1174
01:47:49,247 --> 01:47:53,918
Did you really think your life in El Paso
was gonna work?

1175
01:48:00,342 --> 01:48:02,051
No!

1176
01:48:05,597 --> 01:48:08,641
But l would've had B.B. !

1177
01:48:08,725 --> 01:48:11,310
Don't get me wrong.

1178
01:48:11,395 --> 01:48:15,314
l think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

1179
01:48:15,399 --> 01:48:17,483
But you are a killer.

1180
01:48:22,072 --> 01:48:24,740
All those people you killed to get to me...

1181
01:48:24,825 --> 01:48:27,410
...felt damn good, didn't they?

1182
01:48:29,496 --> 01:48:31,163
Yes.

1183
01:48:32,082 --> 01:48:34,500
Every single one of them?

1184
01:48:44,594 --> 01:48:46,429
Yes.

1185
01:48:49,766 --> 01:48:52,309
That was the warmup round.

1186
01:48:52,394 --> 01:48:57,064
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1187
01:49:04,406 --> 01:49:08,117
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

1188
01:49:11,955 --> 01:49:15,374
Do you remember the last assignment
you sent me on?

1189
01:49:15,459 --> 01:49:17,168
Of course.

1190
01:49:17,919 --> 01:49:19,962
Lisa Wong.

1191
01:49:21,214 --> 01:49:24,008
The morning l left, l was sick.

1192
01:49:25,552 --> 01:49:28,637
On the plane, l threw up.

1193
01:49:29,973 --> 01:49:32,475
So l started thinking:

1194
01:49:33,894 --> 01:49:36,103
Maybe l was pregnant.

1195
01:49:36,188 --> 01:49:41,525
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds.

1196
01:49:42,819 --> 01:49:45,321
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

1197
01:49:45,405 --> 01:49:48,866
You can read the results as soon as
the line appears in the window."

1198
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:50,034
<i>(sighs)</i>

1199
01:49:50,118 --> 01:49:52,119
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

1200
01:50:25,111 --> 01:50:26,111
Fuck.

1201
01:50:26,196 --> 01:50:28,405
<i>(the bride) What I didn't know...</i>

1202
01:50:28,490 --> 01:50:32,618
<i>...was that somewhere on my journey</i>
<i>I had been spotted.</i>

1203
01:50:32,702 --> 01:50:38,874
<i>With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong</i>
<i>long to send an assassin of her own.</i>

1204
01:50:40,043 --> 01:50:41,544
<i>- (doorbell)</i>
- (the bride) Hello, can l help you?

1205
01:50:41,628 --> 01:50:45,089
(woman) Hello, l'm Karen Kim.
l'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1206
01:50:45,173 --> 01:50:47,174
l have a welcome gift
from the management.

1207
01:50:47,259 --> 01:50:48,509
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1208
01:50:49,886 --> 01:50:51,554
Can you just leave it by the door?

1209
01:51:04,067 --> 01:51:07,945
- You pretty good with that shotgun?
- Not that l have to be at this range,

1210
01:51:08,029 --> 01:51:09,905
but l'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

1211
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:13,033
Well, guess what, bitch?
l'm better than Annie Oakley.

1212
01:51:13,118 --> 01:51:16,495
- And l got you right in my sight.
- l could blow your fuckin' head off.

1213
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:20,749
Not before l put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1214
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:24,253
Karen...

1215
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,883
...l just found out...

1216
01:51:28,967 --> 01:51:30,801
...right now...

1217
01:51:30,886 --> 01:51:35,139
...not a moment before
you blew a hole through the door...

1218
01:51:36,933 --> 01:51:41,186
- ...that l'm pregnant.
- What is this?

1219
01:51:41,271 --> 01:51:43,647
On the floor by the door...

1220
01:51:43,732 --> 01:51:47,401
...is a strip that says l'm pregnant.

1221
01:51:47,485 --> 01:51:48,652
Bullshit.

1222
01:51:49,779 --> 01:51:53,324
Any other time
you'd be 100 % right.

1223
01:51:53,408 --> 01:51:55,242
This time...

1224
01:51:56,828 --> 01:51:58,621
...you're 100 % wrong.

1225
01:52:00,665 --> 01:52:03,584
l'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1226
01:52:04,586 --> 01:52:06,712
But right now...

1227
01:52:06,796 --> 01:52:09,465
...l'm just scared shitless for my baby.

1228
01:52:10,258 --> 01:52:11,926
Please.

1229
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:15,846
Just look at the strip.

1230
01:52:17,849 --> 01:52:19,642
Please.

1231
01:52:20,936 --> 01:52:25,648
Stay where you are and don't move.

1232
01:52:42,832 --> 01:52:44,792
l don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

1233
01:52:44,876 --> 01:52:46,835
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

1234
01:52:59,349 --> 01:53:01,141
"Easy to use.

1235
01:53:01,226 --> 01:53:05,771
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

1236
01:53:05,855 --> 01:53:07,481
Blue means pregnant.

1237
01:53:07,565 --> 01:53:10,317
l'll read it myself, thank you.

1238
01:53:18,118 --> 01:53:19,827
Oh, OK.

1239
01:53:19,911 --> 01:53:21,787
Say l were to believe you.
What then?

1240
01:53:21,871 --> 01:53:23,914
Just go home.

1241
01:53:26,209 --> 01:53:28,377
l'll do the same.

1242
01:53:33,591 --> 01:53:35,175
<i>(door opens)</i>

1243
01:53:47,897 --> 01:53:49,565
Congratulations.

1244
01:53:53,153 --> 01:53:55,946
<i>(the bride) Before that strip turned blue...</i>

1245
01:53:56,031 --> 01:53:58,490
...l was a woman, l was your woman.

1246
01:53:59,492 --> 01:54:02,745
l was a killer who killed for you.

1247
01:54:02,829 --> 01:54:06,290
Before that strip turned blue,
l would've jumped a motorcycle

1248
01:54:06,374 --> 01:54:08,417
onto a speeding train.

1249
01:54:09,419 --> 01:54:11,170
For you.

1250
01:54:12,756 --> 01:54:16,175
But once that strip turned blue...

1251
01:54:16,259 --> 01:54:19,636
...l could no longer do
any of those things.

1252
01:54:19,721 --> 01:54:22,181
Not anymore.

1253
01:54:22,265 --> 01:54:24,641
Because l was gonna be a mother.

1254
01:54:27,854 --> 01:54:29,772
Can you understand that?

1255
01:54:32,859 --> 01:54:34,526
Yes.

1256
01:54:35,528 --> 01:54:37,738
But why didn't you...

1257
01:54:37,822 --> 01:54:40,115
...tell me then, instead of now?

1258
01:54:41,117 --> 01:54:43,410
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1259
01:54:43,495 --> 01:54:45,454
And l didn't want that.

1260
01:54:46,206 --> 01:54:48,415
Not your decision to make.

1261
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,542
Yes.

1262
01:54:50,627 --> 01:54:53,962
But it's the right decision,
and l made it for my daughter.

1263
01:54:54,964 --> 01:54:58,675
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1264
01:54:59,677 --> 01:55:01,678
But with you...

1265
01:55:01,763 --> 01:55:05,641
...she would've been born
into a world she shouldn't have.

1266

l had to choose.

1267
01:55:10,772 --> 01:55:12,773
l chose her.

1268
01:55:15,235 --> 01:55:18,028
You know, five years ago,

1269
01:55:18,113 --> 01:55:22,950
if l had to make a list of impossible
things that could never happen,

1270
01:55:23,034 --> 01:55:28,163
you performing a coup de grâce on me
by bustin' a cap in my crown...

1271
01:55:31,167 --> 01:55:33,794
...would've been right
at the top of the list.

1272
01:55:35,463 --> 01:55:37,548
l'd have been wrong, wouldn't l?

1273
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,634
l-l'm sorry.

1274
01:55:40,718 --> 01:55:42,803
Was that a question?

1275
01:55:44,139 --> 01:55:46,640
Of impossible things
that could never happen -

1276
01:55:46,724 --> 01:55:50,185
yes, in this instance
you would've been wrong.

1277
01:55:50,687 --> 01:55:52,104
Well?

1278
01:55:52,188 --> 01:55:55,732
When you never came back,

1279
01:55:55,817 --> 01:56:01,905
l naturally assumed Lisa Wong,
or somebody else, had killed you.

1280
01:56:01,990 --> 01:56:05,284
Oh! And for the record...

1281
01:56:05,368 --> 01:56:09,538
...letting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

1282
01:56:09,622 --> 01:56:11,498
is quite cruel.

1283
01:56:15,044 --> 01:56:18,964
l mourned you for three months.

1284
01:56:19,757 --> 01:56:23,051
And in the third month of mourning you...

1285
01:56:24,179 --> 01:56:26,471
...l tracked you down.

1286
01:56:26,556 --> 01:56:28,765
l wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1287
01:56:28,850 --> 01:56:33,187
l was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes l thought killed you.

1288
01:56:34,314 --> 01:56:36,190
So l find you...

1289
01:56:37,859 --> 01:56:40,110
...and what do l find?

1290
01:56:40,195 --> 01:56:43,447
Not only are you not dead...

1291
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:47,743
...you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

1292
01:56:49,829 --> 01:56:52,289
And you're pregnant.

1293
01:56:55,668 --> 01:56:58,212
l overreacted.

1294
01:57:06,804 --> 01:57:10,641
You overreacted?
ls that your explanation?

1295
01:57:10,725 --> 01:57:13,227
l didn't say l was gonna explain myself.

1296
01:57:13,311 --> 01:57:15,604
l said l was gonna tell you the truth.

1297
01:57:15,688 --> 01:57:20,484
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1298
01:57:22,487 --> 01:57:24,154
l'm a killer.

1299
01:57:25,156 --> 01:57:27,658
l'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

1300
01:57:28,576 --> 01:57:31,495
And there are consequences...

1301
01:57:31,579 --> 01:57:34,957
...to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

1302
01:57:35,959 --> 01:57:38,460
You experienced some of them.

1303
01:57:42,048 --> 01:57:45,717
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1304
01:57:45,802 --> 01:57:49,846
Yes. lt was.

1305
01:57:51,808 --> 01:57:55,560
Could you do what you did?

1306
01:57:55,645 --> 01:57:57,688
Of course you could.

1307
01:57:59,482 --> 01:58:05,988
But l never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

1308
01:58:06,072 --> 01:58:08,991
l'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1309
