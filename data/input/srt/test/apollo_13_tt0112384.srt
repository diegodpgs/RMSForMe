1
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,076
<i>The crew's crossing gantry
for capsule ingress.</i>

2
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:48,571
<i>Roger that.</i>

3
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,415
<i>Inspired by
the late President Kennedy...</i>

4
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:56,422
<i>in only seven years, America has risen
to the challenge of what he called:</i>

5
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,283
<i>"The most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure..."</i>

6
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,861
<i>"on which man has ever embarked."</i>

7
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,533
<i>After trailing the Russians for years
with our manned space program...</i>

8
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,536
<i>and after that sudden and horrible fire...</i>

9
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,004
<i>on the launch pad during a routine test...</i>

10
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,872
<i>that killed
American astronauts Gus Grissom...</i>

11
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,275
<i>Ed White and Roger Chaffee...</i>

12
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:22,007
<i>there were serious doubts that
we could beat the Russians to the moon.</i>

13
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,109
<i>But tonight, a mere 18 months
after the tragedy of</i> Apollo 1...

14
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,247
<i>the entire world watched in awe
as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...</i>

15
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,915
<i>landed on the moon.</i>

16
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,551
<i>The big news came just a moment ago.</i>

17
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,597
<i>Mission Control gave
the spacecraft permission...</i>

18
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,530
<i>to go for the extravehicular activity...</i>

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,534
<i>that is, for the walk on the moon...</i>

20
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:47,267
<i>far earlier than anticipated,
9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time...</i>

21
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,376
The important thing when you penetrate
the lunar module is your attitude...

22
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,910
and relative speed.

23
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,538
Let's say this is me here
in the command module and this is you...

24
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,209
- All right.
- ...in the LEM.

25
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,446
This thing sticking out here
is called the probe.

26
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,522
- Is that true?
- Absolutely.

27
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:07,188
Tracey, when you feel that thing slide in,
everything's clicking...

28
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,119
it's like no other feeling in the world.

29
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,158
- A little liquid propulsion.
- What's the big occasion?

30
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,225
How's it going at Mission Control?

31
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,032
It's a nervous time.
They're pacing around and smoking.

32
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,539
Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies.
Jim Lovell.

33
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,832
This is Tracey.

34
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,809
- How do you do, Tracey?
- This is the man.

35
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,336
<i>Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8.</i>
They were the first around the moon.

36
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,905
This guy did 10 laps.

37
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,045
With one hand on the wheel.
Make yourselves at home.

38
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,247
This is the last champagne
in the city of Houston.

39
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,382
- Very good.
- Everything else all right?

40
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,086
- Everything's on course.
- Looks okay. Cadet Lovell.

41
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,994
- Hey, Dad.
- Put this on ice. Make sure it gets cold.

42
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:48,091
- You gonna get a haircut this week?
- I'm on vacation.

43
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,826
Get a haircut.

44
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,439
- I wouldn't mind being up there tonight.
- God, who wouldn't.

45
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,915
Don't worry. Our day's coming.

46
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,645
They're not gonna cut the program
before number 14.

47
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,118
You know, my cousin called.

48
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,352
Asked who we bribed
to get on Jim Lovell's crew.

49
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,920
I told him they wanted
to make sure he got the best.

50
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,123
Well, they got that right.

51
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,634
What network do we want?

52
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,461
Put on Walter!

53
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,029
Jules Bergman!

54
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,539
John, turn it up!

55
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:35,906
I really appreciate...

56
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:40,112
you all coming to this dress rehearsal party
for my <i>Apollo 12</i> landing.

57
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,813
Sit down, Conrad.

58
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,823
I think we should all take
a moment to recognize...

59
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,620
the exemplary...

60
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,662
hell, damn near heroic effort...

61
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:54,028
displayed by Neil Armstrong's backup
for this historic moon walk...

62
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,499
and, of course, his crew.

63
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,970
Let's hear it for Jim Lovell,
Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.

64
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,239
There he is! Everybody quiet down!

65
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,044
Hey! Kids!

66
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,846
<i>You got a good picture, huh?</i>

67
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:18,046
<i>We can verify the position of the opening
I ought to have on the camera.</i>

68
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,928
- You think it's too late for him to abort?
- He still has time to get out.

69
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,763
- He just needs somebody to wave him off.
- Pull up, Neil!

70
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,132
Pull up!

71
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,071
<i>Neil, we can see you
coming down the ladder now.</i>

72
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,133
<i>Look at those pictures.</i>

73
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,010
<i>I'm at the foot of the ladder.</i>

74
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:45,581
<i>The LEM footpads
are only depressed in the surface about...</i>

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,046
<i>one or two inches.</i>

76
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,680
<i>It's almost like a powder.</i>

77
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,656
<i>Armstrong is on the moon.</i>

78
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,194
<i>Neil Armstrong, 38-year-old American...</i>

79
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,326
<i>standing on the surface of the moon...</i>

80
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,828
<i>on this July 20, 1969.</i>

81
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,303
<i>That's one small step
for man...</i>

82
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,302
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

83
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,235
<i>His quote was:</i>

84
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,674
<i>"That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind."</i>

85
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,524
You're drunk, Lovell.

86
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,761
I'm not used to the champagne.

87
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,470
Me, neither.

88
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,839
I can't deal with cleaning up.
Let's sell the house.

89
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,313
All right, let's sell the house.

90
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,682
They're back inside now looking up at us.

91
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,384
Isn't that something?

92
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,953
I bet Jannie Armstrong
doesn't get a wink of sleep tonight.

93
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,557
When you were on the far side on <i>8,</i>
I didn't sleep at all.

94
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,258
I just vacuumed over and over again.

95
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,564
Christopher Columbus,
Charles Lindbergh, and Neil Armstrong.

96
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,298
Neil Armstrong.

97
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,916
From now on, we live in a world
where man has walked on the moon.

98
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,256
It's not a miracle.

99
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,829
We just decided to go.

100
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,293
On <i>Apollo 8,</i> we were so close...

101
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,460
just 60 nautical miles down and...

102
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,969
It was as if I could just...

103
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,472
step out and walk on the face of it.

104
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,245
I want to go back there.

105
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,759
Where's my mountain?

106
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,329
It's right up by the...

107
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,999
Do you see where the shadow crosses...

108
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,537
the white area there?
That's the Sea of Tranquillity...

109
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,903
and your mountain's on the edge of that.

110
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,776
It's your mountain, Marilyn. Mount Marilyn.

111
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,407
I don't see it.

112
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,416
Well, you gotta look harder.

113
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,355
You look harder...

114
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,925
while I...

115
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:59,040
<i>The astronaut is the most
visible member of a very large team.</i>

116
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,313
<i>All of us,
down to the guy sweeping the floor...</i>

117
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,111
<i>are honored to be a part of it.</i>

118
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,981
<i>What did the man say? "Give me a lever
long enough and I'll move the world"?</i>

119
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,820
<i>That's what we're doing here.
This is divine inspiration, folks.</i>

120
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,794
<i>It's the best part of each one of us,
the belief that anything is possible.</i>

121
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:20,164
Things like a computer
that can fit into a single room...

122
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,659
and hold millions of pieces of information...

123
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,997
or the Saturn 5 rocket.

124
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,632
This is the actual launch vehicle
that will be taking Alan Shepard...

125
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,668
and his crew on the first leg
of the <i>Apollo 13</i> mission.

126
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,471
When are you going up again, Jim?

127
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:41,210
I'm slated to be the commander
of <i>Apollo 14</i> sometime late next year.

128
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,247
If there is an <i>Apollo 14.</i>

129
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,158
People in my state have been asking
why we're continuing...

130
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,927
to fund this program now that we've
beaten the Russians to the moon.

131
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,367
Imagine if Christopher Columbus
had come back from the New World...

132
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,428
and no one returned in his footsteps.

133
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,474
<i>Attention, all personnel.
Clear level 3.</i>

134
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,303
Are there any other questions?

135
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,972
How do you go to the bathroom in space?

136
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,608
It's a highly technical process...

137
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,986
of cranking down the window
and looking for a gas station which...

138
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,656
There's Deke Slayton.

139
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,325
You might be able to answer
this lady's question.

140
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,161
Deke is one of the original
<i>Mercury 7</i> astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.

141
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,793
Now he's our boss. He hands out
the astronauts' flight assignments...

142
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,931
so naturally we kick back
part of our salaries to Deke.

143
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,032
- How much this month?
- Can I have a minute? Something's come up.

144
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,700
Sure.

145
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:50,047
- Anybody home?
- I'm not being a cheerleader, Mom!

146
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,022
You don't understand! I worked so hard!

147
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,888
Maybe I don't understand...

148
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,655
but you are not wearing that
out in this neighborhood.

149
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,357
She's not even wearing a bra!
You can see everything!

150
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,728
Shut up!

151
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,563
Hey, everybody. Marilyn, trick or treat.

152
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,639
You know that Easter vacation trip
we had planned for Acapulco?

153
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,975
I was thinking there might be
a slight change in destination.

154
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,541
Really?

155
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,046
Maybe, say...

156
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:17,941
the moon.

157
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,948
Al Shepard's ear infection has flared up...

158
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:27,059
and we've all been bumped up
to the prime crew of <i>Apollo 13.</i>

159
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,891
Straight to the head of the line
and the Fra Mauro Highlands.

160
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,331
Six months? You're moving up six months?

161
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,333
Dad, can I please wear this?

162
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,661
Sure.

163
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,830
No! Absolutely not.

164
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,743
They're not rushing things, are they?
You'll be ready in six months?

165
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,749
We'll be ready. I wouldn't want
to be around Al Shepard tonight.

166
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,810
I gotta get over there
and get up to speed on this.

167
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,312
Go.

168
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,186
I'm gonna walk on the moon, Marilyn.

169
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,588
I know. I can't believe it.

170
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,220
Naturally, it's 13. Why 13?

171
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,658
It comes after 12, hon.

172
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,729
Apollo 13, <i>you are go
for pyro arm and docking.</i>

173
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,575
<i>All systems are nominal and on the line.</i>

174
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:23,076
<i>S-4B is stable,
SLA panels are drifting free.</i>

175
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,118
<i>The drogue is clear.
The docking target is clear.</i>

176
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,890
<i>I'm coming up on that now.
Two, one, mark.</i>

177
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,058
Seventy-five feet.
We're coming up on docking.

178
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:39,121
Let's shut down some thrusters on them.
Let's see what he does.

179
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,424
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,932
I lost something here. I can't translate up.

181
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,870
Houston, we are drifting down and away.

182
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,042
- Wanna back off and take another run?
- No, I got it.

183
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,909
Let me just try and get it stable here.

184
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,748
- I'm gonna reset the high gain.
- I've got the target back in the reticle.

185
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,184
Okay, we're stable. Recycle the valves.

186
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,619
- Forty feet.
- They're all gray.

187
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,522
Twenty.

188
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,162
Ten feet.

189
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,168
- Capture.
- That's it!

190
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,363
- That's it.
- Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful.

191
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,877
- Gentlemen, that is the way we do that.
- Man, that woke me up.

192
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:30,139
Apollo 13 <i>backup crew,
you're up in the simulator.</i>

193
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,151
- Nice job, gentlemen.
- That's three hours of boredom...

194
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,381
followed by seven seconds of sheer terror.

195
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,922
Good job, guys.
You just won the Christmas turkey.

196
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,659
Nice try, Frank.

197
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,730
You really outfoxed them.

198
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,561
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect.
Used up too much fuel.

199
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,191
You're above the curve.

200
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,568
Not by much.
Listen, guys, I wanna work it again.

201
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,505
We gotta be up with the dawn patrol
headed for Bethpage at 0700.

202
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,409
- Wheels up at 0700.
- Yeah, I know...

203
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,175
but my rate of turn is still a little slow there.

204
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,944
I really think we should work it again.

205
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,420
- Let's get it right.
- Set it up again, Frank.

206
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,959
<i>Okay,</i> 13 <i>backup crew.
It'll have to wait.</i>

207
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,518
<i>Prime crew's up for another run.</i>

208
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,599
Apollo 13,
<i>we show S-4B shutdown...</i>

209
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,635
<i>and all systems are nominal.</i>

210
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,864
<i>Fred, set the S-band omni to B...</i>

211
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,702
<i>and when you get in the LEM, to forward.</i>

212
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,840
<i>Good shape over here.</i>

213
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,670
Hey, we got a problem.

214
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,349
Cabin depress. Repeat, cabin depress.

215
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,782
- Ken, get your helmet on!
- I can't get it locked!

216
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,380
Houston, something ripped
a big hole in us! We got rapid depress!

217
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,054
Oh, God!

218
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,590
I thought the stars would fall on you.

219
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,554
That's silly. Stars can't fall on us.

220
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,896
You're a smarter kid than I was.

221
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,633
How long will it take you
to get to the moon?

222
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,928
Four days.

223
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,368
But that's pretty fast.

224
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,668
See, this is the Saturn 4B booster...

225
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,369
and it shoots us away from the Earth...

226
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,503
as fast as a bullet from a gun...

227
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,477
until the moon's gravity
actually grabs us and pulls us...

228
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,048
into a circle around the moon...

229
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,718
which is called an orbit. All right?

230
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,797
Fred and I float down the tunnel
into the lunar module...

231
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,826
this spidery-looking guy.

232
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,859
Only holds two people,
and it's just for landing on the moon.

233
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,872
And I take the controls, steer it around...

234
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,931
and I fly it down...

235
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,602
adjusting it here, the attitude there,
pitch, roll...

236
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:17,578
for a nice, soft landing on the moon.

237
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,352
Better than Neil Armstrong.
Way better than Pete Conrad.

238
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,760
Did you know the astronauts in the fire?

239
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,828
Yeah. I knew the astronauts in the fire.
All of them.

240
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,830
Could that happen again?

241
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,111
Well, I'll tell you something about that fire.

242
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,340
A lot of things went wrong.

243
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,642
The door.

244
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,717
It's called the hatch. They couldn't
get it open when they needed to get out.

245
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,655
That was one thing.

246
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,728
A lot of things went wrong in that fire.

247
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,067
Did they fix it?

248
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,260
Yes, absolutely. We fixed it.

249
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,900
It's not a problem anymore.

250
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,610
I can't believe they still have you
doing public appearances.

251
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,988
Well, Henry Hurt was all over me.

252
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,851
With a training schedule this tight,
they shouldn't be asking.

253
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,329
It's the program, Marilyn.
You know, it's NASA.

254
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,957
Hey, you're Jim Lovell, aren't you?

255
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,493
Hey! Lucky <i>13!</i>

256
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,368
Right on!

257
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,147
That's the second time it's done that.

258
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,917
I was looking
at the kids' school schedule coming up.

259
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,262
It's a very busy week.

260
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:17,198
I'm thinking about not going to the launch.

261
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,074
The kids need me at home.

262
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,773
Marilyn, we've had these kids
for a while now.

263
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,483
They've never kept you
from coming to the other launches.

264
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,917
But your mother just had this stroke.

265
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,284
Mom's fine.

266
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,789
It's not like I've never been to a launch.

267
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,291
The other wives have not done three.

268
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,889
I just don't think I can go through all that.

269
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,234
I'll just be glad when this one's over.

270
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,602
You're gonna miss a hell of a show.

271
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,645
Hey, guys. See you in a few weeks.

272
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:11,417
Take care. Bring us back a moon rock.

273
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,150
- The number 13 doesn't bother you?
- Only if it's a Friday.

274
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,914
<i>Apollo 13,</i> lifting off
at 1300 hours and 13 minutes...

275
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:50,018
and entering the moon's gravity on April 13?

276
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,122
Ken Mattingly here has been doing
some scientific experiments...

277
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,224
regarding that very phenomenon.

278
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,467
Yes, well, I had a black cat...

279
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,471
walk over a broken mirror...

280
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,976
under the lunar module ladder.
It didn't seem to be a problem.

281
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,012
We're considering a letter we got...

282
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,309
which said we ought to take a pig with us
for good luck.

283
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,816
Does it bother you that the public
regards this flight as routine?

284
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,823
There's nothing routine about flying
to the moon. I can vouch for that.

285
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,857
I think that an astronaut's last mission...

286
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,626
his final flight is always very special.

287
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,229
Why is this your last, Jim?

288
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,807
I'm in command of the best ship...

289
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,866
with the best crew
that anybody could ask for...

290
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,669
and I'll be walking in a place
where there's 400 degrees difference...

291
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,011
between sunlight and shadow.

292
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,217
I can't imagine ever topping that.

293
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,352
We have that scheduled
for 0900 hours tomorrow.

294
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,420
- That's not gonna work, Walter.
- Why?

295
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,557
Freddo and I are going over
the lunar surface experiments tomorrow...

296
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:07,868
and Ken's gonna be back in the simulator.
We're going over the flight plan tonight.

297
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,706
Gonna pay a visit to this machine
after you're hard down.

298
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,279
Jim, we've got a problem.

299
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,939
We just got some blood work
back from the lab.

300
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,712
Charlie Duke has the measles.

301
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,244
So we need a new backup.

302
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,090
- You've all been exposed to it.
- I've had the measles.

303
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,058
Ken Mattingly hasn't.

304
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,991
You wanna break up my crew
two days before the launch...

305
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:37,428
when we can predict each other's moves,
read the tone of each other's voices?

306
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,972
Ken Mattingly
will get seriously ill...

307
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,007
precisely when you and Haise will be
ascending from the lunar surface.

308
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,839
That's a lousy time for a fever.

309
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,846
Jack Swigert has been out
of the loop for weeks.

310
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,142
He's fully qualified to fly this mission.

311
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,084
He's a fine pilot, but when was the last time
he was in a simulator?

312
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,251
I'm sorry, Jim. I understand how you feel.

313
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,258
We can do one of two things.

314
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,226
We can either scrub Mattingly
and go with Swigert...

315
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,560
or we can bump all three of you
to a later mission.

316
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,037
I've trained for the Fra Mauro Highlands...

317
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,210
and this is flight surgeon horseshit, Deke!

318
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,978
Jim, if you hold out for Ken,
you will not be on <i>Apollo 13.</i>

319
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,947
It's your decision.

320
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,082
Let it ring.

321
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,284
Listen, I gotta take that.

322
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,054
- Why?
- Because I'm on the backup crew...

323
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,928
and the backup crew has to set up
the guest list and book the hotel rooms.

324
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,271
Yes, sir.

325
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,103
I understand.

326
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,569
Thank you, sir.

327
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,835
Damn.

328
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,072
Medical guys.

329
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:37,252
I had a feeling when they started doing
all the blood tests that...

330
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,892
I mean, I know it's their ass
if I get sick up there, but, I mean... Jesus!

331
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,705
Swigert, he'll be fine.

332
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,987
He's strong.

333
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,523
It'll be a hell of a mission.
One for the books.

334
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:23,259
You sure about this?
Why don't I talk to Deke?

335
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,667
I'm sure we can work this out.

336
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,201
This was my call.

337
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,012
Must've been a tough one.

338
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,025
Look, I don't have the measles.

339
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,594
I'm not gonna get the measles.

340
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,694
Ken, wait up.

341
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,638
Trajectory is holding steady.
We're right on the line.

342
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:12,045
We're into program 64 at .05 G...

343
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,676
so we're feeling that gravity now.

344
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,517
Houston, we are at 400,000 feet
passing entry interface.

345
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,722
<i>About to lose signal.</i>

346
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,350
<i>Re-entry data is nominal,
and we have radio blackout.</i>

347
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,864
What's the story here?

348
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,028
I got a corridor light.
We're coming in too shallow.

349
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,138
I'm going to manual.

350
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,478
- Houston, switching to SCS.
<i>- Roger,</i> 13.

351
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,574
Okay, we're at three Gs.

352
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,548
Five Gs.

353
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,420
We're coming in too steep.

354
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,754
I'm gonna stay in this roll
and see if I can pull us out.

355
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,756
We're at eight Gs.

356
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,823
Nine.

357
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,522
Ten.

358
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,770
- We're at 12 Gs.
- 12 Gs. We're burning up.

359
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,765
Damn it!

360
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,971
I gave them a false indicator light
at entry interface.

361
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,171
Even Mattingly didn't get it the first time.

362
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,270
How are you feeling, Freddo?

363
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,305
Charbroiled.

364
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,387
What happened?

365
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,788
Came in too steep. We're dead.

366
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,956
No shit.

367
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,053
We were into program 67 there.

368
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,401
We're gonna do this again, obviously.

369
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,063
<i>Give us a minute to get our switches reset.</i>

370
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,197
Jim, could we have a word?

371
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,311
Sure, Deke.

372
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,347
<i>We're going to drop offline
and debrief this one on our own.</i>

373
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,661
If I had a dollar every time
they killed me in this thing...

374
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,596
I wouldn't have to work for you, Deke.

375
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:15,602
Well, we have two days. We'll be ready.

376
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,604
Let's do it again.

377
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,844
Do it again.

378
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,757
Get down, Fred! Stephen, come here!

379
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,023
We can't go across that road.

380
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:42,161
We don't want Daddy to get our germs
and get sick in outer space.

381
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,997
Hey, boys. Not giving your mom
a hard time, are you?

382
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,270
Princess, you look beautiful.

383
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,861
That looks like Marilyn Lovell.

384
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,594
But it can't be.
She's not coming to the launch.

385
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,897
I heard it was gonna be a hell of a show.

386
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,471
Who told you that?

387
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,233
Some guy I know.

388
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,946
You can't live without me.

389
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,343
Okay, folks. Let's say goodnight.

390
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,247
We got a big day tomorrow for these guys.

391
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,150
Goodnight!

392
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,085
You hear about Ken?

393
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,749
Yeah.

394
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,840
Stand back, please.

395
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,673
Guenter Wendt!

396
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,514
I wonder where Guenter went?

397
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,382
- You walk on the moon, <i>ja?
- Ja,</i> we walk...

398
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,751
and we talk on the moon.

399
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,901
How do you feel?
Pretty good?

400
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,937
Might be a little warmer in here.

401
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,374
- How are you today?
- Good.

402
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,810
- Ready?
- Yeah.

403
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,735
God, no.

404
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,753
Okay, we have
the oxygen purge system.

405
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,844
Check.

406
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,321
We have
the helmet restraint ring.

407
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,880
Check.

408
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,097
Communication umbilical on.

409
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,031
- Fred.
- What?

410
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,574
- Gum.
- Sorry.

411
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,673
Thanks.

412
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,413
I'm gonna give these guys a beautiful ride.

413
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,041
I'm sure you will, Jack.

414
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,696
You need more air?

415
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,617
You want some apple?

416
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,386
I hate this already.

417
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,425
You're not just about to pop, are you?

418
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,224
No. I got 30 days till this blasts off.

419
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,608
This is for Gene.

420
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,710
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out
the needle and thread again.

421
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,114
The last one looked
like he bought it off a gypsy.

422
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,379
Well, you can't argue with tradition.

423
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,818
Copy that.

424
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,122
This is from your wife, Gene.

425
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,183
Thank you, Tom.

426
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,786
I was starting to get worried.

427
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,430
There we go.

428
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,231
- I like that one, Gene.
- Sharp, Gene.

429
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,014
Jim, you're all set.

430
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,855
Very sharp.

431
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,026
Gene,
I guess we can go now.

432
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,497

we have cleared the tower at 13:13.</i>

470
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,700
Okay, guys, we got it.

471
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,773
Come on, baby.

472
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,746
Altitude is on the line.

473
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,788
Velocity right on the line.

474
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,354
Roll complete. We are pitching.

475
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,399
13, <i>stand by for Mode One Bravo.</i>

476
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,571
FIDO, how we looking?

477
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,438
Looks good, Flight. Right down the middle.

478
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,346
<i>We see your BPC is clear,</i> 13.

479
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,748
Roger. EDS to manual.

480
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,581
Inboard.

481
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,581
Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.

482
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,265
That was some little jolt.

483
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,111
Tower jett.

484
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,785
Houston, we've got a center engine cut-off.
Go on the other four.

485
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,855
Roger that, <i>13.</i>
We show the same.

486
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,160
Booster, can you confirm that cut-off?

487
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,671
- Roger. Looks like we lost it.
- FIDO, what'll that do to us?

488
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,166
Stand by, Flight.

489
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,673
I need to know if the IUs are correcting
for the number five shutdown.

490
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,052
Houston, what's the story on engine five?

491
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:43,517
We're still go. We'll be all right
as long as we don't lose another one.

492
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,157
- Roger that.
- We're not sure why the inboard was out...

493
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,724
but the other engines are go,
so we're gonna burn those engines...

494
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,667
a little bit longer.

495
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,205
Roger that. Our gimbals are good.

496
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,535
Our trim is good.

497
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,448
Looks like we just had our glitch
for this mission.

498
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:16,491
- 13, <i>stand by for staging.</i>
- Roger that.

499
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:20,358
<i>S-2 shutdown. S-4B ignition.</i>

500
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,192
<i>Thrust looks good, Flight.</i>

501
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,964
Flight, S-4B cut-off in 10 seconds.

502
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:31,373
<i>13,</i> this is Houston.
Predicted cut-off is 12 plus 34, over.

503
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,678
Coming up on 12 minutes, 34.

504
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,540
And...

505
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,109
SECO!

506
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,881
<i>Shutdown.</i>

507
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,319
<i>And that, gentlemen, is how we do that.</i>

508
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,411
Oh, boy. Hope I can sleep.

509
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,284
Mom, that was loud.

510
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,453
Here, hold my hand.

511
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,086
I can't believe you did this four times.

512
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,594
The worst part's over.

513
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:25,891
It is?

514
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:31,669
Listen, this doesn't stop for me
until he lands on that aircraft carrier.

515
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,937
Well, you just look so calm about it.

516
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:38,135
If the flight surgeon had to okay me
for this mission, I'd be grounded.

517
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:41,007
- Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise!
- Can we speak to you?

518
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,744
Can we just have a word with you, please?

519
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:47,080
Remember, you're proud,
happy, and thrilled.

520
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,343
- How're you feeling?
- Very proud...

521
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,650
and very happy, and we're thrilled.

522
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,258
<i>Flight, Booster. I show S-4B shutdown.</i>

523
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,466
TLI is on the money. Looks good, Flight.

524
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,033
Roger, FIDO.

525
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,467
We're going to the moon!

526
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,009
Flight, we have reacquisition
of signal at Hawaii.

527
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,100
Flight, everything looks good.

528
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,547
Okay, Houston. CMP here.

529
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,947
I've exchanged couches with Jim.
I'm in the pilot's seat.

530
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,285
I'm gonna go ahead and get set
for transposition and docking.

531
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,452
<i>Roger that, Jack.</i>

532
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,166
Freddo, you okay?

533
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,339
<i>Everybody, let's get turned around
and pick up the lunar module.</i>

534
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,076
Odyssey, you're go
for pyro arm and docking...

535
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,852
and we recommend you secure
cabin pressurization.

536
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,087
<i>Roger that.</i>

537
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,957
Okay, we're ready for CSM separation.

538
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,559
Okay, SMRCS isol valves are all gray.

539
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,462
Okay, Swigert, command module pilot.

540
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,496
She's all yours.

541
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,640
<i>Houston, we've got a good separation.</i>

542
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:22,474
<i>- The S-4B is stable.
- Translation looks good.</i>

543
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,912
<i>- Reconfirm then,</i> 13.
<i>- We're gonna start to pitch around...</i>

544
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,917
<i>to line up with the LEM.</i>

545
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,076
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman...

546
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,183
was upchucking most of the way
to the moon on <i>Apollo 8.</i>

547
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,352
I'm all right. I just ate too much breakfast.
Let's go to work.

548
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,424
And pitching up.

549
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,657
Pitch rate, 2.5 degrees per second.

550
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,693
<i>Roger, Jack.</i>

551
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,794
We see you pitching around.

552
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,531
Keep an eye on that telemetry.

553
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,009
Roger that. If Swigert can't
dock this thing, we don't have a mission.

554
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,173
- How's the alignment?
- GDC align.

555
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:05,184
Thrusting forward.

556
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,786
<i>One hundred feet.</i>

557
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,058
Watch the alignment now.

558
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,968
Don't worry, guys.

559
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,772
I'm on top of it.

560
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,142
<i>FIDO, let me know
when you're ready.</i>

561
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,651
<i>Let's uplink that.</i>

562
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,413
- How we looking?
- We're not there yet. Forty feet.

563
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,788
<i>Twenty.</i>

564
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,959
Come on, rookie, park that thing.

565
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,672
Ten feet.

566
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,582
Capture.

567
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,352
That's it.

568
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,722
- Talk back is barber pole.
- Go ahead and retract.

569
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,162
Houston, we have hard dock.

570
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,166
Roger, we understand.
That's a good deal, Jack.

571
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,828
Let's start back up
with procedure 17.

572
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,940
<i>Houston, we have LEM extraction.</i>

573
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,703
<i>We copy that,</i> 13.

574
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,306
<i>Now you're off to the Fra Mauro Highlands.</i>

575
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:39,040
- I gotta get out of this suit.
- Houston, we are ready...

576
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,345
for the beginning of the PTC...

577
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,684
and I think once we're in that barbecue roll,
Jack and I will eat.

578
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,657
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Are you sure?

579
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,853
I could eat the ass out of a dead rhinoceros.

580
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,293
- We got a smooth one?
- By the numbers so far.

581
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,395
We just ran a minimum load test
on the cooling system...

582
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:04,966
- See you tomorrow.
- Take care.

583
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,816
It's too bad
we can't demonstrate this on TV.

584
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,817
What a shame.

585
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,236
Overboard dump coming up.

586
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,067
Here it comes...

587
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,144
the constellation Urion.

588
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,274
<i>Now, that's a beautiful sight.</i>

589
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,254
Barbara, we are going
to your father's broadcast.

590
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,583
No! I'm never coming out!

591
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:58,319
I hate Paul! No one else
can ever play their records again!

592
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,828
She's still going on about
the stupid Beatles breaking up?

593
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,527
They're not stupid! You're stupid!

594
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,830
I know you're in mourning.

595
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,497
I'm not going, Mom!
Dad won't know if we're there!

596
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:12,702
The whole world is going to be watching
this broadcast, and so are we.

597
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,605
<i>Good evening, America...</i>

598
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,241
<i>and welcome aboard</i> Apollo 13.

599
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,714
<i>I'm Jim Lovell,
and we're broadcasting to you tonight...</i>

600
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:29,555
<i>from an altitude of almost 200,000 miles...</i>

601
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,522
<i>away from the face of the Earth...</i>

602
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,361
<i>and we have a pretty good show
in store for you tonight.</i>

603
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,765
<i>We are going to show you just what...</i>

604
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,700
<i>life is like for the three of us here...</i>

605
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,899
<i>in the vast expanse of outer space.</i>

606
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,910
<i>One of the first things we'd like to do...</i>

607
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:50,277
is provide you
with the appropriate background music.

608
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,641
So, hit it there, Freddo.

609
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:13,469
<i>That was supposed to be
the theme to</i> 2001...

610
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:16,029
<i>in honor of our command module, Odyssey.</i>

611
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,837
There seems to have been
a last-minute change in the program.

612
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:24,812
When I go up on <i>19,</i> I'm gonna take
my entire collection of Johnny Cash along.

613
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,979
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where's their broadcast?

614
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,055
All the networks dumped us.

615
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,183
One said we made going to the moon...

616
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,557
as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.

617
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,793
My son's supposed to be on.

618
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,965
He's in outer space.

619
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,898
This is all the channels we get, Mrs. Lovell.

620
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,739
It's that damn <i>TV Guide</i> again.

621
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,240
<i>Ruthless porters.</i>

622
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,975
<i>Savage baggage masters...</i>

623
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:15,161
Do they know they're not on the air?

624
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,127
We'll tell them when they get back.

625
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,906
<i>If anyone from the IRS is watching...</i>

626
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:29,503
<i>I forgot to file my 1040 return.</i>

627
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,672
<i>I meant to do it today...</i>

628
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,114
That's no joke. They'll jump on him.

629
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,749
Well, folks, let's head on down
to the lunar excursion module.

630
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,154
Follow me.

631
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,852
When we get ready
to land on the moon...

632
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:48,192
Fred Haise and I
will float through this access tunnel...

633
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,267
into the lunar module, leaving...

634
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:53,428
EECOM, that stir's gonna be...

635
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:56,632
on both H2 and both O2 tanks,
is that correct?

636
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,599
...the spacecraft will remain connected.

637
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:04,379
Well, folks, as you can probably tell...

638
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,611
the Aquarius isn't much bigger
than a couple of telephone booths.

639
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,582
The skin of the LEM in some places...

640
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:12,178
is only as...

641
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,286
as thick as a couple of layers...

642
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,851
of tinfoil, and that's all that protects us
from the vacuum of space.

643
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:23,727
We get away with this because the LEM
is designed only for flight in outer space.

644
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,861
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.

645
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,403
We'll head back up the tunnel now
and back into the Odyssey.

646
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,176
All right, we've returned to the...

647
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:44,086
Stand by one, Houston.

648
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,051
Gotcha!

649
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:51,118
Houston, that bang you heard
was Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.

650
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,129
He gets our hearts going
every time with that one.

651
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,800
We're about to close out the Aquarius...

652
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,003
and return to the Odyssey.

653
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:09,074
Our next broadcast will be from Fra Mauro
on the surface of the moon.

654
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,913
<i>So, this is the crew of the</i> Apollo 13...

655
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,176
<i>wishing everyone back on Earth...</i>

656
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,420
<i>a pleasant evening.</i>

657
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,261
All right.

658
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,959
Daddy was funny.

659
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,800
They might air a few minutes
on the news tonight.

660
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,462
You'd think so.

661
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,365
Bye.

662
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:41,976
Well, between Jack's back taxes
and the Fred Haise show...

663
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:46,043
I'd say that was
a pretty successful broadcast.

664
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,048
<i>That was an excellent show.</i>

665
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,551
Thank you very much, Houston.

666
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,849
We've got a couple
of housekeeping procedures.

667
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:56,518
We'd like you to roll right
to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

668
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:00,057
Roger that. Rolling right, 0-6-0.

669
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:08,801
And then if you could give
your oxygen tanks a stir.

670
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,039
Roger that.

671
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,673
We've got a problem here.

672
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,908
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I stirred the tanks.

673
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,214
This is Houston. Say again, please.

674
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,856
Houston, we have a problem.

675
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,785
We have a main bus B undervolt.

676
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:07,022
- We've got a lot of thruster activity.
- What's with the computer?

677
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,362
It just went off line.
There's another master alarm.

678
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,868
- I'm checking the quad.
- That was no repress valve.

679
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,871
Maybe it's in quad C.
I'll reconfigure the RCS.

680
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,039
We've got a ping light.

681
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:21,976
We've got multiple caution and warnings.
We've got to reset and restart.

682
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:23,843
I'm going to SCS.

683
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,482
Flight, their heart rates are skyrocketing.

684
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:33,216
- EECOM, what's your data telling you?
- O2 tank two not reading at all.

685
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:36,816
Tank one is at 725 psi and falling.

686
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:39,660
Fuel cells one and three are...

687
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,065
What's going on?
Flight, let me get back to you.

688
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:46,068
Flight, GNC. They're all over the place.

689
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:49,332
- They keep going close to gimbal lock.
- I keep losing radio signal.

690
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,374
Their antennae must be flipped around.

691
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:54,968
- They'll have to do it manually, if at all.
- One at a time, people.

692
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:58,974
Is this an instrumentation problem
or real power loss?

693
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,981
It's reading a quadruple failure.
That can't happen.

694
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,020
It's got to be instrumentation.

695
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,647
Get the hatch plugged.
A meteor may have hit the LEM.

696
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,726
The tunnel's really torquing
with all this movement.

697
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:14,061
Houston, we had a pretty large bang
associated with a master alarm.

698
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,962
Shit, it's main bus A.

699
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:20,162
<i>- Main bus A undervolt?</i>
- Main bus A undervolt down to...

700
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:24,804
It's reading 25-and-a-half.
Main bus B is reading zip now.

701
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,235
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

702
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,007
These guys are talking
about bangs and shimmies.

703
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:31,979
Doesn't sound like instrumentation.

704
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,574
<i>- You are breaking up.</i>
- Can't get this hatch to seal.

705
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:39,145
Just stow it. If we'd been hit by a meteor,
we'd be dead by now.

706
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,347
I'm gonna try to get us out of this.

707
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,984
Houston, did you say switch to omni bravo?

708
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:47,086
<i>- Roger that,</i> 13.
- The signal strength went way down.

709
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,691
It's fighting me. What's the story?
We keep flirting with gimbal lock.

710
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:54,362
<i>We need a confirmation.
What systems are down?</i>

711
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,868
SMRCS, Helium one...

712
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,239
A and C are barber pole.

713
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,412
Houston, I'm switching over
Quad C to main A.

714
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,572
<i>Roger that,</i> 13.

715
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,777
Okay, Houston, fuel cell one, fuel cell three.

716
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,388
We got a main bus B undervolt,
cryo pressure, suit compressor.

717
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,954
What don't we have?
AC bus one, AC bus two.

718
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,527
Command module computer. O2 flow high.

719
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,131
It may be a caution and warning failure.

720
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,603
Houston, we are venting
something out into space.

721
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,741
<i>I can see it outside window one right now.</i>

722
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,709
<i>It's definitely a gas of some sort.</i>

723
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,513
It's got to be the oxygen.

724
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,563
Roger, Odyssey. We copy your venting.

725
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:05,767
Give me an alignment.

726
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,277
Let's think about things
we can connect.

727
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,812
Let's start back at the beginning.

728
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,654
Listen up. Quiet down, people.

729
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,291
Let's stay cool, people.

730
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,270
Procedures, I need
another computer up in the RTCC.

731
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,830
I want everybody
to alert your support teams.

732
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,672
Wake up anybody you need
and get them in here.

733
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,111
Let's work the problem, people.

734
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,476
Let's not make things worse by guessing.

735
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:49,781
13, <i>this is Houston. We're going
around the room. We'll get you answers.</i>

736
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:53,819
<i>We keep venting, we're gonna keep
hitting the edge of that deadband.</i>

737
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,389
Take a look at the O2 on number one.

738
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,089
200 pounds and falling.

739
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,092
O2 tank two still zero.

740
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:09,695
- Tank one: 218 psi and falling.
<i>- Is that what you're getting? Confirm.</i>

741
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:14,540
<i>- We're seeing the same,</i> 13.
- Can we review our status, Sy?

742
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:18,775
Let's look at this thing
from a standpoint of status.

743
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,249
What have we got
on the spacecraft that's good?

744
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:30,753
I'll get back to you, Gene.

745
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,761
We're not gonna have power much longer.

746
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,396
The ship's bleeding to death.

747
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,334
- Flight?
<i>- Yeah. Go, EECOM.</i>

748
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:52,238
Flight, I recommend we shut down
the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

749
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,111
What the hell good is that gonna do?

750
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,617
If the leak's there, we can isolate it.

751
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:02,424
We can save what's left in the tanks,
and run on the good cell.

752
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:06,986
You close them, you can't open them again.
You can't land on the moon with one cell.

753
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,992
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

754
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,734
From my chair here, this is the last option.

755
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,771
Yeah. Okay, Sy.

756
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,559
Capcom, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

757
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,497
<i>13,</i> this is Houston.

758
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:49,828
We want you to close react valves
on cells one and three. Do you copy?

759
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,434
Are you saying you want the whole smash?

760
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:58,140
Closing down the react valves
for fuel cells shutdown?

761
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:02,308
Shutting down the fuel cells?
Did I hear you right?

762
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,013
Yeah, they heard me right.

763
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:09,315
Tell them we think that's the only way
they can stop the leak.

764
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:10,689
Yeah, Jim...

765
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,162
<i>we think that closing the react valves
may stop the leak.</i>

766
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,035
- Did he copy that?
- Do you copy, Jim?

767
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:31,180
Yes, Houston, we copy.

768
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,854
We just lost the moon.

769
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,760
Okay, Freddo, shut those down.

770
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:54,636
Let's see what this does.

771
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,046
If this doesn't work...

772
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,340
we're not gonna have enough power left
to get home.

773
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,496
- Shit!
- God damn it!

774
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,834
Houston, O2 on one is still falling.

775
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,510
How long does it take to power up the LEM?

776
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,708
Three hours by the checklist.

777
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,078
We don't have that much time.

778
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,746
Shit!

779
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,725
Jack, before the batteries
completely die on us in here...

780
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:53,422
let's power down everything so we can save
as much as we can for re-entry.

781
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:58,190
Fifteen minutes of oxygen, that's it.
The command module will be dead.

782
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,067
Okay, guys, listen up. Here's the drill.

783
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,172
We're moving the astronauts to the LEM.

784
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,935
We've got to get oxygen up there.

785
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,910
TELMU, Control, I want emergency
power procedure. Essential hardware only.

786
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:13,278
GNC, EECOM, we'll be shutting down
the command module at the same time.

787
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,250
We've to transfer the guidance system
to another computer.

788
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,185
I want those numbers up and ready
when they're in position.

789
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:23,556
Transfer all data over the LEM
computer before the command module dies.

790
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,856
The lunar module just became a lifeboat.

791
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:30,088
Odyssey, this is Houston.
We need you to power down immediately.

792
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,926
<i>Power up the LEM at the same time,
so get somebody over there.</i>

793
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,437
We already have Freddo in the LEM.

794
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,599
<i>We've got serious time pressure.</i>

795
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:41,268
<i>Get the guidance program transferred...</i>

796
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,937
<i>before you're out of power
in the command module...</i>

797
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:46,582
<i>or you're not gonna be able to navigate.</i>

798
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,650
How much time?
Can you give me a number?

799
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,950
We're looking at less than
15 minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

800
00:59:56,392 --> 01:00:00,056
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo.
It's worse than I thought.

801
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:05,630
<i>Houston, I've moved
from the command module into the LEM.</i>

802
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,297
If Jack can't get that data transferred
before they go dead...

803
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:12,671
They won't know which way they're pointed.

804
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,472
- That's a bad way to fly.
- I'll be in 210 if you need me.

805
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:20,842
<i>Houston, this is</i> 13.
<i>Are you back with me now?</i>

806
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:26,250
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.
You now have about 12 minutes to power up.</i>

807
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:30,691
I can't see any stars. Man, there's
a lot of debris floating around out there.

808
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:34,958
Houston, I have completed
the steps on Page 15.

809
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,999
I'm ready to power down the computer.

810
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:42,669
I'm gonna need your gimbal angles, Jack,
before you shut down the computer!

811
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,266
Okay, Jim.

812
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,309
I need this back before they power down.

813
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,810
All right, I got it. Hold on.

814
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,009
- Houston, our computer is up.
<i>- Roger. Stand by.</i>

815
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:58,154
<i>Jack, we need to proceed
with steps 12 through 17 quickly.</i>

816
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,714
<i>You're down to
about eight minutes remaining.</i>

817
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:05,386
Fuel cell pump's off.
O2 fans, tank two off.

818
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:09,532
Okay, Houston, check me.
I have completed the gimbal conversions...

819
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,933
but I need a double check of the arithmetic.

820
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:17,530
- Yeah, you can go, Jim.
- The roll CAL angle is minus two.

821
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:21,200
<i>Lunar module roll is 355.57.</i>

822
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:24,778
<i>Pitch: 1678, correction.</i>

823
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,782
<i>Pitch: 167.78.</i>

824
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,451
<i>Yaw is 351.87.</i>

825
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,078
Stand by. We're checking it.

826
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,624
<i>We've got negative visibility
in our star field...</i>

827
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:39,321
<i>and if this paperwork isn't right,
who knows where we'll end up out here.</i>

828
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:47,797
Looks good, Flight.

829
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,236
- It's all right.
- Good here.

830
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,636
- He's good, Andy.
- We'll go on those numbers.

831
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,335
<i>- You're good.</i>
- Log them in, Freddo.

832
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,037
<i>Turn off the IMU. Switch to SCS.</i>

833
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:59,248
<i>Stand by. Over.</i>

834
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,914
<i>It's a great day in New York.
It's girl watchers' weather.</i>

835
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:06,215
<i>I like the ingenious girl watchers
who wear Con Edison helmets...</i>

836
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:09,986
<i>and dig trenches in the street
to get a better view.</i>

837
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,255
<i>But speaking of girl watching...</i>

838
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:15,889
<i>did you know that our first bachelor
astronaut is on his way to the moon?</i>

839
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:18,490
<i>Is it Swigert? Yeah, first bachelor.</i>

840
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:22,834
<i>They say he's the kind who has a girl
in every port. He has that reputation.</i>

841
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:27,342
<i>He's sort of foolishly optimistic, taking
nylons and Hershey bars to the moon.</i>

842
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,877
<i>Did you read that three million...</i>

843
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,610
<i>What do you say?
Less viewers or fewer viewers?</i>

844
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:38,210
<i>Three million fewer viewers...</i>

845
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,618
<i>watched the space shot
than did the last one.</i>

846
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,228
<i>Here is ABC science editor
Jules Bergman.</i>

847
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:53,561
<i>The</i> Apollo 13 <i>spacecraft
has lost all electrical power...</i>

848
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:56,367
<i>astronauts Jim Lovell,
Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...</i>

849
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,965
<i>are making their way to the lunar module...</i>

850
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,874
<i>using it as a lifeboat
so they'll have electrical power...</i>

851
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,810
<i>for their radios on the command module.</i>

852
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,815
Apollo 13 <i>is apparently
also losing breathing oxygen...</i>

853
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:10,182
Slow down. An "electrical failure."
What exactly does that mean?

854
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,187
<i>The emergency has
ruled out any chance of a lunar landing...</i>

855
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,986
<i>and could endanger the lives
of the astronauts...</i>

856
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:20,155
<i>if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever
is left of the command module's oxygen...</i>

857
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,628
<i>can't last them
until they can get back to Earth.</i>

858
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,462
What do you mean, "no immediate danger"?

859
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:27,333
I heard they're losing oxygen.
Can they get back?

860
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:31,033
<i>The LEM's descent rocket engine
will be used in aborting the mission...</i>

861
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,302
<i>and getting them safely back to Earth.</i>

862
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,235
<i>Recapping what has happened:</i>

863
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:38,337
<i>The</i> Apollo 13 <i>astronauts
may be in grave clanger.</i>

864
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,178
No, don't give me that NASA bullshit!

865
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:42,684
I want to know
what's happening with my husband!

866
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:44,811
<i>We want to switch control
to the Aquarius now.</i>

867
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,583
- Roger that.
- Houston, wait!

868
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,420
<i>You're down
to about five minutes now.</i>

869
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:54,686
<i>Be aware our RCS isn't up here yet.
We have no attitude control on Aquarius.</i>

870
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,395
They don't have control?
Did we miss a step here?

871
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:02,664
- Control, what the hell happened?
- I don't know. We need more time.

872
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,537
<i>We're out of whack.</i>

873
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,169
I'm trying to pitch down
but we're yawing to the left.

874
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,111
Why can't I null this out?

875
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:15,174
<i>She wasn't designed
to fly attached like this.</i>

876
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:19,315
It's like flying with a dead elephant
on our back.

877
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,983
Flight, Guidance.
We're getting close to center here.

878
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:25,391
Watch that middle gimbal.
We don't want you tumbling off into space.

879
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,191
Inform them I'm well aware
of the goddamn gimbals!

880
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,626
- Roger that.
<i>- I don't need to hear the obvious.</i>

881
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,294
<i>I can see the trapping eight-ball!</i>

882
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,666
Andy, we're on VOX.

883
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:37,673
Aquarius, this is Houston.
We've got you both on VOX.

884
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,066
<i>You want us to go to VOX?</i>

885
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,403
<i>You have a hot mike.
We are reading everything you say.</i>

886
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,013
Sorry, Jim.

887
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,176
<i>It's only by a very narrow margin...</i>

888
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:53,211
<i>that we're going to get
Lovell, Haise and Swigert back alive.</i>

889
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:58,995
I'm sorry. Jeffrey's calling for you.

890
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:03,089
<i>...the terseness of Kraft
and the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.</i>

891
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:07,629
<i>This has been a very close call.
We're not out of the woods yet.</i>

892
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,575
Why are so many people here?

893
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,282
Your dad's flying his mission.

894
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,855
He said he was going
to get me a moon rock.

895
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,153
Right.

896
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:39,334
Something broke on
your daddy's spaceship...

897
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:44,605
and he's gonna have to turn around
before he even gets to the moon.

898
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:50,906
Was it the door?

899
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:55,412
13, <i>we still show that venting
pushing you around.</i>

900
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:58,044
<i>- How you doing?
- Houston, Aquarius.</i>

901
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:03,389
We've had to learn how to fly all over again,
but we are doing better now.

902
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:07,392
- Roger that, Aquarius.
- Have him close it out.

903
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,899
<i>Jack, we can close out
your procedure now.</i>

904
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,405
Do we know for sure
that we can power this thing back up?

905
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:19,600
<i>It's gonna get awfully cold in here.</i>

906
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:23,641
<i>Copy that, Jack.
We'll just have to deal with that later.</i>

907
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,175
- Computer off.
- We're clear.

908
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,643
We're going to the LEM.

909
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,446
We confirm shutdown, Jack.

910
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,515
<i>Lunar module now in control.</i>

911
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:45,658
<i>Roger that, Houston.
This is Odyssey signing off.</i>

912
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,713
Freddo, we're gonna have to execute
some sort of burn.

913
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,855
It's just a matter of when.

914
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:14,063
- Did they shut us all down in there?
- Yeah.

915
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,432
Didn't think we'd be back in here
so soon.

916
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:23,703
Houston, how far off course
do you project we are? Over.

917
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,241
Okay, people, listen up!

918
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:32,611
Gentlemen, I want you all
to forget the flight plan.

919
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:37,110
From this moment on,
we are improvising a new mission.

920
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,987
Sorry about that.
We'll get somebody to look at that.

921
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:45,625
How do we get our people home?

922
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,390
They are here.

923
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:52,331
- Do we turn them around, direct abort?
- Yes!

924
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:59,131
No, sir!
We get them on a free-return trajectory.

925
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,040
It's the option
with the fewest question marks for safety.

926
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:05,239
I agree. We use the moon's gravity
to slingshot them around.

927
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:09,011
No, the LEM will not support three guys
for that amount of time.

928
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:13,715
I think we've got to do a direct abort. We do
an about-face, bring the guys right home.

929
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,416
Get them back soon. Absolutely.

930
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,993
We don't even know
if the Odyssey's engine's working.

931
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,690
- If there's been serious damage to the craft...
- They blow up and they die!

932
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,199
That is not the argument!
We're talking about time!

933
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,395
- Not whether these guys...
- I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you!

934
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,938
Okay, hold it. Let's hold it down.

935
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:33,441
The only engine we've got
with enough power for a direct abort...

936
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,602
is the SPS on the service module.

937
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,271
It could have been damaged
in an explosion...

938
01:08:38,381 --> 01:08:40,008
so let's consider that engine dead.

939
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:42,176
We light it up, could blow the whole works.

940
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,777
Just too risky.
We're not gonna take that chance.

941
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,584
The only thing
the command module's good for is re-entry.

942
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:51,388
That leaves us with the LEM,
which means free-return trajectory.

943
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,895
Once we get the guys around the moon...

944
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,261
we'll fire up the LEM engine,
make a long burn...

945
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:59,096
pick up some speed,
and get them home as quick as we can.

946
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:02,933
Gene, I'm wondering
what the Grumman guys think about this.

947
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:07,306
We can't make any guarantees.
We designed the LEM to land on the moon...

948
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,845
not fire the engine for course corrections.

949
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:13,814
Well, unfortunately, we're not
landing on the moon, are we?

950
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:19,116
I don't care what anything was designed
to do. I care about what it can do.

951
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,556
So let's get to work. Let's lay it out, okay?

952
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:26,791
Capcom, Flight,
he says it will be ready in time.

953
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,989
After this burn, we've got to build time
in the flight plan for them to get sleep.

954
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:33,865
- Run it by the FAO.
- I've run it by the FAO.

955
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:36,131
Do we know how long
we're gonna fire that burn?

956
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:39,800
- He wanted a quote from a flight director.
- Who wanted a quote?

957
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,571
- The President.
- The President?

958
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,543
Nixon. He wants our odds.

959
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,879
We are not losing the crew.

960
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,641
Gene, I gotta give him
odds. Five to one against? Three to one?

961
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,087
- I don't think they're that good.
- We are not losing those men.

962
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,423
How long are they gonna have
to burn the engine PC + 2?

963
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,162
Look, tell him three to one.

964
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:11,005
<i>Expect loss of signal
in less than one minute.</i>

965
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:14,236
<i>When we pick you back up
we will have your PC + 2 burn data.</i>

966
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:18,906
Okay. Roger that, Houston. We'll hear
from you again at acquisition of signal.

967
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,309
You wanna look?

968
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,050
Oh, look at that.

969
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:38,730
<i>Aquarius, that's 30 seconds
until loss of signal.</i>

970
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,970
Mare Tranquillitatis.

971
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,476
Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.

972
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,507
Coming up on Mount Marilyn.

973
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:55,241
Jim, you gotta take a look at this.

974
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:58,343
I've seen it.

975
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,357
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

976
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:10,024
<i>We expect loss of signal
in approximately ten seconds.</i>

977
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:14,203
<i>So long, Earth. Catch you on the flip side.</i>

978
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,712
<i>When you go
into the shadow of the moon...</i>

979
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,214
<i>and the moon is between you and the sun...</i>

980
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:30,345
<i>you see stars that are more brilliant
than anything you've ever seen...</i>

981
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,478
<i>on the clearest nights here on Earth.</i>

982
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:37,492
<i>And then you pass into the lunar sunrise
over the lunar surface.</i>

983
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:42,892
<i>It must be an awe-inspiring sight.
I can't wait to see it myself.</i>

984
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:47,860
<i>The problem now is not so much a question
of adequate oxygen supply...</i>

985
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:50,064
<i>but it is the rate of consumption of water...</i>

986
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:53,266
<i>which is vitally needed
for the cooling operations...</i>

987
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,435
<i>to maintain the electronic systems...</i>

988
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,982
Look, it's Fra Mauro.

989
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,315
I can see our landing site.

990
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,461
Look at the Tsiolkovsky Crater.

991
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:51,899
I can't believe how bright
the ejecta blanket is.

992
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:54,868
It's like snow. It's beautiful.

993
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,474
That's Mare Imbrium to the north.

994
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:04,537
13, <i>this is Houston.</i>

995
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:08,372
<i>We're reading your telemetry.
It's good to see you again.</i>

996
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,937
Good to see you, too, Houston.

997
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:15,172
<i>We are picking you up
at a velocity of 7,062 feet per second...</i>

998
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,914
<i>at a distance from the moon
of 56 nautical miles.</i>

999
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:22,056
<i>Stand by for your PC + 2 burn data.</i>

1000
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:27,290
Got to tell you, I had an itch to take
this baby down, do some prospecting.

1001
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:30,562
Damn, we were close.

1002
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:35,897
Gentlemen, what are your intentions?

1003
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,907
I'd like to go home.

1004
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,605
We got a burn coming up.

1005
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,977
We're gonna need a contingency
if we lose comm with Houston.

1006
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,944
Let's get an idea where we stand
on the consumables.

1007
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,921
Jack, get into the Odyssey...

1008
01:14:56,992 --> 01:15:00,451
and bag up all the water you can
before it freezes in there.

1009
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:04,222
Let's go home.

1010
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:07,827
<i>Aquarius, we got some
PC + 2 burn data for you fellas.</i>

1011
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:12,898
So you're telling me
you can only give our guys 45 hours?

1012
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:16,110
That brings them to about there.

1013
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:22,284
Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.

1014
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:25,218
Gene, we've got to talk
about power.

1015
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,987
Guys! Power is everything!

1016
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,222
- Power is everything.
- What do you mean?

1017
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:34,455
Without it, they don't talk to us,
correct their trajectory...

1018
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,555
they don't turn the heat shield around.

1019
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:41,228
We gotta turn everything off. Now.
They're not gonna make it to re-entry.

1020
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:45,034
- What do you mean, "everything"?
- If everything's on, the LEM draws 60 amps.

1021
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:48,872
At that rate, in 16 hours
the batteries are dead, not 45.

1022
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,075
And so is the crew.
We gotta get them down to 12 amps.

1023
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:53,705
- Twelve amps?
- How many?

1024
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:56,080
You can't run a vacuum cleaner
on 12 amps, John.

1025
01:15:56,185 --> 01:15:59,712
We gotta turn off the radars, cabin heater...

1026
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:02,256
instrument displays,
guidance computer, everything.

1027
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,952
Guidance computer?
What if they need to do another burn?

1028
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,960
They won't know which way they're pointed.

1029
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,258
The more time we talk,
the more juice they waste.

1030
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,060
I've looked at data for the past hour.

1031
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:13,659
- That's the deal?
- That's the deal.

1032
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:22,938
Okay, John. The minute we finish the burn,
we'll power down the LEM.

1033
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,411
All right.

1034
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:29,448
Now, in the meantime, we're gonna have
a frozen command module up there.

1035
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:33,145
Soon, we'll have to power it up
using nothing but the re-entry batteries.

1036
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:36,953
- That's never been tried before.
- We've never even simulated it before.

1037
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:39,255
Well, we're gonna have to figure it out.

1038
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:42,791
I want people in our simulators
working re-entry scenarios.

1039
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:46,323
I want you to find every engineer
who designed every switch, circuit...

1040
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,925
transistor and light bulb up there.

1041
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:51,701
Then, talk to the guy in the assembly line
who actually built the thing.

1042
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:55,505
Find out how to squeeze every amp
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1043
01:16:56,178 --> 01:17:00,877
I want this mark all the way back to Earth
with time to spare.

1044
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:03,408
We never lost an American in space.

1045
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:06,050
We're sure as hell not gonna lose one
on my watch.

1046
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,885
Failure is not an option.

1047
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,698
- What?
- Good, you're not dead.

1048
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,631
I've been trying to get in touch with you
for 45 minutes.

1049
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,228
Jesus, what're you doing here?

1050
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,934
I gotta get you in the simulator.
We got a ship to land.

1051
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,238
- What?
- There's been an explosion.

1052
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:32,938
Oxygen tanks are gone, two fuel cells gone,
command module's shut down.

1053
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,644
- What about the crew?
- Crew's fine so far.

1054
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,878
Trying to keep them alive in the LEM.

1055
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,888
We'll have to shut that down
pretty soon, too.

1056
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,989
We got a lot of people working
the numbers on this one.

1057
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:46,891
Nobody's too sure
how much power we'll have for re-entry.

1058
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,897
The command module
will be frozen up pretty good by then.

1059
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:54,492
If you see this ammeter rise over 20
at any point, power-up is no good.

1060
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:57,265
If it spikes, that's <i>sayonara</i>
for the guidance computer.

1061
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,807
Our guys can't re-enter, okay?

1062
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,807
How much power
do we have to play with?

1063
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,344
Barely enough to run this
coffee pot for nine hours.

1064
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:05,903
- Go.
<i>- Ken Mattingly just got here.</i>

1065
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,675
Copy. He's here.

1066
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,375
They've been losing heat
since the accident.

1067
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:13,546
They'll start getting water condensation
on the control panels.

1068
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:15,555
Glad you're here.
You know what's going on?

1069
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:17,148
John's brought me up to speed.

1070
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:19,387
- What's left in the batteries?
- We don't know.

1071
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,895
We gotta get started
on some shortcuts for power-up.

1072
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:23,362
You know how short?

1073
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:27,334
It's all in the sequencing. If we can skip
whatever we don't absolutely need...

1074
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:29,996
- turn things on in the right order, maybe...
- I agree.

1075
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:33,599
- You started on a procedure?
- Engineers have tried, but it's your ship.

1076
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,200
- We gotta get you in there.
- Okay.

1077
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,938
Frank, I need the sim cold and dark.

1078
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,710
Give me the exact conditions
they've got in there now.

1079
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:44,412
- I need status of every instrument.
- You got it.

1080
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:47,512
I need a flashlight.
That's not what they have up there.

1081
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,819
Don't give me anything
they don't have on board.

1082
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:53,225
Let's get this show on the road.
Put him in space, fellas.

1083
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:58,363
Okay, Houston, the quad-heater
circuit breakers are open.

1084
01:18:58,433 --> 01:18:59,457
<i>Copy that.</i>

1085
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,503
We'll use the forward omni
when the Earth's in the window...

1086
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:05,198
and we're switching to aft omni
when we see the moon.

1087
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:06,934
<i>We copy that,</i> 13.

1088
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:09,842
<i>Aquarius, we don't want you
to make any more waste dumps.</i>

1089
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:12,505
<i>The venting may push you off course.</i>

1090
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:15,177
- Oh, Christ.
- What's up?

1091
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:19,652
No more waste dumps.
We're just gonna have to store it.

1092
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,386
Jack, we're gonna need
some more urine bags.

1093
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:26,784
Okay, Houston,
that leaves us with just the computer...

1094
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,559
which I'm shutting down now.

1095
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,528
And that's it.

1096
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:41,871
We just put Sir Isaac Newton
in the driver's seat.

1097
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:48,980
Is it a.m. or p.m.?

1098
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:52,581
A.m. Very, very a.m.

1099
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:55,213
Haise is running a temperature,
and no one has slept.

1100
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:59,260
I can't order these guys to go to sleep.
Could you sleep up there?

1101
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:02,262
It's gonna get awful cold
in there for those guys.

1102
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:06,930
Gene, we have a situation
brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1103
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,402
We got a CO2 filter problem
on the lunar module.

1104
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:13,031
- Five filters on the LEM.
- Meant for two guys for a day and a half.

1105
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:15,509
- I told the doc...
- We're up to eight on the gauges.

1106
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,911
Anything over 15
and you get impaired judgment, blackouts...

1107
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,447
the beginnings of brain asphyxia.

1108
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,449
What about scrubbers
in the command module?

1109
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:26,044
- They take square cartridges.
- The ones on the LEM are round.

1110
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:29,448
Tell me this isn't a government operation.

1111
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:32,357
This just isn't a contingency
we've remotely looked at.

1112
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,623
Those CO2 levels
will be getting toxic.

1113
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:39,633
I suggest you gentlemen invent a way to put
a square peg in a round hole. Rapidly.

1114
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:45,105
Okay, people, listen up!

1115
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:49,974
The people upstairs have handed us
this one, and we gotta come through.

1116
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:54,010
We gotta find a way to make this...

1117
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:56,980
fit into the hole for this...

1118
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,243
using nothing but that.

1119
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:04,154
- Let's get it organized.
- Okay, let's build a filter.

1120
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:06,717
Better get some coffee going, too.

1121
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:10,056
<i>The Haise family
lives in El lago, Texas.</i>

1122
01:21:10,132 --> 01:21:12,828
<i>His wife, Mary, is from Biloxi, Mississippi.</i>

1123
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:17,167
<i>When Fred Haise was growing up in Biloxi,
he may have looked ahead to a fine family...</i>

1124
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:18,671
<i>but he never dreamt of flying.</i>

1125
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,333
<i>I'd never flown
before I went into the service...</i>

1126
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:25,311
<i>and I only went into the flying business
as a means to getting a commission...</i>

1127
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:28,850
- Good morning.
- Henry. Don't you ever sleep?

1128
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:32,048
I have a request from the news people.

1129
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:36,348
They're out front here and they want
to put a transmitter up on the lawn.

1130
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,627
Transmitter?

1131
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,389
It's kind of a tower for a live broadcast.

1132
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:52,072
I thought they didn't care about the mission.
They didn't even run Jim's show.

1133
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,041
Well, it's more dramatic now.
Suddenly people are...

1134
01:21:56,144 --> 01:22:00,172
If landing on the moon wasn't dramatic
enough, why should not landing on it be?

1135
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:04,614
Look, I realize how hard this is, Marilyn...

1136
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,619
but the whole world is caught up in it.

1137
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:09,418
- It's the biggest story since...
- No, Henry.

1138
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:14,226
Those people don't put one piece
of equipment on my lawn.

1139
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:18,089
If they have a problem with that,
they can take it up with my husband.

1140
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:20,328
He'll be home on Friday.

1141
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,047
Hey, Fred.

1142
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:08,839
It's too cold in there.

1143
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:25,926
That's a nice one of Mary.

1144
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:32,835
- You don't look too good, Freddo.
- I'll survive.

1145
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:35,240
- There's aspirin in the medical kit.
- I took some.

1146
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,108
Jim, I'm all right.

1147
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:46,047
It was an accident, Mary getting pregnant.

1148
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:51,389
You should have seen the look on my face
when she told me.

1149
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:54,956
Well, that has a tendency to happen.

1150
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:04,798
I wonder if it's a boy or a girl.

1151
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:08,710
You're gonna find out soon enough.

1152
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:10,838
Sure.

1153
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:17,847
I never dreamed I'd ever get
to do something like this.

1154
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:20,683
Come up here on a real mission.

1155
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,290
Most of the guys I graduated
high school with...

1156
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,725
never even left home, and here I am.

1157
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,358
Oh, yeah.

1158
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:30,929
Here you are.

1159
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:38,373
It hurts when I urinate.

1160
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:43,901
- Well, you're not getting enough water.
- I'm drinking my ration the same as you.

1161
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,877
I think old Swigert gave me the clap.

1162
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:53,718
He's been pissing in my relief tube.

1163
01:24:56,491 --> 01:25:00,485
Well, that will be a hot one
at the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1164
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:04,623
That's another first
for America's space program.

1165
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:11,735
Listen, I've been going over some stuff...

1166
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:17,373
and I'm a little worried about this cold
affecting our battery efficiency.

1167
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:22,179
We quit heating the glycol to save
water and power, so that's not helping.

1168
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,241
It could cost us amp hours
on the back end?

1169
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,547
That's a possibility.

1170
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,714
I've been going over
the numbers again.

1171
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:30,314
Have they called up with a re-entry plan yet?

1172
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:32,883
- We're coming in too shallow...
- We're working on it.

1173
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:36,658
I can't remember the ratio to temperature.
We got no references on board.

1174
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:39,030
Let's see if Houston
can pull up the mil specs...

1175
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:42,900
Listen, they gave us too much Delta V.
They had us burn too long.

1176
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:46,531
At this rate we'll skip right out
of the atmosphere, and never get back.

1177
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:50,177
What are you talking about?
How'd you figure that?

1178
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:51,710
I can add.

1179
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:57,178
- Many PhDs are working on this.
- Houston says we're on the money.

1180
01:25:57,252 --> 01:26:00,244
What if they made a mistake
and there was no way to reverse it?

1181
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:01,618
You think they'd tell us?

1182
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:04,989
- There's no reason to tell us!
- What do you mean? That's bullshit!

1183
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:07,528
There's 1,000 things
that have to happen in order.

1184
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:12,498
We are on number eight.
You're talking about number 692.

1185
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,832
In the meantime, I'm trying to tell you
we're coming in too fast.

1186
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:19,271
I think they know it, and that's why
we don't have a re-entry plan.

1187
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,536
That's duly noted. Thank you, Jack.

1188
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:24,844
God damn this piece of shit!

1189
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:27,941
This piece of shit's gonna get you home.

1190
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:31,645
That's because that's the only thing
we've got left, Jack!

1191
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:36,386
- What are you saying, Fred?
- I think you know what I'm saying.

1192
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:39,552
Now wait a minute.
All I did was stir those tanks.

1193
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:42,130
What was the gauge reading
before you hit the switch?

1194
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:45,655
Don't tell me how to fly the CM!
They brought me in to do a job!

1195
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:48,965
They asked me to stir the damn tanks,
and I stirred the tanks!

1196
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,802
- Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
- This is not my fault!

1197
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,807
No one is saying it is.

1198
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:57,840
If I'm in the left-hand seat
when the call comes up, I stir the tanks.

1199
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:58,970
Well, tell him that.

1200
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,278
I just asked you what the gauge
was reading, and you don't know!

1201
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:04,215
Look, we're not doing this, gentlemen.

1202
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:07,050
We're not bouncing off the walls
for ten minutes...

1203
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:10,057
because we'll just end up
with the same problems!

1204
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,752
Try to figure out how to stay alive!

1205
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:15,793
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1206
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:18,594
- Are we on VOX?
- No, we're not on VOX.

1207
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:21,258
Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius. Go ahead.

1208
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:25,896
<i>Yeah, Jim, could you check
your CO2 gauge for us?</i>

1209
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:31,103
We were just looking at that.

1210
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:35,138
Our CO2 measurement
has jumped four notches in the last hour.

1211
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:38,343
That can't be right.
I went over those numbers three times.

1212
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:41,946
<i>Jim, that sounds about right.
We were expecting that.</i>

1213
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:45,626
That's very comforting to know, Houston.
What do we do about it?

1214
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:48,822
<i>Jim, we're working
on a procedure down here for you.</i>

1215
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:52,696
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- Oh, Christ.

1216
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,031
All right, we're standing by
for those procedures.

1217
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,537
Christ, I know why my numbers are wrong.

1218
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:00,874
I only figured it for two people.

1219
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:07,272
Maybe I should just hold my breath.

1220
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,012
<i>The deadly CO2 gas
is literally poisoning...</i>

1221
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:13,315
<i>the astronauts with every breath in and out.</i>

1222
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:14,719
Heads up.

1223
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:18,283
Go.

1224
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,120
Heads up, people. Look out now.

1225
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:28,001
- What's this?
- That's what they gotta make.

1226
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,464
I hope you got
the procedures for me.

1227
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:31,562
Right here.

1228
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:33,005
That's it?

1229
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:37,737
<i>All right, Aquarius,
this is Houston.</i>

1230
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:39,837
<i>Do you have a flight plan up there?</i>

1231
01:28:39,948 --> 01:28:43,076
Affirmative, Andy. Jack's got one right here.

1232
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:46,951
Okay, we have an unusual procedure
for you here.

1233
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:48,956
<i>We need you to rip the cover off.</i>

1234
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:51,786
He wants you
to rip the cover off the flight plan.

1235
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,919
With pleasure.

1236
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,528
<i>The other materials
you'll need are...</i>

1237
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:58,697
a lithium hydroxide canister...

1238
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,667
Two lithium hydroxide canisters, I'm sorry...

1239
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:04,000
- a roll of gray tape.
- Duct tape.

1240
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:08,008
<i>Duct tape. You need
an LCG bag... Two LCG bags...</i>

1241
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:12,370
<i>the red suit hoses,
and you've got the flight plan cover.</i>

1242
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,249
What about their level of carbon dioxide?

1243
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,016
It's climbing.

1244
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,156
You're saying
that they're almost out of breathable air?

1245
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:30,562
Wait a second. That's not what he said.
He said we're working on it.

1246
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:34,231
<i>You want to cut the duct tape
three feet long.</i>

1247
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:36,497
- Tell him to use his arm.
- Just use your arm.

1248
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:39,506
<i>- It's an arm's length.</i>
- Okay, I see what you're getting at.

1249
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:42,805
Jack, tear that piece of tape
down the middle lengthwise.

1250
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:45,175
<i>- All right?</i>
- Hold on, Houston.

1251
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:50,075
<i>While the astronauts appear to have
enough oxygen to keep them alive...</i>

1252
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:53,382
<i>one thing they have
too much of is carbon dioxide.</i>

1253
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:55,354
<i>With each breath, the three men expel...</i>

1254
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:58,484
<i>more of the poisonous gas
into the lunar module cockpit...</i>

1255
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:01,552
<i>and the scrubbers intended
to keep the atmosphere breathable...</i>

1256
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:03,824
<i>are quickly becoming saturated.</i>

1257
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:07,999
Oh, shit, I tore it.

1258
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:15,741
Houston, what do we do
if we ripped the bag? Can we tape it?

1259
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,878
- They just tore the bag.
- Oh, no.

1260
01:30:17,945 --> 01:30:21,905
- Stand by. What should I tell them to do?
- They should have one more bag left.

1261
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:24,713
<i>But they've still got a long way to come...</i>

1262
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:29,724
<i>and are now working on backup facilities,
their emergency facilities.</i>

1263
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:33,691
<i>The problem is, if anything more
goes wrong, they're in real trouble.</i>

1264
01:31:03,157 --> 01:31:07,026
<i>As most of you are aware,
there is no rescue possible in space flight.</i>

1265
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:11,224
<i>Any rescue system the space agency
has long since calculated...</i>

1266
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:15,161
<i>Any rescue system
the space agency calculated...</i>

1267
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:20,932
One sock.

1268
01:31:21,008 --> 01:31:22,704
<i>Once you have
the sock in place...</i>

1269
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,870
<i>- we're gonna want you...</i>
- Work it in.

1270
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:28,347
<i>...to bungee the entire filter assembly
to the bulkhead...</i>

1271
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:31,351
<i>- right above the LEM canister.</i>
- We're getting close to 15.

1272
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:37,420
So how does this flight compare
to other emergency situations you've faced?

1273
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:41,253
I'll have to say
that this is the most serious situation...

1274
01:31:41,362 --> 01:31:43,763
we've ever encountered
in manned space flight.

1275
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:47,597
- Houston, filter's in place.
- Cabin gas return to egress.

1276
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:50,567
Suit circuit relief to close.

1277
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:53,867
- CO2 canister select to secondary.
- All right.

1278
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,009
Here goes.

1279
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:00,380
I can hear air moving.

1280
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:15,524
Just breathe normal, fellas.

1281
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:20,229
<i>Aquarius,
please advise on CO2 status.</i>

1282
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:24,366
Houston, we're taking a look
at those numbers now.

1283
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:31,179
<i>We're still holding close to 15, Houston.</i>

1284
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:33,371
<i>Roger that. Standing by.</i>

1285
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:47,592
Houston, the CO2 level
has dropped to nine...

1286
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:51,022
and it is still falling.

1287
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,831
That is good to hear, Aquarius.

1288
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:00,841
And you, sir, are a steely-eyed missile man.

1289
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,276
Okay, spacecraft control to computer.

1290
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:10,477
Damn!

1291
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,615
We overloaded.

1292
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:19,489
<i>We used way too much power.</i>

1293
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:23,826
<i>There must be a sneak circuit
someplace between step seven and ten.</i>

1294
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:26,127
All right, which one has the leak?

1295
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:29,101
I don't know that yet, John.

1296
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:32,868
The sequence was wrong. We just
have to go back and try them one at a time.

1297
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:35,667
You need a break, Ken?

1298
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:38,675
If they don't get one, I don't get one.

1299
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:45,345
Well, if it won't work,
get me another one.

1300
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,684
- My son's supposed to be on.
- I know, Mrs. Lovell.

1301
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:50,223
Hi, Blanch.

1302
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:53,817
They can't fix a damn thing in this place.

1303
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:56,326
Blanch, it's Marilyn.

1304
01:33:57,031 --> 01:33:58,499
Hi, Grandma.

1305
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,391
I was gonna see Jimmy.

1306
01:34:01,769 --> 01:34:02,793
I know.

1307
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:07,772
We came to tell you something.

1308
01:34:08,543 --> 01:34:12,138
There's been an accident.
Jimmy's okay, he's all right.

1309
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:17,608
But he's not gonna get to walk on the moon.

1310
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:20,444
Well, they said he was.

1311
01:34:21,088 --> 01:34:23,114
I know.

1312
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,227
That was before.

1313
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:30,894
Now there's been an explosion,
and they're all okay...

1314
01:34:30,965 --> 01:34:34,993
they're all right.
But now they're just going to...

1315
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:39,305
try to figure out a way to get them home.

1316
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,647
And it's a little bit dangerous.

1317
01:34:49,116 --> 01:34:50,584
Oh, sweetie.

1318
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:56,147
Are you scared?

1319
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:02,828
Well, don't you worry, honey.

1320
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:06,867
If they could get a washing machine to fly...

1321
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:10,393
my Jimmy could land it.

1322
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:53,478
<i>Jack, you'll be happy to hear
we contacted President Nixon...</i>

1323
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:57,577
<i>and he's gonna grant you
an extension on your income taxes...</i>

1324
01:35:57,818 --> 01:36:01,550
<i>since you are most decidedly
out of the country.</i>

1325
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:05,656
Roger that, Houston.

1326
01:36:06,027 --> 01:36:07,961
That's wonderful news.

1327
01:36:08,029 --> 01:36:09,997
Tell them they have to sleep.

1328
01:36:10,064 --> 01:36:12,499
Haise is running a fever of 104.

1329
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:16,462
<i>13,</i> we've got another request
from the flight surgeon...

1330
01:36:16,537 --> 01:36:18,562
that you fellas get some more sleep.

1331
01:36:18,673 --> 01:36:21,471
<i>He doesn't like his readings down here.</i>

1332
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:23,833
Let's see how he feels about this.

1333
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:27,245
I am sick and tired
of the entire western world...

1334
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:30,878
knowing how my kidneys are functioning!

1335
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:37,551
Flight, I just lost Lovell.

1336
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:44,095
<i>13,</i> this is Houston.

1337
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:48,034
<i>Jim, we just had a dropout
on your bio-med sensors.</i>

1338
01:36:48,436 --> 01:36:51,030
I'm not wearing
my bio-med sensors, Houston.

1339
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,913
Okay, Jim. Copy that.

1340
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,092
Now I'm losing all three of them!

1341
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:25,398
It's just a little medical mutiny, Doc.

1342
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:28,171
I'm sure the guys are still with us.

1343
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:31,611
Let's cut them some slack, okay?

1344
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:46,159
Gene, it's not the velocity, it's the angle.

1345
01:37:46,727 --> 01:37:50,664
Maybe they're still venting something
and that's throwing off the trajectory...

1346
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:52,529
but we are definitely shallowing again.

1347
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:55,398
- We are up to a 5.9.
- Damn it.

1348
01:37:55,503 --> 01:37:59,064
At this rate, they nick the atmosphere
and bounce off into space.

1349
01:37:59,173 --> 01:38:01,198
We need another burn to get them back.

1350
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:03,869
- Another burn.
- Fire the engines, get them on course.

1351
01:38:03,944 --> 01:38:04,968
Copy that.

1352
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,659
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1353
01:38:28,803 --> 01:38:30,168
Houston, Aquarius.

1354
01:38:31,338 --> 01:38:34,103
<i>Jim, we've got
another course correction for you.</i>

1355
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:35,940
What's up?

1356
01:38:36,677 --> 01:38:38,839
Something about another course correction.

1357
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:41,074
We copy, Houston.

1358
01:38:42,283 --> 01:38:46,083
Be advised, it's gonna take Freddo and I
a while to power up the computer...

1359
01:38:46,153 --> 01:38:49,749
for the alignment platform
if we have to fire the engine.

1360
01:38:49,824 --> 01:38:53,988
<i>Negative on that, Jim.
We can't spare power for the computer.</i>

1361
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:56,989
We gotta do this blind?

1362
01:38:57,097 --> 01:39:00,590
Houston, without the computer,
what do we use for orientation?

1363
01:39:01,035 --> 01:39:03,902
Come on, we gotta be able
to give these guys something.

1364
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:05,336
Without the power,
we can't give them a reading.

1365
01:39:06,574 --> 01:39:08,599
Not power. I'm talking about reference.

1366
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:11,770
No, there's no references.
We have a bunch of debris up there...

1367
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:14,780
Houston, what's the story with this burn?

1368
01:39:15,082 --> 01:39:18,018
<i>We're trying to hash
something out down here, Aquarius.</i>

1369
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:19,616
<i>Stand by.</i>

1370
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:24,884
Look, Houston, all we need to hold attitude
is one fixed point in space.

1371
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:28,586
- Is that not correct?
<i>- Yeah. Roger that, Jim.</i>

1372
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,294
Well, Houston, we've got one.

1373
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,996
If we can keep the Earth
in the window, flying manually...

1374
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:42,066
<i>the crosshairs right on its terminator...</i>

1375
01:39:42,176 --> 01:39:45,407
<i>all I have to know is,
how long do we need to burn the engine?</i>

1376
01:39:45,512 --> 01:39:48,482
- The shorter, the better.
- Roger that, Jim.

1377
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:51,550
Can they fly it manually
and still shut it down on time...

1378
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,051
without the computer?

1379
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:58,055
I guess that's the best we can do.

1380
01:39:58,158 --> 01:39:59,683
We're out of time.

1381
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,990
<i>In order to enter the atmosphere safely...</i>

1382
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:05,362
<i>the crew must aim for a corridor
just two-and-a-half degrees wide.</i>

1383
01:40:05,432 --> 01:40:09,028
<i>If they're too steep, they'll incinerate
in the steadily thickening air.</i>

1384
01:40:09,103 --> 01:40:12,095
<i>If they're too shallow,
they'll ricochet off the atmosphere...</i>

1385
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:13,571
<i>like a rock skipping off a pond.</i>

1386
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:18,168
<i>The re-entry corridor is, in fact, so narrow
that if this basketball were the Earth...</i>

1387
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:22,409
<i>and this softball were the moon,
and the two were placed 14 feet apart...</i>

1388
01:40:22,616 --> 01:40:26,780
<i>the crew would have to hit a target
no thicker than this piece of paper.</i>

1389
01:40:26,887 --> 01:40:29,356
On your toes. We're doing this one blind.

1390
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:32,051
Gene, understand
that we've never tried this before:

1391
01:40:32,126 --> 01:40:36,119
burn, cold soak, burn, cold soak,
burn, manual control.

1392
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:38,130
Look, it will ignite, will it not?

1393
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:41,793
I just want you to know
the engine's never been tried like this.

1394
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:44,303
That's all I'm trying to tell you.

1395
01:40:44,405 --> 01:40:48,705
I know what you're trying to do. I guarantee
I won't hold you personally responsible.

1396
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:52,041
If it lights, it lights. Let Lovell do the rest.

1397
01:40:52,813 --> 01:40:53,974
Okay.

1398
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:56,645
<i>They'll burn the engine
and steer manually...</i>

1399
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:59,311
<i>attempting to keep the Earth in the window.</i>

1400
01:41:06,627 --> 01:41:08,857
Okay, this is gonna take all three of us.

1401
01:41:09,630 --> 01:41:13,362
Freddo, you handle the pitch.

1402
01:41:13,867 --> 01:41:16,427
Put on the translation controllers,
all backwards...

1403
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:19,597
so if the Earth starts drifting down...

1404
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:22,870
you need to thrust aft, not forward.

1405
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:25,872
I'll do the same on mine
with everything else.

1406
01:41:26,046 --> 01:41:29,448
We're going to burn at 10% thrust
for 39 seconds. Jack, you time us.

1407
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:30,642
Got it.

1408
01:41:30,984 --> 01:41:34,944
Give us a count of the last 10 seconds
up to 39. Let's not miss this.

1409
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:40,583
You up to this, Freddo?

1410
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:43,986
I'm with you.

1411
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:47,894
Standing by for corridor control burn.

1412
01:41:47,968 --> 01:41:50,562
Okay, Jim, you can fire when ready.

1413
01:41:50,804 --> 01:41:53,137
<i>You are go for the manual burn.</i>

1414
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,676
Okay, X-plus button at 10 seconds. Mark.

1415
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:59,641
- Come on, baby. One more burn.
- Nine, eight...

1416
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:02,338
seven, six, five...

1417
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,679
- four, three...
- Ullage is go.

1418
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:07,345
<i>...two, one, ignition!</i>

1419
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:10,814
She's burning!

1420
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:13,889
- Master arm off.
- Okay, here we go.

1421
01:42:14,027 --> 01:42:17,293
<i>- Helium regulator on.
- RCS is go, 10% thrust.</i>

1422
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:21,457
<i>- Bring her around, Freddo.
- I'm trying but it's dragging.</i>

1423
01:42:21,869 --> 01:42:24,565
- Ten seconds.
<i>- Drop it down, Freddo.</i>

1424
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:26,572
<i>- We're drifting!
- No, hold what you got.</i>

1425
01:42:26,673 --> 01:42:28,904
<i>- I'll roll it. Backoff.
- Can't get it stable.</i>

1426
01:42:29,009 --> 01:42:31,478
She's dancing all over the place!

1427
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:34,412
- Come to the right a little bit.
- Fifteen seconds.

1428
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:36,710
<i>She's drifting. I'm losing attitude.</i>

1429
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:39,377
<i>Hold it right there.
That's it. No, Freddo, back!</i>

1430
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:41,716
<i>- Shit! I'm losing it!
- Bring the Earth up.</i>

1431
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:44,154
Thrust forward, Fred. Come on.

1432
01:42:44,792 --> 01:42:47,625
Shit, I lost it! Where is it?

1433
01:42:47,694 --> 01:42:49,720
<i>7:00. Helium regulator's closed.</i>

1434
01:42:50,397 --> 01:42:52,525
Bring it down, Freddo. Just nose it down.

1435
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:54,362
- Okay, I got it!
- Thirty seconds.

1436
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:56,493
<i>Little farther. Ease your touch!</i>

1437
01:42:57,805 --> 01:43:00,672
Damn it, that's mine. That's me. Around.

1438
01:43:02,643 --> 01:43:05,703
- A little more. Come on, baby.
- That's it. Hold it.

1439
01:43:05,779 --> 01:43:08,806
- Back! That's it! Hold it! Steady.
- ...eight, nine!

1440
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:10,247
Shutdown!

1441
01:43:21,128 --> 01:43:23,119
Houston, we have shutdown.

1442
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:25,858
<i>That's close enough, Jim.
Good work.</i>

1443
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:30,537
I knew it! How about that LEM!
How about it?

1444
01:43:32,372 --> 01:43:34,841
- Guess you can keep your job.
- You betcha.

1445
01:43:34,908 --> 01:43:38,845
13, <i>stand by. We're evaluating
our power usage on that burn.</i>

1446
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:43,047
Let's hope we don't have to do that again.

1447
01:43:56,964 --> 01:44:01,196
Gentlemen, you've given our guys
enough to survive till re-entry.

1448
01:44:02,503 --> 01:44:03,868
Well done.

1449
01:44:07,307 --> 01:44:10,641
Now we gotta get them in,
so tell me about the power-up procedures.

1450
01:44:10,711 --> 01:44:13,180
Here's the order of what I want to do.

1451
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:17,081
I want to power up guidance,
ECS, communications...

1452
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:22,014
warm up the pyros for the parachutes
and the command module thrusters.

1453
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:24,986
The thrusters will put you
over budget on amps.

1454
01:44:25,159 --> 01:44:29,152
They've been sitting at 200 below
for four days. They gotta be heated.

1455
01:44:29,229 --> 01:44:31,220
Fine. Then trade off the parachutes.

1456
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:35,568
- If the chutes don't open, what's the point?
- You're telling me what you need.

1457
01:44:35,669 --> 01:44:39,435
I'm telling you what we have to work with.
I'm not making this stuff up.

1458
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,599
They're going to need all these systems.

1459
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:45,201
We do not have the power, Ken.
We just don't have it.

1460
01:44:48,882 --> 01:44:52,614
I'll reorganize the sequencing again
and find more power.

1461
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,089
Let's start from scratch. Clear the board.

1462
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:01,759
I don't know where the hell we'll find it.

1463
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:06,156
Apollo 13 <i>commander Jim Lovell
has more time in space...</i>

1464
01:45:06,266 --> 01:45:09,133
<i>almost 24 days already,
than any other man...</i>

1465
01:45:09,202 --> 01:45:11,831
<i>and I asked him recently
if he ever was scared.</i>

1466
01:45:11,939 --> 01:45:15,102
<i>I've had an engine flame out
a few times in an aircraft...</i>

1467
01:45:15,175 --> 01:45:20,079
<i>and was curious as to whether it was going
to light up again, things of that nature...</i>

1468
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:22,240
<i>but they seem to work out.</i>

1469
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:24,144
<i>Is there an instance...</i>

1470
01:45:24,217 --> 01:45:27,449
<i>in an airplane emergency
when you can recall fear?</i>

1471
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:31,689
<i>Well, I remember this one time...</i>

1472
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:35,592
<i>in a Banshee at night in combat conditions,
so the carrier has no lights.</i>

1473
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:38,291
<i>It was the</i> Shangri-la.
<i>We were in the Sea of Japan.</i>

1474
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:41,994
<i>My radar had jammed,
and my homing signal was gone...</i>

1475
01:45:42,102 --> 01:45:45,470
<i>because somebody in Japan
was using the same frequency...</i>

1476
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:49,104
<i>and so it was leading me away
from where I was supposed to be.</i>

1477
01:45:49,543 --> 01:45:54,447
<i>I'm looking down at a big, black ocean,
so I flip on my map light.</i>

1478
01:45:54,881 --> 01:45:58,545
<i>Then, suddenly, zap! Everything shorts out
right there in my cockpit.</i>

1479
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:02,919
<i>All my instruments and lights are gone,
I can't even tell what my altitude is.</i>

1480
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:08,286
<i>I know I'm running out of fuel,
so I'm thinking about ditching in the ocean.</i>

1481
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:11,957
<i>I look down there,
and then in the darkness...</i>

1482
01:46:12,065 --> 01:46:14,694
<i>there's this green trail.</i>

1483
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:19,271
<i>It's like a long carpet that's just laid
out beneath me. It was the algae!</i>

1484
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:24,468
<i>It was that phosphorescent stuff that gets
churned up in the wake of a big ship.</i>

1485
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:26,808
<i>It was just leading me home.</i>

1486
01:46:27,114 --> 01:46:30,208
<i>And if my cockpit lights
hadn't shorted out...</i>

1487
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:32,582
<i>there's no way
I'd have ever been able to see that.</i>

1488
01:46:32,653 --> 01:46:35,213
<i>So, you never know...</i>

1489
01:46:35,322 --> 01:46:38,758
<i>what events are going to transpire
to get you home.</i>

1490
01:46:43,563 --> 01:46:47,466
<i>Spacecraft commander
Jim Lovell, no stranger to emergency is he.</i>

1491
01:46:58,645 --> 01:47:01,342
- How's it going, Fred?
- I'm okay.

1492
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:05,480
What the hell was that?

1493
01:47:06,386 --> 01:47:08,685
Let's hope it was just the burst disk.

1494
01:47:08,755 --> 01:47:12,817
- Can you confirm a burst helium disk?
<i>- We confirm that.</i>

1495
01:47:12,993 --> 01:47:16,656
Houston, is that going to affect
our entry angle at all?

1496
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:20,496
<i>Negative. Your entry angle
is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.</i>

1497
01:47:21,234 --> 01:47:22,600
Houston...

1498
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:28,700
we sure could use
the re-entry procedure up here.

1499
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:31,669
<i>When can we expect that?</i>

1500
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:36,380
That's coming real soon, Aquarius.

1501
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,042
Houston, we...

1502
01:47:39,019 --> 01:47:42,114
We just can't throw this together
at the last minute.

1503
01:47:42,255 --> 01:47:44,622
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1504
01:47:44,925 --> 01:47:48,588
You're gonna get the procedure up to us,
whatever it is...

1505
01:47:48,795 --> 01:47:52,925
and we're gonna go over it step by step,
so there's no foul-ups.

1506
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:56,867
I don't have to tell you
we're all a little tired up here.

1507
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:59,735
The world's getting awfully big
in the window.

1508
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,441
- Jim, this is Deke.
- It's Deke.

1509
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:05,140
They don't know how to do it.

1510
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:07,272
Maybe Jack's right.

1511
01:48:08,849 --> 01:48:10,715
Hello, Deke. What's the story?

1512
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:14,777
We're gonna get that procedure to you
as soon as we possibly can.

1513
01:48:14,888 --> 01:48:17,255
<i>Ken Mattingly's in the simulator right now.</i>

1514
01:48:18,592 --> 01:48:20,424
Ken's working on it?

1515
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:27,725
Look, I know this sequence works, John.

1516
01:48:27,868 --> 01:48:30,598
It looks good.
We're just over budget on the amperage.

1517
01:48:30,704 --> 01:48:33,036
<i>- By how much?</i>
- Three or four amps.

1518
01:48:33,106 --> 01:48:35,234
God damn it, John! Is it three or four?

1519
01:48:35,408 --> 01:48:36,876
- Four.
- Four!

1520
01:48:38,545 --> 01:48:40,104
Four more amps.

1521
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:53,589
They have some power left
in the LEM batteries, right?

1522
01:48:53,727 --> 01:48:54,887
<i>Yeah.</i>

1523
01:48:56,196 --> 01:49:00,224
We have an umbilical that provides power
from the command module to the LEM.

1524
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:03,861
- It's backup for the LEM power supply.
- I'm listening.

1525
01:49:04,304 --> 01:49:08,935
So reverse it. Reverse the flow
and see if we can draw these four amps...

1526
01:49:09,009 --> 01:49:11,876
from the LEM before we cut it loose.
Why can't we do that?

1527
01:49:13,447 --> 01:49:17,042
- We don't have a procedure for that?
- You'll lose a lot in the transfer.

1528
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:20,609
Yeah. But all we're talking about here
is four amps.

1529
01:49:21,822 --> 01:49:24,484
I want whatever you guys got
on these power procedures.

1530
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:27,493
- Gene, they're already...
- Not all, just part.

1531
01:49:27,561 --> 01:49:30,496
- We've got to give them something.
- They're working on it.

1532
01:49:30,564 --> 01:49:32,657
- I'll get an estimate.
- God damn it!

1533
01:49:32,732 --> 01:49:36,965
I don't want another estimate!
I want the procedures now!

1534
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:50,815
IMU is up.

1535
01:49:52,085 --> 01:49:54,713
<i>- How am I reading?</i>
- Fine, so far.

1536
01:49:54,921 --> 01:49:57,515
<i>- Say again.</i>
- You're under the limit. Keep going.

1537
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:00,653
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1538
01:50:02,562 --> 01:50:05,088
<i>Okay, I'm bringing up the guidance.</i>

1539
01:50:07,834 --> 01:50:09,199
Here we go.

1540
01:50:10,737 --> 01:50:12,432
CMC Attitude IMU.

1541
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:15,040
<i>CMC source.</i>

1542
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:19,037
CMC mode, auto,
and we're on the computer.

1543
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:32,717
<i>- Go ahead.</i>
- Is your computer on now?

1544
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,257
Up and running.

1545
01:50:36,096 --> 01:50:37,563
How do we look?

1546
01:50:47,073 --> 01:50:49,133
I think we got it, buddy.

1547
01:50:59,286 --> 01:51:02,881
Arthur, my notes are clear
on that last sequence, right?

1548
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:06,217
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- I was getting a little blurry there.

1549
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:11,521
Here's Ken. Here's John.

1550
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:14,492
It's good to see you, Ken.

1551
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:16,164
This is the sequence.

1552
01:51:16,236 --> 01:51:19,467
- Was it tried on the hardware yet?
- We didn't have time.

1553
01:51:20,507 --> 01:51:22,839
Aquarius, Houston. Do you read?

1554
01:51:23,843 --> 01:51:25,835
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1555
01:51:27,914 --> 01:51:30,508
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?

1556
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:34,384
That's a negative, Jim.
I don't have the measles.

1557
01:51:39,059 --> 01:51:41,152
<i>Jim, is Jack in there with you?</i>

1558
01:51:41,561 --> 01:51:44,428
Yeah, stand by one.
We gotta get him on comm.

1559
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:47,432
- Put those on the table.
- Damn it. Thanks, Jackie.

1560
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:49,866
I think it would really help if you could...

1561
01:51:49,936 --> 01:51:54,339
just distract her
when the heavy predictions come in.

1562
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:57,503
- We'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

1563
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:03,275
Blanch, these nice, young men
are gonna watch television with you.

1564
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:07,013
- This is Neil Armstrong, and this is Buzz.
- Nice to meet you.

1565
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:11,182
- Hi.
- Are you boys in the space program, too?

1566
01:52:12,926 --> 01:52:16,521
Okay, Jack, give me a read-back
on that last procedure.

1567
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:18,354
Stand by, Ken.

1568
01:52:22,135 --> 01:52:26,368
Ken, I'm having trouble
reading my own writing.

1569
01:52:26,473 --> 01:52:29,772
I guess I was
a little more tired than I thought.

1570
01:52:34,814 --> 01:52:37,443
Don't worry, Jack. I'll talk you through it.

1571
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:43,019
Find the main bus breakers on panel 11.

1572
01:52:45,558 --> 01:52:47,390
Yeah, main bus breakers. Got it.

1573
01:52:47,627 --> 01:52:49,118
<i>Close main bus B.</i>

1574
01:52:57,303 --> 01:53:01,070
Ken, there's an awful lot of condensation
on these panels.

1575
01:53:01,408 --> 01:53:04,104
What's the word
on these things shorting out?

1576
01:53:08,448 --> 01:53:11,315
We'll just take that one at a time, Jack.

1577
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:17,416
It's like trying to drive a toaster
through a car wash.

1578
01:53:24,998 --> 01:53:26,898
<i>Main bus B is closed.</i>

1579
01:53:26,966 --> 01:53:29,561
13, <i>we're coming up on entry interface.</i>

1580
01:53:29,636 --> 01:53:33,265
Flight, we're still shallowing up a bit
in the re-entry corridor.

1581
01:53:33,339 --> 01:53:35,501
It's almost like they're underweight.

1582
01:53:35,642 --> 01:53:38,941
- Now how could they be underweight?
- We didn't land on the moon.

1583
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:42,614
- Rocks?
- That's affirm.

1584
01:53:43,616 --> 01:53:45,050
<i>One more thing, Jim.</i>

1585
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:48,087
<i>While Jack's working on the power-up,
we want you and Freddo...</i>

1586
01:53:48,154 --> 01:53:50,646
<i>to transfer some ballast
over to the command module.</i>

1587
01:53:50,757 --> 01:53:52,623
Say again, Houston. Ballast?

1588
01:53:53,259 --> 01:53:56,127
That's affirm. We got to get the weight right.

1589
01:53:56,196 --> 01:53:59,825
We were expecting you to be toting
a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.

1590
01:53:59,933 --> 01:54:01,264
Right, Houston.

1591
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,830
<i>- Now, Jack.</i>
- Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

1592
01:54:03,937 --> 01:54:06,201
<i>Okay, now, panel five.</i>

1593
01:54:06,873 --> 01:54:11,674
<i>Circuit breaker caution
and warning main B closed.</i>

1594
01:54:12,011 --> 01:54:13,707
Main B closed.

1595
01:54:15,215 --> 01:54:16,910
Master alarm off.

1596
01:54:17,117 --> 01:54:21,213
Okay, Jack, on panel seven,
b-mag number two, power to warm-up.

1597
01:54:21,454 --> 01:54:24,048
B-mag number two,
power to warm-up. Done.

1598
01:54:24,390 --> 01:54:26,791
<i>Sequential logic one and two on.</i>

1599
01:54:27,093 --> 01:54:29,960
Sequential logic, two on.

1600
01:54:30,263 --> 01:54:32,630
<i>CMRCS pressure, on.</i>

1601
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:34,963
CMRCS pressurization.

1602
01:54:35,068 --> 01:54:38,561
As her husband prepares
to jettison his lunar module lifeboat...

1603
01:54:38,638 --> 01:54:41,471
Marilyn Lovell waits
with her children, her neighbors...

1604
01:54:41,574 --> 01:54:46,034
and, we are told, <i>Apollo 11</i> astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

1605
01:54:46,412 --> 01:54:49,211
Only the Lovells' eldest son,
Jay, is absent...

1606
01:54:49,315 --> 01:54:51,477
as he holds vigil with his classmates...

1607
01:54:51,584 --> 01:54:54,747
at the St. John's Military Academy
in Wisconsin.

Okay, the IMU is up.

1617

- We got our eight-balls back.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1618
01:55:22,048 --> 01:55:26,747
Okay, Ken, uplink telemetry,
command module to accept, right?

1619
01:55:27,353 --> 01:55:29,879
That's affirm. Go ahead and try it.

Uplink completed.

- That's more like it.
- Okay, let's go.

1622
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,950
Take a look at your amps. How we doing?

1623
01:56:05,925 --> 01:56:07,825
We got her back up, Ken.

1624

Boy, I wish you were here to see it.

1625
01:56:10,363 --> 01:56:12,024
I'll bet you do.

1626
01:56:15,268 --> 01:56:16,929
Way to go, Jack.

1627
01:56:22,008 --> 01:56:24,101
- Flight, this is RETRO.
<i>- Go, RETRO.</i>

1628
01:56:24,444 --> 01:56:26,935
Flight, we have a typhoon warning...

1629
01:56:27,046 --> 01:56:30,141
<i>- on the edge of the prime recovery zone.</i>
- Say again, RETRO.

1630
01:56:30,216 --> 01:56:32,514
<i>We're looking at a typhoon warning...</i>

1631
01:56:32,585 --> 01:56:34,383
on the edge of the prime recovery area.

1632
01:56:34,454 --> 01:56:37,116
This is just a warning. It could miss them.

1633
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:39,352
Only if their luck changes.

1634
01:56:39,559 --> 01:56:42,051
Jim, we're ready for SM jettison!

1635
01:56:42,862 --> 01:56:44,990
All right, Jack, on three!

1636
01:56:46,299 --> 01:56:48,199
One, two...

1637
01:56:48,968 --> 01:56:51,665
- Upward thrust.
- We're loose!

1638
01:56:52,505 --> 01:56:54,166
Reverse thrust!

1639
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:56,739
We have service module jettison.

1640
01:56:56,809 --> 01:56:59,506
<i>Okay, Houston, service module is free.</i>

1641
01:56:59,879 --> 01:57:02,041
<i>We'll take a look at what we have here.</i>

1642
01:57:02,248 --> 01:57:03,613
<i>Copy that.</i>

1643
01:57:07,787 --> 01:57:09,721
There it is. I see it!

1644
01:57:13,393 --> 01:57:16,624
Houston, we're getting our first look
at the service module now.

1645
01:57:16,729 --> 01:57:19,460
One whole side of the spacecraft is missing.

1646

<i>Right by the high gain antenna
a whole panel is blown out...</i>

1647

<i>right up to our heat shield.</i>

1648
01:57:29,442 --> 01:57:31,274
Copy that, Aquarius.

1649
01:57:31,344 --> 01:57:34,837
It looked like it got the engine bell, too.
Can you see that?

1650
01:57:38,751 --> 01:57:40,913
Oh, man, that's incredible.

1651
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:45,519
The heat shield.

1652
01:57:45,625 --> 01:57:50,256
<i>The heat will build up to as
much as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

1653
01:57:51,597 --> 01:57:53,589
<i>On a lunar re-entry flight, the heat...</i>

1654
01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:55,134
So, Blanch?

1655
01:57:57,036 --> 01:57:59,801
Did Jim make Eagle Scout or not?

1656
01:57:59,973 --> 01:58:01,702
- Yes, he did.
- He did.

1657
01:58:01,774 --> 01:58:03,970
<i>If the heat shield
is even slightly cracked...</i>

1658
01:58:04,043 --> 01:58:06,706
<i>the extreme cold could've split it wide open.</i>

1659
01:58:07,013 --> 01:58:10,176
<i>Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics
that control the parachutes...</i>

1660
01:58:10,249 --> 01:58:13,014
<i>have been damaged,
the chutes may not open at all...</i>

1661
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:16,953
<i>causing the spacecraft to hit the water
not at a gentle 20 miles per hour...</i>

1662
01:58:17,223 --> 01:58:19,123
<i>but at a suicidal 300.</i>

1663
01:58:19,559 --> 01:58:21,459
<i>Perhaps never
in human history...</i>

1664
01:58:21,561 --> 01:58:25,054
<i>has the entire world been united
by such a global drama.</i>

1665
01:58:25,198 --> 01:58:27,792
<i>In New York City,
thousands of people have gathered...</i>

1666
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:30,563
<i>to watch updates of the mission
in Times Square.</i>

1667
01:58:30,636 --> 01:58:33,606
<i>Many countries offered help
and the State Department said...</i>

1668
01:58:33,706 --> 01:58:35,640
<i>it would ask for it if it were needed.</i>

1669
01:58:35,742 --> 01:58:39,041
<i>The House and Senate passed resolutions
calling on the people...</i>

1670
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:41,205
<i>to pray tonight for the astronauts.</i>

1671
01:58:41,314 --> 01:58:42,907
<i>In Rome, Pope Paul led...</i>

1672
01:58:43,316 --> 01:58:47,082
<i>50,000 people in prayers
for the safe return of the astronauts.</i>

1673
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:50,050
<i>In Jerusalem, prayers at the Wailing Wall...</i>

1674
01:58:55,895 --> 01:58:58,796
It's about time to bail out of this ship.

1675
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,470
You okay?

1676
01:59:09,208 --> 01:59:10,699
I'm freezing.

1677
01:59:13,212 --> 01:59:15,841
Can you hold out just a little longer?

1678
01:59:16,282 --> 01:59:18,512
- Long as I have to.
- Come on.

1679
01:59:19,452 --> 01:59:22,854
It won't be long. Just a little while longer.

1680
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:30,225
Just a little while longer. We're gonna hit
that water in the South Pacific.

1681
01:59:31,063 --> 01:59:32,861
Open up that hatch.

1682
01:59:34,133 --> 01:59:37,000
- It's 80 degrees out there.
- 80 degrees.

1683
01:59:39,906 --> 01:59:43,308
- You are a mess.
- Yeah.

1684
01:59:45,344 --> 01:59:48,041
<i>Odyssey, Houston.
How we doing, guys?</i>

1685
01:59:48,147 --> 01:59:50,377
<i>We're closing in on lunar module jettison.</i>

1686
01:59:50,483 --> 01:59:52,679
<i>As you know, that is time critical.</i>

1687
01:59:52,752 --> 01:59:55,346
<i>You should be moving
into the command module.</i>

1688
01:59:55,421 --> 01:59:57,048
<i>Let's get that hatch buttoned up...</i>

1689
01:59:57,156 --> 01:59:59,921
<i>and when you get a chance,
let us know how you're doing.</i>

1690
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:01,559
Roger that.

1691
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:07,030
Let me give you a hand there, Freddo.

1692
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:44,602
<i>We're coming up on LEM jettison.</i>

1693
02:00:44,937 --> 02:00:47,702
Is everyone strapped in, Ken?
We're getting real close.

1694
02:00:47,773 --> 02:00:52,074
Copy that, Flight. <i>13,</i> Houston.
We're coming up on LEM jettison.

1695
02:00:52,578 --> 02:00:53,909
Stand by.

1696
02:00:55,281 --> 02:00:57,306
<i>Have you got everybody in the Odyssey?</i>

1697
02:00:57,416 --> 02:01:00,716
Yeah, Ken, I'm gonna check
those pyro batteries one more time here.

1698
02:01:02,221 --> 02:01:06,522
The pyro batts look good. I don't think
we have to tie the other batteries.

1699
02:01:19,071 --> 02:01:21,472
Sorry, Jack, this is an old habit.

1700
02:01:21,541 --> 02:01:24,840
I'm kind of used to the pilot's seat.
She's yours to fly.

1701
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:33,675
<i>Odyssey, I want to double check
some re-entry procedures...</i>

1702
02:01:33,753 --> 02:01:37,655
<i>right after we jettison the LEM,
which is coming up in 30 seconds.</i>

1703
02:01:38,558 --> 02:01:40,048
What is that?

1704
02:01:41,594 --> 02:01:43,187
I was getting a little punchy...

1705
02:01:43,262 --> 02:01:46,994
and I didn't want to cut the LEM loose
with you guys still in it.

1706
02:01:48,234 --> 02:01:50,100
That's good thinking.

1707
02:01:52,171 --> 02:01:53,901
Stand by, Houston.

1708
02:01:56,576 --> 02:01:58,908
<i>We have lunar module jettison.</i>

1709
02:02:06,786 --> 02:02:08,845
She sure was a good ship.

1710
02:02:10,289 --> 02:02:13,486
<i>Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.</i>

1711
02:02:24,103 --> 02:02:26,128
It's almost time, honey.

1712
02:02:29,609 --> 02:02:31,702
Flight 966406.

1713
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:53,889
Let me put it this way.

1714
02:02:53,966 --> 02:02:56,799
The trajectory may be off.
Their thrusters may be frozen.

1715
02:02:56,869 --> 02:02:59,031
Their guidance system
might be malfunctioning.

1716
02:02:59,138 --> 02:03:00,867
Their heat shield could be cracked.

1717
02:03:00,973 --> 02:03:03,966
And their parachutes
might be three blocks of ice.

1718
02:03:04,076 --> 02:03:06,102
Clearly, we have
some obstacles to overcome.

1719
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:09,272
But now I'm asking you,
when will we know?

1720
02:03:10,349 --> 02:03:15,048
Blackout lasts for three minutes.
If they're not back in four, we'll know.

1721
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:20,089
Velocity now reading 34,802 feet per second.

1722
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:23,423
- Range to go 2,625 nautical miles.
- Copy that.

1723
02:03:24,163 --> 02:03:28,964
Okay, Ken, we are aligned for re-entry. Jim,
we need that computer re-entry program.

1724
02:03:29,068 --> 02:03:31,935
- Fred, how are the batteries looking?
- Okay.

1725
02:03:32,805 --> 02:03:35,934
- Batt A looks good.
<i>- Re-entry interface in one minute...</i>

1726
02:03:36,008 --> 02:03:39,638
- Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay.
<i>- ...and 30 seconds.</i>

1727
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:42,111
Batt C...

1728
02:03:43,149 --> 02:03:45,174
No volts, only two amps.

1729
02:03:46,419 --> 02:03:48,979
It may die before the main chutes open.

1730
02:03:49,288 --> 02:03:52,189
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries
onto main A and main B.

1731
02:03:52,291 --> 02:03:55,818
They're still shallowing a bit up there.
Do you want to tell them?

1732
02:03:56,595 --> 02:03:59,360
- Is there anything we can do about it?
<i>- Not now, Flight.</i>

1733
02:03:59,465 --> 02:04:02,093
- Then they don't need to know, do they?
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1734
02:04:02,201 --> 02:04:05,762
RETRO says the typhoon
is still a presence in the splashdown area?

1735
02:04:05,871 --> 02:04:08,739
We got the parachute situation...

1736
02:04:08,841 --> 02:04:11,333
heat shield, angle of trajectory,
and a typhoon.

1737
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:15,245
- There are so many variables, I'm at a loss...
- I know what the problems are.

1738
02:04:15,414 --> 02:04:18,407
This could be the worst disaster
NASA has experienced.

1739
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:23,114
With all due respect, sir,
I believe this is going to be our finest hour.

1740
02:04:36,068 --> 02:04:38,696
Expect entry interface in 45 seconds.

1741
02:04:39,605 --> 02:04:41,733
And on my mark, your velocity...

1742
02:04:41,807 --> 02:04:45,039
<i>will be 35,245 feet per second.</i>

1743
02:04:46,545 --> 02:04:49,447
<i>Mark 35 seconds to entry interface.</i>

1744
02:04:52,251 --> 02:04:53,719
Gentlemen...

1745
02:04:56,322 --> 02:04:59,052
it's been a privilege flying with you.

1746
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:44,536
- Flight, we have loss of radio contact.
- Roger that.

1747
02:05:44,603 --> 02:05:47,095
Expect to regain signal in three minutes.

1748
02:05:50,776 --> 02:05:52,574
It all depends on the heat shield.

1749
02:06:25,878 --> 02:06:28,506
<i>Back to the</i> Iwo Jima
<i>and our live cameras there.</i>

1750
02:06:28,948 --> 02:06:32,315
<i>The Navy recovery and rescue helicopters
already airborne...</i>

1751
02:06:32,384 --> 02:06:35,217
<i>circling, waiting for first radar contact.</i>

1752
02:06:35,321 --> 02:06:38,017
<i>Three minutes until time
of drogue deployment.</i>

1753
02:06:39,191 --> 02:06:42,525
<i>Standing by for any reports of acquisition.</i>

1754
02:06:47,566 --> 02:06:50,661
One minute and 30 seconds
to end of blackout.

1755
02:06:55,975 --> 02:06:58,569
<i>No re-entering ship
has ever taken longer...</i>

1756
02:06:58,677 --> 02:07:01,579
<i>than three minutes to emerge from blackout.</i>

1757
02:07:01,647 --> 02:07:05,049
<i>This is the critical moment.
Will the heat shield hold?</i>

1758
02:07:05,484 --> 02:07:09,421
<i>Will the command module survive
the intense heat of re-entry?</i>

1759
02:07:09,755 --> 02:07:12,417
<i>If it doesn't, there'll only be silence.</i>

1760
02:07:12,558 --> 02:07:15,618
- Mommy, you're squishing me.
- Sorry, sweetie.

1761
02:07:16,161 --> 02:07:17,254
It's okay.

1762
02:07:33,612 --> 02:07:35,774
Okay, Flight, that's three minutes.

1763
02:07:35,848 --> 02:07:39,113
- We are standing by for acquisition.
- Copy that.

1764
02:07:40,786 --> 02:07:43,278
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?

1765
02:07:46,225 --> 02:07:48,455
<i>Expected time of reacquisition...</i>

1766
02:07:48,527 --> 02:07:52,054
<i>the time when the astronauts
were expected to come out of blackout...</i>

1767
02:07:52,498 --> 02:07:55,160
<i>has come and gone.</i>

1768
02:07:56,235 --> 02:07:59,796
<i>About all any of us can do now
is just listen and hope.</i>

1769
02:07:59,872 --> 02:08:02,705
<i>We're about to learn whether
or not that heat shield...</i>

1770
02:08:02,775 --> 02:08:06,040
<i>which was damaged
by the explosion three days ago...</i>

1771
02:08:06,278 --> 02:08:09,043
<i>has withstood the inferno of re-entry.</i>

1772
02:08:13,152 --> 02:08:16,087
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1773
02:08:22,328 --> 02:08:24,922
Three minutes, 30 seconds.
Standing by.

1774
02:08:25,564 --> 02:08:27,897
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1775
02:08:35,774 --> 02:08:38,642
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1776
02:08:42,948 --> 02:08:45,576
That's four minutes. Standing by.

1777
02:09:07,773 --> 02:09:09,969
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1778
02:09:18,417 --> 02:09:20,818
<i>Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.</i>

1779
02:09:20,953 --> 02:09:22,785
<i>It's good to see you again.</i>

1780
02:09:46,545 --> 02:09:48,877
Odyssey, Houston. Welcome home.

1781
02:09:49,214 --> 02:09:51,149
We're glad to see you.

1782
02:09:51,784 --> 02:09:53,877
- Good job, Ken.
- Thank you.

1783
02:10:38,564 --> 02:10:40,054
They made it!

1784
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:26,171
Houston, we're at stable one.
The ship is secure.

1785
02:11:26,979 --> 02:11:29,311
This is <i>Apollo 13</i> signing off.

1786
02:11:29,648 --> 02:11:30,979
Good job.

1787
02:12:22,834 --> 02:12:25,463
<i>Our mission
was called a successful failure...</i>

1788
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:28,802
<i>in that we returned safely,
but never made it to the moon.</i>

1789
02:12:29,308 --> 02:12:31,606
<i>In the following months it was determined...</i>

1790
02:12:31,677 --> 02:12:34,737
<i>that a damaged coil
built inside the oxygen tank...</i>

1791
02:12:34,947 --> 02:12:39,543
<i>sparked during our cryo stir and caused
the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.</i>

1792
02:12:39,952 --> 02:12:42,284
<i>It was a minor defect
that occurred two years...</i>

1793
02:12:42,387 --> 02:12:44,788
<i>before I was even named
the flight's commander.</i>

1794
02:12:45,357 --> 02:12:48,759
<i>Fred Haise was going back
to the moon on</i> Apollo 18...

1795
02:12:48,827 --> 02:12:51,160
<i>but his mission was cancelled
due to budget cuts.</i>

1796
02:12:51,263 --> 02:12:53,254
<i>He never flew in space again.</i>

1797
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:56,363
<i>Nor did Jack Swigert,
who left the Astronaut Corps...</i>

1798
02:12:56,468 --> 02:12:59,529
<i>and was elected to Congress
from the state of Colorado.</i>

1799
02:12:59,705 --> 02:13:02,606
<i>But he died of cancer
before he was able to take office.</i>

1800
02:13:04,076 --> 02:13:07,944
<i>Ken Mattingly orbited the moon
as command module pilot of</i> Apollo 16...

1801
02:13:08,046 --> 02:13:11,847
<i>and flew the Space Shuttle,
having never gotten the measles.</i>

1802
02:13:12,517 --> 02:13:16,955
<i>Gene Kranz retired as Director
of Flight Operations just not long ago.</i>

1803
02:13:17,256 --> 02:13:20,419
<i>Many members of Mission Control
have gone on to other things...</i>

1804
02:13:20,525 --> 02:13:22,585
<i>but some are still there.</i>

1805
02:13:23,428 --> 02:13:24,896
<i>And as for me...</i>

1806
02:13:25,264 --> 02:13:29,394
<i>the seven extraordinary days of</i> Apollo 13
<i>were my last in space.</i>

1807
02:13:30,402 --> 02:13:34,396
<i>I watched other men walk on the moon
and return safely...</i>

1808
02:13:34,873 --> 02:13:39,106
<i>all from the confines of Mission Control
and our house in Houston.</i>

1809
02:13:40,245 --> 02:13:42,942
<i>I sometimes catch myself
looking up at the moon...</i>

1810
02:13:43,048 --> 02:13:46,484
<i>remembering the changes
of fortune in our long voyage...</i>

1811
02:13:46,752 --> 02:13:50,814
<i>thinking of the thousands of people
who worked to bring the three of us home.</i>

1812
02:13:52,024 --> 02:13:54,618
<i>I look up at the moon and wonder...</i>

1813
02:13:55,294 --> 02:13:56,989
<i>when will we be going back...</i>

1814
02:13:57,863 --> 02:13:59,421
<i>and who will that be?</i>
