1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,563
This story is about Howard Beale,
the " Network News" anchorman on UBS TV.

2
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:23,537
ln his time, Howard Beale had been
a mandarin of television...

3
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:25,539
the grand old man of news...

4
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:29,168
with a HUT rating of 16
and a 28 audience share.

5
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:32,941
ln 1969, however, his fortunes
began to decline.

6
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:35,006
He fell to a 22 share.

7
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,348
The following year, his wife died,
and he was left a childless widower...

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,980
with an 8 rating
and a 12 share.

9
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:44,787
He became morose and isolated,
began to drink heavily.

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,387
On September 22, 1975,
he was fired...

11
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:50,397
effective in two weeks.

12
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:52,990
The news was broken to him
by Max Schumacher...

13
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:56,003
who was the president
of the News Division at UBS.

14
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,835
The two old friends
got properly pissed.

15
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:03,844
l was at CBS
with Ed Murrow in 1951.

16
00:01:03,912 --> 00:01:05,971
Must've been 1950.

17
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:09,913
l was at NBC.
Associate producer.

18
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:14,319
Morning news.
l was just a kid-- 26 years old.

19
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:22,255
Anyway, they were building the lower
level of the George Washington Bridge.

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,163
We were doing a remote from there.

21
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:31,436
And nobody told me.

22
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:35,676
7:00 a.m., l get a call.

23
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,339
"Where are you? You're supposed to be
on the George Washington Bridge?"

24
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,875
l jump out of bed,
throw my raincoat over my pajamas.

25
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:47,513
l run downstairs
and out into the street...

26
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:50,319
hail a cab and say to the cabbie...

27
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:53,452
"Take me to the middle
of the George Washington Bridge."

28
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:58,658
The cabbie turns around and says--

29
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:02,366
He says, " Don't do it, buddy.

30
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:08,136
You're a young man. You've got
your whole life ahead of you."

31
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:15,582
Didn't l tell you that before?

32
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:23,750
l'm gonna kill myself.

33
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:26,017
Shit, Howard.

34
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:30,391
l'm gonna blow my brains out
right on the air...

35
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,930
right in the middle
of the seven o'clock news.

36
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,701
You'll get a hell of a rating,
l'll guarantee that.

37
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:40,435
Fifty share easy.

38
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:43,501
- You think so?
- Sure.

39
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:47,207
We could make a series out of it.
"Suicide of the Week."

40
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:53,678
Why limit ourselves?
"Execution of the Week."

41
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:56,683
"Terrorist of the Week."

42
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,726
They'll love it.

43
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:03,089
Suicides. Assassinations.

44
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,590
Mad bombers.

45
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:09,102
Mafia hit men.

46
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:11,105
Automobile smashups.

47
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:13,266
"The Death Hour."

48
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:19,311
"A great Sunday night show
for the whole family."

49
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:24,107
lt'd put fucking Disney
right off the air.

50
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:01,818
Let's do the Lenin deportation
at the end of three.

51
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,881
- Strong enough to bump?
- At one, then.

52
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,360
l'll do a lead on Sarah Jane Moore
to May Berry in San Francisco.

53
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:09,329
The film l saw
was of the chief of detectives.

54
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:14,391
l think we've got ten seconds
on the shooting itself.

55
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,131
The whole thing is 1:25.

56
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:20,470
- What does that come out?
- About 4:50.

57
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:24,768
- Can we use Squeaky Fromme?
- Let's do that at two.

58
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:29,249
Squeaky boarded the airport bus.

59
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:31,547
You using a map on him
for San Francisco?

60
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,817
l'd prefer newspapers.

61
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,358
What've we got left?

62
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:40,519
Gun control.
Patty Hearst affidavit.

63
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:43,564
Guerillas in Chad.
OPEC in Guiana.

64
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:11,682
Hello, Howard.
How are you?

65
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:24,731
Don't forget, Howard,
we're not using the 16.

66
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:33,205
The first attempt on President Ford's
life was 18 days ago...

67
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,943
and again yesterday in San Francisco.

68
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,281
ln spite of the two attempts,
Mr. Ford says...

69
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:41,049
he will not become a prisoner
of the Oval Office...

70
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:44,285
a hostage
of would-be assassins.

71
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:48,295
The American people
are good people.

72
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:52,026
Democrats, lndependents,
Republicans and others.

73
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,263
- How do you get mixed up that type?
- l don't know.

74
00:05:56,771 --> 00:06:01,140
lf you're so hot, why go to strangers?
What's wrong with me?

75
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:06,980
Ready two.

76
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:10,580
Two. Cue Howard.

77
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:13,052
Ladies and gentlemen,
l would like at this moment...

78
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:17,319
to announce that l will be retiring
from this program in two weeks' time...

79
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:19,223
because of poor ratings.

80
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:24,163
Since this show is the only thing
l had going for me in my life...

81
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:26,928
l have decided to kill myself.

82
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:32,497
l'm going to blow my brains out
on this program a week from today.

83
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,337
Ten seconds to commercial.

84
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,070
Tune in next Tuesday.

85
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:39,910
That should give the public relations
people a week to promote the show.

86
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,915
We oughta get a hell of a rating
out of that.

87
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:44,943
Fifty share easy.

88
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:51,282
- Listen. Did you hear that?
- What was that about?

89
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,658
Howard said he was going
to blow his brains out next Tuesday.

90
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,529
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you hear him?

91
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:02,297
Howard said he was going
to kill himself next Tuesday.

92
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:07,241
What do you mean Howard said he
was going to kill himself next Tuesday?

93
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,333
He was supposed to do a tag.

94
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:13,177
He said, " Tune in next Tuesday.
l'm going to shoot myself."

95
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:14,681
What's going on?

96
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:17,479
He just said he was going
to blow his brains out.

97
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:19,520
What the fuck's going on?

98
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:22,556
- They wanna know what's going on.
- l can't hear you.

99
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:25,616
- Turn the studio mike on.
- We're on in 11 seconds.

100
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:28,821
- Ten seconds.
- What are you doing? Have you flipped?

101
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:31,559
- We better get him off.
- Get him off.

102
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,397
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Turn the sound off!

103
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:36,494
He's going on live!

104
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:38,835
- Key two.
- We're in trouble down here.

105
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:44,074
Go to standby!

106
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:50,206
Lou, can't we clear out the lobby?
There must be 100 people there.

107
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:52,753
- How am l gonna clear 'em out?
- Every TV station and wire service!

108
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:55,187
l could barely get in.

109
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:59,056
- Arthur, anything?
- Not so far.

110
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:02,187
Frank Hackett just walked in.
We had to abort the show.

111
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:04,493
So far over 900
fucking phone calls...

112
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:07,228
complaining about the foul language.

113
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:10,271
- What page are you putting it on?
- Hackett just walked in.

114
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:13,102
- ABC again.
- Tell 'em to go fuck themselves.

115
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,869
That goes for you, too, Marty.

116
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:16,604
You're off the air.

117
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:20,011
- He wants to talk to you.
- Who's replacing Beale?

118
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,948
- We're flying Snowden up.
- Everybody hold it.

119
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:25,349
Let's see how the other networks
handle this.

120
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,322
- The ten o'clock news opened with it.
- Good evening. Howard Beale--

121
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,415
They'll all make it
their lead story.

122
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:34,826
Howard Beale interrupted
his " Network News" program tonight...

123
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:37,091
to announce he was going
to kill himself.

124
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,463
An unusual thing happened
at a sister network...

125
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:41,764
UBS, this evening.

126
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:45,363
- How are we handling it?
- Halloway will make a statement...

127
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,809
at the end of the show that Howard's
been under great personal stress.

128
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,879
We've got a stockholders' meeting
tomorrow...

129
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:57,247
at which we will announce
the restructuring of management plan.

130
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:00,515
l don't want this grotesque incident
to interfere with that.

131
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:04,524
l'll suggest Mr. Ruddy open with a short
statement washing this whole thing off.

132
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:09,325
You, Max, better have answers for those
nuts that always come to the meetings.

133
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:11,831
Mr. Beale has been under great
professional and personal strain.

134
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,891
l've got surprises for you, too!

135
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:16,300
l've had it up to here
with your division...

136
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:19,067
and it's annual
$33 million deficit!

137
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,768
Keep your hands off
my News Division, Frank.

138
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:24,573
We're responsible to corporate level,
not you.

139
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:26,910
We'll goddamn well see about that.

140
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:30,439
All right, take it easy.
How do we get Beale out of here?

141
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:34,614
l understand there are reporters
and camera crews in the lobby.

142
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,623
We've got a limo at the freight exit.

143
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:40,991
Howard, you'll spend the night at my
place. There'll be press around yours.

144
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,871
l want Snowden here by noon...

145
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:55,068
have Lester
cover the ClA hearings...

146
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:57,373
and give the White House
to Doris.

147
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:59,777
You're late for your screening, Max.

148
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,149
Right. Okay.

149
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:08,446
lf John Wheeler calls,
switch him to projection room 7.

150
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,189
- l'm sorry, Bill. This Beale business.
- lt's all right. Sit down.

151
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:16,526
Diana asked if she could sit in on this.

152
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:19,158
Fine. How's it going?

153
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:22,897
You'll like this footage better than
the stuff l showed you last time.

154
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,673
Max Schumacher.

155
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,336
Goddamn it! When?

156
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,939
Did he say anything?

157
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:38,609
All right, thank you.

158
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:44,619
The Communist Party believes the most
pressing political necessity today...

159
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:47,957
is the consolidation
of the revolutionary...

160
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:50,088
radical and democratic movements--

161
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:54,833
Harry, Howard Beale left my house
20 minutes ago.

162
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:56,870
Has he come in yet?

163
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:58,872
Let me know when he arrives.

164
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,340
- That's Laureen Hobbs, isn't it?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:05,709
This is from a David Susskind thing
a while back.

166
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,408
l think we can use some of this stuff.

167
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:14,083
What we're going to see now
is something really sensational.

168
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:17,647
The Flagstaff lndependent Bank
of Arizona was ripped off last week...

169
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,922
by a terrorist group called
the Ecumenical Liberation Army.

170
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:25,295
They themselves took movies of the
rip-off while they were ripping it off.

171
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:29,234
The Ecumenical Liberation Army is not
the one that kidnapped Patty Hearst?

172
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:31,772
No, that's the Symbionese
Liberation Army.

173
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,137
This is the Ecumenical
Liberation Army.

174
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,439
They're the ones who kidnapped
Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago.

175
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:40,709
There's a lot of liberation armies
in the revolutionary underground...

176
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,716
and a lot of kidnapped heiresses.

177
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,718
This is Mary Ann Gifford.

178
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:50,756
That's the Great Ahmed Khan.
He's their leader.

179
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:56,252
They actually shot this film
while they were ripping off the bank?

180
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:58,390
Wait till you see it.

181
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,333
l don't know whether to edit
or leave it raw like this.

182
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:06,398
This is terrific stuff!
Where did you get it?

183
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:08,305
l got everything
through Laureen Hobbs.

184
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:11,209
She's my contact
for all this stuff.

185
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:21,013
- l've got Howard on the other line.
- Put him on.

186
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:23,819
l've got Max on four. Pick up.

187
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,484
l'd like another shot.

188
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:31,293
- Come on, Howard.
- l don't mean the whole show.

189
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:35,166
l'd like to come on,
make some brief farewell statement...

190
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:38,296
and then turn the show over
to Jack Snowden.

191
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:42,366
l have 11 years at this network.
l have some standing in the industry.

192
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:45,003
l just don't want to go out
like a clown.

193
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,209
lt'll be simple, dignified.
You and Harry can check the copy.

194
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:51,683
l think it'll take the strain
off the show.

195
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:57,519
- What do you think?
- Well, okay.

196
00:12:57,592 --> 00:13:00,891
And no booze today, Howard!

197
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,395
No booze.

198
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:11,832
George, can you come into my office
for a minute?

199
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:22,072
Barbara, is Tommy around?
l'd like to see the two of you.

200
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:33,758
This is Bill Herron from our West Coast
Special Programs Department.

201
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:36,888
George Bosch. Barbara Schlesinger.
Tommy Pellegrino.

202
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:40,957
l just saw footage of a special Bill's
doing on the revolutionary underground.

203
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:43,663
Most of it's tedious stuff of
Laureen Hobbs and two fatigue jackets...

204
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:46,138
muttering mutilated Marxism...

205
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:50,337
but he's got eight minutes
of a bank robbery...

206
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:52,436
that is sensational!

207
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:56,609
Authentic stuff shot
while the robbery was going on.

208
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:59,016
Remember the Mary Ann Gifford
kidnapping?

209
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:02,920
lt's that bunch of nuts. She's in
the movie shooting off machine guns.

210
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,288
This is really terrific footage.

211
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:08,886
We can get a movie of the week
out of it, maybe even a series.

212
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:12,399
A series?
What are we talking about?

213
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:16,995
We've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals,
the Ecumenical Liberation Army...

214
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:20,234
who go around taking home movies
of themselves robbing banks.

215
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:23,800
Maybe they'll take movies of themselves
kidnapping heiresses...

216
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,812
hijacking 7 47 s...

217
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,041
bombing bridges,
assassinating ambassadors.

218
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:33,153
We'd open each week's segment
with their authentic footage...

219
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:36,816
hire writers to write a story behind
that footage, and we've got a series.

220
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:41,819
A series about a bunch
of bank-robbing guerrillas?

221
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:45,931
What will we call it,
the " Mao Tse-Tung Hour" ?

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,558
Why not?

223
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,899
They've got " Strike Force,"
"Task Force," " SWAT."

224
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:53,099
Why not Che Guevara
and his own little " Mod Squad" ?

225
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:57,736
l sent you all a concept analysis report
yesterday. Did any of you read it?

226
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:01,876
Well, in a nutshell it said...

227
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:03,974
"The American people
are turning sullen."

228
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:07,817
They've been clobbered on all sides
by Vietnam, Watergate, inflation.

229
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:11,120
They've turned off, shot up, fucked
themselves limp, and nothing helps.

230
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:14,753
So this concept analysis report
concludes...

231
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:19,562
the American people want somebody
to articulate their rage for them.

232
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:25,038
l've told you since l took this job
six months ago that l want angry shows.

233
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:27,267
l don't want conventional programming.

234
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:30,003
l want counterculture.
l want antiestablishment.

235
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:37,050
l don't want to play butch boss
with you people...

236
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:39,177
but when l took over
this department...

237
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:41,847
it had the worst programming record
in television history.

238
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,721
This network hasn't one show
in the top 20.

239
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,851
This network is an industry joke.

240
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:50,227
We better start putting together
one winner for next September.

241
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:52,232
l want a show developed...

242
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,895
based on the activities
of a terrorist group.

243
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,370
"Joseph Stalin and His Merry Band
of Bolsheviks."

244
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:01,806
l want ideas from you.
That is what you're paid for.

245
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:05,642
By the way, the next time l send
an audience research report around...

246
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:08,147
you'd better read it,
or l'll sack the lot of you.

247
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:09,842
ls that clear?

248
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:15,583
l'll be on the coast in four weeks. Can
you set up a meeting with Laureen Hobbs?

249
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:19,251
The business of management
is management.

250
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:22,694
At the time CCA took control,
the UBS TV network was foundering...

251
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:26,290
with less than seven percent
of national television revenues...

252
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,234
most network programs being sold
at station rates.

253
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:32,898
l am pleased to announce l am submitting
to the board of directors a plan...

254
00:16:32,974 --> 00:16:35,704
for the coordination
of the main profit centers...

255
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,745
and with the specific intention
of making each division...

256
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:41,611
more responsive to management.

257
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:43,115
Point one.

258
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:48,010
"The division producing the lowest rate
of return has been the News Division...

259
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:53,652
with its $98 million budget and its
average annual deficit of $32 million."

260
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:58,162
l know, historically, news divisions
are expected to lose money.

261
00:16:58,232 --> 00:17:01,065
To our minds, this philosophy
is a wanton fiscal affront...

262
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:04,832
to be resolutely resisted.

263
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:10,366
The new plan calls for local news to be
transferred to Owned Stations Divisions.

264
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:13,971
News Radio would be transferred to
the UBS Radio Division...

265
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:18,109
and the News Division would be reduced
from an independent division...

266
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:22,713
to a department accountable
to network.

267
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:31,086
- What was that all about, Ed?
- This is not the time.

268
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,099
Why wasn't l told about this?

269
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:37,467
Why was l led up onto that podium and
humiliated in front of the stockholders?

270
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:39,972
Goddamn it! l spoke to John Wheeler
this morning...

271
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,669
and he assured me
that the News Division was safe.

272
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:44,973
lf you want me to resign,
that's a bad way to do it.

273
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:47,947
We'll talk about this tomorrow
at our regular morning meeting.

274
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:02,029
Roll VTA.

275
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:04,326
Bring it up on one.
Ready now.

276
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:09,158
ln five, four, three, two--

277
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,431
- One.
- One TVA.

278
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:14,306
And...

279
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:17,576
cue announcer.

280
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:19,613
The " UBS Evening News" ...

281
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:22,840
with Howard Beale.

282
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:24,817
Ready two.

283
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:26,409
Two. Cue power.

284
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:30,514
Good evening.
Today is Wednesday, September 24...

285
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:32,525
and this is my last broadcast.

286
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:35,895
Yesterday l announced
on this program...

287
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:38,932
that l was going to commit
public suicide...

288
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:41,559
admittedly an act of madness.

289
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:44,729
l'll tell you what happened.
l just ran out of bullshit.

290
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:47,103
- Cut him off.
- Leave him on.

291
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:49,975
Am l still on?

292
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:53,138
lf this is how he wants to go out,
this is how he goes out.

293
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:55,478
l just ran out of bullshit.

294
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:58,017
Mr. Schumacher's here.
Do you want to talk to him?

295
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:00,019
Bullshit is all the reasons
we give for living.

296
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:04,387
lf we can't think up reasons of our own,
we always have the God bullshit.

297
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,323
- We don't know why we go through...
- What is it?

298
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:08,861
pointless pain,
humiliation and decay.

299
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,865
There better be someone, somewhere
who does know. That's the God bullshit.

300
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:16,369
He's saying that life is bullshit.
lt is. What are you screaming about?

301
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:19,873
Man is a noble creature who can order
his own world. Who needs God?

302
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:24,943
lf there's anybody who can look around
this demented world we live in...

303
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:28,038
and tell me man
is a noble creature...

304
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:30,413
believe me,
that man is full of bullshit.

305
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,114
- What's so goddamn funny?
- l can't help it. lt's funny.

306
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:39,860
This is going out live
to 67 affiliates.

307
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:41,360
Leave him on.

308
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:45,922
And l was married for 33 years
of shrill, shrieking fraud.

309
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,595
- Mr. Hackett's trying to reach you.
- Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself.

310
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,662
So l don't have any bullshit left.

311
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:56,800
l just ran out of it, you see.

312
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,984
Mr. Ruddy, could we have
one statement, please?

313
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:07,145
Sorry, l don't have
all the information yet.

314
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:14,560
lf we could just have one statement
about Mr. Beale.

315
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:26,005
Max?

316
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:36,749
l'll want to see Mr. Beale
after this.

317
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:41,880
The way l hear it,
you were primarily responsible...

318
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:44,288
for this colossally
stupid prank.

319
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:47,323
- ls that the fact?
- That's the fact.

320
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:49,954
lt was unconscionable.

321
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:56,770
- There is nothing more to say.
- l have something to say.

322
00:20:57,905 --> 00:21:00,772
l want to know why that debasement
of the News Division...

323
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:04,470
announced at the meeting this afternoon
was kept secret from me?

324
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:08,045
You and l go back 20 years.

325
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,640
l took this job
with your personal assurance...

326
00:21:10,718 --> 00:21:14,484
that you'd back my autonomy
against any encroachment.

327
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:19,288
But ever since CCA acquired control
of UBS Systems ten months ago...

328
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,692
Hackett's been taking over everything.

329
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:25,960
Who is running this network?
You or some conglomerate called CCA?

330
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,831
You're president
of the Systems Group.

331
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:32,464
Hackett's nothing
but a hatchet man for CCA.

332
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:35,201
Nelson here,
president of the network...

333
00:21:35,276 --> 00:21:38,040
and he hasn't a damned thing to say
about anything anymore.

334
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:40,706
l told you
at the stockholders' meeting...

335
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:44,615
that we would discuss all that
at our regular meeting tomorrow morning.

336
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:47,017
lf you had been patient,
l would have explained...

337
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:49,647
that l, too, thought
Frank Hackett precipitate...

338
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:52,624
and that the reorganization of the
News Division would not be executed...

339
00:21:52,693 --> 00:21:55,218
until everyone,
specifically you, Max...

340
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:58,231
had been consulted and satisfied.

341
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:01,133
lnstead, you sulked off
like a child...

342
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:04,227
and engaged this network
in a shocking and disgraceful episode.

343
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:06,296
Your position
is no longer tenable...

344
00:22:06,373 --> 00:22:08,705
regardless of how management
is restructured.

345
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:13,008
l will expect your resignation
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

346
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,811
We will coordinate our statements
to the least detriment of everyone.

347
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:22,411
Bob McDonough will take over the News
Division until we sort all this out.

348
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:27,289
l'd like to see Mr. Beale now.

349
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:30,125
They're looking for him.
They don't know where he is.

350
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:35,162
Well, every day, five days a week
for 15 years...

351
00:22:35,235 --> 00:22:38,762
l've been sitting behind that desk,
the dispassionate pundit...

352
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,865
reporting with seemly detachment...

353
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:45,537
the daily parade of lunacies
that constitute the news.

354
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:47,045
Just once...

355
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:49,105
l wanted to say
what l really felt.

356
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:50,810
Knock it off.

357
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:52,749
lt was, after all, my last one.

358
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:12,465
- Have the overnight ratings come in?
- They're on your desk.

359
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,473
Have you got
yesterday's overnights?

360
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,771
- Shall l bring them in?
- Yeah.

361
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:25,577
These are the outlines submitted
by Universal for an hour series.

362
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:28,712
You needn't bother to read them.
l'll tell them to you.

363
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:33,385
The first one is set in an eastern
law school, presumably Harvard.

364
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,588
The series is irresistibly entitled
"The New Lawyers."

365
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:40,030
The running characters are: a crusty
but benign ex-Supreme Court justice...

366
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,536
presumably Oliver Wendell Holmes
by way of Dr. Zorba...

367
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:47,040
a beautiful girl graduate student,
and the local district attorney...

368
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:49,041
who is brilliant
and sometimes cuts corners.

369
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:51,009
Next one.

370
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:53,069
The second one's called
"The Amazon Squad."

371
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:54,705
Lady cops.

372
00:23:54,782 --> 00:23:57,615
Running characters include a crusty
but benign police lieutenant...

373
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,982
who's always getting heat
from the commissioner...

374
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:03,785
a tough, hard-drinking detective who
thinks women belong in the kitchen...

375
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:07,554
and a brilliant, beautiful young cop
who's fighting the feminist battle.

376
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:09,687
We're up to our ears in lady cops.

377
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:12,857
Next is another one of those
investigative reporter shows.

378
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,561
A crusty but benign managing editor
who's always getting--

379
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,729
You know, Barbara...

380
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:22,105
the Arabs have decided to jack up
the price of oil another 20 percent.

381
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:26,877
The ClA has been caught opening
Senator Humphrey's mail.

382
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:30,906
There's a civil war in Angola.
Another one in Beirut.

383
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:34,711
New York City's still facing default.

384
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:37,655
They finally caught up
with Patricia Hearst.

385
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:41,455
And the whole front page
of the Daily News is Howard Beale.

386
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:46,522
There's also a two-column story
on page one of the Times.

387
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:51,668
Helen?
Call Mr. Hackett's office.

388
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:54,172
See if he can give me
a few minutes this morning.

389
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:05,150
KTNS Kansas City refuses to carry
our " Network News Show" anymore...

390
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:07,153
unless Beale is taken off the air.

391
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:09,348
Did you see the overnights
on the " Network News" ?

392
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:12,153
lt has an 8 in New York,
a 9 in L.A....

393
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:14,660
and a 27 share in both cities.

394
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:17,925
Last night, Howard Beale went on the air
and yelled " bullshit" for two minutes.

395
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:22,230
l can tell you tonight's show
will get a 30 share at least.

396
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:25,533
- l think we've lucked into something.
- For God sakes, Diana!

397
00:25:25,606 --> 00:25:28,803
Are you suggesting we put that lunatic
back on the air yelling " bullshit" ?

398
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:32,368
Yes, l think we should put Beale back
on the air tonight and keep him on.

399
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:35,244
Did you see the news this morning?
Did you see the Times?

400
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:37,943
We got press coverage on this
you couldn't buy for a million dollars.

401
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:43,957
That show jumped 5 points in one night.
Tonight's show will be at least 15.

402
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:48,586
We've just increased our audience by
20 or 30 million people in one night!

403
00:25:48,662 --> 00:25:51,426
You won't get something like this dumped
into your lap the rest of your days.

404
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:55,628
You can't piss it away. Howard said
last night what every American feels.

405
00:25:55,702 --> 00:26:00,765
He's tired of all the bullshit!
He's articulating the popular rage!

406
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:02,866
l want that show, Frank.

407
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:05,138
l can turn that show
into the biggest smash on TV.

408
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:08,204
lt's a news show.
lt's not your department.

409
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:11,012
l see Howard Beale
as a latter-day prophet...

410
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:15,180
a messianic figure inveighing
against the hypocrisies of our times!

411
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:17,815
A strip Savonarola
Monday through Friday...

412
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:20,257
that will just go through the roof!

413
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:24,286
And l'm talking about
a six-dollar cost per thousand show.

414
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:27,424
l'm talking about
130,000 dollar minutes.

415
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:31,267
Figure out the revenues of a strip show
that sells for $100,000 a minute!

416
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:35,104
One show like that could pull
this network out of the hole!

417
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:38,372
lt's being handed to us on a plate.
Let's not blow it.

418
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,680
Yes.

419
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:43,943
Tell him l'll be a few minutes.

420
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,717
- Let me think it over.
- Let's not go to committee on this.

421
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,624
lt's 10:20. We want Beale in the studio
by 6:30. We don't want to lose momentum.

422
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:57,790
For God sakes, we're talking about
putting an irresponsible man...

423
00:26:57,864 --> 00:27:00,355
on national television.

424
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,874
l'd like to talk to Legal Affairs,
Herb Thackery...

425
00:27:12,946 --> 00:27:15,540
and Joe Donnelly
in Standards and Practices.

426
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:20,414
You know l'll be eyeball to eyeball
with Mr. Ruddy on this.

427
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:23,684
lf l'm going to the mat with Ruddy,
l want to be sure of my ground.

428
00:27:23,757 --> 00:27:25,987
My ass is going on the line.

429
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:31,330
l'll get back to you.

430
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:37,059
l don't believe the top brass...

431
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:41,198
of a national television network
is sitting around their Caesar salads--

432
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:43,607
Top brass of a bankrupt
national television network...

433
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:46,339
with projected losses
of $150 million.

434
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:47,846
l don't care!

435
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:53,219
You can't be seriously proposing,
and the rest of us considering...

436
00:27:53,287 --> 00:27:55,812
putting on a pornographic
network news show.

437
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:58,119
- The FCC would kill us.
- Sit down, Nelson.

438
00:27:58,191 --> 00:28:01,160
The FCC can't do anything
except rap our knuckles.

439
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:04,391
l don't even want to think about
the litigious possibilities.

440
00:28:04,464 --> 00:28:07,763
-We could be up to our ears in lawsuits.
-The affiliates won't carry it.

441
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:10,860
The affiliates will kiss your ass
if you can hand them a hit show.

442
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:13,201
- But popular reaction--
- We don't know the popular reaction.

443
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:16,470
- That's what we have to find out.
- The New York Times--

444
00:28:16,543 --> 00:28:19,979
The New York Times doesn't advertise
on our network.

445
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:26,249
All l know is, this violates
every canon of respectable broadcasting.

446
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,551
We're not a respectable network.
We're a whorehouse network.

447
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:31,784
We have to take whatever we can get.

448
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:35,194
l don't want any part of it.

449
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:37,730
l don't fancy myself
the president of a whorehouse.

450
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:40,596
That's commendable of you, Nelson.
Now sit down.

451
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:43,669
Your indignation
has been duly recorded.

452
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:45,671
You can always resign tomorrow.

453
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:51,843
What in substance are we proposing?

454
00:28:51,912 --> 00:28:55,871
Merely to add editorial comment
to our network news show.

455
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:59,715
Brinkley, Sevareid, Reasoner
all have their comments.

456
00:28:59,786 --> 00:29:01,879
Now Howard Beale will have his.

457
00:29:01,955 --> 00:29:06,016
l think we ought to give it a shot,
see what happens tonight. Telephone.

458
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:09,551
l don't want to be the messenger
who has to tell Schumacher about this.

459
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:13,395
He doesn't work at this network anymore.
Mr. Ruddy fired him last night.

460
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:16,436
Bob McDonough is running
the News Division now.

461
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:19,829
Bob McDonough in News, please.

462
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:23,468
l don't know.

463
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:26,011
l may teach or write a book--

464
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,175
whatever the hell one does when one
approaches the autumn of one's years.

465
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:34,920
My God! ls that me?

466
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:38,180
Was l ever that young?

467
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:40,692
No, Howard brought in a picture
of Ed Murrow...

468
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:43,252
and the CBS gang
when we were there.

469
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,854
You wouldn't believe it!

470
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:47,058
Walter Cronkite, Harry Reasoner...

471
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:49,159
Hollenbeck, Bob Trout.

472
00:29:49,236 --> 00:29:51,170
ls that you?

473
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:56,105
Yeah. Okay, Dick,
we'll be in touch.

474
00:29:56,176 --> 00:30:00,579
Remember this kid you sent to interview
Cleveland Amory on vivisection?

475
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:06,547
What's so funny?

476
00:30:09,156 --> 00:30:12,683
l jump out of bed in my pajamas,
l grab my raincoat, l run downstairs.

477
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:15,387
l run out to the street
and hail a cab.

478
00:30:15,462 --> 00:30:20,490
l yell at the driver, " Take me to the
middle of the George Washington Bridge."

479
00:30:22,602 --> 00:30:26,299
And the driver says,
"Don't do it, buddy. Don't do it!

480
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:28,864
You're young. You've got
your whole life ahead of you."

481
00:30:29,843 --> 00:30:32,175
Wait a minute.

482
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:36,773
lf you think that's funny,
wait till you hear this.

483
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,784
l've come from Hackett's office.

484
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:41,616
He wants to put Howard
back on the air tonight.

485
00:30:41,688 --> 00:30:44,782
Apparently the ratings went up
five points last night...

486
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:48,123
and he wants Howard to go back on
and do his " angry man" thing.

487
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:50,288
What are you talking about?

488
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:53,423
They want Howard to go back on
and yell " bullshit."

489
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:57,970
They want Howard to go on...

490
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:00,029
spontaneously letting out
his anger.

491
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:03,075
A latter-day prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.

492
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:05,373
That sounds pretty good!

493
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,712
Who's " they" ?

494
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:10,443
Hackett. Chaney was there.

495
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:13,645
The Legal Affairs guy.
Oh, and that girl from programming.

496
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,154
Christensen?
What's she got to do with this?

497
00:31:16,223 --> 00:31:18,987
- Are you kidding?
- l'm not kidding.

498
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:22,790
l said, " We're running
a news department here, not a circus.

499
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:25,423
And Howard Beale's
not a bearded lady.

500
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:28,127
lf you think l'll go along with
this bastardization of the news...

501
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:31,637
you can have my resignation
along with Max Schumacher's.

502
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:37,541
- l'm speaking for Howard Beale and--"
- That's my job you're turning down.

503
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:40,444
l'd go nuts
without some kind of work.

504
00:31:40,514 --> 00:31:44,541
What's wrong with being an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?

505
00:31:44,618 --> 00:31:46,313
What do you think, Max?

506
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:50,618
Do you want to be an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?

507
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,184
Yeah, l'd like to be an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.

508
00:31:56,463 --> 00:31:58,454
Then grab it!

509
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:06,872
- Afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.
- Afternoon.

510
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,874
Good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.

511
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:14,344
- He's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

512
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:24,021
Nelson Chaney tells me Beale
may actually go on the air this evening.

513
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:28,157
As far as l know,
Howard's going to do it.

514
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:33,494
- Are you gonna sit still for this?
- Yes.

515
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:36,297
l think Hackett's overstepped himself.

516
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:38,929
There's some kind of
corporate maneuvering going on.

517
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:41,530
Hackett is clearly forcing
a confrontation.

518
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:43,803
That would account for his behavior
at the stockholders' meeting.

519
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:48,473
However, l think he's making a serious
mistake with this Beale business.

520
00:32:48,548 --> 00:32:51,676
l suspect CCA will be upset...

521
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:53,719
at Hackett's presumptuousness.

522
00:32:53,787 --> 00:32:55,948
Certainly Mr. Jensen will.

523
00:32:56,022 --> 00:32:59,583
So l'm going to let Hackett
have his head for a while.

524
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:02,321
He just might lose it
over this Beale business.

525
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:09,331
l'd like you to reconsider
your resignation.

526
00:33:09,402 --> 00:33:11,893
l assume Hackett
wouldn't take such steps...

527
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:14,270
without some support
on the CCA board.

528
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:17,208
l'll have to go directly to Mr. Jensen.

529
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:20,508
When that happens, l'm going to need
every friend l've got...

530
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,277
and l don't want Hackett's people
in all the divisional positions.

531
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,546
So l'd like you to stay on.

532
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:32,524
Of course.

533
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:36,957
Thank you, Max.

534
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,498
This has been
the " UBS Evening News" ...

535
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:42,000
with Howard Beale.

536
00:33:42,068 --> 00:33:44,696
The initial response to the new
"Howard Beale Show" ...

537
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:46,830
was not auspicatory.

538
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:48,931
The press was,
without exception, hostile...

539
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:51,204
and industry reaction negative.

540
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:53,609
The ratings for the Thursday
and Friday shows...

541
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,205
were both 14,
but Monday's rating dropped a point...

542
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:59,547
clearly suggesting the novelty
was wearing off.

543
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:03,549
Did you know there are
a number of psychics...

544
00:34:03,623 --> 00:34:06,558
working as licensed brokers
on Wall Street?

545
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:09,060
Some counsel their clients
by use of tarot cards.

546
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:12,860
They're all pretty successful,
even in a bear market and selling short.

547
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:16,527
l met one of them last week
and thought of doing a show around her.

548
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:19,231
"The Wayward Witch of Wall Street."
Something like that.

549
00:34:19,305 --> 00:34:21,830
But if her tips were any good,
she could wreck the market.

550
00:34:21,908 --> 00:34:27,437
l called her this morning and asked her
how she was on predicting the future.

551
00:34:27,514 --> 00:34:30,210
She said she was
occasionally prescient.

552
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:34,913
"For example," she said,
"l just had a vision of you...

553
00:34:34,988 --> 00:34:37,980
sitting in an office
with a craggy, middle-aged man...

554
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:41,494
with whom you are
or will be emotionally involved."

555
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:43,153
And here l am.

556
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,192
She does all this with tarot cards?

557
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:51,135
This one operates
on parapsychology.

558
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:55,504
She has trance-like episodes
and feels things in her energy field.

559
00:34:56,476 --> 00:35:00,173
- This lady could be very useful to you.
- ln what way?

560
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:02,840
You put on a news show.

561
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:06,147
And here's somebody who can predict
tomorrow's news for you.

562
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:08,551
Her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl.

563
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:10,555
Sibyl the Soothsayer.

564
00:35:10,623 --> 00:35:13,217
You could give her
two minutes of trance...

565
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:15,887
at the end of the " Howard Beale Show,"
say once a week, Friday...

566
00:35:15,962 --> 00:35:18,396
which is suggestively occult,
and she could oraculate.

567
00:35:19,632 --> 00:35:22,567
Then next week everyone tunes in to see
how good her predictions were.

568
00:35:23,703 --> 00:35:25,728
Maybe she could do the weather.

569
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:31,010
Your " Network News Show" will need help
if it's going to hold.

570
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:33,568
Beale doesn't do the " angry man" thing
well at all.

571
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:35,671
He's too kvetchy.
He's being irascible.

572
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:38,912
We want a prophet, not a curmudgeon.
He should do more apocalyptic doom.

573
00:35:38,985 --> 00:35:42,819
l think you should have some writers
write some jeremiads for him.

574
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,454
l see you don't fancy my suggestions.

575
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:50,492
You're not serious?

576
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:52,292
l'm serious.

577
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,325
The fact is, l could make
your Beale show...

578
00:35:56,402 --> 00:36:00,361
the highest-rated news show in TV
if you'd let me have a crack at it.

579
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:03,571
What do you mean,
"have a crack at it" ?

580
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:05,508
l'd like to program it for you.

581
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:07,170
Develop it.

582
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:11,946
l wouldn't interfere with
the news itself, but TV is show biz...

583
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:15,954
and even the news has to have
a little showmanship.

584
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:18,286
My God, you are serious.

585
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:22,522
l watched your six o'clock news today.
lt's straight tabloid.

586
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:26,122
You had a minute and a half of that lady
riding naked in Central Park...

587
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:29,293
but you had less than a minute
of hard national and international news.

588
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:32,065
lt was all sex, scandal,
brutal crime, sports...

589
00:36:32,138 --> 00:36:35,471
children with incurable diseases
and lost puppies.

590
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:38,943
So l won't listen to protestations
of high standards of journalism...

591
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:41,879
when you're on the streets, soliciting
audiences like the rest of us.

592
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:45,975
All l'm saying is, if you're going
to hustle, at least do it right.

593
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:49,146
l'm going to bring this up at tomorrow's
meeting, but l don't like hassles.

594
00:36:49,222 --> 00:36:52,589
l was hoping we could work this out
between us. That's why l'm here.

595
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:57,494
And l was hoping you were looking for
an emotional involvement...

596
00:36:57,564 --> 00:36:59,759
with a craggy, middle-aged man.

597
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:03,326
l wouldn't rule that out entirely.

598
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:09,071
All right, Diana...

599
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:12,873
bring up all your ideas at the meeting,
because if you don't, l will.

600
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,848
l think Howard's making
a goddamn fool of himself...

601
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:21,046
and so does everybody that Howard
and l know in this industry.

602
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,486
lt was a fluke.
Didn't work.

603
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:27,851
So tomorrow, Howard goes back
to the old format...

604
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:31,795
and all of this gutter depravity
comes to an end.

605
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:45,341
l don't get it.

606
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:49,805
You hung around until 7:30
and then came down here...

607
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:52,818
just to pitch a couple
of loony show-biz ideas...

608
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:56,788
when you knew goddamn well
l'd laugh you right out of the office.

609
00:37:56,856 --> 00:37:59,256
l don't get it.

610
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:02,158
What's your scam in this?

611
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:07,632
My visit here tonight was a gesture made
out of your stature in the industry...

612
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:11,631
and because l personally admired you
since l was a kid...

613
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:14,229
majoring in speech
at the University of Missouri.

614
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:19,274
Sooner or later, with or without you,
l'm going to take over your news show.

615
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:21,870
l figured l might as well start tonight.

616
00:38:23,149 --> 00:38:25,845
l think l once gave a lecture...

617
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:29,184
at the University of Missouri.

618
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:33,919
l was in the audience. l had
a schoolgirl crush on you for months.

619
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:38,928
lf we could get back for a moment
to that gypsy who predicted...

620
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:43,230
all that about emotional involvements
and middle-aged men...

621
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:46,871
what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

622
00:38:56,182 --> 00:38:58,878
l can't make it tonight.
Call me tomorrow.

623
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:04,550
- Do you have a favorite restaurant?
- l eat anything.

624
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:08,120
l get a feeling l'm being made.

625
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:09,627
You are.

626
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:13,960
l've got to warn you.
l don't do anything on my first date.

627
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:15,466
We'll see.

628
00:39:21,474 --> 00:39:23,738
Schmuck, what are you getting into?

629
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:49,259
l was married for four years
and pretended to be happy.

630
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:51,963
l had six years of analysis
and pretended to be sane.

631
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:56,435
My husband ran off
with his boyfriend...

632
00:39:56,509 --> 00:40:01,105
and l had an affair with my analyst who
told me l was the worst lay he ever had.

633
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:05,283
l can't tell you how many men
have told me what a lousy lay l am.

634
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:08,586
l apparently have
a masculine temperament.

635
00:40:08,654 --> 00:40:12,522
l arouse quickly,
consummate prematurely...

636
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:15,652
and l can't wait to get my clothes
back on and get out of that bedroom.

637
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:20,832
l seem to be inept at everything
except my work.

638
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:23,964
l'm good at my work.

639
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:26,597
So l confine myself to that.

640
00:40:26,672 --> 00:40:30,130
All l want out of life
is a 30 share and a 20 rating.

641
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:33,838
You're married, surely?

642
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:36,848
Twenty-five years.

643
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:41,182
l have a married daughter in Seattle
who's six months pregnant...

644
00:40:41,254 --> 00:40:46,419
and a younger girl who's starting
at Northwestern in January.

645
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:51,195
Well, Max, here we are.

646
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:56,030
Middle-aged man reaffirming
his middle-aged manhood...

647
00:40:56,102 --> 00:40:59,094
and a terrified young woman
with a father complex.

648
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:01,663
What sort of script
can we make out of this?

649
00:41:03,743 --> 00:41:08,146
Corridor gossip says that you're
Frank Hackett's backstage girl.

650
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:10,615
l'm not.

651
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:15,652
Frank's a corporation man,
body and soul.

652
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:17,712
He has no loves, lusts
or allegiances...

653
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,248
that are not consummately directed
toward becoming a CCA board member.

654
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:24,160
Why should he bother with me?
l'm not even a stockholder.

655
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:30,298
What about your loves,
lusts and allegiances?

656
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:32,530
ls your wife in town?

657
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:34,038
Yes.

658
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:37,776
Then we better go to my place.

659
00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:42,113
l can't hear you.
You'll have to talk a little louder.

660
00:41:48,855 --> 00:41:51,881
Yes, l hear you.

661
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:56,894
Yes.

662
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:01,132
Yes.

663
00:42:07,073 --> 00:42:08,540
Why me?

664
00:42:10,476 --> 00:42:12,706
l said, " Why me?"

665
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:35,033
Howard in his office?

666
00:42:36,169 --> 00:42:41,232
l'm killing this whole screwball
"angry prophet" thing.

667
00:42:41,307 --> 00:42:43,537
Tonight we go back to straight news.

668
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:53,977
Yeah? Max, l'm telling you he's fine.

669
00:42:54,053 --> 00:42:57,113
He's been sharp all day.
He's been as funny as hell.

670
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,420
Had everybody cracking up
at the rundown meeting.

671
00:42:59,492 --> 00:43:01,483
l told him!

672
00:43:02,295 --> 00:43:03,728
Cue VTA.

673
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:05,930
Ready two.

674
00:43:08,234 --> 00:43:11,499
- Cue announcer.
- The " UBS Evening News" ...

675
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:13,596
with Howard Beale.

676
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:18,441
Last night l was awakened
from a fitful sleep...

677
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:21,173
shortly after 2:00 in the morning...

678
00:43:21,247 --> 00:43:24,307
by a shrill, sibilant,
faceless voice.

679
00:43:24,383 --> 00:43:28,012
l couldn't make it out at first
in the dark bedroom.

680
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:32,183
l said, " l'm sorry.
You'll have to talk a little louder."

681
00:43:32,258 --> 00:43:35,955
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing.

682
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:39,327
The voice said to me,
"l want you to tell the truth.

683
00:43:39,398 --> 00:43:42,265
Not easy to do, because the people
don't want to know the truth."

684
00:43:42,335 --> 00:43:45,065
l said, " You're kidding?

685
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:47,071
What should l know about the truth?"

686
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:51,701
But the voice said to me,
"Don't worry about the truth."

687
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:53,745
l will put the words in your mouth."

688
00:43:54,814 --> 00:43:56,748
l said,
"ls this the burning bush?

689
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:58,249
l'm not Moses."

690
00:43:58,317 --> 00:44:01,582
The voice said, " l'm not God.
What has that got to do with it?"

691
00:44:01,654 --> 00:44:06,023
The voice said, " We're not talking
about eternal, absolute truth.

692
00:44:06,092 --> 00:44:08,822
We're talking about impermanent,
transient, human truth!

693
00:44:08,894 --> 00:44:11,795
l don't expect people
to be capable of truth...

694
00:44:11,864 --> 00:44:14,389
but at least you're capable
of self-preservation."

695
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:19,232
l said, " Why me?"

696
00:44:19,305 --> 00:44:22,035
The voice said, " Because you're
on television, dummy."

697
00:44:22,108 --> 00:44:24,338
Beautiful.

698
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,538
"Forty million Americans listen to you,
and after the show, maybe 50 million.

699
00:44:27,613 --> 00:44:31,845
l'm not asking you to walk the land
in sackcloth preaching the Armageddon.

700
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:33,350
You're on TV."

701
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:36,350
l thought about it for a moment.

702
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,315
Then l said, " Okay."

703
00:45:00,946 --> 00:45:02,880
Close the door, Harry.

704
00:45:06,352 --> 00:45:09,219
Howard, l'm taking you off the air.

705
00:45:10,456 --> 00:45:13,653
l think you're having a breakdown,
require treatment.

706
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:19,326
This is not a psychotic episode.

707
00:45:19,398 --> 00:45:22,060
This is a cleansing moment of clarity.

708
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:27,906
l'm imbued.

709
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:33,269
l'm imbued with some special spirit.
lt's not a religious feeling at all.

710
00:45:33,346 --> 00:45:36,975
lt's a shocking eruption
of great electrical energy.

711
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:39,483
l feel vivid and flashing...

712
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:44,717
as if suddenly l'd been plugged
into a great electromagnetic field.

713
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:49,288
l feel connected to all living things.

714
00:45:49,362 --> 00:45:52,490
To flowers, birds...

715
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:55,623
all the animals of the world...

716
00:45:57,436 --> 00:46:02,897
and even to some great,
unseen living force--

717
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:05,739
what l think the Hindus
call " prana."

718
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:09,174
But it's not a breakdown.

719
00:46:09,248 --> 00:46:11,978
l've never felt more orderly
in my life.

720
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:16,283
lt is a shattering
and beautiful sensation.

721
00:46:17,156 --> 00:46:20,922
lt is the exalted flow
of the space-time continuum...

722
00:46:20,993 --> 00:46:24,258
save that it is spaceless
and timeless...

723
00:46:25,664 --> 00:46:27,598
and such loveliness.

724
00:46:29,068 --> 00:46:34,563
l feel on the verge
of some great ultimate truth.

725
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:44,782
And you will not take me off the air
for now or any other spaceless time!

726
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:54,152
- ls he okay?
- He's just fainted.

727
00:46:54,226 --> 00:46:57,252
l better get him back to my house
again tonight.

728
00:46:57,329 --> 00:46:59,422
Help me get him up.

729
00:47:20,152 --> 00:47:22,086
This is crazy.

730
00:47:23,522 --> 00:47:26,923
The whole place has gone crazy.
They just seem to hassle me.

731
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:50,275
Wake up, Max,
because Howard's gone.

732
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:54,503
l'll make you some coffee.

733
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,707
You don't know where he is?
The son of a bitch is a hit!

734
00:48:56,782 --> 00:48:59,410
Goddamn it!
Over 2,000 phone calls!

735
00:48:59,485 --> 00:49:03,888
ln the mail room, over 14,000 telegrams!
The response is sensational!

736
00:49:03,956 --> 00:49:06,186
Tell him.
Herb's phone hasn't stopped ringing.

737
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:11,560
Every affiliate from Albuquerque
to Sandusky! Response is sensational!

738
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,996
Yes. All right.

739
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:16,364
For you, Herb.
Go to your office.

740
00:49:16,435 --> 00:49:19,893
Moldanian called me. Joe Donnelly
called me. We've got a goddamn hit!

741
00:49:19,972 --> 00:49:24,102
Show him the Times. We even got
an editorial in the New York Times.

742
00:49:24,176 --> 00:49:26,406
-" A Call to Morality."
- l don't know where he is.

743
00:49:26,478 --> 00:49:29,504
That crazy Beale has caught on. Don't
tell me you don't know where he is.

744
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:32,176
He could be jumping off a roof
for all l know!

745
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:35,687
The man is insane!
He's not responsible for himself!

746
00:49:35,754 --> 00:49:37,745
He needs care and treatment.

747
00:49:37,823 --> 00:49:42,021
All you grave robbers think about
is that he's a hit.

748
00:49:42,094 --> 00:49:44,654
lt's just possible
that he isn't insane...

749
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,893
that he is, in fact,
imbued with some special spirit.

750
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:51,528
l'm supposed to be the romantic!
You're the hard-bitten realist!

751
00:49:51,604 --> 00:49:54,664
All right. Howard Beale
obviously fills a void.

752
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,708
The audience
obviously wants a prophet...

753
00:49:56,775 --> 00:49:59,608
even a manufactured one--
even if he's as mad as Moses.

754
00:49:59,678 --> 00:50:02,340
By tomorrow he'll have a 50 share,
maybe a 60.

755
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:04,382
Howard Beale
is processed instant God.

756
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,248
lt looks like he may go over bigger
than Mary Tyler Moore.

757
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:10,083
l am not putting Howard
back on the air!

758
00:50:10,155 --> 00:50:12,123
lt's not your show anymore.
lt's mine.

759
00:50:15,194 --> 00:50:16,752
l gave her the show.

760
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:20,026
l'm putting the " Network News Show"
under programming.

761
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:23,227
Mr. Ruddy had a heart attack
and is not taking calls.

762
00:50:23,302 --> 00:50:26,271
ln his absence,
l'm making all network decisions...

763
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:29,967
including one l've been wanting to make
a long time: you're fired.

764
00:50:30,743 --> 00:50:32,677
l want you out of this building
by noon.

765
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:36,044
l'll call security and have you
thrown out if you're still here.

766
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:41,280
Well, let's say
fuck you, Hackett.

767
00:50:41,353 --> 00:50:43,412
You want me out of here...

768
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:47,391
you'll have to drag me and the whole
News Division out kicking and screaming.

769
00:50:47,459 --> 00:50:50,121
You think they'll quit their jobs
for you? Not in this recession.

770
00:50:50,195 --> 00:50:52,129
Ruddy will have your ass.

771
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:55,689
l got a hit!
Ruddy doesn't count anymore!

772
00:50:55,768 --> 00:50:58,635
He was hoping l'd fall on my face
with this Beale show, but l didn't.

773
00:50:58,704 --> 00:51:01,696
lt's a big, fat, big-titted hit...

774
00:51:01,774 --> 00:51:03,935
and l don't have to waffle around
with Ruddy anymore.

775
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:06,307
lf he wants to take me before
the CCA board, let him.

776
00:51:06,378 --> 00:51:09,279
Do you think Ruddy is stupid enough
to go to the CCA board and say...

777
00:51:09,348 --> 00:51:11,646
"l'm taking our one hit show
off the air."

778
00:51:11,717 --> 00:51:16,484
Come November 14, l'll be at the annual
CCA Management Review Meeting...

779
00:51:16,555 --> 00:51:19,046
and l'll announce projected earnings
for this network...

780
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:21,285
for the first time in five years!

781
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,421
Believe me, Mr. Jensen will be
sitting there, rocking back and forth...

782
00:51:25,497 --> 00:51:29,957
and he'll say, " That's very good, Frank.
Keep it up."

783
00:51:30,035 --> 00:51:33,527
So don't have illusions about who's
running this network. You're fired.

784
00:51:33,605 --> 00:51:37,302
l want you out of your office before
noon, or l'll have you thrown out.

785
00:51:41,547 --> 00:51:43,139
You go along with this?

786
00:51:44,516 --> 00:51:46,984
l told you l didn't want
a network hassle.

787
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:50,647
l told you l'd much rather
work the Beale show out between us.

788
00:51:52,558 --> 00:51:54,890
Well, let's just say
fuck you, too, honey.

789
00:51:56,729 --> 00:51:59,095
Howard Beale may be my best friend.
l'll go to court.

790
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:02,292
l'll put him in a hospital before l let
you exploit him like a carnival freak.

791
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:04,198
You get your psychiatrist.
l'll get mine.

792
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:07,705
l'm gonna spread this reeking business
in every newspaper...

793
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:10,640
on every network, group and affiliate
in this country!

794
00:52:10,709 --> 00:52:12,870
l'm gonna make
a lot of noise about this!

795
00:52:12,945 --> 00:52:15,243
We need all the press we can get!

796
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,209
Something going on
between you and Schumacher?

797
00:52:21,754 --> 00:52:23,381
Not anymore.

798
00:52:41,874 --> 00:52:44,138
- How do you do, Mr. Beale?
- l must make my witness.

799
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:46,302
Sure thing, Mr. Beale.

800
00:52:49,848 --> 00:52:52,544
Oil ministers of the OPEC nations
meeting in Vienna...

801
00:52:52,618 --> 00:52:57,021
still haven't decided how much
to increase the price of oil.

802
00:52:57,089 --> 00:53:00,217
Yeah? He came in the building
five minutes ago.

803
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:03,056
Tell Snowden when he comes in
to let him go on.

804
00:53:03,128 --> 00:53:05,062
Did you get that, Paul?

805
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:10,529
More on that story
from Edward Fletcher in Vienna.

806
00:53:10,602 --> 00:53:14,436
This has been the most divisive meeting
the oil states have ever had.

807
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:19,869
The 13 nations of OPEC
have still not...

808
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:23,073
been able to decide by how much
to increase the price of oil.

809
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,718
How much time we got?

810
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,954
We've got five seconds.
Hurry up.

811
00:53:34,459 --> 00:53:36,359
Take two. Cue Howard.

812
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:39,955
l don't have to tell you things are bad.
Everybody knows things are bad.

813
00:53:40,032 --> 00:53:41,966
lt's a depression.

814
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:46,334
Everybody's out of work
or scared of losing their job.

815
00:53:46,405 --> 00:53:49,397
The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
Banks are going bust.

816
00:53:49,474 --> 00:53:53,570
Shopkeepers keep guns under the counter.
Punks are running wild in the street.

817
00:53:53,645 --> 00:53:56,443
Nobody anywhere seems to know
what to do, and there's no end to it.

818
00:53:57,883 --> 00:54:02,582
We know the air is unfit to breathe
and our food is unfit to eat.

819
00:54:02,654 --> 00:54:05,885
We sit watching our TVs
while some newscaster tells us...

820
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:09,553
that today we had 15 homicides
and 63 violent crimes...

821
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:11,562
as if that's the way
it's supposed to be!

822
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:14,997
We know things are bad.
Worse than bad. They're crazy.

823
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:18,400
Everything everywhere is going crazy,
so we don't go out anymore.

824
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,871
We sit in the house. Slowly the world
we're living in is getting smaller.

825
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,376
All we say is, " Please. At least
leave us alone in our living rooms.

826
00:54:25,444 --> 00:54:28,902
Let me have my toaster, my TV
my steel-belted radials.

827
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:31,040
l won't say anything
Just leave us alone."

828
00:54:31,116 --> 00:54:34,608
l'm not gonna leave you alone.
l want you to get mad!

829
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:38,212
l don't want you to protest or riot.

830
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:40,884
Don't write to your congressman.
l don't know what to tell you to write.

831
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:43,484
l don't know what to do
about depression, inflation...

832
00:54:43,562 --> 00:54:45,553
the Russians,
the crime in the streets.

833
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:48,600
All l know is that first
you've got to get mad!

834
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:51,693
You've got to say,
"l'm a human being, goddamn it!

835
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,795
My life has value!"

836
00:54:56,441 --> 00:55:00,901
So, l want you to get up now.

837
00:55:00,979 --> 00:55:04,346
l want all of you to get up
out of your chairs.

838
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:07,749
l want you to get up now
and go to the window...

839
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:11,084
open it,
stick your head out and yell...

840
00:55:11,156 --> 00:55:15,684
"l'm as mad as hell, and l'm
not gonna take this anymore!"

841
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:17,695
l want you to get up right now.

842
00:55:17,763 --> 00:55:20,391
- Stay with him.
- Sit up! Go to your windows.

843
00:55:20,465 --> 00:55:22,729
Open them,
stick your head out and yell...

844
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:25,929
"l'm as mad as hell, and l'm
not gonna take this anymore!"

845
00:55:26,939 --> 00:55:29,373
- How many stations does it go out live?
- Sixty-seven.

846
00:55:31,677 --> 00:55:33,611
"l'm not gonna take this anymore."

847
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,445
Then we'll figure out what to do
about the depression and the oil crisis.

848
00:55:37,516 --> 00:55:39,381
First, get out of your chairs...

849
00:55:39,451 --> 00:55:43,012
open the window,
stick your head out and yell...

850
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:45,215
"l'm as mad as hell...

851
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,622
and l'm not gonna
take this anymore!"

852
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:49,888
- Who are you talking to?
- Atlanta.

853
00:55:49,962 --> 00:55:52,726
Are they yelling in Atlanta?

854
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:54,766
But first you've gotta get mad.

855
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:59,395
You've gotta say, " l'm as mad as hell,
and l'm not gonna take this anymore!"

856
00:55:59,471 --> 00:56:01,405
They're yelling in Baton Rouge.

857
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:04,074
Get up!

858
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:07,805
Son of a bitch!
We've struck the mother lode!

859
00:56:07,879 --> 00:56:11,838
Stick your head out of the window
and keep yelling.

860
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:14,511
Yell, " l'm as mad as hell.

861
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:16,349
l'm not gonna take this anymore."

862
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:18,946
Just get up from your chairs.

863
00:56:19,024 --> 00:56:21,254
- Where you going?
- l want to see if anybody's yelling.

864
00:56:21,326 --> 00:56:23,317
Open it and stick your head out.

865
00:56:23,395 --> 00:56:25,329
Yell and keep yelling--

866
00:56:26,698 --> 00:56:28,962
l'm mad as hell!

867
00:56:29,034 --> 00:56:31,093
l'm not gonna take this anymore!

868
00:56:36,074 --> 00:56:38,941
l'm mad as hell, and l'm
not gonna take it anymore!

869
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:03,529
l'm mad as hell, and l'm not
going to take this anymore!

870
00:57:38,518 --> 00:57:42,386
By mid-October, the " Howard Beale Show"
had settled in at a 42 share...

871
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:46,482
more than equaling all the other
network news shows combined.

872
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,027
ln the Nielsen ratings,
the " Howard Beale Show" ...

873
00:57:49,095 --> 00:57:51,427
was the fourth-highest-rated show
of the month...

874
00:57:51,497 --> 00:57:54,989
surpassed only by " The Six Million
Dollar Man," " All in the Family" ...

875
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:56,329
and " Phyllis" ...

876
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:59,132
a phenomenal state of affairs
for a news show.

877
00:57:59,205 --> 00:58:02,663
On October 15, Diana Christensen
flew to Los Angeles...

878
00:58:02,742 --> 00:58:05,108
for what the trade calls
powwows and confabs...

879
00:58:05,178 --> 00:58:07,578
with her West Coast
programming execs...

880
00:58:07,647 --> 00:58:10,878
and to get production rolling
on the shows for the coming season.

881
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:16,013
Christ! You brought half the William
Morris West Coast Office along with you.

882
00:58:16,088 --> 00:58:20,889
l'm Diana Christensen, a racist lackey
of the imperialist ruling circles.

883
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,690
l'm Laureen Hobbs,
a bad-ass commie nigger.

884
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:26,391
Sounds like the basis
of a firm friendship.

885
00:58:26,465 --> 00:58:28,797
- We'll need more chairs.
- Anybody want coffee?

886
00:58:28,868 --> 00:58:31,166
l'd love some.

887
00:58:36,842 --> 00:58:40,403
This is my lawyer, Sam Haywood,
and his associate, Merrill Grant.

888
00:58:42,748 --> 00:58:47,378
Miss Christensen, just what the hell's
this all about?

889
00:58:47,453 --> 00:58:50,752
Because, when a national
television network...

890
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:55,226
in the person of booby here
comes to me and says...

891
00:58:55,294 --> 00:58:58,457
they want to put the ongoing struggle
of the oppressed masses...

892
00:58:58,531 --> 00:59:00,499
on prime-time television...

893
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:02,500
l have to regard this askance!

894
00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:07,505
Mr. Haywood was saying
that our client, Miss Hobbs...

895
00:59:07,573 --> 00:59:11,634
wants it up front that
the political content of the show...

896
00:59:11,711 --> 00:59:13,975
has to be in her control.

897
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:17,607
She can have it. l don't give a damn
about the political content.

898
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:20,178
What kind of show?

899
00:59:20,253 --> 00:59:23,279
l'm interested in doing
a weekly dramatic series...

900
00:59:23,356 --> 00:59:25,824
based on the
Ecumenical Liberation Army...

901
00:59:25,891 --> 00:59:29,691
and the first show has to be
a two-hour special on Mary Ann Gifford.

902
00:59:29,762 --> 00:59:35,223
l want a lot more film like the bank
rip-off the Ecumenical sent in.

903
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:37,929
The way l see the series is...

904
00:59:38,004 --> 00:59:42,873
each week we open with an authentic act
of political terrorism...

905
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:45,240
taken on the spot
and in the actual moment.

906
00:59:45,311 --> 00:59:48,212
Then we go to the drama behind
the opening film footage.

907
00:59:48,281 --> 00:59:50,442
That's your job, Miss Hobbs.

908
00:59:50,516 --> 00:59:54,475
You've got to get the Ecumenicals
to bring in that film footage for us.

909
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:58,455
The network can't deal with them.
They are wanted criminals.

910
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:02,450
The Ecumenical Liberation Army
is an ultra-left sect...

911
01:00:02,528 --> 01:00:04,052
creating political confusion...

912
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:07,327
with wildcat violence
and pseudo-insurrectionary acts...

913
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,561
which the Communist Party
does not endorse.

914
01:00:09,635 --> 01:00:12,866
The American masses are not yet ready
for open revolt.

915
01:00:12,938 --> 01:00:15,839
We would not want to produce
a television show...

916
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:19,309
celebrating historically
deviational terrorism.

917
01:00:19,378 --> 01:00:22,279
l'm offering you an hour
of prime-time television every week...

918
01:00:22,348 --> 01:00:24,339
into which you can stick
whatever propaganda you want.

919
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:27,784
The Ecumenicals are an undisciplined
ultra-left gang...

920
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:30,378
whose leader is an eccentric,
to say the least.

921
01:00:30,456 --> 01:00:35,257
He calls himself the Great Ahmed Khan
and wears a hussar's shako.

922
01:00:35,328 --> 01:00:38,456
We're talking about
30 to 50 million people a shot.

923
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:40,522
lt's better than handing out...

924
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,227
mimeographed pamphlets
on ghetto street corners.

925
01:00:49,442 --> 01:00:52,502
l'll have to take this matter
to the Central Committee.

926
01:00:53,646 --> 01:00:56,342
And l'd better check it out
with the Great Ahmed Khan.

927
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:02,147
l'll be in L.A. until Saturday,
and l'd like to get it rolling.

928
01:01:36,522 --> 01:01:40,083
Well, Ahmed,
you ain't gonna believe this...

929
01:01:41,394 --> 01:01:44,454
but l'm gonna make
a TV star outta you.

930
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,863
Just like Archie Bunker.

931
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:50,629
You gonna be a household word.

932
01:01:52,304 --> 01:01:54,772
What the fuck are you talking about?

933
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,673
- Thirty seconds.
- Ready VTA.

934
01:01:57,743 --> 01:01:59,938
One, you have the audience to pan.

935
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:02,674
Two, you have the window to pull.

936
01:02:02,748 --> 01:02:04,909
Three, you're on the announcer.

937
01:02:04,984 --> 01:02:06,417
Twenty.

938
01:02:08,554 --> 01:02:09,851
Stand by VTA.

939
01:02:09,922 --> 01:02:13,255
Fifteen, 14, 13, 12...

940
01:02:13,325 --> 01:02:15,953
- Ready A.
- Roll VTA.

941
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:18,622
Nine, 8, 7...

942
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:21,723
6, 5, 4...

943
01:02:21,801 --> 01:02:23,792
3, 2, 1.

944
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,461
Three, cue announcer!

945
01:02:25,538 --> 01:02:28,939
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it!
How do you feel?

946
01:02:29,008 --> 01:02:30,805
We're mad as hell...

947
01:02:30,876 --> 01:02:33,777
and we're not gonna take this anymore!

948
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:35,780
Ladies and gentlemen,
the " Network News Hour" ...

949
01:02:35,848 --> 01:02:37,713
with Sybil the Soothsayer...

950
01:02:41,921 --> 01:02:45,516
Jim Webbing and his
lt's-The-Emmes-Truth Department...

951
01:02:49,195 --> 01:02:51,720
Miss Mata Hari
and her skeletons in the closet.

952
01:02:56,101 --> 01:02:58,501
Plus tonight, another segment
of " Vox Populi."

953
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:06,805
And starring the Mad Prophet
of the Airways, Howard Beale!

954
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:24,361
Edward George Ruddy died today!

955
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,024
Edward George Ruddy
was the chairman of the board...

956
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:29,761
of the Union Broadcasting Systems...

957
01:03:29,835 --> 01:03:33,293
and he died at 11:00 this morning
of a heart condition.

958
01:03:33,372 --> 01:03:36,671
Woe is us!
We're in a lot of trouble!

959
01:03:40,145 --> 01:03:45,082
So, a rich little man
with white hair died.

960
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:48,649
What does that got to do
with the price of rice, right?

961
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:50,746
And why is that woe to us?

962
01:03:52,691 --> 01:03:54,784
Because you people...

963
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:58,853
and 62 million other Americans
are listening to me right now.

964
01:03:58,931 --> 01:04:02,697
Because less than three percent
of you people read books.

965
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:07,799
Because less than 15 percent of you
read newspapers.

966
01:04:07,873 --> 01:04:11,639
Because the only truth you know
is what you get over this tube.

967
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:15,237
Right now, there is a whole
and entire generation...

968
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:18,511
that never knew anything
that didn't come out of this tube!

969
01:04:19,752 --> 01:04:23,984
This tube is the Gospel.
The ultimate revelation.

970
01:04:24,056 --> 01:04:26,251
This tube can make or break...

971
01:04:26,325 --> 01:04:29,055
presidents, popes, prime ministers.

972
01:04:29,128 --> 01:04:34,293
This tube is the most awesome goddamn
force in the whole godless world...

973
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:37,233
and woe is us if it ever falls
into the hands of the wrong people!

974
01:04:37,303 --> 01:04:40,602
And that's why woe is us
that Edward George Ruddy died.

975
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:44,567
Because this company is now
in the hands of CCA...

976
01:04:44,643 --> 01:04:47,271
the Communication Corporation
of America.

977
01:04:47,346 --> 01:04:50,713
There's a new chairman of the board,
a man called Frank Hackett...

978
01:04:50,783 --> 01:04:52,774
sitting in Mr. Ruddy's office
on the 20th floor.

979
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:57,117
And when the 12th largest company
in the world...

980
01:04:57,189 --> 01:05:00,625
controls the most awesome,
goddamn propaganda force...

981
01:05:00,693 --> 01:05:02,627
in the whole godless world...

982
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:06,756
who knows what shit will be peddled
for truth on this network!

983
01:05:06,832 --> 01:05:09,824
So you listen to me.
Listen to me!

984
01:05:09,902 --> 01:05:12,666
Television is not the truth.

985
01:05:12,738 --> 01:05:15,229
Television's
a goddamned amusement park!

986
01:05:15,307 --> 01:05:19,539
Television is a circus, a carnival,
a traveling troupe of acrobats...

987
01:05:19,612 --> 01:05:23,207
storytellers, dancers, singers,
jugglers, sideshow freaks...

988
01:05:23,282 --> 01:05:26,115
lion tamers and football players.

989
01:05:26,185 --> 01:05:28,653
We're in the boredom-killing business.

990
01:05:30,689 --> 01:05:34,682
So if you want the truth,
go to God.

991
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,160
Go to your gurus.

992
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:39,254
Go to yourselves!

993
01:05:39,331 --> 01:05:43,461
Because that's the only place
you're ever gonna find any real truth.

994
01:05:44,803 --> 01:05:48,967
But, man, you're never gonna get
any truth from us.

995
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:51,942
We'll tell you anything you wanna hear.
We lie like hell.

996
01:05:52,011 --> 01:05:55,037
We'll tell you that Kojak
always gets the killer...

997
01:05:55,114 --> 01:05:58,345
and that nobody ever gets cancer
in Archie Bunker's house.

998
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:00,749
And no matter how much trouble
the hero is in, don't worry.

999
01:06:00,819 --> 01:06:03,549
Look at your watch.
At the end of the hour he'll win!

1000
01:06:03,622 --> 01:06:07,080
We'll tell you any shit
you want to hear!

1001
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:10,925
We deal in illusions.
None of it is true!

1002
01:06:10,996 --> 01:06:14,989
But you people sit there,
day after day, night after night.

1003
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:19,231
You're all ages, colors, creeds.
We're all you know.

1004
01:06:19,304 --> 01:06:22,239
You're beginning to believe
the illusions we're spinning here.

1005
01:06:22,307 --> 01:06:26,107
You're beginning to think the tube is
reality and your own lives are unreal.

1006
01:06:26,178 --> 01:06:28,271
You do whatever the tube tells you!

1007
01:06:28,347 --> 01:06:30,508
You dress like the tube,
eat like the tube...

1008
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:33,710
raise your children like the tube,
even think like the tube.

1009
01:06:33,786 --> 01:06:37,313
This is mass madness, you maniacs!

1010
01:06:37,389 --> 01:06:40,119
ln God's name, you people
are the real thing!

1011
01:06:40,192 --> 01:06:42,387
We are the illusion!

1012
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:47,262
So turn off your television sets.
Turn them off right now.

1013
01:06:47,332 --> 01:06:49,323
Turn them off and leave them off.

1014
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:52,598
Turn them off in the middle
of this sentence.

1015
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:54,696
Turn them off!

1016
01:07:09,121 --> 01:07:11,988
UBS was running at a cash flow
of break-even point...

1017
01:07:12,057 --> 01:07:16,585
after taking into account $110 million
of negative cash flow from the network.

1018
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:20,223
lt was clear the fat on the network
had to be flitched off.

1019
01:07:20,299 --> 01:07:23,564
Please note an increase in projected
initial programming revenues...

1020
01:07:23,635 --> 01:07:25,694
in the amount of $21 million...

1021
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:29,434
due to the phenomenal success
of the " Howard Beale Show."

1022
01:07:30,976 --> 01:07:35,675
l expect a positive cash flow
for the entire complex of 45 million...

1023
01:07:35,748 --> 01:07:38,012
achievable in this fiscal year...

1024
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:40,677
a year, in short,
ahead of schedule.

1025
01:07:41,487 --> 01:07:43,512
Beyond that...

1026
01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:46,422
this network may be
the most significant profit center...

1027
01:07:46,492 --> 01:07:48,892
of the communications complex...

1028
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:53,091
and based upon the projected rate
of return on invested capital...

1029
01:07:53,165 --> 01:07:56,999
and if merger is accomplished,
the communications complex...

1030
01:07:57,069 --> 01:08:01,403
may well become the towering
and most profitable center...

1031
01:08:01,473 --> 01:08:04,135
in the entire CCA empire.

1032
01:08:06,145 --> 01:08:09,478
l await your questions and comments.

1033
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:11,038
Mr. Jensen?

1034
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:14,944
Very good, Frank. Exemplary.
Keep it up.

1035
01:08:40,612 --> 01:08:43,137
Buy you a cup of coffee?

1036
01:08:44,783 --> 01:08:46,341
Hell, yes.

1037
01:08:47,386 --> 01:08:49,786
Do you have to get back
to the office?

1038
01:08:49,855 --> 01:08:52,153
Nothing that can't wait.

1039
01:09:04,636 --> 01:09:08,231
l drop down to the news studios
now and then...

1040
01:09:08,307 --> 01:09:10,400
and ask Howard Beale about you.

1041
01:09:10,475 --> 01:09:13,672
He says you're doing fine.
Are you?

1042
01:09:14,413 --> 01:09:16,472
Are you keeping busy?

1043
01:09:16,548 --> 01:09:18,345
ln a fashion.

1044
01:09:18,417 --> 01:09:22,649
This is the third funeral
l've been to in two weeks.

1045
01:09:22,721 --> 01:09:27,522
l have two other friends in the hospital
whom l visit regularly.

1046
01:09:27,593 --> 01:09:30,790
l've been to a couple of christenings.

1047
01:09:30,863 --> 01:09:34,629
All my friends seem to be dying
or having grandchildren.

1048
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:37,999
You should be a grandfather yourself
about now.

1049
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,868
You have a pregnant daughter
in Seattle, don't you?

1050
01:09:40,939 --> 01:09:42,964
Any day now.

1051
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:45,566
My wife's out there
for the occasion.

1052
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:53,543
l've thought many times of calling you.

1053
01:09:55,354 --> 01:09:57,720
l wish you had.

1054
01:10:00,592 --> 01:10:04,790
l bumped into Sybil the Soothsayer
in the elevator last week.

1055
01:10:04,863 --> 01:10:07,832
l said, " You know, Sybil,
about four months ago...

1056
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:12,234
you predicted l would get involved
with a craggy, middle-aged man.

1057
01:10:12,304 --> 01:10:15,967
So far, all that's happened
has been one many-splendored night.

1058
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:19,374
l don't call that
getting involved."

1059
01:10:19,444 --> 01:10:22,880
She said,
"Don't worry. You will."

1060
01:10:25,751 --> 01:10:29,346
lt was a many-splendored night,
wasn't it, Max?

1061
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,187
Yes, it was.

1062
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:38,159
Are we going to get involved?

1063
01:10:40,766 --> 01:10:44,827
Yes. l need to become involved
very much.

1064
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:48,266
How about you?

1065
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:52,600
l've reached for the phone to call you
a hundred times...

1066
01:10:52,678 --> 01:10:55,704
but l was sure you hated me for my part
in taking your news show away.

1067
01:10:57,549 --> 01:11:00,746
l probably did.
l don't know anymore.

1068
01:11:00,819 --> 01:11:05,847
All l know is,
l can't get you out of my mind.

1069
01:11:10,162 --> 01:11:12,824
Marty, l know what NBC offered them.

1070
01:11:12,898 --> 01:11:18,598
Go to 3.5, and l want an option
for a third run on all of them.

1071
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:22,037
l'm in a big hurry, and you and Charlie
are supposed to be negotiating this.

1072
01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:24,166
Good-bye, good luck.
l'll see you Monday.

1073
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:31,204
-Jimmy Caan's agent says absolutely nix.
-You can't win them all.

1074
01:11:31,283 --> 01:11:34,741
- Where can l reach you later today?
- You can't. l'll be gone all weekend.

1075
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:44,695
NBC's offering 3.25 mil
per package of five James Bond movies...

1076
01:11:44,763 --> 01:11:47,789
and l think l'm gonna steal them
for 3.5...

1077
01:11:47,866 --> 01:11:49,959
with a third run.

1078
01:11:58,477 --> 01:12:00,638
l'm gonna stick the " Mao Tse-tung Hour"
in at 8:00...

1079
01:12:00,712 --> 01:12:05,342
because we're having a lot of trouble
selling the " Mao Tse-tung Hour."

1080
01:12:14,092 --> 01:12:18,961
That " Mao Tse-tung Hour's" turning
into one big pain in the ass.

1081
01:12:20,032 --> 01:12:23,934
We're having heavy legal problems
with the federal government right now.

1082
01:12:25,337 --> 01:12:30,274
Two FBl guys turned up in Hackett's
office and served us with a subpoena.

1083
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:36,476
They heard about our Flagstaff
bank rip-off film, and they want it.

1084
01:12:37,783 --> 01:12:40,445
Hackett told the FBl to fuck off.

1085
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,624
We're getting around the FBl...

1086
01:12:47,692 --> 01:12:51,093
by doing the show in collaboration
with the news division.

1087
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:53,461
We're standing on the First Amendment:
freedom of the press...

1088
01:12:53,532 --> 01:12:56,000
and the right to protect our sources.

1089
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:59,765
Walter thinks we can knock out
the misprision of felony charge.

1090
01:13:07,546 --> 01:13:10,879
But he says absolutely nix
on going to series.

1091
01:13:10,949 --> 01:13:16,216
They'll hit us with " conspiracy
with an inducement to commit a crime."

1092
01:13:16,288 --> 01:13:18,415
Christ, it's cold in here.

1093
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:23,086
We're paying these Ecumencial
Liberation Army nuts $10,000 a week...

1094
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:26,653
in order to turn in authentic film
of their revolutionary activities.

1095
01:13:26,731 --> 01:13:30,792
That inconstitutes
"inducement to commit a crime" ...

1096
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:34,305
and Walter says we'll all wind up
in federal prison.

1097
01:13:35,273 --> 01:13:40,336
l said, " Walter,
let the federal government sue us.

1098
01:13:40,412 --> 01:13:42,710
We'll take them to the Supreme Court.

1099
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:44,772
We'll be front page."

1100
01:13:46,384 --> 01:13:49,217
The New York Times
and the Washington Post...

1101
01:13:49,287 --> 01:13:51,221
will write editorials.

1102
01:13:51,289 --> 01:13:55,726
We'll be front page for months.
We'll have more press than Watergate.

1103
01:13:55,794 --> 01:14:00,629
All l need is six weeks
federal litigation...

1104
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:04,328
and the " Mao Tse-tung Hour" can start
carrying its own time slot.

1105
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:24,620
What's really bugging me now
is my daytime programming.

1106
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:28,352
NBC's got a lock on daytime...

1107
01:14:28,426 --> 01:14:31,156
with their lousy game shows...

1108
01:14:31,229 --> 01:14:33,823
and l'd like to bust them.

1109
01:14:33,899 --> 01:14:38,359
l'm thinking of doing
a homosexual soap opera. " The Dykes."

1110
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:42,568
The heartrending saga about a woman...

1111
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:45,940
hopelessly in love
with her husband's mistress.

1112
01:14:46,011 --> 01:14:48,138
What do you think?

1113
01:14:59,257 --> 01:15:01,384
How long has it been going on?

1114
01:15:03,895 --> 01:15:05,453
A month.

1115
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:10,630
l thought it was a transient thing,
blow over in a week.

1116
01:15:12,003 --> 01:15:16,997
l still pray to God
it's just a menopausal infatuation.

1117
01:15:18,577 --> 01:15:21,944
But it is an infatuation, Louise.

1118
01:15:23,548 --> 01:15:26,540
There's no sense in my saying
l won't see her again, because l will.

1119
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:35,253
You want me to leave,
check into a hotel?

1120
01:15:38,263 --> 01:15:40,231
Do you love her?

1121
01:15:43,668 --> 01:15:45,863
l don't know how l feel.

1122
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:51,570
l'm grateful l can feel anything.

1123
01:15:54,246 --> 01:15:56,271
l know l'm obsessed with her.

1124
01:15:58,783 --> 01:16:00,478
Then say it!

1125
01:16:01,486 --> 01:16:04,978
Don't keep telling me that
you're obsessed, you're infatuated!

1126
01:16:05,056 --> 01:16:07,524
Say that you're in love with her.

1127
01:16:10,161 --> 01:16:13,289
l'm in love with her.

1128
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:17,768
Then get out! Go anywhere you want.
Go live with her, but don't come back!

1129
01:16:17,836 --> 01:16:22,432
Because after 25 years of building
a home and raising a family...

1130
01:16:22,507 --> 01:16:26,170
and all the senseless pain
that we have inflicted on each other...

1131
01:16:26,244 --> 01:16:29,611
l'm damned if l'll stand and have you
say you're in love with somebody else!

1132
01:16:31,283 --> 01:16:36,118
This isn't the convention weekend
with your secretary, is it?

1133
01:16:36,187 --> 01:16:40,521
Or some broad that you picked up
after three belts of booze.

1134
01:16:40,592 --> 01:16:43,390
This is your great winter romance,
isn't it?

1135
01:16:43,461 --> 01:16:47,625
Your last roar of passion before
you settle into your emeritus years.

1136
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:50,793
ls that what's left for me?
ls that my share?

1137
01:16:50,869 --> 01:16:53,702
She gets the winter passion,
and l get the dotage?

1138
01:16:53,772 --> 01:16:57,367
Am l supposed to sit home
knitting and purling...

1139
01:16:57,442 --> 01:17:01,071
while you slink back
like some penitent drunk?

1140
01:17:01,146 --> 01:17:03,239
l'm your wife, damn it...

1141
01:17:03,315 --> 01:17:05,442
and if you can't work up
a winter passion for me...

1142
01:17:05,517 --> 01:17:08,714
the least l require
is respect and allegiance!

1143
01:17:21,132 --> 01:17:24,590
l hurt!
Don't you understand that?

1144
01:17:26,705 --> 01:17:29,731
l hurt badly!

1145
01:17:37,682 --> 01:17:40,048
Oh, say something for God's sake.

1146
01:17:49,794 --> 01:17:52,160
l've got nothing to say.

1147
01:18:02,774 --> 01:18:05,174
l won't give you up easily.

1148
01:18:11,616 --> 01:18:14,449
l think perhaps it is better
if you move out.

1149
01:18:20,191 --> 01:18:22,489
Does she love you?

1150
01:18:26,431 --> 01:18:30,197
l'm not sure she's capable
of any real feelings.

1151
01:18:30,268 --> 01:18:34,329
She's television generation.
She learned life from Bugs Bunny.

1152
01:18:34,406 --> 01:18:38,172
The only reality she knows
comes to her from over the TV set.

1153
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:43,970
She's very carefully devised a number
of scenarios for all of us to play...

1154
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:46,881
like a movie of the week.

1155
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:52,289
My God, look at us.

1156
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:55,656
Here we are going through
the obligatory middle-of-act-two...

1157
01:18:55,727 --> 01:18:59,686
"scorned wife throws
peccant husband out" scene.

1158
01:18:59,764 --> 01:19:03,222
But don't worry,
l'll come back to you in the end.

1159
01:19:03,301 --> 01:19:06,532
All of her plot outlines have me
leaving her and coming back to you...

1160
01:19:06,604 --> 01:19:11,268
because the audience won't buy a
rejection of the happy American family.

1161
01:19:14,112 --> 01:19:17,639
She does have one script
in which l kill myself.

1162
01:19:17,715 --> 01:19:21,913
An adapted-for-television version
of " Anna Karenina" ...

1163
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:26,217
where she's Count Vronsky
and l'm Anna.

1164
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,626
You're in for some dreadful grief.

1165
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:38,001
l know.

1166
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:41,470
The " Mao Tse-tung Hour"
went on the air March 14.

1167
01:19:41,539 --> 01:19:43,871
lt received a 47 share.

1168
01:19:43,942 --> 01:19:47,139
The network promptly committed
to 15 shows with an option for 10 more.

1169
01:19:47,212 --> 01:19:50,613
There were the usual
contractual difficulties.

1170
01:19:50,682 --> 01:19:54,277
"Equal to 20 percent except that such
a percentage shall be 30 percent...

1171
01:19:54,352 --> 01:19:57,048
for 90 minutes
or longer television programs."

1172
01:19:57,121 --> 01:19:59,919
Have we settled
that sub-licensing thing?

1173
01:19:59,991 --> 01:20:03,051
We want a clear definition here.

1174
01:20:03,127 --> 01:20:07,223
"Gross proceeds should consist of
all funds the sub-licensee receives...

1175
01:20:07,298 --> 01:20:09,493
not merely the net amount remitted...

1176
01:20:09,567 --> 01:20:12,866
after payment to the sub-licensee
or distributor."

1177
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:16,668
We're not sitting still for overhead
charges as a cost prior to distribution.

1178
01:20:16,741 --> 01:20:20,336
Don't fuck with my distribution costs!

1179
01:20:20,411 --> 01:20:22,345
l'm making a lousy 215 per segment.

1180
01:20:22,413 --> 01:20:24,904
l'm already deficiting 25 grand a week
with Metro!

1181
01:20:24,983 --> 01:20:26,917
l'm paying William Morris 10 percent
off the top!

1182
01:20:26,985 --> 01:20:29,419
l'm giving this turkey ten thousand
per segment and five to this fruitcake.

1183
01:20:29,487 --> 01:20:32,388
And, Helen, don't start
no shit with me about a piece again.

1184
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:35,255
l'm paying Metro 20 percent for all
foreign and Canadian distribution...

1185
01:20:35,326 --> 01:20:37,419
and that's after recoupment!

1186
01:20:37,495 --> 01:20:41,454
The Communist Party won't see a nickel
outta this show until syndication.

1187
01:20:41,533 --> 01:20:44,024
The Party's in for 7,500 a week
production expenses!

1188
01:20:44,102 --> 01:20:47,868
l'm not giving
this pseudo-insurrectionary a piece.

1189
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:51,966
l won't give him script approval or
cut him in on my distribution charges.

1190
01:20:52,043 --> 01:20:54,034
You fucking fascist!

1191
01:20:54,112 --> 01:20:56,945
Did you see the film we made
of the San Marino jail breakout...

1192
01:20:57,015 --> 01:21:00,109
demonstrating the rising up of a
seminal prisoner class infrastructure?

1193
01:21:00,184 --> 01:21:03,984
You can blow the seminal prisoner class
infrastructure out your ass!

1194
01:21:04,055 --> 01:21:06,717
l'm not knocking down
my goddamn distribution charges!

1195
01:21:08,259 --> 01:21:12,059
Man, give her
the fucking overhead clause.

1196
01:21:13,164 --> 01:21:15,155
Who's gonna believe this?

1197
01:21:17,569 --> 01:21:21,164
Let's get back to page 22.
Five, small " a."

1198
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:23,833
"Subsidiary rights."

1199
01:21:23,908 --> 01:21:27,469
-Where are we now?
-Middle of page 22, " Subsidiary rights."

1200
01:21:27,545 --> 01:21:31,311
"As used herein, 'subsidiary rights'
means without limitation any and all--"

1201
01:21:42,026 --> 01:21:47,089
Over the past two days, you've had
opportunity to meet Diana Christensen...

1202
01:21:47,165 --> 01:21:50,362
our vice president
in charge of programming.

1203
01:21:50,435 --> 01:21:55,134
This afternoon, you all saw some of the
stuff she's set up for the new season.

1204
01:22:04,449 --> 01:22:08,579
You all know that she is the woman
behind the " Howard Beale Show."

1205
01:22:15,226 --> 01:22:18,662
We all know she's beautiful.

1206
01:22:19,631 --> 01:22:22,464
We all know she's brainy.

1207
01:22:22,533 --> 01:22:27,493
l was thinking, before we start digging
into our chateaubriands...

1208
01:22:29,474 --> 01:22:32,068
let's show her how we feel about her.

1209
01:22:47,525 --> 01:22:50,460
We've got the number one show
in television!

1210
01:22:53,798 --> 01:22:58,167
At next year's affiliates' meeting, l'll
be telling you we've got the top five!

1211
01:23:04,509 --> 01:23:07,239
Last year, we were
the number four network.

1212
01:23:07,311 --> 01:23:09,745
Next year, we're number one!

1213
01:23:10,581 --> 01:23:12,014
We're number one!

1214
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:14,718
We're number one!

1215
01:23:25,596 --> 01:23:29,032
lt is exactly 7:00
here in Los Angeles...

1216
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:33,036
and right now over a million homes
using television in this city...

1217
01:23:33,104 --> 01:23:35,265
are turning their dials
to channel three...

1218
01:23:35,339 --> 01:23:37,933
and that's our channel!

1219
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:47,046
Howard Beale!

1220
01:23:49,954 --> 01:23:52,422
Stop it! Stop it!

1221
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:54,822
Listen to me,
and listen carefully...

1222
01:23:54,892 --> 01:23:59,420
because this is your goddamn life
l'm talking about today.

1223
01:24:00,498 --> 01:24:03,490
ln this country, when one company wants
to take over another company...

1224
01:24:03,568 --> 01:24:05,866
they simply buy up a controlling share
of the stock...

1225
01:24:05,937 --> 01:24:08,405
but first they have to file notice
with the government.

1226
01:24:08,473 --> 01:24:11,601
That's how CCA took over the company
that owns this network.

1227
01:24:11,676 --> 01:24:15,077
But now somebody's buying up CCA.

1228
01:24:15,146 --> 01:24:18,912
Somebody called
the Western World Funding Corporation.

1229
01:24:18,983 --> 01:24:21,281
They filed the notice this morning.

1230
01:24:21,352 --> 01:24:25,345
Who in the hell is
the Western World Funding Corporation?

1231
01:24:25,423 --> 01:24:28,950
lt is a consortium of banks
and insurance companies...

1232
01:24:29,026 --> 01:24:32,689
who are not buying CCA for themselves
but as agents for somebody else.

1233
01:24:32,764 --> 01:24:35,096
And who is this somebody else?
They won't tell you.

1234
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:37,396
They won't tell you.
They won't tell the Senate.

1235
01:24:37,468 --> 01:24:41,529
They won't tell the SEC, the FCC,
the Justice Department.

1236
01:24:41,606 --> 01:24:45,474
This is Mr. Hackett.
Do you have a New York call for me?

1237
01:24:45,543 --> 01:24:47,977
Do you want to
turn that down, please?

1238
01:24:48,045 --> 01:24:51,105
l will tell you who
they're buying CCA for.

1239
01:24:51,182 --> 01:24:55,346
They're buying it for the
Saudi Arabian lnvestment Corporation.

1240
01:24:55,419 --> 01:24:57,387
They're buying it for the Arabs!

1241
01:24:57,455 --> 01:25:00,481
Clarence? Frank Hackett here.
How's everything back in New York?

1242
01:25:00,558 --> 01:25:02,549
How's the good lady?

1243
01:25:05,863 --> 01:25:09,663
Take it easy.
l don't know what you're talking about.

1244
01:25:09,734 --> 01:25:12,430
When? Tonight's show?

1245
01:25:13,437 --> 01:25:15,701
Clarence, take it easy.

1246
01:25:16,908 --> 01:25:21,242
The " Howard Beale Show" is just going on
out here. You get it 3 hours earlier.

1247
01:25:21,312 --> 01:25:25,510
Take it easy! How the hell could
l see it? lt's just going on now!

1248
01:25:30,822 --> 01:25:33,689
When did Mr. Jensen call?

1249
01:25:33,758 --> 01:25:36,488
We all know that the Arabs control...

1250
01:25:36,561 --> 01:25:40,258
$16 billion in this country.

1251
01:25:40,331 --> 01:25:44,427
They own a chunk of Fifth Avenue,
20 downtown pieces of Boston...

1252
01:25:44,502 --> 01:25:49,201
a part of the port of New Orleans,
an industrial park in Salt Lake City.

1253
01:25:49,273 --> 01:25:51,537
They own big hunks
of the Atlanta Hilton...

1254
01:25:51,609 --> 01:25:54,100
the Arizona Land and Cattle Company...

1255
01:25:54,178 --> 01:25:56,510
the Security National Bank
in California...

1256
01:25:56,581 --> 01:25:58,674
the Bank of the Commonwealth
in Detroit.

1257
01:25:58,749 --> 01:26:03,186
They control Aramco, so that puts them
into Exxon, Texaco and Mobil Oil.

1258
01:26:03,254 --> 01:26:07,657
They're all over! New Jersey,
Louisville, St. Louis, Missouri.

1259
01:26:07,725 --> 01:26:12,389
And that's only what we know about.
There's more we don't know about.

1260
01:26:12,463 --> 01:26:15,830
Because all of those Arab
petrol dollars are washed...

1261
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:19,233
through Switzerland and Canada
and the biggest banks in this country.

1262
01:26:19,303 --> 01:26:23,433
For example, what we don't know about
is this CCA deal...

1263
01:26:23,507 --> 01:26:27,034
and all the other CCA deals.

1264
01:26:27,111 --> 01:26:30,774
Right now the Arabs have screwed us out
of enough American dollars...

1265
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:32,907
to come right back
and with our own money...

1266
01:26:32,984 --> 01:26:37,216
buy General Motors,
lBM, lTT, AT&T...

1267
01:26:37,288 --> 01:26:41,247
Du Pont, U.S. Steel
and 20 other American companies.

1268
01:26:41,325 --> 01:26:44,192
Hell, they already own
half of England!

1269
01:26:45,263 --> 01:26:46,730
Listen to me.

1270
01:26:46,797 --> 01:26:48,958
Listen to me, goddamn it!

1271
01:26:49,033 --> 01:26:51,126
The Arabs are simply buying us.

1272
01:26:51,202 --> 01:26:54,797
There's only one thing
that can stop them! You!

1273
01:26:55,873 --> 01:26:57,568
You!

1274
01:26:57,642 --> 01:27:00,907
So l want you to get up now.

1275
01:27:00,978 --> 01:27:03,503
l want you to get up
out of your chairs.

1276
01:27:03,581 --> 01:27:06,414
l want you to get up right now
and go to the phone.

1277
01:27:06,484 --> 01:27:09,248
l want you to get up from your chairs,
go to the phone...

1278
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:13,188
get in your cars, drive into
the Western Union offices in town.

1279
01:27:13,257 --> 01:27:16,658
l want you to send a telegram
to the White House.

1280
01:27:16,727 --> 01:27:19,195
- Oh, my God.
- By midnight tonight...

1281
01:27:19,263 --> 01:27:22,096
l want a million telegrams
in the White House!

1282
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:26,296
l want them wading knee-deep
in telegrams at the White House.

1283
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:30,773
l want you to get up right now and
write a telegram to President Ford...

1284
01:27:30,841 --> 01:27:35,642
saying " l'm as mad as hell,
and l'm not gonna take this anymore!

1285
01:27:35,713 --> 01:27:38,876
l don't want the banks
selling my country to the Arabs!

1286
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:42,351
l want the CCA deal stopped now!"

1287
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:45,048
l want the CCA deal stopped now!

1288
01:27:45,122 --> 01:27:49,058
Come on. l want the CCA deal
stopped now!

1289
01:28:12,116 --> 01:28:14,914
- Could we have the room?
- Sure.

1290
01:28:23,294 --> 01:28:27,390
l'd like to see a typed script
and run through a couple more times.

1291
01:28:27,465 --> 01:28:30,332
But as for this whole CCA deal...

1292
01:28:30,401 --> 01:28:33,768
with the Saudis, you know a lot more
about that, Frank, than l would.

1293
01:28:33,838 --> 01:28:35,806
ls it true?

1294
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:43,669
The CCA has two billion in loans
with the Saudis...

1295
01:28:43,748 --> 01:28:46,649
and they hold
every pledge we've got.

1296
01:28:47,852 --> 01:28:50,753
We need that Saudi money bad.

1297
01:28:52,923 --> 01:28:55,414
The show is a disaster.

1298
01:28:56,927 --> 01:29:00,385
Unmitigated disaster!
The death knell.

1299
01:29:01,565 --> 01:29:05,023
l'm ruined. l'm dead.
l'm finished.

1300
01:29:06,303 --> 01:29:09,898
Maybe we're overstating Beale's clout
with the public.

1301
01:29:11,308 --> 01:29:13,776
An hour ago, Clarence McElheny
called me from New York.

1302
01:29:13,844 --> 01:29:15,778
lt was 10:00 in the East...

1303
01:29:15,846 --> 01:29:20,340
and our people in the White House report
they were knee-deep in telegrams.

1304
01:29:20,418 --> 01:29:25,219
By tomorrow morning,
they'll be suffocating in telegrams!

1305
01:29:25,289 --> 01:29:27,257
Can the government stop the deal?

1306
01:29:27,324 --> 01:29:31,886
They can hold it up. The SEC could hold
it up for 20 years if they wanted to.

1307
01:29:31,962 --> 01:29:33,429
l'm finished.

1308
01:29:33,497 --> 01:29:36,227
Any second that phone's gonna ring,
and Clarence McElheny...

1309
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:40,066
is gonna tell me Mr. Jensen wants me
in his office tomorrow morning...

1310
01:29:40,137 --> 01:29:43,231
so he can personally chop my head off!

1311
01:29:44,308 --> 01:29:46,674
Four hours ago,
l was the sun god at CCA--

1312
01:29:46,744 --> 01:29:49,975
Mr. Jensen's handpicked golden boy,
the heir apparent.

1313
01:29:51,015 --> 01:29:55,145
Now, l'm a man
without a corporation.

1314
01:29:56,654 --> 01:29:59,646
Let's get back to Howard Beale.

1315
01:29:59,723 --> 01:30:03,090
You're not seriously gonna pull
Beale off the air.

1316
01:30:07,598 --> 01:30:11,694
Mr. Jensen's unhappy with Howard Beale
and wants him discontinued.

1317
01:30:11,769 --> 01:30:14,033
He may be unhappy,
but he isn't stupid enough...

1318
01:30:14,105 --> 01:30:16,938
to withdraw the number one show
on television out of pique.

1319
01:30:17,007 --> 01:30:20,568
Two billion dollars isn't pique!
That's the wrath of God!

1320
01:30:20,644 --> 01:30:22,635
And the wrath of God wants
Howard Beale fired!

1321
01:30:22,713 --> 01:30:27,878
What for? Every other network will grab
him. He'll be on the air for ABC.

1322
01:30:27,952 --> 01:30:30,819
l'm gonna impale the son of a bitch
with a sharp stick through the heart.

1323
01:30:30,888 --> 01:30:32,879
We'll lose $40 million in revenues.

1324
01:30:32,957 --> 01:30:36,916
l'll take a contract out on him.
l'll hire professional killers.

1325
01:30:36,994 --> 01:30:39,053
No, l'll do it myself.

1326
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:44,625
l'll strangle him with a sash cord.
Jesus!

1327
01:30:44,702 --> 01:30:46,897
l don't think Jensen's
gonna fire anybody.

1328
01:30:55,779 --> 01:30:58,907
Yes, Clarence.
l've already booked my flight.

1329
01:31:01,285 --> 01:31:04,118
Can you give me a little more time
than that? l've got the red-eye flight.

1330
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:07,715
l won't be back in New York
till 6:00 tomorrow morning.

1331
01:31:10,427 --> 01:31:12,588
That'll be just fine.

1332
01:31:12,663 --> 01:31:14,722
l'll see you then.

1333
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:26,699
Mr. Jensen wants to meet
with Howard Beale personally.

1334
01:31:26,777 --> 01:31:30,440
He wants Mr. Beale in his office
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1335
01:31:36,887 --> 01:31:39,822
The final revelation is at hand!

1336
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:44,054
l have seen the shattering
vulgarizations of ultimate clarity.

1337
01:31:44,128 --> 01:31:48,622
The light is impending.
l bear witness to the light!

1338
01:32:09,787 --> 01:32:12,813
Good morning, Mr. Beale.
They tell me you're a madman.

1339
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:14,448
Only desultorily.

1340
01:32:14,525 --> 01:32:16,789
- How are you now?
- l'm as mad as a hatter.

1341
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,293
Who isn't?

1342
01:32:19,363 --> 01:32:21,297
l'm taking you into
our conference room.

1343
01:32:21,365 --> 01:32:24,732
Seems more seemly a setting
for what l have to say to you.

1344
01:32:26,136 --> 01:32:28,866
l started as a salesman.

1345
01:32:28,939 --> 01:32:31,874
l sold sewing machines,
automobile parts...

1346
01:32:31,942 --> 01:32:34,775
hair brushes
and electronic equipment.

1347
01:32:34,845 --> 01:32:38,008
They say l can sell anything.

1348
01:32:38,082 --> 01:32:41,142
l'd like to try
to sell something to you.

1349
01:32:44,755 --> 01:32:46,746
Valhalla, Mr. Beale.

1350
01:32:46,824 --> 01:32:48,758
Please sit down.

1351
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:22,949
You have meddled with the primal forces
of nature, Mr. Beale...

1352
01:33:23,027 --> 01:33:25,052
and l won't have it!

1353
01:33:25,796 --> 01:33:27,286
ls that clear?

1354
01:33:27,364 --> 01:33:30,026
You think you merely stopped
a business deal.

1355
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,068
That is not the case.

1356
01:33:32,136 --> 01:33:34,627
The Arabs have taken billions of dollars
out of this country...

1357
01:33:34,705 --> 01:33:37,037
and now they must put it back!

1358
01:33:37,107 --> 01:33:42,204
lt is ebb and flow, tidal gravity.
lt is ecological balance!

1359
01:33:43,714 --> 01:33:45,648
You are an old man...

1360
01:33:45,716 --> 01:33:49,550
who thinks in terms
of nations and peoples.

1361
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:52,145
There are no nations.
There are no peoples.

1362
01:33:52,222 --> 01:33:54,383
There are no Russians.
There are no Arabs.

1363
01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:57,120
There are no Third Worlds.
There is no West.

1364
01:33:57,194 --> 01:34:02,359
There is only one holistic system
of systems!

1365
01:34:02,433 --> 01:34:06,699
One vast and immane,
interwoven, interacting...

1366
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:11,070
multi-variant, multinational
dominion of dollars!

1367
01:34:11,141 --> 01:34:14,304
Petrol dollars, electro dollars,
multi-dollars.

1368
01:34:14,378 --> 01:34:19,406
Reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds
and shekels!

1369
01:34:21,518 --> 01:34:24,419
lt is the international system
of currency...

1370
01:34:24,488 --> 01:34:29,516
which determines the totality
of life on this planet.

1371
01:34:30,394 --> 01:34:34,922
That is the natural order
of things today.

1372
01:34:35,933 --> 01:34:39,960
That is the atomic...

1373
01:34:40,037 --> 01:34:42,164
and subatomic...

1374
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:46,608
and galactic structure
of things today.

1375
01:34:48,345 --> 01:34:50,711
And you have meddled...

1376
01:34:50,781 --> 01:34:54,376
with the primal forces of nature!

1377
01:34:55,552 --> 01:35:00,148
And you will atone!

1378
01:35:01,258 --> 01:35:03,226
Am l getting through to you?

1379
01:35:07,398 --> 01:35:11,391
You get up on
your little 21-inch screen...

1380
01:35:12,936 --> 01:35:17,032
and howl about America
and democracy.

1381
01:35:18,242 --> 01:35:20,176
There is no America.

1382
01:35:20,244 --> 01:35:22,644
There is no democracy.

1383
01:35:22,713 --> 01:35:26,581
There is only lBM and lTT...

1384
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:28,311
and AT&T...

1385
01:35:28,385 --> 01:35:32,344
and Du Pont, Dow, Union Carbide...

1386
01:35:32,423 --> 01:35:33,981
and Exxon.

1387
01:35:34,057 --> 01:35:37,686
Those are the nations
of the world today.

1388
01:35:37,761 --> 01:35:40,594
What do you think the Russians
talk about in their councils of state?

1389
01:35:40,664 --> 01:35:42,222
Karl Marx?

1390
01:35:42,299 --> 01:35:44,859
They get out their
linear programming charts...

1391
01:35:44,935 --> 01:35:47,927
statistical decision theories,
minimax solutions and compute...

1392
01:35:48,005 --> 01:35:52,169
price-cost probabilities of their
transactions and investments like we do.

1393
01:35:52,242 --> 01:35:57,179
We no longer live in a world
of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale.

1394
01:35:57,247 --> 01:35:59,442
The world...

1395
01:35:59,516 --> 01:36:02,417
is a college of corporations...

1396
01:36:02,486 --> 01:36:05,387
inexorably determined...

1397
01:36:05,456 --> 01:36:08,755
by the immutable bylaws
of business.

1398
01:36:11,395 --> 01:36:14,387
The world is a business.

1399
01:36:16,233 --> 01:36:20,533
lt has been since man
crawled out of the slime.

1400
01:36:23,073 --> 01:36:27,510
And our children will live,
Mr. Beale...

1401
01:36:29,313 --> 01:36:31,304
to see that...

1402
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:35,375
perfect world...

1403
01:36:36,954 --> 01:36:40,321
in which there's no war or famine...

1404
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:42,881
oppression or brutality.

1405
01:36:44,795 --> 01:36:48,788
One vast and ecumenical
holding company...

1406
01:36:48,866 --> 01:36:53,235
for whom all men will work to serve
a common profit...

1407
01:36:53,303 --> 01:36:58,707
in which all men will hold
a share of stock...

1408
01:36:58,775 --> 01:37:01,209
all necessities provided...

1409
01:37:02,412 --> 01:37:05,904
all anxieties tranquilized...

1410
01:37:07,484 --> 01:37:10,817
all boredom amused.

1411
01:37:17,194 --> 01:37:22,029
And l have chosen you, Mr. Beale...

1412
01:37:22,099 --> 01:37:24,863
to preach this evangel.

1413
01:37:24,935 --> 01:37:26,698
Why me?

1414
01:37:27,871 --> 01:37:30,499
Because you're on television, dummy!

1415
01:37:31,808 --> 01:37:33,901
Sixty million people watch you...

1416
01:37:33,977 --> 01:37:36,810
every night of the week,
Monday through Friday.

1417
01:37:38,015 --> 01:37:40,313
l have seen the face of God.

1418
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,150
You just might be right, Mr. Beale.

1419
01:37:47,157 --> 01:37:49,182
That evening Howard Beale
went on the air...

1420
01:37:49,259 --> 01:37:52,524
to preach the corporate cosmology
of Arthur Jensen.

1421
01:37:52,596 --> 01:37:57,226
Last night l got up here and asked you
to fight for your heritage...

1422
01:37:57,301 --> 01:37:59,701
and you did,
and it was beautiful.

1423
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:02,796
Six million telegrams were received
at the White House.

1424
01:38:02,873 --> 01:38:06,206
The Arab takeover of CCA
has been stopped.

1425
01:38:06,276 --> 01:38:08,437
The people spoke, the people won.

1426
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:11,310
lt was a radiant eruption
of democracy.

1427
01:38:12,382 --> 01:38:16,341
But l think that was it, fellas.

1428
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:19,082
That sort of thing is not likely
to happen again...

1429
01:38:19,156 --> 01:38:22,182
because at the bottom
of all our terrified souls...

1430
01:38:22,259 --> 01:38:25,126
we know that democracy
is a dying giant...

1431
01:38:25,195 --> 01:38:28,426
a sick, sick, dying,
decaying political concept...

1432
01:38:28,498 --> 01:38:30,432
writhing in its final pain.

1433
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:34,266
l don't mean that the United States
is finished as a world power.

1434
01:38:34,338 --> 01:38:37,501
The U.S is the richest,
most advanced country in the world--

1435
01:38:37,574 --> 01:38:39,633
light-years ahead
of any other country--

1436
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:43,612
and the Communists won't take over the
world because they're deader than we.

1437
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,705
What is finished...

1438
01:38:47,284 --> 01:38:49,582
is the idea that this great country...

1439
01:38:49,653 --> 01:38:55,091
is dedicated to the freedom and
flourishing of every individual in it.

1440
01:38:56,193 --> 01:38:59,356
lt's the individual that's finished.

1441
01:38:59,429 --> 01:39:03,297
lt's the single, solitary human being
that's finished.

1442
01:39:04,334 --> 01:39:08,862
lt's every single one of you
out there that's finished.

1443
01:39:08,939 --> 01:39:14,002
Because this is no longer a nation
of independent individuals.

1444
01:39:15,145 --> 01:39:20,640
lt's a nation of some 200 million
transistorized, deodorized...

1445
01:39:20,717 --> 01:39:23,447
whiter-than-white,
steel-belted bodies...

1446
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,489
totally unnecessary
as human beings...

1447
01:39:26,556 --> 01:39:29,719
and as replaceable as piston rods.

1448
01:39:40,537 --> 01:39:43,904
Well, the time has come to say...

1449
01:39:43,974 --> 01:39:47,410
is " dehumanization"
such a bad word?

1450
01:39:47,477 --> 01:39:50,640
Whether it's good or bad,
that's what is so.

1451
01:39:50,714 --> 01:39:53,114
The whole world
is becoming humanoid...

1452
01:39:53,183 --> 01:39:56,311
creatures that look human
but aren't.

1453
01:39:56,386 --> 01:39:58,320
The whole world, not just us.

1454
01:39:58,388 --> 01:40:01,755
We're just the most advanced,
so we're getting there first.

1455
01:40:02,793 --> 01:40:07,025
The whole world's people
are becoming mass-produced...

1456
01:40:07,097 --> 01:40:10,032
programmed, numbered and--

1457
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:12,193
lt was an admissible argument
that Howard Beale...

1458
01:40:12,269 --> 01:40:14,703
advanced in the days that followed.

1459
01:40:14,771 --> 01:40:18,036
lt was, however,
also a very depressing one.

1460
01:40:18,108 --> 01:40:21,407
Nobody particularly cared to hear
his life was utterly valueless.

1461
01:40:21,478 --> 01:40:23,446
By the end of the first week
in June...

1462
01:40:23,513 --> 01:40:25,447
the show dropped
one ratings point...

1463
01:40:25,515 --> 01:40:28,973
and its trend of shares
dipped under 48 for the first time...

1464
01:40:29,052 --> 01:40:30,815
since last November.

1465
01:40:30,887 --> 01:40:32,878
You're his goddamn agent, Lou!

1466
01:40:32,956 --> 01:40:35,117
l'm counting on you to talk sense
into the lunatic!

1467
01:40:35,192 --> 01:40:38,127
Nobody wants to hear about
dying democracy and dehumanization!

1468
01:40:39,563 --> 01:40:41,963
l'm sorry l'm late.

1469
01:40:42,032 --> 01:40:45,627
We're getting rumbles from the agencies.
The sponsors will bail out soon!

1470
01:40:45,702 --> 01:40:47,897
This is a breach of contract!

1471
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:51,498
This isn't the Howard Beale we signed.
Get him off the corporate universe kick.

1472
01:40:51,575 --> 01:40:53,770
l'll pull him off the air!

1473
01:40:53,844 --> 01:40:56,904
l told him! l've been telling him
every day for a week!

1474
01:40:56,980 --> 01:41:00,347
l am sick of telling him!
Now you tell him!

1475
01:41:07,791 --> 01:41:09,656
Jesus Christ!

1476
01:41:13,363 --> 01:41:17,959
You could help me with Howard. He
listens to you. You're his best friend.

1477
01:41:18,034 --> 01:41:20,468
l'm tired of all this hysteria
about Howard Beale!

1478
01:41:20,537 --> 01:41:23,131
Every time you come back from seeing
somebody in your family...

1479
01:41:23,206 --> 01:41:25,504
you're in a morbid,
middle-aged mood!

1480
01:41:25,575 --> 01:41:28,908
And l'm tired of finding you on the
goddamn phone every time l turn around!

1481
01:41:28,979 --> 01:41:32,346
l'm tired of being an accessory
in your life!

1482
01:41:32,415 --> 01:41:34,815
l'm tired of pretending
to write this dumb book...

1483
01:41:34,885 --> 01:41:38,446
about my maverick days
in the early years of television.

1484
01:41:38,522 --> 01:41:42,253
Every goddamned executive fired
from a network in the last 20 years...

1485
01:41:42,325 --> 01:41:46,489
has written this dumb book about
the great early years of television!

1486
01:41:46,563 --> 01:41:49,964
And nobody wants a dumb, damn,
goddamn book...

1487
01:41:50,033 --> 01:41:52,194
about the early days of television!

1488
01:41:52,269 --> 01:41:55,261
Terrific. Maybe you can start
a whole new career as an actor!

1489
01:41:58,108 --> 01:42:02,704
After living with you for six months,
l'm turning into one of your scripts!

1490
01:42:03,713 --> 01:42:06,409
This is not a script.

1491
01:42:06,483 --> 01:42:09,816
There's some real, actual life
going on here.

1492
01:42:10,887 --> 01:42:14,379
l went to visit my wife today
because she's in a state of depression--

1493
01:42:14,457 --> 01:42:18,120
so depressed that my daughter
flew from Seattle to be with her--

1494
01:42:18,195 --> 01:42:20,527
and l feel lousy about that.

1495
01:42:20,597 --> 01:42:24,693
l feel lousy about the pain
that l've caused my wife and kids.

1496
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:29,432
l feel guilty and conscious-stricken and
those things you think sentimental...

1497
01:42:29,506 --> 01:42:33,704
but which my generation called
simple human decency.

1498
01:42:37,781 --> 01:42:40,477
And l miss my home...

1499
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:43,417
because l'm beginning
to get scared shitless.

1500
01:42:43,486 --> 01:42:46,751
Because all of a sudden it's closer to
the end than it is to the beginning...

1501
01:42:46,823 --> 01:42:50,088
and death is suddenly
a perceptible thing to me...

1502
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,720
with definable features.

1503
01:42:56,633 --> 01:43:01,468
You're dealing with a man
that has primal doubts...

1504
01:43:01,538 --> 01:43:04,405
and you've got to cope with it.

1505
01:43:04,474 --> 01:43:09,343
l'm not some guy discussing male
menopause on the " Barbara Walters Show."

1506
01:43:09,412 --> 01:43:12,643
l'm the man that you presumably love.

1507
01:43:13,717 --> 01:43:16,777
l'm part of your life.

1508
01:43:16,853 --> 01:43:18,684
l live here.

1509
01:43:18,755 --> 01:43:20,279
l'm real!

1510
01:43:21,324 --> 01:43:24,589
You can't switch
to another station.

1511
01:43:29,032 --> 01:43:30,465
Well...

1512
01:43:32,002 --> 01:43:34,800
what exactly is it
you want me to do?

1513
01:43:38,808 --> 01:43:41,675
l just want you to love me.

1514
01:43:43,213 --> 01:43:46,580
l just want you to love me,
primal doubts and all.

1515
01:43:49,019 --> 01:43:51,579
You understand that, don't you?

1516
01:43:56,393 --> 01:43:58,623
l don't know how to do that.

1517
01:44:10,273 --> 01:44:13,003
l'll be with you in a minute, Max.

1518
01:44:18,248 --> 01:44:21,843
By the first week in July, the
"Howard Beale Show" was down 11 points.

1519
01:44:21,918 --> 01:44:23,886
Hysteria swept through the network.

1520
01:44:23,954 --> 01:44:27,014
He's a plague! He's smallpox!
He's typhoid!

1521
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:29,888
l don't want to follow his goddamn show!
l want out of the 8:00 spot.

1522
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:32,485
l've got enough troubles
without Howard Beale as a lead-in.

1523
01:44:32,562 --> 01:44:34,792
You guys scheduled me up against
"Tony Orlando and Dawn" !

1524
01:44:34,864 --> 01:44:38,425
NBC's got " Little House on the Prairie."
ABC's got " The Bionic Woman."

1525
01:44:38,501 --> 01:44:41,368
You gotta do something
about Howard Beale!

1526
01:44:41,438 --> 01:44:43,633
Get him off the air!
Get him off!

1527
01:44:43,707 --> 01:44:45,800
Do something! Do anything!

1528
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:49,743
We're trying to find a replacement! l'm
going to look at audition footage now!

1529
01:44:49,813 --> 01:44:53,476
And how when the sick heal!

1530
01:44:53,550 --> 01:44:56,542
Man, l tell you l saw it!

1531
01:44:56,619 --> 01:45:00,180
lt was heavy, baby.

1532
01:45:00,256 --> 01:45:02,520
l saw the earth quake...

1533
01:45:02,592 --> 01:45:06,528
and l saw the moon became like blood.

1534
01:45:06,596 --> 01:45:10,828
And every mountain and island
was moved from its place.

1535
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:14,893
No, no, damn it! lf we wanted hell-fire,
we'd get Billy Graham!

1536
01:45:14,971 --> 01:45:18,566
We don't want faith healers, evangelists
or Oberammergau passion players!

1537
01:45:18,641 --> 01:45:23,010
What about that terrific new messiah
ABC was to sign for our competition?

1538
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,513
That's him.

1539
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:30,178
That's him?

1540
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:33,455
Jesus. Turn him off!

1541
01:45:34,624 --> 01:45:38,253
l've got three more,
but you've already seen the best ones.

1542
01:45:38,328 --> 01:45:40,296
l've got a guru from Spokane...

1543
01:45:40,363 --> 01:45:43,196
and two more hell-fires
who see visions of the Virgin Mary.

1544
01:45:43,266 --> 01:45:47,202
We're not gonna find a replacement
for Beale. Let's stop kidding ourselves.

1545
01:45:47,270 --> 01:45:50,364
Fully-fledged messiahs
don't come in bunches.

1546
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,637
We either go with Howard Beale
or we go without him.

1547
01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:56,645
My reports say we'll do better
without him.

1548
01:45:56,713 --> 01:45:59,648
lt would be disaster to let
this situation go on another week.

1549
01:45:59,716 --> 01:46:02,446
By then he'll be down 16 points...

1550
01:46:02,519 --> 01:46:05,317
and the trend irreversible,
if it isn't already.

1551
01:46:07,223 --> 01:46:10,283
l think we should fire Howard.

1552
01:46:12,962 --> 01:46:16,398
Arthur Jensen has taken
a strong personal interest...

1553
01:46:16,466 --> 01:46:18,457
in the " Howard Beale Show."

1554
01:46:20,703 --> 01:46:22,694
l'm having dinner with him tonight.

1555
01:46:22,772 --> 01:46:26,674
Let me have another crack at Jensen.
Meet in my office at 10:00 tonight.

1556
01:46:26,743 --> 01:46:29,541
Diana, give me copies of all
your audience research reports.

1557
01:46:29,612 --> 01:46:31,773
l may need them for Jensen.

1558
01:46:31,848 --> 01:46:34,112
ls 10:00 convenient for everyone?

1559
01:47:05,515 --> 01:47:09,975
l think the time has come
to reevaluate our relationship, Max.

1560
01:47:11,054 --> 01:47:12,851
So l see.

1561
01:47:14,557 --> 01:47:16,991
l don't like the way this script of ours
is turning out.

1562
01:47:18,094 --> 01:47:20,722
lt's turning into a seedy little drama.

1563
01:47:20,797 --> 01:47:25,257
Middle-aged man leaves wife and family
for young, heartless woman, goes to pot.

1564
01:47:25,335 --> 01:47:28,236
"The Blue Angel" with Marlene Dietrich
and Emil Jannings.

1565
01:47:28,304 --> 01:47:31,034
- l don't like it.
- So you're gonna cancel the show.

1566
01:47:31,107 --> 01:47:33,371
- Right.
- Let me do that.

1567
01:47:35,011 --> 01:47:37,844
The simple fact is, Max...

1568
01:47:37,914 --> 01:47:40,246
that you're a family man.

1569
01:47:40,316 --> 01:47:43,843
lt's beautiful you like a home and kids,
but l am incapable of such commitment.

1570
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,480
All you'll get from me is another
couple of months of intermittent sex...

1571
01:47:46,556 --> 01:47:50,424
and recriminate and ugly little scenes
like the one we had last night.

1572
01:47:50,493 --> 01:47:54,486
l'm sorry for all those things
l said to you last night.

1573
01:47:54,564 --> 01:47:56,964
You're not the worst fuck
l've ever had.

1574
01:47:57,033 --> 01:47:59,433
Believe me, l've had worse.

1575
01:48:01,237 --> 01:48:04,900
You don't puff or snorkel
and make death-like rattles.

1576
01:48:04,974 --> 01:48:07,465
As a matter of fact,
you're rather serene in the sack.

1577
01:48:08,978 --> 01:48:11,913
Why is it that a woman always thinks
that the most savage thing...

1578
01:48:11,981 --> 01:48:15,849
she can say to a man
is to impugn his cocksmanship?

1579
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:20,754
l'm sorry l impugned your cocksmanship.

1580
01:48:20,823 --> 01:48:25,385
l gave up comparing genitals
back in the schoolyard.

1581
01:48:34,837 --> 01:48:37,601
You're being docile as hell
about this.

1582
01:48:38,641 --> 01:48:41,735
Hell, Diana, l knew it was over
with us weeks ago.

1583
01:48:42,779 --> 01:48:45,509
Will you go back to your wife?

1584
01:48:47,183 --> 01:48:49,981
l'll give it a try,
but l don't think she'll jump at it.

1585
01:48:50,053 --> 01:48:52,021
Don't worry about me.

1586
01:48:52,088 --> 01:48:54,750
l'll manage. l always have,
l always will.

1587
01:48:54,824 --> 01:48:56,883
l'm more concerned about you.

1588
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,451
You're not the boozer type.

1589
01:48:59,529 --> 01:49:03,488
So l figure a year, maybe two,
before you crack up...

1590
01:49:03,566 --> 01:49:06,160
or jump out of
your 14th floor office window.

1591
01:49:06,236 --> 01:49:09,399
Stop selling, Max.
l don't need you.

1592
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:24,713
l don't want your pain! l don't want
your menopausal decay and death!

1593
01:49:24,787 --> 01:49:27,119
- l don't need you, Max! Get out!
- You need me!

1594
01:49:28,057 --> 01:49:32,994
You need me badly! Because l'm
your last contact with human reality.

1595
01:49:33,062 --> 01:49:35,155
l love you!

1596
01:49:35,231 --> 01:49:39,133
And that painful, decaying love
is the only thing between you...

1597
01:49:39,202 --> 01:49:42,000
and the shrieking nothingness
you live the rest of the day.

1598
01:49:42,071 --> 01:49:44,005
Then don't leave me.

1599
01:49:47,043 --> 01:49:48,977
lt's too late.

1600
01:49:50,213 --> 01:49:52,545
There's nothing left in you
that l can live with.

1601
01:49:55,885 --> 01:50:00,481
You're one of Howard's humanoids.
lf l stay with you, l'll be destroyed.

1602
01:50:02,225 --> 01:50:05,126
Like Howard Beale was destroyed.

1603
01:50:05,194 --> 01:50:08,459
Like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed.

1604
01:50:08,531 --> 01:50:13,696
Like everything you and the institution
of television touch is destroyed.

1605
01:50:20,143 --> 01:50:22,236
You're television incarnate.

1606
01:50:23,813 --> 01:50:26,077
lndifferent to suffering...

1607
01:50:26,883 --> 01:50:29,010
insensitive to joy.

1608
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:34,354
All of life is reduced
to the common rubble of banality.

1609
01:50:37,994 --> 01:50:40,462
War, murder, death...

1610
01:50:41,731 --> 01:50:44,598
are all the same to you
as bottles of beer.

1611
01:50:45,635 --> 01:50:49,594
And the daily business of life
is a corrupt comedy.

1612
01:50:51,374 --> 01:50:54,707
You even shatter the sensations
of time and space...

1613
01:50:54,777 --> 01:50:59,305
into split seconds
and instant replays.

1614
01:51:03,086 --> 01:51:05,054
You're madness, Diana.

1615
01:51:06,889 --> 01:51:08,789
Virulent madness.

1616
01:51:11,294 --> 01:51:14,354
And everything you touch
dies with you.

1617
01:51:18,901 --> 01:51:21,734
But not me.

1618
01:51:21,804 --> 01:51:24,295
Not as long as l can feel pleasure...

1619
01:51:25,641 --> 01:51:27,233
and pain...

1620
01:51:31,314 --> 01:51:32,838
and love.

1621
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:46,390
And it's a happy ending.

1622
01:51:47,764 --> 01:51:51,461
Wayward husband
comes to his senses...

1623
01:51:51,534 --> 01:51:53,695
returns to his wife...

1624
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:56,739
with whom he's established
a long and sustaining love.

1625
01:51:58,074 --> 01:52:01,976
Heartless young woman left alone
in her arctic desolation.

1626
01:52:05,148 --> 01:52:07,139
Music up with a swell.

1627
01:52:10,186 --> 01:52:11,915
Final commercial.

1628
01:52:14,724 --> 01:52:18,216
And here are a few scenes
from next week's show.

1629
01:52:30,337 --> 01:52:32,271
How'd it go?

1630
01:52:48,755 --> 01:52:53,454
Mr. Jensen was unhappy at the idea
of taking Howard Beale off the air.

1631
01:52:54,761 --> 01:52:56,956
Mr. Jensen thinks Howard Beale
is bringing...

1632
01:52:57,030 --> 01:53:00,830
a very important message
to the American people.

1633
01:53:03,136 --> 01:53:06,503
So he wants Howard Beale on the air,
and he wants him kept on.

1634
01:53:08,675 --> 01:53:11,940
Mr. Jensen feels we're too catastrophic
in our thinking.

1635
01:53:12,012 --> 01:53:14,503
l argued that television
was a volatile industry...

1636
01:53:14,581 --> 01:53:18,415
in which success and failure
were determined week by week.

1637
01:53:19,453 --> 01:53:22,354
Mr. Jensen said he did not like
volatile industries...

1638
01:53:22,422 --> 01:53:26,153
and suggested with a certain
sinister silkiness...

1639
01:53:27,627 --> 01:53:31,222
that volatility in business
usually reflected bad management.

1640
01:53:32,532 --> 01:53:35,501
He didn't really care if Howard Beale
was the number one show or the 50th.

1641
01:53:35,569 --> 01:53:38,060
He didn't really care
if the Beale show lost money.

1642
01:53:39,206 --> 01:53:41,800
He wants Howard Beale on the air...

1643
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:44,105
and he wants him kept on.

1644
01:53:44,177 --> 01:53:48,307
l would describe his position on this
as inflexible.

1645
01:53:50,217 --> 01:53:52,185
Where does that put us, Diana?

1646
01:53:53,286 --> 01:53:56,847
That puts us in the shithouse.
That's where that puts us.

1647
01:53:59,626 --> 01:54:02,527
Do you want me to go through this?

1648
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:07,430
The Beale show Q score
is down to 33.

1649
01:54:08,535 --> 01:54:12,062
Most of this loss occurred in the child
and teen and 18-34 categories...

1650
01:54:12,139 --> 01:54:14,972
which were our key core markets.

1651
01:54:16,143 --> 01:54:18,805
lt's the AR department's carefully
considered judgment, and mine...

1652
01:54:18,879 --> 01:54:23,509
that if we get rid of Beale, we should
maintain a respectable share...

1653
01:54:23,583 --> 01:54:25,778
with a comparable Q level.

1654
01:54:25,852 --> 01:54:29,344
The other show segments, Sybil the
Soothsayer, Jim Webbing, Vox Populi...

1655
01:54:29,423 --> 01:54:32,483
have all developed
their own audiences.

1656
01:54:32,559 --> 01:54:37,121
Our AR reports show that it is Beale
that is the destructive force here.

1657
01:54:38,331 --> 01:54:40,697
Minimally, we're talking about...

1658
01:54:40,767 --> 01:54:43,759
a ten-point differential in shares.

1659
01:54:43,837 --> 01:54:45,805
l think Joe oughta spell it out
for us.

1660
01:54:47,808 --> 01:54:50,902
A 28 share
is 80,000 dollar minutes.

1661
01:54:50,977 --> 01:54:53,673
l think we can sell complete positions
on the whole.

1662
01:54:53,747 --> 01:54:56,443
As a matter of fact, we're just getting
into the pre-Christmas gift-sellers...

1663
01:54:56,516 --> 01:55:00,111
and the agencies are coming back to me
with four-dollar CPMs.

1664
01:55:00,187 --> 01:55:05,215
lf that's any indication, we're talking
$40-$45 million loss in annual revenues.

1665
01:55:05,292 --> 01:55:08,523
- Want the flak from the affiliates?
- We know all about it, Herb.

1666
01:55:08,595 --> 01:55:12,326
You would describe Mr. Jensen's position
on Beale as inflexible?

1667
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:15,300
lntractable and adamantine.

1668
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:20,367
What do we do about this Beale
son of a bitch?

1669
01:55:22,542 --> 01:55:24,806
l suppose we'll have to kill him.

1670
01:55:27,681 --> 01:55:30,650
l don't suppose you have any ideas
on that, Diana?

1671
01:55:34,121 --> 01:55:35,554
Well...

1672
01:55:37,424 --> 01:55:40,120
what would you fellas say
to an assassination?

1673
01:55:42,028 --> 01:55:44,588
l think l can get
the Mao Tse-tung people...

1674
01:55:44,664 --> 01:55:47,258
to kill Beale for us
as one of their shows.

1675
01:55:48,368 --> 01:55:53,032
ln fact, it'll make a hell of
a kick-off show for the season.

1676
01:55:53,106 --> 01:55:56,041
We're facing heavy opposition on the
other networks for Wednesday nights...

1677
01:55:56,109 --> 01:55:59,567
and the " Mao Tse-tung Hour"
could use a sensational opener.

1678
01:56:01,815 --> 01:56:05,444
lt could be done right on camera
in the studio.

1679
01:56:07,087 --> 01:56:09,317
We oughta get a fantastic
look-in audience...

1680
01:56:09,389 --> 01:56:12,517
for the assassination of Howard Beale
as our opening show.

1681
01:56:13,593 --> 01:56:16,289
lf Beale dies...

1682
01:56:16,363 --> 01:56:20,459
what would our continuing obligation
to the Beale Corporation be?

1683
01:56:20,534 --> 01:56:23,594
l know our contract with Beale
contains a buy-out clause...

1684
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:25,865
triggered by his death
or incapacity.

1685
01:56:25,939 --> 01:56:29,375
There must be a formula for
the computation of the purchase price.

1686
01:56:29,442 --> 01:56:33,435
Offhand, l think it was based on
a multiple of 1975 earnings...

1687
01:56:33,513 --> 01:56:37,313
with a base period in 1975,
which l think was 50 percent...

1688
01:56:37,384 --> 01:56:40,217
of salary, plus 25 percent
of the first year's profit...

1689
01:56:40,287 --> 01:56:43,415
multiplied by the unexpired portion
of the contract.

1690
01:56:43,490 --> 01:56:45,390
l don't think the show...

1691
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:48,018
has any substantial syndication value,
would you say, Diana?

1692
01:56:48,094 --> 01:56:50,062
Syndication profits are minimal.

1693
01:56:51,231 --> 01:56:54,029
We're talking about a capital crime.

1694
01:56:55,068 --> 01:56:57,832
The network can't be implicated.

1695
01:57:08,215 --> 01:57:12,413
l hope you don't have any hidden
tape machines in this office, Frank.

1696
01:57:14,521 --> 01:57:17,513
The issue is,
shall we kill Howard Beale or not?

1697
01:57:17,591 --> 01:57:20,185
l'd like to hear
some more opinions on that.

1698
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:23,718
l don't see we have any option.
Let's kill the son of a bitch.

1699
01:57:23,797 --> 01:57:25,458
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it!

1700
01:57:25,532 --> 01:57:27,261
How do you feel?

1701
01:57:27,334 --> 01:57:28,995
We're mad as hell...

1702
01:57:29,069 --> 01:57:31,799
and we're not gonna
take this anymore!

1703
01:57:31,871 --> 01:57:35,637
Ladies and gentlemen, the " Network
News Hour" with Sybil the Soothsayer...

1704
01:57:39,212 --> 01:57:43,546
Jim Webbing and his
lt's-the-Emmes-Truth Department.

1705
01:57:45,919 --> 01:57:49,980
Miss Mata Hari
and her skeletons in the closet.

1706
01:57:52,425 --> 01:57:54,689
Tonight another segment
of " Vox Populi."

1707
01:57:59,499 --> 01:58:03,868
And starring the Mad Prophet
of the Airways, Howard Beale!

1708
01:58:23,423 --> 01:58:27,860
...network news anchorman
on the UBS " Network News Show" ...

1709
01:58:27,927 --> 01:58:31,886
known to millions
as the Mad Profit of the Airwaves...

1710
01:58:31,965 --> 01:58:35,731
was shot to death tonight in
a fusillade of automatic rifle fire...

1711
01:58:35,802 --> 01:58:38,032
just as he began
this evening's broadcast.

1712
01:58:38,104 --> 01:58:41,562
We never compromise,
so why should you?

1713
01:58:41,641 --> 01:58:45,042
Canada Dry Mixers.
Why compromise?

1714
01:58:45,111 --> 01:58:48,740
Have you seen the other side
of where you live?

1715
01:58:48,815 --> 01:58:52,649
- What's this stuff?
- Some cereal. lt's good for you.

1716
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:55,620
- Did you try it?
- l'm not gonna try it. You try it.

1717
01:58:55,689 --> 01:58:58,157
l'm not gonna try it.

1718
01:58:58,224 --> 01:59:00,215
- Let's get Mikey to try it!
- Yeah!

1719
01:59:00,293 --> 01:59:02,261
He won't eat it.
He hates everything.

1720
01:59:02,329 --> 01:59:06,288
The extraordinary incident occurred in
full view of his millions of viewers.

1721
01:59:06,366 --> 01:59:10,803
The assassins were members of
the Ecumenical Liberation Army...

1722
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:12,997
two of whom were apprehended.

1723
01:59:13,073 --> 01:59:16,941
The leader of the group known
as the Great Ahmed Khan escaped.

1724
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:19,478
This was the story of Howard Beale...

1725
01:59:19,546 --> 01:59:23,812
the first known instance of a man who
was killed because he had lousy ratings.
