1
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,789
NASA scientists are excited
over recent findings by the Mars Rover

2
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,196
of fossilised organic compounds
on the surface that indicate

3
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,870
at some time in the past there
may have been life on the red planet.

4
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,754
Thank you.

5
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,351
Was it really that hard?

6
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,153
Every day with the trash!
What is the big deal?

7
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,919
Well, can you imagine
what the world would look like

8
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,475
- if nobody took out the trash?
- Yeah, it would be awesome.

9
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,592
And speaking of trash,
have you cleaned your room yet?

10
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,835
And don`t forget to shut the door.

11
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,190
Milo, sweetie, can you get that?

12
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,636
I have to do everything around here.

13
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,792
Stromboli`s Slave Shack,
captive 331 speaking.

14
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,719
- Hey, stinker.
- Dad! Hey, are you almost home?

15
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,309
Because the movie starts at five, and
then it starts again at seven, and l...

16
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,112
Hold on. Slow down. Slow down.

17
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,037
I don`t think I`m gonna
make it back in time.

18
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,239
Well, you can`t miss the beginning.

19
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,077
That`s when the vampires take
over the submarine...

20
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,715
No, I know. I know. But...
Iooks like my flight`s cancelled.

21
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,228
And no one`s flying till
this weather lets up.

22
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,430
I`m really sorry, Milo.

23
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,630
I`ll make it home as soon as I can.

24
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,752
- I love you.
- OK. Bye.

25
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,795
- Hi, honey. What`s up?
- Stuck at the airport.

26
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,912
That`s too bad. Milo was
really looking forward to...

27
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,554
- I was looking forward to taking him.
- Yeah, I know.

28
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,919
I`m sorry.

29
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,236
Well, maybe if he
finishes all his dinner

30
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,670
he could watch Zombie Dawn III
on pay-per-view.

31
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,630
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

32
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,118
You didn`t eat your broccoli.

33
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,998
Broccoli makes me barf.

34
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,519
Besides, it looks like brains.

35
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,950
Well, you like zombies.
Zombies eat brains.

36
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,151
Mom, no one likes zombies.
They`re an abomination.

37
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,758
I`m committed to their annihilation.

38
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,918
OK. Well, no broccoli, no TV.

39
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,594
Milo!

40
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,432
Come over here.

41
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,838
- Is that broccoli?
- No. That`s vomit,

42
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,429
- but I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.

43
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,272
Well, you`re not gonna make me
eat it now, are you?

44
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,756
- Go to bed.
- But you said I could watch...

45
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,270
No. That was before you lied
to me and poisoned the cat!

46
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,912
- That broccoli was poisonous?
- No!

47
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,076
Of course the broccoli
wasn`t poisonous.

48
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,997
- Well, you just said that...
- No!

49
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,315
I meant that it`s
poisonous to the cat.

50
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,794
Well, how can it be good for me
if it`s poisonous to the cat?

51
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,071
Because cats are not
supposed to eat vegetables.

52
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,792
Maybe l`m not
supposed to eat vegetables.

53
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,035
Milo! Just go to bed.

54
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,835
Now.

55
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,796
I thought I told you to go to bed!

56
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,798
You told me to go to bed.
You didn`t say get into bed.

57
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,353
- lt`s not specific.
- Milo!

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,039
My life would be so much better
if I didn`t have to be a nagging mom.

59
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,913
Yeah, well, my life would be so much
better if I didn`t have a mom at all.

60
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,390
Cujo. Wake up.

61
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,351
I can`t sleep.

62
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,951
I shouldn`t have said
what I said, should l?

63
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,392
It wasn`t a good thing to say.

64
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,435
I feel really bad about it.

65
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,514
I should go tell her l`m sorry.

66
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,270
Right? I`m gonna go
tell her l`m sorry. Right now.

67
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,234
Mom? Are you still up?

68
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,271
`Cause I wanted to tell you that...

69
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,274
Mom?

70
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,069
Mom?

71
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,552
Milo...?

72
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,469
Mom?

73
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,549
Mom!

74
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,389
Mom?

75
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,349
Mom!

76
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,911
Let her go! Let her go!

77
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,039
Let her go!
Let her go!

78
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,229
Mom!

79
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,394
Let me go!

80
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,753
Hey! I`m... I`m caught in here!
Let me...

81
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,874
Wow! I`m in a spaceship!

82
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,233
This is so cool!

83
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,991
Did I get super powers?

84
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,431
Hello? Is anyone there?

85
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,715
Hello?

86
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,389
What`s going on?

87
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,669
Low gravity!

88
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,754
Keep it together!

89
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,672
Jump down chute number three.

90
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,557
What? Who`s there?

91
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,078
Hey, keep it quiet,
and jump down chute number three!

92
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,038
You want me to jump in there?

93
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,549
Why?

94
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,239
Jump down chute number three!

95
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,633
Just jump down the chute!

96
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,878
Relax, it`s like... a water slide...

97
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,756
...without the water!
Or the slide.

98
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,352
A world of trash!

99
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,398
It is awesome.

100
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,075
Zombies!

101
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,959
Don`t come any closer!
I`m warning you!

102
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,353
I know karate!

103
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,393
Well, at least on the Wii.

104
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,115
No! I don`t... I don`t...
I don`t want any trouble.

105
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,798
I`m just trying to find my mom.

106
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,430
- I want to find my mom.
- Mom?

107
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,550
Don`t you understand? My mom.

108
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,559
- Mom? Mom!
- Yeah, my mom.

109
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,149
No, my mom. She`s the one
that feeds me. She feeds me...

110
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,194
- Feem? Feem?
- Yeah, my mom. She feeds me.

111
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,237
No, no, she... she...
she washes my clothes.

112
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,589
She washes my clothes.
You know, my...

113
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,790
No, my... No, she... she...

114
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,636
My mom. She vacuums the house.

115
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,398
You know, she vacuums the house.

116
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,514
Yeah, she`s the one...

117
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,794
No.

118
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,550
No. No, that`s not it.
Stop. No! My... my mom.

119
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,477
She`s the one that...
She tucks me in at night.

120
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,632
She tucks me in? My mom?

121
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,953
Can you... can you...?

122
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,429
No. No!

123
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,675
No, you can`t...
What are you doing?!

124
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,278
Let go of me.

125
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,231
OK. All right. Chill out, Chachi.

126
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,316
You seriously don`t want to get
dropped right now.

127
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,873
You!

128
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,150
You sent me down a
trash chute, you jerk!

129
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,829
Yeah. Sit back,
relax and enjoy the ride.

130
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,434
Prepare to disembark the aircraft.
Let him down easy, TwoCat.

131
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,236
- Hello?
- You like video games, man?

132
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,271
Check it out. Space flight simulator.

133
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,637
I programmed it from the manual
so it`s just like the real thing.

134
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,118
I`m just messing with you.
Hey, brother!

135
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,072
Yeah. You`re not a Martian.
You`re a kid.

136
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,113
Man, it`s been so long since
l`ve seen another kid.

137
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,589
Hey!

138
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,074
I`m excited, too, buddy.
My name is Gribble.

139
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,588
Gribble the First.
What`s your handle?

140
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,676
No, wait, let me guess. Maverick.

141
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,438
- No.
- Wolfman?

142
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,469
- No.
- lceman.

143
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,519
- No.
- Did you see Top Gun?

144
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,633
- lt`s Milo.
- Milo. How low can you go, Milo?

145
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,274
How `bout I call you ``My Bro``?
Check it.

146
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,591
You`re a person...

147
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,517
- ...from Earth!
- Shut up!

148
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,152
What, are you crazy?

149
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,317
I`m part of Ronald Reagan`s
secret astronaut programme.

150
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,794
The Secronauts.
You might have heard of us.

151
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,229
We`re here to stop the threat
of interplanetary Communism

152
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,759
throughout the galaxy.

153
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,519
Why else do you think
they call it ``the Red Planet``?

154
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,351
I do crazy stuff like
that all the time, man.

155
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,231
You`re gonna have so much fun here.

156
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,068
It`s wobbly and shaky here.

157
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,596
Come on! I wanna show you something.

158
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,437
You gotta move pretty fast
to keep up with me, buddy.

159
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,072
- Wait.
- Come on down!

160
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,713
Hey, check my room out, bro!

161
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,159
Oh, man.

162
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,475
You`re not used to the low gravity yet?

163
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,636
OK, OK, OK. Don`t worry, man.
I can totally fix that.

164
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,673
I can fix anything.
There we go. I got an extra.

165
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,472
Listen, I just wanna try
and find my mom.

166
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,589
This`ll hold you down.

167
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,359
- What is it?
- Right here. OK? I`m gonna patent it,

168
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,597
call it the Gribblemeister 3000.
It`s working, right? That`s awesome.

169
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,394
I wanna show you something cool.

170
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,158
- What?
- Hold on tight. Banzai!

171
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,799
The weight belt helping you?

172
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,269
Check this out, man.

173
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,312
They`re trying to figure out
how you escaped. Watch this.

174
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,829
Oh, my word! I cannot get out! Help me!

175
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,475
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Watch this, watch this, watch this.

176
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,877
You wanna hear what they`re saying?
Sure you do.

177
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,354
Wait. Gribble, I wanna find my mom.

178
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,949
TwoCat! That is disgusting.
Here we go.

179
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,955
What is that?

180
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,752
- That`s a translator.
- Wait.

181
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,150
- Supervisor not likee.
- Getting off me, you Martian!

182
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,191
Unauthorised dogpile!

183
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,789
- ``Unauthorised dogpile``?
- I know. They say that all the time.

184
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,478
Come with me, man. This is so cool.

185
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,037
Hey! Come on in.

186
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,074
What do you think, bro?

187
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,716
- About what?
- About the room, bud.

188
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,751
It`s for you, man.
What do you think?

189
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,870
- For me?
- Oh, don`t mind this guy.

190
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,078
I just tried to train him to be like my
wingman, you know, but he`s useless.

191
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,678
It`s more like a wing nut.

192
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,393
Oh, gosh.

193
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,239
I`m gonna get rid of him.

194
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,157
But forget it, man. That`s all history.

195
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,475
- `Cause I got you now!
- Me?

196
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,272
- Yeah.
- What are you talking about?

197
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,197
I`m talking about you and me, bro.

198
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,755
Best buds hanging out forever.

199
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,634
Playing video games all day,
watching TV all night.

200
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,274
There`s no such thing
as too much TV, man.

201
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,435
Mom?

202
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,719
Oh, yeah.

203
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,992
Maybe there is such a thing
as too much TV.

204
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,110
- No. Wait.
- I wanna show you something in here.

205
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,912
What are they saying?

206
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,237
Subject will be terminating.

207
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,555
- Oh-four, oh-three...
- ``T erminating.`` Terminating?

208
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,238
Terminating. I love that movie.

209
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,236
Hey, you know what? Let`s go. I wanna
show you something cool, dude.

210
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,157
No, wait. Gribble, what`s going on?

211
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,998
I don`t wanna tell ya,
and you can`t make me. OK?

212
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,871
- Just forget about it.
- No, Gribble, tell me.

213
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,992
- Please!
- System overload! System overload!

214
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,952
- Tell me!
- Help! Hey!

215
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,433
- Tell me!
- Oh, my...

216
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,754
Get... Uncle! Get off!

217
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,039
Chafe-y.

218
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,509
All right.

219
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,509
All right, l`ll tell you.

220
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,279
Fact is...

221
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,759
...Mars needs moms.

222
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,990
What the heck does that mean?

223
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,435
These are hatchlings.

224
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,677
They are baby Martians,
and they pop out of the ground,

225
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,712
Iike potatoes,
every 25 years or so.

226
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,390
And the Martians, they`re terrible
at mothering, which is ironic, really,

227
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,637
since the ones running the place
upstairs, they`re all female.

228
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,558
- Can you get to the point?
- l... All right.

229
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,431
What they are good at
is building robots, right?

230
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,677
So they build these Nanny-bots
to raise the girls.

231
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,554
And each Nanny-bot gets one kid
to raise, and then it`s toast.

232
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,350
It can`t be reused after that.

233
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,550
Who knew mothering was so hard?

234
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,108
``Hard?``

235
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,029
- So why did they take my mom?
- OK.

236
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,311
They have to program the
Nanny-bots each time, right?

237
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,753
So... they find someone

238
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,190
who is really good
at controlling their own kid.

239
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,234
Hey, that`s my house.

240
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,272
And that`s me!
Are these my mom`s memories?

241
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,194
Yeah.

242
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,308
See, all these Martians care about
is order and discipline.

243
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,875
What was that one about?

244
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,195
Just tell me what they`re
gonna do to my mom.

245
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,033
All right.

246
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,639
Right up there.

247
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,712
You see, they have this
memory extraction machine.

248
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,916
It takes the discipline
out of the mom

249
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,315
and it puts it into the Nanny-bots.

250
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,395
It works on some kind of
solar-wind focusing system.

251
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,352
And when the sun rises...

252
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,719
...they extract what they need to
program the Nanny-bots, and that`s it.

253
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,239
OK? That`s it.

254
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,435
Wait. So my mom is gonna
lose all her memories?

255
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,438
Yeah, something like that.

256
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,516
No, that... that can`t happen.

257
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,994
- We`ve gotta save her!
- Well, that`s impossible,

258
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,713
- so, like, get over it and move on.
- But we`ve gotta try.

259
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,069
- We`ve gotta try!
- This, my friend,

260
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,156
is a Martian wristwatch.

261
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,272
You see the bars here?
Counts down to sunrise.

262
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,518
So you must have
about 6.93 Earth hours left.

263
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,911
Less than seven hours? That`s all?

264
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,916
Let`s say that,
for the sake of argument,

265
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,837
that we do, we disguise you.

266
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,839
And we use all this awesome spy gear

267
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,633
to guide you up to the surface.

268
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,229
Those Martians, man, they...
They`re gonna spot you.

269
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,796
They`re gonna chase you
and shoot at you and... and... and...

270
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,598
Wait a minute.

271
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,433
I think it`s a brilliant idea.

272
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,868
But you just said
they`re gonna shoot at me.

273
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,629
What? Oh, hey. What you talking about,
``shoot``? ``Shoot``? That`s crazy talk.

274
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,877
- That`s what you said.
- Who said that?

275
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,878
Someone say he`s gonna shoot at him?
What are you talking about, brother?

276
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,673
No one`s shooting at anybody.
Don`t even sweat it.

277
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,756
You trust me.
This is gonna be great.

278
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,952
No, you know what?

279
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,037
As a matter of fact,
this is gonna be...

280
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,196
...Gribbletastic. Yeah!

281
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,274
I don`t know, Gribble.
Are you sure this is gonna work?

282
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,914
Yeah, dude. It`s gonna be awesome.

283
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,111
That disguise totally rocks.
Trust me, you`re gonna blend right in.

284
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,912
Even the SISS won`t spot you.

285
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,474
The SlSS? What`s the SlSS?

286
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,556
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention them.

287
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,512
They`re the Supervisor`s
Secret Security.

288
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,835
They`re the ones
in the black uniforms.

289
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,552
But l`ll take care of them, man.
Don`t worry about it.

290
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,636
Anything else you ``forgot to mention``?

291
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,353
What? No. What`re you... Me?

292
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,632
Dude, honest lnjun, man.
We`re in this together.

293
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,075
Once he gets up top,
he`s gonna give himself away.

294
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,236
They`re gonna chase him
halfway around Mars,

295
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,793
and l`m gonna save his butt.

296
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,991
And he`s gonna be so totally grateful.
It`s gonna be so cool.

297
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,909
Give me a break.

298
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,678
OK, OK. So, it`s a... it`s a fib,

299
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,597
but it`s for his own good, man.

300
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,798
After this, he`ll stay down here,
where it`s safe.

301
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,794
OK, go ahead.

302
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,789
Dude, you march like a girl!
Which is kind of perfect.

303
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,755
There`s that bleached-prune lady again.
Who is that?

304
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,758
That`s the Supervisor.
She`s like the school lunch lady,

305
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,439
only with the power
to execute you on sight.

306
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,436
Man, Mars needs Botox.

307
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,595
Don`t mess with her.
She runs everything around here.

308
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,437
Gribble, are you seeing this?

309
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,835
Yeah, man. Those tags are so cool.

310
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,236
I don`t know who does `em,
but the Supervisor hates `em.

311
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,157
Oh, hey, look sharp, man.

312
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,592
You see that tall building up ahead?
That`s the Citadel.

313
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,551
Your mom`s up at the top.

314
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,318
You get up there and get your mom.

315
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,157
I am gonna program the ship

316
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,953
and make it repeat its last
Earth mission, and then, boom!

317
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,310
You`re through the wormhole and home
in time for Pop- Tarts. OK? Easy.

318
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,753
TwoCat, this is it, man.
They`re gonna spot him here for sure.

319
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,869
Stop it. Don`t look at me like that.

320
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,319
I`m gonna take care of him.

321
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,073
Check it out, all right?

322
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,839
When he gets to the checkpoint gate,
he`s gonna trigger the alarm,

323
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,189
the guards`ll close in,
l`m gonna press this button.

324
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,879
The cleaning hatch is gonna open, gonna
drop down to the maintenance floor,

325
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,959
where he can escape down the
trash chute. See? It`s very simple.

326
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,151
OK. It`ll all be fine.

327
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,672
But if anything, you know,
weird or unexpected happens,

328
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,631
just run like crazy, OK?

329
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,113
You see?

330
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,313
T otally in my control.

331
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,755
I pushed the wrong one.
Oh, my gosh!

332
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,597
Oh, no, no, no, no!

333
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,078
Gribble, where are they taking me?

334
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,473
OK, just give me a minute.

335
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,112
Don`t have an aneurysm.

336
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,634
Oh, man, OK, you`re going up,
and that`s not good.

337
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,832
I thought I wanted to go up?

338
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,518
Well, yes and no.

339
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,869
This is a very, very bad up.

340
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,669
OK, OK, OK... don`t panic.

341
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,756
- Get ready.
- For what?

342
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,029
How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!

343
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,392
And he`s off! Yes! Finally.

344
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,876
Gribble! Which way now?

345
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,952
- Dang, I`m good!
- Gribble!

346
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,356
I`m a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side

347
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,039
Tart-choppin`, body-poppin`...

348
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,799
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot
and tell me which way!

349
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,994
Did you just call me an idiot?

350
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,712
Which way? I`m lost here!

351
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,274
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

352
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,788
I think that you have to apologise now.

353
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,319
Gribble!

354
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,952
I`m waiting.

355
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,638
All right, all right, l`m sorry!

356
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,159
Apology accepted. Go left.

357
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,189
No, no, no, no, not that left!
Not that left, not that left!

358
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,309
Back up, man!

359
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,672
- Turn it down, Gribble!
- TwoCat, turn off your alarm!

360
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,917
What is going on here? TwoCat?

361
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,994
Oh, no. Mommy? Mommy!

362
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,598
Gribble! I need to know...

363
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,392
Gribble, come in. Are you there?

364
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,636
Gribble! Come on, Gribble, this
is no time for the silent treatment!

365
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,153
Gribble? Help me.

366
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,155
I`m trapped,
and there`s nowhere to hide!

367
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,435
Gribble!

368
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,672
If not using ropes, my friend,
you will needing wings.

369
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,513
We must cleaning paint off you
before someone is seeing you.

370
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,028
It will getting you in trouble.
Giving me your helmet...

371
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,793
The Earth hatchling!

372
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,833
Gribble! Gribble, come in. They`ve
spotted me! But I think I lost them!

373
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,515
Get off me! Let me go! Let me go!

374
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,393
Cool it! I gotta clean you up!

375
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,510
- Get off of me!
- Hey!

376
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,677
Mellow out, man!
I`m not the fuzz!

377
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,711
- l`m not bustin` you.
- You`re not?

378
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,557
Check it out!

379
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,434
What is that?

380
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,675
- They were tracking me?
- Not you.

381
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,950
They were trackin`
whoever you were chattin` with.

382
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,911
Who I was... who I was talk...

383
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,076
I was talking to Gribble! Oh, no!

384
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,314
No time! Sorry! No time!

385
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,269
You got time now?

386
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,951
This is so low temperature!

387
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,114
OK. You`re from Earth,
so you must know...

388
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,835
What do you ``turn on``?
How do you ``tune in``?

389
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,552
What do you ``drop out`` of?

390
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,271
What powers do flowers have?

391
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,950
That`s English!
Where did you learn English?

392
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,159
Two quarters ago,

393
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,236
I was working in the
administration block.

394
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,513
The Supervisor was talking
with 11 3-Elder-331.

395
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,791
They were viewing some
top-secret Earth documents.

396
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,389
When they left, I wanted to check out
what was making the weird light.

397
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,953
What`s going on here?

398
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,479
It`s a chrysanthemum, baby.

399
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,748
A chrysanthemum?

400
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,314
That`s not a chrysanthemum.

401
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,509
And it was...

402
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,509
...amazing!
So I copied all I could.

403
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,597
The way that light vibrated and sang!

404
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,473
Nothing in my world
has ever made me feel like that!

405
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,193
It was like my eyes were open
for the first time.

406
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,674
It was crazy beautiful, man.

407
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,832
This is a chrysanthemum.

408
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,197
Flower power, it`s gonna change
the world, man!

409
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,196
Yeah, that`s just groovy, man.

410
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,515
They called it...

411
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,913
Colour.

412
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,190
Your hippie alien life story
is totally interesting,

413
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,277
but l`m kinda busy
saving my mom!

414
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,157
You mean your Nanny-bot.

415
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,876
No! I mean my mom!
She`s a human being!

416
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,312
Wait. No, but...
I saw inside her headspace.

417
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,191
You said, ``My life
would be so much better

418
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,037
if I didn`t have a mom at all.``

419
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,389
I know what I said,
but I was wrong, and I do want her.

420
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,556
Heavy! Why?

421
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,955
Because she...

422
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,594
She looks after me
and she tells me what to do!

423
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,436
Oh, like the Supervisor!

424
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,993
No, not like the Supervisor!
My mom is kind.

425
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,711
She takes me to Disneyland,
and she reads to me,

426
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,274
and she makes me hot chocolate,

427
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,632
and she puts bandages on my cuts,
and she hugs me and she...

428
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,709
She loves me.

429
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,749
``Love``?

430
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,909
Chute number three.

431
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,839
Crazy.

432
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,677
Gribble? Can you hear me now?

433
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,149
Gribble?

434
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,315
Oh, no.

435
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,155
Gribble?

436
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,714
Gribble?

437
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,875
Gribble?

438
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,349
Gribble!

439
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,954
Oh, no. That`s only
five and a half hours!

440
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,273
Stupid weights.

441
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,430
``Private. Keep out.
No Martians allowed.``

442
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,994
``Gribble.``

443
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,192
``George Ribble.``

444
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,355
He must`ve been a kid, too,
when he came here.

445
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,071
Why wouldn`t he tell me?

446
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,270
TwoCat? TwoCat!

447
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,753
Hold on, buddy.

448
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,398
Are you OK?

449
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,911
Oh, here. Where`s Gribble, TwoCat?
I gotta find him!

450
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,236
He`s the only person on this entire
planet who can help me save my mom.

451
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,793
That burnt area. That`s where
they shoot people, isn`t it?

452
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,593
That`s a firing squad,
and they`re gonna shoot Gribble?

453
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,433
TwoCat, we gotta save him!

454
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,755
Ladies, ladies,
you don`t wanna do this.

455
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,631
Listen, l`m a walking A-bomb!

456
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,875
You shoot me, and the
whole planet`s gonna go up!

457
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,433
You don`t want that
on your conscience...

458
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,789
OK, seriously.
OK, you could be precipitating

459
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,879
a major interplanetary war here,
people, aliens, Martians.

460
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,831
OK, listen! I`ve been
living in your sewers for years.

461
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,871
I`m disgusting,
they`re contaminated,

462
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,388
and they need a vaccine
and l`m the only one that has it.

463
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,594
OK. Listen. You made your point.

464
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,392
I invented some great stuff!

465
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,431
I can let you in on
the ground floor, OK?

466
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,596
How `bout blue mascara?

467
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,552
I`ve got a Slinky!
A Rubik`s Cube?

468
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,068
You like Dungeons and Dragons,
I love Dungeons and Dragons.

469
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,193
How `bout skateboards?
I got millions... OK. Hey!

470
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,630
I can get you a Cabbage Patch Kid. Not
one of those gnarly ones, a real one.

471
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,557
What about a pizza?

472
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,637
You like crop circles?
I have quite a crop.

473
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,636
Oh, and l`ll teach you how to moonwalk.

474
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,749
Can`t really do it in these chains.

475
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,638
Legwarmers!

476
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,678
Wait, wait.
We`re really gonna do this?

477
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,639
Unauthorised dogpile!

478
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,076
Hey! Milo, what are you doing here?

479
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,633
I`m rescuing you.
What does it look like?

480
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,077
It`s exactly according to my plan!

481
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,475
Ki!

482
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,115
Hot, hot, hot!

483
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,390
Wait! Stop it with the shooting!

484
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,198
My toe! What are you doing?
Oh, my gosh!

485
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,438
When you`re going
to shoot a laser at someone,

486
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,756
you should bring them
a change of underwear!

487
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,237
Hairy Tribe Guys.

488
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,999
Wingnut?

489
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,350
- OK. OK. Thank you.
- Oh, come on. Let go!

490
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,838
- Let go! What are you doing?
- They`re hugging!

491
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,998
It`s all these males ever do! That`s why
the females chuck `em down here!

492
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,828
We don`t have time!
The SlSS are gonna find us!

493
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,919
- Run!
- Run!

494
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,396
Wingnut! It`s Wingnut!

495
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,556
OK. Come on! Come on.

496
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,635
What?!

497
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,150
Wingnut! No!

498
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,029
Wait!

499
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,676
Gribble!

500
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,150
Relax, Grib. Fat floats.

501
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,475
Hey!

502
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,916
Oh, nuts.
There goes my sexy tan.

503
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,552
Less than three and a half hours.

504
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,915
Echo!

505
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,350
This place is amazing!

506
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,237
It`s Gribbletastic.

507
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,398
You have got to stop saying that.
You sound Gribblediculous.

508
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,034
Hey, hey.
TwoCat`s homing in on our headsets.

509
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,996
I built him with a location device.

510
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,439
I think of everything.

511
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,116
I`m the bomb. I`m the bomb.

512
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,594
Stretch... stretch that bar
across this rock.

513
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good, good, good.

514
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,593
You know this place is perfect?
We can rebuild right over there.

515
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,675
- You see that?
- No.

516
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,711
- Keep still.
- Yeah, right, sorry.

517
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,038
Build a whole new lair.

518
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,389
Be years before we fill
this place up with our junk.

519
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,312
What do you say, pal?
You and me? Best buds?

520
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,237
You can be emperor this time.

521
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,353
And l... I shall be El Presidente.

522
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,799
Hey!

523
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,428
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this!

524
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,157
- Gimme that!
- But...

525
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,873
Maniac!
These things are dangerous!

526
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,679
Tried to blow up some trash once with
one of these, almost took my foot off!

527
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,119
Yes!

528
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,399
Oh, good, it`s nearly empty.

529
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,592
Anyway, why don`t we go rebuild
right over here. What do you think?

530
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,676
That lava slope looks
like our best way up.

531
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,358
My mom`s running out of time, Gribble.

532
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,436
- Let`s go!
- Hey, no, come on!

533
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,993
It can`t be done!

534
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,875
Did you see what happened up there?

535
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,192
Man, I nearly got toasted!

536
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,874
To death!

537
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,148
Thanks for saving me, but... I`m
never going up there again, man.

538
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,556
You... You can`t!
You can`t just bail on me now!

539
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,397
Bye.

540
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,469
George!

541
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,271
Your name`s George!

542
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,669
- What did you just call me?
- George.

543
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,309
George Ribble.

544
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,438
- You were a kid, like me!
- Where did you get this?

545
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,833
This is mine.

546
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,830
They took your mom, too, didn`t they?

547
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,270
It`s OK, Grib, I know how you feel!

548
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,118
How I feel? How I feel...

549
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,954
You have no idea how I feel.

550
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,478
You see this?

551
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,437
This is when they chose my mom.

552
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,317
But way before they chose yours.

553
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,512
I know, Gribble.
It happened to me the same way.

554
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,916
No. No, you don`t know.

555
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,352
How could you possibly know?

556
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,550
I was a good kid.

557
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,071
I did my chores.

558
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,156
Put my things away.

559
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,111
I did as I was told.

560
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,275
Turns out,
that`s exactly why they chose her.

561
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,954
`Cause of me.

562
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,917
Man. What kind of message is that
to send to a little kid?

563
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,755
I know. It`s not fair!

564
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,276
I`ll tell you what`s not fair, man.

565
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,836
Not fair is when a bunch
of scary aliens take your mama,

566
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,872
your only parent, away from you
in the middle of the night.

567
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,676
Not fair is when you follow them,
and you sneak onto their ship,

568
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,917
and you search
but you can`t find her.

569
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,916
And then you see her...

570
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,315
They got your mama strapped
into some kind of machine.

571
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,233
Mom!

572
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,473
So I grabbed a couple
of breathing helmets,

573
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,953
and I went to get her.

574
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,274
But I didn`t know what I know now.
I didn`t know...

575
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,550
...that when the sun came up,
it`d start the machine.

576
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,396
I didn`t know... what that
machine was gonna do to her.

577
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,598
Not until it was too late.

578
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,513
And then I realised...

579
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,829
...I was all alone.

580
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,550
I`d never see my mom again.

581
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,870
And l`d never be able
to tell her I loved her.

582
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,069
``Never be able to tell her you
love her...`` What do you mean?

583
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,671
No, no, you don`t have
to worry about that.

584
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,439
It`s not gonna happen.

585
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,759
Not this time.

586
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,435
Not to you.

587
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,796
We`re gonna go up there
and we`re gonna...

588
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,793
We`re gonna go get your mom.

589
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,471
Really? You mean it?

590
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,273
Yeah. You and me, buddy.

591
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,588
Best buds, right?

592
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,873
- Thank you, Gribble.
- Yeah, man.

593
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,231
Yeah, we`ll get your mom back, man.

594
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,752
``Best buds.``

595
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,437
That`s like the ``love`` thing, right?

596
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,949
My, my, my, my...

597
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,911
...my, my Sharona!

598
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,512
- No! Gribble!
- Evasive action!

599
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,349
I`m sorry.

600
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,995
- No, Gribble! Gribble, stop! Relax!
- Don`t shoot me, please!

601
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,033
Gribble, Gribble! Relax! Listen!
She`s not gonna shoot you!

602
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,798
- She`s not gonna shoot you!
- She`s not?

603
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,239
No! She`s the one
that helped us escape!

604
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,235
She is?

605
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,350
- TwoCat brought her.
- He did?

606
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,597
I used to be administration
unit 231 -Ki-312.

607
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,393
But now,
l`m down with your scene, man.

608
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,791
What is she talking about?

609
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,910
I don`t know.
She talks like that a lot.

610
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,439
But I think she wants
to help us, right?

611
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,234
Right on! Come on!
We gotta beat feet!

612
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,633
``Beat feet``?

613
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,515
Oh, you mean run! Yeah, we do!

614
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,437
- Yeah!
- All right, Gribble, let`s go!

615
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,914
- OK! Come on!
- lt`s just so weird!

616
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,074
Come on, guys!
This is the way out!

617
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,156
Is there gonna be a lot of running?

618
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,270
Psychedelic! What are they?

619
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,471
They`re paintings.
You know, like your flower graffiti.

620
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,399
Wait! Wait, wait! Ki, Ki!

621
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,717
Hold on. You`re the one...

622
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,511
...that paints those flower tags?

623
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,758
That is so bad!

624
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,195
Bad? But... but it is meant to be good.

625
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,869
No. No, no, I mean... no.
Bad means good. I just,

626
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,037
I think that...
I think that they`re amazing and...

627
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,479
I think that...
I think you`re amazing.

628
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,315
Gribble!

629
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,508
- You can change colour!
- What?

630
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,109
That is also... ``bad``.

631
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,239
What is that?

632
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,115
That? It looks like a family.
Kids and parents.

633
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,155
That`s the ``love`` thing.

634
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,354
What are ``parents``?

635
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,359
You know, people like my mom,
who look after kids like me?

636
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,550
I guess you guys had families once.

637
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,397
You know, if you Martians had parents,

638
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,273
you wouldn`t have to kidnap moms
to program your Nanny-bots.

639
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,598
- Come on.
- But...

640
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,189
But the Supervisor said that Martians
have always been raised by machines.

641
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,869
Wow, looks like she
lied to you, big time.

642
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,919
We never knew.

643
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,149
That`s the Citadel.

644
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,795
We`ve got to get to the top.

645
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,149
That`s where mission control is,
on the surface.

646
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,395
Your mom is in
the Extraction Machine here.

647
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,079
And your ride back to Earth
is in the silo here.

648
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,553
That`s all well and good, guys,

649
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,397
but I don`t think we`re
gonna make it to the Citadel.

650
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,711
Why are they checking everyone?

651
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,479
Well, you`re kind of
a celebrity now, buddy.

652
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,554
And who is that handsome devil
next to you?

653
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,189
You better keep your heads down.

654
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,879
If they bust you,
they will slap you in the joint!

655
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,196
Wait a minute. That`s exactly
where we wanna go!

656
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,276
Yeah! He`s right on!

657
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,479
What? What... Hey!
We`re going to jail?

658
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,318
No, no. When they first found me,
they brought me straight to jail.

659
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,316
The jail`s next to the silo
where they keep the spaceship!

660
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,510
- OK.
- Sub-level two. Go ahead.

661
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,791
If we can get through the jail,
and up through the silo,

662
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,434
we can get to the surface.
And that`s where Mom is.

663
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,671
Yes, but isn`t the jail
thousands of feet above us?

664
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,756
One thousand and thirty-two!

665
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,875
Wait! Wait a minute.
How strong is this line?

666
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,276
I`m a little over my
goal weight right now. Hey!

667
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,350
OK. We`ve got to take out the guards,
shut down the surveillance cameras,

668
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,233
then we can sneak through the jail
and get to the silo.

669
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,555
We catching the two terrorists.

670
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,068
Supervisor ordering we must
locking them in cells.

671
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,034
Is this gonna work?

672
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,675
- No, wait.
- No! No, please, please, no!

673
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,711
I don`t wanna go back to jail! Please!

674
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,512
No, no, please! No!

675
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,074
I need a doctor and l`ve got measles!

676
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,271
And l`ve got gingivitis!
And l`ve got male pattern baldness.

677
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,675
I will getting prisoner tranquilizers.
Where are they?

678
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,870
- Bottom left control.
- Restless leg syndrome!

679
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,194
I got Saturday Night Fever!

680
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,310
- Bat wing disorder!
- And halitosis!

681
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,318
Yes! Horrible halitosis! I do?

682
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,997
Hey! Awesome!

683
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,795
And this officially ends
today`s prison broadcast!

684
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,114
Come on! Come on! Come on! Let`s go!

685
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,872
OK, here`s the plan.
I`ll go get my mom.

686
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,273
You guys fire up the spaceship,

687
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,311
and we`ll be outta here
before they can say...

688
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,276
- Hey, Grib, what are you doing?
- lt`s Wingnut, man!

689
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,039
He`s still alive! Hey, bud.
I can`t just leave him in here.

690
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,072
OK, well, get him out,
but do it fast! We gotta go!

691
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,556
OK. Come on! This will do it.

692
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,436
Yeah! Come on out, you freakazoid!

693
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,312
I know. I know. It`s OK.

694
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,430
What`s with all the grabbing
and squeezing?

695
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,516
It`s called ``hugging``.
It`s another love thing.

696
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,836
OK, enough already.
Come on! We gotta go!

697
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,033
Man! I must have
opened up all the cells.

698
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,311
- Who let the dogs out?
- No duh.

699
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,155
What?

700
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,229
What`s going on?

701
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,238
It`s the hatchlings.
They`re sorting them.

702
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,159
Yeah. The girls are
all assigned their Nanny-bots.

703
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,191
And the boys are sent down below

704
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,708
where they`ll be raised
by the Hairy Tribe Guys.

705
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,113
These guys knew a bunch
of boy hatchlings were coming!

706
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,311
That`s why they were dancing down
in the trash. They were celebrating!

707
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,476
Yeah, but all the Hairy Tribe Guys
are up here now.

708
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,993
There`s no one down there
to take care of them.

709
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,829
The boys are gonna be all alone.

710
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,678
And to be alone is...

711
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,757
...to be without the crazy love thing.

712
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,075
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys. We gotta go!

713
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,352
Wait. Wait!
Go down the garbage chutes!

714
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,553
Listen, listen! Guys!

715
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,708
If you jump down chute number three,

716
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,751
you can save the hatchlings.

717
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,791
OK? Do you understand?

718
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,509
Chute...

719
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,919
- ...number... three!
- Come on, Grib.

720
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,520
- One, two, three!
- We gotta go! They`ll figure it out!

721
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,755
No, they won`t!
They`re dumb as a box of rocks.

722
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,952
- Ki. It`s no use.
- We gotta go!

723
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,513
Go, Wingnut!

724
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,236
On the other side of the rocket,
there`s a ladder up to the surface.

725
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,032
But how do we get past
all those Martians?

726
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,149
I can totally fix that.

727
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,110
Hey, everybody grab a helmet.
Put it on real tight.

728
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,791
Good game. Good game. Good game.

729
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,798
Here. Don`t forget that.

730
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,957
Keep in touch, kiddo.
Get up that ladder over there.

731
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,194
Good luck!

732
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,354
Wait a minute! Won`t they see me
from Mission Control?

733
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,356
No way, buddy.
They`ll be looking into the rising sun.

734
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,278
Won`t be able to see a thing. By the
time they figure out what`s going on,

735
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,788
we`ll be on the couch eating Smurf
Berry Crunch and watching He-Man.

736
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,559
- Gribble.
- Gribble.

737
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,831
Yes. And I am Ki. Remember?

738
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,836
No, I know.

739
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,440
I mean... No, I said that
because, well, you know,

740
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,995
the ship`s got this...
voice-activated launch system.

741
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,156
And I had to record a word,

742
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:43,354
and Ki just didn`t seem like a word
that would start an engine... you know?

743
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,279
Except...

744
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,556
...now that I think about it...

745
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,989
...``Ki`` is like a perfect word
to start an engine

746
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,830
because it`s, you know, used to...

747
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,717
...unlock things like...

748
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,712
...my heart.

749
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,194
I dig it when you change colour.

750
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,600
Gribble! Ki! I`m halfway there!

751
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,035
Oh, no!

752
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,998
What dummy left that there?

753
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,352
Milo?

754
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,074
Gribble, I think I fell into something!

755
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,154
Gribble, come in!

756
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,831
- lt`s OK, Ki. I`ve got him.
- Greatjob!

757
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,996
- Gribble!
- Hey.

758
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,032
- That`s the second-to-last lens!
- We`re not gonna make it!

759
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,435
You wanna bet? Yeah!

760
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,195
This thing is going
on my Christmas list!

761
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,071
Guys! The SlSS are gonna
crash Mission Control!

762
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,078
They`ll be through the airlock
and on the surface any minute!

763
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,680
Oh, no! What do we do?

764
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,756
All right, take her in.

765
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,156
OK. You go save your mom.
I`ll take care of the SlSS.

766
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,553
- But, Gribble, they`re gonna...
- No, no, no.

767
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,559
My mama always said,
``Son, you gotta do the right thing.``

768
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,195
And for the first time since
I came to Mars, l`m doing it.

769
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,830
Man, I hope Ki saw that.

770
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,189
Go get `em. Fire butt blasters!

771
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,549
Mom! Mom!
Mom, wake up! Wake up!

772
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,070
Milo, can you turn the cartoons down?
I`m trying to sleep.

773
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,279
No. Mom, come on. You gotta wake up!
We gotta get out of here!

774
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,076
Milo, the alarm hasn`t even gone off.

775
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,476
Can you just let me sleep until sunrise?

776
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,112
Believe me, that would be a bad idea.

777
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:53,433
- Gribble!
- Gribble, Gribble, Gribble.

778
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,114
Oh, no! I activated the launch system.

779
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,031
Come on. We gotta get out of here.

780
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,272
Come on! Come on!

781
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,235
Come on, Mom. Come on!
We gotta go. Hurry!

782
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,794
Hurry! Mom, come on! Mom, Mom!

783
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,390
Milo? The launch system lit up.

784
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,429
I can`t cool it.

785
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,554
You got two minutes.

786
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,229
Two minutes! Mom, come on.
We gotta hurry. Mom.

787
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:29,593
Wait a second.
Did you just pull me out of bed?

788
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,234
No! Mom, Mom.

789
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,876
Mom! Mom, listen.

790
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,115
Mom, look at me. Mom, look at me.

791
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,720
Look at me. I`ll explain
everything, but later. OK?

792
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,796
- Right now we gotta get to the ship.
- The ship?

793
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,159
- The ship.
- What ship?!

794
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,715
- That ship!
- Milo! Sixty seconds.

795
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,354
- Get it on!
- Everything`s gonna be fine.

796
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,118
- OK.
- Here. Just put this on.

797
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,152
And then you gotta twist this lever
to seal the neck. See? Like this.

798
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,919
- What do you mean?
- We need air. We can`t breathe outside.

799
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,554
- There`s no air?
- Mom, it`s Mars.

800
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,637
OK. One, two, three!

801
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,398
Help!

802
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,795
Now, start running! Run!

803
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,238
Are those Martians?

804
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,750
Yeah. The hairy guys are good,
and the uniforms are bad.

805
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,032
Let`s just hope we don`t see...

806
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,998
...the Supervisor!

807
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,835
No! Mom!
You gave me your helmet?

808
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,668
No! No! Mom! No! No!

809
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,359
No! Mom! Mom!

810
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,755
No! No! No!

811
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,395
No, Mom! Mom, no! No.

812
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,079
Mommy, you have
to come home with me.

813
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,076
You have to come home with me!

814
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,031
You`re... you`re my mom...

815
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,071
...and I love you!

816
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,039
No!

817
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,275
No, no, no, no, no.

818
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,154
No!

819
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,073
Gribble! My mom!

820
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,549
Bingo.

821
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,230
Milo! I`m coming, buddy!

822
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,557
I got it. I got it.

823
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,559
Lift her head.

824
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,228
Milo. You saved me.

825
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,237
No. It was Gribble.

826
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,716
No, bro. No, it was you, man.
It was you.

827
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,549
You saved your mom, man.

828
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,874
I`m sorry for what I said before.

829
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,160
My life wouldn`t be better without you.

830
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,875
Oh, Milo. My love.

831
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,118
Milo! Gribble!
I`ve got the ship under control...

832
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,718
- Ki!
- I`m good.

833
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,672
- I can buff out the scratches.
- Come on, Mom. We gotta go.

834
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,631
- We gotta go.
- Oh, OK.

835
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,269
Stopping right there!

836
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:49,876
This is not over.
You will surrendering.

837
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,514
Hey! Surrender this!

838
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,995
Ki! What are you doing?

839
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,235
I will not letting you do this.

840
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,274
Insolence!

841
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,756
You cannot stopping this.
This is the way it has always being.

842
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,753
No. No. No!

843
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,560
This is not the way it is always being.

844
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,718
She lied to us! Look!

845
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,913
We were not meant
to being raised by machines.

846
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,350
We were meant to be raised by families.

847
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,553
By parents.

848
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,798
We were meant to having that... that...

849
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,353
That crazy love thing?

850
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,316
That crazy love thing.

851
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,549
Never!

852
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,958
You fool. I saved you!

853
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,036
Before any of you were even born

854
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,914
I realised we do not have time
to raise hatchlings.

855
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:20,636
And the males? They never helped.

856
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,240
Always dancing and playing.

857
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,670
That is why we must throw them away.

858
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,633
There must be order.
Arresting the evildoers!

859
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,635
Evildoer, you.

860
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,830
No! I did this for you!

861
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,908
I did this for all of you!
You will be sorry. Let me go!

862
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,829
So are you gonna stay?

863
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,075
Wow.

864
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,758
Wow...

865
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,070
Actually, I think l`m gonna...

866
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,951
You know, Mars is different now.

867
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,519
I`m gonna hang out with Ki and...

868
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,753
...help paint and stuff.

869
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,829
He`s really good at red.

870
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,632
Stop it.

871
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,555
So will I ever see you again?

872
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,671
What? Are you kidding me? Of course.

873
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,790
We`ll keep in touch.

874
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,957
- How?
- What do you mean ``how?``

875
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,278
I could fix it.
It`s gonna be Gribbletastic.

876
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,718
Best buds?

877
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,676
You better believe it.

878
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:53,274
Thank you, Gribble.
Your mother would be proud of you.

879
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,352
It`s my pleasure.

880
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,394
Oh, man.

881
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,879
I`m not crying. It`s allergies.

882
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,751
Silly.

883
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,398
- Bye! Goodbye!
- Bye.

884
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,071
Bye!

885
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,671
I love you, Milo.

886
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,160
I know that... now.

887
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:23,271
- Dad!
- Hi, stinker.

888
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,557
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

889
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,870
Did something happen
to Milo this weekend?

890
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,029
Colour.

891
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:35,954
Flower power is gonna
change the world, man!

892
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,196
- Mark.
- No, that`s vomit.

893
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:59,028
- But I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.

894
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,911
Well, you`re not gonna
make me eat it now, are you?

895
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,309
Mom!

896
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,596
My mom. She... she vacuums the house.

897
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,437
You know, she vacuums the house. My...

898
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,879
Yeah, she`s the one.
Yeah, that... No.

899
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,392
I`m just messing with you.

900
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,718
Oh, don`t mind this guy. He`s a...

901
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,070
I just tried to train him
to be like my wingman,

902
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,315
you know, but he`s useless.

903
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,755
He`s more like a wing nut. Yeah!

904
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,031
No, you know what?
As a matter of fact,

905
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,278
this is gonna be... Gribbletastic.

906
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,314
Yeah!

907
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,239
How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!

908
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,038
And he`s off! Yes! Finally.

909
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,676
I`m a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side

910
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,393
Tart-choppin`, body-poppin`...

911
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,318
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot
and tell me which way!

912
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,553
Did you just call me an idiot?

913
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,999
Mark.

914
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,829
- Get... Wait a minute!
- Gribble!

915
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,550
Let`s hit every single pipe
on the way down!

916
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,352
- Gribble!
- l`m trying!

917
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:42,914
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this.

918
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,315
I think that...
I think that they`re amazing and...

919
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,629
I think that...

920
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,512
I think that you`re amazing.

921
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,514
Gribble!

922
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,958
- You can change colour!
- What?

923
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,559
That is also... ``bad``.

924
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,591
- Mark.
- Chute...

925
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,711
...number... three!

926
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,035
- One, two, three!
- Come on, Grib. We gotta go!

927
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,559
- They`ll figure it out!
- No, they won`t.

928
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,079
They`re dumb as a box of rocks.

929
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,955
What dummy left that there?

930
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,078
No! Mom. Mom!

931
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,478
Mom. Mom! Mom, listen.
Mom, look at me.

932
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,035
Mom, look at me. Look at me.
I`ll explain everything, but later. OK?

933
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,479
Right now we`ve
just gotta get to the ship.

934
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,669
- The ship?
- The ship.

935
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,438
- What ship?!
- That ship!
