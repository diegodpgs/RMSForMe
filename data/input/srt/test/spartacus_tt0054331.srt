00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:55,039
NARRATOR: In the last century,
before the birth of the new
faith called Christianity,

2
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:58,140
which was destined to overthrow
the pagan tyranny of Rome

3
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:00,515
and bring about a new society,

4
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:04,715
the Roman Republic stood
at the very center of the civilized world.

5
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:08,288
"Of all things fairest,"
sang the poet,

6
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:12,819
"first among cities and home
of the gods is golden Rome".

7
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:15,593
Yet, even at the zenith
of her pride and power

8
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,727
the Republic lay fatally
stricken with a disease

9
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:20,771
called human slavery.

10
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:23,931
The age of the dictator
was at hand

11
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:27,466
waiting in the shadows
for the event to bring it forth.

12
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,245
In that same century,

13
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:33,044
in the conquered
Greek province of Thrace,

14
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:36,518
an illiterate slave woman
added to her master's wealth

15
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:40,887
by giving birth to a son
whom she named Spartacus.

16
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:43,357
A proud, rebellious son

17
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:46,588
who was sold to living death
in the mines of Libya

18
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,994
before
his thirteenth birthday.

19
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:53,226
There, under whip
and chain and sun,

20
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:56,294
he lived out his youth
and his young manhood,

21
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:58,602
dreaming the death of slavery

22
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:02,042
2,иии years before
it finally would die.

23
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,408
SOLDIER: Back to work!

24
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,810
Back to work!

25
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,191
Get up, Spartacus,
you Thracian dog!

26
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,096
Come on, get up!
Get up! Get...

27
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,325
Oh, my ankle!
My ankle!

28
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,498
My ankle!

29
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:11,740
Guard! Guard!

30
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:18,575
Spartacus again, huh?
Well, this time he dies.

31
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,810
Move along!
Back to work, all of you!

32
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:43,064
Welcome,
Lentulus Batiatus.

33
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,972
Welcome, indeed,
my dear Captain.

34
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:53,680
Oh, 11 miles through this
disastrous heat

35
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:56,617
and the cost of hiring an escort,
ruinous.

36
00:10:57,854 --> 00:11:00,516
Even so, I warrant you have
nothing fit to sell me,

37
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,921
have you, Captain?

38
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:04,426
I've wasted both
my time and my money.

39
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:05,688
Tell me the truth.

40
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:08,229
We have a few
you might be interested in.

41
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:10,959
These? Carrion.

42
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:13,024
The buzzards are late.

43
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,627
This one's not bad.
He's a Gaul.

44
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:18,230
I don't like Gauls.
Hairy.

45
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:22,136
Can he come down
unassisted?

46
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,678
Come down,
you.

47
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:25,978
Come down!

48
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:33,277
Be good enough
to show me the teeth.

49
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:34,753
Open your mouth.

50
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,187
Thank you.

51
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:41,591
Yes, as the teeth go,
so go the bones.

52
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:45,656
This mouth
is really impermissible.

53
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,098
The fellow's
made of chalk.

54
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,294
We have
many others.

55
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:58,437
The sun's over there.
I have to pay these people.

56
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:01,742
Who's that?

57
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:03,612
This one's a
Thracian.

58
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:05,082
I'm making an example
of him.

59
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:06,243
How?

60
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:07,684
Starve him to death.

61
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:10,620
It's the only thing
that impresses slaves.

62
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,316
What a pity.

63
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,725
He reacts.
Good muscle tone.

64
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:21,061
Can I see
his teeth?

65
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,260
Open your mouth,
Spartacus.

66
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:26,935
You smell
like a rhinoceros.

67
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,774
Captain, the teeth.
You asked him to open his mouth.

68
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:33,401
He doesn't
obey you?

69
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,446
His teeth are
the best thing about him.

70
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,914
He hamstrung a guard with them
not more than an hour ago.

71
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:41,885
Marvelous. I wish I'd been here.
I'll take him.

72
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:43,921
Let's look
at some of the others.

73
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,293
Come along.

74
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,184
In spite of
sickness and death,

75
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:58,384
we will profit
11,000 sesterces.

76
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:01,391
Including your commission,
of course.

77
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:04,488
Oh, no, sir.
Without my commission.

78
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:09,734
Marcellus,
there they are.

79
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:12,272
They're a dirty-looking lot,
but it's the best I could find.

80
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,273
No one else could have made
so fine a choice.

81
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:19,467
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

82
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:21,939
Slaves,

83
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:26,144
you have arrived at the gladiatorial school
of Lentulus Batiatus.

84
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:28,210
You'll be trained
by experts

85
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:30,085
to fight in pairs
to the death.

86
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:33,353
You won't fight
to the death here.

87
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:35,393
That will be
after you've been sold

88
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,428
and then for ladies
and gentlemen of quality,

89
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:40,124
for those who appreciate
a fine kill.

90
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:44,765
A gladiator's like a stallion,
he must be pampered.

91
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:47,130
You'll be oiled, bathed,

92
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:51,335
shaved, massaged,
taught to use your heads.

93
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:56,441
A good body with a dull brain
is as cheap as life itself.

94
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:58,607
You'll be given
your ceremonial caudas.

95
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,776
Marcellus, please.
There.

96
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:03,714
Be proud of them.

97
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:07,747
On special occasions,
those who please me

98
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:11,352
will even be given the companionship
of a young lady.

99
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,231
Approximately
half our graduates

100
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:18,734
live for five, 10,
10 years.

101
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:23,197
Some even attain freedom
and become trainers themselves.

102
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:24,831
Marcellus.

103
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,108
I congratulate you.

104
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,146
And may fortune smile
on most of you.

105

(BLOWING WHISTLE)

106
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:38,284
Marcellus, watch the second
from the right.

107
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:41,448
He's a Thracian.
They were going to kill him
for hamstringing a guard.

108
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,581
We'll break him of that.

109
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:45,126
Don't overdo it.
He has quality.

110
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,026
MAN: Next.

Next.

113
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,248
I like you.

114
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,979
I want you
to be my friend.

115
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,414
I want to be
your friend.

116
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:21,251
All I ask is that
you get along with me.

117
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,798
What's your name,
slave?

118
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,131
Spartacus.

119
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,994
I feel
you don't like me.

120
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:40,207
Give him your sword.

121
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:45,044
Take it!

122
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:55,218
I have a feeling
you want to kill me.

123
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:59,557
This is the only chance
you'll ever get.

124
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:01,226
Kill me.

125
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,600
Don't be afraid,
slave.

126
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:07,100
You have
that sword.

127
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:09,937
I only have
this piece of wood.

128
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:14,971
Are you
going to disobey me?

129
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:21,241
Take his sword.

130
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:25,380
You're not as stupid
as I thought.

131
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:27,685
You might even
be intelligent.

132
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:29,985
That's dangerous for slaves.

133
00:17:31,094 --> 00:17:32,562
You just remember,

134
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:35,829
from now on everything
you do I'll be watching.

135
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,764
You did
the right thing.

136
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:14,427
Every once in a while
Marcellus likes to kill a man as an example.

137
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,364
I think he's picked you.
Better watch him.

138
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,809
How long
have you been here?

139
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:25,174
Six months.

140
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:27,077
I wish
he'd pick me.

141
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,447
I want one chance at that pig before
they carry me out!

142

MARCELLUS: Quiet!
No talking down there.

143

Dionysius, you'll get us
in trouble just like in the mines.

00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:45,390
What's your name?

145

You don't want to know
my name.

146
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:51,266
I don't want to know
your name.

147
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:54,262
Just
a friendly question.

148
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,637
Gladiators
don't make friends.

149
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:59,744
If we're ever matched
in the arena together,

150
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:01,678
I'll have to
kill you.

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,181
Spartacus.

164
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:21,517
Felicia...

165
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:33,256
I've never
had a woman.

166
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:57,110
(MAN LAUGHING)

167
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:02,018
You have one now, Spartacus.
You must take her.

168
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:04,315
Go away.
What will she think of you?

169
00:22:04,387 --> 00:22:05,980
Indeed,
what will I think of you?

170
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:07,580
Go away.

171
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:10,416
Come, come.
Be generous.

172
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:12,222
We must learn
to share our pleasures.

173
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:17,130
I'm not an animal!

174
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:20,499
You're not trying to escape,
by any chance?

175
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:23,471
Direct your courage
to the girl, Spartacus.

176
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:27,973
I'm not an animal!

177
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:35,811
I'm not an animal.

178
00:22:35,884 --> 00:22:37,374
Neither am I.

179
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:16,115
What's your name?

180
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,020
Varinia.

181
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:25,194
You'll have to take her
out of here, Marcellus.

182
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:26,891
You may not be an animal,
Spartacus,

183
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:31,301
but this sorry show gives me little hope
that you'll ever be a man.

184
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,598
First rule, you get
an instant kill on the red.

185
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:24,308
Here, here.

186
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:28,211
Always remember,
go for the red first.

187
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:29,908
If you don't,
your opponent will.

188
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:33,350
In the blue,
you get a cripple.

189
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,878
Here, here,

190
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,890
here and here.

191
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:41,058
Second rule,

192
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:44,058
go for the cripple
before the slow kill.

193
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:46,964
Here's a slow kill
on the yellow.

194
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:51,133
Here, here
and here.

195
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,336
Remember,

196
00:25:53,772 --> 00:25:55,638
a slow kill may have
enough left in him

197
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,403
to kill you
before he dies.

198
00:25:58,042 --> 00:25:59,476
With a cripple,
you know you've got him

199
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:01,535
if you keep your distance
and wear him down.

200
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:04,514
The rest is all right
for a public spectacle in Rome,

201
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:05,777
but here at Capua

202
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,716
we expect more
than simple butchery

203
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:09,276
and we get it.

204
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:14,691
Spartacus, why are you
looking at that girl?

205
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:19,085
Varinia! Stand still.

206
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:23,626
(CHUCKLES)

207
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,735
Since all you can do
is look at girls,

208
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:30,738
all right, slave,
go ahead and look.

209
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:33,902
I said, look.

210
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:18,917
No. No, this one goes
to the Spaniard.

211
00:27:26,193 --> 00:27:28,719
Have a good night's rest,
Spartacus.

212
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,459
(DOOR BOLTING)

213
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:36,632
MARCELLUS: In there.

214
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,566
(MARCELLUS LAUGHING)

215
00:27:39,973 --> 00:27:40,963
(DOOR LOCKING)

216
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,272
Woman!

217
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:26,380
I've warned you
about this kind of thing.

218
00:28:30,788 --> 00:28:32,779
All right,
bring them in.

219
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:55,576
No talking!
Move along.

220
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,200
Did they hurt you?

221
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,103
No.

222
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:53,217
MARCELLUS: That's a kill.

223
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,554
One, two,

224
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:59,027
three, four, five.

225
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:01,326
One, two,

226
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:03,389
three, four...

227
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:01,679
We have visitors,
tremendous visitors.

228
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,884
Two simply enormous
Roman lords on the hill.

229
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,927
How easily impressed
you are, Ramon.

230
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:09,224
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I suppose they're enormous.

231
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:11,286
Tell them to wait
for me when they arrive.

232
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,729
Master,
you don't understand...

233
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,165
How enormous
do these Roman lords get?

234
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:18,102
One of them
is Marcus Licinius Crassus.

235
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:19,832
What?
Wait a minute.

236
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:23,433
Crassus here?
My red toga with the acorns.

237
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,944
Chairs in the atrium.
Second-best wine.

238
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:29,311
No, the best,
but small goblets.

239
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:32,248
Gracchus. You know
how Crassus loathes him.

240
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,677
Take him away.

241
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,380
I can't lift it.

242
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,015
Use your imagination.
Cover him.

243
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,616
Tell Marcellus
to get the men ready.

244
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,162
Crassus has expensive taste.
He'll want a show.

245
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,754
Forgive me, Gracchus.

246
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,513
Marcus
Licinius Crassus.

247
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,353
Most noble
radiance,

248
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:17,917
first general
of the Republic,

249
00:33:17,994 --> 00:33:21,828
father and defender
of Rome, honor my house.

250
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:23,923
Bless it
with your presence.

251
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,403
Wine, sweetmeats!

252
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:37,673
Can't you see that
Their Honors are exhausted?

253
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,141
Have the goodness
to sit.

254
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:50,924
Is anything wrong,
Your Nobility?

255
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:52,818
No.

256
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:57,428
Welcome to the
Lady Claudia Maria,

257
00:33:57,498 --> 00:34:00,798
former wife of
Lucius Caius Marius

258
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:04,327
whose recent execution
touched us all deeply.

259
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:06,504
Honor
to the Lady Helena,

260
00:34:06,574 --> 00:34:09,805
daughter of the late
Septimus Optimus Glabrus,

261
00:34:09,877 --> 00:34:13,370
whose fame shall live on
forever in the person of his son,

262
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:14,972
your brother,

263
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:18,314
Marcus
Publius Glabrus,

264
00:34:18,718 --> 00:34:20,778
hero
of the Eastern War.

265
00:34:20,854 --> 00:34:22,583
How very much
he knows.

266
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,020
Allow me to bring you
up-to-date.

267
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:29,529
We're here to celebrate the marriage
of my brother to the Lady Claudia.

268
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:32,361
A mating of eagles,
Your Sanctity.

269
00:34:32,432 --> 00:34:34,093
Fan His Magnitude.
He sweats.

270
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,396
No, no.
No, no.

271
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,130
My young friends desire
a private showing of two pairs.

272
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:39,933
Two pairs?

273
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:43,498
Oh, yes. I have something
that would please them.

274
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:45,237
Two pairs
to the death.

275
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:47,837
To the death,
Your Ladyship?

276
00:34:47,913 --> 00:34:50,405
Surely you don't think
we came all the way to Capua

277
00:34:50,483 --> 00:34:53,350
for gymnastics?

278
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:55,546
But I beg,
Your Honors,

279
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:59,284
we train the finest
gladiators in all Italy.

280
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:01,223
We can give you
a display of swordsmanship

281
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:04,125
which is better than
you can see in Rome.

282
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:05,925
When they're sold,
their new masters

283
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:07,362
may do with them
as they wish.

284
00:35:07,432 --> 00:35:11,300
But here, no,
we never fight them to the death.

285
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:12,837
Crassus.

286
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,669
Today is
an exception.

287
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,332
But the ill feeling,

288
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,603
it would spread
through the whole school.

289
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:22,873
Then the cost.
Oh, the cost.

290
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:24,573
Name your price.

291
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,415
25,000 sesterces.

292
00:35:30,387 --> 00:35:31,752
Arrange it.

293
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:34,921
Are you serious,
sir?

294
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,993
Arrange it
immediately.

295
00:35:39,729 --> 00:35:42,459
Of course, we shall want
to choose them ourselves.

296
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:45,899
You do have
a certain variety?

297
00:35:45,968 --> 00:35:47,265
Inexhaustible.

298
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,410
Spartacus, there's going to be
a fight to the death.

299
00:35:58,748 --> 00:36:00,340
To the death?
How do you know?

300
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:02,782
I heard Marcellus
tell one of his guards.

301
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:04,876
Who fights?
I don't know.

302
00:36:07,856 --> 00:36:09,324
To the death.

303
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:14,860
What if they matched
you and me?

304
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:17,925
They won't.

305
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:19,625
What if they did?

306
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,960
Would you fight?

307
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,598
I'd have to.
So would you.

308
00:36:27,675 --> 00:36:29,666
Would you try
to kill me?

309
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:33,069
Yes, I'd kill.

310
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:35,881
I'd try to stay...

311
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,942
I'd try to stay alive,
and so would you.

312
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:42,079
MARCELLUS: All gladiators
up to the training area.

313
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:44,555
Some visitors
want to admire you.

314
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:51,497
Form a line in front of me.

315
00:36:51,564 --> 00:36:53,225
Would Your Excellencies

316
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:55,563
care to make
your selection now?

317
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,799
Claudia.

318
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:10,506
Oh, they're
magnificent.

319
00:37:10,582 --> 00:37:12,846
For you,
Lady Helena,

320
00:37:12,918 --> 00:37:15,444
may I suggest
Praxus?

321
00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:19,117
A veritable tiger.

322
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:21,852
I don't like him.

323
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:29,732
I prefer that one.

324
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,700
Which one?

379
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:34,671

Did Gracchus have something to do
with this brilliant affair?

Yes, he proposed it.
Rather decently, too.

It was to control
the streets of Rome!

I only take six cohorts.
The rest of the garrison remain.

I'll refuse,
withdraw from the expedition.

One of the disadvantages
of being a patrician

you're obliged to act like one.

and go you must.

to move against you...

He won't!
Has no need to.

immobilized me altogether.

I'd order my legions to enter Rome?

01:04:58,435 --> 01:05:01,131
You can, if you have to.

596

of Rome's most ancient law,

597
01:05:03,573 --> 01:05:06,940
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions?

598

of his name!

my fathers bequeathed me.

I shall restore all the traditions
that made her great.

604
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:29,460
It follows that
I cannot come to power or defend myself

605
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:33,092
by an act which betrays
the most sacred tradition of all.

within these walls.

641
01:10:31,384 --> 01:10:33,318
What are we,
Crixus?

642
01:10:33,386 --> 01:10:35,980
What are we becoming?
Romans?

643
01:10:36,055 --> 01:10:39,048
Have we learned nothing?
What's happening to us?

644
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:41,560
We look for wine when
we should be hunting bread.

645
01:10:41,628 --> 01:10:44,392
When you've got wine,
you don't need bread!

646
01:10:44,597 --> 01:10:45,826
(ALL LAUGHING)

647
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:48,959
We can't just be a gang
of drunken raiders.

648
01:10:49,035 --> 01:10:50,366
What else
can we be?

649
01:10:50,436 --> 01:10:51,459
Gladiators.

650
01:10:52,638 --> 01:10:54,504
An army of gladiators.

651
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:57,335
There's never been
an army like that.

652
01:10:57,409 --> 01:11:00,242
One gladiator's worth
any two Roman soldiers.

653
01:11:00,312 --> 01:11:03,145
We beat the Roman guards here,
but a Roman army's different.

654
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:05,377
They fight different.

655
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:08,477
We can beat anything
they send against us if we want to.

656
01:11:08,554 --> 01:11:10,488
MAN: It takes a big army.

657
01:11:10,556 --> 01:11:12,022
We'll have
a big army.

658
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:16,185
Once we're on the march, we'll free every slave
in every town and village.

659
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,229
Can anybody
get a bigger army?

660
01:11:18,296 --> 01:11:20,526
Once we cross the Alps,
we're safe.

661
01:11:20,598 --> 01:11:23,829
Nobody can cross the Alps.
Every pass is defended by its own legion.

662
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:27,030
There's only one way
to get out of this country.

663
01:11:27,838 --> 01:11:29,136
The sea.

664
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:31,937
What good is the sea
if you have no ships?

665
01:11:32,009 --> 01:11:34,341
The Cilician pirates
have ships.

666
01:11:34,577 --> 01:11:36,569
They're at war
with Rome.

667
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,539
Every Roman galley that sails out
of Brundusium pays tribute.

668
01:11:40,617 --> 01:11:43,848
They've got the biggest fleet in the world.
I was a galley slave with them.

669
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,786
Give them enough gold,
they'll take you anywhere.

670
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:47,084
MAN: We haven't got
enough gold.

671
01:11:47,157 --> 01:11:49,853
Take every Roman we capture
and warm his back a little.

672
01:11:49,926 --> 01:11:51,553
We'll have gold all right.

and march straight to Brundusium!

Back to Vesuvius!

682
01:13:56,413 --> 01:13:57,675
Varinia.

683
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:05,545
I thought
I'd never see you again.

684
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:21,960
Everything's so different.

685
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:30,508
The last time I saw you,
you...

686
01:14:31,546 --> 01:14:35,415
You were waiting
in the arena to...

687
01:14:41,589 --> 01:14:44,956
I... I thought
you were in Rome.

688
01:14:50,164 --> 01:14:51,791
How'd you escape?

689
01:14:52,366 --> 01:14:53,424
I...

690
01:14:54,368 --> 01:14:58,464
I jumped out of the cart
and Batiatus was so fat...

691
01:15:09,482 --> 01:15:11,883
I flew out of the cart

692
01:15:13,453 --> 01:15:15,819
and Batiatus
was so fat

693
01:15:16,422 --> 01:15:18,982
that he couldn't
catch me.

694
01:15:19,058 --> 01:15:21,253
He couldn't
catch up with me.

695
01:15:21,994 --> 01:15:23,962
Do you realize

696
01:15:24,029 --> 01:15:27,294
nobody can ever
sell you again?

697
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:29,266
Nobody can sell you.

698
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:30,427
Or give you away.

699
01:15:30,502 --> 01:15:31,902
Or give you away.

700
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:34,235
Nobody can ever
make you stay with anyone.

701
01:15:34,306 --> 01:15:36,798
Nobody can make you
stay with anybody.

702
01:15:39,044 --> 01:15:41,774
Oh, I love you,
Spartacus.

703
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,186
I love you.
I love you. I love you.

704
01:15:51,622 --> 01:15:53,613
I still can't believe it.

705
01:15:56,394 --> 01:16:00,296
Forbid me
ever to leave you.

706
01:16:06,336 --> 01:16:07,929
I do forbid you.

707
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,908
I forbid you.

708
01:16:13,743 --> 01:16:15,211
I forbid you.

709
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:18,270
I forbid you.

710
01:16:42,304 --> 01:16:44,897
It was funny
at the time.

711
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,966
How good you are to me,
if I may say so.

712
01:16:48,042 --> 01:16:49,806
You may.
Thank you.

713
01:16:50,612 --> 01:16:52,546
Don't just eye those birds.
Eat them.

714
01:16:52,614 --> 01:16:55,378
There's no need to be on your
best behavior here.

715
01:16:55,450 --> 01:17:00,445
May I remind you you've been good
to me in the past.

716
01:17:00,521 --> 01:17:01,989
I've been good to you?
Oh, ho, ho.

717
01:17:02,056 --> 01:17:03,217
Oh, yes.

718
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:07,750
You've sold me slaves
at an extremely reasonable price.

719
01:17:08,695 --> 01:17:12,598
And you arranged gladiatorial
jousts at cost, practically.

720
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:15,764
You are both
ethical in business

721
01:17:15,836 --> 01:17:19,033
and certainly
farsighted socially.

722
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:21,640
Zenobia's put on weight
since I last saw her.

723
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:22,971
Hasn't she?
I like it.

724
01:17:23,043 --> 01:17:24,169
So do I.

725
01:17:25,912 --> 01:17:28,437
You and I have a tendency
towards corpulence.

726
01:17:28,514 --> 01:17:32,144
Corpulence makes a man reasonable,
pleasant and phlegmatic.

727
01:17:32,218 --> 01:17:36,120
Have you noticed the nastiest of tyrants
are invariably thin?

728
01:17:38,357 --> 01:17:42,590
In spite of your vices,
you are the most generous Roman of our time.

729
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:43,959
Vices?

730
01:17:46,431 --> 01:17:47,626
Ladies.

731
01:17:50,802 --> 01:17:53,396
Ladies?
Since when are they a vice?

732
01:17:53,905 --> 01:17:57,432
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

733
01:17:57,509 --> 01:17:59,909
I hope I pronounced
that word...

734
01:17:59,978 --> 01:18:02,811
It's well-known that even your groom
and butler are women.

735
01:18:02,881 --> 01:18:05,316
I'm the most virtuous man
in Rome.

736
01:18:05,617 --> 01:18:09,143
I keep these women out of my respect
for Roman morality.

737
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,618
That morality which
has made Rome strong enough

738
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:14,419
to steal two-thirds of the world
from its rightful owners,

739
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:18,087
founded on the sanctity
of Roman marriage and family.

740
01:18:18,162 --> 01:18:21,564
I happen to like women.
I have a promiscuous nature

741
01:18:21,632 --> 01:18:24,692
and unlike these aristocrats,
I will not take a marriage vow

742
01:18:24,768 --> 01:18:27,361
which my nature
will prevent me from keeping.

743
01:18:27,437 --> 01:18:30,702
You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

744
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:32,002
Exactly.

745
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:36,805
It must be tantalizing to be surrounded
by so much purity.

746
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,113
It is.

747
01:18:42,652 --> 01:18:46,179
Let's mix business with pleasure.
How may I help you?

748
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:52,182
Great Gracchus,
I find it difficult to hate,

749
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,593
but there's one man
I can't think of without fuming.

750
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,131
Who's that?
Crassus.

751
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:58,928
You've grown
very ambitious in your hatred.

752
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:02,437
Do you blame me? There I was,
better than a millionaire in the morning

753
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:06,873
and a penniless refugee by nightfall
with nothing but rags and my flesh.

754
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:10,274
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua

755
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:13,507
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs.

756
01:19:14,014 --> 01:19:16,540
These two daughters of Venus

757
01:19:16,617 --> 01:19:19,348
had to taunt the gladiators,
force them to fight to the death,

758
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:22,446
and before I knew what had happened,
revolution on my hands.

759
01:19:22,523 --> 01:19:26,357
What revenge have you in mind?

760
01:19:28,162 --> 01:19:30,459
I sold Crassus
this woman Varinia.

761
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:31,622
Whom?

762
01:19:32,065 --> 01:19:34,761
Varinia. May the gods
give her wings.

763
01:19:34,834 --> 01:19:36,234
There was no contract,

764
01:19:36,302 --> 01:19:39,761
but she was clearly his slave
as soon as the deal was made.

765
01:19:39,839 --> 01:19:42,399
Now she's off with Spartacus
killing people in their beds.

766
01:19:42,475 --> 01:19:45,638
And Crassus,
no mention of money.

767
01:19:46,713 --> 01:19:49,512
You never offered me
this woman. Why not?

768
01:19:50,182 --> 01:19:52,810
Well, she's not
remotely your type, Gracchus.

769
01:19:52,885 --> 01:19:54,443
She is very thin and...

770
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,817
Look around you.

771
01:19:56,288 --> 01:19:59,121
You'll see women
of all sizes.

772
01:19:59,191 --> 01:20:00,681
Well, yes.

773
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:03,626
500 sesterces deposit
on Varinia.

774
01:20:03,695 --> 01:20:07,894
Since he hasn't paid, this gives me first
call over Crassus when she's caught.

775
01:20:08,467 --> 01:20:10,366
May the gods adore you.

776
01:20:11,302 --> 01:20:13,532
Why do you buy a woman
you've never seen?

777
01:20:13,604 --> 01:20:16,437
To annoy Crassus, of course,
and help you.

778
01:20:23,481 --> 01:20:25,506
Fetch a stool,
Antoninus.

779
01:20:31,855 --> 01:20:33,448
In here with it.

780
01:20:40,263 --> 01:20:41,731
That will do.

781
01:20:48,939 --> 01:20:50,907
Do you steal,
Antoninus?

782
01:20:51,174 --> 01:20:52,539
No, master.

783
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:54,908
Do you lie?

784
01:20:56,045 --> 01:20:57,911
Not if
I can avoid it.

785
01:20:59,448 --> 01:21:02,816
Have you ever
dishonored the gods?

786
01:21:02,918 --> 01:21:04,284
No, master.

787
01:21:05,621 --> 01:21:09,854
Do you refrain from these vices
out of respect for the moral virtues?

788
01:21:10,526 --> 01:21:11,925
Yes, master.

789
01:21:16,064 --> 01:21:17,793
Do you eat
oysters?

790
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:20,657
When I have them,
master.

791
01:21:21,469 --> 01:21:23,130
Do you eat
snails?

792
01:21:24,172 --> 01:21:25,537
No, master.

793
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:29,943
Do you consider
the eating of oysters to be moral

794
01:21:30,011 --> 01:21:32,708
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

795
01:21:34,414 --> 01:21:35,780
No, master.

796
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:38,174
Of course not.

797
01:21:41,421 --> 01:21:44,050
It is all a matter
of taste, isn't it?

798
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:45,924
Yes, master.

799
01:21:47,227 --> 01:21:49,821
And taste is not
the same as appetite

800
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:53,423
and therefore not a question
of morals, is it?

801
01:21:55,768 --> 01:21:56,826
Hmm?

802
01:21:59,405 --> 01:22:01,635
It could be
argued so, master.

803
01:22:05,044 --> 01:22:07,809
That will do.
My robe, Antoninus.

804
01:22:24,462 --> 01:22:26,363
My taste
includes

805
01:22:27,566 --> 01:22:30,035
both snails
and oysters.

806
01:22:39,343 --> 01:22:40,936
Antoninus, look.

807
01:22:42,313 --> 01:22:43,940
Across the river.

808
01:22:45,282 --> 01:22:47,615
There is something
you must see.

809
01:22:51,956 --> 01:22:54,720
There, boy,
is Rome.

810
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:58,287
The might,
the majesty,

811
01:22:59,696 --> 01:23:01,425
the terror of Rome.

812
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:07,901
There is the power that bestrides the known
world like a colossus.

813
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:11,664
No man
can withstand Rome.

814
01:23:12,909 --> 01:23:15,036
No nation
can withstand her.

815
01:23:16,812 --> 01:23:18,279
How much less

816
01:23:19,715 --> 01:23:20,875
a boy?

817
01:23:23,318 --> 01:23:24,376
Hmm?

(CHUCKLING)

819
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:31,287
There's only one way
to deal with Rome, Antoninus.

820
01:23:32,027 --> 01:23:33,756
You must serve her.

821
01:23:35,497 --> 01:23:37,988
You must abase yourself
before her.

822
01:23:40,401 --> 01:23:42,529
You must grovel at her feet.

823
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:48,341
You must love her.

824
01:23:53,214 --> 01:23:55,205
Isn't that so, Antoninus?

825
01:23:59,085 --> 01:24:00,417
Antoninus!

826
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:05,021
Antoninus?

827
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:39,876
Take your time!

828
01:25:39,949 --> 01:25:41,382
How are they coming?
Good.

829
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:44,351
Give me another thousand like them
and we can march on Rome.

Here, on Vesuvius, we're safe from attack
while we organize ourselves into an army.

833
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:09,273
It may take six months,
a year.

834

Once we're strong, we're gonna fight
our way south to the sea.

835

We're going to arrange
for ships with the Cilician pirates.

836
01:26:16,383 --> 01:26:18,613
The sea will be
our road home.

If you agree,
you may join us.

838

If you don't agree,

with women?

Where would you be now,

if some woman hadn't fought
all the pains of hell

843
01:26:36,335 --> 01:26:38,327
to get you into
this accursed world?

844
01:26:38,404 --> 01:26:41,431
I can handle a knife in the dark
as well as anyone.

845
01:26:41,507 --> 01:26:43,703
I can cast spells
and brew poisons.

846
01:26:43,776 --> 01:26:46,870
I have made the death shrouds
for seven Roman masters.

Where do you
come from?

Most of us come
from the estate of Lillius.

did you do there?

Sixteen years a carpenter,
a mason.

Good.
We can use carpenters.

did you do?

Singer of songs?

But what work
did you do?

864
01:27:30,019 --> 01:27:32,249
That's my work.
I also juggle.

865
01:27:33,022 --> 01:27:35,150
Juggle.
What else do you do?

866
01:27:35,692 --> 01:27:37,660
I can do
feats of magic.

867

01:36:24,094 --> 01:36:27,359
Well, where is this
slave general?

960
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:33,494
Dionysius, get the litter bearers
out of the rain.

961
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:36,300
Give them food,
a bed and their freedom.

962
01:36:38,208 --> 01:36:39,436
DIONYSIUS:
All right, follow me.

963
01:36:39,509 --> 01:36:41,273
We'll pay you
for them.

964
01:36:41,411 --> 01:36:43,743
We have no slaves
in this camp.

965
01:36:49,385 --> 01:36:51,819
Tigranes Levantus
at your service.

966
01:36:52,488 --> 01:36:54,046

"To the General of the Italian slaves
called Spartacus

970
01:37:06,434 --> 01:37:09,460

Cilician Governor of Delos".

"The Governor of Delos".

979
01:37:27,988 --> 01:37:29,922
Who are
Isis and Serapis?

980
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:31,287
Gods of the East.

981
01:37:31,591 --> 01:37:33,890
Why should they
want us to win?

982
01:37:34,094 --> 01:37:37,758
Because
they favor Cilicia,

983
01:37:37,831 --> 01:37:40,994
and Cilicia, like you,
fights against the Romans.

984
01:37:45,305 --> 01:37:47,295
Would you like
some wine?

985
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,743
I drink only after the bargain
has been concluded, never before.

986
01:38:00,386 --> 01:38:03,082
How many ships
do these Cilicians have?

987
01:38:03,155 --> 01:38:04,646
Five hundred, at least.

988
01:38:05,357 --> 01:38:07,485
But no deal is too small,
I assure you.

989
01:38:07,559 --> 01:38:09,322
SPARTACUS:
We'll need them all.

990
01:38:09,894 --> 01:38:10,987
All?

991
01:38:11,062 --> 01:38:12,530
What is the price?

992
01:38:13,865 --> 01:38:18,097
Price is
100,000 sesterces per ship.

993
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:22,372
For 500 ships,
that would be

994
01:38:23,408 --> 01:38:25,706
50 million sesterces.

995
01:38:27,212 --> 01:38:29,805
You have such a sum?

996
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:30,972
We will have.

997
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:36,746
See for yourself.

998
01:38:40,357 --> 01:38:41,722
Beautiful.

999
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:43,089
When will the ships
be ready?

1000
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,559
Beautiful.

1001
01:38:44,995 --> 01:38:47,225
I love to see
such beauty.

1002
01:38:47,297 --> 01:38:49,492
When will the ships
be ready?

1003
01:38:50,233 --> 01:38:53,498
Ah, my friend,
when will you be ready?

1004
01:38:55,204 --> 01:38:57,173
How long
will it take you

1005
01:38:59,008 --> 01:39:03,741
to cross one-third the length of Italy
fighting a major battle in every town?

1006
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:05,576
One year?
Two years?

1007
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:10,816
If we're not in Brundusium seven months
from now, we'll never be there.

1008
01:39:13,088 --> 01:39:15,318
LEVANTUS: What if we
assemble the ships,

1009
01:39:16,758 --> 01:39:19,955
and there is no longer
a slave army to board them?

1010
01:39:21,029 --> 01:39:25,091
We'll give you a chest of treasure now,
the rest when we get to Brundusium.

1011
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:26,896
This one?
Yes.

1012
01:39:28,803 --> 01:39:29,896
Done!

1013
01:39:30,272 --> 01:39:33,468
Seven months from now
the ships will be assembled.

1014
01:39:34,508 --> 01:39:36,909
Arrange to have
the chest loaded.

1015
01:39:37,478 --> 01:39:38,843
And now,
with your permission,

1016
01:39:38,913 --> 01:39:41,382
I should like to have
the wine you offered me.

1017
01:39:41,448 --> 01:39:42,507
Will you join me?

1018
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:43,743
I will.

1019
01:39:44,051 --> 01:39:45,678
Excellent workmanship.

1020
01:39:45,753 --> 01:39:47,983
It came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman.

1021
01:39:48,055 --> 01:39:51,149
I've heard that you are
of noble birth yourself.

1022
01:39:51,457 --> 01:39:53,426
I'm the son
and grandson of slaves.

1023
01:39:53,526 --> 01:39:56,359
I knew that,
when I saw you couldn't read.

1024
01:39:57,530 --> 01:40:01,262
Of course, it pleases Roman vanity
to think that you are noble.

1025
01:40:01,334 --> 01:40:04,065
They shrink from the idea
of fighting mere slaves,

1026
01:40:04,137 --> 01:40:06,367
especially a man
like Crassus.

1027
01:40:08,341 --> 01:40:10,605
You know him?

1028
01:40:10,677 --> 01:40:12,735
I entertained him
one afternoon.

1029
01:40:13,178 --> 01:40:14,202
You?

1030
01:40:14,279 --> 01:40:15,440
In the arena.

1031
01:40:18,016 --> 01:40:19,541
Excellent wine.

1032
01:40:21,486 --> 01:40:22,852
May I...

1033
01:40:23,355 --> 01:40:25,187
May I ask you something?

1034
01:40:25,257 --> 01:40:26,747
You can ask.

1035
01:40:26,825 --> 01:40:29,920
Surely you know you're going to lose,
don't you?

1036
01:40:31,863 --> 01:40:33,194
You have no chance.

1037
01:40:33,264 --> 01:40:36,324
At this very moment,
six cohorts of the garrison of Rome

1038
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,630
are approaching
this position.

1039
01:40:41,138 --> 01:40:43,130
What are you going to do?

1040
01:40:48,212 --> 01:40:50,806
We'll decide that
when they get here.

1041
01:40:55,118 --> 01:40:57,143
Let me put it differently.

1042
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:00,051
If you looked into
a magic crystal

1043
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:04,383
and you saw your army
destroyed and yourself dead,

1044
01:41:05,128 --> 01:41:09,929
if you saw that in the future,
as I'm sure you're seeing it now,

1045
01:41:10,367 --> 01:41:12,494
would you continue to fight?

1046
01:41:13,336 --> 01:41:14,359
Yes.

1047
01:41:14,436 --> 01:41:16,530
Knowing that you must lose?

1048
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:19,367
Knowing we can't.

1049
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:23,208
All men lose
when they die.

1050
01:41:23,278 --> 01:41:27,306
And all men die, but a slave
and a free man lose different things.

1051
01:41:27,383 --> 01:41:29,180
They both lose life.

1052
01:41:29,251 --> 01:41:32,551
When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

1053
01:41:33,589 --> 01:41:35,488
A slave loses his pain.

1054
01:41:37,525 --> 01:41:40,256
Death is the only freedom
a slave knows.

1055
01:41:40,528 --> 01:41:42,929
That's why
he's not afraid of it.

1056
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:46,730
That's why we'll win.

1057
01:42:15,362 --> 01:42:17,762
ANTONINUS: Spartacus,
that pirate was right.

1058
01:42:20,032 --> 01:42:23,025
The garrison of Rome,
they're setting up camp.

1059
01:42:24,103 --> 01:42:26,799
How many are there?
About six cohorts.

1060
01:42:27,073 --> 01:42:28,199
Where?

1061
01:42:28,274 --> 01:42:30,970
At the mouth of the valley,
against the cliffs.

1062
01:42:33,846 --> 01:42:34,938
Strong camp?

1063
01:42:35,014 --> 01:42:36,913
They've built
no stockade.

1064
01:42:39,084 --> 01:42:40,517
No stockade?

1065
01:42:40,952 --> 01:42:41,942
Are you sure?

1066
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:43,579
I'm very sure.

1067
01:42:43,922 --> 01:42:46,584
This campaign
is great sport for them.

1068
01:42:46,658 --> 01:42:48,922
The Romans
are having a picnic.

1069
01:42:48,993 --> 01:42:50,052
Did they see you?

1070
01:42:50,128 --> 01:42:51,618
No. We were hidden.

1071
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:57,829
Maybe we ought to join
this Roman picnic.

1072
01:42:57,901 --> 01:42:59,392
Form your men.

1073
01:43:05,342 --> 01:43:06,742
Six cohorts.

1074
01:43:08,011 --> 01:43:12,540
A lot of arms and weapons
to build our army with.

1075
01:43:40,475 --> 01:43:43,103
Crixus always wanted
to march on Rome.

1076
01:43:44,146 --> 01:43:46,046
Now he doesn't have to.

1077
01:43:46,815 --> 01:43:48,476

02:03:58,434 --> 02:04:00,664
The best wine comes from home,
wherever it is.

1274
02:04:00,736 --> 02:04:02,032
I agree with you.

1275
02:04:24,325 --> 02:04:25,656
Gentlemen.

1276
02:04:26,727 --> 02:04:28,491
Any reports
on Metapontum?

1277
02:04:28,562 --> 02:04:30,360
Heralds are crying
the news now.

1278
02:04:30,431 --> 02:04:33,457
We lost 10,000 men,
including Commodius and his officers.

1279
02:04:33,534 --> 02:04:35,195
Nineteen thousand?

1280
02:04:37,838 --> 02:04:39,533
Have you estates
in Metapontum?

1281
02:04:39,873 --> 02:04:40,897
No.

1282
02:04:41,075 --> 02:04:42,871
A son with Commodius.

1283
02:04:44,243 --> 02:04:46,542
With your permission,
good day.

1284
02:04:49,015 --> 02:04:52,474
We take five years
to train a legion.

1285
02:04:52,552 --> 02:04:56,784
How can this Spartacus
train an army in seven months?

1286
02:04:56,856 --> 02:04:59,655
There's something wrong,
something very wrong.

1287
02:05:00,259 --> 02:05:01,818
We should have
an investigation.

1288
02:05:01,894 --> 02:05:03,384
By all means,
an investigation.

1289
02:05:03,462 --> 02:05:04,793
Where is
Spartacus now?

1290
02:05:04,863 --> 02:05:07,628
He's nearing
the seaport of Brundusium.

1291
02:05:07,699 --> 02:05:10,464
I need a few moments
of the Commander's time.

1292
02:05:10,535 --> 02:05:12,265
Will you excuse us?

1293
02:05:17,609 --> 02:05:22,012
I hear you've taken a house
in the fourth ward.

1294
02:05:22,714 --> 02:05:24,738
Not a very
splendid house.

1295
02:05:25,282 --> 02:05:28,047
And you feasted 11,000 plebeians
in the Field of Mars.

1296
02:05:28,119 --> 02:05:30,645
It scarcely could've been
called a feast.

1297
02:05:31,389 --> 02:05:33,619
For 200 years, your family and mine
have been members

1298
02:05:33,691 --> 02:05:36,854
of the Equestrian Order
and the Patrician Party,

1299
02:05:36,927 --> 02:05:38,862
servants and rulers
of Rome.

1300
02:05:39,997 --> 02:05:42,523
Why have you left us
for Gracchus and the mob?

1301
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:45,125
I've left no one,
least of all Rome.

1302
02:05:45,702 --> 02:05:49,764
But this much I've learned from Gracchus,
Rome is the mob.

1303
02:05:49,839 --> 02:05:50,863
No!

1304
02:05:51,741 --> 02:05:54,734
Rome is an eternal thought
in the mind of God.

1305
02:05:55,478 --> 02:05:58,004
I had no idea
you'd grown religious.

1306
02:05:58,448 --> 02:06:00,143
That doesn't matter.

1307
02:06:00,216 --> 02:06:02,879
If there were no gods at all,
I'd revere them.

1308
02:06:02,952 --> 02:06:06,388
If there were no Rome,
I'd dream of her

1309
02:06:06,455 --> 02:06:08,218
as I want you
to do.

1310
02:06:09,725 --> 02:06:12,524
I want you to come back
to your own kind.

1311
02:06:12,828 --> 02:06:14,296
I beg you to.

1312
02:06:15,431 --> 02:06:18,230
Is it me you want,
or is it the garrison?

1313
02:06:19,134 --> 02:06:20,227
Both.

1314
02:06:20,669 --> 02:06:22,262
Tell me frankly.

1315
02:06:22,337 --> 02:06:25,398
If you were I,
would you take the field against Spartacus?

1316
02:06:25,474 --> 02:06:27,066
Of course.
Why?

1317
02:06:27,341 --> 02:06:29,674
We have no other choice
if we're to save Rome.

1318
02:06:29,744 --> 02:06:31,473
Ah, Caesar!

1319
02:06:31,979 --> 02:06:33,345
Which Rome?

1320
02:06:33,714 --> 02:06:34,909
Theirs

1321
02:06:35,683 --> 02:06:36,946
or ours?

1322
02:06:40,722 --> 02:06:43,020
You know Gracchus
is my friend.

1323
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:46,722
I won't betray him.

1324
02:06:48,662 --> 02:06:49,856
Caesar?

1325
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,731
Which is worse?
To betray a friend or betray Rome herself?

1326
02:06:56,803 --> 02:06:59,033
My dear Crassus,
I face no such choice.

1327
02:06:59,106 --> 02:07:01,631
You will,
sooner than you think.

1328
02:07:03,543 --> 02:07:06,809
Good afternoon, Crassus.
I've been looking for you.

1329
02:07:07,047 --> 02:07:08,639
Your new master.

1330
02:07:11,517 --> 02:07:14,612
The Senate's been in session
all day over this business with Spartacus.

1331
02:07:14,687 --> 02:07:17,816
We've got eight legions
and no one to lead them.

1332
02:07:18,457 --> 02:07:20,221
The minute you offer
the general's command,

1333
02:07:20,292 --> 02:07:22,887
they start wheezing
like winded mules.

1334
02:07:22,962 --> 02:07:25,328
I've seen such epidemics before,
haven't you?

1335
02:07:25,397 --> 02:07:26,387
How's your health?

1336
02:07:26,465 --> 02:07:27,489
Excellent, as you
very well know.

1337
02:07:27,566 --> 02:07:30,194
I take it the Senate's
now offering the command to me.

1338
02:07:30,268 --> 02:07:31,531
You've been
expecting it.

1339
02:07:31,603 --> 02:07:32,831
I have.

1340
02:07:32,904 --> 02:07:35,600
Have you thought how costly
my services might be?

1341
02:07:35,673 --> 02:07:37,107
We buy everything else
these days.

1342
02:07:37,175 --> 02:07:39,268
No reason why we shouldn't be charged
for patriotism.

1343
02:07:39,344 --> 02:07:40,937
What's your fee?

1344
02:07:43,381 --> 02:07:47,648
My election as First Consul,
command of all the legions of Italy,

1345
02:07:48,253 --> 02:07:51,881
and the abolition of senatorial authority
over the courts.

1346
02:07:52,156 --> 02:07:53,623
Dictatorship.

1347
02:07:54,725 --> 02:07:55,885
Order.

1348
02:07:58,028 --> 02:07:59,621
Let me know if my terms
are acceptable.

1349
02:07:59,696 --> 02:08:02,188
I can tell you now.
They're unacceptable.

1350
02:08:02,933 --> 02:08:06,369
For the present, perhaps,
but times change and so does the Senate.

1351
02:08:06,436 --> 02:08:08,268
When that day comes,
I shall be ready.

1352
02:08:08,338 --> 02:08:09,635
Convey my respects
to your wife.

1353
02:08:09,706 --> 02:08:11,503
With pleasure.

1354
02:08:14,043 --> 02:08:15,807
He's right,
you know.

1355
02:08:15,878 --> 02:08:18,575
If something isn't done about Spartacus,
the Senate will change.

1356
02:08:18,648 --> 02:08:23,551
And Crassus will save Rome
from the slave army by assuming dictatorship.

1357
02:08:26,255 --> 02:08:29,350
But that depends on which way
Spartacus jumps.

1358
02:08:29,425 --> 02:08:31,222
Just now he's trying
to get out of Italy.

1359
02:08:31,293 --> 02:08:34,092
If he succeeds,
the crisis is over

1360
02:08:34,162 --> 02:08:37,257
and Crassus may stay
in retirement indefinitely.

1361
02:08:37,732 --> 02:08:40,861
I've arranged for Spartacus
to escape from Italy.

1362
02:08:40,936 --> 02:08:42,164
What?

1363
02:08:42,537 --> 02:08:45,404
I've made a little deal
with the Cilician pirates.

1364
02:08:45,473 --> 02:08:47,499
I've assured them
that we won't interfere

1365
02:08:47,576 --> 02:08:51,103
if they transport
Spartacus and his slaves out of Italy.

1366
02:08:52,913 --> 02:08:55,212
So now we
deal with pirates.

1367
02:08:55,850 --> 02:08:57,613
We bargain with criminals.

1368
02:08:57,685 --> 02:09:01,883
Don't be so stiff-necked.
Politics is a practical profession.

1369
02:09:01,956 --> 02:09:05,585
If a criminal has what you want,
you do business with him.

1370
02:09:42,461 --> 02:09:44,759
How far are we
from Brundusium?

1371
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:46,855
About
20 miles.

1372
02:09:48,066 --> 02:09:51,798
Our army will camp here tonight.
They're six hours behind us.

1373
02:09:51,870 --> 02:09:56,068
Patullus, ride ahead to Brundusium.
Bring Tigranes here.

1374
02:09:56,140 --> 02:09:59,076
Marco, report back
to Spartacus.

1375
02:09:59,143 --> 02:10:01,669
Tell him we camp tonight
by the sea!

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

1378
02:10:43,485 --> 02:10:45,476
If all goes well,

1379
02:10:45,554 --> 02:10:47,716
we can load
150 ships a day.

1380
02:10:47,790 --> 02:10:50,657
That's your job, Dionysius.
Work with the Cilician pirates.

1381
02:10:50,726 --> 02:10:52,387
That ought to
keep him busy.

1382
02:10:52,461 --> 02:10:54,657
Saves me finding
someplace to sleep.

1383
02:10:54,730 --> 02:10:57,198
Crixus, keep giving me
reports on Pompey.

1384
02:10:57,265 --> 02:10:58,733
There won't be
any surprises.

1385
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:02,463
I still want patrols up to the time
we call them to board ship.

1386
02:11:02,537 --> 02:11:04,471
I'll get them together.
Spartacus,

1387
02:11:04,539 --> 02:11:07,474
the harbor district in Brundusium
has food warehouses,

1388
02:11:07,542 --> 02:11:10,102
but not enough to provide
for the whole fleet.

1389
02:11:10,178 --> 02:11:11,975
The countryside's
filled with cattle.

1390
02:11:12,046 --> 02:11:13,946
We've salt
to preserve them.

1391
02:11:14,015 --> 02:11:15,380
I'll handle it.

1392
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:19,884
Find out how many men we have in camp
who were galley slaves or sailors.

1393
02:11:19,953 --> 02:11:21,819
Tigranes Levantus.

1394
02:11:21,922 --> 02:11:23,321
Ah!

1395
02:11:24,524 --> 02:11:25,617
My dear General.

1396
02:11:25,692 --> 02:11:26,921
Welcome, Tigranes.

1397
02:11:27,461 --> 02:11:31,488
No, no. You needn't look for litter bearers
to emancipate. I rode a horse.

1398
02:11:31,565 --> 02:11:34,659
Your gods, Isis and Serapis
must've been good to us.

1399
02:11:35,902 --> 02:11:39,201
The balance of the 50 million
sesterces we owe you.

1400
02:11:40,906 --> 02:11:42,397
General, I...

1401
02:11:43,109 --> 02:11:46,169
I bear a heavy burden
of evil tidings.

1402
02:11:49,348 --> 02:11:50,713
What is it?

1403
02:11:52,585 --> 02:11:55,611
Pompey and his army
has landed in Italy.

1404
02:11:56,055 --> 02:11:58,750
At the port of Rhegium
three days ago.

1405
02:11:58,823 --> 02:12:01,087
We get complete reports
on their movements.

1406
02:12:01,159 --> 02:12:02,991
But do you also know

1407
02:12:03,061 --> 02:12:05,996
that a Roman fleet
carrying Lucullus and his army

1408
02:12:06,064 --> 02:12:08,396
arrives tomorrow
at Brundusium?

1409
02:12:10,835 --> 02:12:12,030
Lucullus, here?

1410
02:12:12,103 --> 02:12:13,799
You have no ships.

1411
02:12:17,709 --> 02:12:19,733
I saw them in the harbor.

1412
02:12:21,345 --> 02:12:25,145
The Cilician fleet,
out of strategic necessity,

1413
02:12:25,215 --> 02:12:27,912
has been obliged
to withdraw.

1414
02:12:29,153 --> 02:12:30,643
Withdraw?

1415
02:12:30,888 --> 02:12:32,788
There are
no ships at all?

1416
02:12:40,830 --> 02:12:44,664
Cilician pirates can destroy
any Roman fleet that ever sailed.

1417
02:12:45,435 --> 02:12:47,995
If they run away now,
it's not because they're afraid!

1418
02:12:48,071 --> 02:12:49,402
You better give me
a better reason.

1419
02:12:49,472 --> 02:12:51,565
I'm as desolated
as you are, General.

1420
02:12:51,641 --> 02:12:53,268
Stand up. Up!

1421
02:12:54,977 --> 02:12:56,468
On your toes.

1422
02:13:00,449 --> 02:13:01,916
You'll cut the skin.

1423
02:13:01,983 --> 02:13:04,282
Why did the Cilicians
run away?

1424
02:13:04,586 --> 02:13:06,111
They were paid.

1425
02:13:07,022 --> 02:13:09,923
And who paid them?
Who?

1426
02:13:11,026 --> 02:13:12,255

1428
02:13:15,997 --> 02:13:17,226
Crassus.

1429
02:13:18,467 --> 02:13:20,764
Crassus won't
fight us himself.

1430
02:13:21,068 --> 02:13:24,038
The reports say he won't take
the command of an army.

1431
02:13:24,405 --> 02:13:27,568
Why would he bribe your pirates
to keep us from escaping?

1432
02:13:27,641 --> 02:13:28,836
I don't know.

1433
02:13:28,909 --> 02:13:33,074
How can I answer, when there is no answer?
I've been betrayed just as you have.

1434
02:13:33,147 --> 02:13:34,876
There is an answer.

1435
02:13:36,116 --> 02:13:38,745
There must be an answer
to everything.

1436
02:13:40,087 --> 02:13:42,180
Five miles
from Brundusium.

1437
02:13:44,357 --> 02:13:45,882
Here's Rhegium.

1438
02:13:47,093 --> 02:13:50,256
Pompey's march must've brought him
to about here.

1439
02:13:50,363 --> 02:13:52,957
He's four days away,
maybe more.

1440
02:13:54,667 --> 02:13:57,330
Lucullus lands
at Brundusium tomorrow.

1441
02:13:57,904 --> 02:14:00,032
If we engage Lucullus,

1442
02:14:00,106 --> 02:14:03,200
Pompey will have time
to march against our rear.

1443
02:14:04,676 --> 02:14:07,009
If we turn west
to meet Pompey,

1444
02:14:08,847 --> 02:14:11,441
Lucullus will march
against our rear.

1445
02:14:12,784 --> 02:14:17,119
The only other army
in all of Italy is here.

1446
02:14:17,489 --> 02:14:18,581
Rome.

1447
02:14:19,758 --> 02:14:21,419
Yes, of course!

1448
02:14:21,927 --> 02:14:24,793
Crassus is inviting us
to march on Rome,

1449
02:14:24,862 --> 02:14:27,161
so he can take the field
against us.

1450
02:14:27,665 --> 02:14:29,429
Crassus wants us
to march on Rome?

1451
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:30,524
He's forcing us to.

1452
02:14:30,601 --> 02:14:35,300
He knows I won't let myself be trapped between
two armies with my back to the sea.

1453
02:14:35,373 --> 02:14:38,001
He knows my only
other choice is Rome.

1454
02:14:39,544 --> 02:14:41,774
Somewhere on the way,
we meet.

1455
02:14:42,446 --> 02:14:45,438
If he beats us,
he becomes the savior of Rome,

1456
02:14:45,515 --> 02:14:47,745
and there's his final victory
over the Senate.

1457
02:14:47,817 --> 02:14:52,414
General, allow me to redeem myself
in your eyes.

1458
02:14:53,156 --> 02:14:54,419
For a small commission,

1459
02:14:54,491 --> 02:14:59,452
I can arrange for you,
your family and your leaders, of course,

1460
02:14:59,529 --> 02:15:02,760
to be smuggled out of Italy and transported
to one of the eastern countries

1461
02:15:02,832 --> 02:15:05,630
where men like you are welcome
and appreciated.

1462
02:15:05,701 --> 02:15:08,602
You can live like kings
for the rest of your lives.

1463
02:15:08,671 --> 02:15:10,764
What do you think,
General?

1464
02:15:11,106 --> 02:15:12,335
Go away.

1465
02:15:14,143 --> 02:15:15,372
Go away?

1466
02:15:18,981 --> 02:15:20,210
Go away.

1467
02:15:29,290 --> 02:15:31,816
Tell the trumpeters
to sound assembly.

1468
02:15:39,767 --> 02:15:43,761
Tonight, a Roman army lands
in the harbor of Brundusium.

1469
02:15:45,039 --> 02:15:47,974
Another army is approaching us
from the west.

1470
02:15:48,208 --> 02:15:52,441
Between them, they hope to trap us here,
against the sea.

1471
02:15:52,913 --> 02:15:56,611
The Cilician pirates have betrayed us.
We have no ships.

1472
02:15:56,750 --> 02:15:59,242
"By order of the Senate

1473
02:15:59,987 --> 02:16:03,616
"be it known that we have
this day elected

1474
02:16:03,690 --> 02:16:06,488
"Marcus Licinius Crassus

1475
02:16:07,059 --> 02:16:09,426
"First Consul of the Republic

1476
02:16:09,495 --> 02:16:13,693
"and Commander-in-Chief
of the armies of Rome".

1477
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:16,535
ALL: Hail Crassus!

1478
02:16:17,203 --> 02:16:20,935
Rome will not allow us
to escape from Italy.

1479
02:16:22,575 --> 02:16:25,840
We have no choice
but to march against Rome herself

1480
02:16:26,612 --> 02:16:29,808
and end this war the only way
it could have ended.

1481
02:16:30,482 --> 02:16:34,077
By freeing every slave
in Italy.

1482
02:16:34,452 --> 02:16:38,082
I promise you a new Rome,

1483
02:16:39,124 --> 02:16:41,593
a new Italy and a new empire.

1484
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:45,753
I promise the destruction
of the slave army

1485
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:50,790
and the restoration of order
throughout all our territories.

1486
02:16:51,368 --> 02:16:54,929
I'd rather be here,
a free man among brothers,

1487
02:16:55,506 --> 02:16:58,475
facing a long march
and a hard fight,

1488
02:16:58,575 --> 02:17:01,807
than to be the richest
citizen of Rome,

1489
02:17:02,246 --> 02:17:04,840
fat with food
he didn't work for,

1490
02:17:05,449 --> 02:17:07,383
and surrounded by slaves.

1491
02:17:07,718 --> 02:17:10,345
I promise the living body
of Spartacus

1492
02:17:11,054 --> 02:17:13,852
for whatever punishment
you may deem fit.

1493
02:17:14,557 --> 02:17:17,049
That, or his head.

1494
02:17:18,828 --> 02:17:22,196
This I vow by the spirits
of all my forefathers.

1495
02:17:23,433 --> 02:17:25,230
This I have sworn

1496
02:17:26,235 --> 02:17:28,898
in the temple that guards
their bones.

1497
02:17:30,505 --> 02:17:32,770
ALL: Hail Crassus!

1498
02:17:33,175 --> 02:17:35,473
We've traveled
a long ways together.

1499
02:17:36,244 --> 02:17:40,375
We've fought many battles
and won great victories.

1500
02:17:41,149 --> 02:17:45,052
Now instead of taking ship
for our homes across the sea,

1501
02:17:45,954 --> 02:17:48,048
we must fight again.

1502
02:17:49,191 --> 02:17:53,786
Maybe there's no peace in this world,
for us or for anyone else.

1503
02:17:53,861 --> 02:17:55,260
I don't know.

1504
02:17:56,297 --> 02:18:00,233
But I do know
that as long as we live,

1505
02:18:00,968 --> 02:18:03,403
we must stay true
to ourselves.

1506
02:18:05,539 --> 02:18:07,769
I do know that we're brothers.

1507
02:18:08,642 --> 02:18:10,735
And I know that we're free.

1508
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:19,281
We march tonight!

1509
02:19:53,309 --> 02:19:55,174
Hail Crassus!
Hail Crassus!

1510
02:19:56,177 --> 02:19:58,077
Greetings to you,
Crassus.

1511
02:19:58,146 --> 02:20:00,672
Caius. Gentlemen.

1512
02:20:02,083 --> 02:20:03,847
Have your dispositions
been made?

1513
02:20:03,918 --> 02:20:08,083
Each maniple knows its position, sir,
and exactly what's expected.

1514
02:20:08,523 --> 02:20:12,050
Every legion commander
has been given his battle orders.

1515
02:20:12,493 --> 02:20:15,223
Excellent. All positions
will now be changed.

1516
02:20:15,295 --> 02:20:16,524
Changed?

1517
02:20:17,364 --> 02:20:20,994
Spartacus takes too keen
an interest in our plans, I fear.

1518
02:20:21,835 --> 02:20:25,032
New battle orders will be issued
in a short while.

1519
02:20:27,875 --> 02:20:31,834
Spartacus has every reason
to believe that he has outdistanced

1520
02:20:31,912 --> 02:20:34,745
the pursuing armies
of Pompey and Lucullus.

1521
02:20:35,516 --> 02:20:40,452
However, there are passes through
the Apennine Mountains unknown to any map.

1522
02:20:42,555 --> 02:20:46,287
It may fortify your courage
to know

1523
02:20:46,959 --> 02:20:50,589
that Pompey is encamped
some 20 miles to the west

1524
02:20:51,264 --> 02:20:54,199
and that the army of Lucullus
approaches from the south

1525
02:20:54,267 --> 02:20:56,235
by forced night march.

1526
02:20:56,301 --> 02:21:00,499
Sir, allow us to pledge you
the most glorious victory of your career.

1527
02:21:00,572 --> 02:21:01,630
ALL: Aye!

1528
02:21:02,507 --> 02:21:04,305
I'm not after glory!

1529
02:21:05,510 --> 02:21:07,274
I'm after Spartacus.

1530
02:21:08,613 --> 02:21:11,105
And, gentlemen,
I mean to have him.

1531
02:21:12,584 --> 02:21:16,020
However, this campaign
is not alone to kill Spartacus.

1532
02:21:17,054 --> 02:21:19,682
It is to kill
the legend of Spartacus.

1533
02:21:22,126 --> 02:21:23,889
You may go, gentlemen.

1534
02:21:23,961 --> 02:21:26,089
Hail Crassus.
Hail Crassus.

1535
02:21:28,732 --> 02:21:30,928
Lentulus Batiatus
awaits Your Excellency.

1536
02:21:31,001 --> 02:21:32,992
Who?
The lanista, sir.

1537
02:21:33,671 --> 02:21:35,730
Ah! Admit him.

1538
02:21:39,075 --> 02:21:40,338
Most Blessed Highness,

1539
02:21:40,410 --> 02:21:43,846
as soon as I received your message I hurried
into your distinguished presence.

1540
02:21:43,913 --> 02:21:46,974
I'm glad you were able
to spare the time. Sit down.

1541
02:21:47,050 --> 02:21:49,075
Oh, how gracious.

1542
02:21:50,586 --> 02:21:52,953
I understand...
I'm informed

1543
02:21:53,756 --> 02:21:56,123
that Spartacus once trained
under your auspices.

1544
02:21:56,192 --> 02:21:57,250
Yes!

1545
02:21:57,327 --> 02:22:01,228
In fact, if it isn't too
subversive to say so,

1546
02:22:01,296 --> 02:22:03,765
I made him
what he is today.

1547
02:22:04,399 --> 02:22:06,493
You're to be
congratulated.

1548
02:22:06,902 --> 02:22:10,167
You're so
admirably qualified

1549
02:22:10,706 --> 02:22:13,607
to give me what up to now
I've not been able to obtain,

1550
02:22:13,675 --> 02:22:15,609
a physical description
of Spartacus.

1551
02:22:15,677 --> 02:22:16,906
Oh, yes.

1552
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:20,372
But you saw him.

1553
02:22:21,449 --> 02:22:23,178
What?
In the ring.

1554
02:22:24,986 --> 02:22:26,078
When?

1555
02:22:26,821 --> 02:22:30,450
When you visited my school
with those two charming ladies.

1556
02:22:32,393 --> 02:22:33,485
What!

1557
02:22:34,495 --> 02:22:36,793
I trust they're both
in good health.

1558
02:22:36,864 --> 02:22:39,958
They selected him to fight
against Draba, the negro.

1559
02:22:40,033 --> 02:22:41,466
I remember the negro.

1560
02:22:41,534 --> 02:22:45,130
You had good cause to.
If I... If I may say so,

1561
02:22:45,672 --> 02:22:48,300
a brilliant dagger thrust,
difficult angle.

1562
02:22:48,375 --> 02:22:49,501
Spartacus
was the opponent?

1563
02:22:49,576 --> 02:22:50,566
Yes.

1564
02:22:53,013 --> 02:22:54,878
What did he
look like?

1565
02:22:55,682 --> 02:22:58,242
That's a matter of some importance
to Your Highness?

1566
02:22:58,318 --> 02:23:02,151
Yes, to every man who loves Rome
and wishes to see her strong.

1567
02:23:03,422 --> 02:23:07,188
We're both Roman patriots.
You're a great one. I, of course, smaller.

1568
02:23:07,259 --> 02:23:09,819
We both believe
in Roman fair play.

1569
02:23:10,629 --> 02:23:11,892
You want
something from me.

1570
02:23:11,964 --> 02:23:15,491
I would be lacking
in respect for my conscience,

1571
02:23:15,567 --> 02:23:17,797
if I did not say that I wish
something from you.

1572
02:23:17,870 --> 02:23:19,235
Name your price.

1573
02:23:20,172 --> 02:23:22,003
If... Uh, no.

1574
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:25,068
When you win
your victory tomorrow,

1575
02:23:25,510 --> 02:23:27,979
presumably the survivors
will be auctioned off

1576
02:23:28,046 --> 02:23:31,743
in order to pay for the expenses
of this heroic expedition.

1577
02:23:32,650 --> 02:23:35,051
Could not the agent
for that sale

1578
02:23:35,119 --> 02:23:39,352
be he who shares this tiny moment
of history with Your Honor?

1579
02:23:41,592 --> 02:23:45,426
I authorize you to be the agent
for the sale of all survivors.

1580
02:23:46,129 --> 02:23:48,826
In return,
you will remain here

1581

what if it is Spartacus
who crosses the battlefield looking for you?

1590

In such circumstances,
I have no doubt you will be helping him.

until after the battle.

No, I don't.

No.

But no matter how many times
we beat them,

1607

they still seem to have another army
to send against us.

that has no ending.

I'll be honest with you.

1739
02:46:47,710 --> 02:46:51,168
She's not as unattractive
as I told you she was.

1740
02:46:51,246 --> 02:46:54,614
Dignity and honesty in one afternoon.
I hardly recognize you.

1741
02:46:55,784 --> 02:46:57,479
But she is
an impossible woman.

1742
02:46:57,552 --> 02:46:58,576
Beautiful?

1743
02:46:58,653 --> 02:47:00,747
Beautiful?
Well, beautiful.

1744
02:47:01,056 --> 02:47:03,855
The more chains you put on her,
the less like a slave she looks.

1745
02:47:03,925 --> 02:47:05,951
Proud?
Proud, proud.

1746
02:47:06,027 --> 02:47:10,930
You feel that she would surrender
to the right man which is irritating.

1747
02:47:11,932 --> 02:47:14,162
I like Crassus.

1748
02:47:14,235 --> 02:47:18,228
Let's save him from his agony.
Let's steal this woman.

1749
02:47:19,340 --> 02:47:21,741
Steal the woman? Why?

1750
02:47:21,809 --> 02:47:24,210
I can no longer hurt Crassus
in the Senate

1751
02:47:24,278 --> 02:47:28,010
but I can hurt him where he'll feel it most,
in his pride.

1752
02:47:28,082 --> 02:47:30,244
Attack our enemy
from within.

1753
02:47:30,317 --> 02:47:33,047
The scheme is excellent,
but I hope you're not suggesting

1754
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:35,281
that I steal the woman.

1755
02:47:35,355 --> 02:47:36,948
Yes!

1756
02:47:37,724 --> 02:47:40,887
Buy some horses
and a cart with a canopy.

1757
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:43,088
Bring her here by nightfall.

1758
02:47:43,329 --> 02:47:44,626
Oh, no.

1759
02:47:44,898 --> 02:47:48,527
Add courage
to your newfound virtues.

1760
02:47:50,737 --> 02:47:54,502
Would half a million sesterces
make you brave?

1761
02:47:56,809 --> 02:47:58,333
Half a million?

1762
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:04,115
Well, Crassus

1763
02:48:04,183 --> 02:48:07,710
does seem to dwindle
in the mind, but...

1764
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:11,319
Let's reduce him further.
A round million!

1765
02:48:12,024 --> 02:48:13,354
A million.

1766
02:48:14,225 --> 02:48:17,217
For such a sum,
I could bribe Jupiter himself!

1767
02:48:17,662 --> 02:48:19,824
With a lesser sum,
I have.

1768
02:48:19,897 --> 02:48:20,990
(DOOR OPENS)

1769
02:48:26,437 --> 02:48:30,704
Forgive the intrusion.
I'm not in the habit of coming uninvited.

1770
02:48:30,775 --> 02:48:32,743
You've always been
welcome here.

1771
02:48:32,810 --> 02:48:33,799
As a pupil.

1772
02:48:39,015 --> 02:48:40,415
You're not alone.

1773
02:48:40,984 --> 02:48:42,418
No.

1774
02:48:43,420 --> 02:48:45,718
This time
you've come to teach.

1775
02:48:48,058 --> 02:48:49,924
You've joined Crassus?

1776
02:48:51,061 --> 02:48:53,052
Am I arrested?
No.

1777
02:48:53,430 --> 02:48:57,229
But I must ask you to come with me
to the Senate immediately.

1778
02:48:58,467 --> 02:49:02,870
What I do,
I do not for myself but for Rome.

1779
02:49:02,938 --> 02:49:06,204
Rome? Poor,
helpless Rome.

1780
02:49:07,109 --> 02:49:11,103
Let's go and hear more
about Rome from Crassus.

1781
02:49:16,351 --> 02:49:18,786
Did you truly believe
500 years of Rome

1782
02:49:18,853 --> 02:49:22,380
could so easily be delivered
into the clutches of a mob?

1783
02:49:25,960 --> 02:49:30,022
Already the bodies of 6,000
crucified slaves

1784
02:49:30,098 --> 02:49:31,861
line the Appian Way.

1785
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:35,470
Tomorrow the last of their companions
will fight to the death

1786
02:49:35,537 --> 02:49:39,029
in the temple of my fathers,
as a sacrifice to them.

1787
02:49:39,573 --> 02:49:43,305
As those slaves have died,
so will your rabble

1788
02:49:43,377 --> 02:49:48,281
if they falter one instant in loyalty
to the new order.

1789
02:49:49,049 --> 02:49:51,313
The enemies of the state
are known.

1790
02:49:51,752 --> 02:49:55,518
Arrests are in progress.
The prisons begin to fill.

1791
02:49:55,956 --> 02:49:59,721
In every city and province,
lists of the disloyal have been compiled.

1792
02:50:00,526 --> 02:50:05,089
Tomorrow they will learn
the cost of their terrible folly,

1793
02:50:06,766 --> 02:50:08,256
their treason.

1794
02:50:09,268 --> 02:50:13,671
Where does my name appear on the list
of disloyal enemies of the state?

1795
02:50:14,807 --> 02:50:15,968
First.

1796
02:50:18,343 --> 02:50:21,745
Yet, upon you
I have no desire for vengeance.

1797
02:50:22,814 --> 02:50:25,306
Your property
shall not be touched.

1798
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:28,750
You will retain the rank
and title of Roman senator.

1799
02:50:29,087 --> 02:50:30,282
A house...

1800
02:50:31,256 --> 02:50:34,783
A farmhouse in Picenum
has been provided for your exile.

1801
02:50:35,527 --> 02:50:37,927
You may take your women
with you.

1802
02:50:39,296 --> 02:50:43,495
Why am I to be left
so conspicuously alive?

1803
02:50:44,268 --> 02:50:47,328
Your followers are deluded enough
to trust you.

1804
02:50:47,404 --> 02:50:51,170
I intend that you shall
speak to them tomorrow for
the sake of their own good,

1805
02:50:51,242 --> 02:50:54,234
their peaceful
and profitable future.

1806
02:50:54,812 --> 02:50:58,339
From time to time thereafter,
I may find it useful
to bring you back to Rome

1807
02:50:58,415 --> 02:51:00,474
to continue your duty to her,

1808
02:51:00,550 --> 02:51:04,919
to calm the envious spirit
and the troubled mind.

1809
02:51:05,588 --> 02:51:10,526
You will persuade them
to accept destiny and order,

1810
02:51:10,927 --> 02:51:13,191
and trust the gods!

1811
02:51:17,300 --> 02:51:18,665
You may go.

1812
02:51:30,145 --> 02:51:31,579
Halt!

1813
02:51:45,393 --> 02:51:46,382
(MEN SCREAMING)

1814
02:52:17,891 --> 02:52:20,223
Why hide behind
that stola, hmm?

1815
02:52:26,065 --> 02:52:27,555
That's better.

1816
02:52:28,133 --> 02:52:31,069
That dress took some weeks
of a woman's life.

1817
02:52:31,670 --> 02:52:36,130
You, above all people,
should respect the work
of slaves and wear it proudly.

1818
02:52:36,208 --> 02:52:37,539
Come here.

1819
02:52:52,490 --> 02:52:56,927
This belonged to a queen,
the Queen of Persia.

1820
02:52:58,596 --> 02:52:59,961
It's heavy.

1821
02:53:02,266 --> 02:53:04,996
In time you will
wear it lightly enough.

1822
02:53:18,115 --> 02:53:19,377
Sit down.

1823
02:53:23,019 --> 02:53:26,181
Will you have
some squab and honey?

1824
02:53:27,690 --> 02:53:28,850
No.

1825
02:53:29,458 --> 02:53:30,824
You'll enjoy it.

1826
02:53:32,595 --> 02:53:34,392
And a piece
of melon?

1827
02:53:39,034 --> 02:53:41,026
And some wine,
of course.

1828
02:53:43,005 --> 02:53:44,097
Eat.

1829
02:53:48,743 --> 02:53:49,733
(CHUCKLES)

1830
02:53:50,178 --> 02:53:53,773
I did not command you
to eat, I invited you.

1831
02:53:55,984 --> 02:54:00,387
You find the richness of your surroundings
makes conversation difficult?

1832
02:54:03,324 --> 02:54:04,815
Why am I
here?

1833
02:54:08,762 --> 02:54:10,253
Good question.

1834
02:54:11,265 --> 02:54:12,994
A woman's question.

1835
02:54:14,201 --> 02:54:17,660
I wish the answer could be as good
and straightforward.

1836
02:54:20,574 --> 02:54:23,373
The infant,
it thrives?

1837
02:54:24,545 --> 02:54:25,670
He thrives.

1838
02:54:25,745 --> 02:54:30,341
I purchased a wet nurse for him, yesterday.
I hope the milk agrees with him.

1839
02:54:33,019 --> 02:54:34,612
I sent her away.

1840
02:54:35,454 --> 02:54:37,946
I prefer to nurse
the child myself.

1841
02:54:39,025 --> 02:54:40,925
I'm not sure
I approve.

1842
02:54:42,595 --> 02:54:44,723
It ties you
to the old life.

1843
02:54:45,765 --> 02:54:48,824
I want you to begin
to look forward to the new.

1844
02:54:51,603 --> 02:54:54,129
I don't care
about my new life here.

1845
02:54:54,973 --> 02:54:58,136
You care about the life
of your child, don't you?

1846
02:54:59,144 --> 02:55:01,670
Why do you threaten me
with my baby?

1847
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:05,250
I belong to you.
You can take me anytime you wish.

1848
02:55:05,317 --> 02:55:07,978
But I don't want
to take you.

1849
02:55:09,220 --> 02:55:10,949
I want you to give.

1850
02:55:13,824 --> 02:55:15,849
I want your love,
Varinia.

1851
02:55:19,430 --> 02:55:23,526
You think by threatening
to kill my child you'll make me love you?

1852
02:55:23,834 --> 02:55:26,895
I did not threaten
to kill your child.

1853
02:55:34,143 --> 02:55:37,113
I'm sorry, Varinia.

1854
02:55:43,720 --> 02:55:45,916
One shouldn't grieve
forever.

1855
02:55:47,123 --> 02:55:50,149
I'm not grieving,
I'm remembering.

1856
02:55:51,159 --> 02:55:53,594
Do I interfere
with your memories?

1857
02:55:54,963 --> 02:55:56,158
Oh, no.

1858
02:55:56,465 --> 02:55:57,455
(SCOFFS)

1859
02:55:59,067 --> 02:56:03,835
You tread the ridge between truth and insult
with the skill of a mountain goat.

1860
02:56:04,239 --> 02:56:05,331
Well.

1861
02:56:07,709 --> 02:56:11,076
What do you remember,
when you think about Spartacus?

1862
02:56:13,547 --> 02:56:15,573
It doesn't distress you
to talk about him?

1863
02:56:16,083 --> 02:56:17,107
No.

1864
02:56:18,886 --> 02:56:20,252
Well, then,

1865
02:56:22,390 --> 02:56:26,690
what sort of a man
was he, really?

1866
02:56:31,898 --> 02:56:36,062
He was a man who began
all alone, like an animal.

1867
02:56:37,537 --> 02:56:39,028
Yet on the day he died,

1868
02:56:39,105 --> 02:56:42,837
thousands and thousands
would gladly have died in his place.

1869
02:56:43,443 --> 02:56:44,569
(CHUCKLES)

1870
02:56:44,644 --> 02:56:47,307
What was he?
Was he a god?

1871
02:56:48,848 --> 02:56:50,441
He wasn't a god.

1872
02:56:51,650 --> 02:56:55,211
He was a simple man.
A slave.

1873
02:56:59,325 --> 02:57:00,724
I loved him.

1874
02:57:01,427 --> 02:57:03,896
He was an outlaw!
A murderer!

1875
02:57:03,963 --> 02:57:07,694
An enemy to everything fine and decent
that Rome ever built!

1876
02:57:08,634 --> 02:57:10,500
Damn you!
You tell me.

1877
02:57:11,402 --> 02:57:12,631
Why did you love him?

1878
02:57:13,237 --> 02:57:14,671
I can't tell you.

1879
02:57:14,806 --> 02:57:17,969
I can't tell you things
you can never understand.

1880
02:57:19,344 --> 02:57:21,904
But I want to understand.

1881
02:57:22,847 --> 02:57:26,647
Don't you see?
I must understand.

1882
02:57:35,492 --> 02:57:37,893
You're afraid of him,
aren't you?

1883
02:57:42,265 --> 02:57:44,393
That's why
you want his wife,

1884
02:57:45,068 --> 02:57:48,095
to soothe your fear
by having something he had.

1885
02:57:50,440 --> 02:57:54,069
When you're so afraid,
nothing can help.

1886
02:57:54,910 --> 02:57:56,139
Nothing.

1887
02:58:04,954 --> 02:58:06,422
We shall see.

1888
02:58:31,179 --> 02:58:33,375
Could we have won,
Spartacus?

1889
02:58:35,683 --> 02:58:37,583
Could we ever
have won?

1890
02:58:42,222 --> 02:58:44,953
Just by fighting them,
we won something.

1891
02:58:48,429 --> 02:58:51,057
When just one man says
"No, I won't,"

1892
02:58:51,799 --> 02:58:53,562
Rome begins to fear.

1893
02:58:59,005 --> 02:59:01,633
We were tens of thousands
who said no.

1894
02:59:02,742 --> 02:59:04,767
That was
the wonder of it.

1895
02:59:05,611 --> 02:59:08,877
To have seen slaves
lift their heads from the dust,

1896
02:59:11,584 --> 02:59:16,248
to see them rise from their knees,
stand tall

1897
02:59:19,057 --> 02:59:21,048
with a song on their lips,

1898
02:59:22,894 --> 02:59:24,294
to hear them

1899
02:59:25,864 --> 02:59:29,232
storm through
the mountains shouting,

1900
02:59:31,870 --> 02:59:34,362
to hear them sing
along the plains.

1901
02:59:38,109 --> 02:59:39,906
And now they're dead.

1902

All of them.

Are you afraid to die,

Hmm.

1909
03:00:34,696 --> 03:00:36,995
No more than
I was to be born.

1910

Are you afraid?

Over there,

slowly, doesn't it?

You are he,
aren't you?

Gladiator,
I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus.

they'll fight tomorrow
in the temple of your ancestors.

1926
03:02:57,766 --> 03:03:00,758
They will fight now
for me. Here!

1927
03:03:01,303 --> 03:03:04,703
And to the death.
And the victor shall be crucified.

1928
03:03:05,673 --> 03:03:08,608
We will test this myth
of slave brotherhood.

1929

Don't give them
the pleasure of a contest.

I'll kill you

I won't let them crucify you.

Obey it.

it takes to die on a cross?

I love you like my son

He'll come back
and he'll be millions!

Spartacus would say

if he knew that the woman,
Varinia, and her child

are slaves
in my household?

Did you fear him,

Not when I fought him.
I knew he could be beaten.

But now I fear him,
even more than I fear you.

Yes, my dear Caesar.
You!

to the leader of the Senate.

We've been hiding.

make Crassus jealous.

Go and make my joy
complete.
