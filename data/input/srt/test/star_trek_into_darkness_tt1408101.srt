1
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,181
Damn it, man! That was our
ride! You just stunned our ride!

2
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:39,267
Oh, great.

3
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:41,561
Run!

4
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,277
What the hell did you take?

5
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,279
I have no idea,
but they were bowing to it.

6
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,281
Kirk to Shuttle One.

7
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:54,949
Locals are out of the kill zone.

8
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,326
You are clear. Repeat.

9
00:01:56,493 --> 00:02:00,163
Spock, get in there, neutralize the
volcano and let's get out of here.

10
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,214
We have to do this now!
I told the Captain

11
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,382
the shuttle wasn't built
for this kind of heat.

12
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,885
Captain, did the indigenous
life forms see you?

13
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,762
No, Mr. Spock, they did not.

14
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,096
The Prime Directive clearly states

15
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,389
there can be no interference

16
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:20,595
with the internal development
of alien civilizations.

17
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,143
I know what it says!
Which is why I'm running

18
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:23,747
through the jungle wearing a disguise!

19
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,399
Now drop off your
super ice cube and let's go! Kirk out!

20
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,818
You're good.

21
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:31,909
If we're gonna do this,
we've got to do it now!

22
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,364
This ash is killing our coils.

23
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:35,907
You sure you don't want me
to go instead?

24
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,076
That would be highly illogical
as I am already outfitted...

25
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:39,786
Spock, I was kidding.

26
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,873
- You got this.
- Guys! We have to go! Now!

27
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:55,260
They're trying to kill us!

28
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,720
They're trying to kill us, Jim!

29
00:02:58,263 --> 00:02:59,430
I'll see you in 90 seconds.

30
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,563
Do it, do it!

31
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,289
<i>Prerequisite change, 2-7-3...</i>

32
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,419
I can't hold this position.

33
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:30,962
Spock, I've got to pull you back up.

34
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,715
Negative. This is our only
chance to save this species.

35
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:35,566
If this volcano erupts, the planet dies.

36
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:40,388
Pull him back up. Now!

37
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,946
<i>Spock, are you okay?</i>

38
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:03,745
I am,

39
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,664
surprisingly, alive. Stand by.

40
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,875
We have to get him back.
I'll suit up. I'm gonna go down.

41
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,282
We have to abandon the shuttle.

42
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,170
- We can't just leave him, Sulu!
- We don't have a choice!

43
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:13,671
Uhura, I'm sorry.

44
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,757
Spock, we're going back
to the Enterprise.

45
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,921
<i>We'll get you out of there.</i>

46
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,676
Captain, I'm ditching the shuttle.

47
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,470
You've got to make it
to the Enterprise on your own.

48
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,888
<i>Wonderful!</i>

49
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,474
- Uhura! You ready to swim?
- I'm ready.

50
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:27,727
Jim!

51
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:31,564
Jim! The beach is that way!

52
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,358
I know! We're not going to the beach!

53
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,318
Oh, no, no, no!

54
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:41,240
I hate this!

55
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,533
I know you do!

56
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,370
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous it is

57
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,871
to hide a starship
on the bottom of the ocean?

58
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,373
We've been down here since last night!

59
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,817
The salt water's gonna ruin the...

60
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,751
Scotty! Where's Spock?

61
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:34,916
Still in the volcano, sir.

62
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,296
Captain on the bridge!

63
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:21,049
Lieutenant, do we have
an open channel to Mr. Spock?

64
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,384
The heat's frying his comms,
but we still have contact.

65
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,721
Spock?

66
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,973
I have activated the device, Captain.

67
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:30,099
When the countdown is complete,

68
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:31,642
the reaction should
render the volcano inert.

69
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,102
Yeah, and that's gonna render him inert!

70
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,479
Do we have use of the transporters?

71
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,230
- Negative, sir.
- Not with these magnetic fields.

72
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,899
I need to beam Spock back to the ship.

73
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,567
Give me one way to do it.

74
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,861
Maybe if we had a direct line of sight.

75
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:43,029
- If we got closer...
- Hold on, wee man!

76
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:44,757
You're talking about an active volcano!

77
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,365
Sir, if that thing erupts,

78
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,209
I cannae guarantee
we can withstand the heat!

79
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,328
I don't know that we can
maintain that kind of altitude.

80
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,913
Our shuttle was concealed
by the ash cloud,

81
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,331
<i>but the Enterprise is too large.</i>

82
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,458
If utilized in a rescue effort,

83
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,126
<i>it would be revealed
to the indigenous species.</i>

84
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,136
Spock, nobody knows
the rules better than you,

85
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,005
but there has got to be an exception.

86
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,382
None. Such action violates
the Prime Directive.

87
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,509
Shut up, Spock! We're trying
to save you, damn it!

88
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:08,304
Doctor, the needs of
the many outweigh the needs of the few.

89
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,515
Spock, we're talking about your life!

90
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,802
<i>The rule cannot be broken...</i>

91
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,268
Spock!

92
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,683
Try to get him back online.

93
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,773
Ninety seconds to detonations.

94
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:23,444
If Spock were here
and I were there, what would he do?

95
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,116
He'd let you die.

96
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,302
Spock!

97
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,304
You all right?

98
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,330
Captain, you let them see our ship.

99
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,891
He's fine.

100
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,976
<i>- Bridge to Captain Kirk.
- Yes, Lieutenant.</i>

101
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,187
Is Commander Spock on board, sir?

102
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,271
<i>Safely and soundly.</i>

103
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,134
Please notify him that his device

104
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:25,650
<i>has successfully detonated.</i>

105
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,778
<i>You hear that? Congratulations, Spock.</i>

106
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,155
You just saved the world.

107
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,157
You violated the Prime Directive.

108
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,826
Oh, come on, Spock.
They saw us. Big deal.

109
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,861
I can save her.

110
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,700
What did you say?

111
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,411
Your daughter.

112
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:26,372
I can save her.

113
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,833
Who are you?

114
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,812
Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go.

115
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:51,856
Jim!

116
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,817
You're not actually gonna
answer that, are you?

117
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,155
Spock, I'm telling you,
this is why he called. I can feel it.

118
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,782
Your feeling aside,
I consider it highly unlikely

119
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:04,034
that we will be selected
for the new program.

120
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,454
Why else would Pike want to see us?

121
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:07,913
Forget about seniority.

122
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,373
They gave us the newest ship
in the fleet.

123
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:10,624
I mean, who else
are they gonna send out?

124
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,709
I can think of numerous possibilities.

125
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,003
A five-year mission, Spock!

126
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,464
That's deep space!
That's uncharted territory!

127
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:17,548
Think how incredible that's gonna be.

128
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,217
Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.

129
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,304
- "Uneventful."
- Admiral?

130
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,148
It's the way you described the survey of
Nibiru in your captain's log.

131
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,309
Yes, sir, I didn't want to waste your time
going over the details.

132
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,311
Tell me more about this volcano.

133
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,770
Data says it was highly volatile.

134
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,397
If it were to erupt,
it would wipe out the planet.

135
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,773
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.

136
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,108
Something tells me it won't.

137
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:39,153
Well, sir, volatile is all relative.

138
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,905
Maybe our data was off.

139
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,281
Or maybe it didn't erupt

140
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,950
because Mr. Spock detonated
a cold fusion device

141
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:47,328
inside it right after a civilization

142
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,580
that's barely invented the wheel

143
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,625
happened to see a starship
rising out of their ocean!

144
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,877
That is pretty much how
you describe it, is it not?

145
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,712
- Admiral...
- You filed a report?

146
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,880
Why didn't you tell me?

147
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,763
I incorrectly assumed that you would be
truthful in your captain's log.

148
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,968
Yeah, I would have been
if I didn't have to save your life.

149
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,220
A fact for which I am
immeasurably grateful

150
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,864
and the very reason I felt it necessary

151
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,097
to take responsibility for the actions...

152
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,682
Take responsibility, yeah.

153
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:09,847
That'd be so noble, pointy,

154
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,352
if you weren't also
throwing me under the bus.

155
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,437
"Pointy"? Is that
a derogatory reference to...

156
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,772
Gentlemen.

157
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:19,068
Starfleet's mandate is to explore and
observe, not to interfere.

158
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:21,028
Had the mission gone
according to plan, Admiral,

159
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,279
the indigenous species would never

160
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,447
have been aware of our interference.

161
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:24,865
That's a technicality.

162
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,784
I am Vulcan, sir.
We embrace technicality.

163
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,494
Are you giving me attitude, Spock?

164
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,454
I'm expressing
multiple attitudes simultaneously, sir.

165
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:31,747
To which are you referring?

166
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:32,957
Out.

167
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,626
You're dismissed, Commander.

168
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:47,221
You have any idea what
a pain in the ass you are?

169
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,223
I think so, sir.

170
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,558
So tell me what you did wrong.

171
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,560
What's the lesson to be learned here?

172
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:54,144
Never trust a Vulcan.

173
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,730
Now, see, you can't
even answer the question. You lied.

174
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,732
On an official report, you lied.

175
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,234
You think the rules don't apply to you

176
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,527
'cause you disagree with them.

177
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,487
That's why you talked me
into signing up in the first place.

178
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:04,811
It's why you gave me your ship.

179
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:08,033
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.

180
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,579
And now, I see you haven't
got an ounce of humility.

181
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,913
What was I supposed to do,
let Spock die?

182
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,164
You're missing the point.

183
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,791
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?

184
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,759
I wouldn't have risked
my First Officer's life

185
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,128
in the first place!

186
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,088
You were supposed to survey a planet,

187
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,007
not alter its destiny!

188
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,175
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations

189
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:27,469
and almost got everyone
under your command killed.

190
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,013
Except I didn't!

191
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,431
You know how many
crew members I've lost? Not one!

192
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,516
That's your problem,
you think you're infallible!

193
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,767
You think you can't make a mistake.

194
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,102
It's a pattern with you!

195
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,438
- The rules are for other people!
- Some should be.

196
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,189
And what's worse is you using blind luck

197
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:41,442
to justify your playing God!

198
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,821
Given the circumstances,

199
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,944
this has been brought to
Admiral Marcus's attention.

200
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,701
He convened a special tribunal,
to which I was not invited.

201
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,537
You understand what Starfleet
regulations mandate

202
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,705
be done at this point.

203
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,836
<i>They've</i> taken <i>the Enterprise</i>
away <i>from</i> you.

204
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,048
They're sending you
back to the Academy.

205
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,220
Admiral, listen...

206
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,305
- No, I'm not going to listen.
- I can justify...

207
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,389
Why should I listen?
I'm not going to listen.

208
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,807
You don't listen to anybody but yourself!

209
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,643
I understand regulation,
but every decision I've made...

210
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:16,727
No! I can't listen!

211
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,562
You don't comply with the rules,

212
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:20,731
you don't take responsibility
for anything,

213
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,900
and you don't respect the chair.

214
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,403
You know why?

215
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,406
Because you're not ready for it.

216
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,163
I'm going to need three titanium...

217
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,208
<i>Radiation protection
is required in this area.</i>

218
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,734
How did you find me?

219
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,945
I know you better than you think I do.

220
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,950
The first time I found you
was in a dive like this.

221
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,912
Remember that? You got
your ass handed to you.

222
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,247
No, I didn't.

223
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,217
- You don't?
- No, that's not what happened.

224
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,710
- That was an epic beating.
- No, it wasn't.

225
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,795
You had napkins
hanging out of your nose.

226
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:13,964
Did you not?

227
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,968
Yeah, that was a good fight.

228
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,512
"A good fight."

229
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,767
I think that's your problem right there.

230
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,441
They gave her back to me.

231
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,610
<i>The Enterprise.</i>

232
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,331
Congratulations.

233
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,669
Watch your back with
that First Officer, though.

234
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,672
Spock's not going
to be working with me.

235
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,382
He's been transferred.

236
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,968
<i>U.S.S. Bradbury.</i>

237
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,348
You're going to be my First Officer.

238
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,517
Yeah, Marcus took some convincing.

239
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,189
But every now and then
I can make a good case.

240
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:16,985
What did you tell him?

241
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,779
The truth.

242
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,281
That I believe in you.

243
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,370
That if anybody
deserves a second chance, it's Jim Kirk.

244
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,714
I don't know what to say.

245
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,217
That is a first.

246
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,887
It's going to be okay, son.

247
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,063
"Emergency session, Daystrom."

248
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,899
That's us.

249
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,526
Yeah.

250
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,820
Suit up.

251
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,292
<i>All Starfleet personnel,
please be advised,</i>

252
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:17,295
<i>- new security protocols are in effect.
- Captain.</i>

253
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,464
Not anymore, Spock. First Officer.

254
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,260
I was demoted
and you were reassigned.

255
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,095
It is fortunate that the consequences

256
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,263
were not more severe.

257
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,681
You've got to be kidding me.

258
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:28,849
Captain, it was never my intention...

259
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,100
Not Captain.

260
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:31,518
I saved your life, Spock.

261
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,979
You wrote a report, I lost my ship.

262
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,525
Commander, I see now
I should have alerted you

263
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,277
to the fact that I submitted the report.

264
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,195
No, I'm familiar with your compulsion

265
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,990
to follow the rules.
But you see, I can't do that.

266
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,701
Where I come from,
if someone saves your life,

267
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,024
you don't stab him in the back.

268
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,787
Vulcans cannot lie.

269
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,539
Then I'm talking
to the half-human part of you.

270
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,207
All right?

271
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,752
Do you understand
why I went back for you?

272
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,297
Commander Spock?
Frank Abbot, <i>U.</i> S. S. Bradbury.

273
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:01,798
Guess you're with me.

274
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,968
Yes, Captain.

275
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,269
The truth is

276
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,689
I'm going to miss you.

277
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,325
<i>Admiral Marcus, sir.</i>

278
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:32,496
Thank you for convening
on such short notice.

279
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,830
Be seated.

280
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,752
By now, some of you
have heard what happened in London.

281
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,213
The target was a Starfleet data archive.

282
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,464
Now it's a damned hole in the ground,

283
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,341
42 men and women are dead.

284
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:45,592
One hour ago,

285
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,476
I received a message
from a Starfleet officer,

286
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,387
who confessed to
carrying out this attack,

287
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,182
that he was being
forced to do it by this man,

288
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:55,185
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.

289
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,355
And he is the man responsible
for this act of savagery.

290
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,108
For reasons unknown,
John Harrison has just declared

291
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,652
a one-man war against Starfleet.

292
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,531
And under no circumstances
are we to allow this man

293
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,199
to escape Federation space.

294
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,618
You here tonight represent
the senior command

295
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,453
of all the vessels in the region.

296
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,164
And in the name of those we lost,

297
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,542
you will run this bastard down.

298
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:22,879
This is a manhunt,
pure and simple, so let's get to work.

299
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,298
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

300
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,967
any warp signatures leaving the system,

301
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,385
so we know he can't be far.

302
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,721
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

303
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,266
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

304
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:37,144
to run down every lead.

305
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,020
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people,

306
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,648
so the rules of engagement are simple.

307
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,776
If you come across this man
and fear for your life

308
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,653
or the lives of those nearby,

309
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,781
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

310
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,575
- What's in the bag?
- James, not now.

311
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,902
It doesn't seem odd to you
that he'd target an archive?

312
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,412
It's like bombing a library.

313
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,205
Chris? Everything okay there?

314
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:00,208
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk is just acclimating

315
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,085
to his new position as First Officer.

316
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,837
You got something to say, Kirk, say it.

317
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,547
Tomorrow's too late.

318
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:08,753
I'm fine, sir. My apologies.

319
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:11,720
Spit it out, son. Don't be shy.

320
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,973
Why the archive?

321
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,767
All that information is public record.

322
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,895
If he really wanted to damage Starfleet,

323
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,690
this could just be the beginning.

324
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,317
The beginning of what, Mr. Kirk?

325
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,236
Sir, in the event
of an attack, protocol mandates

326
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,198
that senior command gather
captains and first officers

327
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,325
at Starfleet H.Q., right here

328
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,745
- in this room.
- It is curious Harrison

329
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,154
would commandeer a jumpship
without warp capabilities...

330
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,129
Clear the room!

331
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,510
No!

332
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,307
We need an air defense team!
Daystrom Conference Room!

333
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,518
- Let's go!
- Cover me!

334
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,695
- Target acquired.
- Take him out!

335
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,821
Watch my flank!

336
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,659
- Go, go, go!
- Cover me!

337
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,620
Fire!

338
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,823
Yeah?

339
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,451
<i>Commander,
Mr. Scott has found something</i>

340
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,411
<i>in the wreckage of Harrison's ship.</i>

341
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:31,080
<i>He has asked to see us right</i> away.

342
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,877
Captain!
I found this in the crashed jumpship, sir.

343
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,754
- This is how the bastard got away.
- What do you mean?

344
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,964
It's a portable
transwarp beaming device.

345
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:41,299
Well, can you figure out where he went?

346
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,302
I already did, sir.
And you're no gonna like it.

347
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,263
He's gone to the one place we...

348
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,641
We just can't go.

349
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,103
Admiral, sir, he's not on Earth.

350
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,525
He's on Kronos, sir.

351
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,193
I request my command be reinstated

352
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,153
and your permission to go after him.

353
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:04,822
Give us a minute.

354
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:07,408
- Kronos.
- Yes, sir.

355
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,994
So Harrison's gone
to the Klingon homeworld.

356
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,746
- Is he defecting?
- We're not sure, sir.

357
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,248
He has taken refuge
in the Ketha Province,

358
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:14,332
a region uninhabited for decades.

359
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:15,917
He's gotta be hiding there, sir!

360
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,710
He knows if we even
go near Klingon space,

361
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:18,795
it'd be all-out war.

362
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,172
Starfleet can't go after him, but I can.

363
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,466
Please, sir.

364
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,263
All-out war with
the Klingons is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

365
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:29,722
If you ask me, it's already begun.

366
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,391
Since we first learned of their existence,

367
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,601
the Klingon Empire
has conquered and occupied

368
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:34,852
two planets that we know of

369
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:37,480
and fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

370
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,150
They are coming our way.

371
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,154
London was not an archive.

372
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,156
It was a top-secret branch of Starfleet

373
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,784
designated Section 31.

374
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,411
They were developing
defense technology

375
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,413
and training our officers
to gather intelligence

376
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,956
on the Klingons
and any other potential enemy

377
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:57,333
who means to do us harm.

378
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,858
Harrison was one of our top agents.

379
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,296
Well, now he's a fugitive
and I want to take him out.

380
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,842
Pike always said you were
one of our best and brightest.

381
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,678
You should have heard him defend you.

382
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,036
He's the one who talked you
into joining Starfleet, wasn't he?

383
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,142
Yes, sir.

384
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,894
Did he ever tell you
who talked him into joining?

385
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,151
His death is on me.

386
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:25,820
And yours can't be.

387
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:26,946
Sir, please. All I...

388
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,531
Mr. Spock, you said the province

389
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,074
where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited?

390
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:31,784
Affirmative, sir.

391
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,664
As part of our defensive strategy,

392
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,042
31 developed a new photon torpedo.

393
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,087
Long-range and untraceable,

394
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:45,340
it would be invisible to Klingon sensors.

395
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:48,551
I don't want you hurt,
but I want to take him out.

396
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,511
You park on the edge
of the Neutral Zone,

397
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:52,472
you lock onto Harrison's position,

398
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,156
you fire, you kill him and you haul ass.

399
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,853
Permission to
reinstate Mr. Spock as my First Officer.

400
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:01,522
Granted.

401
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:10,239
Jim!

402
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,201
- Where were you?
- For what?

403
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,869
Your medical exam.

404
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,913
Ten hours ago, you were
in a damn firefight.

405
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,248
- Now it's my duty as ship's...
- I'm fine, Bones.

406
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,917
The hell you are.

407
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,420
I'm fine.

408
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,178
Status report, Mr. Spock.

409
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,596
<i>The Enterprise should be</i>
ready <i>for</i> launch

410
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,098
by the time we arrive.

411
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,475
- Good. Good.
- Captain.

412
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:40,812
Thank you for requesting
my reinstatement.

413
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:43,773
You're welcome.

414
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:46,776
As I am again
your First Officer, it is now my duty

415
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,703
to strongly object
to our mission parameters.

416
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:49,987
Of course it is.

417
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,531
There is no Starfleet regulation

418
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,294
that condemns a man
to die without a trial,

419
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,993
something you
and Admiral Marcus are forgetting.

420
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,371
Also, preemptively firing torpedoes

421
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,015
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

422
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:01,791
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

423
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,274
There's only gonna be one casualty.

424
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,502
And in case you weren't listening,

425
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,828
our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

426
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,423
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

427
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:11,634
Regulations aside,
this action is morally wrong.

428
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,387
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of a volcano was morally right.

429
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,555
And I didn't win any points for that.

430
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:16,723
Jim, calm down.

431
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,224
I'm not gonna take
ethics lessons from a robot!

432
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,059
Reverting to name-calling
suggests that you are defensive

433
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:21,477
and therefore find my opinion valid.

434
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:22,882
I wasn't asking for your opinion.

435
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,064
Bones, get that thing off my face.

436
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,859
Captain, our mission
could start a war with the Klingons

437
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,027
and it is, by its very definition, immoral.

438
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,751
Perhaps you should
take the requisite time

439
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,115
to arrive at this conclusion for yourself.

440
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,366
Captain Kirk.

441
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,161
Science Officer Wallace.

442
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,496
I've been assigned
to the Enterprise by Admiral Marcus.

443
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,498
These are my transfer orders.

444
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,376
You requested an additional
science officer, Captain?

445
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,586
I Wish I had.

446
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,465
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."

447
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:51,924
"Doctorate in applied physics"

448
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,927
"specializing in advanced weaponry."

449
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,053
Impressive credentials.

450
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,513
Thank you.

451
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:59,098
But redundant now that
I am back aboard the Enterprise.

452
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,641
And yet, the more the merrier.

453
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,810
- Have a seat, Doctor.
- Thank you.

454
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,399
Shuttle crew, stand by for lift-off.

455
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,506
No! I'm not signing anything!

456
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,800
Now, get these bloody things
off my ship! Captain!

457
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,083
Is there a problem, Mr. Scott?

458
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,096
Aye, sir. I was just
explaining to this gentleman

459
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,722
that I cannae authorize any
weapons on board this ship

460
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:40,932
without knowing what's inside them.

461
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,809
Mr. Scott raises yet another point...

462
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,018
Report to the bridge.

463
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:45,353
Captain.

464
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,396
Mr. Scott, I understand your concerns,

465
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,357
but we need these torpedoes on board.

466
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,026
Due respect, sir,
but photon torpedoes run on fuel.

467
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,694
Now, I cannae detect the type of fuel

468
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,571
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

469
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:56,697
because it's shielded.

470
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:59,116
Now, I asked for
the specifications, but he said...

471
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,244
- it's classified.
- It's classified.

472
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,412
So I said, "No specs, no signature!"

473
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:04,497
Captain.

474
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,874
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.

475
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,876
- Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

476
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:12,004
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.

477
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:13,756
Get down!

478
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:15,424
Jim, your vitals are way off.

479
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:17,844
Report to the med bay. Scotty!

480
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,512
I need you to approve those weapons.

481
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,596
Do you know what this is, Captain?

482
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,098
I don't have time for a lecture, Scotty.

483
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:25,017
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a warp core.

484
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:28,104
It's a radioactive
catastrophe waiting to happen.

485
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,147
A subtle shift in magnetic output

486
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:33,109
from, say, firing
one or more of six dozen torpedoes

487
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,652
with an unknown payload

488
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:36,195
could set off a chain reaction
which would kill

489
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:37,947
every living thing on this ship.

490
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:40,575
Letting those torpedoes on board the
Enterprise is the last straw!

491
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,493
- What was the first straw?
- What was the...

492
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,412
There are plenty of straws.

493
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:47,123
How about Starfleet
confiscating my transwarp equation?

494
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,458
And now some madman's
using it to hop across the galaxy!

495
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,626
Where do you think he got it from?

496
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,044
We have our orders, Scotty!

497
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,963
That's what scares me.

498
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,716
This is clearly a military operation.

499
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,593
Is that what we are now?

500
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:00,076
'Cause I thought we were explorers.

501
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:03,180
Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order.

502
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,142
Right, well, you leave me no choice

503
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:07,518
but to resign my duties.

504
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:09,145
Come on, Scotty.

505
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:10,855
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...

506
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,064
You're not giving me much of a choice.

507
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,441
Will you just
make an exception and sign...

508
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:14,964
Do you accept my resignation or not?

509
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,193
I do!

510
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,826
I do.

511
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:28,039
You are relieved, Mr. Scott.

512
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:43,512
Jim, for the love of God,
do not use those torpedoes.

513
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:59,153
<i>Attention. Warp core
anti-matter containment check</i>

514
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,696
<i>in three minutes.</i>

515
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,036
<i>Captain! I'm so sorry
about Admiral Pike.</i>

516
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:08,746
We all are.

517
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,248
- Are you okay?
- Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.

518
00:38:19,757 --> 00:38:21,384
Actually, Scotty just quit.

519
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:26,430
And your boyfriend's second-guessing
me every chance he gets.

520
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,185
I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.

521
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:34,939
It's just sometimes
I want to rip the bangs off his head.

522
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,275
- You know, maybe it's me. I...
- It's not you.

523
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:41,070
It's not?

524
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:45,866
Wait, are you guys...
Are you guys fighting?

525
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,951
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.

526
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:49,120
Oh, my God! What is that even like?

527
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,002
Your ears burning?

528
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:57,169
Captain on the bridge!

529
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,046
Captain.

530
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,758
Mr. Chekov. You've been
shadowing Mr. Scott.

531
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:05,177
You are familiar with
the engineering systems of this ship?

532
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,262
Affirmative, sir.

533
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:07,430
Good.

534
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:11,183
You're my new Chief.
Go put on a red shirt.

535
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,272
Aye, Captain.

536
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:21,902
Retract all moorings, Mr. Sulu.

537
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:24,196
Yes, sir.

538
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,995
<i>Docking clamps one, two,
and three are released.</i>

539
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,079
<i>All moorings retracted.</i>

540
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,550
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a shipwide channel.

541
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:45,634
Yes, sir.

542
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,012
<i>Mr. Chekov,
how we looking down there?</i>

543
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,556
- All systems nominal, Captain.
- Copy <i>that.</i>

544
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,141
Warp available at your command.

545
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,809
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chekov.</i>

546
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,479
- All right. Let's ride.
- Yes, sir.

547
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,285
Channel open, sir.

548
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,580
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

549
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,874
As most of you know, Christopher Pike,

550
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,877
former captain of this ship
and our friend,

551
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:23,005
is dead.

552
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,674
The man who killed him
has fled our system

553
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,510
and is hiding on the Klingon homeworld,

554
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:30,221
<i>somewhere he believes
we are unwilling to go.</i>

555
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,225
<i>We are on our way there now.</i>

556
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,229
<i>Per Admiral Marcus, it is essential
that our presence go undetected.</i>

557
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:39,939
<i>Tensions between the Federation</i>

558
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:41,732
<i>and the Klingon Empire have been high.</i>

559
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,151
<i>Any provocation could lead
to an all-out war.</i>

560
00:40:57,915 --> 00:40:59,875
I will personally lead a landing party

561
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,586
to an abandoned city
on the surface of Kronos

562
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:06,590
where we will capture
the fugitive, John Harrison,

563
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:10,761
and return him to Earth
so he can face judgment for his actions.

564
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,976
All right. Let's go
get this son of a bitch. Kirk out.

565
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,775
Captain, I believe you have
made the right decision.

566
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:25,899
If I can be of assistance,

567
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,068
I would be happy to accompany
you on the away team.

568
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,740
You? Happy?

569
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:34,577
I was simply attempting to use your
vernacular to convey an idea.

570
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,455
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

571
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:51,218
<i>All personnel, prepare for the
closing of payload bay doors.</i>

572
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:01,103
Mr. Spock. You startled me.

573
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:03,606
What are you doing, Doctor?

574
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:05,608
- Verifying that the torpedo's internal...
- You misunderstand.

575
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,776
What are you doing aboard this ship?

576
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,696
There is no record
of you being assigned to the Enterprise.

577
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,198
Really? That must be
some sort of mistake.

578
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:14,617
My conclusion as well, Dr. Marcus.

579
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:18,162
Except that you have lied
about your identity.

580
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,748
Wallace is the surname of your mother.

581
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:23,083
I can only assume
the Admiral is your father.

582
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:27,796
Mr. Spock.

583
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,883
I'm aware that I have
no right to ask this of you.

584
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:34,136
But please, he cannot
know that I'm here...

585
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:44,063
Engineering manually
dropped us out of warp, sir.

586
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:45,898
Mr. Chekov, did you break my ship?

587
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,608
Sorry, sir. I don't know what happened!

588
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,817
The core overheated.

589
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:50,569
I had to activate the emergency stop.

590
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,279
It must be a coolant leak.
I need time to find it.

591
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:54,615
<i>- Sorry, Captain.
- Damn it.</i>

592
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:57,159
Mr. Sulu, time to our destination.

593
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,577
Twenty minutes, sir.

594
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,862
That's 20 minutes
in enemy space we weren't counting on.

595
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,539
All right. We better hop to it.

596
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,124
- Where's Spock?
- Here, Captain.

597
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,168
You're coming with me to Kronos.

598
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:07,253
Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?

599
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,620
- It's rusty, but it's good.
- Good, you're coming, too.

600
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:13,133
This isn't going to be a problem, is it,
you two working together?

601
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,843
Absolutely not.

602
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,555
Unclear.

603
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:20,794
I'll meet you in the shuttle bay.

604
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,186
Jim, you're not actually
going down there, are you?

605
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:27,856
You don't rob a bank
when the getaway car has a flat tire.

606
00:43:29,066 --> 00:43:30,567
I'm sure engineering
will have us all patched up

607
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:31,694
by the time we get back.

608
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,821
<i>Isn't that right, Mr. Chekov?</i>

609
00:43:33,904 --> 00:43:34,905
Yes, Captain.

610
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:36,407
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

611
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:39,785
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

612
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,549
Once we're en route,
I want you to transmit

613
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,873
a targeted comm burst
to Harrison's location.

614
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,501
You tell him you have a bunch
of real big torpedoes pointed at his head

615
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:50,379
and if he doesn't play nice,
you're not afraid to use them.

616
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:52,298
- Is that a problem?
- No, sir.

617
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:54,216
I've just never sat in the chair before.

618
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:57,052
You're gonna do great.

619
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:00,222
Jim! Wait!

620
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,850
You just sat that man down
at a high-stakes poker game

621
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,060
with no cards and told him to bluff.

622
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,563
Now Sulu's a good man,
but he is no captain.

623
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,930
For the next two hours, he is.

624
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:10,941
And enough with the metaphors, all
right? That's an order.

625
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,569
Mr. Sulu, make sure
that K'normian ship is ready to fly.

626
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,622
Acting Captain Sulu to Shuttle Bay 2.

627
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,541
<i>Please have the trade ship
we confiscated</i>

628
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:30,169
<i>during the Mudd incident last month
fueled and flight ready.</i>

629
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:32,421
<i>Captain Kirk is en route to you now.</i>

630
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,468
Ready to deploy, Captain.

631
00:44:37,593 --> 00:44:39,261
Lieutenants, lose the red shirts.

632
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,396
You are K'normian arms dealers.
Put those on.

633
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,408
- Sir?
- Look, if this thing goes south,

634
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:45,351
there can be nothing
tying us to Starfleet.

635
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:47,895
Unless of course you want to
start a war, Mr. Hendorff.

636
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:50,356
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

637
00:44:50,564 --> 00:44:51,648
Good. Me, neither.

638
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:12,252
I am detecting
a single life sign in the Ketha Province.

639
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:14,421
Given the information
provided by Mr. Scott,

640
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:15,866
this is most likely John Harrison.

641
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:17,549
Mr. Sulu, I think we found our man.

642
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:18,884
You let him know you mean business.

643
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,135
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

644
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:24,014
Attention, John Harrison.

645
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:27,393
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu
of the <i>U.</i> S. S. Enterprise.

646
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:31,939
A shuttle of highly trained officers
is on its way to your location.

647
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:35,109
<i>If you do not surrender
to them immediately,</i>

648
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:39,405
<i>I will unleash the entire payload
of advanced long-range torpedoes</i>

649
00:45:39,488 --> 00:45:41,532
<i>currently locked onto your location.</i>

650
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,077
<i>You have two minutes
to confirm your compliance.</i>

651
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:48,038
<i>Refusal to do so will result
in your obliteration.</i>

652
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,544
If you test me, you will fail.

653
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:59,383
Mr. Sulu,

654
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:02,052
remind me never to piss you off.

655
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:08,767
We will arrive at Harrison's location

656
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:10,185
in three minutes, Captain.

657
00:46:10,436 --> 00:46:11,937
It is unlikely that he will come willingly.

658
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,816
I calculate the odds
of him attempting to kill us at 91.6%.

659
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:17,067
Fantastic.

660
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:19,046
Good thing you don't care about dying.

661
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:22,573
I am sorry, Lieutenant.
I could not hear what you said.

662
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:24,199
I didn't say anything.

663
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:27,119
Actually, I'd be happy to speak

664
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:28,203
- if you're willing to listen to me.
- Guys...

665
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,913
Lieutenant, I would prefer
to discuss this in private.

666
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,373
You'd prefer not to discuss this at all.

667
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,541
Our current circumstances...

668
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,042
Are you really gonna do this right now?

669
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:35,627
What never seems to require
your undivided focus...

670
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,212
I'm sorry, Captain, just two seconds.

671
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:38,630
- Okay.
- Is us.

672
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:40,966
At that volcano, you didn't
give a thought to us.

673
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:43,552
What it would do to me
if you died, Spock.

674
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:46,597
You didn't feel anything.

675
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:48,891
You didn't care.

676
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:51,810
And I'm not the only one who's upset
with you. The Captain is, too.

677
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:54,563
No, no, no. Don't drag me into this.

678
00:46:56,148 --> 00:46:57,357
She is right.

679
00:46:57,524 --> 00:47:00,527
Your suggestion that
I do not care about dying is incorrect.

680
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:02,279
A sentient being's optimal chance

681
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:04,490
at maximizing their utility
is a long and prosperous life.

682
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:05,574
Great.

683
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,284
Not exactly a love song, Spock.

684
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,452
You misunderstand.

685
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,997
It is true I chose not to feel anything

686
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,958
upon realizing that
my own life was ending.

687
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:17,336
As Admiral Pike was dying,

688
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:19,296
I joined with his consciousness

689
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,258
and experienced what he felt
at the moment of his passing.

690
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:26,470
Anger. Confusion.

691
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:27,971
Loneliness.

692
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,098
Fear

693
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:33,477
I had experienced those feelings before,

694
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:35,562
multiplied exponentially

695
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:38,315
on the day my planet was destroyed.

696
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,777
Such a feeling is something I choose

697
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,987
never to experience again.

698
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:49,993
Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel

699
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:52,829
as a reflection of my not caring.

700
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:57,543
Well, I assure you,
the truth is precisely the opposite.

701
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:04,841
What the hell was that?

702
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:06,927
What happened? Where's their signal?

703
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,179
It cut out. I'm working to get them back.

704
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:15,561
We are being pursued by
a D-4 class Klingon vessel.

705
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:16,728
I thought this sector was abandoned!

706
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:17,980
It must be a random patrol.

707
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,147
Hold on!

708
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:24,403
This ship has no offensive capabilities.

709
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:26,321
It's got us. Give me all six fuel cells.

710
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:27,406
Aye, Captain.

711
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:42,838
Damn it!

712
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:46,842
They're closing fast, bearing 285!

713
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:51,391
All right, there! There!
We can lose them there.

714
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:54,434
If you are suggesting
that we utilize the passage

715
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:55,559
between the approaching structures,

716
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:57,519
- this ship will not fit.
- We'll fit.

717
00:48:57,686 --> 00:49:00,647
- Captain, we will not fit.
- We'll fit, we'll fit!

718
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:21,168
- I told you we'd fit.
- I am not sure that qualifies.

719
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,214
Any sign of them?

720
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:27,924
- No. Which worries me.
- We lost them!

721
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,371
Or they're jamming our scanners.

722
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,385
Or we lost them.

723
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,739
They're ordering us to land.

724
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:54,741
Captain, they're gonna
want to know why we're here.

725
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:57,204
And they're gonna torture us.

726
00:49:57,371 --> 00:49:58,914
Question us.

727
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:00,582
And they're gonna kill us.

728
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:04,461
So we come out shooting.

729
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:10,634
We're outnumbered, outgunned.

730
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:13,929
There's no way we survive
if we attack first.

731
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,808
You brought me here
because I speak Klingon.

732
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:20,811
Then let me speak Klingon.

733
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,569
This isn't going to work.

734
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:12,654
It is our only logical option.

735
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:15,782
And if you interrupt her now, you will
not only incur the wrath of the Klingons

736
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:18,493
but that of Lieutenant Uhura as well.

737
00:51:30,602 --> 00:51:33,567
<i>I am here to help you...</i>

738
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:02,634
- Stand down.
- How many torpedoes?

739
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:03,718
Stand down!

740
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:07,222
The torpedoes, the weapons you
threatened me with in your message.

741
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:08,807
How many are there?

742
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:11,726
Seventy-two.

743
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,068
I surrender.

744
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,962
On behalf of Christopher Pike,

745
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:40,588
my friend,

746
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:42,882
I accept your surrender.

747
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:09,284
Captain!

748
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,960
Captain.

749
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,182
Cuff him.

750
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:54,329
<i>- Bones, meet me in the</i> brig.
<i>- Be right there.</i>

751
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:55,872
Lieutenant.

752
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:59,834
Contact Starfleet, let them know
we have Harrison in custody,

753
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:02,712
and we'll be on our way once
the warp core is repaired.

754
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,089
Yes, sir.

755
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,690
<i>- Why the hell did he surrender?
- I don't know.</i>

756
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:24,651
But he just took out a squad
of Klingons single-handedly.

757
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:25,819
I want to know how.

758
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:28,279
Sounds like we have
a superman on board.

759
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:29,697
You tell me.

760
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:40,166
Put your arm through the hole.
I'm gonna take a blood sample.

761
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,433
Why aren't we moving, Captain?

762
00:57:58,768 --> 00:58:01,813
An unexpected malfunction,
perhaps in your warp core

763
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,899
conveniently stranding you
on the edge of Klingon space?

764
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:07,235
- How the hell do you know that?
- Bones.

765
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:11,406
I think you'd find
my insight valuable, Captain.

766
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:15,702
- We good?
- Yeah.

767
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:17,370
Let me know what you find.

768
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,417
Ignore me and you
will get everyone on this ship killed.

769
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:31,509
Captain, I believe
he will only attempt to manipulate you.

770
00:58:31,718 --> 00:58:33,887
I would not recommend
engaging the prisoner further.

771
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,471
Give me a minute.

772
00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:50,195
Let me explain what's happening here.

773
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,322
You are a criminal.

774
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:54,991
I watched you murder
innocent men and women.

775
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:57,660
I was authorized to end you!

776
00:58:58,036 --> 00:59:01,331
And the only reason
why you are still alive

777
00:59:01,456 --> 00:59:03,041
is because I am allowing it.

778
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:06,044
So shut your mouth.

779
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:08,963
Oh, Captain, are you going
to punch me again

780
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:11,966
over and over till your arm weakens?

781
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,385
Clearly you want to, so tell me,

782
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,889
why did you allow me to live?

783
00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:19,307
We all make mistakes.

784
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:22,143
No. I surrendered to you because,

785
00:59:22,227 --> 00:59:24,229
despite your attempt
to convince me otherwise,

786
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:27,232
you seem to have
a conscience, Mr. Kirk.

787
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,902
If you did not,
then it would be impossible for me

788
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:33,071
to convince you of the truth.

789
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:38,910
23-17-46-11.

790
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:42,330
Coordinates not far from Earth.

791
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:45,833
If you want to know why I did what I did,

792
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:47,252
go and take a look.

793
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:50,338
Give me one reason
why I should listen to you.

794
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:52,507
I can give you 72.

795
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:55,593
And they're on board your ship, Captain.

796
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:59,222
They have been all along.

797
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:02,392
I suggest you open one up.

798
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:19,951
Hi!

799
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:30,336
You know what really
bothers me, though?

800
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,089
It's the modifications,
you know, the enhancements.

801
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:36,175
Right? And then like that,
I'm off the ship!

802
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:38,428
Just for trying to do what's right!

803
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:40,596
And what did you do anyway?

804
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:41,764
You just stood there like an oyster,

805
01:00:42,015 --> 01:00:43,224
looking at me!

806
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:44,350
What?

807
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:45,935
Scotty, it's Kirk.

808
01:00:46,102 --> 01:00:47,562
Well now!

809
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:50,648
If it isn't Captain James
Tiberius Perfect Hair!

810
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:52,567
<i>Did you hear that?
I called him Perfect Hair.</i>

811
01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:54,110
<i>- Where are you?
- Where are you?</i>

812
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:55,361
Are you drunk?

813
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:58,531
What I do in my private time
is my business, Jimbo.

814
01:00:58,614 --> 01:00:59,949
I need you to help me out
with something.

815
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:01,367
Will you take these coordinates down?

816
01:01:01,451 --> 01:01:04,579
23-17-46-11.

817
01:01:05,163 --> 01:01:06,205
<i>Are you writing?</i>

818
01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:08,333
What, you don't think
I can remember four numbers?

819
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:12,545
Ye of little faith.
What was the third one?

820
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,672
<i>Forty-six.</i>

821
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:17,633
I don't know exactly
what you're looking for,

822
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:20,928
but I have a feeling you'll know it
when you see it.

823
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:23,765
You may have been right
about those torpedoes.

824
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:27,894
I will consider that an apology.

825
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:29,771
And I will consider that apology.

826
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,398
You are the one who quit.

827
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:34,233
You made me quit!

828
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,110
Mr. Scott?

829
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:37,904
Scott.

830
01:01:39,155 --> 01:01:40,948
The nerve of that guy!

831
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:45,453
I am not doing that man any favors!

832
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,788
No!

833
01:01:47,663 --> 01:01:48,956
All right, then!

834
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:51,084
Are you out of your corn-fed mind?

835
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,960
You're not actually going
to listen to this guy?

836
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:54,962
He killed Pike, he almost killed you,

837
01:01:55,046 --> 01:01:57,298
and now you think
it's a good idea to pop open a torpedo

838
01:01:57,382 --> 01:01:58,549
because he dared you to.

839
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,468
Why did he save our lives, Bones?

840
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,220
The Doctor does have a point, Captain.

841
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:04,722
Don't agree with me, Spock.
It makes me very uncomfortable.

842
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:07,725
Perhaps you, too, should learn
to govern your emotions, Doctor.

843
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:09,102
In this situation, logic dictates...

844
01:02:09,185 --> 01:02:11,229
Logic? Oh, my God! There's a maniac

845
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,980
trying to make us blow up
our own damn ship and...

846
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:14,816
That's not it.
I don't know why he surrendered,

847
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:16,317
but that's not it.

848
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:18,736
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.
The question is how.

849
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,405
But, Jim, without Mr. Scott on board,

850
01:02:20,488 --> 01:02:21,906
who exactly is qualified

851
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,200
to just pop open
a four-ton stick of dynamite?

852
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:25,910
The Admiral's daughter
appeared to have interest

853
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:27,995
in the torpedoes
and she is a weapons specialist.

854
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,540
Perhaps she could be of some use.

855
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,375
What Admiral's daughter?

856
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,919
Carol Marcus. Your new science officer

857
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:36,838
concealed her identity to board the ship.

858
01:02:37,422 --> 01:02:39,382
When were you going to tell me that?

859
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:41,634
When it became relevant. As it just did.

860
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:43,302
Are the torpedoes in the weapons bay?

861
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:44,947
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?

862
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:46,514
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

863
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,890
onto your ship to find out why.

864
01:02:47,974 --> 01:02:49,684
I do apologize for that.

865
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,562
By the way, if I caused you
any problems, I am sorry.

866
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:54,063
I'm Carol Marcus.

867
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,232
- James Kirk.
- Torpedoes.

868
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,277
My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

869
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,029
then I heard he was
developing these prototype torpedoes.

870
01:03:02,113 --> 01:03:05,700
When I went to confront him about it,
he wouldn't even see me.

871
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,910
That's when I discovered
the torpedoes had disappeared

872
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:10,121
from all official records.

873
01:03:10,455 --> 01:03:12,123
And then he gave them to me.

874
01:03:12,248 --> 01:03:15,209
You're much cleverer than
your reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

875
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,003
I have a reputation?

876
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:19,213
Yes, you do. I'm a friend
of Christine Chapel's.

877
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:21,215
Christine, yes. How is she?

878
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:23,342
She transferred to the
outer frontier to be a nurse.

879
01:03:23,426 --> 01:03:24,469
She's much happier now.

880
01:03:24,552 --> 01:03:25,553
That's good.

881
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:28,055
You have no idea
who I'm talking about, do you?

882
01:03:29,015 --> 01:03:30,055
What are we doing in here?

883
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,058
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?

884
01:03:31,184 --> 01:03:32,477
Of course it is.

885
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,228
- Would you please turn around?
- Why?

886
01:03:35,146 --> 01:03:36,647
Just turn around.

887
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:39,734
It's too dangerous to try and open

888
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:41,736
one of these torpedoes
on the Enterprise.

889
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:44,572
But there is a nearby planetoid.

890
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,240
I can open one up there.

891
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:48,284
But I will need some help.

892
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,203
Turn around.

893
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:52,497
Now!

894
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:55,500
Captain on the bridge!

895
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,210
Mr. Sulu,

896
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:59,754
have Doctors Marcus and McCoy
landed on the planetoid yet?

897
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:02,507
Yes, sir. They're moving the
torpedo into position now.

898
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,842
Good. Any activity from the Klingons?

899
01:04:04,926 --> 01:04:06,219
Not yet.

900
01:04:06,344 --> 01:04:08,505
But if we're stuck
here much longer, they will find us.

901
01:04:09,263 --> 01:04:10,983
Lieutenant Uhura,
did you let Starfleet know

902
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:12,600
we have Harrison in custody?

903
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,685
Yes, sir. No response yet.

904
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:17,438
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

905
01:04:17,522 --> 01:04:19,774
<i>Hello. Captain, can you hear me?</i>

906
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:21,609
Mr. Chekov, give me some good news.

907
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:25,196
We found the leak, sir,
but the damage is substantial.

908
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:26,280
We're working on it.

909
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:28,115
<i>Any idea what caused it?</i>

910
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:32,370
No, sir. But I accept full responsibility.

911
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:37,708
Something tells me
it wasn't your fault. Stay on it.

912
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:39,877
Shuttle is standing by, Captain.

913
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:42,338
Bones, thanks for helping out.

914
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,632
Dr. Marcus asked
for the steadiest hands on the ship.

915
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,217
You know, when I dreamt
about being stuck

916
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,344
on a deserted planet
with a gorgeous woman,

917
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:49,804
there was no torpedo!

918
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,557
<i>Dr. McCoy, may I remind you,
you are not there to flirt.</i>

919
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,184
So how can these legendary
hands help you, Dr. Marcus?

920
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:56,352
<i>Bones!</i>

921
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:58,312
To understand how
powerful these weapons are,

922
01:04:58,396 --> 01:04:59,517
we need to open the warhead.

923
01:04:59,564 --> 01:05:01,190
To do that, we need to
access the fuel compartment.

924
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:02,275
Unfortunately for us,

925
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:04,944
the warheads on these
weapons are live.

926
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:06,070
Sweetheart, I once performed

927
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:08,531
an emergency C-section
on a pregnant Gorn.

928
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:09,615
Octuplets.

929
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:11,867
And let me tell you,
those little bastards bite.

930
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:14,662
I think I can work
some magic on your missile.

931
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:17,623
Dr. McCoy,
there's a bundle of fiber optic cables

932
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:19,125
against the inner casing.

933
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,168
You'll need to cut the 23rd wire down.

934
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:22,972
Whatever you do,
do not touch anything else.

935
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,046
Do you understand?

936
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,048
Right. The thought
never crossed my mind.

937
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:27,341
Dr. McCoy,

938
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:29,468
<i>wait for my word.</i>

939
01:05:29,594 --> 01:05:31,470
<i>I'm rerouting the detonation processor.</i>

940
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:33,639
- Are you ready?
- And raring.

941
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:34,724
Good luck.

942
01:05:35,725 --> 01:05:37,560
Sir, the torpedo just armed itself.

943
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:39,145
The warhead's gonna
detonate in 30 seconds, sir!

944
01:05:39,228 --> 01:05:41,564
What the hell happened?
I can't get my arm out!

945
01:05:41,897 --> 01:05:43,232
Target their signal.
Beam them back right now.

946
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:47,111
The transporter cannot differentiate
between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.

947
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:48,946
We cannot beam back one
without the other.

948
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:50,656
Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it?

949
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,992
I'm trying. I'm trying-

950
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:54,535
Jim, get her the hell out of here!

951
01:05:54,619 --> 01:05:56,287
No! If you beam me back, he dies!

952
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:57,872
<i>Just let me do it!</i>

953
01:05:58,247 --> 01:05:59,915
Ten. Nine.

954
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:01,083
Eight.

955
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:03,753
Standing by to transport
Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.

956
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:05,630
Four. Three.

957
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,881
Shit!

958
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,972
Deactivation successful, Captain.

959
01:06:16,307 --> 01:06:17,808
Dr. McCoy, are you all right?

960
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:24,398
<i>Bones!</i>

961
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:26,651
Jim?

962
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:29,737
You're going to want to see this.

963
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:38,639
<i>Delta team, deliver your
thrusters to loading dock 12.</i>

964
01:07:39,557 --> 01:07:41,308
U.S.S. Vengeance, <i>bridge crew</i>

965
01:07:41,392 --> 01:07:43,728
<i>requesting entry to construction hangar.</i>

966
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:47,628
<i>You are cleared to enter the hangar.</i>

967
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:59,910
<i>I need a welding team
on the number one nacelle.</i>

968
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:04,749
Holy...

969
01:08:06,751 --> 01:08:07,752
What have we got?

970
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:08,958
It's quite clever actually.

971
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:11,088
This fuel container's been
removed from the torpedo

972
01:08:11,172 --> 01:08:13,841
and retrofitted to hide this cryo tube.

973
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:17,303
- Is he alive?
- He's alive.

974
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:19,555
But if we try to revive him

975
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:22,057
without the proper sequencing,
it could kill him.

976
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:23,934
This technology's beyond me.

977
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:25,561
How advanced, Doctor?

978
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:28,189
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.

979
01:08:28,856 --> 01:08:31,776
We haven't needed to freeze anyone
since we developed warp capability,

980
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:35,196
which explains the most interesting
thing about our friend here.

981
01:08:36,197 --> 01:08:37,531
He's 300 years old.

982
01:08:46,415 --> 01:08:48,209
Why is there a man in that torpedo?

983
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,586
There are men and women

984
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:52,463
in all those torpedoes, Captain.

985
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,256
I put them there.

986
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:58,511
Who the hell are you?

987
01:09:02,598 --> 01:09:05,267
A remnant of a time long past.

988
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:08,395
Genetically engineered to be superior

989
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,440
so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

990
01:09:12,608 --> 01:09:17,613
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

991
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:20,699
For centuries we slept,

992
01:09:21,784 --> 01:09:25,454
hoping when we awoke,
things would be different.

993
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:28,040
But as a result
of the destruction of Vulcan,

994
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,459
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

995
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:31,794
distant quadrants of space.

996
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:34,630
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.

997
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:36,465
I looked up "John Harrison."

998
01:09:36,674 --> 01:09:38,035
Until a year ago, he didn't exist.

999
01:09:38,092 --> 01:09:41,637
John Harrison was a fiction
created the moment I was awoken

1000
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,932
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

1001
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:48,602
A smokescreen
to conceal my true identity.

1002
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:51,856
My name is

1003
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:53,399
Khan.

1004
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:00,948
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1005
01:10:01,282 --> 01:10:04,952
ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help?

1006
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:07,746
Because I am better.

1007
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:10,291
- At what?
- Everything.

1008
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,794
Alexander Marcus needed to respond to

1009
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:15,963
an uncivilized threat in a civilized time

1010
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:18,465
and for that he needed a Warrior's mind.

1011
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:19,717
My mind.

1012
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,136
To design weapons and warships.

1013
01:10:22,303 --> 01:10:24,221
You are suggesting the Admiral

1014
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:26,265
violated every regulation
he vowed to uphold

1015
01:10:26,348 --> 01:10:28,434
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

1016
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:30,978
He wanted to exploit my savagery.

1017
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:33,772
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1018
01:10:33,856 --> 01:10:35,608
You... You can't even break a rule.

1019
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:38,485
How would you be
expected to break bone?

1020
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,989
Marcus used me to design weapons.

1021
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:44,909
To help him realize
his vision of a militarized Starfleet.

1022
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,745
He sent you to use those weapons.

1023
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:52,207
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

1024
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:55,586
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

1025
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:59,590
in enemy space,
leading to one inevitable outcome.

1026
01:10:59,715 --> 01:11:01,300
The Klingons would come searching

1027
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:03,218
for whomever was responsible,

1028
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:05,429
and you would have
no chance of escape.

1029
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:09,975
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

1030
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:12,102
The war he always wanted.

1031
01:11:12,227 --> 01:11:13,896
No. No.

1032
01:11:14,897 --> 01:11:16,023
I watched you open fire

1033
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:18,734
in a room full of
unarmed Starfleet officers.

1034
01:11:18,943 --> 01:11:20,736
You killed them in cold blood!

1035
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:23,322
Marcus took my crew from me.

1036
01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:25,532
You are a murderer!

1037
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:29,203
He used my friends to control me.

1038
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:35,250
I tried to smuggle them to safety

1039
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:37,044
by concealing them in the very weapons

1040
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:38,837
I had designed,

1041
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:42,591
but I was discovered.

1042
01:11:43,926 --> 01:11:47,596
I had no choice but to escape alone.

1043
01:11:49,098 --> 01:11:53,268
And when I did,
I had every reason to suspect

1044
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:57,648
that Marcus had killed every single one

1045
01:11:57,731 --> 01:12:01,151
of the people I hold most dear.

1046
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,992
So I responded in kind.

1047
01:12:11,787 --> 01:12:13,122
My crew

1048
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:16,125
is my family, Kirk.

1049
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:20,337
Is there anything
you would not do for your family?

1050
01:12:22,423 --> 01:12:23,632
<i>Proximity alert, sir!</i>

1051
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:25,467
<i>There's a ship at warp
heading right for us.</i>

1052
01:12:25,551 --> 01:12:27,511
- Klingons?
- At warp?

1053
01:12:27,636 --> 01:12:28,971
No, Kirk.

1054
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:31,181
<i>- We both know who it is.
- I don't think so.</i>

1055
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:33,392
<i>It's not coming at us from Kronos.</i>

1056
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,690
Lieutenant, move Khan to med bay.

1057
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:41,134
Post six security officers on him.

1058
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,234
Yes, Captain.

1059
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:43,861
Captain on the bridge!

1060
01:12:44,737 --> 01:12:46,238
ETA of the incoming ship.

1061
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:47,614
Three seconds, sir.

1062
01:12:49,575 --> 01:12:51,577
- Shields.
- Aye, Captain.

1063
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:16,977
They're hailing us, sir.

1064
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:19,730
On screen.

1065
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:22,983
Broadcast shipwide, for the record.

1066
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:28,405
<i>Captain Kirk.</i>

1067
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:32,493
Admiral Marcus. I wasn't expecting you.

1068
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,204
That's a hell of a ship you got there.

1069
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:36,580
<i>And I wasn't expecting to get word</i>

1070
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,290
<i>that you'd taken Harrison into custody</i>

1071
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:40,042
<i>in violation of your orders.</i>

1072
01:13:40,876 --> 01:13:42,544
Well, we...

1073
01:13:42,628 --> 01:13:44,588
We had to improvise
when our warp core

1074
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,632
unexpectedly malfunctioned.

1075
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:48,675
But you already knew that,
didn't you, sir?

1076
01:13:48,842 --> 01:13:50,219
<i>I don't take your meaning.</i>

1077
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:51,905
Well, that's why you're here, isn't it?

1078
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:54,056
To assist with our repairs?

1079
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:56,391
Why else would the head of Starfleet

1080
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,393
personally come to the edge
of the Neutral Zone?

1081
01:13:59,812 --> 01:14:01,396
Captain, they're scanning our ship.

1082
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:03,690
Is there something
I can help you find, sir?

1083
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:06,235
<i>Where is your prisoner, Kirk?</i>

1084
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:07,528
Per Starfleet regulation,

1085
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:11,824
I'm planning on returning Khan
to Earth to stand trial.

1086
01:14:12,908 --> 01:14:14,576
Well, shit.

1087
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:17,079
You talked to him.

1088
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,833
This is exactly what I was
hoping to spare you from.

1089
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,752
<i>I took a tactical risk
and I woke that bastard up,</i>

1090
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:26,213
<i>believing that his superior intelligence</i>

1091
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:29,216
could help us protect ourselves
from whatever came at us next.

1092
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,386
But I made a mistake.

1093
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:36,557
<i>And now the blood
of everybody he's killed is on my hands.</i>

1094
01:14:37,141 --> 01:14:39,184
So I'm asking you,

1095
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:41,061
give him to me

1096
01:14:41,145 --> 01:14:44,231
so that I can end what I started.

1097
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:48,944
And what exactly
would you like me to do

1098
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:50,904
with the rest of his crew, sir?

1099
01:14:52,406 --> 01:14:56,034
Fire them at the Klingons?
End 72 lives?

1100
01:14:56,118 --> 01:14:57,661
Start a war in the process?

1101
01:14:57,786 --> 01:15:00,581
He put those people in those torpedoes.

1102
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:02,291
<i>And I simply didn't want to burden you</i>

1103
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:04,543
<i>with knowing what was inside of them.</i>

1104
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:06,545
<i>You saw what this man
can do all by himself.</i>

1105
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:10,424
<i>Can you imagine what would happen
if we woke up the rest of his crew?</i>

1106
01:15:11,175 --> 01:15:13,552
What else did he tell you?
That he's a peacekeeper?

1107
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,555
<i>He's playing you, son,
don't you see that?</i>

1108
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:20,267
<i>Khan and his crew were condemned
to death as war criminals.</i>

1109
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:22,769
<i>And now it is our duty
to carry out that sentence</i>

1110
01:15:22,853 --> 01:15:25,272
<i>before anybody else
dies because of him.</i>

1111
01:15:27,858 --> 01:15:30,194
Now, I'm going to ask you again!

1112
01:15:31,028 --> 01:15:33,280
One last time, son.

1113
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:36,783
<i>Lower your shields.</i>

1114
01:15:37,201 --> 01:15:38,952
<i>Tell me where he is.</i>

1115
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:43,790
He's in engineering, sir.

1116
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:46,877
But I'll have him moved

1117
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,962
to the transporter room right away.

1118
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:50,964
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

1119
01:15:51,757 --> 01:15:52,797
Do not drop those shields,

1120
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:53,839
- Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, Captain.

1121
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:54,885
Captain, given your awareness

1122
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:56,529
of Khan's true location in the med bay,

1123
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:58,222
may I know the details of your plan?

1124
01:15:58,305 --> 01:16:01,183
I told Marcus we were
bringing a fugitive back to Earth.

1125
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:02,976
That's what we're going to do.

1126
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:04,645
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?

1127
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:06,396
Sir, if we go to warp,

1128
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,608
we run the risk of
seriously damaging the core!

1129
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:11,109
<i>Can we do it?</i>

1130
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:15,614
Technically, yes, but I
would not advise it, Captain.

1131
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:17,115
Noted.

1132
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:20,035
Mr. Sulu, set course for Earth.

1133
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,161
Yes, sir.

1134
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:23,705
Punch it.

1135
01:16:30,671 --> 01:16:33,548
Well, at least we're moving again.

1136
01:16:35,342 --> 01:16:39,012
If you think you're safe
at warp, you're wrong.

1137
01:16:42,933 --> 01:16:44,518
Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet.

1138
01:16:44,601 --> 01:16:46,103
Tell them we were pursued
into the Neutral Zone

1139
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:47,813
by an unmarked Federation ship.

1140
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:48,981
Comms are down, sir.

1141
01:16:51,525 --> 01:16:52,567
Permission to come on the bridge.

1142
01:16:52,693 --> 01:16:53,694
Dr. Marcus.

1143
01:16:54,403 --> 01:16:55,737
He's gonna catch up with us,
and when he does,

1144
01:16:55,862 --> 01:16:57,197
the only thing
that's gonna stop him destroying

1145
01:16:57,281 --> 01:16:58,699
this ship is me,
so you have to let me talk to him.

1146
01:16:58,782 --> 01:17:00,662
Carol, we're at warp.
He can't catch up with us.

1147
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:01,952
Yes, he can.
He's been developing a ship

1148
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:03,328
that has advanced warp capabilities...

1149
01:17:03,412 --> 01:17:06,039
Captain! I'm getting
a reading I don't understand.

1150
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:36,987
Where are we?

1151
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,238
We're 237,000 kilometers from Earth.

1152
01:17:38,322 --> 01:17:39,323
- Damage report!
- Weapons are way down.

1153
01:17:39,406 --> 01:17:40,782
- Shields are dropping.
- We're defenseless, sir.

1154
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:42,147
Sir, we have a bulkhead breach.

1155
01:17:42,242 --> 01:17:44,244
- Where's the damage?
- Major hull damage, Captain.

1156
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,169
Evasive maneuvers! Get us to Earth!
Right now!

1157
01:17:52,252 --> 01:17:55,505
Captain! Stop!
Everybody on this ship is going to die

1158
01:17:55,589 --> 01:17:56,910
if you don't let me speak to him.

1159
01:17:59,343 --> 01:18:01,094
Uhura, hail him.

1160
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:04,097
Sir. It's me. It's Carol.

1161
01:18:13,774 --> 01:18:16,401
<i>What are you doing on that ship?</i>

1162
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:18,278
I heard what you said.

1163
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:21,114
That you made a mistake

1164
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:23,617
and now you're doing
everything you can to fix it.

1165
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:26,119
But, Dad,

1166
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:33,210
I don't believe that
the man who raised me

1167
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:37,923
is capable of destroying a ship
full of innocent people.

1168
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:40,884
<i>And, if I'm wrong about that,</i>

1169
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,387
then you're gonna have to
do it with me on board.

1170
01:18:46,473 --> 01:18:48,141
<i>Actually, Carol, I won't.</i>

1171
01:18:53,146 --> 01:18:54,564
- Jim...
- Can we intercept the transport signal?

1172
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:55,690
No, sir.

1173
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:58,985
Carol!

1174
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:01,488
<i>Captain Kirk, without authorization</i>

1175
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:03,740
<i>and in league with
the fugitive John Harrison,</i>

1176
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:05,659
<i>you went rogue in enemy territory,</i>

1177
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:06,827
<i>leaving me no choice</i>

1178
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:08,829
<i>but to hunt you down and destroy you.</i>

1179
01:19:09,162 --> 01:19:11,415
<i>- Lock phasers.</i>
- Wait, sir, wait, wait, wait!

1180
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:12,582
<i>I'll make this quick.</i>

1181
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:14,960
<i>Target all aft torpedoes
on the Enterprise bridge.</i>

1182
01:19:15,168 --> 01:19:17,504
Sir, my crew
was just following my orders.

1183
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:20,090
I take full responsibility for my actions.

1184
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:22,259
But they were mine
and they were mine alone.

1185
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,262
If I transmit Khan's location to you now,

1186
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:27,764
all that I ask is that you spare them.

1187
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:36,440
Please, sir.

1188
01:19:38,275 --> 01:19:40,444
I'll do anything you want.

1189
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:43,697
Just let them live.

1190
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:47,617
That's a hell of an apology.

1191
01:19:47,868 --> 01:19:49,953
But if it's any consolation,

1192
01:19:50,036 --> 01:19:52,038
I was never going to spare your crew.

1193
01:19:54,124 --> 01:19:55,459
<i>Fire when...</i>

1194
01:20:15,896 --> 01:20:17,063
I'm sorry.

1195
01:20:24,404 --> 01:20:25,572
Our weapons won't fire, sir!

1196
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:26,907
Our shields are down!
We're losing power!

1197
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:29,242
Someone in engineering
just manually reset our systems!

1198
01:20:29,493 --> 01:20:31,745
What do you mean, "someone"? Who?

1199
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:34,498
Their weapons have powered down. Sir.

1200
01:20:34,581 --> 01:20:36,833
Enterprise! <i>Can you hear me?</i>

1201
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:38,043
Scotty!

1202
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,130
Guess what I found behind Jupiter.

1203
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:44,132
- You're on that ship!
- I <i>snuck</i> on.

1204
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:45,675
And seeing as I've just
committed an act of treason

1205
01:20:45,759 --> 01:20:47,344
against a Starfleet
Admiral, I'd really like

1206
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:49,596
to get off this bloody ship.
Now beam me out!

1207
01:20:49,763 --> 01:20:50,847
You're a miracle worker.

1208
01:20:50,931 --> 01:20:52,766
We're a little low on power right now.

1209
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:53,892
<i>Just stand by. Stand by.</i>

1210
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:55,185
What do you mean, "low on power"?

1211
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:56,548
What happened to the <i>Enterprise?</i>

1212
01:20:57,229 --> 01:20:58,522
Call you back.

1213
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:01,441
Scotty!

1214
01:21:02,651 --> 01:21:05,111
Spock. Our ship, how is she?

1215
01:21:05,529 --> 01:21:06,947
Our options are limited, Captain.

1216
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,032
We cannot fire and we cannot flee.

1217
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:13,370
There is one option.

1218
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:15,288
Uhura, when you get Scotty back,

1219
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:17,207
- patch him through.
- Yes, sir.

1220
01:21:17,415 --> 01:21:18,583
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

1221
01:21:22,796 --> 01:21:24,631
Captain, I strongly object.

1222
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:26,550
To what? I haven't said anything yet.

1223
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:28,218
Since we cannot take
the ship from the outside,

1224
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:29,803
the only way we can take it
is from within.

1225
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:31,471
And as a large boarding party
would be detected,

1226
01:21:31,596 --> 01:21:32,639
it is optimal for you to take

1227
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:34,474
as few members
of the crew as possible.

1228
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:37,018
You will meet resistance,
requiring personnel

1229
01:21:37,143 --> 01:21:38,228
with advanced combat abilities

1230
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,146
and innate knowledge of that ship.

1231
01:21:40,397 --> 01:21:42,399
This indicates that
you plan to align with Khan,

1232
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:44,401
the very man
we were sent here to destroy.

1233
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:46,291
I'm not aligning with him, I'm using him.

1234
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,321
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

1235
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:50,407
An Arabic proverb attributed
to a prince who was

1236
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,250
betrayed and decapitated
by his own subjects.

1237
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:54,494
Still, it's a hell of a quote.

1238
01:21:54,578 --> 01:21:56,830
- I will go with you, Captain.
- No, I need you on the bridge.

1239
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:58,665
I cannot allow you to do this.

1240
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:00,500
It is my function aboard
this ship to advise you

1241
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:02,002
on making the wisest
decisions possible,

1242
01:22:02,127 --> 01:22:03,169
something I firmly believe

1243
01:22:03,295 --> 01:22:04,713
you are incapable
of doing in this moment.

1244
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:06,256
You're right!

1245
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,342
What I'm about to do,
it doesn't make any sense,

1246
01:22:09,551 --> 01:22:12,012
it's not logical. It is a gut feeling.

1247
01:22:15,432 --> 01:22:18,018
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

1248
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:21,396
I only know what I can do.

1249
01:22:22,022 --> 01:22:23,607
The Enterprise and her crew
need someone

1250
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:26,484
in that chair that knows what he's doing.

1251
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:31,448
And it's not me.

1252
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:35,702
It's you, Spock.

1253
01:22:58,516 --> 01:23:00,236
Tell me everything you know
about that ship.

1254
01:23:00,602 --> 01:23:02,354
Dreadnought class.

1255
01:23:02,437 --> 01:23:04,105
Two times the size,
three times the speed.

1256
01:23:04,189 --> 01:23:07,025
Advanced weaponry.
Modified for a minimal crew.

1257
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:10,028
Unlike most Federation vessels,
it's built solely for combat.

1258
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:13,448
I will do everything I can

1259
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:16,409
to make you answer for what you did.

1260
01:23:22,624 --> 01:23:24,250
But right now I need your help.

1261
01:23:24,376 --> 01:23:26,294
In exchange for what?

1262
01:23:27,629 --> 01:23:29,964
You said you'd do anything
for your crew.

1263
01:23:31,466 --> 01:23:34,260
- I can guarantee their safety.
- Captain.

1264
01:23:35,136 --> 01:23:38,807
You can't even guarantee
the safety of your own crew.

1265
01:23:44,813 --> 01:23:46,564
Bones, what are you doing
with that tribble?

1266
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:48,733
The tribble's dead.

1267
01:23:48,817 --> 01:23:52,278
I'm injecting Khan's platelets into
the deceased tissue of a necrotic host.

1268
01:23:53,321 --> 01:23:55,782
Khan's cells regenerate
like nothing I've ever seen,

1269
01:23:55,865 --> 01:23:57,617
and I want to know why.

1270
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:04,999
You coming with me or not?

1271
01:24:07,585 --> 01:24:09,254
You want to do what?

1272
01:24:09,421 --> 01:24:10,755
We're coming over there.
Sulu's maneuvering

1273
01:24:10,839 --> 01:24:12,674
<i>the Enterprise
into position as we speak.</i>

1274
01:24:12,757 --> 01:24:14,217
<i>To this ship? How?</i>

1275
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:16,845
There's a cargo door,
hangar 7, access port 101A.

1276
01:24:16,928 --> 01:24:19,013
You need to find
the manual override to open that airlock.

1277
01:24:19,097 --> 01:24:21,975
Are you crazy? Whoever you are.

1278
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:23,977
Just listen to him, Scotty.
It's gonna be all right.

1279
01:24:24,144 --> 01:24:25,520
It is not gonna be all right.

1280
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:27,397
You want me to open
an airlock into space,

1281
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,358
whereupon I will freeze,
die and explode!

1282
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:32,068
Lieutenant,
from our current position, is it possible

1283
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:34,112
to establish contact with New Vulcan?

1284
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:37,282
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

1285
01:24:39,033 --> 01:24:41,369
Mr. Sulu, what is
the status of the other ship?

1286
01:24:41,453 --> 01:24:43,037
Their systems are still offline.

1287
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:44,956
I'm aligning our ship now.

1288
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:20,687
Scotty, how we doing over there?

1289
01:25:21,075 --> 01:25:23,077
<i>Captain, I wish I had better news.</i>

1290
01:25:23,661 --> 01:25:25,830
<i>They've locked out access
to the ship's computer.</i>

1291
01:25:25,914 --> 01:25:27,499
<i>They'll have full weapons in</i>

1292
01:25:27,874 --> 01:25:29,042
three minutes.

1293
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,752
That means next time
I won't be able to stop them

1294
01:25:30,835 --> 01:25:32,670
destroying the Enterprise. Stand by.

1295
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,423
Commander, our trash exhaust
is aimed at

1296
01:25:35,507 --> 01:25:37,759
access port 101A of the other ship.

1297
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:39,552
Captain, the ships are aligned.

1298
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:40,678
Copy that.

1299
01:25:40,762 --> 01:25:43,890
- Scotty!
- I'm in the hangar. Give me a minute.

1300
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:50,522
I'm running. Stand by.

1301
01:26:00,365 --> 01:26:01,866
Hold on, now, Captain.

1302
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:04,869
This door is very wee.
I mean, you know, small.

1303
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:07,080
It's four square meters, tops.

1304
01:26:07,247 --> 01:26:09,165
It's gonna be like
jumping out of a moving car,

1305
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:11,167
off a bridge, into your shot glass.

1306
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:13,127
It's okay. I've done it before.

1307
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:16,130
Yeah, it was vertical.

1308
01:26:16,214 --> 01:26:19,133
We jumped onto a... it was a...

1309
01:26:19,217 --> 01:26:20,385
It doesn't matter. Scotty...

1310
01:26:20,468 --> 01:26:21,678
Did you find the manual override?

1311
01:26:21,761 --> 01:26:23,054
The manual override, Scotty.

1312
01:26:23,263 --> 01:26:24,931
Not yet, not yet.

1313
01:26:31,563 --> 01:26:33,231
Captain, before you launch,
you should be aware there is

1314
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:35,115
a considerable debris field
between our ships.

1315
01:26:35,275 --> 01:26:37,902
- Spock, not now. Scotty, you good?
- It's not easy!

1316
01:26:37,986 --> 01:26:40,738
Just give me two seconds,
all right, you mad bastard!

1317
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:51,249
Tell me this is gonna work.

1318
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:53,501
I have neither the information

1319
01:26:53,585 --> 01:26:55,420
nor the confidence to do so, Doctor.

1320
01:26:55,587 --> 01:26:56,921
<i>Okay, Captain, stand by.</i>

1321
01:26:57,255 --> 01:26:58,673
Boy, you're a real comfort.

1322
01:27:00,091 --> 01:27:02,093
Come on, come on, come on.

1323
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:03,261
Yes!

1324
01:27:03,386 --> 01:27:04,929
<i>Okay, okay! I'm set to open the door.</i>

1325
01:27:05,013 --> 01:27:06,139
You ready?

1326
01:27:06,347 --> 01:27:07,682
Are you?

1327
01:27:10,935 --> 01:27:12,270
Spock, pull the trigger.

1328
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:14,522
Yes, Captain.

1329
01:27:20,278 --> 01:27:21,946
Launching activation sequence on

1330
01:27:22,196 --> 01:27:23,489
<i>three,</i>

1331
01:27:23,656 --> 01:27:24,824
<i>two,</i>

1332
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:26,492
<i>ODE.</i>

1333
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:39,380
Sir, Kirk is headed for collision at .432!

1334
01:27:39,672 --> 01:27:41,466
Captain, there is debris directly ahead.

1335
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:42,550
Copy that.

1336
01:27:46,554 --> 01:27:47,972
Jim, you're way off course!

1337
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,379
I know, I know! I can see that.

1338
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:01,361
Don't move.

1339
01:28:03,655 --> 01:28:05,156
Use your display compass, Captain.

1340
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:06,282
You must correct precisely

1341
01:28:06,366 --> 01:28:08,451
<i>- 37.243 degrees.
- Got it.</i>

1342
01:28:08,701 --> 01:28:09,702
I'm working my way back.

1343
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:14,620
Scotty, you're gonna be ready
with that door, right?

1344
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,126
What are you doing in here?

1345
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:21,214
Wee bit of maintenance
on the airlock console. You're big.

1346
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:22,674
Mr. Scott, where are you?

1347
01:28:22,757 --> 01:28:24,157
Captain, he can't seem to hear you.

1348
01:28:24,217 --> 01:28:26,137
I'm working on getting
his signal back. Stand by.

1349
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:30,682
<i>- Damn it.
- Captain, what is it?</i>

1350
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:31,766
My helmet was hit.

1351
01:28:31,849 --> 01:28:33,434
Uhura, tell me you have Mr. Scott back.

1352
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:35,019
Not yet. I'm still working on a signal.

1353
01:28:35,186 --> 01:28:36,646
<i>His communicator is working.</i>

1354
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,932
<i>- I don't know why he isn't responding.</i>
- What <i>is that?</i>

1355
01:28:38,982 --> 01:28:40,502
Are you Starfleet or private security?

1356
01:28:40,525 --> 01:28:41,485
Show me your other hand.

1357
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:42,694
Because you look like private security.

1358
01:28:42,777 --> 01:28:44,237
Imminent collision detected!

1359
01:28:44,404 --> 01:28:45,405
Khan, use evasive action!

1360
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,573
- There is debris directly ahead.
- I see it.

1361
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:55,832
Mr. Sulu, did we lose Khan?

1362
01:28:55,915 --> 01:28:58,915
I don't know, Commander. I'm having
trouble tracking him in all this debris.

1363
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:00,420
Was Khan hit?

1364
01:29:00,545 --> 01:29:01,796
We are trying to find him now.

1365
01:29:02,088 --> 01:29:03,715
Captain, you need to adjust
your target destination

1366
01:29:03,798 --> 01:29:06,134
to 183 by 473 degrees.

1367
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:19,564
Spock, my display's dead.
I'm flying blind.

1368
01:29:20,148 --> 01:29:21,816
Captain, without your display compass,

1369
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:23,735
hitting your target destination
is mathematically impossible.

1370
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:25,236
Spock, if I get back,

1371
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:27,239
we really need to talk
about your bedside manner.

1372
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,282
Commander, he's not going to make it.

1373
01:29:34,871 --> 01:29:36,497
My display is still functioning.

1374
01:29:36,581 --> 01:29:38,249
I see you, Kirk,
you're 200 meters ahead of me

1375
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:39,542
at my one o'clock.

1376
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:41,669
Come to your left
a few degrees and follow me.

1377
01:29:54,307 --> 01:29:55,641
Scotty, we're getting close.
We need a warm welcome.

1378
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,269
Do you copy? Do you copy? Scotty?

1379
01:29:58,352 --> 01:29:59,687
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott,

1380
01:29:59,771 --> 01:30:01,564
- open the door in ten, nine...
- Scotty!

1381
01:30:01,647 --> 01:30:02,687
That person counting down,

1382
01:30:02,732 --> 01:30:03,733
<i>- what 'vs that'?
- ...eight...</i>

1383
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:04,901
I think you're hearing things, mate.

1384
01:30:05,026 --> 01:30:06,819
- seven...
- Mr. Scott, where are you?

1385
01:30:06,903 --> 01:30:09,989
- six, five...
- 1,800 meters. 1,600 meters.

1386
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:11,449
- Scotty, where are you?
- three...

1387
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:13,326
- Do you copy, Scotty? Please!
<i>- two...</i>

1388
01:30:13,493 --> 01:30:14,619
- Sorry about this.
- About what?

1389
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:15,953
- Mr. Scott, open the door!
- Open the door!

1390
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:17,663
<i>Mr. Scott, now!</i>

1391
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:40,520
Welcome aboard.

1392
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:44,440
- It's good to see you, Scotty.
- Who is that?

1393
01:30:46,901 --> 01:30:48,569
Khan, Scotty. Scotty, Khan.

1394
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:49,987
Hello.

1395
01:30:50,738 --> 01:30:52,115
They'll know we're here.

1396
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:54,158
I know the best way to the bridge.

1397
01:30:57,995 --> 01:30:59,664
It's locked to stun.

1398
01:30:59,914 --> 01:31:01,249
Theirs won't be.

1399
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:03,167
Try not to get shot.

1400
01:31:06,254 --> 01:31:09,090
Commander, I have that
transmission as requested.

1401
01:31:09,423 --> 01:31:11,092
On screen, please.

1402
01:31:11,425 --> 01:31:12,593
Stand by.

1403
01:31:18,766 --> 01:31:20,101
<i>Mr. Spock.</i>

1404
01:31:21,602 --> 01:31:22,937
Mr. Spock.

1405
01:31:27,441 --> 01:31:28,693
Admiral.

1406
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:32,780
I'll deal with you in a...

1407
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:37,785
I am ashamed to be your daughter.

1408
01:31:41,706 --> 01:31:44,375
Sir, we just had
a hangar door open on deck 13.

1409
01:31:45,793 --> 01:31:46,961
Khan.

1410
01:31:47,211 --> 01:31:49,463
They're going to have
full power and we're walking?

1411
01:31:49,547 --> 01:31:50,715
The turbolifts are easily tracked

1412
01:31:50,798 --> 01:31:52,216
and Marcus would have us in a cage.

1413
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,552
This path runs adjacent
to the engine room.

1414
01:31:54,635 --> 01:31:56,304
They know they
won't be able to use their weapons here

1415
01:31:56,387 --> 01:31:57,638
without destabilizing the warp core,

1416
01:31:57,722 --> 01:31:59,140
which gives us the advantage.

1417
01:31:59,223 --> 01:32:01,976
- Where'd you find this guy?
- It's a long story.

1418
01:32:02,226 --> 01:32:03,311
<i>I Will be brief.</i>

1419
01:32:04,312 --> 01:32:07,648
In your travels, did you ever
encounter a man named Khan?

1420
01:32:12,236 --> 01:32:13,321
<i>As you know,</i>

1421
01:32:13,404 --> 01:32:15,740
<i>I have made a vow
never to give you information</i>

1422
01:32:15,823 --> 01:32:18,743
<i>that could potentially alter your destiny.</i>

1423
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:24,332
<i>Your path is yours to walk,
and yours alone.</i>

1424
01:32:28,002 --> 01:32:30,004
<i>That being said,</i>

1425
01:32:31,172 --> 01:32:35,343
<i>Khan Noonien Singh is
the most dangerous adversary</i>

1426
01:32:35,426 --> 01:32:37,678
<i>the Enterprise ever faced.</i>

1427
01:32:38,346 --> 01:32:41,224
<i>He is brilliant, ruthless,</i>

1428
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:43,935
<i>and he will not hesitate to kill</i>

1429
01:32:44,018 --> 01:32:45,978
<i>every single one of you.</i>

1430
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:51,484
Did you defeat him?

1431
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,696
<i>At great cost. Yes.</i>

1432
01:32:57,698 --> 01:32:58,699
How?

1433
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:00,868
I don't mean to tempt fate here,
but where is everybody?

1434
01:33:00,952 --> 01:33:02,662
The ship is designed
to be flown by minimal crew,

1435
01:33:02,745 --> 01:33:03,788
one, if necessary.

1436
01:33:03,871 --> 01:33:05,122
One? I...

1437
01:33:26,394 --> 01:33:28,729
- You all right?
- Yeah. Where's Khan?

1438
01:33:34,235 --> 01:33:36,570
Lieutenant, I need you to
assemble all senior medical

1439
01:33:36,654 --> 01:33:38,255
and engineering staff
in the weapons bay.

1440
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:40,157
All right.

1441
01:33:41,659 --> 01:33:44,829
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently
activated a torpedo.

1442
01:33:44,912 --> 01:33:46,192
Could you replicate the process?

1443
01:33:46,247 --> 01:33:47,727
Why the hell would I want to do that?

1444
01:33:47,748 --> 01:33:49,166
Can you or can you not?

1445
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:52,044
Damn it, man, I'm a doctor,
not a torpedo technician!

1446
01:33:52,253 --> 01:33:53,379
The fact that you
are a doctor is precisely

1447
01:33:53,462 --> 01:33:55,089
why I need you to listen very carefully.

1448
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:57,925
Where is he?

1449
01:34:03,431 --> 01:34:04,765
Shit!

1450
01:34:05,099 --> 01:34:07,059
This way.

1451
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:11,856
The minute we get
to the bridge, drop him.

1452
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:15,401
What, stun him? Khan?
I thought he was helping us.

1453
01:34:15,568 --> 01:34:17,320
I'm pretty sure we're helping him.

1454
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:27,872
Power coming online, sir!

1455
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:30,166
- Retarget the <i>Enterprise</i> now.
- Aye, sir.

1456
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:45,848
Make sure he stays down.

1457
01:34:46,932 --> 01:34:48,267
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1458
01:34:52,063 --> 01:34:54,398
Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest.

1459
01:34:54,565 --> 01:34:56,366
You're not actually
going to do this, are you?

1460
01:34:57,902 --> 01:35:00,154
Admiral, get out of the chair.

1461
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:02,823
You better stop
and think about what you're doing, Kirk.

1462
01:35:02,948 --> 01:35:04,992
You better think about
what you did on Kronos.

1463
01:35:05,201 --> 01:35:07,703
You made an incursion
onto an enemy planet!

1464
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:09,955
You killed a Klingon patrol.

1465
01:35:10,164 --> 01:35:13,334
Even if you got away without
a trace, war is coming.

1466
01:35:13,584 --> 01:35:16,921
And who is going to lead us? You?

1467
01:35:17,254 --> 01:35:18,798
If I'm not in charge,

1468
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:21,592
our entire way of life is decimated!

1469
01:35:22,259 --> 01:35:24,762
So you want me off this ship,

1470
01:35:25,096 --> 01:35:27,431
you better kill me.

1471
01:35:27,598 --> 01:35:29,350
I'm not going to kill you, sir.

1472
01:35:30,518 --> 01:35:34,188
But I could stun your ass
and drag you out of that chair.

1473
01:35:34,438 --> 01:35:37,108
I'd rather not do that
in front of your daughter.

1474
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:42,863
- You all right?
- Yes, Captain.

1475
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,450
Jim!

1476
01:35:59,713 --> 01:36:01,465
Listen! Wait!

1477
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:14,186
You...

1478
01:36:14,687 --> 01:36:18,107
You should have let me sleep.

1479
01:36:23,404 --> 01:36:24,644
Where is the Captain, Mr. Sulu?

1480
01:36:24,738 --> 01:36:27,074
Our sensor array's down, sir.
I can't find him.

1481
01:36:28,826 --> 01:36:30,870
<i>I'm going to make this
very simple for you.</i>

1482
01:36:30,995 --> 01:36:33,581
<i>- Captain.
- Your crew for my crew.</i>

1483
01:36:33,747 --> 01:36:34,915
You betrayed us.

1484
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:37,168
<i>You are smart, Mr. Spock.</i>

1485
01:36:37,251 --> 01:36:38,669
<i>Spock don't...</i>

1486
01:36:41,088 --> 01:36:44,258
<i>Mr. Spock, give me my crew.</i>

1487
01:36:45,092 --> 01:36:46,677
And what will you do
when you get them?

1488
01:36:46,802 --> 01:36:49,263
<i>Continue the work we were doing
before we were banished.</i>

1489
01:36:49,388 --> 01:36:51,140
Which, as I understand it,
involves the mass genocide

1490
01:36:51,223 --> 01:36:54,268
of any being you find to be
less than superior.

1491
01:36:54,435 --> 01:36:56,437
<i>Shall I destroy you, Mr. Spock?</i>

1492
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:59,440
<i>Or will you give me what I want?</i>

1493
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:03,861
We have no transporter capabilities.

1494
01:37:03,986 --> 01:37:05,905
<i>Fortunately mine are
perfectly functional.</i>

1495
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:08,199
<i>Drop your shields.</i>

1496
01:37:08,616 --> 01:37:10,242
If I do so, I have no guarantee

1497
01:37:10,326 --> 01:37:12,036
that you will not destroy the Enterprise.

1498
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:14,622
Well, let's play this out
logically then, Mr. Spock.

1499
01:37:14,705 --> 01:37:16,373
Firstly, I will kill your Captain

1500
01:37:16,457 --> 01:37:18,083
to demonstrate my resolve.

1501
01:37:18,167 --> 01:37:21,045
Then if yours holds,
I will have no choice

1502
01:37:21,128 --> 01:37:23,672
but to kill you and your entire crew.

1503
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:25,508
If you destroy our ship,

1504
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:27,593
you will also destroy your own people.

1505
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:30,554
Your crew requires oxygen
to survive, mine does not.

1506
01:37:30,638 --> 01:37:32,264
I will target your life support systems

1507
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:34,558
located behind the aft nacelle.

1508
01:37:34,767 --> 01:37:37,937
And after every single person
aboard your ship suffocates,

1509
01:37:38,103 --> 01:37:42,608
I will walk over your cold
corpses to recover my people.

1510
01:37:45,152 --> 01:37:46,570
Now,

1511
01:37:47,321 --> 01:37:49,323
shall we begin?

1512
01:37:53,327 --> 01:37:54,662
Lower shields.

1513
01:37:58,582 --> 01:38:00,543
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.

1514
01:38:08,509 --> 01:38:11,262
I see your 72 torpedoes
are still in their tubes.

1515
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,973
If they are not mine,
Commander, I will know it.

1516
01:38:14,265 --> 01:38:16,433
Vulcans do not lie.

1517
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:19,478
The torpedoes are yours.

1518
01:38:30,322 --> 01:38:31,991
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

1519
01:38:32,324 --> 01:38:34,493
I have fulfilled your terms.

1520
01:38:34,994 --> 01:38:36,203
Now fulfill mine.

1521
01:38:37,413 --> 01:38:39,331
Well, Kirk,

1522
01:38:39,582 --> 01:38:41,750
it seems apt to return you to your crew.

1523
01:38:42,543 --> 01:38:44,169
After all,

1524
01:38:47,006 --> 01:38:50,301
no ship should go down
without her captain.

1525
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:54,346
He's locking phasers on us, sir!

1526
01:39:00,603 --> 01:39:01,687
Let us out of here now!

1527
01:39:10,946 --> 01:39:12,531
Shields at 6%!

1528
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:14,742
The torpedoes!
How much time, Lieutenant?

1529
01:39:14,867 --> 01:39:15,868
Twelve seconds, sir!

1530
01:39:15,993 --> 01:39:17,036
Crew of the <i>Enterprise,</i>

1531
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,759
prepare for imminent
proximity detonation.

1532
01:39:19,038 --> 01:39:20,873
What's he talking about?
What detonation?

1533
01:39:20,956 --> 01:39:23,042
The torpedoes.
He armed the damn torpedoes!

1534
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:34,261
No!

1535
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,161
Sir, their weapons
have been knocked out.

1536
01:39:44,229 --> 01:39:46,315
- Not bad, Commander.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

1537
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:48,567
- Bones!
- Bones!

1538
01:39:48,651 --> 01:39:50,778
- Nurse!
- I got you. I got you.

1539
01:39:50,861 --> 01:39:52,988
Dr. Marcus.

1540
01:39:54,573 --> 01:39:55,658
Good to see you, Jim.

1541
01:39:55,741 --> 01:39:57,381
You helped Spock
detonate those torpedoes?

1542
01:39:57,409 --> 01:39:58,410
Damn right I did.

1543
01:39:58,494 --> 01:39:59,995
He killed Khan's crew!

1544
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:01,664
Spock's cold, but he's not that cold.

1545
01:40:02,081 --> 01:40:04,083
I've got Khan's crew.

1546
01:40:04,249 --> 01:40:06,418
Seventy-two human popsicles

1547
01:40:06,585 --> 01:40:09,088
safe and sound in their cryo tubes.

1548
01:40:09,922 --> 01:40:11,048
Son of a bitch!

1549
01:40:16,804 --> 01:40:18,597
Sir, the central power grid is failing!

1550
01:40:18,764 --> 01:40:21,934
- Switch to auxiliary power.
- Auxiliary power failing, sir.

1551
01:40:29,608 --> 01:40:31,488
Commander, our ship's
caught in Earth's gravity!

1552
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:33,946
- Can we stop?
- I can't do anything.

1553
01:40:43,205 --> 01:40:44,957
Sorry! Oh, no.

1554
01:40:45,207 --> 01:40:46,333
Clear the area!

1555
01:40:47,042 --> 01:40:49,962
Engage emergency lockdown!
I hope you don't get seasick.

1556
01:40:50,129 --> 01:40:52,005
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1557
01:40:52,214 --> 01:40:53,815
Lieutenant, sound evacuation, all decks.

1558
01:40:53,841 --> 01:40:54,842
Aye, sir.

1559
01:40:56,009 --> 01:40:59,680
As acting Captain,
I order you to abandon this ship.

1560
01:41:00,973 --> 01:41:02,891
I will remain behind and divert all power

1561
01:41:03,058 --> 01:41:04,435
to life support
and evacuation shuttle bays.

1562
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,186
<i>Evacuation protocols...</i>

1563
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:08,814
I order you to abandon the ship!

1564
01:41:08,939 --> 01:41:12,025
All due respect, Commander,
but we're not going anywhere.

1565
01:41:16,071 --> 01:41:19,158
One day I've been off this ship!
One bloody day!

1566
01:41:23,203 --> 01:41:25,456
Gravity systems are failing.
Hold on! Hold on!

1567
01:41:29,126 --> 01:41:30,794
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1568
01:41:30,878 --> 01:41:32,379
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1569
01:41:33,505 --> 01:41:36,300
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1570
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:37,869
There won't be time for evacuation

1571
01:41:37,885 --> 01:41:41,054
if we don't get power
to stabilize the damn ship!

1572
01:41:41,221 --> 01:41:43,724
- Can we restore it?
- Only from engineering.

1573
01:41:43,849 --> 01:41:46,351
We have to get back to the warp core.

1574
01:41:49,229 --> 01:41:50,564
Jim?

1575
01:41:51,523 --> 01:41:53,859
Scotty, we got to get
the power back on! Come on!

1576
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,045
- Scotty, we got to jump!
- What?

1577
01:42:13,295 --> 01:42:14,546
Jump! Jump!

1578
01:42:14,671 --> 01:42:16,340
Oh, God.

1579
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:19,551
Emergency power at 15% and dropping.

1580
01:42:19,676 --> 01:42:21,053
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1581
01:42:21,136 --> 01:42:23,597
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1582
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:27,184
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1583
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:41,240
- Jim?
- Hold on!

1584
01:42:41,448 --> 01:42:42,783
I can't.

1585
01:43:01,343 --> 01:43:02,845
I've got you, Captain!

1586
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:04,680
- Chekov.
- Don't let go!

1587
01:43:15,774 --> 01:43:18,527
Even if we get the warp core online,
we've still got to redirect the power!

1588
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:20,195
- He's right, Captain!
- What are you talking about?

1589
01:43:20,279 --> 01:43:22,364
Someone has to hit
the manual override.

1590
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:23,699
Laddie, there's a switch...

1591
01:43:23,782 --> 01:43:26,034
Behind the deflector dish!
I'll flip the switch!

1592
01:43:26,118 --> 01:43:27,536
Let's go!

1593
01:43:30,497 --> 01:43:31,498
Oh, no.

1594
01:43:42,843 --> 01:43:45,596
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1595
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:48,390
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1596
01:43:50,267 --> 01:43:52,144
Mr. Sulu, divert
any remaining power to stabilizers.

1597
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:54,062
Doing what I can, sir. Doing what I can.

1598
01:44:10,454 --> 01:44:13,457
<i>Core misaligned. Danger.</i>

1599
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:15,208
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- What?

1600
01:44:15,292 --> 01:44:16,543
The housings are misaligned!

1601
01:44:16,627 --> 01:44:18,545
There's no way
we can redirect the power!

1602
01:44:18,629 --> 01:44:21,632
The ship's dead, sir. She's gone.

1603
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:24,968
- No, she's not.
- Wait, Jim!

1604
01:44:25,093 --> 01:44:27,596
If we go in there, we'll die!

1605
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,681
Do you hear me?
The radiation will kill us!

1606
01:44:29,973 --> 01:44:32,225
Will you listen to me?
What the hell are you doing?

1607
01:44:32,309 --> 01:44:33,477
I'm opening the door. I'm going in.

1608
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,771
That door is there to stop us
from getting irradiated!

1609
01:44:35,854 --> 01:44:38,148
We'd be dead
before we made the climb!

1610
01:44:40,567 --> 01:44:41,860
You're not making the climb.

1611
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:45,781
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1612
01:44:45,864 --> 01:44:48,659
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1613
01:45:47,801 --> 01:45:49,761
If we don't get power
or shields back online,

1614
01:45:49,845 --> 01:45:52,472
we're gonna be incinerated on re-entry!

1615
01:46:59,206 --> 01:47:00,290
Warp core is back online!

1616
01:47:00,499 --> 01:47:02,000
Maximum thrusters, Mr. Sulu!

1617
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:09,382
Thrusters at maximum!
Stand by! Stand by!

1618
01:47:36,868 --> 01:47:39,037
- Shields restored!
- Commander, power online.

1619
01:47:39,329 --> 01:47:41,331
Mr. Spock, altitude stabilizing.

1620
01:47:41,665 --> 01:47:43,500
It's a miracle.

1621
01:47:45,252 --> 01:47:47,254
There are no such things.

1622
01:47:49,673 --> 01:47:51,091
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

1623
01:47:51,174 --> 01:47:52,425
<i>- Mr. Spock!</i>
- Mr. Scott.

1624
01:47:52,509 --> 01:47:55,428
<i>Sir, you'd better get down here.</i>

1625
01:47:55,512 --> 01:47:56,847
<i>Better hurry.</i>

1626
01:48:19,536 --> 01:48:20,620
Open it.

1627
01:48:20,745 --> 01:48:22,497
The decontamination process
is not complete.

1628
01:48:22,622 --> 01:48:23,748
You'd flood the whole compartment.

1629
01:48:23,874 --> 01:48:25,917
The door's locked, sir.

1630
01:48:55,405 --> 01:48:56,448
How's our ship?

1631
01:48:58,241 --> 01:48:59,743
Out of danger.

1632
01:49:02,245 --> 01:49:04,456
You saved the crew.

1633
01:49:05,916 --> 01:49:08,752
You used what he wanted against him.

1634
01:49:12,756 --> 01:49:14,549
That's a nice move.

1635
01:49:16,259 --> 01:49:18,261
It is what you would have done.

1636
01:49:20,013 --> 01:49:21,264
And this,

1637
01:49:22,933 --> 01:49:24,935
this is what you would have done.

1638
01:49:25,268 --> 01:49:27,437
It was only logical.

1639
01:49:33,777 --> 01:49:35,487
I'm scared, Spock.

1640
01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:40,951
Help me not be.

1641
01:49:45,372 --> 01:49:47,707
How do you choose not to feel?

1642
01:49:54,464 --> 01:49:56,132
I do not know.

1643
01:49:58,802 --> 01:50:00,845
Right now I am failing.

1644
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:10,647
I want you to know
why I couldn't let you die.

1645
01:50:14,818 --> 01:50:16,569
Why I went back for you.

1646
01:50:18,488 --> 01:50:20,907
Because you are my friend.

1647
01:51:44,282 --> 01:51:47,327
Khan!

1648
01:51:49,913 --> 01:51:51,247
God, that was close!

1649
01:51:54,584 --> 01:51:58,797
Set destination, Starfleet Headquarters!

1650
01:51:58,963 --> 01:52:00,215
<i>Engines compromised.</i>

1651
01:52:00,298 --> 01:52:02,342
<i>Cannot guarantee destination.</i>

1652
01:52:02,425 --> 01:52:03,802
<i>Confirm order.</i>

1653
01:52:04,177 --> 01:52:05,428
Confirm.

1654
01:53:09,826 --> 01:53:12,036
Search the enemy ship for signs of life.

1655
01:53:12,328 --> 01:53:14,205
Sir, there's no way anyone survived.

1656
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:16,666
He could.

1657
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:18,501
Yes, sir.

1658
01:53:50,241 --> 01:53:51,868
He just jumped 30 meters!

1659
01:53:52,035 --> 01:53:53,161
Can we beam him up?

1660
01:53:53,244 --> 01:53:54,287
There's too much damage.

1661
01:53:54,412 --> 01:53:55,747
I have no incoming signal.

1662
01:53:55,914 --> 01:53:58,750
But it may be possible
to beam you down, sir.

1663
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:00,502
Go get him.

1664
01:54:05,632 --> 01:54:08,218
- Stand by for coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

1665
01:54:08,551 --> 01:54:11,054
Enter 3517 by 2598.

1666
01:54:11,179 --> 01:54:12,972
Coordinates confirmed.

1667
01:55:51,112 --> 01:55:52,947
Get me a cryo tube, now!

1668
01:56:48,753 --> 01:56:50,296
Get this guy out of the cryo tube.

1669
01:56:50,421 --> 01:56:51,714
Keep him in an induced coma.

1670
01:56:51,798 --> 01:56:53,257
We're gonna put Kirk inside.

1671
01:56:53,341 --> 01:56:55,051
It's our only chance to
preserve his brain function.

1672
01:56:55,134 --> 01:56:56,969
How much of Khan's blood is left?

1673
01:56:57,095 --> 01:56:58,096
None.

1674
01:56:58,971 --> 01:57:02,016
<i>Enterprise</i> to Spock. Spock!

1675
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:05,079
Activate the cryogenic sequence.

1676
01:58:07,081 --> 01:58:08,541
McCoy to bridge.

1677
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:11,586
I can't reach Spock. I need Khan alive.

1678
01:58:11,669 --> 01:58:14,839
You get that son of a bitch
back on board right now!

1679
01:58:15,757 --> 01:58:17,341
I think he can save Kirk.

1680
01:58:17,467 --> 01:58:18,747
Can we beam them up to the ship?

1681
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:21,179
They keep moving! I can't
get a lock on either of them.

1682
01:58:21,262 --> 01:58:22,597
Can you beam someone down?

1683
01:58:57,548 --> 01:58:58,549
Spock!

1684
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,141
Spock!

1685
01:59:07,391 --> 01:59:09,227
Spock, stop! Stop!

1686
01:59:09,852 --> 01:59:12,063
He's our only chance to save Kirk!

1687
01:59:21,781 --> 01:59:24,116
<i>- What is it?
- It's a boy.</i>

1688
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:25,451
<i>Let's call him Jim.</i>

1689
01:59:25,576 --> 01:59:27,870
<i>Your father was
captain of a starship for 12 minutes.</i>

1690
01:59:27,954 --> 01:59:31,874
<i>He saved 800 lives.
I dare you to do better.</i>

1691
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:44,053
Don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.

1692
01:59:44,136 --> 01:59:46,722
It was the transfusion
that really took its toll.

1693
01:59:46,931 --> 01:59:47,890
You were out cold for two weeks.

1694
01:59:47,974 --> 01:59:48,975
Transfusion?

1695
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:51,811
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1696
01:59:52,603 --> 01:59:53,813
Khan?

1697
01:59:53,938 --> 01:59:55,106
Once we caught him,

1698
01:59:55,231 --> 01:59:57,859
I synthesized a serum
from his superblood.

1699
01:59:57,942 --> 02:00:00,486
Tell me, are you feeling homicidal?

1700
02:00:00,611 --> 02:00:02,113
Power mad? Despotic?

1701
02:00:02,321 --> 02:00:03,990
No more than usual.

1702
02:00:04,448 --> 02:00:05,616
How'd you catch him?

1703
02:00:05,992 --> 02:00:07,326
I didn't.

1704
02:00:16,168 --> 02:00:17,795
You saved my life.

1705
02:00:17,962 --> 02:00:20,464
Uhura and I had
something to do with it, too, you know.

1706
02:00:22,049 --> 02:00:24,302
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...

1707
02:00:24,802 --> 02:00:26,137
Spock, just...

1708
02:00:27,805 --> 02:00:29,140
Thank you.

1709
02:00:30,474 --> 02:00:32,643
You are welcome, Jim.

1710
02:00:43,487 --> 02:00:46,866
<i>There will always be
those who mean to do us harm.</i>

1711
02:00:48,826 --> 02:00:50,202
<i>To stop them,</i>

1712
02:00:50,828 --> 02:00:54,707
<i>we risk awakening
the same evil within ourselves.</i>

1713
02:01:00,713 --> 02:01:03,299
<i>Our first instinct is to seek revenge</i>

1714
02:01:03,382 --> 02:01:05,718
<i>when those we love are taken from us.</i>

1715
02:01:08,804 --> 02:01:10,556
<i>But that's not who we are.</i>

1716
02:01:12,099 --> 02:01:13,726
<i>We are here today</i>

1717
02:01:13,851 --> 02:01:16,729
<i>to rechristen the U.S.S. Enterprise,</i>

1718
02:01:16,854 --> 02:01:19,690
<i>and to honor those who lost their lives</i>

1719
02:01:20,691 --> 02:01:22,360
<i>nearly one year ago.</i>

1720
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:24,987
<i>When Christopher Pike
first gave me his ship</i>

1721
02:01:25,071 --> 02:01:27,531
<i>he had me recite the Captain's Oath,</i>

1722
02:01:28,407 --> 02:01:31,243
<i>words I didn't appreciate at the time.</i>

1723
02:01:31,911 --> 02:01:34,956
<i>Now I see them as a call
for us to remember</i>

1724
02:01:35,790 --> 02:01:37,625
<i>who we once were,</i>

1725
02:01:39,543 --> 02:01:41,921
<i>and who we must be again.</i>

1726
02:01:43,214 --> 02:01:44,715
<i>And those words?</i>

1727
02:01:45,383 --> 02:01:48,427
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1728
02:01:48,886 --> 02:01:52,598
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

1729
02:01:53,432 --> 02:01:55,309
<i>Her five-year mission,</i>

1730
02:01:55,393 --> 02:01:57,269
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

1731
02:01:57,937 --> 02:02:01,440
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

1732
02:02:02,108 --> 02:02:05,903
<i>to boldly go
where no one has gone before.</i>

1733
02:02:08,906 --> 02:02:10,783
Captain on the bridge.

1734
02:02:13,911 --> 02:02:16,247
It's hard to get out of it
once you've had a taste,

1735
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:17,832
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1736
02:02:17,915 --> 02:02:20,209
"Captain" does have a nice ring to it.

1737
02:02:20,292 --> 02:02:21,752
Chair's all yours, sir.

1738
02:02:23,587 --> 02:02:25,089
Mr. Scott.

1739
02:02:25,256 --> 02:02:26,215
<i>How's our core?</i>

1740
02:02:26,298 --> 02:02:27,925
Purring like a kitten, Captain.

1741
02:02:28,009 --> 02:02:30,302
She's ready for a long journey.

1742
02:02:30,386 --> 02:02:31,554
<i>Excellent.</i>

1743
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:34,181
Come on, Bones! It's gonna be fun.

1744
02:02:35,433 --> 02:02:38,686
Five years in space. God help me.

1745
02:02:38,936 --> 02:02:40,354
Dr. Marcus.

1746
02:02:41,772 --> 02:02:43,607
I'm glad you could be
a part of the family.

1747
02:02:44,066 --> 02:02:45,860
It's nice to have a family.

1748
02:02:48,154 --> 02:02:49,363
Spock.

1749
02:02:49,488 --> 02:02:50,656
Captain.

1750
02:02:53,617 --> 02:02:55,119
Where shall we go?

1751
02:02:56,454 --> 02:02:59,623
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted,

1752
02:03:01,625 --> 02:03:04,128
I defer to your good judgment, Captain.

1753
02:03:13,137 --> 02:03:15,681
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1754
02:03:15,806 --> 02:03:17,308
Aye, Captain.
