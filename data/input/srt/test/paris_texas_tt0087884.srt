1
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,526
What the hell?

2
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:18,574
Hey.

3
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:27,074
You know which side of the border
you are on?

4
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,491
You got a name for it?

5
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:36,998
Guess... someone must
have cut your tongue off.

6
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:40,876
Either that, or...

7
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,547
Or has something

8
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,258
To hide.

9
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:53,596
As far as I can tell...

10
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,932
You hear me plain enough.

11
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,610
Walter Henderson.

12
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,365
Now I want to ask you one last question.

13
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,242
You see this here card?

14
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,786
Is this you?

15
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:26,582
Or a relative of yours?

16
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:32,880
Well, I'm going to call up this number.

17
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:36,465
And see if they can tell me who you are.

18
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:40,428
I ain't got beds enough to be putting up mutes.

19
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:52,606
Operator. I need a line out please.

20
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:09,663
What?

21
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:14,416
What, can you... can you tell me
the exact location of your hospital down there?

22
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:18,337
Where the hell is that?

23
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,590
Oh, OK, alright.

24
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:25,759
Yeah, OK, I'll be there as fast as I can.

25
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,720
Just, will you tell him that I'm coming, OK?

26
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,013
OK.

27
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:38,394
Steven, I think you will have to change that...

28
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:41,105
- This section right here?
- Yeah, because it's incomplete.

29
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:42,774
Ann, honey?

30
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,653
I just got the strangest phone call.

31
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:48,071
Who from?

32
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:52,032
From some hospital in south Texas.
A place called Terlingua.

33
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,493
They say they found Travis.

34
00:07:55,993 --> 00:07:57,119
Oh, no.

35
00:07:58,538 --> 00:07:59,664
What are you going to do?

36
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,872
Well, I'll go down and get him.

37
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:03,290
Oh, wow.

38
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:06,043
Well, what am I going to do?
I can't leave him down there.

39
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:10,924
What about Hunter?

40
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:13,551
What am I supposed to tell him?

41
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,719
Well, just tell him
I had to go on a business trip.

42
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:18,805
I mean about Travis.

43
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:29,648
I guess you better tell him the truth.

44
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,043
Ten to Vanhorn 90...

45
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:57,088
The Alpine 118 south.

46
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:00,800
Terlingua.

47
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:34,286
You must be the brother of the mute.

48
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,498
- Mute?
- Yeah.

49
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:42,252
I couldn't squeeze the time of day out of him.

50
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,255
Must be in a kind of jam.

51
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:50,551
I don't know, I haven't seen him
in over 4 years.

52
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:52,762
Is that right?

53
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:58,265
Well, a lot can happen
to a man in 4 years.

54
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,851
All kinds of trouble.

55
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,145
Bits of trouble.

56
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:04,647
What do you mean?

57
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,189
Well, down here,

58
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,234
A man gets himself into a fix sometimes.

59
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:13,195
It costs him a little to get him out.

60
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,155
If you understand what I mean.

61
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:18,660
I don't understand you.

62
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,746
I wish you get to the point,
because I'd like to see my brother.

63
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,123
Alright son.

64
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,377
But first I would like to ask you something.

65
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:33,507
Did your brother ever get himself
into a car wreck?

66
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:39,636
Car wreck, no...

67
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,513
Not that I know of.

68
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:45,431
Then he must be mixing
with some hard company.

69
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:49,852
I'd like to see my brother now.
If you don't mind...

70
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:52,396
He disappeared.

71
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,482
You mean he's not here?

72
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:56,901
After I came all this way?

73
00:10:57,777 --> 00:11:00,154
He's been gone since early this morning.

74
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:05,074
We have his possessions.
Never the less...

75
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:06,868
Saved them.

76
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:11,080
We'd be glad to turn him over to you.

77
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:15,749
Soon, as you take care of our little reward.

78
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:54,627
Travis, hey!

79
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,675
Don't you recognize me? It's Walt!

80
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,433
It's your brother, Walt.

81
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,034
What the hell happened to you, anyway?

82
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:33,786
You look like 40 miles of rough road.

83
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,631
Come on, let's get in the car. Trav?

84
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:49,009
Come on...

85
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,891
Here Trav, here's your stuff.

86
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,811
Got that back at that clinic back there.

87
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:52,563
Sure picked a hell of a spot to land in.

88
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:55,108
I don't blame you for running out of it.

89
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:02,988
Look, Trav...

90
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:05,783
We've got quite a bit of traveling to do here,

91
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:08,160
You're not going to clam up
the whole way, are you?

92
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:10,912
I'm going to get kinda lonely.

93
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,668
Trav?

94
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:22,465
Would you mind telling me
where you disappeared to for the last 4 years?

95
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,470
Have you seen Jane, or talked to her?

96
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,308
Ann and I are...

97
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,019
We sort of gave up on you. We actually...

98
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:40,979
We thought you were dead, boy.

99
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:18,595
This is pretty a...

100
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:31,148
You OK?

101
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:40,991
Well...

102
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,163
Well, gee Trav, maybe you want to...

103
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:51,166
Clean up. Take a shower or something?

104
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,796
I think I'll go back into town
and get you some new cloths.

105
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:56,629
You could use a new set of cloths, couldn’t you?

106
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,300
What size shoes do you wear?

107
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,177
Lets see...

108
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:10,682
I'm probably one size bigger, huh?

109
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:14,895
So, where did you find that beard?

110
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:17,397
It's pretty snazzy.

111
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,778
OK, I'll zip into town and zip right back.

112
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:27,615
I won't be gone long.

113
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:36,872
You'll be OK, won't you, Trav?

114
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,961
OK, I'll be right back.

115
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:35,433
Damn it.

116
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,486
You mind telling me
where you are headed, Trav?

117
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,200
What's out there?

118
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,791
There's nothing out there.

119
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,879
Don't you trust me or something?

120
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,718
I'm just trying to help you Trav, that's all.

121
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:09,432
Come on, it's alright.

122
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,601
Come on with me in the car.

123
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:21,202
Feels good to be in new cloths, huh?

124
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:47,891
Hi, Hunter? It's Daddy.

125
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:51,018
I thought you'd be in bed already.

126
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:56,066
Guess who I'm visiting, here in Texas.

127
00:22:58,777 --> 00:22:59,737
Your father.

128
00:23:00,738 --> 00:23:02,156
Do you remember your father?

129
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:05,742
Not at all?

130
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,162
He was?

131
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:13,415
Well, guess what?

132
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,042
I'm going to bring him home to visit.

133
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,306
Travis

134
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:39,812
Do you remember your little boy?
Hunter?

135
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:44,399
Well, he's with us.

136
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,569
He's been living with Ann and me
ever since you disappeared.

137
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:52,114
We didn't know what else to do.

138
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:54,033
So, we just kept him.

139
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:58,870
One day, he was just standing at the door.

140
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:03,667
All he could tell us was that
someone brought him there in a car.

141
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,586
He didn't know what had happened to you,

142
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:08,420
Or Jane.

143
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:12,216
So we tried everything we could
think of to find you, or Jane.

144
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,219
Tried to locate her, she vanished too.

145
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:19,014
We didn't know what else to do.

146
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:25,769
Travis,

147
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,730
I don't know what kind of trouble
you got into.

148
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:31,566
I don't know what happened.

149
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:36,112
But damn it, I'm your brother man.

150
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,281
You can talk to me.

151
00:24:42,617 --> 00:24:45,661
I'm tired of doing all the taking.

152
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,158
Fill it with unleaded please.

153
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:35,954
You know, I'm getting a little sick
with this silence routine.

154
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:38,207
You can talk.

155
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:49,883
I can be silent too you know.

156
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,430
I just assumed that if we kept
our mouths shut for the rest of the trip

157
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,307
- Paris.
- What?

158
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,392
Paris.

159
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,358
Paris?

160
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,568
Paris?

161
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,072
Did you ever go to Paris?

162
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,324
No.

163
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,993
Could we go there now?

164
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,373
It's a little out of the way.

165
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:30,627
Ah, I've never even been to Europe.

166
00:26:31,002 --> 00:26:32,420
Ann keeps on wanting to go there.

167
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:35,507
Cus, she is from France, you remember?

168
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:37,757
But we never seem to find the time,

169
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:40,634
Because my company kinda keeps me busy.

170
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,191
Lets go Trav.

171
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:01,654
What's the matter?

172
00:27:02,363 --> 00:27:03,447
Where are we going?

173
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:05,155
We're going to fly to L.A.

174
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,574
You're not afraid of flying, are you?

175
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:11,036
- Leaving the ground?
- Yeah.

176
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:13,330
Why?

177
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:15,456
Because it's too far to drive.

178
00:27:15,957 --> 00:27:18,126
It would take an extra 2 days,
I can't afford the time, Trav.

179
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:19,627
Why?

180
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:25,050
It's just easier to fly, Trav.
It's faster. Come on.

181
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:45,984
It's all OK.

182
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:49,405
When I get you home, I'll get you settled
and then you can do whatever you want.

183
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:54,117
But sir, we can't stop the plane
whenever someone gets terrified.

184
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:57,077
Don't get on a plane and then
refuse to leave the ground.

185
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:00,205
Don't do things like that,
this isn't the wilderness.

186
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:02,624
You're living with people now.

187
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:06,920
You should have acquired a private plane,
do you know how many people you are detaining?

188
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:08,379
Sorry!

189
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:11,174
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! OK?

190
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:16,552
This is getting a little ridiculous Travis.

191
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:19,722
Are you going to leave me?

192
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:22,640
No, I'm not going to leave you.

193
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:25,935
It's alright if you leave me.

194
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:30,606
I don't know honey, no...
He just panicked or something.

195
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:35,026
Well, it won't do any good to try
another plane, it wasn't the plane,

196
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:36,736
he'll just get off again.

197
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,782
Well, we're just going to
have to drive it, that's all.

198
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:43,076
Yeah, it'll take a good 2 days.

199
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:50,373
I don't understand why you have to
have the exact same car you had before.

200
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:52,041
They are all alike.

201
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,126
All the cars we have here are Birds,

202
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:56,421
Olds, Chevy’s, and whatever.

203
00:28:56,755 --> 00:28:59,381
- I'm not even sure I can locate the same car...
- I know...

204
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:04,135
My brother left something in the car,
we are hoping we can search the car and find it.

205
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:07,597
Oh, well, I'll just contact the lost
and found department for you, if that's OK sir.

206
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:09,682
No, we have to have the very same car.

207
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:13,059
Well, I can't do that.
There is no way I can trace the car for you.

208
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:16,020
Well, why not?
You have the license number
right on your form there.

209
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:18,606
- Well, yes but...
- Well, just give us the license number
and we'll find it.

210
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,234
But I can't allow you on the lot sir.

211
00:29:22,485 --> 00:29:23,861
Why not? We're already on it!

212
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,780
I just have to ask you
to come back to the office with me.

213
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:32,327
- Travis!
- What?

214
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:35,706
I don't think we're going to get the very same car.

215
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:39,165
But I can rent you a model
just like the one you had before, sir.

216
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,336
I need the same car Walt.
How are we going to go in another car?

217
00:29:45,171 --> 00:29:47,088
Give us the number, will you, please?

218
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:49,965
Come on... pretty please?

219
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:55,554
Alright, that number is 667DJP

220
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,056
You remember that? 667DJP?

221
00:29:58,557 --> 00:30:00,685
- It's got a bump on the hood.
- Yes it does...

222
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,489
What's that?

223
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:18,782
What?

224
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:20,451
That, what you got in your hand?

225
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:23,162
A picture.

226
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:24,954
A picture of what?

227
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:27,123
A picture of...

228
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:30,667
Paris.

229
00:30:31,835 --> 00:30:33,212
Paris, really?

230
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:35,923
Yes, picture of a piece of Paris.

231
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:38,217
Where did you get a picture of Paris?

232
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,303
- Can I see it?
- Yes.

233
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:44,555
This is it?
This is Paris?

234
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,309
Looks just like Texas to me.

235
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:48,852
It is.

236
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:50,937
Paris, Texas?

237
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:52,981
It's right here on the map.

238
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,606
There's really a place called Paris, Texas?

239
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:56,274
It's right here.

240
00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:01,946
Well, how come you got a picture
of a vacant lot in Paris, Texas?

241
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:04,073
It's mine.

242
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:07,242
I know that, but how come you got it?

243
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:11,705
I purchased it in the mail...

244
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:13,666
A long time ago.

245
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,002
You bought a picture
of vacant lot in the mail?

246
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,379
No, I bought the land...

247
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,004
- Oh, you bought that lot.
- Yes.

248
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,381
Oh, let me see again.

249
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,718
There's nothing on it.

250
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,262
Empty.

251
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:35,182
Well, why in hell would you want to buy
a vacant lot in Paris, Texas for Christ's sake?

252
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:46,859
I forgot.

253
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:50,113
Here Trav.

254
00:31:57,953 --> 00:32:00,871
Do you remember
what mama's very first name was?

255
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:02,873
Marry.

256
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:08,004
No, I know, I mean, her...
before she found daddy.

257
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:10,212
- Oh, her median name?
- Yeah.

258
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:13,091
You don't remember her median name?

259
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,676
No...

260
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:16,970
Sekinae.

261
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:19,638
Sekinae.

262
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,098
Spanish.

263
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,890
Her father was.

264
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:24,559
Yeah?

265
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:31,858
I don't believe it.

266
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,028
You finally decided to eat!

267
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,988
Eating and talking!

268
00:32:39,322 --> 00:32:42,074
Before you know it,
you will be back in the land of the living.

269
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,746
You want me to drive?

270
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:50,832
Sure! Think you remember how?

271
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,084
My body remembers.

272
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:00,422
You can sleep while I drive.

273
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,633
OK.

274
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,106
Well, Trav...

275
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:21,901
I think maybe you are ready to...

276
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:25,071
Tell me what the hell happened to you
over the last 4 years.

277
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:28,948
No, not yet.

278
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:06,188
Travis!

279
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:07,731
What?

280
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:25,833
Where are we, Travis?
What happened?

281
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:29,585
Why did we get off the high way.

282
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:32,380
Jesus Christ...

283
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,131
I can't even sleep for 5 minutes
without some crisis.

284
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:36,799
Why did you turn off?

285
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,554
I don't know where I turned off.
Didn't have a name.

286
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:47,224
That's great.

287
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:49,184
That's just damn great.

288
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:53,021
Where we are in the middle of the Mohabi desert
and a place that doesn't have a name.

289
00:34:55,481 --> 00:34:57,567
I could find the high way again.

290
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,295
Trav, I need to talk to you a little
about Hunter.

291
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:23,839
How old is he now?

292
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:26,800
He's eight in January.

293
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:29,887
- She’s seven then.
- Yeah.

294
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:34,599
But see, what I want to talk about is...

295
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:39,854
Well, he's like part of the family now.

296
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:43,983
Ann and me are like his parents now.

297
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:46,526
Ann's your wife.

298
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:48,487
Yeah, you remember her, don't you?

299
00:35:49,278 --> 00:35:51,489
No... Does he think
that you're his father?

300
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:57,328
Well, Ann told him you were coming.

301
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:01,039
Well, who does he think I am?

302
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,669
I told him you are his father.

303
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,044
But see,

304
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:11,296
You've been gone a long time, Trav.

305
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,091
How long have I been gone? Do you know?

306
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:16,843
4 years.

307
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,555
Is 4 years a long time?

308
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,559
It is for a little boy.

309
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,603
It's half his life.

310
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,817
Half a boy's life.

311
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,987
I remember now...

312
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:39,822
What?

313
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,952
Why I bought that land.

314
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:46,661
Oh, why?

315
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:50,038
Well, mama once told me that...

316
00:36:50,372 --> 00:36:52,916
That's where she and daddy first...

317
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,585
Made love.

318
00:36:55,752 --> 00:36:57,296
Oh, in Paris, Texas?

319
00:36:58,672 --> 00:37:00,757
- Yeah.
- She told you that?

320
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:01,757
Yeah.

321
00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:07,597
So... I thought that...

322
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:10,433
that's where I began.

323
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:15,811
I mean me, Travis Calve Henderson.
They named me that.

324
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:18,772
I started out there.

325
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:23,444
- Paris Texas, huh?
- Yeah...

326
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,698
So you think
maybe you were conceived there?

327
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:32,326
Yeah.

328
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:34,120
You could be right, Travis.

329
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:38,584
Daddy always had a joke about it.

330
00:37:39,668 --> 00:37:41,127
What was the joke?

331
00:37:42,295 --> 00:37:44,795
He's... he would introduce mama

332
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:47,465
As the girl he met in Paris.

333
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,383
And then he would wait

334
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:54,470
Before he said Texas,
so everybody thought that...

335
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:57,765
He meant...
He would wait

336
00:37:57,848 --> 00:38:00,476
Before he said Texas
till everybody thought,

337
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,937
After everybody thought
that he was talking about Paris, France.

338
00:38:04,312 --> 00:38:06,813
He always laughed real hard about it.

339
00:38:10,025 --> 00:38:11,861
So you live in Los Angles, huh?

340
00:38:12,862 --> 00:38:14,364
Yeah, well we live in suburbs,

341
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,574
But I've got my business in town.

342
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:18,700
What's your business?

343
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,786
I make billboard signs for advertisements.

344
00:38:22,954 --> 00:38:24,080
Oh, yeah?

345
00:38:25,122 --> 00:38:27,792
You're the one that makes all those...
I love those.

346
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:29,460
Some of them are beautiful.

347
00:38:29,794 --> 00:38:32,127
I'm not the only one in the world
that make's them, Trav.

348
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:57,901
Trav? This way.

349
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,779
Nice, huh?
Just been in here 3 months.

350
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:05,199
I really like it,
but I took a beating financing, I'll tell ya.

351
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:07,827
Like everybody else.

352
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,166
Hi baby.

353
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,711
- Everything OK here?
- Oh, sure...

354
00:39:19,877 --> 00:39:22,045
We just miss you a lot.

355
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:23,505
I missed you too.

356
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:26,633
- Come on in.
- Travis.

357
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:32,973
My God.

358
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:37,267
We were beginning to wonder
if we would ever see you again.

359
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,311
It's been so long.

360
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:42,272
Did you have a good trip?

361
00:39:42,898 --> 00:39:44,190
Yeah, it was fine.

362
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:48,776
Hunter.

363
00:40:01,288 --> 00:40:02,289
Hunter.

364
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:04,416
This is Travis.

365
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:19,638
Hi.

366
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:23,726
Hi.

367
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:37,278
I bet it was really hot
coming across the Mohabis Desert.

368
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:41,657
Yes.

369
00:40:42,115 --> 00:40:43,825
Too bad you had to drive.

370
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:46,286
What happened?

371
00:40:47,454 --> 00:40:50,040
Well, Travis just didn't feel like flying.

372
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:52,416
Oh, I don't blame you.

373
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,668
I can't stand airplanes anymore.

374
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,586
Especially since we live in this house.

375
00:40:57,337 --> 00:41:00,550
All we hear is planes day in and day out.

376
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,717
I like them.

377
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:12,268
You used to fly, didn't you, Travis?

378
00:41:14,811 --> 00:41:16,103
No.

379
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:21,400
Oh, I thought...
I remember

380
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:25,487
Jane telling me
that you flew once to Dallas together.

381
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:27,532
Or somewhere.

382
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:31,993
Maybe I'm mistaken.

383
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,304
Honey.
He hasn't slept in a bed

384
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,806
Since we started, I swear to God.

385
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,058
I don't think that's even necessary.

386
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,562
Where has he been sleeping then?

387
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,148
Well, he doesn't sleep.

388
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,733
He has to sleep somewhere.

389
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:09,234
OK.

390
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:11,986
But I don't think he's even going to use it.

391
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:14,739
He's got to get tired sometime.

392
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:21,410
There is a towel for you, Travis,

393
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:24,330
And some underwear and socks from Walt.

394
00:42:26,498 --> 00:42:27,625
Good night.

395
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,876
Thank you.

396
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:38,217
OK.
Get some shut eye.

397
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:39,843
OK.

398
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:42,471
- Sweet dreams.
- Alright.

399
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:54,032
You polished them.

400
00:43:56,743 --> 00:43:58,745
That's very nice of you Travis.

401
00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:02,999
Would you like to come in
and have some breakfast?

402
00:44:05,457 --> 00:44:06,667
Aren’t you hungry?

403
00:44:08,294 --> 00:44:10,629
We are going to have strawberry waffles.

404
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:12,674
Do you like them?

405
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:15,258
Do you want some?

406
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:29,021
Well, there is hot coffee on the stove
if you want some.

407
00:44:32,065 --> 00:44:33,358
Look at that truck.

408
00:45:11,934 --> 00:45:13,060
Hi.

409
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:50,717
Decided to rough it, huh?

410
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:51,885
Yeah.

411
00:45:53,095 --> 00:45:54,805
What did you do, spit shine these?

412
00:45:55,221 --> 00:45:56,848
I can get you a job
at the airport doing that.

413
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:03,144
Do you want to trade these new boots
for those old boots?

414
00:46:04,271 --> 00:46:05,480
You can wear them.

415
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:09,148
Thank you.

416
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:41,303
Travis? I have to rush off
to get Hunter to school on time.

417
00:46:41,678 --> 00:46:43,471
We will be back this afternoon.

418
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:46,723
Walt's office number is
on the dining room table.

419
00:46:47,515 --> 00:46:48,516
See you later.

420
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:51,144
- OK.
- Bye.

421
00:47:25,297 --> 00:47:26,882
- Ann?
- Yeah?

422
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,178
I was just thinking
maybe I can meet Hunter after school

423
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:32,639
And we could walk home together,
if he wants to.

424
00:47:34,056 --> 00:47:35,641
That sounds like a great idea, Travis.

425
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:41,103
Walk home?
I don't want to walk home mom.

426
00:47:42,438 --> 00:47:45,066
Why walk, everybody drives.

427
00:47:45,691 --> 00:47:46,943
Come on, Hunter

428
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,196
It won't hurt you
once to walk home in your life.

429
00:47:49,612 --> 00:47:51,405
No, no, I don't want to.

430
00:47:52,365 --> 00:47:55,450
Travis, I insist, you are Hunter's father.

431
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,082
And get into the car Hunter.
We are late as it is.

432
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:07,294
You are mean.

433
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,893
- Can I come with you?
- Sure.

434
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:53,345
I'm very sorry about this, Travis.

435
00:49:55,055 --> 00:49:56,930
It's not easy for him, Ann.

436
00:50:04,145 --> 00:50:06,271
Ann, it's OK, he's in here.

437
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:15,948
What are you doing?

438
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:17,533
Driving.

439
00:50:18,575 --> 00:50:19,618
Where to?

440
00:50:20,994 --> 00:50:22,203
Just driving.

441
00:50:23,204 --> 00:50:24,914
You're not hiding out in there, are you?

442
00:50:25,538 --> 00:50:26,539
No.

443
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,753
Hunter. Travis is your real dad,

444
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:35,796
You know that, don't you?

445
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,676
Dad, when are they going to
make spaceships like they...

446
00:50:41,051 --> 00:50:42,511
Make cars?

447
00:50:45,055 --> 00:50:47,598
Hunter, I'm asking you a question.
Can you answer it?

448
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:49,767
What?

449
00:50:53,187 --> 00:50:56,482
Well, Travis went to meet you at school,

450
00:50:56,774 --> 00:50:58,276
And he wanted to walk you home.

451
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:00,944
Nobody walks.

452
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:03,487
That's not the point.

453
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:07,074
Travis is your real dad and...

454
00:51:07,408 --> 00:51:09,034
He wants to talk to you.

455
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:13,872
Why? What about?

456
00:51:16,249 --> 00:51:18,169
OK, come on. Lets go have dinner.

457
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:34,183
Hey Trav? Do you remember that time
when Ann and me came down
to visit you about 5 years ago?

458
00:51:37,436 --> 00:51:38,269
No.

459
00:51:39,228 --> 00:51:41,396
You and Jane were down in Texas,
right there on the coast.

460
00:51:42,564 --> 00:51:43,815
Hunter was about 3.

461
00:51:45,108 --> 00:51:46,151
Don't you remember that?

462
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:50,988
No.

463
00:51:51,197 --> 00:51:53,199
I remember, we went fishing.

464
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:55,534
Yeah.

465
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:59,121
I took some Super Eight on that trip.
And I put it all together?

466
00:51:59,455 --> 00:52:00,829
Thought maybe you might
want to see some of it.

467
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:03,040
What is it?

468
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:05,291
Movies. You know, Super Eight?

469
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:07,668
- Oh.
- Walt.

470
00:52:08,419 --> 00:52:10,379
Maybe Travis doesn't want...

471
00:52:11,672 --> 00:52:12,590
What?

472
00:52:14,342 --> 00:52:17,844
Well, maybe he'd like to wait a while
before he looks at it.

473
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,138
Yeah, it's up to him.

474
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,475
Just thought you might like to see some of it.

475
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,228
Movies? Sure.

476
00:52:26,478 --> 00:52:30,230
Great. There's some great stuff on it.
Some great shots of Hunter on it.

477
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,398
I've already seen it.

478
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,150
Well, you have to see it again.

479
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,946
- Come on, help me set up the projector.
- OK.

480
00:54:06,439 --> 00:54:07,732
That’s me driving.

481
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:10,109
I know, you are going to be good.

482
00:57:15,393 --> 00:57:17,105
Time for bed now, Hunter.

483
00:57:18,189 --> 00:57:20,274
Oh, mom.

484
00:57:20,525 --> 00:57:22,609
Time to go to bed, it's past ten.

485
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:27,196
- Good night dad.
- Good night baby.

486
00:57:33,285 --> 00:57:34,660
Good night dad.

487
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,960
Do you think he still loves her?

488
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,378
How would I know that, Hunter?

489
00:57:46,503 --> 00:57:48,130
I think he does.

490
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,050
How can you tell?

491
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,177
Well, the way he looked at her.

492
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,471
You mean when he saw her in the movie?

493
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,599
Yeah, but that's not her.

494
00:57:59,266 --> 00:58:00,392
What do you mean?

495
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:03,645
That's only her in a movie.

496
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,982
A long time ago.

497
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:10,652
In a galaxy far, far away.

498
00:58:48,434 --> 00:58:49,602
What are you looking for?

499
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:52,436
I'm looking for a...

500
00:58:53,812 --> 00:58:54,730
The father.

501
00:58:55,106 --> 00:58:56,066
Your father?

502
00:58:56,441 --> 00:58:59,401
No, no, just a father.
Any father.

503
00:58:59,777 --> 00:59:01,361
What does a father look like?

504
00:59:01,987 --> 00:59:04,072
There are many different kinds of fathers,
senior Travis.

505
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:06,866
Well, I just need one.

506
00:59:07,241 --> 00:59:08,493
You think you are going to find him in there?

507
00:59:08,826 --> 00:59:10,328
Well, I don't know where else to look.

508
00:59:11,037 --> 00:59:13,664
Oh, I see, you want too look like a father.

509
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,041
Yeah.

510
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:20,419
Tell me, do you want to be a rich father?

511
00:59:22,421 --> 00:59:23,380
No.

512
00:59:23,672 --> 00:59:25,299
- A poor one?
- No.

513
00:59:26,717 --> 00:59:27,886
Than which?

514
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:29,219
In between.

515
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:31,805
No, no. There is no in between, eh?

516
00:59:32,097 --> 00:59:34,182
You either have to be a rich father
or a poor one.

517
00:59:34,557 --> 00:59:35,850
Rich.

518
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:53,907
One thing you must remember.

519
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,909
To be a rich father, senior Travis,
you must look to the sky,

520
00:59:58,076 --> 00:59:59,411
Never to the ground.

521
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:02,873
Little higher.

522
01:00:11,463 --> 01:00:13,298
No... Stand.

523
01:00:14,216 --> 01:00:16,092
You must walk stiff, senior Travis.

524
01:00:25,642 --> 01:00:26,893
Dignity.

525
01:00:43,743 --> 01:00:44,950
You got it.

526
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:07,513
Who is that guy, you know him?

527
01:01:08,514 --> 01:01:10,557
Yeah, he's my father's brother.

528
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:17,480
No... they are both brothers.

529
01:01:17,563 --> 01:01:20,816
No, they are both fathers.

530
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,110
No... ah, forget it.

531
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:27,906
- But both who's fathers?
- My father.

532
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:30,575
How they have two fathers?

533
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:32,283
Just lucky I guess.

534
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:35,535
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

535
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:29,384
That's my dad's suite.

536
01:03:31,303 --> 01:03:32,512
I mean Walt.

537
01:03:32,846 --> 01:03:34,765
That's OK if you call him dad.

538
01:03:35,932 --> 01:03:38,602
Yeah, I borrowed it from him.
He said it was OK.

539
01:03:44,357 --> 01:03:45,815
What are those pictures?

540
01:03:46,775 --> 01:03:48,109
That's my dad.

541
01:03:49,862 --> 01:03:51,280
And your grandfather.

542
01:03:55,157 --> 01:03:56,367
What was his name?

543
01:03:57,368 --> 01:03:58,452
Travis.

544
01:03:58,577 --> 01:04:00,162
Same as yours.

545
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:02,748
Where is he now?

546
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:05,750
He died...

547
01:04:06,667 --> 01:04:08,668
A couple of years after this picture.

548
01:04:09,336 --> 01:04:10,587
In that car.

549
01:04:10,962 --> 01:04:12,881
- Oh, he's dead?
- Uh huh.

550
01:04:14,466 --> 01:04:16,677
But can you feel that he's dead?

551
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:18,512
What do you mean?

552
01:04:19,137 --> 01:04:20,763
You knew him
when he was walking around

553
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:23,516
- And talking. Right?
- Yeah.

554
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,352
So can you feel that he is gone?

555
01:04:28,145 --> 01:04:30,815
Yeah, sometimes.
I know he's dead.

556
01:04:33,232 --> 01:04:35,192
I never felt like you were dead.

557
01:04:35,526 --> 01:04:37,027
I could always feel you were walking

558
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:40,239
Around and talking... some place.

559
01:04:41,031 --> 01:04:42,698
I feel mom too.

560
01:04:43,281 --> 01:04:45,491
- You do?
- Don't you?

561
01:04:46,826 --> 01:04:47,993
Yeah.

562
01:04:51,665 --> 01:04:53,375
That's me when I was in the navy.

563
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:55,878
You were a general?

564
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:59,423
No... This was when I was in the band.

565
01:05:00,215 --> 01:05:01,465
The high school band.

566
01:05:03,718 --> 01:05:07,263
This is you. I like this picture.
Look at that.

567
01:05:08,264 --> 01:05:09,265
That is really wild.

568
01:05:09,598 --> 01:05:12,516
That's weird when it,
when there is water in between

569
01:05:12,516 --> 01:05:15,477
And then it turns into nothing.

570
01:05:17,104 --> 01:05:18,313
That's a great picture.

571
01:05:19,523 --> 01:05:20,982
And this is my mom.

572
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:23,942
Your grandmother.

573
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:30,700
I didn't know.

574
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:35,913
It just seems that...

575
01:05:36,288 --> 01:05:39,291
Everything has changed between us so fast.

576
01:05:39,374 --> 01:05:41,500
Ever since Travis came.

577
01:05:41,792 --> 01:05:43,002
What's changed?

578
01:05:45,171 --> 01:05:46,380
I'm just afraid.

579
01:05:48,174 --> 01:05:49,548
Afraid of Travis?

580
01:05:50,382 --> 01:05:51,342
No...

581
01:05:52,217 --> 01:05:53,719
Then what?

582
01:05:56,305 --> 01:05:59,015
Of what will happen to us if we loose Hunter.

583
01:06:02,769 --> 01:06:04,270
We're not going to loose Hunter.

584
01:06:04,645 --> 01:06:07,315
Then why do you keep pushing them together?

585
01:06:08,024 --> 01:06:10,651
It's almost as if you wanted them to leave.

586
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:13,613
- Who?
- Hunter.

587
01:06:14,863 --> 01:06:17,032
You know what I'm talking about.

588
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:20,617
You keep promoting this
father son business between...

589
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:22,577
It's not business.

590
01:06:23,495 --> 01:06:26,790
Travis is his father,
and Hunter is his son.

591
01:06:27,747 --> 01:06:28,998
That's a fact.

592
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,084
You've known that all along.

593
01:06:32,752 --> 01:06:34,588
Travis happens to be my brother.

594
01:06:34,922 --> 01:06:36,006
I know he is.

595
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,424
Well, what's this promotion bull shit?

596
01:06:38,758 --> 01:06:40,258
You want us to go on pretending...

597
01:06:40,592 --> 01:06:43,053
That we are the parents
of my brother's son?

598
01:06:43,762 --> 01:06:45,514
Well, how long do you want Hunter
to buy that?

599
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:48,100
I was never pretending.

600
01:06:48,392 --> 01:06:52,229
I love him, just like
he was my own flesh and blood.

601
01:06:53,813 --> 01:06:55,022
So do I.

602
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,865
Hi Ann.

603
01:07:07,366 --> 01:07:08,450
Hi Travis.

604
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:11,120
You don't sleep much, do you?

605
01:07:21,128 --> 01:07:22,421
Travis.

606
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,716
There is something I have to tell you.

607
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:27,718
I was not going to,

608
01:07:28,051 --> 01:07:31,554
Because somehow it makes things easier
that nobody knows.

609
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,515
I never even told Walt, or Hunter.

610
01:07:37,267 --> 01:07:38,435
What is it?

611
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,023
After Hunter came to live with us,

612
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:46,191
Jane used to call.

613
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,737
Asking about him.

614
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:54,364
She made me promise not to tell anyone
that she was calling.

615
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:56,324
Did she ask about me?

616
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,746
Yes. In the beginning.

617
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:07,376
Where did she call from?

618
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,420
Places in Texas.

619
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,172
What places?

620
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:17,595
Let me finish, Travis.

621
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:23,724
After what happened
between you and Jane...

622
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,853
She decided Hunter should be with us.

623
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,231
She said she couldn't be a mother to him anymore.

624
01:08:40,405 --> 01:08:43,408
She stopped being a mother to him
a long time before that.

625
01:08:56,454 --> 01:08:59,123
Travis. I don't want to feel I'm...

626
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:01,627
Hiding something from you anymore.

627
01:09:07,467 --> 01:09:08,718
She was young...

628
01:09:14,725 --> 01:09:15,935
She wanted something,

629
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,313
But I just couldn't figure out what it was.

630
01:09:25,363 --> 01:09:28,075
I just didn't realize how much rage I had.

631
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,754
A little more than a year ago
she stopped calling.

632
01:09:40,339 --> 01:09:42,425
I haven't heard from her since then.

633
01:09:44,093 --> 01:09:45,094
Nothing?

634
01:09:46,763 --> 01:09:47,764
Not a word.

635
01:09:49,224 --> 01:09:50,810
But on the last call,

636
01:09:52,395 --> 01:09:55,441
She asked for me
to open a bank account for Hunter.

637
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:58,652
A bank account?

638
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,323
All I know about Jane now is...

639
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:04,034
She goes to this bank.

640
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,870
On the 5th of each month...

641
01:10:07,538 --> 01:10:09,540
And wires money for Hunter.

642
01:10:14,254 --> 01:10:16,340
Jane, still sends him money.

643
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:22,221
Sometimes a hundred dollars,
sometimes 50, or 5...

644
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:24,892
For Hunter's future.

645
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:28,063
I had the bank trace the wire.

646
01:10:29,397 --> 01:10:31,107
It comes from a bank in Huston.

647
01:10:31,733 --> 01:10:33,109
What bank?

648
01:10:34,528 --> 01:10:37,323
I wrote it down if you want it.

649
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:41,995
What's the date today?

650
01:10:42,537 --> 01:10:44,164
The first of November.

651
01:10:49,921 --> 01:10:52,674
I don't think we should do that. You're right.

652
01:10:56,179 --> 01:10:57,806
I meant the other thing.

653
01:11:17,704 --> 01:11:21,917
You will all be caught
with your diapers down.

654
01:11:22,292 --> 01:11:23,919
That is a promise!

655
01:11:24,461 --> 01:11:28,426
I give you this promise on my mother's head!

656
01:11:28,968 --> 01:11:34,683
For right here today,
standing on the very head of my mother.

657
01:11:34,975 --> 01:11:37,644
Which is how a god treats her.

658
01:11:38,061 --> 01:11:41,692
Which everybody who wasn't bought
in a fucking store.

659
01:11:42,026 --> 01:11:46,447
Wanna know and understand
to the very letter what death holds.

660
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:50,910
They will invade you in your beds,

661
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:54,582
They will snap you from your hot tubs.

662
01:11:55,624 --> 01:11:59,670
They will pluck you right
out of your expensive sports cars.

663
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:02,675
There is no where.

664
01:12:04,677 --> 01:12:06,346
Absolutely no where...

665
01:12:06,846 --> 01:12:09,391
In this God forsaken valley.

666
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:14,981
I'm talking about from the rage
of my voice right here...

667
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:18,485
Clear out to the goddamn
Mojave desert.

668
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:22,740
And beyond that.
Clear up this mess though.

669
01:12:24,492 --> 01:12:27,703
For everywhere else in the valley
always had a sona.

670
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:32,000
None of that area will be
called the safety zone.

671
01:12:32,668 --> 01:12:34,755
There will be no safety zone.

672
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:37,007
I can guarantee this safety zone...

673
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:38,842
Will be eliminated,

674
01:12:39,009 --> 01:12:40,552
Eradicated.

675
01:12:41,388 --> 01:12:45,975
You will all be exerdited
to the land of no return.

676
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,355
It's eradication to no where.

677
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:52,608
And if you think that's going to be fun,

678
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:55,278
You've got another thing coming.

679
01:12:57,447 --> 01:12:59,616
They made me a slime bucket.

680
01:12:59,991 --> 01:13:04,163
But believe me,
I know what the hell I'm talking about.

681
01:13:04,831 --> 01:13:06,375
I'm not crazy.

682
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:11,089
And don't say I didn't warn you.
I warned you.

683
01:13:11,506 --> 01:13:13,091
I warned all of you.

684
01:13:24,563 --> 01:13:26,314
Thought you were afraid of heights.

685
01:13:26,982 --> 01:13:29,610
No, I'm not afraid of heights,
I'm afraid of falling.

686
01:13:30,403 --> 01:13:32,155
Oh, yeah? Well then just don't look down.

687
01:13:35,868 --> 01:13:38,537
To bad the things don't look
the same on the ground.

688
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:40,457
What do you mean?

689
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,170
Things are clearer up here.

690
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,214
Might clear things up.

691
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,885
Yeah, I had a talk with Ann last night.

692
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:52,179
Yeah, she is pretty upset.

693
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:54,556
Yeah, I know.

694
01:13:56,642 --> 01:13:57,602
I'm going to leave.

695
01:13:58,311 --> 01:14:00,313
- What?
- I'm leaving.

696
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:04,651
I didn't tell you this in order to make you leave.
I'm not trying to get rid of you, Travis.

697
01:14:04,777 --> 01:14:07,071
- I know that.
- Well, what good is that going to do?

698
01:14:07,071 --> 01:14:08,823
- I wanna...
- That's not going to solve anything.

699
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:11,659
I'm going to go find Jane.

700
01:14:13,204 --> 01:14:14,497
How you going to do that?

701
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:17,250
It's been four years.
She's completely disappeared.

702
01:14:17,626 --> 01:14:19,503
I tried to find her, I tried everything,
I couldn't find her.

703
01:14:19,836 --> 01:14:22,382
Now, I haven't tried yet.
I can find her.

704
01:14:22,548 --> 01:14:23,508
What make's you so sure?

705
01:14:23,841 --> 01:14:25,259
Oh, I just know.

706
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:27,136
Can we go down now?

707
01:14:27,261 --> 01:14:30,766
No! God damn it!

708
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,435
You tell me what happened Travis!

709
01:14:33,852 --> 01:14:35,313
I'm sick of this fucking mystery!

710
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:37,315
I've been treating you
like a spoiled kid...

711
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:38,983
Ever since I picked you up in the desert.

712
01:14:39,317 --> 01:14:42,154
Now you tell me what happened,
with you and Jane!

713
01:14:43,197 --> 01:14:44,031
Shit!

714
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:47,744
I know it's none of my business.

715
01:14:49,205 --> 01:14:52,041
Uh, well, I need to take...

716
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:55,379
Money, credit cards.

717
01:14:55,879 --> 01:14:57,464
Alright, sure, you can have them.

718
01:14:57,631 --> 01:14:58,757
You know you'll get it back.

719
01:14:59,049 --> 01:15:00,592
Oh, forget that. You can have them.

720
01:15:01,135 --> 01:15:02,429
I want to find her, Walt.

721
01:15:28,626 --> 01:15:29,795
Hunter!

722
01:15:39,806 --> 01:15:41,099
That your car?

723
01:15:45,063 --> 01:15:47,565
Yup! Come on!

724
01:15:49,318 --> 01:15:50,528
Radical.

725
01:16:04,378 --> 01:16:06,129
This is not bad stuff.

726
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:10,134
Ann puts it in lunch everyday.

727
01:16:10,468 --> 01:16:13,429
Lavash, Ki, Ri. Sticky.

728
01:16:13,721 --> 01:16:15,098
Lavash, what?

729
01:16:17,267 --> 01:16:18,852
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

730
01:16:19,436 --> 01:16:20,854
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

731
01:16:22,314 --> 01:16:23,692
I like it.

732
01:16:25,903 --> 01:16:27,571
- Dad.
- Yap?

733
01:16:28,155 --> 01:16:29,825
Where did you go all that time?

734
01:16:33,286 --> 01:16:34,538
Mexico.

735
01:16:35,163 --> 01:16:36,582
How come?

736
01:16:38,418 --> 01:16:40,128
I didn't know where else to go.

737
01:16:42,463 --> 01:16:43,757
Where did mom go?

738
01:16:45,676 --> 01:16:46,719
I don't know.

739
01:16:47,678 --> 01:16:49,304
But right now, she is somewhere in Huston.

740
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:51,683
That's where the space center is.

741
01:16:55,646 --> 01:16:57,733
And that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

742
01:16:58,734 --> 01:17:00,026
I have to go away now.

743
01:17:00,736 --> 01:17:01,695
Why?

744
01:17:02,822 --> 01:17:04,073
Because I'm going to find her.

745
01:17:04,323 --> 01:17:07,452
What about me, you just found me.
Can I come with?

746
01:17:12,624 --> 01:17:13,667
What about Walt and Ann?

747
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,588
We would never come back here?

748
01:17:16,963 --> 01:17:18,214
Sure, but...

749
01:17:19,382 --> 01:17:20,383
I don't know when.

750
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:31,773
I want to come with.

751
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,737
I want to find her too.

752
01:17:37,362 --> 01:17:38,614
When do we go?

753
01:17:44,037 --> 01:17:45,038
Right now.

754
01:17:45,455 --> 01:17:46,998
Then, come on, lets go.

755
01:17:47,665 --> 01:17:50,252
First we have to stop
to get supplies for the trip.

756
01:17:50,336 --> 01:17:51,170
OK.

757
01:18:06,814 --> 01:18:08,565
We got to buy jackets, tee shirts,

758
01:18:08,565 --> 01:18:10,610
Tooth brushes, stuff like that.

759
01:18:10,735 --> 01:18:12,612
Maybe even walky talkies.

760
01:18:13,113 --> 01:18:14,572
Talkies of course.

761
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:16,282
Just in case.

762
01:18:26,086 --> 01:18:27,421
Do you know what?

763
01:18:27,879 --> 01:18:28,922
What?

764
01:18:30,509 --> 01:18:33,972
This whole galaxy, the whole universe...

765
01:18:34,305 --> 01:18:38,102
Used to be compressed
into a tiny spot this big.

766
01:18:39,019 --> 01:18:41,522
- And you know what happened?
- What?

767
01:18:42,356 --> 01:18:44,901
It went "Phchue..."
and blew up.

768
01:18:45,277 --> 01:18:48,572
All the spark, flying every place,

769
01:18:48,864 --> 01:18:50,700
In space...

770
01:18:51,576 --> 01:18:53,494
It was just gas. It was flowing around.

771
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:54,871
The earth was?

772
01:18:55,204 --> 01:18:57,207
Yeah, the earth was really gas.

773
01:18:57,583 --> 01:19:00,961
And the sun formed, and it was so hot...

774
01:19:01,253 --> 01:19:05,759
That the earth just formed
into one hard ball.

775
01:19:06,217 --> 01:19:08,888
Of ocean. Nothing but ocean.

776
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,641
So there was sea animals and...

777
01:19:11,683 --> 01:19:15,395
Under the water,
a volcano went..."Pachooo"

778
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:18,566
And... The hot lava hit the water...

779
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:21,652
And formed rock to make land.

780
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:35,960
If you want to make a collect call,

781
01:19:36,252 --> 01:19:38,089
You dial the operator and tell her that...

782
01:19:38,214 --> 01:19:39,299
I know.

783
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:42,052
Good, then call Walt and Ann.

784
01:19:42,427 --> 01:19:43,386
Why?

785
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:45,807
Because, so they don't worry about you,

786
01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:46,933
So they know where you are.

787
01:19:47,308 --> 01:19:48,893
But what am I going to say?

788
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:50,269
Just tell them the truth.

789
01:19:50,646 --> 01:19:54,024
Tell them that you are with me,
and on to Texas.

790
01:19:54,817 --> 01:19:56,360
They are going to flip out.

791
01:19:56,693 --> 01:19:59,364
No... but you can handle it.

792
01:19:59,489 --> 01:20:00,573
OK?

793
01:20:00,824 --> 01:20:02,283
Why can't you do it?

794
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:04,203
I can't do it.

795
01:20:05,621 --> 01:20:06,705
Why?

796
01:20:06,831 --> 01:20:09,083
Because it has to be you.

797
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:14,549
Oh, jeez...

798
01:20:14,966 --> 01:20:16,926
Why can't he do anything?

799
01:20:23,142 --> 01:20:24,727
- Hello.
- Hi dad.

800
01:20:24,936 --> 01:20:26,479
Hunter. Where are you?

801
01:20:26,813 --> 01:20:29,315
You know what time it is?
I've been calling everywhere looking for you.

802
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:35,531
Yeah, yeah. Hunter, just listen to me now.

803
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:38,034
Where are you, exactly?

804
01:20:40,662 --> 01:20:42,247
St. Vernidino?

805
01:20:42,706 --> 01:20:45,669
Hunter, what do you mean
you are in St. Vernidino?

806
01:20:46,211 --> 01:20:47,087
Wait a minute honey.

807
01:20:47,254 --> 01:20:48,922
- How did...
- Let me talk to him.

808
01:20:50,132 --> 01:20:51,259
Hunter.

809
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:53,470
Are you alright?

810
01:20:53,678 --> 01:20:54,763
Yeah.

811
01:20:55,305 --> 01:20:56,806
What are you doing?

812
01:20:59,226 --> 01:21:00,978
With Travis?

813
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:05,192
Why are you going?

814
01:21:07,944 --> 01:21:11,741
Tell me where you are Hunter.
Just tell me where you are.

815
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:15,453
What's the name of it?

816
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:17,999
Oh, my god.

817
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,293
Hunter.

818
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:23,755
You tell Travis, to turn around...

819
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:26,675
And come back right now.

820
01:21:27,092 --> 01:21:28,552
Do you understand me?

821
01:21:29,512 --> 01:21:30,679
Let me talk to him.

822
01:21:32,057 --> 01:21:33,517
What should I do?

823
01:21:34,476 --> 01:21:36,269
Just hang up.

824
01:21:39,023 --> 01:21:40,942
Bye mom. Got to go now.

825
01:21:43,361 --> 01:21:44,362
Hunter...?

826
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:47,282
Hunter!

827
01:22:04,721 --> 01:22:05,722
Did they flip out?

828
01:22:06,098 --> 01:22:07,349
Yeah, she did.

829
01:22:07,975 --> 01:22:09,810
You're not sorry you came, are you?

830
01:22:09,893 --> 01:22:10,769
No.

831
01:22:11,145 --> 01:22:13,898
Well, you can go back to them
any time you want.

832
01:22:14,274 --> 01:22:15,316
You just tell me, OK?

833
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:17,152
I don't want to go back.

834
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:20,865
Well, I know, but just in case
you change your mind.

835
01:23:07,253 --> 01:23:09,714
I'm so used to calling her mom.

836
01:23:12,009 --> 01:23:13,302
Ann?

837
01:23:14,053 --> 01:23:14,929
Yeah.

838
01:23:20,143 --> 01:23:22,437
She sounded so sad.

839
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:26,692
I know.

840
01:23:30,823 --> 01:23:33,284
What do you think mom will look like now?

841
01:23:38,123 --> 01:23:39,375
I don't know.

842
01:23:42,711 --> 01:23:44,171
Do you remember her?

843
01:23:45,257 --> 01:23:49,010
Not really.
Only from that little movie we saw.

844
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:00,023
You look happy then.

845
01:24:01,526 --> 01:24:02,485
Yeah.

846
01:24:09,326 --> 01:24:10,786
You can keep that.

847
01:24:28,974 --> 01:24:29,933
Night.

848
01:25:11,817 --> 01:25:16,739
Dad, if a guy put a baby down,

849
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:19,953
Traveled at the speed of light
for an hour,

850
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:22,705
If he traveled at the speed of light,

851
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:25,835
He would come back in an hour,

852
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:27,461
He would be an hour older,

853
01:25:27,545 --> 01:25:30,714
But the little baby would be a very old man.

854
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:33,760
Oh, yeah?

855
01:25:33,885 --> 01:25:36,304
So, how long would it take him
to get to Huston?

856
01:25:39,475 --> 01:25:42,020
Ah, if they were to travel...

857
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:44,690
I would say about 3 seconds.

858
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:49,237
Ah, over, I didn't get that last part.

859
01:25:50,989 --> 01:25:52,741
It would take them 3 seconds...

860
01:25:53,075 --> 01:25:54,952
To get from California to Huston.

861
01:25:56,036 --> 01:25:57,746
At light speed.

862
01:26:06,382 --> 01:26:08,676
- This is Huston?
- Yup.

863
01:26:09,218 --> 01:26:12,180
How are we going to find her
in a big city like this?

864
01:26:12,556 --> 01:26:14,851
- I know where she'll be.
- Where?

865
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:18,855
A bank. She's going to deposit
some money at a certain bank today.

866
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:23,903
This is a bank?

867
01:26:24,653 --> 01:26:26,573
What kind of a bank is this?

868
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,700
Looks like a drive in.

869
01:26:29,034 --> 01:26:31,286
I've never seen a bank like that.

870
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:33,623
Me neither.

871
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:37,627
There are so many cars...
We'll never find her.

872
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,047
Oh, yeah, we will. Come on.

873
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,258
We will split up and then
we will cover more ground. OK?

874
01:26:44,134 --> 01:26:46,305
Yeah, we could use the walky talkies.

875
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:48,516
Hey, now you're going.

876
01:26:48,849 --> 01:26:51,060
- I'll let you out here.
- OK.

877
01:26:58,235 --> 01:27:00,071
Can you hear me dad? Over.

878
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,281
Loud and clear.

879
01:27:04,075 --> 01:27:04,909
Good.

880
01:27:30,439 --> 01:27:31,983
Hunter in position one. Over.

881
01:27:33,067 --> 01:27:35,821
Travis in position two.
We got it covered.

882
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:39,116
I told you it would be
more than a toy. Over.

883
01:27:39,449 --> 01:27:41,327
Ten four. Over and out.

884
01:29:21,697 --> 01:29:24,116
Dad, she is just leaving the building.

885
01:29:24,491 --> 01:29:25,659
Get over here.

886
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:28,831
Dad, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

887
01:29:33,627 --> 01:29:37,173
She's leaving the building.
Get over here!

888
01:29:38,091 --> 01:29:39,551
Dad!

889
01:29:39,968 --> 01:29:41,345
Come on!

890
01:29:41,846 --> 01:29:44,348
Dad! Wake up!

891
01:29:44,974 --> 01:29:47,895
Wake up! She is leaving the bank.

892
01:29:48,854 --> 01:29:50,439
Dad! Wake up!

893
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:54,569
Wh... Where is... duh...

894
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,946
I'm on my way.

895
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:58,990
Oh, no.

896
01:30:18,805 --> 01:30:20,432
She went that way!

897
01:30:21,226 --> 01:30:22,727
Which way did she go?

898
01:30:23,102 --> 01:30:24,687
Hunter! Come on!

899
01:30:43,627 --> 01:30:46,797
Hunter, did you really
get a good look at her, or what?

900
01:30:47,172 --> 01:30:49,676
It was the right one,
I know it was her.

901
01:30:49,801 --> 01:30:51,844
Oh, god. We have lost her.

902
01:30:52,303 --> 01:30:54,682
Can this piece of junk go faster?

903
01:30:56,475 --> 01:30:58,852
There are 10 thousand cars here,
how are we going to find it?

904
01:30:58,978 --> 01:30:59,937
I don't know which one is it.

905
01:31:00,312 --> 01:31:01,856
Go faster dad, go faster.

906
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,568
Hunter, what color...
the car was red, right?

907
01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:07,488
Yeah, a little red Chevy.

908
01:31:12,369 --> 01:31:14,747
Do you see anything?
I don't know what it looks like.

909
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:17,166
You'll have to help me look,
can you see it?

910
01:31:17,417 --> 01:31:19,043
No, not yet.

911
01:31:21,463 --> 01:31:24,049
- I see it! I see it!
- Where, where?

912
01:31:24,925 --> 01:31:27,094
Over in that lane, in that lane!

913
01:31:27,219 --> 01:31:28,346
Which, which lane?

914
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,808
- The right one!
- Alright, settle down, I see it.

915
01:31:36,105 --> 01:31:39,066
See if it's her. Can you tell?

916
01:31:40,819 --> 01:31:42,655
I can't tell.

917
01:31:42,947 --> 01:31:45,033
Wait a minute, there's two red cars now.

918
01:31:45,825 --> 01:31:47,118
Which one is it?

919
01:31:48,579 --> 01:31:50,080
Ah, the right!
The left one!

920
01:31:50,539 --> 01:31:52,708
- You sure?
- Yeah, the left one.

921
01:31:59,382 --> 01:32:01,719
- You sure this is the one though.
- Yeah.

922
01:32:06,891 --> 01:32:11,898
I hope you are right Hunter,
if we are following the wrong car,
we are going to wait a whole another month.

923
01:32:12,357 --> 01:32:13,317
I'll be eight then.

924
01:32:13,734 --> 01:32:14,652
You'll be what?

925
01:32:14,986 --> 01:32:16,655
I'll be eight then.

926
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,538
Lets get closer, we can wave.

927
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:28,752
No, no... we don't want to get too close.
We might scare her,

928
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:30,295
She'll have a wreck or something.

929
01:32:32,256 --> 01:32:34,967
- OK?
- OK. I guess so.

930
01:32:45,438 --> 01:32:48,943
Well, I wonder where she is going.

931
01:32:49,402 --> 01:32:51,654
Maybe to work.
What do you think?

932
01:32:52,655 --> 01:32:54,156
Yeah, could be.

933
01:34:06,116 --> 01:34:07,868
Looks like a girls car to me.

934
01:34:08,535 --> 01:34:10,080
Could it be hers?

935
01:34:12,374 --> 01:34:14,960
Could be... get in the truck
and I'll tell you my plan.

936
01:34:15,043 --> 01:34:15,836
OK.

937
01:34:24,681 --> 01:34:27,850
Roll the windows up, lock the doors,
and if anybody talks to you,

938
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:31,689
Tell them your daddy’s inside
and he'll be right back. OK?

939
01:34:31,689 --> 01:34:32,481
OK.

940
01:34:33,065 --> 01:34:34,525
- You OK?
- Yap.

941
01:35:03,268 --> 01:35:07,814
Sergeant Jojo, call for you, booth 22.
Sergeant Jojo, booth 22.

942
01:35:08,315 --> 01:35:10,860
Come in, no bets,
you guys are going to love this.

943
01:35:11,027 --> 01:35:13,321
The girls here spend so much time
with a guy that...

944
01:35:13,571 --> 01:35:14,905
Most of them live alone.

945
01:35:15,072 --> 01:35:17,075
But it's tough to live alone in a city like this.

946
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:18,702
A lot of violent things happen here.

947
01:35:19,328 --> 01:35:21,496
Stuff like rape, like murder,

948
01:35:21,747 --> 01:35:23,666
That's why we have a police force.

949
01:36:23,697 --> 01:36:24,781
Sir?

950
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:28,535
Sir, you are in the wrong place.

951
01:36:30,746 --> 01:36:32,832
It's too early, all the girls are downstairs.

952
01:36:37,255 --> 01:36:39,799
Please get a ride, cus I'm getting crazy.

953
01:38:37,061 --> 01:38:38,314
Yeah, who do you want?

954
01:38:38,647 --> 01:38:43,152
Yeah, I want to see a blond girl
with kinda short straight hair, about 25 years old.

955
01:38:44,112 --> 01:38:45,071
OK.

956
01:38:45,573 --> 01:38:47,783
She's coming down,
stay on the line.

957
01:39:06,806 --> 01:39:07,807
Hello honey.

958
01:39:10,226 --> 01:39:11,646
Oh, mercy.

959
01:39:12,063 --> 01:39:16,067
You know, 23, I work 23
of the 24 bids in this place,

960
01:39:18,905 --> 01:39:20,448
unless I make 24.

961
01:39:22,075 --> 01:39:24,077
What can I do for you today?

962
01:39:26,163 --> 01:39:27,456
I have an idea.

963
01:39:28,207 --> 01:39:29,750
How about water polo?

964
01:39:31,836 --> 01:39:33,046
Fun.

965
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:37,050
Oh, well...

966
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,886
Tell you what.

967
01:39:39,261 --> 01:39:41,931
Why don't you just tell nurse Piffs
what your pain is.

968
01:39:42,056 --> 01:39:43,432
Maybe I can find a cure... hmm?

969
01:39:43,724 --> 01:39:45,394
Well, why don't you look at me?

970
01:39:45,727 --> 01:39:47,270
I am looking at you.

971
01:39:47,562 --> 01:39:50,399
Yeah, but I'm over here,
can't you see me?

972
01:39:50,691 --> 01:39:53,946
Listen sweet heart, if I can see you,
I wouldn't be working here.

973
01:39:54,863 --> 01:39:56,949
Well, what do you see?

974
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:01,371
See what you see.
Nurse Bibbs.

975
01:40:02,163 --> 01:40:04,207
Nurse Bibbs and a rubber horse.

976
01:40:05,126 --> 01:40:07,962
Oh, oh, I see.

977
01:40:09,547 --> 01:40:11,633
Thank you Nurse Bibbs.

978
01:40:11,967 --> 01:40:13,260
Thank you.

979
01:41:23,509 --> 01:41:24,718
Hi.

980
01:41:29,266 --> 01:41:30,685
Are you out there?

981
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:36,858
Well, I see your light's still on,
so you must be out there.

982
01:41:42,949 --> 01:41:44,659
It's OK if you don't want to talk,

983
01:41:44,742 --> 01:41:47,246
I don't want to talk either sometimes.

984
01:41:49,123 --> 01:41:51,083
I'd just like to stay silent.

985
01:41:57,924 --> 01:41:59,343
Do you mind if I sit down?

986
01:42:09,355 --> 01:42:11,984
Do you mind if I sit down?

987
01:42:14,153 --> 01:42:15,195
No.

988
01:42:18,365 --> 01:42:19,326
Thanks.

989
01:42:20,285 --> 01:42:23,581
Legs get a little tired from standing all the time.

990
01:42:27,711 --> 01:42:29,546
Is this your first visit here?

991
01:42:30,839 --> 01:42:31,757
Yes.

992
01:42:35,429 --> 01:42:38,557
Well, this whole thing must seem
kinda strange to you, huh?

993
01:42:39,309 --> 01:42:42,395
You realize that I can't see you even
though you can see me.

994
01:42:43,271 --> 01:42:45,357
Well, that takes a little getting used to.

995
01:42:50,613 --> 01:42:52,616
Am I looking at your face now?

996
01:43:02,669 --> 01:43:04,337
It don't matter.

997
01:43:19,231 --> 01:43:21,650
If there is anything you want to talk about.

998
01:43:21,775 --> 01:43:24,027
I'll just listen. Alright?

999
01:43:25,905 --> 01:43:28,574
I'm a real good listener.

1000
01:43:40,715 --> 01:43:42,550
Is there something...

1001
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:46,096
Is there something I can do for you?

1002
01:43:55,857 --> 01:43:58,109
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?

1003
01:44:00,946 --> 01:44:02,740
I'll just take off my sweater.

1004
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:04,700
No, no. Don't.

1005
01:44:05,743 --> 01:44:07,912
Please, please leave it on.

1006
01:44:16,381 --> 01:44:17,466
I'm sorry.

1007
01:44:21,763 --> 01:44:24,766
I just don't know exactly
what it is you want.

1008
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:28,645
I don't want anything.

1009
01:44:31,023 --> 01:44:33,068
So why did you come here then?

1010
01:44:43,079 --> 01:44:44,914
I want to talk to you.

1011
01:45:06,189 --> 01:45:08,234
Is there something you want to tell me?

1012
01:45:12,154 --> 01:45:13,156
No...

1013
01:45:18,538 --> 01:45:21,375
You can tell me, I can keep a secret.

1014
01:45:32,595 --> 01:45:36,058
Is it all you do, just talk?

1015
01:45:40,022 --> 01:45:41,773
Well, yeah.

1016
01:45:44,067 --> 01:45:45,527
Yeah, mostly.

1017
01:45:46,194 --> 01:45:47,656
And listen.

1018
01:45:52,287 --> 01:45:53,831
What else do you do?

1019
01:46:05,052 --> 01:46:06,553
Why are you laughing?

1020
01:46:06,929 --> 01:46:08,139
I'm sorry.

1021
01:46:12,810 --> 01:46:13,854
I'm sorry.

1022
01:46:15,522 --> 01:46:17,691
So, what else do you do?

1023
01:46:20,069 --> 01:46:21,863
Nothing, really.

1024
01:46:24,742 --> 01:46:27,662
Oh, well, we are not allowed
to see the customers out of here.

1025
01:46:29,998 --> 01:46:34,128
What if you see them,
do you go home with them?

1026
01:46:35,797 --> 01:46:37,465
No sir, we don't.

1027
01:46:40,344 --> 01:46:43,722
We're not allowed to have any outside
relationships with the customers.

1028
01:46:44,014 --> 01:46:46,725
Yeah, but you can really see them
if you want too, can't you.

1029
01:46:46,725 --> 01:46:49,604
I mean you can go home with them,
if you want to, all these places say that.

1030
01:46:49,771 --> 01:46:53,608
I mean, how much extra money do you make?
How much money do you make on the side?

1031
01:47:06,457 --> 01:47:07,501
I'm sorry,

1032
01:47:07,584 --> 01:47:10,421
Sir, I think you maybe want to talk
to one of the other girls.

1033
01:47:10,546 --> 01:47:12,881
I'll see if I can find one for you.

1034
01:47:12,881 --> 01:47:14,884
No, no, no. No!

1035
01:47:15,552 --> 01:47:17,095
Please.

1036
01:47:19,347 --> 01:47:20,891
Please don't go.

1037
01:47:25,938 --> 01:47:28,900
I just don't think
I'm the one you want to talk to.

1038
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:32,655
Please.

1039
01:47:34,074 --> 01:47:35,909
Please don't go, I'm sorry.

1040
01:47:45,628 --> 01:47:46,671
Alright.

1041
01:47:53,971 --> 01:47:55,015
I'm sorry.

1042
01:48:02,816 --> 01:48:03,901
That's OK.

1043
01:48:16,082 --> 01:48:19,376
I know how hard it is
to talk to strangers sometimes.

1044
01:48:24,925 --> 01:48:26,468
Just relax.

1045
01:48:28,388 --> 01:48:30,515
Relax and tell me
what's on your mind.

1046
01:48:33,101 --> 01:48:34,478
I'll listen.

1047
01:48:37,023 --> 01:48:37,982
To you...

1048
01:48:43,656 --> 01:48:45,699
I don't mind listening.

1049
01:48:54,126 --> 01:48:56,337
I do it all the time.

1050
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:19,532
She was there, wasn't she?

1051
01:49:58,578 --> 01:49:59,954
What's that?

1052
01:50:06,212 --> 01:50:07,379
A vacant lot.

1053
01:50:08,256 --> 01:50:09,966
I bought that land
when we were all together,

1054
01:50:10,592 --> 01:50:11,843
With your mom.

1055
01:50:15,557 --> 01:50:18,435
Thought we might live there someday.

1056
01:50:20,771 --> 01:50:21,856
Where?

1057
01:50:22,774 --> 01:50:23,983
Paris.

1058
01:50:25,068 --> 01:50:26,069
Texas.

1059
01:50:26,402 --> 01:50:27,487
Where's that?

1060
01:50:29,156 --> 01:50:31,033
Across the red river.

1061
01:50:36,206 --> 01:50:37,499
Do you like it?

1062
01:50:39,418 --> 01:50:40,961
Mean we live on dirt?

1063
01:50:56,522 --> 01:50:59,442
Why do you drink that stuff?
It stinks.

1064
01:51:01,444 --> 01:51:02,904
Wait a minute, where are you going?

1065
01:51:03,321 --> 01:51:04,698
To the truck.

1066
01:51:25,014 --> 01:51:26,348
Have another one?

1067
01:52:36,223 --> 01:52:39,269
This is not a place to bring a fancy woman.

1068
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:46,444
Would you say, if you had a fancy woman,
would you bring her in a place like this?

1069
01:52:47,069 --> 01:52:48,946
What's a fancy woman?

1070
01:53:09,305 --> 01:53:10,264
My mother.

1071
01:53:13,058 --> 01:53:14,643
Not your mother.

1072
01:53:15,936 --> 01:53:17,230
But my mother.

1073
01:53:17,898 --> 01:53:20,192
Was not a fancy woman.

1074
01:53:20,442 --> 01:53:21,985
She was...

1075
01:53:28,284 --> 01:53:32,540
She never wanted to be a fancy woman.
She never even pretended to be a fancy woman.

1076
01:53:33,541 --> 01:53:35,001
Then what was she?

1077
01:53:35,919 --> 01:53:37,963
She was just plain.

1078
01:53:40,424 --> 01:53:42,259
Just plain, good.

1079
01:53:43,512 --> 01:53:45,388
She was very good.

1080
01:53:46,014 --> 01:53:47,224
But my daddy...

1081
01:53:50,228 --> 01:53:52,230
See, my daddy had...

1082
01:53:53,189 --> 01:53:54,899
He had this idea...

1083
01:53:55,233 --> 01:53:59,113
He had this idea that was kind of...

1084
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:01,949
Kind of a sickness...

1085
01:54:03,536 --> 01:54:04,495
What idea?

1086
01:54:05,329 --> 01:54:07,414
He had this idea about her.

1087
01:54:11,294 --> 01:54:12,838
He looked at her...

1088
01:54:14,339 --> 01:54:16,133
But he didn't see her.

1089
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:20,388
He...

1090
01:54:21,013 --> 01:54:22,849
He saw this idea.

1091
01:54:26,478 --> 01:54:30,859
And he told people
that she was from Paris.

1092
01:54:32,902 --> 01:54:34,529
A big joke.

1093
01:54:34,863 --> 01:54:36,658
He started telling everybody all the time,

1094
01:54:37,033 --> 01:54:39,119
Finally it wasn't a joke anymore.

1095
01:54:42,372 --> 01:54:44,000
He started believing it.

1096
01:54:46,043 --> 01:54:47,170
And...

1097
01:54:47,712 --> 01:54:49,380
He actually believed...

1098
01:54:52,301 --> 01:54:53,510
She...

1099
01:54:54,428 --> 01:54:55,721
Oh, God.

1100
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:59,017
She would get so embarrassed.

1101
01:55:01,519 --> 01:55:02,562
She'd...

1102
01:55:03,731 --> 01:55:05,191
She was so...

1103
01:55:08,028 --> 01:55:09,988
She was so shy...

1104
01:55:59,046 --> 01:56:00,631
Lominos, cha, cha.

1105
01:56:29,791 --> 01:56:31,002
Left, dad.

1106
01:56:46,896 --> 01:56:48,772
Hunter, it's me.

1107
01:56:51,902 --> 01:56:55,113
I was afraid I'd never be able to say
the right words to you,

1108
01:56:55,489 --> 01:56:57,032
In person.

1109
01:56:57,867 --> 01:57:01,621
So, I'm trying to do it like this.

1110
01:57:04,875 --> 01:57:07,794
When I first saw you, this time

1111
01:57:08,962 --> 01:57:10,255
at Walts...

1112
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:15,136
I was hoping for all kinds of things.

1113
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:20,852
I was hoping to show you
that I was your father.

1114
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:25,358
You showed me I was.

1115
01:57:29,111 --> 01:57:31,365
But the biggest thing I hoped for...

1116
01:57:34,284 --> 01:57:35,911
Can't come true.

1117
01:57:38,581 --> 01:57:40,166
I know that now.

1118
01:57:43,044 --> 01:57:44,880
You belong together with your mother.

1119
01:57:47,508 --> 01:57:49,802
You belong together with your mother.

1120
01:57:52,014 --> 01:57:54,392
It was me that tore you apart.

1121
01:57:55,059 --> 01:57:58,188
And I owe it to you
to bring you back together.

1122
01:58:00,357 --> 01:58:02,234
But I can't stay with you.

1123
01:58:02,693 --> 01:58:04,863
I could never heal up what happened.

1124
01:58:06,072 --> 01:58:08,491
It's just the way it is.

1125
01:58:10,076 --> 01:58:12,872
I can't even hardly remember what happened...

1126
01:58:13,581 --> 01:58:14,999
It's like a gap.

1127
01:58:15,916 --> 01:58:18,587
It left me alone in a way that...

1128
01:58:18,962 --> 01:58:20,589
I haven't gotten over.

1129
01:58:21,423 --> 01:58:22,883
And right now...

1130
01:58:23,341 --> 01:58:24,426
I'm afraid.

1131
01:58:26,555 --> 01:58:29,349
I'm afraid of walking away again.

1132
01:58:29,641 --> 01:58:32,020
I'm afraid of what I might find.

1133
01:58:33,813 --> 01:58:35,857
But I'm even more afraid of...

1134
01:58:36,649 --> 01:58:38,777
Not facing this fear.

1135
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:41,530
I love you Hunter.

1136
01:58:43,532 --> 01:58:45,869
I love you more than my life.

1137
01:58:57,341 --> 01:58:59,928
- Hey.
- Hey.

1138
01:59:05,851 --> 01:59:07,478
Can I tell you something?

1139
01:59:10,231 --> 01:59:12,609
Sure... Anything you like.

1140
01:59:14,402 --> 01:59:15,779
It's kind of long.

1141
01:59:17,531 --> 01:59:19,158
I have plenty of time.

1142
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,730
I knew these people...

1143
01:59:45,524 --> 01:59:46,608
What people?

1144
01:59:48,652 --> 01:59:50,112
These two people...

1145
01:59:55,910 --> 01:59:57,620
They were in love with each other...

1146
02:00:00,958 --> 02:00:02,376
The girl was...

1147
02:00:02,961 --> 02:00:07,300
Very young, about 17, or 18...
I guess.

1148
02:00:08,718 --> 02:00:10,219
And the guy was...

1149
02:00:10,803 --> 02:00:12,181
Quite a bit older.

1150
02:00:13,807 --> 02:00:16,602
And he was kind of raggedy and wild.

1151
02:00:18,145 --> 02:00:20,023
And she was very beautiful, you know?

1152
02:00:22,817 --> 02:00:23,651
Yeah.

1153
02:00:24,444 --> 02:00:28,407
And together they turned everything
into a kind of an adventure.

1154
02:00:29,867 --> 02:00:31,327
And she liked that.

1155
02:00:32,871 --> 02:00:36,209
Just an ordinary trip
down to the grocery store was...

1156
02:00:36,792 --> 02:00:38,377
Full of adventure.

1157
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:43,258
And they were always laughing
at stupid things...

1158
02:00:43,634 --> 02:00:45,470
He liked to make her laugh.

1159
02:00:47,055 --> 02:00:48,097
And...

1160
02:00:50,308 --> 02:00:52,686
They didn't much care for anything else.

1161
02:00:53,479 --> 02:00:56,899
Cus all they wanted to do
was be with each other.

1162
02:00:58,818 --> 02:01:00,654
They were always together.

1163
02:01:01,446 --> 02:01:03,657
Sounds like they were very happy.

1164
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:08,539
Yes. They were, they were real happy.

1165
02:01:10,123 --> 02:01:11,166
And he...

1166
02:01:11,708 --> 02:01:13,419
Hey loved her more than...

1167
02:01:15,838 --> 02:01:17,715
He ever felt possible.

1168
02:01:21,053 --> 02:01:23,430
He couldn't stand being away from her,

1169
02:01:23,514 --> 02:01:25,767
During the day
when he went to work.

1170
02:01:30,981 --> 02:01:32,483
So he quit.

1171
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:35,903
Just to be home with her.

1172
02:01:36,779 --> 02:01:39,324
And then he'd get another job
when the money ran out...

1173
02:01:41,077 --> 02:01:42,912
And then he'd quit again.

1174
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:46,542
But pretty soon, she started to worry.

1175
02:01:50,963 --> 02:01:53,049
- Bout what?
- Money I guess.

1176
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:55,176
Not having enough.

1177
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:57,804
Not knowing when the next check
was coming in.

1178
02:02:00,266 --> 02:02:02,560
Yeap, I know that feeling.

1179
02:02:03,185 --> 02:02:05,688
So, he started to get kinda...

1180
02:02:06,064 --> 02:02:07,524
Torn inside.

1181
02:02:11,528 --> 02:02:12,739
How do you mean?

1182
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:16,368
Well, he knew he had to work
to support her...

1183
02:02:17,369 --> 02:02:19,789
But he couldn't stand
being away from her either.

1184
02:02:22,125 --> 02:02:23,418
I see.

1185
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:27,089
And the more he was away from her,
the crazier he got.

1186
02:02:28,549 --> 02:02:31,302
Except now, he got really crazy.

1187
02:02:35,057 --> 02:02:37,184
He started imagining all kinds of things.

1188
02:02:39,437 --> 02:02:40,396
Like what?

1189
02:02:42,941 --> 02:02:46,445
He started thinking
she was seeing other men on the sly.

1190
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:50,826
He'd come home from work
and accuse her of...

1191
02:02:51,285 --> 02:02:53,622
Spending the day
with somebody else.

1192
02:02:53,997 --> 02:02:56,500
He'd yell at her
and break things in the trailer.

1193
02:02:59,629 --> 02:03:00,672
The trailer...

1194
02:03:06,219 --> 02:03:07,304
Yes.

1195
02:03:08,806 --> 02:03:10,641
They lived in a trailer home.

1196
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:28,997
Excuse me sir, but were you
in this with me the other day?

1197
02:03:30,498 --> 02:03:31,874
I don't mean to pry...

1198
02:03:34,295 --> 02:03:35,170
No.

1199
02:03:36,964 --> 02:03:37,882
Oh...

1200
02:03:41,970 --> 02:03:44,264
I thought I recognized
your voice for a minute.

1201
02:03:45,682 --> 02:03:46,601
No.

1202
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:49,061
Wasn't me.

1203
02:03:49,729 --> 02:03:50,813
Uh huh...

1204
02:03:54,027 --> 02:03:55,153
Please go on.

1205
02:03:58,406 --> 02:04:01,702
Anyway... He started
to drink real bad.

1206
02:04:02,786 --> 02:04:05,414
He would stay out late to test her.

1207
02:04:07,792 --> 02:04:09,628
What do you mean, test her?

1208
02:04:10,712 --> 02:04:12,547
To see if she would get jealous.

1209
02:04:14,425 --> 02:04:16,510
Ha... uh huh.

1210
02:04:18,971 --> 02:04:22,392
He wanted her to get jealous.
But she didn't.

1211
02:04:22,809 --> 02:04:24,311
She just worried about him,

1212
02:04:25,355 --> 02:04:27,149
But that got him even madder.

1213
02:04:28,943 --> 02:04:30,110
Why?

1214
02:04:31,570 --> 02:04:33,113
Because...

1215
02:04:34,366 --> 02:04:37,202
He thought that if she never got jealous of him
she didn't really care about him.

1216
02:04:39,037 --> 02:04:42,500
Jealousy was a sign of her love for him.

1217
02:04:43,459 --> 02:04:45,127
And then one night,

1218
02:04:46,170 --> 02:04:49,341
One night she told him
that she was pregnant.

1219
02:04:50,259 --> 02:04:52,844
She was about 3 or 4 months pregnant.

1220
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:54,931
And he didn't even know.

1221
02:04:55,640 --> 02:04:57,851
And then suddenly everything would change.

1222
02:04:58,936 --> 02:05:02,023
He stopped drinking,
and got a steady job.

1223
02:05:02,899 --> 02:05:04,859
He was convinced
that she loved him now,

1224
02:05:04,943 --> 02:05:07,113
Because she was carrying his child.

1225
02:05:08,072 --> 02:05:11,826
And he was going to dedicate himself
to making a home for her.

1226
02:05:13,077 --> 02:05:15,163
But a funny thing started to happen.

1227
02:05:15,706 --> 02:05:16,915
What?

1228
02:05:17,499 --> 02:05:19,793
He didn't even notice it at first.

1229
02:05:20,168 --> 02:05:22,130
She started to change.

1230
02:05:22,922 --> 02:05:24,465
From the day the baby was born.

1231
02:05:24,591 --> 02:05:27,219
She began to get irritated
with everything around her.

1232
02:05:27,761 --> 02:05:29,471
She got mad at everything.

1233
02:05:30,724 --> 02:05:33,727
Even the baby seemed
to be injustice to her.

1234
02:05:34,312 --> 02:05:36,939
He kept trying to make everything
alright for her,

1235
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:38,691
Buy her things,

1236
02:05:38,691 --> 02:05:41,028
Take her out to dinner once a week.

1237
02:05:41,737 --> 02:05:43,780
But nothing seemed to satisfy her.

1238
02:05:44,573 --> 02:05:48,036
For two years, he struggled
to pull them back together,

1239
02:05:48,119 --> 02:05:50,496
Like the were when they first met.

1240
02:05:51,748 --> 02:05:55,586
But finally he knew
that it was never going to work out.

1241
02:05:57,713 --> 02:05:59,506
So he hit the bottle again.

1242
02:05:59,882 --> 02:06:02,093
But this time it got mean.

1243
02:06:03,179 --> 02:06:05,348
This time when he came home
late at night,

1244
02:06:05,681 --> 02:06:08,393
She wasn't worried about him,
or jealous.

1245
02:06:09,144 --> 02:06:11,313
She was just enraged.

1246
02:06:12,856 --> 02:06:15,193
She accused him of holding her captive.

1247
02:06:15,527 --> 02:06:17,363
By making her have a baby.

1248
02:06:19,406 --> 02:06:21,701
She told him
that she dreamed about escaping.

1249
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:25,163
That was all she dreamed about... Escape.

1250
02:06:26,373 --> 02:06:29,627
She saw herself at night,
running naked down a highway.

1251
02:06:30,294 --> 02:06:32,171
Running across fields.

1252
02:06:32,546 --> 02:06:34,216
Running down river beds.

1253
02:06:34,633 --> 02:06:35,885
Always running.

1254
02:06:36,344 --> 02:06:38,805
And always when she was
just about to get away...

1255
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:40,473
He would be there.

1256
02:06:41,058 --> 02:06:42,726
He would stop her somehow.

1257
02:06:44,478 --> 02:06:46,397
He would just appear and stop her.

1258
02:06:49,859 --> 02:06:53,488
And when she told him these dreams,
He believed them.

1259
02:06:54,448 --> 02:06:55,866
He knew she had to be stopped,

1260
02:06:56,033 --> 02:06:57,660
Or she would leave him forever.

1261
02:06:58,577 --> 02:07:00,871
So he tied a cow bell to her ankle,

1262
02:07:01,206 --> 02:07:04,167
So he could hear at night
if she tried to get out of bed.

1263
02:07:05,294 --> 02:07:09,008
But she learned how to muffle the bell,
by stuffing a sock into it.

1264
02:07:09,341 --> 02:07:11,802
And inching her way
out of the bed...

1265
02:07:12,386 --> 02:07:13,887
And into the night.

1266
02:07:15,473 --> 02:07:17,350
He caught her one night
when the sock fell out

1267
02:07:17,517 --> 02:07:19,853
And he heard her
trying to run to the high way.

1268
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:24,233
He caught her, dragged her
back to the trailer, and tied her to the stove,

1269
02:07:24,358 --> 02:07:25,901
With his belt.

1270
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:29,156
He just left her there.

1271
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:31,199
And went back to bed.

1272
02:07:32,659 --> 02:07:34,704
And lay there listing to her scream.

1273
02:07:36,414 --> 02:07:38,625
Then he'd listen to his son's scream.

1274
02:07:40,835 --> 02:07:45,342
And he was surprised at himself
because he didn't feel anything anymore.

1275
02:07:47,802 --> 02:07:50,514
All he wanted to do was sleep.

1276
02:07:52,808 --> 02:07:56,813
And for the first time,
he wished he were far away.

1277
02:08:00,776 --> 02:08:04,447
Lost in a deep vast country
where nobody knew him.

1278
02:08:05,698 --> 02:08:07,408
Somewhere without language.

1279
02:08:08,535 --> 02:08:09,870
Or streets.

1280
02:08:11,330 --> 02:08:14,125
And he dreamed about this place
without knowing it's name.

1281
02:08:15,419 --> 02:08:16,796
And when he woke up,

1282
02:08:17,296 --> 02:08:18,714
He was on fire.

1283
02:08:21,677 --> 02:08:24,680
There were blue flames
among the sheets of his bed.

1284
02:08:25,764 --> 02:08:27,599
He ran through the flames,

1285
02:08:28,601 --> 02:08:30,687
Toward the only two people he loved.

1286
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:33,606
But they were gone.

1287
02:08:36,860 --> 02:08:38,195
His arms were burning.

1288
02:08:38,487 --> 02:08:40,406
And he threw himself outside...

1289
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:44,286
And rolled on the wet ground.

1290
02:08:47,331 --> 02:08:48,667
Then he ran.

1291
02:08:50,585 --> 02:08:52,671
He never looked back at the fire.

1292
02:08:55,633 --> 02:08:56,968
He just ran.

1293
02:09:03,726 --> 02:09:05,769
He ran until the sun came up.

1294
02:09:07,646 --> 02:09:09,566
And he couldn't run any further.

1295
02:09:11,901 --> 02:09:13,653
And when the sun went down...

1296
02:09:14,446 --> 02:09:16,115
He ran again.

1297
02:09:22,373 --> 02:09:24,709
For five days he ran like this.

1298
02:09:26,878 --> 02:09:28,922
Until every sign of man...

1299
02:09:31,967 --> 02:09:33,469
Has disappeared.

1300
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:46,234
Travis.

1301
02:10:29,453 --> 02:10:31,122
If you turn the light off in there,

1302
02:10:31,455 --> 02:10:32,957
Would you be able to see me?

1303
02:10:41,091 --> 02:10:42,175
I don't know.

1304
02:10:47,557 --> 02:10:48,975
I never tried.

1305
02:11:08,206 --> 02:11:09,417
Can you see me?

1306
02:11:12,086 --> 02:11:13,379
Yeah.

1307
02:11:14,839 --> 02:11:16,258
Do you recognize me?

1308
02:11:19,219 --> 02:11:20,763
Oh, Travis.

1309
02:11:28,355 --> 02:11:30,399
I brought Hunter with me.

1310
02:11:42,998 --> 02:11:44,333
Don't you want to see him?

1311
02:11:47,503 --> 02:11:48,545
Yeah.

1312
02:11:58,015 --> 02:12:02,311
I wanted to see him so bad
that I didn't even dare imagine him anymore.

1313
02:12:08,569 --> 02:12:11,073
Ann kept sending me pictures of him.

1314
02:12:14,368 --> 02:12:16,329
Until I asked her to stop.

1315
02:12:23,129 --> 02:12:24,547
I couldn't stand...

1316
02:12:25,798 --> 02:12:28,884
The pain of seeing him
grow up and missing it.

1317
02:12:38,147 --> 02:12:40,774
Why didn't you keep him with you, Jane?

1318
02:12:44,195 --> 02:12:45,739
I couldn't, Travis.

1319
02:12:50,411 --> 02:12:52,997
I didn't have what I knew he needed.

1320
02:13:00,047 --> 02:13:03,468
I didn't want to use him
to fill all my emptiness.

1321
02:13:09,184 --> 02:13:10,936
Well he needs you now, Jane.

1322
02:13:11,812 --> 02:13:13,272
And he wants to see you.

1323
02:13:13,689 --> 02:13:14,649
He does?

1324
02:13:18,070 --> 02:13:18,987
Yes.

1325
02:13:24,035 --> 02:13:26,245
He's waiting for you...

1326
02:13:26,788 --> 02:13:27,747
Where?

1327
02:13:31,126 --> 02:13:32,294
Downtown.

1328
02:13:33,754 --> 02:13:34,963
In a hotel.

1329
02:13:37,592 --> 02:13:38,760
The Meridian.

1330
02:13:41,429 --> 02:13:43,432
Room 1520.

1331
02:13:51,234 --> 02:13:52,985
You're not going, are you?

1332
02:14:08,837 --> 02:14:10,673
I can't see you Jane.

1333
02:14:13,217 --> 02:14:14,636
Don't go yet.

1334
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:20,935
Don't go yet.

1335
02:14:39,915 --> 02:14:41,375
I...

1336
02:14:43,962 --> 02:14:47,425
I used to make up long speeches
to you after you left.

1337
02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:54,808
I used to talk to you all the time.

1338
02:14:55,434 --> 02:14:56,977
Even though I was alone.

1339
02:15:01,066 --> 02:15:03,651
I walked around for months
talking to you.

1340
02:15:08,657 --> 02:15:11,411
Now, I don't know what to say.

1341
02:15:15,749 --> 02:15:18,628
It was easier when I just imagined you.

1342
02:15:26,763 --> 02:15:29,307
I even imagined you
talking back to me.

1343
02:15:34,313 --> 02:15:36,691
We'd have long conversations.

1344
02:15:38,694 --> 02:15:40,237
The two of us.

1345
02:15:44,242 --> 02:15:46,828
It was almost like you were there.

1346
02:15:51,208 --> 02:15:52,711
I would hear you.

1347
02:15:53,211 --> 02:15:54,921
I would see you, smell you.

1348
02:15:57,298 --> 02:15:58,926
I could hear your voice.

1349
02:16:02,346 --> 02:16:04,641
Sometimes your voice would wake me up.

1350
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:12,066
It would wake me up in the middle of the night
just like you were there in the room with me.

1351
02:16:20,743 --> 02:16:21,702
Then...

1352
02:16:25,416 --> 02:16:27,460
It slowly faded.

1353
02:16:29,588 --> 02:16:31,632
I couldn't picture you anymore.

1354
02:16:35,803 --> 02:16:39,141
I tried to talk out loud to you
like I used to,

1355
02:16:39,141 --> 02:16:40,934
But there was no one there.

1356
02:16:44,856 --> 02:16:46,775
I couldn't hear you.

1357
02:16:52,573 --> 02:16:53,699
Then...

1358
02:16:59,457 --> 02:17:00,833
I just gave up.

1359
02:17:07,883 --> 02:17:09,510
Everything stopped.

1360
02:17:11,721 --> 02:17:12,764
You.

1361
02:17:17,435 --> 02:17:18,979
Just disappeared.

1362
02:17:25,779 --> 02:17:27,739
Now I'm working here.

1363
02:17:33,539 --> 02:17:35,749
I hear your voice all the time.

1364
02:17:41,965 --> 02:17:43,550
Every man...

1365
02:17:44,592 --> 02:17:46,220
Has your voice.

1366
02:18:05,744 --> 02:18:07,287
I'll tell Hunter...

1367
02:18:08,329 --> 02:18:09,664
That you are coming.

1368
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:15,880
- Travis.
- What?

1369
02:18:20,385 --> 02:18:21,720
I'll be there.

1370
02:18:27,226 --> 02:18:28,102
Good.

1371
02:18:34,026 --> 02:18:36,571
- Meridian hotel...
- Yeah.

1372
02:18:41,410 --> 02:18:42,620
Room...

1373
02:19:57,041 --> 02:19:58,334
Oh, you little...

1374
02:21:34,657 --> 02:21:35,867
Your hair.

1375
02:21:36,325 --> 02:21:37,577
It's wet...
