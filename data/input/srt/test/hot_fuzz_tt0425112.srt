1
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:06,507
- Hello!
- Hello!

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,507
Welcome to Hot Fuzz.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,496
I'm Edgar Wright,
the co-writer and director of Hot Fuzz.

4
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:11,663
And I'm Simon Pegg,
and I play Nicholas Angel,

5
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:13,703
and I am also a co-writer of Hot Fuzz.

6
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:17,496
- You're watching Hot Fuzz from Universal.
- And there's the world.

7
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:22,346
This was an idea
to have the history of police sirens,

8
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:24,782
so Hackenbacker,
who are our amazing dubbing people,

9
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:28,576
came up with, basically,
police sirens through the ages

10
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,135
to take us into the first shot.

11
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:38,498
This was shot... Where was this shot? In...

12
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,418
- It was near City Airport, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,579
It was some kind of abandoned building
that had never been used.

14
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,737
Some people think
this is a Point Blank reference,

15
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:48,978
but the truth is that
it wasn't really written like this.

16
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:53,982
It was just, this location happened to have
an amazing vestibule like this,

17
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:57,980
so we decided it had to be the opening shot,

18
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:01,980
and Jess, our DP, made sure
that we caught it at magic hour.

19
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:04,775
Whammo. How did you do
that thing with the face?

20
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:08,496
'Cause that is the face that...
That is simply the shot replicated, isn't it?

21
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:11,260
Yeah, we put your face from the shot
into your badge,

22
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:13,463
- so on the day, you had a little bit of green...
- I remember.

23
00:01:13,547 --> 00:01:15,777
This is whizzing through
a lot of locations very quickly,

24
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,098
but a lot of this shot
was shot on the first three...

25
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:21,826
We did a little pre-shoot
before we started shooting.

26
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:24,421
- To basically kind of...
- This was Hendon, wasn't it?

27
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:26,577
- That was Gravesend, and this is Hendon.
- That's it.

28
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:30,945
Simpson Hall. This is where
people really get their graduations.

29
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:33,382
There is such a thing
as the Silver Baton of Honour, isn't there?

30
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,344
- Yeah, the Baton of Honour.
- It's true.

31
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:36,496
That was the first shot.

32
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:38,737
No, that was the first shot,
and the other one was afterwards.

33
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:40,021
That's right.

34
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:43,901
But a lot of this montage was done
very early on. That's at Hendon.

35
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:46,865
- I actually did that.
- Yeah, you did do it.

36
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:49,865
The shot of you
with the camera attached inside.

37
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,861
You're so fast.
I'm getting an embolism already.

38
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:57,702
I think I did actually claim to do that
in the other commentary as well,

39
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:00,221
but I just wanted to make sure
everybody knows that I did

40
00:02:00,307 --> 00:02:02,138
by doing blanket commentary coverage.

41
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:04,024
- What, the skid?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:05,376
It was great fun.

43
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:07,617
I'm sure we mentioned this before,
but that's Garth Jennings,

44
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:10,824
the director of Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy and Son of Rambow,

45
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,579
playing the crack addict.

46
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:17,303
We have an agreement
that we appear in each other's films.

47
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,347
- Jackson.
- Peter Jackson there in...

48
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,347
I felt a bit bad that his cameo is so fleeting.

49
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:31,181
He watched it the other day, and I sent him
an e-mail to warn him how short it was

50
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:34,145
and said,
"Think Hitchcock and then think quick.

51
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,666
"Think quickcock. It's a quickcock cameo."

52
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,779
"Think cutting room floor."

53
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:44,302
He e-mailed me afterwards to say
that when he saw how short the bit was...

54
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:47,265
He wound me up by saying
that he walked out of the film

55
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:50,657
and wandered around at a loss
and then came back

56
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:54,144
for the scene with the flowers
on the grave at the end.

57
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:56,377
He walked around for five hours
and came back for the end.

58
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,697
Yeah, and he said,
"Some excellent credits followed."

59
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,459
Isn't there a Sergeant's position
here in London?

60
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,582
Now...

61
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,225
- Can I remain here as a PC?
- No.

62
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,865
We always had this idea,

63
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:07,142
I'm sure we mentioned this
on the Shaun of the Dead commentary,

64
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:09,138
that Martin Freeman was like the other you.

65
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:10,706
Yeah, with more hair.

66
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:14,905
And we wanted to play on that
a little bit more here by having him as...

67
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:19,902
That you're the officer on the street
and he's the pen-pushing college boy.

68
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:22,660
Who took the desk job route...

69
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:24,499
- The desk jockey.
- The desk jockey.

70
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:29,422
We had a number of casting ideas
from the outset,

71
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:32,260
and these first three,

72
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:34,863
very early on,
we wanted to get to play these parts,

73
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:38,462
just because it was
this sort of continual trumping,

74
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:40,219
- if you can forgive the phrase...
- Yeah.

75
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:41,706
That sounds a bit wrong.

76
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:44,347
It sounds like
we got chronic flatulence, but...

77
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,137
It was the idea of literally having
the top brass.

78
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,458
As cameos go, it's a good way

79
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:54,062
of bringing out the big guns,
that they kind of...

80
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:56,980
And what's funny,
when Coogan agreed to do it, he said to me,

81
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,342
"So hang on.
So Martin Freeman is my junior

82
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:00,746
"and Bill Nighy is my senior?"

83
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:03,546
I said, "Yeah."
He goes, "I can live with that."

84
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:05,540
So Coogan.

85
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:07,106
It was...

86
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:09,776
- That's a great frozen smile, that.
- I know.

87
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:12,665
It's also great just having them there for...

88
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:16,342
We had them down for two days,
basically, and shot all of their scenes.

89
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:17,656
Yes, I do.

90
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:20,699
And one of the most exciting things
for me about making this film

91
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:23,426
was having such a great mix
of actors together.

92
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:26,260
There is a lot of stars in it,

93
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:29,976
and the accusation may be
that it's kind of celeb-heavy,

94
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:34,504
but from my point of view, it's like having
the best ensemble you could ever have.

95
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:39,502
Absolutely. We kept getting asked,
in some of the initial interviews,

96
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:43,057
"But how did you get these people?"
and, "Is it some sort of club?"

97
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:46,025
And, you know,
we fought hard to get every actor.

98
00:04:46,107 --> 00:04:47,426
You never just take it for granted

99
00:04:47,507 --> 00:04:49,623
and assume people are gonna do it
'cause they like you.

100
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:53,666
I mean, Bill, we wrote to him and said,

101
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:56,500
"It's not a huge part,
but we really want you to do it

102
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,657
"because it's a significant part."

103
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:01,467
And, you know, everybody...
You don't just get a script and do it

104
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:04,015
because the people that are making it
are your friends.

105
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,177
You do it because it's good, right?

106
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:09,339
Also, better to have a whole cast
of great British actors

107
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,067
than be forced to put
an American actor in the part,

108
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,067
crowbarred in, playing a funny FBI agent.

109
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,067
Which you're sometimes asked to do.

110
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,103
No, absolutely. It does happen a lot.
It's surprising.

111
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:23,339
Bill Nighy had a thing
where he said he read the script

112
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:26,146
and he said, "I'll only do it
if you write me one more joke."

113
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,660
And that was his...

114
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:31,899
- "Of course I can. I'm the Chief Inspector."
- Cue twitch.

115
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:34,097
Now, here, who's this lovely lady?

116
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,461
This lovely Oscar-winning actress,
of which...

117
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:40,137
This is Cate Blanchett,
who, you may or may not know,

118
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:44,140
is playing the part of Janine, uncredited,
which was very nice of her.

119
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:47,981
She came down for the day.
She gave her fee to charity.

120
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,740
And I couldn't help but feel on the set

121
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:55,139
that, by showing only her eyes,
we were only using 8% of her talent.

122
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:58,859
There's 8% of Oscar-winning talent
on show there.

123
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:02,303
You do realise
how much she does use her eyes,

124
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:04,264
because they're very emotive.

125
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:09,177
Absolutely. We were all slightly transfixed
by Blanchett's peepers.

126
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:13,738
Well, I spent an entire day between shooting

127
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:15,943
just sat upstairs chatting.

128
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:19,303
And I've been a huge fan of hers
for a long time,

129
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:21,343
so it was quite a fun day for me.

130
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,497
- And you have a mask fetish, as well.
- I do.

131
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:25,942
- I'm very into masks.
- It was like double Christmas.

132
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:28,018
It's like reverse molestation.

133
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:30,541
I don't know where I'm going with this.

134
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,663
We can edit this out later.

135
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:37,786
But she was absolutely lovely,
and it was a real treat.

136
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:42,224
It was like Jim'll Fix It for me that day.
I got to spend the day with Cate Blanchett.

137
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:44,025
That's Joe Cornish in the background,

138
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:46,575
and earlier on we had Robert Popper
from Look Around You fame.

139
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,704
- And also... Who's with Joe?
- That's Chris Waitt, but that's my voice.

140
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:51,618
I feel awful that I...

141
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:52,901
Because we needed to re-dub it,

142
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:55,376
for speed, I ended up re-dubbing it,
and I felt bad.

143
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:56,980
Chris hasn't stopped crying, has he, since...

144
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:03,976
- Since I re-dubbed him.
- Since he came to the premiere.

145
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:04,982
This is...

146
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:05,982
Who did that shot?
You weren't in the copter, were you?

147
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:06,982
No, the helicopter stuff was all shot
on the same day.

148
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:07,545
We tried to maximise our budget

149
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,980
by shooting all of the helicopter stuff
on the same day.

150
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:12,980
So in one day,
they shot part of the car chase in Hatfield,

151
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:17,141
they shot stuff on London all the way down
to Wells, and then they shot stuff in Wells.

152
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,946
So we really got the maximum
out of one helicopter.

153
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:23,099
Weirdly enough,
they drove the helicopter to Wells, though,

154
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:24,745
on the back of a truck.

155
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,863
Hang on. We haven't talked
about that whole montage.

156
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:27,936
It's gone. It's gone.

157
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:30,495
- This was all done in pre-shoots, right?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:32,498
This was all done
before principal photography.

159
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:37,297
I always liked that idea... I was a big fan
of directors like Jeunet and Caro,

160
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:42,745
who show sequences, storytelling,
in really quick cuts.

161
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,499
There's a lot of people
that I admire like that.

162
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:48,182
Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Darren Aronofsky
have that great thing of...

163
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,781
And Scorsese, obviously.
He's the granddaddy of it.

164
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,620
Some interviewer once asked me,

165
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:57,495
said, "Oh, did you steal all your montages
from Snatch?"

166
00:07:57,587 --> 00:08:01,262
And I said, "No, I stole them
from Martin Scorsese like Guy Ritchie did."

167
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,905
- Fair enough.
- Fair enough.

168
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:07,219
There's a little thing there
where you see the swords on the wall

169
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:09,946
that Bernard eventually uses against Angel
in the final battle.

170
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:12,222
So there's scene setting going on.

171
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:15,379
Yeah, we were very anal
about that kind of stuff, of having little...

172
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:19,904
It's almost like playing a video game
and having those little objects, items,

173
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:23,343
that you can pick up and put back
and are things that are significant for later.

174
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:27,215
And pray, silence, please,
for the queen, Billie Whitelaw.

175
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:29,660
Sir William Whitelaw.

176
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:32,821
Willie Bitelaw, as my wife called her
one day by accident.

177
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:35,705
Billie Whitelaw is amazing.

178
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:39,138
A living legend, as they say.

179
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:44,381
And it was so fun having her on set.

180
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:49,416
And she was constantly threatening
to retire, before and afterwards.

181
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:52,101
Pretty much with every single shot,
she'd be saying,

182
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,223
"Darling, this is my last shot in the movies."

183
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:55,581
And I'd be going, "Don't say that."

184
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,339
- She's hilarious. I love it.
- "Don't say that."

185
00:08:57,427 --> 00:09:01,625
On the making-of documentary,
she says, "I never really enjoyed acting."

186
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,938
And I watch that and I just think,
"But you're one of the greatest actresses

187
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:06,858
"this country's ever produced."

188
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,824
And she said, "I don't like acting."

189
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,626
- The reluctant thesp.
- She is. She's wonderful.

190
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:15,545
I have a great story about her
in Twisted Nerve, but that's for another time.

191
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:17,299
- It's too long for this commentary.
- Different commentary.

192
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:18,502
I can say it on the end credits.

193
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:20,100
The end credits are about five minutes long.

194
00:09:20,187 --> 00:09:22,576
- Remind me about the Billie story.
- Okay.

195
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:25,420
- This is Wells. This is my hometown.
- Here we are.

196
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,623
Well, it's weird. It's a village in the film.

197
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:30,062
It is my hometown,
and yet, technically, it's a city,

198
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:32,058
'cause Wells is the smallest city in England.

199
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:33,466
'Cause of the cathedral, I guess.

200
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:36,937
Only beaten by St David's in Wales,
which I'm sure pisses them off no end.

201
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:38,176
Absolutely.

202
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:41,542
That's in the UK. Look at the hoodies.

203
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,346
Here's XTC on the soundtrack.

204
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:45,702
First appearance of Nicholas Frost.

205
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:48,540
This was the Royal Standard
in Beaconsfield.

206
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:51,063
Didn't they say something
like it was Britain's oldest pub?

207
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:52,660
It is Britain's oldest free house.

208
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:54,465
What does a "free house" mean, exactly?

209
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:56,503
It means that...

210
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:59,340
Do you know, I can't honestly give you
a proper definition right now

211
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:00,462
without sounding like a fool.

212
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:02,663
Guys, anybody listening out there
knows what a free house is,

213
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:04,578
please ring in on the Hot Fuzz phone line.

214
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,066
I think it means, like, a free house.

215
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:10,140
You know, like,
you're able to enter and drink.

216
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:13,697
I think it isn't attached to a brewery,

217
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:16,739
I think, is what a free house is.

218
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:18,226
A lot of pubs, they're attached to breweries.

219
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:20,821
- Shall I shut up?
- You're watching Hot Fuzz.

220
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,905
Okay, we have to do that joke several times.

221
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:23,976
Look out for the...

222
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:26,501
You know what's funny? One of the ADs,
when we were shooting this scene,

223
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:27,815
came up to me and said,

224
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:31,946
"Just wanted to say that the word 'bypass'
is misspelt on the paper."

225
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:33,983
I said, "Oh, yeah.
It's supposed to be like that."

226
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,182
We wanted it to annoy people,

227
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,065
the kind of people who put goofs on IMDb,

228
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:41,822
- to be sitting there in the cinema with a...
- Going, "Ha! I've got them!"

229
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,738
"I've got them now!
They spelled 'bypass' wrong."

230
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:44,896
"Those idiots."

231
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:46,420
I like the joke with the braces.

232
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:47,781
- That's Rory there.
- That's Rory.

233
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:49,858
- And Tom. Tom Strode Walton.
- Tom Strode Walton.

234
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:53,337
We used to call him Red Cloud
'cause of his incredible hair.

235
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:55,657
- There he is.
- He's from my school.

236
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:58,819
We actually did auditions
in the Wells Blue School,

237
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:00,465
which is my old comprehensive.

238
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:04,256
I have to stress that it's a comprehensive,
'cause Blue School sounds very posh,

239
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:07,305
and I am not a posh-o,
contrary to popular belief.

240
00:11:07,787 --> 00:11:08,822
Get out.

241
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:10,302
Here's Rory.

242
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:15,656
Simon was very insistent
that I pitch that up to make it sound higher,

243
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:19,820
which is a very similar joke to Brian
in the second series of Spaced,

244
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:21,420
but a very funny one.

245
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:27,903
Talking of which, there's Julia Deakin,
who's an old friend from Spaced.

246
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,343
Old in that we've known her for a long time,
not that she's old.

247
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:34,180
You're looking super-serious in this scene.
I like it.

248
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:36,303
I've got Marvel eyes, as you used to say.

249
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:39,106
Yeah, I used to give Simon the direction
of saying, "Marvel comics,"

250
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:46,147
meaning, "Do more expressive,
Steve Ditko-style eyebrows."

251
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:47,136
- I was only allowed...
- Like Harry Osborn with his widow's peak.

252
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:50,055
It is Harry Osborn. Or is Norman?
Norman is Green Goblin.

253
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:51,660
- Harry is Hobgoblin.
- Hobgoblin, yeah.

254
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:52,816
James Franco.

255
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:55,626
Now, there's a big clue
as to what's going on in the film.

256
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:57,982
Yeah, we wanted to show...
We wanted to do a lot of...

257
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:01,264
When we were writing this...
We're a big fan of mystery films,

258
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:05,386
things like, obviously, The Wicker Man,
but even things like Chinatown,

259
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:09,142
where there are significant visual details
given to you early on.

260
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:10,421
I mean, lots of films like that,

261
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:12,896
like The Usual Suspects
or like The Last of Sheila.

262
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:15,660
Films which kind of give the game away
early on

263
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:17,499
if you're paying attention.

264
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,823
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

265
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,496
Because we lost the Gabriel thread
from the main film,

266
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:24,861
which we'll talk about,

267
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,665
was there a reason you kept in the "G,"

268
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,466
or just did you keep it in
as a sort of red herring?

269
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,424
Yeah, well, also,
Edward mentions the graffiti,

270
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:35,580
and it comes up with the spray cans
and them rubbing out the signs.

271
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,656
Of course.

272
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:38,855
You start talking about...

273
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:42,542
Basically, you can't fit an anecdote into...
It fits into three scenes.

274
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:45,699
It's like, I look back at the screen
and already we're onto another...

275
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:48,301
Well, it is "fast, funny and furiously paced."

276
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,903
Quote, the Daily Star.

277
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:53,658
I think that was the Observer.

278
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:57,307
You can't go wrong
with a cone on the head.

279
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:58,945
- We've all done it.
- William Bailey.

280
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:01,746
You must've put a cone on your head
at some point when you were a student.

281
00:13:01,827 --> 00:13:03,021
Oh, so many times.

282
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:05,099
I used to think that national cones hotline

283
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:08,623
was especially for students to phone up
so they could rent them.

284
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:10,382
My pen's running out.

285
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:13,584
Bill Bailey is a man
that just exudes funniness.

286
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,786
I love your pen...

287
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,427
- Double-handed pen action?
- Double-handed pen action, like Ash.

288
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,226
But that's a really nice way
into this sequence,

289
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:26,619
which is basically paperwork
shot like a fight sequence.

290
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:30,985
When we were doing research,
a lot of the police said that the only...

291
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,056
We interviewed a lot of police,

292
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:38,696
and they all said that the only part of the job
they'd never seen dramatised

293
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:39,702
was the paperwork.

294
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:40,702
So, having watched Man on Fire
and Domino

295
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:44,865
and seen Tony Scott's amazingly
over-caffeinated flash sequences,

296
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:48,860
I thought it'd be a good thing to do
some hefty form-filling done in that style.

297
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:53,099
I think the population of the British
police service will thank you for that.

298
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:55,226
Stuart Wilson there.

299
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,578
- This is...
- There's Lorraine.

300
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:03,664
This is all shot in the marketplace in Wells
in the day now, which looks beautiful.

301
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:07,464
Kevin and Nick, as we know,
and the first appearance of the man

302
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:10,296
- known as the Daltonator.
- The Daltonator.

303
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:11,976
It's...

304
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:14,745
Oh, yeah, this was the first take,

305
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:16,499
and actually,
it wasn't so brilliantly framed, this,

306
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:18,543
'cause it looked like he was pushing you
out of the frame.

307
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:20,265
And we did a retake,
and then when I watched it back,

308
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:21,382
I thought, "Oh, but isn't that good?

309
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:24,539
"It looks like Simon Skinner
is literally trying to take centre stage

310
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:26,345
"and push Nicholas Angel
out of the picture."

311
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:28,782
What was your story
about having a neon sign

312
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:31,335
- pointing to him, saying, "Bad Guy"?
- Oh, yeah.

313
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:33,782
When you read reviews when people say,

314
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,186
"Oh, the bad guy is so obvious,

315
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:37,223
"you may as well
have a neon sign pointing at him,"

316
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,377
I wanted to literally do that.

317
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,776
I couldn't figure out a way of doing it,
'cause the shot was moving.

318
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,016
I was trying to think about...

319
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,416
In chemists' windows,
you get those cross signs.

320
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:47,418
So, really trying to figure that out.

321
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:49,862
When we were writing this, me and Simon,

322
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:51,346
not only did we immerse ourselves

323
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,383
in watching lots of action
and thriller films again,

324
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:58,746
but also, we read Roger Ebert's
Big Book of Hollywood Clichés,

325
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:00,385
which is amazing.

326
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,344
- Essential reading.
- Essential reading.

327
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:06,545
And we made copious notes
of every single thriller cliché that we could

328
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:08,026
to make sure we could get them in.

329
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,337
So I kind of feel,
especially in the latter half of the film,

330
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:13,419
it starts to play like
"the greatest hits of thriller clichés."

331
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,941
All the things you've heard
before and again.

332
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:20,500
Even stuff like the...
Which, in the dub, you did great,

333
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,899
is the feedback on a mike,
which I think is page one of the cliché book.

334
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:27,217
Feedback on a mike,
somebody waking up in a hotel room

335
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:30,265
and immediately switching their lights on
without any fumbling.

336
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,986
Hearing anyone that speaks into
a microphone in a public place

337
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,456
will automatically incur some feedback.

338
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:36,946
Well, this is a classic cliché.

339
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:41,384
Any superior who appears to be genial
is definitely gonna be a bad one.

340
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:42,741
- Yeah.
- A rotten apple.

341
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:43,862
See Hal Holbrook.

342
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:48,065
- See Hal Holbrook in Magnum Force.
- Magnum Force and...

343
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,344
- The Star Chamber, as well.
- The Star Chamber.

344
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,099
And there's something else
he does it in, as well.

345
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:55,941
Well, when Jim Broadbent read the role,
he said straightaway, he goes,

346
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:58,143
"Oh, this is like the James Cromwell part
in L.A. Confidential."

347
00:15:58,227 --> 00:16:00,821
- We said, "Exactly."
- "Yeah, exactly."

348
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:06,018
Now, Jim approached us
at the BAFTAs in 2004.

349
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:07,502
My favourite line.

350
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:10,306
And said how much he'd enjoyed
Shaun of the Dead

351
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,504
and asked us if we'd consider using him.

352
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:15,543
And it was probably
one of the silliest questions

353
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:16,776
we've ever been asked, really,

354
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,983
for an actor that good to come and say that.

355
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:20,386
We were like, "Of course."

356
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:25,097
And so we went into the writing process
of Hot Fuzz with Jim in mind.

357
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:26,302
Absolutely.

358
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:27,542
There's the hedgehog.

359
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:29,618
- "Riot room."
- Coming back later.

360
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,346
Evidence room.

361
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:36,499
This was all shot in a building in...

362
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:38,179
Where was this?
This was near Bushey, wasn't it?

363
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,700
It was right near Bushey.

364
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:42,540
Yeah. This location was a real pain,
I have to say.

365
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,185
- It looks great.
- A lot of glass, wasn't it?

366
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:46,462
It had a lot of glass and it was really small.

367
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,141
We actually made a lot of this on location.

368
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:52,219
There was actually less stuff in the studio
than Shaun of the Dead,

369
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:55,458
which is great
in that it looks really authentic and real,

370
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:58,257
but it can be a real pain. But it's...

371
00:16:58,347 --> 00:17:01,020
- Here's one of my favourite jokes. I like this.
- That's so funny.

372
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:05,183
I'm surprised... I'm quite pleased
we got away with a 15 on the film,

373
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:08,942
'cause we really pushed it as far
as the C-word and the blood would go.

374
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:11,666
- That's a nice joke for a frame advance.
- Absolutely.

375
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:15,177
Freeze-frame that
and read all the things around Kevin's head.

376
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:16,655
- We really like...
- Samson.

377
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:17,862
Doris Thatcher.

378
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:20,256
- She's our only policewoman.
- She's not a policewoman.

379
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:24,465
Much like Spaced and Shaun,
me and Simon are such big fans

380
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:28,459
of TVshows like The Simpsons
and films like Raising Arizona,

381
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,017
we really tried to make it something that
you can't quite take it all in, in one sitting.

382
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:35,782
So hopefully this is the kind of film
that people will watch more than once

383
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,186
and spot things second time around.

384
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:40,577
- I think in the age of DVD...
- Duh-Vuh-Duh.

385
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:41,656
...of Duh-Vuh-Duh,

386
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,580
you owe it to the audience to make a film
worth watching more than once.

387
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,305
I think it's important,

388
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:47,866
and I think there are certain things
in this film

389
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:49,744
that you won't get until you see it twice,

390
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:53,058
because the punch line
comes before the setup.

391
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:54,500
So when you watch it again,

392
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,340
you have the wherewithal to get it,
do you know what I mean?

393
00:17:57,427 --> 00:17:59,019
It wasn't until the second time
that I watched it

394
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:01,257
that I realised that
that was Edward Woodward.

395
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,336
It's amazing.

396
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,902
- The great Edward Woodward.
- The great Edward Woodward.

397
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:07,865
One of the nice...
Actually, do you know what?

398
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:11,257
It sounds clichéd,
and I think I've maybe even said it too much,

399
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:13,497
but what a great group of people this was.

400
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:16,055
It was a real pleasure to sit round

401
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:19,423
while Edgar was feverishly trying
to set the shots up,

402
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:22,704
for us to sit around
and just chat between setups.

403
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:26,257
The anecdotage was insane.

404
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:30,022
But the thing is,
my only regret of the whole film

405
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:31,222
is that I got half-anecdotes.

406
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:34,424
- I know, you did. You didn't get to hang out.
- It's, you know...

407
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:36,936
Edward Woodward would be
about to tell me an amazing story

408
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:38,301
about Christopher Lee on The Wicker Man,

409
00:18:38,387 --> 00:18:40,343
and then it'd be like,
"Oh, ready for the next shot."

410
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:41,655
And I never got the end of them.

411
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:45,786
I need to do a little tour of Ken Cranham
and Edward Woodward's houses.

412
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:51,100
I think on the commentary that Edward does
with Ken and Paul and Tim,

413
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:53,940
I think you might get a few full anecdotes
in there if you listen in.

414
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:58,100
I think that's...
You can set your TV to Thespevision.

415
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:01,587
Or Thesperama would be audio,
wouldn't it, of course?

416
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,977
They were just up for it.

417
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:08,377
It's important, because we're asking
a lot of them, in some respects,

418
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:12,699
because we wanted them to be
sort of omnipresent a lot of the time.

419
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:15,062
So some days they'd come in
and they'd simply be background.

420
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:18,423
And it's a lot to ask of actors

421
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,226
that are that capable
and that experienced and that renowned

422
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,616
to just set the scene.

423
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:25,220
And I think you handled everybody
really well,

424
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:27,298
'cause they understood
exactly what you wanted them to do.

425
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:29,947
I'd like to apologise to Ken Cranham
and Maria Charles for this scene,

426
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:31,426
because at the end of the scene,

427
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:33,657
when they talk about the farmers
and farmers' mums,

428
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:37,262
you originally saw a shot of Paddy and Rafe
looking at Ken and Maria,

429
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:40,259
and they were basically standing in the back
of Simon's shot for the whole time.

430
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,907
And we did a close-up,
and then it just worked better without it.

431
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:47,299
So, in that particular case,
I owe Ken Cranham a drink. I'm sorry.

432
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,379
I'm sure he'll be very keen
to have that with you

433
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,697
- and discuss your neglect.
- Oh, no. Unfortunately...

434
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:56,018
Ken has the most amazing laugh
of any actor.

435
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,256
It's deep and dirty.

436
00:19:57,347 --> 00:19:59,303
He doubles over when he laughs.

437
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,261
This was a tough scene to do.

438
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:04,383
- One of the first scenes we wrote, as well.
- Yeah, yeah.

439
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,503
I think the Janine scene
was the first scene we wrote, wasn't it?

440
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:08,703
Janine and then maybe
the Arthur Webley scene as well.

441
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:09,822
Yeah.

442
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:12,580
Well, I tried to do a lot of things here.
I really like that kind of thing,

443
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,545
what they call diegetic sound,
of sound that's going on in the scene.

444
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:17,583
The soundtracks, things happening and...

445
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,022
There's lots of nice little things,
not just with the fruit machine,

446
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:23,543
but if you hear back there
when Danny's ears prick up,

447
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:25,106
you hear the cash register
in the background.

448
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:27,018
- I like doing things like that.
- You're great at that.

449
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:29,746
You're the king of scoring
with the fruit machine, I've got to say.

450
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:31,385
There's some classic moments in this
with that.

451
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:34,265
Fruit machines, cash registers, it's all good.

452
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:38,778
- I love all of that stuff.
- The stuff with the farmers' mums is...

453
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,016
Oh, yeah, there's...

454
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:42,102
No, I like all that.

455
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:45,816
I think I've probably had my lot
of fruit machines after this one, though.

456
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,067
- I'm gonna move on.
- I think it's a layer of detail

457
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,067
that you don't always see,

458
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:56,264
and that's one thing, I think,
that's good about being a writer-director,

459
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:57,780
is that you are, you know...

460
00:20:57,867 --> 00:21:01,462
And because you're so present in the edit
with Chris, as well,

461
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:05,062
you get to intercede
at every single level of the film.

462
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:07,342
Do you know what I mean?
You're stamped all over it.

463
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:10,100
Well, the thing is,
when we make these films...

464
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:13,304
If you ever read the screenplays to the films,
they've got all the lines,

465
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:15,742
but there's very little detail
in the stage directions,

466
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:17,624
mainly because it's just too long.

467
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:20,380
And so it's great
when you're editing and dubbing,

468
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,185
'cause you can add so many other layers,

469
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:25,339
either new ideas that you had
or ideas that you've had for ages,

470
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:27,383
and it's like it all comes together at the end.

471
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:30,379
We actually skimp on stage directions
in order to fit more dialogue in

472
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:32,139
- and get the page count down.
- I know.

473
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:34,422
The kind of things that we do
to get the page count down.

474
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:35,576
Little writer's cheats.

475
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:36,702
I don't think there's a single writer

476
00:21:36,787 --> 00:21:39,062
that hasn't changed the formatting
to make it seem shorter.

477
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:40,500
I know.

478
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:44,936
What an amazing, amazing buffet of talent
in this scene.

479
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:46,460
- Anne Reid.
- Oh, get on.

480
00:21:46,547 --> 00:21:47,821
The Whitelaw.

481
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:51,616
I think all of the boys
have a crush on Anne Reid, don't they?

482
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:53,266
She's absolutely lovely.

483
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:56,783
Lest we forget, she's had Bond in her time.

484
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,619
She did have a little bit of a tryst with Bond.

485
00:21:58,707 --> 00:22:00,584
I must stress that
that's in the film The Mother,

486
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,056
- the Roger Michell film, and not in real life.
- Yes.

487
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,136
Well...

488
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:06,741
Do you know what I heard
from Roger Michell the other day?

489
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,624
- He saw the film and really loved it.
- Oh, really?

490
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:13,144
'Cause he sees Anna Maxwell Martin,
if I can say that,

491
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:15,536
- and they both saw it and really liked it.
- Good.

492
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:19,097
Personal information,
broadcast to the world.

493
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:20,785
- I love...
- Stuart Wilson here.

494
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:22,346
Paul Freeman, Ken Cranham.

495
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:24,861
There's a second-viewing thing,
is Jim in this scene, I think,

496
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:26,539
when you watch it knowing he's bad.

497
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:28,618
- Particularly in that shot.
- Yeah, yeah.

498
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:32,985
What we really wanted to do with the NWA

499
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:36,537
was not only cast British institutions,

500
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:39,585
amazing actors and character actors,

501
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,101
but also, there was an idea
that a lot of these people

502
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:44,747
have essayed great baddies in their time.

503
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:49,145
And we really wanted that idea
that you would watch the film and think,

504
00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:53,698
"Oh, there's a lot of significant actors
playing these seemingly insignificant parts,"

505
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,459
and for it to seem slightly suspect.

506
00:22:55,547 --> 00:23:00,940
And so, if you're a film fan,
you can definitely spot straightaway that...

507
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,024
Well, Stuart Wilson
can't be just playing a doctor,

508
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:04,984
and Billie Whitelaw
can't just be playing a hotelier.

509
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,386
And Anne Reid can't not have any lines.

510
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:08,742
And, of course,
she has all the lines in that one scene.

511
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:10,658
So we really wanted to have this thing

512
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:14,262
where it felt like
a really winning hand of baddies.

513
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:17,225
- Look at those pecs.
- Nice.

514
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:21,744
They're very much inspired
by things like Murder on the Orient Express,

515
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:25,740
where you have
a star-studded cast of potential suspects.

516
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,627
Which I think you're...
Yeah, what you said about...

517
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,460
It's actually an aid to understanding,
as well.

518
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:34,141
Yeah, I think when you watch
a lot of those film noir films

519
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:36,343
and mysteries and stuff,

520
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:40,625
anything from The Big Sleep
to, I don't know, Oliver Stone's JFK,

521
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:44,177
you have very famous people playing
small parts so that you could follow it.

522
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,586
Yeah, exactly.

523
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:47,983
That was Johnny Borrell, wasn't it,
there behind me?

524
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,217
Johnny... It does look like him.

525
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:51,979
It does, doesn't it?

526
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:55,340
I think all of Razorlight
are in there somewhere.

527
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:58,342
Now, I just wanted, before we move on...

528
00:23:58,427 --> 00:24:00,383
I was really pleased with,
"Have you got it in you?"

529
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:02,378
'cause it was just a slightly inappropriate...

530
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:05,106
- Yes, no good for a school.
- For a school, no.

531
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:07,621
That would not go down well
in the current climate.

532
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,857
No. No.

533
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,939
I love this piece of music.
This is a rarity that you found, isn't it?

534
00:24:15,027 --> 00:24:16,779
Oh, it's on that album, Velvet Tinmine.

535
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:19,381
There's an album
of glam rock no-hit wonders.

536
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:20,661
And when we were writing...

537
00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:23,261
A lot of the time,
a lot of the music that we use in the film

538
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:25,463
is stuff that we were listening to
whilst we were writing,

539
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,663
and I think this one came up
on my iPod Shuffle.

540
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:30,864
And there's something
about the glitter-stomp-glam rock thing

541
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:33,142
that really goes with policemen
plodding along.

542
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:37,345
Do you think it's because of the siren
at the beginning of Blockbuster

543
00:24:37,427 --> 00:24:39,019
that makes that connection?

544
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:42,338
There's definitely that, but I also think,
weirdly, that that kind of pace,

545
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:44,065
it seems intrinsically British,
of lolloping along.

546
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:50,307
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah, it's true, it's true.

547
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:51,307
- It's like the beginning of The Bill, kind of.
- Absolutely.

548
00:24:51,307 --> 00:24:54,982
Stephen Merchant, Adam Buxton,
we've both seen there, and also...

549
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:57,865
This bit, that's one of my main regrets
for this film, is that...

550
00:24:57,947 --> 00:25:02,896
We did a couple of re-shoots,
and we had a killer idea for that swan joke.

551
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:06,024
And it's one of my few regrets about this
that we didn't get to shoot it.

552
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:09,497
- We tried, didn't we?
- It was going to be a woofer.

553
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:11,623
Then Nick grew a beard
and he couldn't shave it off

554
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:13,106
- 'cause he had to do Hyperdrive.
- I know, Nick...

555
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:16,259
- Yeah. Oh, well.
- Should we say what it was?

556
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:17,860
It was just going to be a series of honks.

557
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:20,984
It was going to be Danny and Angel
honking in time.

558
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:24,184
Also, Angel finally succumbing
and trying a honk.

559
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,537
This bit here is a nod to those urban films

560
00:25:30,627 --> 00:25:32,219
like Training Day, like...

561
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:36,459
If you look at something like Training Day
or S.W.A.T.

562
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:40,222
or those kind of films
where they have the slow-motion shots

563
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,457
- of potential perps.
- Yeah.

564
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:44,902
And this also came from the research,
is that...

565
00:25:44,987 --> 00:25:48,104
We got a lot of things out of,
particularly the Met cops in the city...

566
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:49,620
- Street smarts.
- Street smarts.

567
00:25:49,707 --> 00:25:53,017
Things like people wearing hot coats
on warm days,

568
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:55,302
clearly concealing weapons or drug dealers.

569
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,786
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's all true.

570
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,186
Groups of three people.

571
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:01,976
When we were on patrol in Lambeth,
the officer that took us out

572
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:04,456
showed us all sorts of things
that were going down

573
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:06,902
that you wouldn't really spot
unless you knew what was happening.

574
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:09,547
Yeah, we'd be going past the Tube station
and he'd say,

575
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:11,902
"Three guys outside, two in the front,
one in the back.

576
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,262
"Two in the front are taking the money,
one behind's got the drugs."

577
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:15,985
I don't know why I'm doing
a Somerset accent,

578
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:18,900
'cause he was from Brixton.
I'm sorry, I'm getting all confused.

579
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:20,386
Here we are in Hounslow.

580
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:23,584
Yeah, this was not the Somerfield's in Wells.

581
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:28,058
This was an empty Safeway in Hounslow,
which we redid as a Somerfield's.

582
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:29,705
There's me. That's my tiny cameo.

583
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:31,618
Was that you?
I didn't even know that was you.

584
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:34,221
I used to be a shelf stacker at Somerfield's,

585
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:36,582
and when I did my little cameo
as a shelf stacker,

586
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,783
I wore my uniform for the rest of the day,
if you remember.

587
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,016
I do remember that.

588
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:42,063
- Of course.
- I felt very comfortable.

589
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:44,786
You seemed too comfortable.
You had a little tie on as well, I remember.

590
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,459
Well, it was a nod to...
Tarantino does that thing

591
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:49,220
of wearing the costume
specific to the scene.

592
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,026
I never felt more at ease as I was
back in my shelf stacking uniform.

593
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:54,098
Listen, you know your place, mate.
That's the main thing.

594
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:55,506
- I know.
- You gotta get back there,

595
00:26:55,587 --> 00:26:56,622
to Gateway, as it was then.

596
00:26:56,707 --> 00:26:59,938
I think I'll do a couple of films
then will be going back there.

597
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:03,739
- Look at him. Look at him work.
- I know. I love that.

598
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:05,816
He looks so regal.

599
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:07,659
Tina Richardson, our assistant editor,

600
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:09,977
when she was digitising in the rushes,
she said,

601
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:12,900
"Timothy Dalton looks like a cartoon fox."

602
00:27:13,747 --> 00:27:16,215
He's like Foxy out of Foxy Bingo.

603
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:21,019
Do you remember
we had that little argumentative discussion

604
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,745
about whether or not
I should have my hat on?

605
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:26,979
Because it was like this little collision
of what was cool and what was real,

606
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:29,422
- do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. But I think it's a good...

607
00:27:29,507 --> 00:27:31,145
And we compromised quite well, I thought.

608
00:27:31,227 --> 00:27:34,742
Presumably...
What do police officers do in foot chases?

609
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:41,656
You can't run along with your helmet on
or your cap.

610
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:42,662
Maybe they just carry it.

611
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:43,662
How many times did I do that
to get that skid?

612
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,305
- It's on the outtakes.
- Of course.

613
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:49,626
They put K-Y Jelly on the floor
to make it able for me to skid,

614
00:27:49,707 --> 00:27:53,700
and it was also slightly false footing.
Pardon the pun.

615
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:56,423
You can't go wrong with Supercop,

616
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:59,579
which Jackie Chan fans will know
as Police Story III.

617
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:02,545
Now, who was our friend there
in the Shopmobility with the dog?

618
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:03,946
Malcolm and Jock.

619
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:06,063
- And Jock the dog.
- He managed to get in a lot of shots.

620
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:07,216
There's Graham Low.

621
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:10,219
He's an old friend of mine from school
who was in a lot of my amateur films.

622
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:11,342
Tosser!

623
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:13,383
- Does he say "tosser"?
- He does say "tosser," yeah.

624
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:15,662
I got him to do that in ADR.

625
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:17,146
This was great, shooting this.

626
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:21,379
This is the high street in Wells,
and this is where I used to walk to school.

627
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,539
This is how I used to walk to school,
down this thing, down this little alley.

628
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:26,185
But not running like that.

629
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:31,182
This is called Lovers Walk, believe it or not,
and believe it or not even more,

630
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:33,417
that is where I had my first kiss,
down that alley.

631
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:35,225
- With me.
- With you.

632
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:37,298
Now, this is a joke you wrote
a long time ago, isn't it?

633
00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:40,379
It is. I wrote this joke for another film
and I always thought it was a good one,

634
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,583
a film that never got made
about a pub crawl.

635
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:45,101
I always thought..."You mothers."

636
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:47,781
That's kind of like
a Raiders of the Lost Ark-type shot.

637
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:49,619
Yeah, the running up to the camera.

638
00:28:49,707 --> 00:28:51,425
With the scene with Marion in the basket.

639
00:28:51,507 --> 00:28:53,782
Here's our little callback
to Shaun of the Dead.

640
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:56,461
And Simon...

641
00:28:56,547 --> 00:28:57,821
- Not Simon.
- Not Simon.

642
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:00,378
- I can't do that.
- That's still pretty...

643
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:01,741
It's a great changeover.

644
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,055
That is Nick, though.

645
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:07,299
I asked Nick to look behind here
so he could take the lap of victory.

646
00:29:07,387 --> 00:29:10,026
He said, "Well, why would I look behind?
Shouldn't I keep on running?"

647
00:29:10,107 --> 00:29:11,256
I said, "If you don't turn round,

648
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:12,826
"nobody will know it's you that's done it."

649
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:16,024
- Batman.
- Batman Begins sound effect there.

650
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:19,338
Now, Marcus Carter,
who gets a mention later in the film,

651
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:22,942
who's an old friend of my brother,
this is outside his house, as I realised.

652
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,062
He e-mailed me the other day

653
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:25,865
to say he was looking forward
to seeing the film.

654
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:29,064
- There's Elvis, the swan.
- Man.

655
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:31,217
This is Gabriel and the hoodies.

656
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:32,535
Gabriel Weaver.

657
00:29:32,627 --> 00:29:36,586
There was a whole thread
about the fact that Gabriel Weaver,

658
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,861
who is the head of the hoodies,

659
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:41,735
is the grandson of
Edward Woodward's character, Tom Weaver.

660
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,783
We were really running out of time
shooting this scene,

661
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,177
and the sun was going down.
It was quite tense.

662
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:49,576
I wish we'd have taken his cap off, actually.

663
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,020
It would have made so much more sense

664
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:53,416
for you to have whipped his cap off
at the start of the shot.

665
00:29:53,507 --> 00:29:57,659
One of those annoying things
that at the end of the day, I go, "Oh, no!"

666
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:00,585
More Jon Spencer on the soundtrack.

667
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:04,501
Ben McKay, there,
is playing a very sheepish felon,

668
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:06,066
but he's actually a very nice guy.

669
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:07,580
I like the fact
he's always got his tongue out.

670
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:08,782
He has.

671
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,346
What do you mean,
he doesn't wanna press charges?

672
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:14,978
Your reaction shot here is gold.

673
00:30:15,067 --> 00:30:17,501
I love that. It's like a triple take.

674
00:30:17,587 --> 00:30:19,896
It's like he appeared out of nowhere.
That's why I like it so much.

675
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:21,340
Like he appeared in a puff of smoke.

676
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:25,898
Well, this is the thing. Simon Skinner,
the inspiration for that character is...

677
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:29,024
I used to work at the Somerfield's,
and my boss, who was absolutely lovely,

678
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:31,860
and sadly no longer with us, he...

679
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:34,859
- Who we initially named the character after.
- Yeah, yeah. He's Mr Stockwell.

680
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:36,824
His name was Mike Stockwell.
He was a lovely, lovely guy.

681
00:30:36,907 --> 00:30:38,579
And he was really...

682
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,100
I used to really admire him

683
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:42,337
'cause he held himself
like the mayor of the town.

684
00:30:42,427 --> 00:30:44,463
He was the manager of the Somerfield's,
and yet...

685
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:46,299
So he didn't look a lot like Dalton,

686
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:49,265
but I like the idea of, like,
Dalton was really...

687
00:30:49,507 --> 00:30:51,225
You know, he's like the king of the town.

688
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,376
He can walk in anywhere.

689
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,856
He can just walk into the custody suite
as he wishes.

690
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:57,381
- Yeah, exactly. He's got full access.
- Yeah.

691
00:30:57,467 --> 00:31:03,178
I must just mention, going back a little bit
to the scene in the supermarket,

692
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:07,260
we watched Get Carter
as part of our research,

693
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:10,384
- and that scene is directly a homage.
- Oh, yeah, with John Osborne

694
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:11,946
- and his gangster's moll.
- Yeah.

695
00:31:12,027 --> 00:31:15,542
We really liked the fact that John Osborne,
who plays Mr Big in Get Carter,

696
00:31:15,627 --> 00:31:18,061
has a moll sitting on the edge of his sofa.

697
00:31:18,147 --> 00:31:20,786
So that's what Alice Lowe was playing,
the Somerfield moll.

698
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:23,779
That said, you would get check-out girls
who would loll around,

699
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:26,017
- and the assistant manager.
- Really?

700
00:31:26,107 --> 00:31:28,098
- And Alice Lowe, as well...
- Maybe eating some biscuits

701
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,257
- that have gone out of...
- Some damaged biscuits?

702
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,826
Some damaged biscuits.

703
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:34,375
Alice Lowe is great as Tina, the shop girl.

704
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:36,935
She doesn't say much,
but she's got that look of disdain,

705
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:38,255
which she carries off so brilliantly.

706
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:40,986
And I don't want to be sexist,
but Alice has amazing pins.

707
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,182
You sexist.

708
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:43,942
What's that noise? That...

709
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,222
- Is that their speeding thing?
- That's the speed gun thing.

710
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:49,777
- The shortest car chase ever.
- David Threlfall.

711
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:51,825
- This...
- What a guy.

712
00:31:52,547 --> 00:31:54,139
Look at his gloves.

713
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:57,939
He really... I think this look was his...

714
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,779
He had to have longer hair for another part,

715
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:03,143
and at first I thought that, as a solicitor,
he should have shorter hair,

716
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:06,424
but he said, "No, I should be rakish.
I should be a bit of a ponce."

717
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,576
And I said, "You're right."

718
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:11,660
So he came up with the cardigan look,
and the hair is just brilliant.

719
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:14,386
He's very funny, as well.
He was a hoot to work with,

720
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:19,416
'cause he used to make me laugh
during takes.

721
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:22,305
Not on purpose,
just because he was just very funny.

722
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:25,265
Lucy Punch is doing a lot of business
in the back of shot.

723
00:32:25,347 --> 00:32:26,905
- Yeah, it's great. Yeah.
- She's twirling her hair.

724
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,706
She's really trying to distract the eye,
and it's working.

725
00:32:29,787 --> 00:32:30,856
She's being bored.

726
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:33,017
Yeah, she's trying to use
her feminine wiles on Angel,

727
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:34,904
- who's not having any of it.
- And the audience.

728
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,455
And thinking,
"How can I upstage Threlfall in the shot?

729
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:39,185
"I'll twiddle my hair and look cute."

730
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:43,306
There's a great line that David does
in the am dram, which is actually cut out,

731
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:45,823
when Skinner asks where his wife is

732
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:47,499
and he says,
"Oh, she's at home with the dogs."

733
00:32:47,587 --> 00:32:50,943
- "She's at home with the dogs."
- It was a great way that he delivered it.

734
00:32:51,027 --> 00:32:53,416
This...

735
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:58,105
For some reason, shooting in this lay-by

736
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:00,064
- was really lousy, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

737
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,103
I think we had
a lot of weather problems this day,

738
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:03,506
and it felt like...

739
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:05,896
We were all in a pretty foul mood.
I was as well.

740
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:08,899
- And Nick and I, in the actors' commentary...
- Look, that's my hands.

741
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,102
Oh, yeah.

742
00:33:10,187 --> 00:33:12,143
That's Oscar's amazing flick book.

743
00:33:12,227 --> 00:33:14,866
Me and Oscar,
when we were both at the Blue School,

744
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:17,461
we used to do flick books
in people's homework diaries

745
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:18,980
and sell them for a quid each.

746
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,137
You're both very adept artists,

747
00:33:22,387 --> 00:33:25,459
obviously, Oscar particularly,
but you're both good at drawing.

748
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:29,859
Oscar used to do
endless stick-man violence flick books.

749
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:33,982
All of his flick books would be
stick men drawn with black ink

750
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,023
- but with red biro blood.
- Nice.

751
00:33:36,107 --> 00:33:38,143
So it'd just be constant stick-man violence.

752
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:43,426
Well, I mean, if you have the double disc,
go to the flick book extra overleaf.

753
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:45,304
Absolutely, yes.

754
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:47,617
Nick said that that was twatty of Angel,
to do that.

755
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:48,856
I like the fact that he's twatty.

756
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:51,256
- I kind of like the fact that...
- He is a bit of a twat.

757
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:52,746
I like the fact that he's a bit unlikeable.

758
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:56,024
'Cause it's like, you've got to be
a bit frozen to melt later on.

759
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:58,826
- Exactly. He needs to be redeemed.
- I know.

760
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:06,536
That became Danny's signature tic,
was his...

761
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,542
- His chimp laugh.
- Yeah.

762
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,542
Oh, I like this bit.
This went through various stages.

763
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:09,463
Originally it was Guys and Dolls
in the script,

764
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,266
and then we couldn't clear Guys and Dolls
'cause it was too expensive,

765
00:34:12,347 --> 00:34:13,860
and we thought about Romeo and Juliet

766
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:17,542
'cause it obviously had a bearing on the fact
that Martin and Eve were having an affair.

767
00:34:17,627 --> 00:34:21,142
And then it came up,
the idea of doing the Baz Luhrmann thing,

768
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:25,584
and then almost as quickly,
the idea of doing the Cardigans song,

769
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:29,296
which Jonathan Whitehead,
who does a lot of music for Chris Morris,

770
00:34:29,387 --> 00:34:31,901
did the rendition of it, the cockney...

771
00:34:32,787 --> 00:34:33,981
- Hilarious.
- Which is brilliant.

772
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:37,025
And also, obviously,
the costumes was one of the first things,

773
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:41,305
having them continually in the costumes
that you remember them from the film.

774
00:34:41,387 --> 00:34:44,743
Yeah, it's the idea... Yeah, they keep
the fancy-dress costumes on.

775
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:47,819
The other thing I like
is when David Threlfall goes to the bar,

776
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:49,579
- he's still got his makeup on.
- Yeah.

777
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,737
It's like he's so vain
that he'd be in the dressing room

778
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:53,897
and he'd go, "Oh, I look fine. It looks fine."

779
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:56,501
- He'd rush out to meet his public.
- Absolutely.

780
00:34:56,787 --> 00:34:59,096
Another hefty transition there with some...

781
00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:02,543
We liked the idea of the cranberry juice
in extreme close-up,

782
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:05,095
is the idea that blood is about to be spilt.

783
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,542
- That's why it's all red.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

784
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:11,097
- Red for impending doom.
- Splashing into the cup.

785
00:35:11,547 --> 00:35:15,938
Also, the Romeo and Juliet thing
panned out really well, because when...

786
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:18,661
I remember reading the play

787
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:22,183
to find out what Skinner could say to Angel

788
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:24,337
when he appears at the scene,

789
00:35:24,427 --> 00:35:27,146
and there's that great quote about,
"Never was there more woe..."

790
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:29,502
- Yeah, yeah.
- And it seemed to fit so perfectly.

791
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:32,226
Just to go back to Greg and Sheree there,
the thing about Straw Dogs,

792
00:35:32,307 --> 00:35:35,060
being an extra in Straw Dogs,
is my brother's girlfriend, Nic,

793
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:37,820
she lives very close to the village
where they shot Straw Dogs,

794
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:41,502
and it always used to amuse me
that the people in the village in Cornwall

795
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:44,784
had fond memories of the shoot,

796
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:47,779
saying about, "Oh, you remember when
they did the Warner Brothers film here

797
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:48,936
"with Dustin Hoffman?"

798
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:51,621
And I think that film could not be nastier
about the area,

799
00:35:51,707 --> 00:35:53,379
and yet everybody remembers it
with such fondness.

800
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:57,062
- And also, Dan Channing-Williams...
- Our third AD.

801
00:35:57,147 --> 00:36:01,140
His girlfriend's mum at the time
was an extra in Straw Dogs.

802
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:02,826
There was somebody on the shoot

803
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:05,296
who knew somebody
who was an extra in Straw Dogs.

804
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:07,901
Greg and Sheree,
Trevor Nichols and Elizabeth Elvin,

805
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:09,705
- who played our stand-ins.
- Fantastic stuff.

806
00:36:09,787 --> 00:36:11,061
And if you look carefully, you can see them

807
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:12,865
on a poster for Romeo and Juliet later on,

808
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:14,062
which I thought was a lovely touch.

809
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:16,945
Yeah, it's outside the newsagent
in the final scene.

810
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:19,304
This...

811
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:21,863
Now, this comes from a real anecdote.

812
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:24,939
I won't mention the names,
but my brother came home from school

813
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:27,302
when I was about eight
with some scurrilous gossip.

814
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:30,220
There was some gossip going around
the playground at the primary school

815
00:36:30,307 --> 00:36:34,141
- that so-and-so had fingered so-and-so...
- No!

816
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:36,502
...up by the frog pond.
It wasn't the duck pond.

817
00:36:36,587 --> 00:36:37,815
By the frog pond.

818
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:41,786
Now, I went home that night,

819
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,461
and when my mum and dad said,
"What happened at school today?"

820
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:46,936
I repeated back,
without knowing what it meant,

821
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,666
"So-and-so fingered so-and-so
up the frog pond,"

822
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:51,658
and my brother nearly spat out his tea.

823
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:53,226
I had no idea what fingered meant.

824
00:36:53,307 --> 00:36:54,820
And what did Lesley and Chris make of it?

825
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:57,660
They went a bit white.
I didn't know what fingered meant.

826
00:36:57,747 --> 00:36:59,419
I knew what a frog pond was.

827
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:02,305
I knew what a frog pond...
That's a different sexual practice.

828
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,504
I don't know why we said duck pond
instead of frog pond.

829
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:08,055
- Both sounds equally foul.
- It does.

830
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:10,898
- This is...
- I got frog-ponded at the weekend.

831
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:13,182
I love the fact that...

832
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:15,423
You don't really have stage doors
with red lights.

833
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:20,820
- No.
- I like the artistic licence of having...

834
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:25,298
I do like it when some people have
some kind of unfavourable thing

835
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:27,821
to say about the film,
they say, "It's just really unrealistic."

836
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:30,296
It's like,
"Yeah, there's a killer standing in plain sight

837
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:31,263
- "under a red light."
- I know.

838
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,663
Which is entirely for dramatic effect.

839
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:35,339
Oh, back there,
there's a nice thing that I like.

840
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:36,701
If you watch back in that scene,

841
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,096
in the shot where David and Lucy
are looking at the door,

842
00:37:39,187 --> 00:37:40,745
you see a mannequin which is...

843
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:42,738
You know,
obviously a mannequin has no head.

844
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,705
So it's kind of supposed to foreshadow
the decapitated heads.

845
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:48,017
And also, everybody that dies...

846
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:51,065
- Predicts their own fate.
...predicts their own fate.

847
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:55,823
Blower says, "We haven't got long,"
and Leslie says, "I'm just about to pop off."

848
00:37:55,907 --> 00:38:00,935
And Skinner says about Ron,
"He'll be in bits in the morning."

849
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:02,426
- And...
- And "splat the rat."

850
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:04,498
- Yeah, "splat the rat" for Messenger.
- Yeah.

851
00:38:04,587 --> 00:38:05,861
I like that. I always like...

852
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:08,507
I don't know whether people gather that
when they watch a film.

853
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:11,226
- And, "Tim, your number's up," as well.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

854
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:14,026
- I particularly like, "We haven't got long."
- Yeah.

855
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:15,426
Sergeant Angel?

856
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:19,184
This is the idea that you kind of...

857
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:20,382
It was weird, actually.

858
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,981
I always thought that I should've
directed you differently there,

859
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,864
that you should have
answered straightaway,

860
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:26,585
that you're not caught up in your thoughts.

861
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,544
I should have saved that one
for the next time it happens.

862
00:38:28,627 --> 00:38:29,662
Yeah, 'cause the next time,

863
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,100
- I'm slightly hung over.
- Hung over. I know.

864
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:33,223
Maybe there was a slight confusion
between the two.

865
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:34,865
Yeah, I really screwed up.

866
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:36,778
I can't believe
you messed this film up like that.

867
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:38,823
Really. It's all my fault.

868
00:38:38,907 --> 00:38:41,819
Interesting to note
just how quickly the police service evolves.

869
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:44,102
The radios that we're using there,

870
00:38:44,187 --> 00:38:46,337
by the time the film came out,
were already...

871
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:47,826
The police were already using...

872
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:49,818
In fact, I think they were using it
while we were filming,

873
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:52,262
the sort of mobile-phone radios
which they do now.

874
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:54,986
Now, the Romeo and Juliet joke
didn't come up until editing.

875
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:58,696
That joke with Romeo and Juliet
and the fire came later,

876
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:02,063
and the truth was,
there was no other song that fit the bill

877
00:39:02,147 --> 00:39:05,139
more perfectly than Mark Knopfler
singing here.

878
00:39:05,227 --> 00:39:07,263
And we thought it was good karma,

879
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:10,225
after slating Dire Straits
in Shaun of the Dead,

880
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,537
that we should actually pay
for one of their tracks.

881
00:39:12,627 --> 00:39:15,346
You didn't tell me that you'd done that
until I saw it,

882
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:17,987
and I thought it was really funny
'cause it was a surprise.

883
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,341
But don't do that again.

884
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:22,626
I love that shot.

885
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:24,265
The lighting in your side shot...

886
00:39:24,347 --> 00:39:25,939
"If you were a bit of chocolate,
you'd eat yourself."

887
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:27,858
...is amazing.

888
00:39:28,307 --> 00:39:30,104
Jess Hall.
We gotta say something about Jess Hall.

889
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:32,064
Jess Hall... Well, everybody on the crew,

890
00:39:32,147 --> 00:39:34,581
Jess Hall, Marcus Rowland,
our production designer,

891
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:38,706
Ben Gladstone, the location manager,
amazing stuff.

892
00:39:38,787 --> 00:39:43,417
What I love in this scene is the fact that
the Andes' day planner is completely bare.

893
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,020
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thursday, Friday,

894
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:46,222
Saturday, Sunday, nothing.

895
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:47,820
Nothing behind, either.

896
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:50,057
When we were writing the characters,

897
00:39:50,147 --> 00:39:53,344
we always had this idea
that they played at being detectives

898
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:54,860
'cause they never really had anything to do,

899
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:57,745
which is why they threw themselves
so wholeheartedly into the role,

900
00:39:57,827 --> 00:40:00,500
in terms of what they wore,
their tashes, you know.

901
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:02,305
Yeah, it feels like they're in fancy dress.

902
00:40:02,387 --> 00:40:06,585
It feels like they've got some police outfits
out of their granddad's trunk

903
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:09,221
and they're just playing police detectives
for the day.

904
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:12,697
That's a great reaction there,
when Angel actually says something like,

905
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:14,778
"Why wouldn't they have tried
to apply the brakes?"

906
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:17,301
and it comes to them,
and they're like, "Huh?"

907
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:21,182
I like the thing as well, all the way through
in Bill Bailey's scenes and with the Andes,

908
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:26,546
is the idea of using a phone
to soundtrack deadpan shots.

909
00:40:33,187 --> 00:40:34,176
You know, it cuts to the reaction shots,
you just hear a solitary phone going.

910
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:35,182
You also notice
in the Sandford police station

911
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:36,182
that there's always just one phone ringing,

912
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:37,182
whereas in the Met
there's hundreds ringing.

913
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,182
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

914
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,182
Was this the first day
of principal photography?

915
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:40,216
First day of the proper shoot, yeah.

916
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:42,861
- And it was fucking freezing.
- It was terribly cold.

917
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:44,096
- It was.
- You can tell. It was so...

918
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:46,542
I almost thought... When we were shooting
this scene, I was thinking,

919
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:49,539
"I hope the sub-zero temperatures
are not restricting the comedy."

920
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:51,185
- It was really cold.
- It was face-freezing.

921
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:54,976
It was kind of like that thing
where you feel your mouth has gone stiff.

922
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:59,936
There's a little bit longer of this
on the deleted scenes.

923
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:01,619
But I really like this scene.

924
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:04,426
And David Bradley and Karl Johnson
together, what a team.

925
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:06,577
I think we both agreed
that we'd have liked to have done

926
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:09,181
another round of translation
before the joke ended, didn't we?

927
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:13,021
Yeah, I think the bit in the deleted scenes,
we screwed it up slightly.

928
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:15,826
We basically left out one of the translations.

929
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,182
But it still kind of works.
I'm still happy with it.

930
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,986
- Nick Frost is incredible in this scene.
- I like this.

931
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:24,696
If you watch him behind me,
his little face is brilliant.

932
00:41:24,787 --> 00:41:30,020
This is the Lethal Weapon trailer music
by John Alexander.

933
00:41:30,107 --> 00:41:32,667
Not the score from the film,
just from the trailer,

934
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:34,339
which, to my mind, is like...

935
00:41:34,427 --> 00:41:35,826
It's almost, you know, in the same way

936
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:38,102
that we use the Dawn of the Dead music
in Shaun of the Dead,

937
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:41,577
this particular percussive music
makes me think of action films.

938
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,305
- I think of the Warner Brothers logo...
- Me, too.

939
00:41:43,387 --> 00:41:45,742
...at the start of Lethal Weapon
or I just think of the trailers.

940
00:41:45,827 --> 00:41:47,704
Yeah, I really remember that music
from the trailer.

941
00:41:47,787 --> 00:41:50,984
I think we spoke about it
when we were writing the film.

942
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:53,058
It was more memorable
than the actual soundtrack.

943
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:56,981
Well, when I was a projectionist,
before I was sacked,

944
00:41:57,467 --> 00:41:58,820
in the three months before I was sacked...

945
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:02,422
- And why were you sacked?
- Because I was rubbish. I was inept.

946
00:42:02,507 --> 00:42:06,341
But I must've seen
the Lethal Weapon 2 teaser trailer 400 times.

947
00:42:07,347 --> 00:42:10,464
A crane shot here, amazingly,
to go over this hedge.

948
00:42:10,547 --> 00:42:12,697
But I think that's a pretty amazing stunt.

949
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:15,255
It seems simple,
but you can write those things in the script

950
00:42:15,347 --> 00:42:16,382
thinking, "They jump over a hedge,"

951
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,617
but actually doing it in one shot
is quite difficult.

952
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:21,824
Yeah, and also a little optical illusion there,

953
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:24,216
because there was a ramp on the other side
for us to get up,

954
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:26,662
and the hedge was higher anyway,
wasn't it?

955
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:28,942
Was that to facilitate the crane shot a bit?

956
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:31,700
Also to get you high enough to clear it.

957
00:42:31,787 --> 00:42:34,506
I like the kicking the sea mine. That's funny.

958
00:42:34,707 --> 00:42:36,743
Now, if you notice, in the Bill Bailey shots,

959
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:41,025
the joke which you can see very briefly here,
lain M. Banks.

960
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:43,383
Basically, one of the twins
is reading lain Banks

961
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:45,105
and other one is reading lain M. Banks.

962
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,747
That was our way
of distinguishing between the two.

963
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:50,057
And so that was a little sight gag

964
00:42:50,147 --> 00:42:53,264
that we thought up
and put in for people to...

965
00:42:53,347 --> 00:42:55,338
I'm amazed that people spot that, actually.

966
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:56,621
- I would've...
- A couple of people have.

967
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,301
Well, it's on so fast.
I'm amazed that people spot that.

968
00:42:59,387 --> 00:43:00,786
It's pretty crazy.

969
00:43:01,267 --> 00:43:02,461
This was a tough one to shoot,

970
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:05,266
just 'cause of Nick
being the funniest man in the world.

971
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,507
If we could've afforded it,
we would've painted out Nick's tattoo,

972
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:12,507
- 'cause it doesn't seem like...
- But you know what?

973
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,496
I was thinking about this the other day.

974
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:16,056
I think it's something...
I don't imagine Danny...

975
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:17,496
I think he's probably had

976
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:19,498
quite a troubled teenage life,
do you know what I mean?

977
00:43:19,587 --> 00:43:21,464
I can imagine him
hanging around Glastonbury drinking cider

978
00:43:21,547 --> 00:43:23,299
before he shaped up
and joined the force with his dad.

979
00:43:23,387 --> 00:43:25,776
Do you think maybe he had
Ozric Tentacles-style hair at one point?

980
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:29,064
I think so, and I think he had a tat done
one festival year,

981
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:31,263
and once it's done, it's done.

982
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:32,985
- I'll have a pint of lager, please.
- Yeah, Roy.

983
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:34,056
"Yeah, Roy."

984
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:35,500
Another little reference
to Shaun of the Dead.

985
00:43:35,587 --> 00:43:37,339
- All my good work.
- And Public Enemy.

986
00:43:37,427 --> 00:43:38,462
Yeah.

987
00:43:38,547 --> 00:43:40,139
I love the lighting on the Andes here.

988
00:43:40,227 --> 00:43:43,936
It's like proper moody cop show.

989
00:43:44,027 --> 00:43:48,817
I have to say, I learnt...
Having done 10 or 12 films or whatever,

990
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:52,339
Jess Hall really defined for me
what a DP does.

991
00:43:52,427 --> 00:43:54,065
He paints with light.

992
00:43:54,147 --> 00:43:56,786
Well, he did, and as actors,

993
00:43:58,067 --> 00:44:01,059
we were there to be painted on,
if you know what I mean.

994
00:44:01,147 --> 00:44:03,786
And then you took over when it came to,
obviously, moving the camera

995
00:44:03,867 --> 00:44:05,459
and directing us as people.

996
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:07,060
What we really were trying to go for on this

997
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,865
is we wanted to make it look really glossy,

998
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:12,144
'cause those Tony Scott films,
they look amazing.

999
00:44:12,227 --> 00:44:15,981
And Jess had done a lot
of great commercials and music videos,

1000
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:19,184
and he'd done this film called Stander
with Thomas Jane.

1001
00:44:19,267 --> 00:44:22,259
And I think, particularly in the pub,
the lighting is just beautiful,

1002
00:44:22,347 --> 00:44:24,577
especially for... The pub there was tiny.

1003
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:27,386
It was even smaller
than the Winchester set on Shaun.

1004
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:30,106
But look at the lighting in this scene.
It looks beautiful.

1005
00:44:30,187 --> 00:44:34,897
No removable walls, for a start,
and a smaller square footage as well.

1006
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:35,976
Two things to talk about here.

1007
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:37,864
We'll talk about
David Arnold's amazing score later,

1008
00:44:37,947 --> 00:44:41,098
but Uncle Derek is my real uncle.

1009
00:44:41,187 --> 00:44:43,496
In Shaun of the Dead,
we name-check Jill and Derek,

1010
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:45,464
and they're my real auntie and uncle.

1011
00:44:45,547 --> 00:44:48,300
Now, in the first draft of the script,
it didn't have the C-word,

1012
00:44:48,387 --> 00:44:50,264
and then that came in during rehearsal.

1013
00:44:50,347 --> 00:44:54,579
So when we went to Birmingham
to show the film, I had to forewarn them.

1014
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:56,737
And I said to my cousin... I said to him,

1015
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,863
"Just to say,
you get name-checked in the film,

1016
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:00,744
"but also, you get called a rude word."

1017
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:02,943
And my cousin was saying,
"Well, how rude is it?"

1018
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:04,858
I said,
"What's the rudest word you can think of?"

1019
00:45:04,947 --> 00:45:06,858
She goes, "Not a c-n-u-t?"

1020
00:45:06,947 --> 00:45:08,938
- I said, "Yeah."
- "Yes."

1021
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:12,542
But he was remarkably cool about it,
and he thought it was very funny.

1022
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,187
- There's my first smile, proper smile.
- Yeah.

1023
00:45:15,387 --> 00:45:17,981
- Your first smile at 45 minutes.
- Christ.

1024
00:45:19,027 --> 00:45:21,985
I love the fact...
Both of you look really wet-eyed in this.

1025
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:24,023
You're tearing up. It's great.

1026
00:45:24,107 --> 00:45:27,497
I think the line about...
When Danny says about this...

1027
00:45:27,587 --> 00:45:28,576
Traffic collision.

1028
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:32,296
It's so lovely, 'cause he's learnt from Angel,
in terms of the dialect,

1029
00:45:32,387 --> 00:45:35,459
and Angel's learning from him here.
It's a very sweet scene, I think.

1030
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:38,903
Well, it's like they're starting to have
a transference. I like the idea that...

1031
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:41,660
You know, the arc of the characters is like...

1032
00:45:41,747 --> 00:45:46,298
Nicholas Angel gets to kind of let loose
and relax a bit,

1033
00:45:46,387 --> 00:45:48,742
and Danny is going the other way.
He's really...

1034
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:52,581
It's almost like Simon's character
is the first person that's ever inspired him.

1035
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,976
And even though he's doing it
in a slightly copycat way,

1036
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:58,343
he's learning by just repeating
what Angel is saying.

1037
00:45:58,427 --> 00:45:59,462
I think it's sweet.

1038
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:00,866
Now, look out here.

1039
00:46:00,947 --> 00:46:04,701
Timothy looked at the camera,
and I was gonna digitally remove it,

1040
00:46:04,787 --> 00:46:08,097
but I thought it was so funny that I put
a cash register noise on, so check it out.

1041
00:46:08,187 --> 00:46:09,222
He looks right at the camera.

1042
00:46:09,307 --> 00:46:11,377
He's gonna hate me for this,
but I put a till noise on it.

1043
00:46:11,467 --> 00:46:12,661
Look out. Here we go.

1044
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:15,546
Dalton looking straight down the barrel.

1045
00:46:15,627 --> 00:46:17,743
It's like he's being complicit
with the audience.

1046
00:46:17,827 --> 00:46:20,739
I know. It's almost like
a tiny breaking-the-fourth-wall moment.

1047
00:46:20,827 --> 00:46:22,021
Now, just going quickly back,

1048
00:46:22,107 --> 00:46:24,382
there's a bit of digital blood
in the ketchup moment, right?

1049
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:26,458
There is, yeah. There's quite a lot of digital.

1050
00:46:26,547 --> 00:46:28,503
Double Negative are so good
at the digital blood

1051
00:46:28,587 --> 00:46:30,225
that I ended up putting more and more on.

1052
00:46:30,307 --> 00:46:33,344
- You can never have enough splats.
- That's not digital beer, though.

1053
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:36,703
No, but it goes between
two different takes here.

1054
00:46:36,787 --> 00:46:39,017
When it goes over to Ron,
that's digital piss, though,

1055
00:46:39,107 --> 00:46:40,142
- amazingly.
- Is it really?

1056
00:46:40,227 --> 00:46:42,263
'Cause the piss ran out
before the end of the shot,

1057
00:46:42,347 --> 00:46:45,305
- and so we had to put in some...
- Is there a little Ron in shot there?

1058
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:48,265
- 'Cause I'm sure you see a little bit of pink.
- There isn't.

1059
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,338
I think that's either his thumb
or the end of the nozzle.

1060
00:46:50,427 --> 00:46:53,066
- But not his nozzle.
- Not his nozzle.

1061
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:54,341
This is Dave Bassett's house.

1062
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:56,941
Yeah, we spoke about this in the other one.

1063
00:46:57,987 --> 00:47:00,740
Living next door to Denis Wise, as well,
the Chelsea player.

1064
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:01,816
Oh, yeah.

1065
00:47:01,907 --> 00:47:04,501
I was always pleased
this got a big old laugh.

1066
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:08,136
Now, Ron Cook... I think he is...

1067
00:47:08,587 --> 00:47:10,100
I'm all right.

1068
00:47:10,187 --> 00:47:12,382
He is the king of the pratfalls.

1069
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:16,056
He's great. And he's great
at playing a sozzled drunk, as well.

1070
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:19,776
If he's like...
I think Ron Cook is the UK king of pratfalls,

1071
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:24,782
and David Cross from Arrested Development
is the king of the fallies in the States.

1072
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:29,465
There was a nice line there in ADR
when he said, "Oh, I'm dying,"

1073
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,981
- but it never really worked.
- Oh, yeah.

1074
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:35,065
I like this being like the end of the first date.

1075
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:37,344
For some reason,
this scene always reminded me...

1076
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:39,258
I call it the Bridget Jones scene.

1077
00:47:39,347 --> 00:47:42,180
Don't know why.
It's just the, "Well, this is me."

1078
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:43,905
That's a snog on the first date.

1079
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,261
The little pleasantries.

1080
00:47:45,347 --> 00:47:47,941
It's very much framed like the scene
outside the Winchester, as well,

1081
00:47:48,027 --> 00:47:49,858
isn't it, in Shaun of the Dead,
when we sing White Lines.

1082
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:51,505
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- The two profiles.

1083
00:47:51,587 --> 00:47:53,657
This is a nice...

1084
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:58,106
Now, what was the first film
to use a bathroom cabinet shock?

1085
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:00,822
- Don't say American Werewolf in London.
- I probably would've done.

1086
00:48:00,907 --> 00:48:03,023
Do say Repulsion, Roman Polanski.
There you go.

1087
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:04,745
- Crikey.
- Maybe it was done even before that,

1088
00:48:04,827 --> 00:48:09,947
but Repulsion was the first film to use the
the-killer's-in-the-bathroom-cabinet-mirror.

1089
00:48:10,027 --> 00:48:12,416
We've done that twice now,

1090
00:48:12,507 --> 00:48:16,819
'cause there was a little play on it
in Shaun with Pete's shadow in the mirror.

1091
00:48:17,507 --> 00:48:20,419
It's a faithful, faithful technique.

1092
00:48:20,507 --> 00:48:22,225
We ripped off John Landis without realising

1093
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:24,980
we'd already ripped off Roman Polanski,
'cause in the film he...

1094
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:26,944
Anyway, this is a nice scene.

1095
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:29,064
And David Arnold's music here...

1096
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:32,059
Here's the thing with David Arnold's score,
which is amazing,

1097
00:48:32,147 --> 00:48:35,776
is we basically had to try and really...

1098
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:37,744
We couldn't really afford to do

1099
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:41,740
a really full, orchestral, expensive score
for the whole thing.

1100
00:48:42,147 --> 00:48:44,422
However, David's plan,
which worked brilliantly,

1101
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:47,658
is that we did two days of orchestral stuff
at AIR Studios,

1102
00:48:47,747 --> 00:48:50,864
and it builds into these moments,

1103
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:54,906
so David said, "We can't afford to do
a really expensive score for the whole thing,

1104
00:48:54,987 --> 00:48:58,457
"but if you pick your moments,
it will really start to soar when it needs to."

1105
00:48:58,547 --> 00:49:01,141
I think it works a treat,
'cause it was electronic for the first half,

1106
00:49:01,227 --> 00:49:03,104
and then in moments like this when it's...

1107
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:07,260
The score in this scene is just brilliant,
and your performances are so funny.

1108
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:09,303
- It's great.
- It was very early on in the shoot, actually.

1109
00:49:09,387 --> 00:49:11,025
It was in the first week.

1110
00:49:11,107 --> 00:49:13,575
But it was amazing
watching him do this music.

1111
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:15,897
Now, this is my DVD collection.

1112
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:17,818
Your DVD collection? No, not yours.

1113
00:49:17,907 --> 00:49:22,105
Me and Oscar, my brother,
and Joe Cornish's DVD collection combined.

1114
00:49:22,987 --> 00:49:25,376
However, I must say
that at the end of the shoot,

1115
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:27,298
quite a few of them had been stolen.

1116
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:29,901
- No!
- Somebody stole my King Kong.

1117
00:49:29,987 --> 00:49:32,217
- Oh, my goodness.
- I had to re-buy it.

1118
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:34,975
- This is obviously...
- '76 version, yeah?

1119
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:38,696
- I have '76, '33, and I have the '60s.
- Yeah, me, too.

1120
00:49:38,787 --> 00:49:39,856
I have all three of them.

1121
00:49:39,947 --> 00:49:42,256
- I do as well.
- I quite enjoy the '76 version.

1122
00:49:42,627 --> 00:49:43,821
This is Point Break, of course.

1123
00:49:43,907 --> 00:49:47,582
Now, we got permission
from Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze,

1124
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:49,225
and Martin Lawrence and Will Smith,
didn't we?

1125
00:49:49,307 --> 00:49:53,619
Also Patrick Swayze's stunt double.
You have to get licences from everybody.

1126
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:54,862
I always thought Point Break...

1127
00:49:54,947 --> 00:49:57,097
I remember, the first time
I ever saw anything of Point Break

1128
00:49:57,187 --> 00:49:58,506
was on Moving Pictures on BBC Two.

1129
00:49:58,587 --> 00:50:02,819
They had a piece
about the making of the foot chase

1130
00:50:02,907 --> 00:50:03,976
which absolutely blew my mind.

1131
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,980
That foot chase in Point Break
is one of my favourite scenes of all time.

1132
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:09,906
We watched a lot of foot...

1133
00:50:09,987 --> 00:50:12,865
The three I remember watching for research
were, obviously, Point Break,

1134
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:14,778
but also Raising Arizona and Narc, as well.

1135
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:17,427
Narc's a good foot chase.
Also, Busting has an amazing foot chase.

1136
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:19,179
- Look at that. There goes Dave.
- Oh, yeah.

1137
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,336
Now, I want to know...

1138
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:23,146
'Cause a lot of that is digital.
There's some real flame elements.

1139
00:50:23,227 --> 00:50:25,138
What did Dave Bassett make of that
when he saw it?

1140
00:50:25,227 --> 00:50:26,262
He was probably glad.

1141
00:50:26,347 --> 00:50:28,497
Now, this line...

1142
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:30,896
Whoever wrote this line in Bad Boys II
deserves an Oscar,

1143
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:32,102
because this is the most...

1144
00:50:32,187 --> 00:50:33,506
This shit just got real.

1145
00:50:33,587 --> 00:50:36,021
In those films, when you have
what's called the point of no return

1146
00:50:36,107 --> 00:50:37,460
at the end of act two,

1147
00:50:37,547 --> 00:50:39,583
when the chips are down

1148
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:42,818
but our heroes are gonna
face up to the final onslaught...

1149
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:47,935
Whoever then reduced it to the line
"This shit just got real" is a genius.

1150
00:50:48,027 --> 00:50:49,096
But what had just happened in the film?

1151
00:50:49,187 --> 00:50:50,984
Because I think a lot of shit had been real
before that.

1152
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:54,104
Hadn't they been chased by a car
that was throwing cars off the back of a car?

1153
00:50:54,187 --> 00:50:56,940
They'd already taken on the Ku Klux Klan
and the Haitians.

1154
00:50:57,027 --> 00:50:58,540
- And then it's real.
- And then it's real.

1155
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:00,618
- Then they have to go to Cuba.
- Cocks.

1156
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:02,695
This...

1157
00:51:03,347 --> 00:51:06,066
Look, there's Lucy, Tim and Lorraine
in the background there,

1158
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,866
just skulking around,
the killers at the scene of the crime.

1159
00:51:08,947 --> 00:51:10,858
- And Greg and Sheree as well.
- Yeah.

1160
00:51:10,947 --> 00:51:13,586
It's funny,
I like playing out these scenes in one shot.

1161
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:15,862
It's a really good thing to do
for performances.

1162
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,778
And then sometimes you can get in a pickle,

1163
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,745
'cause if you want to cut something out,
you're kind of screwed.

1164
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,022
We haven't mentioned
our good friend Adam Buxton.

1165
00:51:23,107 --> 00:51:26,019
- Adam Buxton is fantastic.
- Playing Tim Messenger,

1166
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:28,223
who came up with the little "hi-hi" himself.

1167
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:31,617
This is Fire
by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown.

1168
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:32,696
Look at him.

1169
00:51:33,627 --> 00:51:36,505
Now, if you listen to that on the ADR,
you hear Bill Bailey's...

1170
00:51:36,587 --> 00:51:39,943
He did a lot of radio dialogue, and he has
this great line about Backdraft here.

1171
00:51:40,027 --> 00:51:41,346
"Like something out of Backdraft."

1172
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:44,464
He did a whole load of stuff in the dub
which is hilarious.

1173
00:51:44,547 --> 00:51:47,380
I love the little bit,
which I didn't hear until the cast and crew,

1174
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:50,300
when you hear the Andes ordering
a bacon sandwich when they go to the...

1175
00:51:50,387 --> 00:51:52,582
- "Can I have a bacon bap?"
- A bacon bap.

1176
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:55,704
The idea with the Andes
and Danny and Angel

1177
00:51:55,787 --> 00:51:58,585
was that in a lot of films,
in most cop films, you get the other team.

1178
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:01,181
You get it in Beverly Hills Cop,
you get it in Point Break,

1179
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:03,144
Bad Boys, The Super Cops.

1180
00:52:03,227 --> 00:52:05,866
All of those films have the other team.

1181
00:52:05,947 --> 00:52:08,984
And in a way,
the idea for Danny and Angel is that usually

1182
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:12,298
the leads of the film are cool
and the other guys are nerds

1183
00:52:12,387 --> 00:52:16,938
or sort of stuck-up or kind of...

1184
00:52:17,627 --> 00:52:19,026
So they're just antagonistic, are they?

1185
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:21,780
They're kind of wiseacre...

1186
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:26,258
But we liked the idea that our film
was following the nerd detective.

1187
00:52:28,267 --> 00:52:32,260
Yeah, they're kind of sticklers.
I mean, Angel is the ultimate stickler.

1188
00:52:32,787 --> 00:52:38,305
Maybe we should've called your character
Kevin Stickler. Sergeant Kevin Stickler.

1189
00:52:38,987 --> 00:52:41,342
And maybe we should say something...
Let's say it at the end.

1190
00:52:41,427 --> 00:52:42,985
But, obviously, Nicholas Angel
was lifted from a friend of ours

1191
00:52:48,227 --> 00:52:49,227
- who worked on the film.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

1192
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:50,216
We never refer to him as Nick Angel.
The real guy is Nick Angel.

1193
00:52:50,347 --> 00:52:53,145
And we just thought Nick Angel
was such a great name for a cop.

1194
00:52:53,227 --> 00:52:54,865
But Nicholas is never called Nick.

1195
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:56,619
Only one person calls him Nick
in the whole film,

1196
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,299
and that's one of the Andes at the end.

1197
00:52:58,387 --> 00:52:59,706
- Yeah.
- He's actually Nicholas.

1198
00:52:59,787 --> 00:53:03,575
Somebody on the Internet says
that you call Danny by Ed's name.

1199
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:05,100
- That's bollocks, isn't it?
- No.

1200
00:53:05,187 --> 00:53:07,064
That sounds like
something out of the end of Star Wars.

1201
00:53:07,147 --> 00:53:09,024
You should stop reading the Internet.

1202
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:13,375
But it sounds like the thing when they say
that Mark Hamill says "Carrie" at the end.

1203
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:14,661
I know. I know.

1204
00:53:14,747 --> 00:53:18,422
Now, the spit roast joke,
we obviously missed there.

1205
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:19,622
Olivia spoke about that.

1206
00:53:19,707 --> 00:53:23,336
I love the fact that she said,
"That's me just after a few pints."

1207
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,778
Not even after a bottle of whisky.

1208
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:29,701
For some reason, this scene here
really reminds me of Tony Scott coverage,

1209
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:30,822
the real long-lens shots.

1210
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,626
If you listen, Rafe goes, "Police time."

1211
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:36,426
He just repeats Paddy's joke,
which I found funny.

1212
00:53:36,507 --> 00:53:37,906
It was a beautiful day, this.

1213
00:53:37,987 --> 00:53:40,455
We had such bad weather shooting this film,

1214
00:53:40,547 --> 00:53:43,061
and then when it came to the fête,
we finally got some sun,

1215
00:53:43,147 --> 00:53:44,819
and it really worked out.

1216
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:50,022
If you go back to Shaun of the Dead
and see Rafe's physical transformation,

1217
00:53:50,107 --> 00:53:51,460
it's almost as amazing

1218
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:55,540
as if you watched Big Nothing and then this
to see my physical transformation

1219
00:53:55,627 --> 00:53:57,185
from potato to chip.

1220
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,666
You get to waltz off...

1221
00:53:58,747 --> 00:54:00,385
I love Stuart Wilson.

1222
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:03,300
- He's such a great actor. So...
- He's brilliant.

1223
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:06,663
He's so brilliant and he's such a chameleon,
like David Threlfall as well.

1224
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:08,942
Nick watched Lethal Weapon 3
the other day,

1225
00:54:09,027 --> 00:54:11,302
and I said, "Oh, did you like Stuart in it?"
He said, "Who?"

1226
00:54:11,387 --> 00:54:14,857
I said, "Stuart's the baddy. Jack Travis."
He goes, "No way!"

1227
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:20,101
He hadn't even realised that Stuart
was the lead baddy in Lethal Weapon 3.

1228
00:54:20,187 --> 00:54:23,224
The thing I love about the actors in the film,
because they're so good,

1229
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:27,346
whenever they're onscreen,
they absolutely give it 110%.

1230
00:54:27,427 --> 00:54:29,418
This is a great example of Stuart doing that.

1231
00:54:29,507 --> 00:54:33,022
The relish is fantastic.

1232
00:54:33,387 --> 00:54:35,947
This scene with the rifle range is really...

1233
00:54:36,387 --> 00:54:38,776
One of the films that we watched
when we were researching,

1234
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:42,303
we watched Unforgiven again,
which stood up so amazingly well.

1235
00:54:42,387 --> 00:54:43,615
What an amazing script.

1236
00:54:43,707 --> 00:54:47,336
And we really liked the portent of,
in that film, Clint Eastwood's character.

1237
00:54:47,427 --> 00:54:50,624
You hear of him being a great killer,

1238
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:52,937
and he's kind of changed his ways,

1239
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:55,222
and you're waiting
for the violence to break out again.

1240
00:54:55,307 --> 00:54:56,706
And we kind of wanted to do that.

1241
00:54:56,787 --> 00:54:59,142
Not with violence, but the idea
that Angel is an amazing marksman

1242
00:54:59,227 --> 00:55:01,821
but he doesn't really touch his rifle.

1243
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:05,024
It's like he's off the drink, isn't he?

1244
00:55:05,107 --> 00:55:07,496
It's like he can't...
Well, it is like the Unforgiven.

1245
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:09,737
It's like when he takes the drink,
that's when things go bad.

1246
00:55:09,827 --> 00:55:11,385
It's like as soon as Angel touches a gun...

1247
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:15,016
Yeah, I like the fact when you touch the gun,
you look slightly soiled, don't you?

1248
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:16,620
He gets a little shudder.

1249
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:19,301
Here, there's a feedback cliché right there.

1250
00:55:19,387 --> 00:55:21,105
Also, that's another cliché.

1251
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:23,098
If somebody
like Adam Buxton's character says,

1252
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:26,099
"I've got something important to tell you.
Meet me in five minutes,"

1253
00:55:26,187 --> 00:55:28,417
it means they are going to die.

1254
00:55:29,187 --> 00:55:30,256
Big-time.

1255
00:55:30,347 --> 00:55:31,985
I had such fun shooting this scene.

1256
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:35,139
It's probably my thing
that I'm probably proudest of in the film,

1257
00:55:35,227 --> 00:55:39,778
just because we used a lot of crane stuff,
crane shots in this.

1258
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:42,142
And I'm a really big Brian De Palma fan,

1259
00:55:42,227 --> 00:55:45,936
and I wanted to try
and even vaguely approximate

1260
00:55:46,027 --> 00:55:48,461
one of his big set pieces and stuff.

1261
00:55:48,547 --> 00:55:51,584
Obviously there's a nod
to The Omen, as well, with this.

1262
00:55:51,907 --> 00:55:55,900
The other thing that this makes a nod to,
just to show that we are all references,

1263
00:55:55,987 --> 00:55:58,376
is the film Death on the Nile

1264
00:55:58,467 --> 00:56:01,425
has that scene where Lois Chiles
and Simon MacCorkindale

1265
00:56:01,507 --> 00:56:03,737
are almost crushed by a falling stone.

1266
00:56:04,187 --> 00:56:06,382
And so this is our idea of rectifying that

1267
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:09,106
by showing everybody what
they want to see, which is two people...

1268
00:56:09,187 --> 00:56:11,178
Well, somebody getting crushed
by a big stone.

1269
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:16,261
I love the fact that you managed
to create tension by using a tombola.

1270
00:56:16,387 --> 00:56:18,105
I know. The tombola of doom.

1271
00:56:18,187 --> 00:56:19,222
Look, I love...

1272
00:56:19,307 --> 00:56:21,867
These shots, that's about 200 foot up
on St Cuthbert's Church,

1273
00:56:21,947 --> 00:56:24,507
and I'm from Wells,
but I've never been up on that roof.

1274
00:56:24,587 --> 00:56:27,545
And up there,
doing those crane shots was amazing.

1275
00:56:27,627 --> 00:56:29,504
Just the view was incredible.

1276
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:33,980
The music in this bit
that David did is brilliant.

1277
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:37,503
The supreme irony that the church roof
needing repair is the very thing...

1278
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:38,781
Hi-hi.

1279
00:56:40,947 --> 00:56:41,982
...that kills Messenger.

1280
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:43,819
There goes the 12A.

1281
00:56:44,787 --> 00:56:47,255
That lovely little bit of theremin noise there.

1282
00:56:47,347 --> 00:56:48,416
Oh, yeah.

1283
00:56:48,507 --> 00:56:50,259
Well, that... We were really...

1284
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:54,706
Yeah, the sound work in this
by Hackenbacker, as well, is incredible.

1285
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:55,776
But...

1286
00:56:56,707 --> 00:56:59,779
Pretty much,
if you see the storyboards to the film,

1287
00:56:59,867 --> 00:57:02,256
it was storyboarded exactly like this.

1288
00:57:02,347 --> 00:57:06,625
However, it still came off a lot, lot better
than I could've ever hoped.

1289
00:57:06,707 --> 00:57:09,221
It was basically a combination
of physical and digital effects,

1290
00:57:09,307 --> 00:57:12,344
and both Artem and Double Negative
just did an amazing job.

1291
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:15,305
It looked good on the day
with the physical effect,

1292
00:57:15,387 --> 00:57:17,457
which was obviously a fake head,

1293
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:20,698
but even then you could tell
it was gonna be spectacular.

1294
00:57:20,787 --> 00:57:25,622
I really like using the wide angle
to get all of the ensemble in.

1295
00:57:25,707 --> 00:57:30,986
You know, I really like having things
very posed and stuff.

1296
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:34,059
It's worth mentioning, actually,
about Edgar and myself,

1297
00:57:34,147 --> 00:57:37,423
when we wrote the Fisher character,
Kevin's character,

1298
00:57:37,507 --> 00:57:39,975
he's always the last to cotton onto anything.

1299
00:57:40,067 --> 00:57:41,546
Oh, yeah. He's always the last to laugh.

1300
00:57:41,627 --> 00:57:44,744
Yeah, he's the last to laugh at all the jokes,
he's the last to notice Messenger.

1301
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:46,977
He's just always one step behind everybody.

1302
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:50,104
I just like him doing this serious scene
with the Spider-Man face paint still on.

1303
00:57:50,187 --> 00:57:52,655
- Yeah.
- Sergeant Spider-Man in full effect.

1304
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:54,500
Sergeant P. Parker.

1305
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:59,020
We wanted to shoot this at night

1306
00:57:59,107 --> 00:58:01,063
and we ended up shooting it day-for-night.

1307
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:02,341
And it looks beautiful, actually.

1308
00:58:02,427 --> 00:58:03,906
I was really against the idea of shooting it...

1309
00:58:03,987 --> 00:58:06,455
It was pretty damn dark, wasn't it?
'Cause the rain was coming down.

1310
00:58:06,547 --> 00:58:08,105
It was getting dark, yeah.
It was really heavy.

1311
00:58:08,187 --> 00:58:11,577
And everybody was in a foul mood
when they shot this, weren't they?

1312
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:13,225
- Well, it was...
- It was cold.

1313
00:58:13,307 --> 00:58:16,265
It was cold, and also,
as we said in the other commentary,

1314
00:58:16,347 --> 00:58:19,020
sometimes you need to augment the rain
to make it show up,

1315
00:58:19,107 --> 00:58:20,460
so it was double rain.

1316
00:58:20,547 --> 00:58:22,299
Yeah, it was funny.

1317
00:58:23,347 --> 00:58:25,303
I like the fact that now
we're in wet-weather gear.

1318
00:58:25,387 --> 00:58:27,855
If we have action figures,
I want all the costumes we wear.

1319
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:30,017
I like the fact,
A: they've got their sunglasses on.

1320
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:33,144
Also, at the start of it, Paddy,
he's still got a cigarette. It's great.

1321
00:58:33,227 --> 00:58:34,376
The soggy fag.

1322
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:37,504
And the fact that Nick's got a shower cap
on his cowboy hat.

1323
00:58:37,587 --> 00:58:39,657
Nice squeaky noise on the gorilla.

1324
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:43,259
Oh, we didn't mention
in the shooting range scene

1325
00:58:43,347 --> 00:58:45,338
the idea of prefiguring the end of the film.

1326
00:58:45,427 --> 00:58:46,621
Oh, yeah, I said that in the other one.

1327
00:58:46,707 --> 00:58:49,824
Oh, right, about the cuddly monkey.
"Waltz off with the cuddly monkey."

1328
00:58:49,907 --> 00:58:52,705
- It's like Ed's plan in Shaun of the Dead.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1329
00:58:52,787 --> 00:58:54,425
There's always something going on, Danny.

1330
00:58:54,507 --> 00:59:00,423
I have to say, I think Nick Frost's
performance in this film is so good.

1331
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:03,419
And it makes me... I'm so proud.

1332
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:07,182
Well, he did a nice thing in this scene.
We'd written this as a bit puppyish,

1333
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:09,223
and then he said he didn't want to do that

1334
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:10,865
'cause it was too much
like Mike from Spaced.

1335
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:12,983
And so he gets really angry
when you accuse him,

1336
00:59:18,227 --> 00:59:19,216
and I thought that was a great change.

1337
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:20,222
"You don't know when to switch off, mate."

1338
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:21,222
Nice, with the old...

1339
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,701
When you shot that,
did you mean it to seem like a ship?

1340
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:25,618
- It's shot on the Steadicam.
- Because you shot it woozy.

1341
00:59:25,707 --> 00:59:28,824
Yeah, Steadicam has
that slightly floaty feel to it.

1342
00:59:28,907 --> 00:59:31,865
I love this shot coming up,
this one with the monkey.

1343
00:59:32,187 --> 00:59:34,985
- I don't why that makes me laugh.
- Wait a minute.

1344
00:59:35,107 --> 00:59:38,497
I always thought
audio flashbacks are so cheesy.

1345
00:59:38,587 --> 00:59:41,465
Now, the Sandford Citizen is actually
named after the Gloucester Citizen,

1346
00:59:41,547 --> 00:59:43,139
which was the local paper where I grew up.

1347
00:59:43,227 --> 00:59:45,741
Well, we liked the idea...
Because Sandford's a village, essentially,

1348
00:59:45,827 --> 00:59:49,456
it couldn't be a Citizen,
'cause "citizen" is somebody from a city.

1349
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:53,620
So we liked the idea that, even their paper,
they've got ideas above their station.

1350
00:59:53,707 --> 00:59:56,904
'Cause, Wells, where we shot it,
has things on its brochures where it says,

1351
00:59:56,987 --> 00:59:58,625
"England's smallest city."

1352
00:59:58,707 --> 01:00:00,857
Whereas we had, on our brochures,
which you never see, it said,

1353
01:00:00,947 --> 01:00:03,745
"Sandford," it'd say,
"England's largest village."

1354
01:00:04,147 --> 01:00:07,264
They really slightly had ideas
above their station.

1355
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:10,944
Well, here's another cliché,
is the library montage.

1356
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:13,336
Looking for clues. He's on the case.

1357
01:00:13,427 --> 01:00:15,543
The last morning.
We'd been up for God knows how many...

1358
01:00:15,627 --> 01:00:18,505
- You'd been up for about 22 hours that day.
- Oh, that was awful.

1359
01:00:18,587 --> 01:00:19,736
We were so tired.

1360
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:21,306
This is...

1361
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:25,376
The music in this is so sentimental.
It really makes me laugh.

1362
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:28,618
I think some people don't know quite how
to take this scene 'cause it's so soppy.

1363
01:00:28,707 --> 01:00:29,856
"I won it for you."

1364
01:00:29,947 --> 01:00:34,896
But if you look at those films,
any of the most testosterone-driven films,

1365
01:00:34,987 --> 01:00:39,538
like Man on Fire and Con Air and Bad Boys,

1366
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:41,260
they get so homoerotic

1367
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:44,623
and the score is so sweeping
and sentimental.

1368
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:45,822
I really like it.

1369
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:48,660
Well, Bad Boys has got
a really sweeping score, hasn't it?

1370
01:00:48,747 --> 01:00:52,501
Well, they all have.
All of those films, the score is just huge.

1371
01:00:52,587 --> 01:00:55,465
Here we are
back in the town square in Wells.

1372
01:00:56,067 --> 01:00:58,900
In a second,
Nick says the line, "Affirmatron,"

1373
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:02,104
- which we thought...
- We stole that out of S.W.A.T., didn't we?

1374
01:01:02,187 --> 01:01:04,826
No, it's in the film Dark Blue,
the Ron Shelton film,

1375
01:01:04,907 --> 01:01:08,104
and we thought it was such a ridiculous line
that it deserved another airing.

1376
01:01:08,187 --> 01:01:09,825
There you go.

1377
01:01:10,227 --> 01:01:12,582
Much like "younglings"
from Revenge of the Sith

1378
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:13,895
that crops up earlier on.

1379
01:01:13,987 --> 01:01:16,023
Yeah, yeah, a reluctant, but...

1380
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:21,181
A line so awful,
it deserved a second innings.

1381
01:01:21,267 --> 01:01:23,986
And I think Peter Bradshaw picked up
on that, didn't he, in The Guardian?

1382
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:25,386
- He did.
- We were quite pleased with that.

1383
01:01:25,467 --> 01:01:26,946
Somebody saw it.

1384
01:01:27,707 --> 01:01:29,140
- So...
- "Fingered."

1385
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,936
Maybe they were all accidents.
People have accidents every day.

1386
01:01:33,027 --> 01:01:37,339
Well, the idea with this
is that they get on the case...

1387
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:42,421
We really wanted Nicholas
to be shut out of the investigation,

1388
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:46,819
be the police officer on the periphery
who has to crack the case.

1389
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:51,298
And so it's almost like he's trying
to link the murders on his own time.

1390
01:01:51,387 --> 01:01:54,936
Well, he's on the outside of the cordon
when the Andes are inside doing nothing.

1391
01:01:55,027 --> 01:01:57,621
Yeah, that was a vision
that we tried to get across,

1392
01:01:57,707 --> 01:02:01,382
which you see a little bit,
is the idea of that being,

1393
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:04,106
again, that sort of slightly
Rosencrantz & Guildenstern thing

1394
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,781
about being the people
on the edges of a big story.

1395
01:02:06,867 --> 01:02:07,902
Yeah.

1396
01:02:07,987 --> 01:02:09,022
Of course.

1397
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:13,146
"Just about to pop off." She is going to die.

1398
01:02:13,227 --> 01:02:15,582
Now we understand
why Anne Reid is in the film,

1399
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:17,464
'cause she has a wonderful monologue.

1400
01:02:17,547 --> 01:02:20,345
Again, not only saying "about to pop off,"

1401
01:02:20,427 --> 01:02:23,578
but if you see a close-up
of some sharp implements,

1402
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:26,625
that means that somebody is going to die
very shortly.

1403
01:02:26,707 --> 01:02:30,017
So I would hope that thriller fans
would watch the film thinking,

1404
01:02:30,107 --> 01:02:32,063
"I know there's gonna be
a big bit of dialogue here,

1405
01:02:32,147 --> 01:02:35,583
"but at the end of it,
there might be some blood and killings."

1406
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:40,104
But the hilariously contrived line,
"I can never find my scissors," as well...

1407
01:02:40,187 --> 01:02:42,178
- I know.
...which is just a way of explaining

1408
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:44,178
why there's a massive pair of shears
on the desk.

1409
01:02:44,267 --> 01:02:46,861
I know. Here's the murder weapon.

1410
01:02:47,387 --> 01:02:50,106
She did such a great job with this.

1411
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:53,418
And it's nice as well, though, 'cause we do
a lot of tracking in, in other places.

1412
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:56,624
But doing a zoom
is a bit more like a '70s film,

1413
01:02:56,707 --> 01:02:59,540
using the zoom instead of the dolly.

1414
01:02:59,627 --> 01:03:03,779
You know, you sort of make things
a bit more intense by zooming in.

1415
01:03:04,267 --> 01:03:06,827
It's not on a wide angle. It's... Sorry.

1416
01:03:06,907 --> 01:03:11,503
- Don't say... I wasn't yawning.
- No, no. I was boring myself. I'm sorry.

1417
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:14,340
I know, also, you know,

1418
01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:18,943
that's something you learn
when you start doing the films,

1419
01:03:19,027 --> 01:03:21,143
is the difference
between panning in and zooming in

1420
01:03:21,227 --> 01:03:23,536
and what quality that gives to the film.

1421
01:03:23,627 --> 01:03:26,141
And I think you just summed that up.
Don't talk about it again.

1422
01:03:26,227 --> 01:03:28,058
You're watching Hot Fuzz.

1423
01:03:28,147 --> 01:03:29,580
But, no, Anne Reid's...

1424
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:31,942
But as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

1425
01:03:32,027 --> 01:03:33,460
That always got a good laugh.

1426
01:03:34,547 --> 01:03:36,378
I think we added, in the ADR,
we added an extra "fuh"

1427
01:03:36,467 --> 01:03:38,742
to really make the "fuck" work.

1428
01:03:38,827 --> 01:03:40,306
- "The fuck work."
- "The fuck work."

1429
01:03:40,387 --> 01:03:42,901
One thing I love is fuck work.

1430
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:46,423
That was Mike Kelt
playing that particular hooded figure.

1431
01:03:46,507 --> 01:03:50,182
- That's right.
- This idea of the murder, we...

1432
01:03:50,267 --> 01:03:51,495
Nice stunt coming up here.

1433
01:03:51,587 --> 01:03:54,624
We re-shot this to make it a bit better,
this shot.

1434
01:03:54,707 --> 01:03:56,698
Nice. Nice stunt.

1435
01:03:56,787 --> 01:03:58,505
The idea with the murders, actually,

1436
01:03:58,587 --> 01:04:01,021
is that Nick essentially
gets closer and closer to it.

1437
01:04:01,107 --> 01:04:04,622
It's like the first murder happens kind of...

1438
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:06,823
They're the last people to see them alive.

1439
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:09,182
Second murder,
they deliver him to his door.

1440
01:04:09,267 --> 01:04:13,055
Third murder, he literally sees it,
and fourth mordor...

1441
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:16,539
- Fourth mordor?
- The fourth mordor. Peter Jackson's back.

1442
01:04:16,627 --> 01:04:18,697
No, I just like the idea
he gets closer and closer to it,

1443
01:04:18,787 --> 01:04:21,859
and the last murder,
it happening right behind him,

1444
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:25,223
is kind of like those giallo films
like Bird with the Crystal Plumage,

1445
01:04:25,307 --> 01:04:28,856
Dario Argento, the idea of being right there
when it happens

1446
01:04:28,947 --> 01:04:31,063
but not really having
all the pieces of the puzzle.

1447
01:04:31,147 --> 01:04:34,776
Now, one thing
that we stretched credibility with

1448
01:04:34,867 --> 01:04:37,461
is the idea that the NWA operative,
whoever this is,

1449
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:38,775
and I kind of think it's Lurch,

1450
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:40,664
would do it while Angel was there.

1451
01:04:40,747 --> 01:04:43,784
I know. They have a relay team, as well,
which is pretty impressive.

1452
01:04:43,867 --> 01:04:46,779
Yeah. It's almost like they're teasing Angel.

1453
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:51,987
It's almost like they're so confident
that they even flaunt it in front of him.

1454
01:04:52,467 --> 01:04:55,743
That's what's so funny when you watch
a lot of these thrillers with murders,

1455
01:04:55,827 --> 01:05:00,184
is to really examine the logic
of how they pulled off...

1456
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:02,303
If you look at those Agatha Christie films,

1457
01:05:02,387 --> 01:05:06,221
all of the murders is built
on this absolute split-second timing...

1458
01:05:06,307 --> 01:05:08,218
- Absolutely.
...that could go so wrong.

1459
01:05:08,307 --> 01:05:09,626
These harebrained schemes.

1460
01:05:09,707 --> 01:05:12,096
The fact that the red nail varnish
went under the sofa.

1461
01:05:12,187 --> 01:05:13,461
- Yeah, absolutely.
- All this kind of stuff.

1462
01:05:13,547 --> 01:05:18,018
Or that they... Yeah, they put
some kind of nail varnish on their leg

1463
01:05:18,107 --> 01:05:19,859
whilst Jane Birkin's back was turned.

1464
01:05:19,947 --> 01:05:23,656
I love the idea that the killers,
they had a whole relay team there.

1465
01:05:23,747 --> 01:05:25,339
It was really well thought out.

1466
01:05:25,427 --> 01:05:28,021
We had a term for it that we'd always use

1467
01:05:28,107 --> 01:05:31,417
and would gleefully employ,
which is, of course, popcorn logic,

1468
01:05:31,507 --> 01:05:34,897
which these films
always use a liberal helping of.

1469
01:05:35,467 --> 01:05:38,982
A lot of these films,
the logic does not stand up to...

1470
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:40,102
Close scrutiny.

1471
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:42,178
After five minutes
of leaving the cinema, you go,

1472
01:05:42,267 --> 01:05:44,098
- "Hang on."
- "Hang on."

1473
01:05:46,387 --> 01:05:48,139
I love the way everybody just laughs.

1474
01:05:48,227 --> 01:05:50,343
- I know.
- Sandford's such a happy place.

1475
01:05:50,427 --> 01:05:52,099
I love Nick's little look down

1476
01:05:52,187 --> 01:05:54,064
when you mention the peace lily there.
It's funny.

1477
01:05:54,147 --> 01:05:57,105
The interesting thing to note
about the peace lily is,

1478
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:59,462
in the original draft of the film,

1479
01:05:59,547 --> 01:06:03,335
we had a character called Victoria.
We had a girlfriend part for Nicholas.

1480
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:06,578
And the first draft of the film was too long

1481
01:06:07,387 --> 01:06:08,502
and, basically, we cut her out,

1482
01:06:08,587 --> 01:06:11,101
but we gave a lot of her dialogue
to Nick Frost,

1483
01:06:11,187 --> 01:06:14,099
'cause we thought, essentially,
Nick is playing the girlfriend role in this.

1484
01:06:14,187 --> 01:06:16,906
So all of the dialogue about the peace lily

1485
01:06:16,987 --> 01:06:18,306
was written for a lady,

1486
01:06:18,387 --> 01:06:20,139
and it sounds so much funnier
coming out of Nick's mouth.

1487
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:21,296
Absolutely.

1488
01:06:21,387 --> 01:06:22,706
The "M" word, Nicholas.

1489
01:06:22,787 --> 01:06:25,904
- "The 'M' word."
- In the background you see Jim's...

1490
01:06:25,987 --> 01:06:27,466
- Jim's pistols.
- His pistols. Also, his cape.

1491
01:06:27,547 --> 01:06:30,107
Like, his Batman cape. It's even lit up.

1492
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:31,825
His baddy's cape.

1493
01:06:31,907 --> 01:06:33,499
"I know who did it."

1494
01:06:38,747 --> 01:06:39,747
You do your St Ivel Gold voice there,
your deep...

1495
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:40,747
Explain the St Ivel Gold thing, Simon.

1496
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:44,137
Well, that was a "Half the fat
and a buttery taste" kind of voice.

1497
01:06:44,227 --> 01:06:48,220
And Edgar would often say, "More St Ivel,
more St Ivel, " from behind the camera,

1498
01:06:48,307 --> 01:06:51,344
much to the bemusement
of some of the crew and actors,

1499
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:52,496
but I knew what he meant.

1500
01:06:52,587 --> 01:06:55,021
I'm slightly distracted by Alice's pins again.

1501
01:06:55,107 --> 01:06:56,699
- Hey, come on.
- And Dalton's pins.

1502
01:06:56,787 --> 01:07:00,700
Dalton's got great calves.
I haven't seen his thighs.

1503
01:07:00,787 --> 01:07:03,779
Dalton... That man is so handsome.

1504
01:07:03,867 --> 01:07:09,419
And he's so... You know.
The man is 62 and he's a stone-cold fox.

1505
01:07:09,507 --> 01:07:13,625
- That's no question.
- He causes lady-quakes wherever he goes.

1506
01:07:14,347 --> 01:07:17,578
When he's walking down Wells' high street,
he could have had the pick of the bunch.

1507
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:20,420
I watched this with, I think,
my mum and my sister and my wife,

1508
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:22,225
and they all went "phwoar"
when he came on.

1509
01:07:22,307 --> 01:07:24,298
And they represent different generations.

1510
01:07:24,387 --> 01:07:26,457
Now, this was something...

1511
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:28,617
I don't think this was ever written
into the script.

1512
01:07:28,707 --> 01:07:30,902
I think, because we tried to cut down
on stage directions,

1513
01:07:30,987 --> 01:07:35,344
all it said in the script was,
"We see lots of flash cuts and flashbacks.

1514
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:38,578
"It looks pretty cool for a British film."
That was what was written in the script.

1515
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:40,100
I don't think we actually...

1516
01:07:40,187 --> 01:07:43,145
In some instances,
we didn't even script the...

1517
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:44,660
- The flashbacks at all.
- The flashbacks.

1518
01:07:44,747 --> 01:07:47,022
Well, I remember I did,
when I was doing the storyboards.

1519
01:07:47,107 --> 01:07:49,940
I went through all the flashbacks
and the backwards stuff

1520
01:07:50,027 --> 01:07:53,702
and I tried to work it out, because obviously
whip pans work both ways.

1521
01:07:53,787 --> 01:07:55,061
They work backwards and forwards.

1522
01:07:55,147 --> 01:07:57,615
So I tried to work it out
so they'd work backwards and forwards,

1523
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:00,699
and I drew it all out in these little scribbles,

1524
01:08:00,787 --> 01:08:05,417
and then when I came to look at it again,
it was like looking at hieroglyphics.

1525
01:08:05,507 --> 01:08:07,702
I was thinking,
"What the hell does that all mean?"

1526
01:08:07,787 --> 01:08:09,937
So I had to go through it again
and work it all out,

1527
01:08:10,027 --> 01:08:12,222
but I really enjoyed
doing all the backwards stuff.

1528
01:08:12,307 --> 01:08:14,298
I just thought it was a nice way
of you replaying...

1529
01:08:14,387 --> 01:08:17,743
Like, for instance, right here,
Timothy Dalton, you see his face.

1530
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,055
He did that scene earlier on,

1531
01:08:19,147 --> 01:08:21,786
but in the earlier scene,
when you see David and Lucy getting killed,

1532
01:08:21,867 --> 01:08:25,382
we painted out his face
so you just see a black hood.

1533
01:08:25,467 --> 01:08:27,025
So, basically, Dalton is in...

1534
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:29,496
Why do we call him Dalton?
We always refer to him by his surname.

1535
01:08:29,587 --> 01:08:31,259
- The Daltonator.
- Timothy.

1536
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:33,578
Also nice to replay that splat.

1537
01:08:33,667 --> 01:08:37,455
You can't see a head getting crushed
enough times in a film.

1538
01:08:38,107 --> 01:08:39,096
- The...
- I think...

1539
01:08:39,187 --> 01:08:40,779
...she was about to sell up
to the developers...

1540
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,266
This is interesting as well,

1541
01:08:42,347 --> 01:08:46,181
'cause the summation is obviously
a complete misconception

1542
01:08:46,267 --> 01:08:47,541
of what's really going on.

1543
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:49,379
And this, what we're seeing,
isn't what happened.

1544
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:51,185
It's what Angel thinks happened,

1545
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:54,862
'cause obviously when we see the truth,
you did it with lots of the NWA there.

1546
01:08:54,947 --> 01:08:58,178
Well, also, we liked the idea that
the real reasons for people being killed

1547
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:03,022
are really, to quote Chris Morris,
"small and twatty."

1548
01:09:03,107 --> 01:09:06,577
But I like that Angel's theory
is really overreaching.

1549
01:09:06,667 --> 01:09:07,986
We really wanted to...

1550
01:09:08,067 --> 01:09:10,297
You know, we watched things
like Chinatown again,

1551
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:14,380
and things that have
a really dense, sort of labyrinthine...

1552
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:15,980
You know, sort of...

1553
01:09:16,067 --> 01:09:18,023
- Is it labyrinthine or labyrinthian?
- Labyrinthine.

1554
01:09:18,107 --> 01:09:20,098
- Labyrinthine.
- Sort of over-dense kind of thing.

1555
01:09:20,187 --> 01:09:22,826
Absolutely.
And it's like he's really over-thought it

1556
01:09:22,907 --> 01:09:25,467
and it's really... Unlike...

1557
01:09:25,547 --> 01:09:28,664
Timothy, obviously, sits there smugly

1558
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:31,102
like the cat who got the cream,
but I like the rest...

1559
01:09:31,187 --> 01:09:32,700
The other officers are like...

1560
01:09:32,787 --> 01:09:35,585
- You know, convinced for a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

1561
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:39,376
There was a line that I really liked
that we actually cut for time when...

1562
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:40,502
The one-stop shop?

1563
01:09:40,587 --> 01:09:45,980
No, when Skinner said,
"The truth is far less Shakespearean."

1564
01:09:46,067 --> 01:09:47,785
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Which I really liked.

1565
01:09:47,867 --> 01:09:49,744
Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.

1566
01:09:49,827 --> 01:09:52,261
I like, with Kevin and Nick there,
who play the butcher boys,

1567
01:09:52,347 --> 01:09:55,066
that you hear their grunt
forwards and backwards. It goes...

1568
01:09:56,307 --> 01:09:57,740
Tina here is a table dancer...

1569
01:09:57,827 --> 01:09:58,862
"At Flappers."

1570
01:09:58,947 --> 01:10:01,700
Look at the way... I love this little exchange.

1571
01:10:03,227 --> 01:10:06,139
I just liked the idea of a lap dancing club
called Flappers.

1572
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:08,866
- Let's go.
- Let's patent it.

1573
01:10:08,947 --> 01:10:10,505
We should have had the wrap party
at Flappers.

1574
01:10:10,587 --> 01:10:12,100
We can start Flappers right now.

1575
01:10:12,187 --> 01:10:14,576
- Screw this doing DVDs.
- Let's get out of here.

1576
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,340
Let's not make any more films.
Let's open a chain of Flappers.

1577
01:10:17,427 --> 01:10:19,782
- That'll confound the critics.
- Yeah.

1578
01:10:20,427 --> 01:10:22,782
- Whose leg was cut?
- I love that.

1579
01:10:22,867 --> 01:10:28,385
It's really Hercule Poirot-ish,
the idea of saying your closing line twice.

1580
01:10:28,467 --> 01:10:30,264
- Yeah.
- "This very evening."

1581
01:10:30,347 --> 01:10:31,905
- "This very evening!"
- "This very evening!"

1582
01:10:31,987 --> 01:10:36,185
He's so certain. He wants to have
the big finish and it doesn't work out.

1583
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:38,542
Little split-focus work from you here.

1584
01:10:38,627 --> 01:10:40,106
- Yeah.
- Very funny.

1585
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:41,666
That's a nice shot.

1586
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,706
- I did have a cameo in here and I cut it out.
- Oh, you cut it out?

1587
01:10:44,787 --> 01:10:49,542
Well, I thought at this point in the film,
if the film was dragging due to my cameo,

1588
01:10:49,627 --> 01:10:51,504
it would look particularly indulgent

1589
01:10:51,587 --> 01:10:55,262
if my cameo at this point
was only adding to the running time.

1590
01:10:55,347 --> 01:10:57,861
Let it never be said we're indulgent.

1591
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,664
I cut out my cameo, for God's sakes.

1592
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:03,022
I know it's been mentioned,

1593
01:11:03,107 --> 01:11:07,020
but I like the fact that Dalton
is so obviously looking at the camera.

1594
01:11:07,107 --> 01:11:09,063
- There's his alibi, the paper...
- Oh, yeah.

1595
01:11:09,147 --> 01:11:11,422
...and posing with the shoppers.
It makes me laugh.

1596
01:11:11,507 --> 01:11:13,338
Yeah, there he is. Look. With his newspaper.

1597
01:11:13,427 --> 01:11:15,019
The music on this bit
makes me laugh as well.

1598
01:11:15,107 --> 01:11:20,943
Again, this score is so swelling and huge.

1599
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:24,137
I'm really glad... I remember there was a time

1600
01:11:24,227 --> 01:11:27,378
when we were trying
to bring it down a little bit,

1601
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:32,097
and you were considering
cutting the dramatics from Skinner there,

1602
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:34,621
and I'm really glad you didn't, 'cause it's...

1603
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:40,942
Timothy's so funny doing the faux sincerity.
It's really funny.

1604
01:11:41,027 --> 01:11:43,336
Also, we must say that...

1605
01:11:43,427 --> 01:11:46,817
I think when Timothy has a moustache,
he has magic powers.

1606
01:11:46,907 --> 01:11:52,140
Dalton with tash is always great.
He's always bad and he's always great.

1607
01:11:52,227 --> 01:11:54,661
- Prince Barin. Case in point.
- Prince Barin. Absolutely.

1608
01:11:54,747 --> 01:11:55,896
Flash Gordon.

1609
01:11:56,827 --> 01:11:59,057
There's a nice little scene with Billie there.

1610
01:11:59,147 --> 01:12:01,456
I love this music on this.

1611
01:12:01,547 --> 01:12:04,505
- This is the...
- Look at Paddy looking at him.

1612
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:06,862
Angel is a broken man at this point.

1613
01:12:08,187 --> 01:12:12,897
I like Nick's little laugh here, after he goes...
This little one here.

1614
01:12:14,547 --> 01:12:15,582
Makes me laugh.

1615
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:17,658
Oh, he's really trying to bring Angel
out of his funk.

1616
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:20,307
- You want anything from the shop?
- Cornetto.

1617
01:12:20,387 --> 01:12:22,059
- Another reference to Shaun of the Dead.
- There you go.

1618
01:12:22,147 --> 01:12:24,183
The idea with this is that we thought...

1619
01:12:24,267 --> 01:12:26,178
In Shaun of the Dead,
we had strawberry Cornettos

1620
01:12:26,267 --> 01:12:27,825
because red denoted blood,

1621
01:12:27,907 --> 01:12:29,898
and original Cornettos
with the blue wrapper

1622
01:12:29,987 --> 01:12:31,784
'cause blue denotes police.

1623
01:12:31,867 --> 01:12:33,744
Who knows what kind of confection
we'll use next?

1624
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:37,615
Well, clearly, if we do a third film together,

1625
01:12:37,707 --> 01:12:39,743
it'd have to have a mint Cornetto
in a green wrapper

1626
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:40,976
to denote something else.

1627
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,501
- What do you mean, if?
- When. When.

1628
01:12:43,587 --> 01:12:44,656
You heard it here first.

1629
01:12:44,747 --> 01:12:46,942
It's gonna have to be
some sort of Arctic adventure.

1630
01:12:47,027 --> 01:12:49,097
Yeah, it'll have to have
something green in it.

1631
01:12:49,187 --> 01:12:52,816
Why don't we just remake
Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster?

1632
01:12:52,907 --> 01:12:53,942
That's got green in it.

1633
01:12:54,027 --> 01:12:57,417
I've always thought it would be really good
to make a brilliant sequel to a bad film.

1634
01:12:57,507 --> 01:12:59,498
Yeah? Like Godzilla...

1635
01:12:59,907 --> 01:13:01,226
No, but the original Godzilla is good.

1636
01:13:01,307 --> 01:13:02,979
What, are you talking about
the Roland Emmerich one?

1637
01:13:03,067 --> 01:13:07,265
Take a film that didn't do that well,
and then make a really good sequel to it.

1638
01:13:07,347 --> 01:13:09,065
I can't think of one
right off the top of my head, but...

1639
01:13:09,147 --> 01:13:12,025
- Twister II.
- Yeah, we'd make it amazing.

1640
01:13:12,107 --> 01:13:14,337
You've come from a city
where there's danger...

1641
01:13:14,427 --> 01:13:18,215
Let's just start the rumour now
that we're making a sequel to Twister.

1642
01:13:18,467 --> 01:13:21,504
This is the other great cliché. This is like...

1643
01:13:21,587 --> 01:13:24,385
Again, if somebody says, "Go home..."

1644
01:13:24,507 --> 01:13:27,067
Usually in a thriller,
like in one of the Dirty Harry films,

1645
01:13:27,147 --> 01:13:29,536
say Magnum Force with Hal Holbrook,

1646
01:13:29,747 --> 01:13:33,660
Callahan will ring up... Clint Eastwood
will ring Hal Holbrook and say,

1647
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:35,021
"I've figured it out."

1648
01:13:35,107 --> 01:13:38,179
And Holbrook goes,
"Stay there. I'm coming over,"

1649
01:13:38,267 --> 01:13:41,100
which means
the hero is about to get attacked.

1650
01:13:41,187 --> 01:13:44,463
Or the conspiracy...
A partner is going to die.

1651
01:13:44,547 --> 01:13:47,345
- It means shit gets deeper.
- The shit just gets real.

1652
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:48,906
The shit gets deeper.

1653
01:13:49,427 --> 01:13:52,100
- I like that one.
- Oh, his little movement there is great.

1654
01:13:52,187 --> 01:13:55,657
I like your really over-dramatic,
"I could do with a walk."

1655
01:13:55,747 --> 01:13:59,820
Now, this was week one, doing that,
and that was week 12.

1656
01:13:59,907 --> 01:14:02,262
That was shot at 5:00 in the morning,
that shot.

1657
01:14:02,347 --> 01:14:04,656
A little Woo reference, quite happenstance,

1658
01:14:04,747 --> 01:14:06,339
'cause those pigeons
just happened to be around.

1659
01:14:06,427 --> 01:14:09,180
You know what? Tony Scott
deserves some credit for the doves.

1660
01:14:09,267 --> 01:14:11,735
I think Tony Scott did it before John Woo,
to be honest.

1661
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:13,863
Well, there you go. Eat that.

1662
01:14:14,747 --> 01:14:17,181
- This was fun to shoot.
- This was your birthday.

1663
01:14:17,267 --> 01:14:19,337
It was. It was a very long day in a tiny room.

1664
01:14:19,427 --> 01:14:21,099
One thing that was cool,
we had this tiny set,

1665
01:14:21,187 --> 01:14:22,381
and we never took the walls out

1666
01:14:22,467 --> 01:14:25,106
because we thought
it would make it more claustrophobic.

1667
01:14:25,187 --> 01:14:26,302
And we really...

1668
01:14:26,387 --> 01:14:29,185
Paul Herbert, our stunt coordinator,
did a really good job here.

1669
01:14:29,267 --> 01:14:31,337
We really wanted to watch a lot of...

1670
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:34,305
There are so many
great close-quarters fights in films.

1671
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:36,742
From Russia with Love, Raising Arizona.

1672
01:14:36,827 --> 01:14:40,024
- Bourne Supremacy.
- Kill Bill: Vol. 2, Bourne Supremacy.

1673
01:14:40,107 --> 01:14:42,462
That's a nice stunt with...
The only bit that Simon didn't do

1674
01:14:42,547 --> 01:14:45,425
is the going-into-the-glass there,
but everything else was you.

1675
01:14:45,507 --> 01:14:49,580
He looked like a mutated Ronaldo.

1676
01:14:49,707 --> 01:14:52,221
The footballer, not our line producer.

1677
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:55,101
We re-shot that, didn't we?

1678
01:14:55,187 --> 01:14:58,259
We did some more shooting on this scene
to kind of amp it up a little bit.

1679
01:14:58,347 --> 01:15:01,305
That whole thing
of when Rory threw me into the cupboard

1680
01:15:01,387 --> 01:15:02,581
and threw me into the chest of drawers...

1681
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:04,897
He's a very strong man, Rory.

1682
01:15:04,987 --> 01:15:08,138
And he used to grab handfuls of my flesh,
not meaning to,

1683
01:15:09,067 --> 01:15:12,742
but when he threw you,
he really did throw you.

1684
01:15:12,867 --> 01:15:16,940
Listen, man, I think your widow's peak
is absolutely suited to thrillers.

1685
01:15:17,027 --> 01:15:19,382
I think you've got the perfect face.

1686
01:15:19,467 --> 01:15:20,900
- You can do comedy...
- For tragedy?

1687
01:15:20,987 --> 01:15:24,024
Yeah, but just for tense. You can look tense.

1688
01:15:24,147 --> 01:15:27,025
It's quite an old hairdo, isn't it, really?

1689
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:30,139
I mean, I'm lumbered with it,
but it's quite a classic look.

1690
01:15:30,227 --> 01:15:33,139
I'm going to call it male-pattern suspense
from now on.

1691
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:38,302
Also, the best thing about your hair
is it's easy to draw.

1692
01:15:38,387 --> 01:15:40,582
That's why I will never work
with a curly-haired actor.

1693
01:15:40,667 --> 01:15:44,376
I will only work with Simon,
because it's like drawing Charlie Brown,

1694
01:15:44,467 --> 01:15:46,423
and then I do
a little Norman Osborn widow's peak.

1695
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:49,260
- Done. Job done.
- Martin Riggs wouldn't have stood a chance.

1696
01:15:49,347 --> 01:15:53,545
I couldn't work with Stephen Mangan.
He's got curly hair.

1697
01:15:53,867 --> 01:15:54,982
I can't draw him.

1698
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:56,898
- Or Guttenberg. Any of the curly Steves.
- Or Guttenberg.

1699
01:15:56,987 --> 01:15:59,785
I'm not going to draw
Julian Rhind-Tutt's hair.

1700
01:16:05,067 --> 01:16:06,067
I'm going to stick with the Pegg.
Apologies to Stephen and Julian.

1701
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:07,067
That was...

1702
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:08,056
This is the Bishop's Palace in Wells.

1703
01:16:08,267 --> 01:16:10,906
Now, this scene... I'm really pleased with it.

1704
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:15,185
This scene was an absolute bitch to shoot
because we were shooting it in June.

1705
01:16:15,267 --> 01:16:16,746
We had six-hour nights,

1706
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:20,706
and, basically,
we would constantly run out of time.

1707
01:16:20,787 --> 01:16:23,506
And as I'm sure
has been mentioned elsewhere,

1708
01:16:23,587 --> 01:16:26,340
basically, when it came round
to Simon's reverses,

1709
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:29,146
we had to shoot them
with the local am dram society.

1710
01:16:29,227 --> 01:16:33,664
All the other actors had gone,
and Simon had the very unfortunate task

1711
01:16:33,747 --> 01:16:36,819
of shooting the scene
without everybody else there.

1712
01:16:36,947 --> 01:16:39,415
There's the little relay race
with the other hooded figures there.

1713
01:16:39,507 --> 01:16:43,056
I think I was...
On the first rehearsal, I was terrified,

1714
01:16:43,147 --> 01:16:45,103
but once they warmed up, they were great.

1715
01:16:45,187 --> 01:16:47,143
And I said
on the other commentary, actually,

1716
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,819
Nick actually read Jim's lines

1717
01:16:48,907 --> 01:16:51,979
because his stand-in hadn't,
obviously, learnt the lines, so...

1718
01:16:52,067 --> 01:16:54,262
He had to keep looking at his sides,
at his script.

1719
01:16:54,347 --> 01:16:55,939
So it was a tough night,

1720
01:16:56,027 --> 01:17:00,623
but I have to extend massive gratitude
to those people for coming and doing that.

1721
01:17:00,707 --> 01:17:02,504
- And they really threw themselves into it.
- Absolutely.

1722
01:17:02,587 --> 01:17:05,181
That was the people
from the little theatre in Wells.

1723
01:17:05,267 --> 01:17:06,336
That's right.

1724
01:17:06,427 --> 01:17:07,940
You're not supposed to say
amateur dramatics.

1725
01:17:08,027 --> 01:17:09,858
You're supposed to say musical society.

1726
01:17:09,947 --> 01:17:12,745
- Really?
- Yeah, am dram is a dirty word.

1727
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:15,739
I think it's 'cause it's become
a little bit synonymous with shite.

1728
01:17:15,827 --> 01:17:18,387
Well, the "amateur" is not nice.
You've got to say musical society

1729
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,061
or the players. Dramatic society.

1730
01:17:21,147 --> 01:17:23,741
I grew up around amateur dramatics,
and as far as I can see,

1731
01:17:23,827 --> 01:17:26,136
it's just a lot of people
doing something because they love it

1732
01:17:26,227 --> 01:17:30,015
rather than they're getting paid for it,
so I've got maximum respect for them,

1733
01:17:30,107 --> 01:17:31,825
and for saving my skin that night.

1734
01:17:31,907 --> 01:17:32,896
I like...

1735
01:17:32,987 --> 01:17:34,864
...and tragically broken his neck.

1736
01:17:35,147 --> 01:17:36,944
I like the fact that Julia goes...

1737
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:39,861
Yeah, like it's sweet.

1738
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:43,735
Now, what I love about this,
in the popcorn logic realm,

1739
01:17:43,827 --> 01:17:47,263
it never entirely explained
how exactly it breaks down

1740
01:17:47,347 --> 01:17:49,463
that they have meetings at night
in a castle with hoods.

1741
01:17:49,547 --> 01:17:51,503
And one's in the town hall,

1742
01:17:51,587 --> 01:17:54,181
- or in the function room at the Swan.
- Or why they wear hoods at all.

1743
01:17:54,267 --> 01:17:55,985
I like it. It's sort of...

1744
01:17:56,387 --> 01:18:01,063
I also like that the security
at Sandford Castle is quite lax.

1745
01:18:01,147 --> 01:18:02,216
- Yeah.
- You just jumped over a gate.

1746
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:04,537
Anyone can jump over a gate
and go and see a magic meeting.

1747
01:18:04,627 --> 01:18:06,743
A six-year-old could have done that.

1748
01:18:08,747 --> 01:18:12,706
You see Angel's notepad is already in place
to save his life later on.

1749
01:18:12,787 --> 01:18:14,106
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1750
01:18:14,187 --> 01:18:15,620
The greater good.

1751
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:19,700
This was one of the first ideas that we had.
I really like the...

1752
01:18:19,787 --> 01:18:23,097
Obviously, there's a Wicker Man vibe in it
in terms of...

1753
01:18:23,187 --> 01:18:26,896
Well, there's lots of great literature

1754
01:18:26,987 --> 01:18:29,376
where you have the town
against one person.

1755
01:18:29,467 --> 01:18:33,301
There's a great novel by Dashiell Hammett
called Nightmare Town.

1756
01:18:33,387 --> 01:18:35,742
- You know, H.P. Lovecraft...
- Dead & Buried.

1757
01:18:35,827 --> 01:18:37,863
Dead & Buried, Dennis Wheatley.

1758
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:42,099
The idea of, everybody is bad
and there's only one good guy.

1759
01:18:42,187 --> 01:18:43,779
So there's an element of that in terms of...

1760
01:18:43,867 --> 01:18:46,142
I always used to love that
about The Wicker Man,

1761
01:18:46,227 --> 01:18:49,936
that everybody was in on it.
But the other thing that really influenced us

1762
01:18:50,027 --> 01:18:52,222
was the twist
in Murder on the Orient Express.

1763
01:18:52,307 --> 01:18:54,946
I don't want to ruin it for people,
but, basically, they all did it.

1764
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:57,097
Hopefully you've watched the film
by this point.

1765
01:18:57,187 --> 01:18:59,382
But I just love that, in terms of...
I would love to know

1766
01:18:59,467 --> 01:19:01,901
at what point Agatha Christie
wrote Murder on the Orient Express

1767
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:06,060
when she thought, "Here's the twist.
They're all bad and they're all in on it."

1768
01:19:06,147 --> 01:19:07,136
So...

1769
01:19:07,227 --> 01:19:09,104
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

1770
01:19:09,187 --> 01:19:13,544
And like we said before, I just liked the idea
that all of the crimes are really petty.

1771
01:19:13,627 --> 01:19:17,415
This is like the letters page of the Daily Mail

1772
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:19,982
writ large and on the big screen.

1773
01:19:20,707 --> 01:19:22,459
It's England going to shit.

1774
01:19:22,587 --> 01:19:26,899
But also, both me and Simon
are from the country,

1775
01:19:27,507 --> 01:19:29,816
and I'd be lying if I said that my...

1776
01:19:29,907 --> 01:19:34,822
My mum, in her time, had had her age
incorrectly put in the paper,

1777
01:19:34,907 --> 01:19:39,423
- and it was of massive concern to her...
- Yeah, big deal.

1778
01:19:39,507 --> 01:19:44,945
...that she was quoted as being
four years older than she actually is.

1779
01:19:45,027 --> 01:19:47,143
And people's names being misspelled.

1780
01:19:47,227 --> 01:19:50,185
There was a guy at school...
We did a charity thing at school,

1781
01:19:50,267 --> 01:19:52,462
and one of the guys,
whose name was Simon Bardol,

1782
01:19:52,547 --> 01:19:54,503
was misspelled as Simon Barrol.

1783
01:19:54,587 --> 01:19:57,055
And, of course, being kids,
we never let him forget that.

1784
01:19:57,147 --> 01:19:59,103
We called him Simon Barrol
for about two years.

1785
01:19:59,187 --> 01:20:01,417
I was called Simon Regg in something once
and that stuck.

1786
01:20:01,507 --> 01:20:03,225
I think when you don't appear
in the paper that much,

1787
01:20:03,307 --> 01:20:07,459
if they mess up your one appearance,
then it's devastating.

1788
01:20:07,547 --> 01:20:10,539
Obviously, now we read lies
about ourselves all the time.

1789
01:20:10,627 --> 01:20:13,539
You're watching Hot Fuzz with Simon Regg.

1790
01:20:13,787 --> 01:20:15,459
And Dick Rost.

1791
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:18,859
Now, here's a great reveal,

1792
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,745
and it always chills me to the bone
when I see it,

1793
01:20:21,907 --> 01:20:23,465
which is, I think, a good sign.

1794
01:20:23,547 --> 01:20:29,179
- But Jim being bad is horrific for us.
- I know. How could...

1795
01:20:29,267 --> 01:20:32,339
Now, what's interesting
is we changed the name of...

1796
01:20:32,547 --> 01:20:34,378
It was Iris Butterman in the script.

1797
01:20:34,467 --> 01:20:36,219
And when Jim Broadbent came onboard,

1798
01:20:36,307 --> 01:20:39,982
he pointed out that, obviously,
he played Iris' husband...

1799
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:42,501
What he won the Oscar for,
for Best Supporting Actor.

1800
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:44,862
- Well, really...
- So it seemed very, very wrong

1801
01:20:44,947 --> 01:20:47,461
to call her Iris, you know, the dead wife.

1802
01:20:47,547 --> 01:20:51,506
Absolutely. And Jim had always been down
to play that role.

1803
01:20:51,587 --> 01:20:54,260
We'd always wanted him to, but we'd never
really put two and two together.

1804
01:20:54,347 --> 01:20:55,860
No, no.

1805
01:20:56,507 --> 01:21:01,342
The whole thing with the crusty jugglers...
Because I used to live in Somerset,

1806
01:21:01,427 --> 01:21:03,657
we'd have Glastonbury nearby,

1807
01:21:03,747 --> 01:21:05,942
and it would always be
around the Glastonbury Festival,

1808
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:10,305
there would always be an influx
of fire-eaters and jugglers.

1809
01:21:10,387 --> 01:21:13,140
And so there would be
a lot of consternation

1810
01:21:13,307 --> 01:21:16,344
about the June influx of crusty jugglers.

1811
01:21:16,427 --> 01:21:19,180
I'm not sure that term was ever used,
but that's how I'd describe them.

1812
01:21:19,267 --> 01:21:21,701
Stuart Wilson used to love...
That used to really make him laugh.

1813
01:21:21,787 --> 01:21:23,743
- That "crusty jugglers."
- "Crusty jugglers."

1814
01:21:23,827 --> 01:21:25,783
...who is going to have to come with us.

1815
01:21:26,587 --> 01:21:29,260
Wasn't it Bill Bailey who pointed out
that it should be...

1816
01:21:29,347 --> 01:21:32,339
Oh, yeah. It was originally a Nissan Cherry.

1817
01:21:32,427 --> 01:21:34,941
- And they said, "No, it's a Datsun Cherry."
- Yeah, yeah.

1818
01:21:35,027 --> 01:21:37,905
Because it changed over in...

1819
01:21:37,987 --> 01:21:40,023
Well, before the date that we mentioned.

1820
01:21:40,107 --> 01:21:42,496
You overpowered Lurch very easily there.

1821
01:21:42,587 --> 01:21:45,420
That was quite a technical move I did then.

1822
01:21:45,507 --> 01:21:47,975
I wish we'd have done
a bit more of a Jackie Chan move,

1823
01:21:48,067 --> 01:21:50,820
where you'd maybe spun round Nick
and kicked him in the face...

1824
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:52,977
- Oh, right.
...but that's for Hot Fuzz 2.

1825
01:21:53,187 --> 01:21:54,905
- Fuzz Harder.
- Fuzz Harder.

1826
01:21:54,987 --> 01:21:56,386
- Fuzz with a Vengeance.
- Fuzz Hotter.

1827
01:21:56,467 --> 01:21:57,866
Fuzz Hotter.

1828
01:21:57,947 --> 01:21:59,016
This was...

1829
01:21:59,107 --> 01:22:02,144
We had been through about three
different counties in as many shots.

1830
01:22:02,227 --> 01:22:05,105
We went from Wells to...

1831
01:22:05,187 --> 01:22:06,700
Where was that place, Waverley Abbey?

1832
01:22:06,787 --> 01:22:09,984
- Yeah, it was in Hertfordshire, wasn't it?
- Hertfordshire, into Essex.

1833
01:22:10,067 --> 01:22:12,501
This is in Copt Hall.

1834
01:22:12,587 --> 01:22:14,703
- "Dog muck."
- "Dog muck."

1835
01:22:15,587 --> 01:22:18,624
- How did they get the caravan into the cave?
- I don't know.

1836
01:22:18,707 --> 01:22:21,062
It's like getting a ship in a bottle.

1837
01:22:21,147 --> 01:22:23,377
- But it's not a cave.
- It's catacombs.

1838
01:22:23,467 --> 01:22:24,616
Catacombs.

1839
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:26,106
- This, we shot afterwards.
- Yeah.

1840
01:22:26,187 --> 01:22:29,543
The underage drinkers.
We were so pleased with their performance

1841
01:22:29,627 --> 01:22:31,777
that we brought them back
and we shot their dead bodies.

1842
01:22:31,867 --> 01:22:33,141
And killed them.

1843
01:22:33,227 --> 01:22:34,979
And we brought David Bradley back,

1844
01:22:35,067 --> 01:22:37,627
and we did a dummy of Ben
with maggots in his eyes.

1845
01:22:37,707 --> 01:22:40,301
There's Sergeant Popwell, who...

1846
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:42,617
There's Graham Low,
the living statue. Dead.

1847
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:46,825
You'll see in the deleted scenes,
there was a photograph of him on the wall,

1848
01:22:46,907 --> 01:22:49,626
and the person in the photograph
was the real Nick Angel.

1849
01:22:49,707 --> 01:22:52,062
And Sergeant Popwell
is a reference to Albert Popwell,

1850
01:22:52,147 --> 01:22:56,459
who is the character actor
who appears in every Dirty Harry film

1851
01:22:56,547 --> 01:22:58,777
playing a different black stereotype.

1852
01:22:59,027 --> 01:23:00,380
Fact fans.

1853
01:23:00,547 --> 01:23:02,060
Eventually becoming his partner in the end.

1854
01:23:02,147 --> 01:23:03,705
I love the fact that Nick can't look at you.

1855
01:23:03,787 --> 01:23:06,585
I love the fact Danny can't look at you
after he's done it.

1856
01:23:06,667 --> 01:23:09,306
It's kind of like the complicity, in terms of...

1857
01:23:09,387 --> 01:23:11,947
When you see what's happening,
it's the idea that

1858
01:23:12,027 --> 01:23:15,144
Angel knows he hasn't been stabbed
and knows that he has to play dead.

1859
01:23:15,227 --> 01:23:18,776
- It's like, "Oh, okay. I get it. It's ketchup."
- The end.

1860
01:23:19,187 --> 01:23:23,180
The music in this is great.

1861
01:23:23,947 --> 01:23:26,905
That was shot in the studio,
that pickup, wasn't it?

1862
01:23:27,187 --> 01:23:30,702
I remember when you were putting the film
together with a temporary soundtrack,

1863
01:23:30,787 --> 01:23:32,015
I remember thinking...

1864
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:33,745
'Cause you did such a great job,
I was thinking,

1865
01:23:33,827 --> 01:23:38,105
"My God, David's gonna have to
really push the boat out to match it,"

1866
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:40,826
and he just did, like, a thousand times over.

1867
01:23:40,907 --> 01:23:43,705
- Oh, yeah. The music in this is great.
- It's fantastic.

1868
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:46,981
Yeah, the red lighting in this

1869
01:23:47,067 --> 01:23:49,501
is obviously a bit of Tarantino and stuff
with the car boot,

1870
01:23:49,587 --> 01:23:52,420
but also, Goodfellas has that amazing scene

1871
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:54,975
lit by the car backlights.

1872
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:58,025
Somebody thought it was a reference
to Mulholland Dr.

1873
01:23:58,107 --> 01:24:00,667
Not specifically, no,
although I love Mulholland Dr.

1874
01:24:00,747 --> 01:24:02,021
It's a brilliant film.

1875
01:24:02,107 --> 01:24:04,462
Your performances in this scene
are so great.

1876
01:24:04,547 --> 01:24:07,664
I'm so proud of your performances,
especially 'cause this was a tough night.

1877
01:24:07,747 --> 01:24:09,863
Remember, this is when
most of the camera crew had left

1878
01:24:09,947 --> 01:24:12,177
- because we went over schedule.
- Yeah.

1879
01:24:12,267 --> 01:24:14,940
And we had
almost a completely new crew on this day

1880
01:24:15,027 --> 01:24:17,495
and it was very disconcerting, but...

1881
01:24:17,707 --> 01:24:19,937
What I love about this scene
is it's really dramatic

1882
01:24:20,027 --> 01:24:21,096
and you're really going for it,

1883
01:24:21,187 --> 01:24:23,462
but there's big laughs in it as well
like "skelingtons" and...

1884
01:24:23,547 --> 01:24:25,458
- Judge Judy.
- Judge Judy.

1885
01:24:25,547 --> 01:24:30,223
But I love the fact that your voice cracks.
"Blue fury."

1886
01:24:30,307 --> 01:24:31,740
"The blue fury!"

1887
01:24:31,827 --> 01:24:34,978
Now, it's worth pointing out that...
I've never seen the episode,

1888
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:38,218
but we didn't know
that Judge Judy is also in The Simpsons.

1889
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:39,706
- Oh, is it?
- Apparently,

1890
01:24:39,787 --> 01:24:41,186
although I've never
actually seen that episode.

1891
01:24:41,267 --> 01:24:42,859
I'm not even sure whether that's true.

1892
01:24:42,947 --> 01:24:45,666
The trouble is, pretty much with every joke
in the history of the world,

1893
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,339
somebody can say,
"Oh, that was on The Simpsons."

1894
01:24:47,427 --> 01:24:49,145
I know, 'cause they've done every joke ever.

1895
01:24:49,227 --> 01:24:52,424
The Simpsons, in 200 episodes,
has covered every joke known to man.

1896
01:24:52,507 --> 01:24:55,579
This is a nice shot coming up.
I'm really pleased with this shot.

1897
01:24:55,667 --> 01:24:57,623
Poor little Danny
disappearing into the shadows.

1898
01:24:57,707 --> 01:24:58,981
You can see the sun coming up.

1899
01:24:59,067 --> 01:25:00,864
We were shooting this
at, like, 5:00 in the morning.

1900
01:25:00,947 --> 01:25:03,984
It was so weird.
It's always so weird doing night shoots.

1901
01:25:04,067 --> 01:25:06,262
And that was on the day
we came back from Wells.

1902
01:25:06,347 --> 01:25:09,020
I followed Barry in my car,
'cause I'd driven to Wells,

1903
01:25:09,107 --> 01:25:11,575
and I spun out on a roundabout
and nearly didn't make it.

1904
01:25:11,667 --> 01:25:14,579
No film is complete
without a white lines montage.

1905
01:25:14,667 --> 01:25:18,785
See Blue Velvet. See Mad Max.
See Terminator 2.

1906
01:25:18,867 --> 01:25:20,300
You cannot go wrong
with the old white lines.

1907
01:25:25,547 --> 01:25:26,547
It's the road. It's the unknown path.

1908
01:25:26,547 --> 01:25:27,547
Now, this is Colin Michael Carmichael,

1909
01:25:27,547 --> 01:25:28,547
Nigel Tufnel himself.

1910
01:25:28,547 --> 01:25:29,536
It's amazing. I could not get over
how much he looked like Christopher Guest.

1911
01:25:30,587 --> 01:25:32,100
It was starting to freak me out.

1912
01:25:32,187 --> 01:25:35,304
Now, Robert Rodriguez did the music
for this bit,

1913
01:25:35,387 --> 01:25:39,699
which he did for a favour, for a laugh.
He didn't even see the rest of the film.

1914
01:25:39,787 --> 01:25:41,664
He just watched these two scenes.

1915
01:25:41,747 --> 01:25:42,896
It's also worth pointing out

1916
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:45,865
that that shot there is probably
one of the most complicated

1917
01:25:45,947 --> 01:25:48,586
in terms of the clearances.
We cleared all of those films.

1918
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:50,862
I also...
There's too much going on in this scene.

1919
01:25:50,947 --> 01:25:53,507
At this point onwards, when you say...

1920
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:58,059
When you say,
"This is something I have to do myself,"

1921
01:25:58,267 --> 01:26:03,546
from this point on, Simon ADRed,
looped, re-dubbed all of his dialogue

1922
01:26:03,627 --> 01:26:05,697
to make it sound
a bit more like an '80s action film.

1923
01:26:05,787 --> 01:26:08,426
So, from this point on,
even though we had good sound,

1924
01:26:08,507 --> 01:26:11,385
- I just liked the idea that you...
- 'Cause you can always tell, can't you?

1925
01:26:11,467 --> 01:26:14,186
- Even though it's brilliant...
- Close-mike dialogue like this.

1926
01:26:14,267 --> 01:26:15,382
It just sounds slightly...

1927
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:17,264
And you probably can't even
put your finger on why.

1928
01:26:17,347 --> 01:26:20,145
This is a nice digital effect, where the car
just suddenly appears behind him.

1929
01:26:20,227 --> 01:26:22,582
- Actually, weirdly, a special effect.
- The Jetta.

1930
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:23,861
Now, this was a difficult scene,

1931
01:26:23,947 --> 01:26:25,585
'cause we went and re-shot
more stuff for this,

1932
01:26:25,667 --> 01:26:27,385
and it went from being
my least favourite scene,

1933
01:26:27,467 --> 01:26:30,345
'cause it was a bit compromised,
to being probably my favourite.

1934
01:26:30,427 --> 01:26:32,418
Tell us what you did later, then.

1935
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:34,261
That's new.

1936
01:26:35,867 --> 01:26:36,982
That's new.

1937
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:39,023
- It's literally just snippets.
- Little bits and bobs.

1938
01:26:39,107 --> 01:26:40,335
This is old.

1939
01:26:40,427 --> 01:26:43,703
We put in a sign. That sign
is a special effect, behind. That's new.

1940
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:44,776
Is that a digital sign?

1941
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,459
- Yeah, it's a digital sign.
- Fucking incredible.

1942
01:26:46,547 --> 01:26:49,380
This is all new, the stuff here.
And then the shot with...

1943
01:26:50,147 --> 01:26:52,741
Where the foot goes
into Maria Charles' face, that was new.

1944
01:26:52,827 --> 01:26:54,738
We did the old Jackie Chan trick of...

1945
01:26:54,827 --> 01:26:59,059
The stuntman had a trouser leg on his arm
and a shoe on his hand,

1946
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:01,024
which is how they do kick shots
in Jackie Chan.

1947
01:27:01,107 --> 01:27:03,063
- Here's Robert again.
- This is Robert's music again,

1948
01:27:03,147 --> 01:27:04,580
which sounds amazing.

1949
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:07,977
It sounds like the trailers
for Extreme Prejudice or something.

1950
01:27:08,347 --> 01:27:10,542
I love this montage so much.

1951
01:27:11,867 --> 01:27:15,223
I'm such a 14-year-old boy,

1952
01:27:15,307 --> 01:27:18,265
but this kind of stuff gets me hard,
I'm sorry to say.

1953
01:27:18,347 --> 01:27:20,861
Flash zooms and guns.
I know, it's so obvious.

1954
01:27:20,947 --> 01:27:22,858
I apologise, but it gets me hard.

1955
01:27:22,947 --> 01:27:25,142
And as I said in the other commentary,

1956
01:27:25,227 --> 01:27:27,297
- you made me do all of that, didn't you?
- Yeah.

1957
01:27:27,387 --> 01:27:29,423
- That was your hands.
- And I was happy you did.

1958
01:27:29,507 --> 01:27:32,067
Oh, see, listen to this.
It's like Robocop's footsteps,

1959
01:27:32,147 --> 01:27:35,025
the idea that the footsteps
are really thumping.

1960
01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:37,541
So Robert Rodriguez
had only seen these two scenes,

1961
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,504
and only the other day
did he see the whole film

1962
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,100
and saw how it all fit together.

1963
01:27:41,187 --> 01:27:42,415
I'll tell them you'll ring them back.

1964
01:27:45,547 --> 01:27:47,378
- Well, that's funny.
- What's that?

1965
01:27:47,467 --> 01:27:49,059
I didn't know we had a mounted division.

1966
01:27:49,147 --> 01:27:51,786
This always gets a bigger laugh in the UK
than it does in the States,

1967
01:27:59,867 --> 01:28:00,856
'cause, obviously, two Bill Baileys
has more currency in the UK.

1968
01:28:00,907 --> 01:28:01,862
Double Bailey.

1969
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:03,226
Because people in America don't know
that there isn't two Bill Baileys.

1970
01:28:03,307 --> 01:28:07,186
Yeah, he could be like those twin actors
that are in Gremlins 2 and Terminator 2.

1971
01:28:08,067 --> 01:28:09,102
Whatever happened to those guys?

1972
01:28:09,187 --> 01:28:11,018
Haven't seen them
since Good Morning, Vietnam.

1973
01:28:11,107 --> 01:28:14,497
- They're like the American Kevin and Nick.
- I think the twin ship dried up.

1974
01:28:14,587 --> 01:28:17,977
The Zito is a reference to Joseph Zito,

1975
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:22,060
who trash fans will know
directed Invasion U.S.A.

1976
01:28:22,147 --> 01:28:24,058
- Classic Chuck Norris.
- God, I didn't know that.

1977
01:28:24,147 --> 01:28:25,785
He directed Red Scorpion.

1978
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:28,745
He also directed
Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter.

1979
01:28:28,827 --> 01:28:30,101
Edgar, you are...

1980
01:28:30,187 --> 01:28:32,747
Do you know what? As well,
I didn't know about the Treacher thing,

1981
01:28:32,827 --> 01:28:34,624
about that being
The Siege of Trencher's Farm.

1982
01:28:34,707 --> 01:28:36,982
Oh, yeah. A reference to Straw Dogs,
the original novel.

1983
01:28:37,067 --> 01:28:40,696
I just thought you named it after
Bill Treacher, who played Arthur Fowler.

1984
01:28:41,267 --> 01:28:42,905
We got that shot of the sign in there

1985
01:28:42,987 --> 01:28:45,660
so we could set it up
for coming through the pub window.

1986
01:28:45,747 --> 01:28:48,978
You know what's weird? That shot of Stuart,
it looks like he's Monsieur Hulot.

1987
01:28:49,067 --> 01:28:50,659
It suddenly looks like we're in France.

1988
01:28:50,747 --> 01:28:52,783
The background looks very French
all of a sudden.

1989
01:28:52,867 --> 01:28:57,702
I love Lorraine.
Her little confusion here is great.

1990
01:28:57,787 --> 01:28:59,823
And you put a little breath in
in ADR, which is nice.

1991
01:28:59,907 --> 01:29:01,499
Tim Barlow is really pissed off.

1992
01:29:01,587 --> 01:29:03,020
Listen to this music.

1993
01:29:03,107 --> 01:29:07,783
I remember when we heard
the orchestra performing this,

1994
01:29:07,867 --> 01:29:09,016
and it was such a rush.

1995
01:29:09,107 --> 01:29:12,224
I was so jealous,
'cause I was filming and I couldn't come.

1996
01:29:12,307 --> 01:29:13,740
Oh, it was amazing.

1997
01:29:14,067 --> 01:29:15,386
This...

1998
01:29:16,707 --> 01:29:19,267
You can't go wrong
with a Good, the Bad and the Ugly-style

1999
01:29:19,347 --> 01:29:21,417
cutting around all the protagonists.

2000
01:29:21,507 --> 01:29:23,975
I like the idea there's too many protagonists.

2001
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:26,297
- It goes on slightly too long.
- I love the way they break,

2002
01:29:26,387 --> 01:29:28,947
Paul and Trevor and Elizabeth,

2003
01:29:29,027 --> 01:29:30,540
the way they all run off
in different directions.

2004
01:29:30,627 --> 01:29:31,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2005
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:33,978
They're so cartoony.

2006
01:29:34,987 --> 01:29:37,376
Here's a bit of you re-dubbing yourself.

2007
01:29:39,067 --> 01:29:40,216
"Morning."

2008
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:43,225
And the first one to break...

2009
01:29:43,307 --> 01:29:46,265
That's what that line earlier on about,
"Guilty people make the first move,"

2010
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:49,896
is that Treacher gets his gun out before...

2011
01:29:50,027 --> 01:29:53,417
You know, they could have just stood there,
but Treacher actually breaks.

2012
01:29:53,507 --> 01:29:55,145
Guilty people make the first move.

2013
01:29:55,227 --> 01:29:57,536
The Thermos in the...

2014
01:29:57,987 --> 01:29:59,625
The Thermos and the guns in their basket

2015
01:29:59,707 --> 01:30:02,619
was a little nod to Robert Rodriguez,
like, Desperado-style.

2016
01:30:02,707 --> 01:30:06,097
I like to think that Amanda Paver's Thermos
is also a bomb.

2017
01:30:08,467 --> 01:30:12,062
This was shot in Wells marketplace.
We didn't really have this place locked off,

2018
01:30:12,147 --> 01:30:13,865
so any of these shots,

2019
01:30:13,947 --> 01:30:15,938
around the other side of the camera,

2020
01:30:16,027 --> 01:30:18,018
there's lots of school kids
and old ladies watching,

2021
01:30:18,107 --> 01:30:19,142
which was quite surreal.

2022
01:30:19,227 --> 01:30:23,379
Now, one of my regrets is that we didn't
have a shot of the hoodies grabbing her

2023
01:30:23,467 --> 01:30:25,697
and pulling her down,
'cause that's what's supposed to happen.

2024
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,062
The idea is she gets yanked back,
and I think...

2025
01:30:28,147 --> 01:30:31,935
Could have had a little hoodie stuntman
grabbing her.

2026
01:30:32,747 --> 01:30:36,296
So it almost becomes
a little bit Children's Film Foundation, this,

2027
01:30:36,387 --> 01:30:38,298
because you're not killing anybody.

2028
01:30:38,387 --> 01:30:42,665
You're orchestrating
a bunch of slip-ups, aren't you?

2029
01:30:42,747 --> 01:30:44,942
- Our idea was that...
- He's not a killer.

2030
01:30:45,027 --> 01:30:49,464
...Angel maintains moral superiority
at all times.

2031
01:30:49,547 --> 01:30:51,697
He's like Batman.
He never takes a human life.

2032
01:30:51,787 --> 01:30:55,097
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was the idea of doing...

2033
01:30:56,027 --> 01:30:58,416
It's very similar to Uma Thurman in Kill Bill,

2034
01:30:58,507 --> 01:31:02,261
where she doesn't really kill anybody
in the House of Blue Leaves.

2035
01:31:02,347 --> 01:31:04,338
- She takes off their limbs.
- Their limbs.

2036
01:31:04,427 --> 01:31:05,985
Apart from the guy
whose head she cuts in half.

2037
01:31:06,067 --> 01:31:07,898
Yeah, he's dead. He's definitely dead.

2038
01:31:07,987 --> 01:31:10,660
Greg and Sheree here, blasting back.

2039
01:31:11,107 --> 01:31:13,621
I love that shot when the glass falls down.

2040
01:31:13,707 --> 01:31:16,346
This was fun to do.
This was so much fun to do.

2041
01:31:16,827 --> 01:31:19,341
Is there anything you've done
with the frame speed in this?

2042
01:31:19,427 --> 01:31:23,466
- 'Cause there's a quality to it that looks...
- It's like a hand-crank camera.

2043
01:31:23,547 --> 01:31:25,822
Tony Scott uses it a lot
in Man on Fire and Domino.

2044
01:31:25,907 --> 01:31:28,421
You basically control the speed
of the camera yourself,

2045
01:31:28,507 --> 01:31:30,816
so you get
these really irregular patterns, so...

2046
01:31:30,907 --> 01:31:32,738
I really like...
There's a shot here in a second... Yeah.

2047
01:31:32,827 --> 01:31:35,295
You saw it there,
where Trevor just disappears.

2048
01:31:37,387 --> 01:31:38,456
Bingo.

2049
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:41,580
Shooting out the brachial nerve,
taking out the shoulder, disarming them.

2050
01:31:41,667 --> 01:31:45,103
Nice, which is hard to do with a shotgun,
which is basically a spread weapon.

2051
01:31:45,187 --> 01:31:47,382
- Here she comes.
- Oh, I love this bit.

2052
01:31:47,707 --> 01:31:50,016
- This was one of my favourite bits to shoot.
- Yes.

2053
01:31:50,107 --> 01:31:52,667
Billie looks so at home
with this machine gun.

2054
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:55,104
She's such a versatile actress.

2055
01:31:56,187 --> 01:31:57,336
She's amazing.

2056
01:31:57,747 --> 01:31:58,975
Seventy-two years old,

2057
01:31:59,067 --> 01:32:03,060
and yet somehow looked like
she was born to fire a gun like that.

2058
01:32:04,027 --> 01:32:07,258
Billie Whitelaw is...
Eric as well. Look at this here. It's crazy.

2059
01:32:07,347 --> 01:32:10,737
You've only seen Eric awake, I think,
once in the film already.

2060
01:32:12,267 --> 01:32:15,782
And when you finally see him in action,
he's a master swordsman.

2061
01:32:15,867 --> 01:32:19,303
It's like the major from Fawlty Towers
has come back with a vengeance.

2062
01:32:19,387 --> 01:32:21,139
"My bloody hip!"

2063
01:32:21,227 --> 01:32:23,263
Stop! Stop this, please!

2064
01:32:23,347 --> 01:32:25,258
- There's Paul.
- Paul Freeman.

2065
01:32:25,987 --> 01:32:28,706
It's not often you get to see
a kick-ass action scene

2066
01:32:28,787 --> 01:32:30,584
in front of a National Trust shop, is it?

2067
01:32:30,667 --> 01:32:33,056
Absolutely. I think it could be a first.

2068
01:32:33,587 --> 01:32:36,420
- I think Paul looks good in a cassock.
- He looks great.

2069
01:32:36,507 --> 01:32:38,737
I may not be a man of God, Reverend...

2070
01:32:38,827 --> 01:32:41,102
- This is all ADRed.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2071
01:32:42,147 --> 01:32:43,899
"Fuck off, Grasshopper."

2072
01:32:44,187 --> 01:32:46,576
You know what I think?
In retrospect, he probably should have said,

2073
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:49,500
"Oh, fuck the police,"
a little N. W.A. reference.

2074
01:32:49,587 --> 01:32:52,226
Although, unfortunately,
the film Torque with Ice Cube

2075
01:32:52,307 --> 01:32:53,706
had already beaten us to that reference.

2076
01:32:53,787 --> 01:32:54,936
I like, "Fuck off, Grasshopper."

2077
01:32:55,027 --> 01:32:56,938
That was a very early line
that we came up with.

2078
01:32:57,027 --> 01:32:59,257
I know. It was when he was a Buddhist.

2079
01:32:59,347 --> 01:33:02,657
I think we kept it 'cause we liked
it being somebody who's virtuous

2080
01:33:02,747 --> 01:33:04,783
and droning on,
"Oh, fuck off, Grasshopper."

2081
01:33:04,867 --> 01:33:08,018
Yeah, with his spiritual theory.

2082
01:33:08,107 --> 01:33:11,577
I like the endless procession
of hostage situations.

2083
01:33:11,787 --> 01:33:15,575
One of these action films would have
maybe two of these in a row,

2084
01:33:15,667 --> 01:33:18,579
but I liked the idea
that you have three or four.

2085
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:21,261
Like, every baddy
gets their hostage face-off.

2086
01:33:21,347 --> 01:33:24,419
Well, that's the thing, is when...
I love that. It's great.

2087
01:33:24,507 --> 01:33:26,304
Another great bit from Stuart.

2088
01:33:26,387 --> 01:33:28,662
The bit when Frank takes Danny hostage,

2089
01:33:28,747 --> 01:33:31,500
that, "Oh, pack it in!"
It's like, "Enough is enough."

2090
01:33:31,587 --> 01:33:35,978
- For fuck's sake.
- "Pack it in, Frank, you silly barstool."

2091
01:33:36,067 --> 01:33:37,898
If you see, he blows his own toe off

2092
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:39,625
and then he treads on his toe
with his other foot,

2093
01:33:39,707 --> 01:33:41,538
which is particularly nasty.

2094
01:33:41,827 --> 01:33:44,216
You're a doctor, deal with it.

2095
01:33:44,307 --> 01:33:45,626
"Yeah, motherfucker."

2096
01:33:45,707 --> 01:33:47,379
It's good, actually, with Stuart falling over.

2097
01:33:47,467 --> 01:33:49,423
I really wanted to do
that Inspector Clouseau,

2098
01:33:49,507 --> 01:33:51,543
Return of the Pink Panther-style...

2099
01:33:52,547 --> 01:33:53,821
What? Do it again to do it himself?

2100
01:33:53,907 --> 01:33:56,626
I did. I got Stuart to do it himself.
He did his own slow-motion sound.

2101
01:33:56,707 --> 01:33:57,901
- Here we go.
- Now, if you look there,

2102
01:33:57,987 --> 01:34:01,343
there's a sign that says,
"2 shooters 4 the price of 1."

2103
01:34:02,307 --> 01:34:04,343
A little visual and verbal joke.

2104
01:34:05,787 --> 01:34:08,779
More great fruit machine stuff.
And here we come.

2105
01:34:08,867 --> 01:34:11,779
I love this music here.
This makes me laugh so much.

2106
01:34:12,547 --> 01:34:16,938
Never has so much ammunition been
expended without actually hitting anybody.

2107
01:34:17,507 --> 01:34:23,377
I think we wanted to take the record
from John Woo

2108
01:34:23,467 --> 01:34:25,059
for people not getting shot at.

2109
01:34:25,147 --> 01:34:27,263
Actually, that's not true.
John Woo shoots a lot of people.

2110
01:34:27,347 --> 01:34:29,815
Let's say James Bond,
or let's say the A-Team, in fact.

2111
01:34:29,907 --> 01:34:33,217
Yeah. No, the A-Team were hamstrung
by their inability to hit people.

2112
01:34:33,307 --> 01:34:34,535
The kings of...

2113
01:34:34,627 --> 01:34:37,539
There are no squibs in The A-Team.
A squib-free show.

2114
01:34:37,627 --> 01:34:39,936
Now, that hole in the table, was that there?

2115
01:34:40,027 --> 01:34:42,780
- Because there's more damage...
- There's a couple of digital holes.

2116
01:34:42,867 --> 01:34:44,778
I just love the fact
that you don't get hit at all.

2117
01:34:44,867 --> 01:34:46,300
- That's great.
- But when you pop up...

2118
01:34:46,387 --> 01:34:48,901
The idea when you pop up
and you hear that noise

2119
01:34:48,987 --> 01:34:50,978
- is it's like an extra life.
- That's right, yeah.

2120
01:34:51,067 --> 01:34:53,945
It's literally like he died
and he got a "continue."

2121
01:34:54,027 --> 01:34:57,542
Well, we kind of wanted it to have
the video-game feel of Hard-Boiled,

2122
01:34:57,627 --> 01:35:00,380
even to the point where they say,
"We're going after the big boss."

2123
01:35:00,467 --> 01:35:03,698
Oh, yeah. It's like different levels.
It's like, "Here's the marketplace level,

2124
01:35:03,787 --> 01:35:05,857
"here's the pub level,
here's the supermarket."

2125
01:35:05,947 --> 01:35:09,098
Yeah. And not cynically so it could be
turned into a video game, either.

2126
01:35:09,187 --> 01:35:12,145
It was entirely because
a lot of those films do have that structure.

2127
01:35:12,227 --> 01:35:14,422
Although, if any game manufacturers
are listening,

2128
01:35:14,507 --> 01:35:19,297
we would like to make it into a video game
'cause we'll make lots of money. Goodbye.

2129
01:35:19,387 --> 01:35:22,345
- This is Hot Fuzz.
- I love the lighting in this scene.

2130
01:35:22,707 --> 01:35:24,140
This is really nicely lit.

2131
01:35:24,227 --> 01:35:29,301
I just like the continual removing
of ocular blockages

2132
01:35:29,467 --> 01:35:31,298
like visors, glasses...

2133
01:35:31,387 --> 01:35:33,423
Everybody takes something off
in this scene.

2134
01:35:33,507 --> 01:35:35,384
I want to just go back to the bear trap thing.

2135
01:35:35,467 --> 01:35:38,061
Obviously, the bear trap
is a little nod to Straw Dogs,

2136
01:35:38,147 --> 01:35:41,981
but also, you can't go wrong
with blood splatting the lens.

2137
01:35:42,067 --> 01:35:44,865
It's a very clever device, that,
because it breaks the fourth wall

2138
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:47,222
and employs a kind of documentary realism

2139
01:35:47,307 --> 01:35:49,867
in something which is essentially
not documentary-realistic.

2140
01:35:49,947 --> 01:35:51,460
It's a real cheat, but a very clever one.

2141
01:35:51,547 --> 01:35:54,744
Well, it's funny.
I think Saving Private Ryan repopularised it,

2142
01:35:54,827 --> 01:35:57,978
but I always remember, as a kid,
watching the film Earthquake,

2143
01:35:58,067 --> 01:36:00,342
and there's a scene
where people fall down in a lift.

2144
01:36:00,427 --> 01:36:01,940
And to show that they all get splatted,

2145
01:36:02,027 --> 01:36:04,825
cartoon blood, like the Batman TVseries,
splats the lens,

2146
01:36:04,907 --> 01:36:07,580
and I always used to think,
"That's just weird."

2147
01:36:09,547 --> 01:36:13,460
I like the fact
that Saxon eventually stops barking.

2148
01:36:13,547 --> 01:36:14,582
Saxon...

2149
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:18,819
He licks his lips.
As soon as Karl turns, Saxon follows suit.

2150
01:36:18,907 --> 01:36:20,465
I reckon he's got something there.

2151
01:36:20,547 --> 01:36:21,866
Here we go.

2152
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,215
"He's right, Dad."

2153
01:36:26,227 --> 01:36:29,503
We should re-dub it
with Saxon saying some of the lines, going,

2154
01:36:29,587 --> 01:36:32,420
- "I agree."
- "He's right, you know."

2155
01:36:33,027 --> 01:36:34,221
Like Meathead.

2156
01:36:34,307 --> 01:36:36,025
- Like Meathead from Sudden lmpact.
- Sudden lmpact.

2157
01:36:36,107 --> 01:36:39,622
He's our favourite police dog
other than Samson Saxon.

2158
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:42,175
Paddy De Niroed it up to the hilt there.

2159
01:36:42,267 --> 01:36:46,385
Now watch out for this amazing
pantomime roar by Jim Broadbent.

2160
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:47,786
Look at this.

2161
01:36:49,227 --> 01:36:54,426
We put on a lion roar on that shot.
It makes me laugh.

2162
01:36:54,907 --> 01:36:57,580
- Why don't they run after him?
- I don't know.

2163
01:36:57,667 --> 01:37:00,101
Clearly it's time to go
to the supermarket now.

2164
01:37:01,027 --> 01:37:04,337
I love that, the empty shot with the smoke.
The dry ice.

2165
01:37:10,107 --> 01:37:11,107
And also, "They'll come round again"
was a callback

2166
01:37:11,107 --> 01:37:12,107
to what Jim says about the hoodies
in the first scene with Weaver.

2167
01:37:12,107 --> 01:37:14,541
- Somerfield. God bless Somerfield.
- I know. That makes me laugh.

2168
01:37:14,627 --> 01:37:17,903
All that amped-up
Jon Spencer-Tony Scott nonsense,

2169
01:37:17,987 --> 01:37:19,818
and you've got "customer parking only."

2170
01:37:19,947 --> 01:37:21,460
I was very...

2171
01:37:21,547 --> 01:37:23,663
We've come across clearance issues before

2172
01:37:23,747 --> 01:37:26,261
and come to blows with people,

2173
01:37:26,347 --> 01:37:31,546
but maximum respect to Somerfield
for allowing us to have their store in the film

2174
01:37:31,627 --> 01:37:33,777
with a murderous psychopath as a manager.

2175
01:37:33,867 --> 01:37:38,304
I used to work at Somerfield's,
and for five years it was my Saturday job.

2176
01:37:38,387 --> 01:37:42,938
I have worked in this... This is the one.
I have cleaned that car park in my time.

2177
01:37:43,027 --> 01:37:44,585
I have picked up nappies

2178
01:37:44,667 --> 01:37:47,545
and I have collected all the trolleys
from that car park,

2179
01:37:47,627 --> 01:37:50,141
so I know every square inch of that car park.

2180
01:37:50,227 --> 01:37:53,025
What an amazing coming-home for you
to do this film here.

2181
01:37:53,107 --> 01:37:55,746
I mean, honestly, to be making
a multi-million dollar movie

2182
01:37:55,827 --> 01:37:59,024
in a car park that you once cleaned,
I mean, that is poetic.

2183
01:37:59,107 --> 01:38:02,702
We're back in Hounslow now,
back in the interior.

2184
01:38:03,707 --> 01:38:07,336
Paul Herbert, our stunt coordinator,
did a great job doing these sequences,

2185
01:38:07,427 --> 01:38:10,624
because he basically tried to do
as much of it with you and Rory as possible

2186
01:38:10,707 --> 01:38:11,935
so it'd look more realistic.

2187
01:38:12,027 --> 01:38:14,302
There's obviously a lot of stunt-doubling
in there in places.

2188
01:38:14,387 --> 01:38:17,538
We were left with no choice on this day

2189
01:38:17,627 --> 01:38:20,744
because Rowley, my stunt double,
broke his collarbone in the morning.

2190
01:38:20,827 --> 01:38:23,660
- That's right, on the rehearsal.
- On the rehearsal for the fight.

2191
01:38:23,747 --> 01:38:27,342
Then I had to do it all by myself.
But, obviously, with Paul looking after me...

2192
01:38:27,427 --> 01:38:29,224
And Nick was your stunt double,
wasn't he, in this?

2193
01:38:29,307 --> 01:38:31,298
Yeah. Nick then took over.

2194
01:38:31,387 --> 01:38:34,185
I have to say, as well,
with the action in this film,

2195
01:38:34,347 --> 01:38:37,259
we did as much as we possibly could
for the budget.

2196
01:38:37,347 --> 01:38:41,625
And it's worth pointing out
that for one Miami Vice or Bad Boys II,

2197
01:38:41,707 --> 01:38:44,779
- you could get about nine Hot Fuzzes.
- Yeah.

2198
01:38:44,867 --> 01:38:47,381
Now, the thing here with "the Bolognese..."

2199
01:38:47,467 --> 01:38:49,298
The Bolognese line came up on the day.

2200
01:38:49,387 --> 01:38:51,503
We came up with that
and went and told Paddy to say it.

2201
01:38:51,587 --> 01:38:53,942
The interesting thing
with the deli counter there

2202
01:38:54,027 --> 01:38:56,097
is that I really wanted to smash that glass,

2203
01:38:56,187 --> 01:38:59,816
but because it was curved,
it was really expensive to replace,

2204
01:38:59,907 --> 01:39:00,896
and so we thought...

2205
01:39:00,987 --> 01:39:02,705
I was so annoyed
that we couldn't smash the glass,

2206
01:39:02,787 --> 01:39:05,347
so what we did is
we put on the sound of it being bullet-proof.

2207
01:39:05,427 --> 01:39:08,464
So I like the idea that Skinner,
in his preparation for the apocalypse,

2208
01:39:08,547 --> 01:39:10,344
would've put a bullet-proof deli counter
in there.

2209
01:39:10,427 --> 01:39:13,021
- In the butchers'.
- So you hear the noise of it going...

2210
01:39:13,427 --> 01:39:16,942
- That was a nice Jackie Chan-style stunt.
- Yeah, yeah.

2211
01:39:17,507 --> 01:39:20,385
I really wanted to blow up this deli counter,
which we eventually do.

2212
01:39:20,467 --> 01:39:23,186
I think one of the things that is...

2213
01:39:23,787 --> 01:39:26,062
I won't say I find it frustrating, but I think,

2214
01:39:26,147 --> 01:39:29,617
because I think you did such a good job
of mounting the action scenes,

2215
01:39:29,707 --> 01:39:33,143
it wasn't ever appreciated,
just what you did for what you had.

2216
01:39:33,227 --> 01:39:34,216
Do you know what I mean?

2217
01:39:34,307 --> 01:39:37,299
Well, it wasn't the biggest budget
in the world.

2218
01:39:37,387 --> 01:39:40,584
Basically, everything we shot is onscreen.

2219
01:39:40,867 --> 01:39:42,425
- Yeah.
- I love this little run here.

2220
01:39:42,507 --> 01:39:45,499
That's a real Michael Bay moment
of you running slowly.

2221
01:39:45,587 --> 01:39:50,945
I'd like to see a slow-mo cleaver
just going over my head as I went down.

2222
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:55,020
There's a few digital cleavers in here.
Here's a digital cleaver coming up,

2223
01:39:55,107 --> 01:39:56,665
after he says, "Shame."

2224
01:39:56,747 --> 01:39:59,898
Oh, no. It's gone. There's one.
That's a digital one. And another one here.

2225
01:39:59,987 --> 01:40:01,056
There you go.

2226
01:40:01,147 --> 01:40:04,298
Yeah, we added extra knives and stuff
to make it seem a bit more dangerous.

2227
01:40:04,387 --> 01:40:06,059
I love this. This is real Marvel comics.

2228
01:40:06,147 --> 01:40:07,341
"Idea."

2229
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:10,227
That's real Spider-Man think-bubble stuff.

2230
01:40:10,307 --> 01:40:13,344
I love the two shots of the Andes
on either side.

2231
01:40:13,427 --> 01:40:15,418
There's something really documentary-ish.
These two.

2232
01:40:15,507 --> 01:40:16,826
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2233
01:40:16,907 --> 01:40:19,137
Paddy's white teeth
against his red face is great.

2234
01:40:19,227 --> 01:40:21,218
Now, basically, with the first take...

2235
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:24,822
You guys had got so pissed off running
up and down this thing on the first take,

2236
01:40:24,907 --> 01:40:27,501
when it came to actually hit the thing,
you smashed the glass,

2237
01:40:27,587 --> 01:40:29,817
which I was secretly very happy about.

2238
01:40:29,907 --> 01:40:33,217
I think Rafe was quite annoyed that day,
'cause he wanted to get somewhere.

2239
01:40:33,307 --> 01:40:34,660
We've discussed this.

2240
01:40:34,747 --> 01:40:36,499
- This is great.
- I love this bit.

2241
01:40:37,307 --> 01:40:41,459
Now, you did something in the edit
to amp that up between times I saw it...

2242
01:40:41,547 --> 01:40:43,742
You cut out all the music
just before the hit, basically.

2243
01:40:43,827 --> 01:40:47,137
You have all the music building up,
and then you cut the sound out.

2244
01:40:47,227 --> 01:40:49,377
- Fruit attack!
- There's digital fruit here as well.

2245
01:40:49,467 --> 01:40:52,027
You see a couple of digital pineapples
and things going through shot.

2246
01:40:52,107 --> 01:40:53,825
- Digi-fruit?
- Digi-fruits.

2247
01:40:53,907 --> 01:40:56,785
That's digital as well,
that big splat behind them.

2248
01:40:57,027 --> 01:40:59,780
I liked the fact that he would open fire
on some unarmed shelf stackers.

2249
01:40:59,867 --> 01:41:01,266
I know. It always gets a laugh, as well,

2250
01:41:01,347 --> 01:41:04,384
that he just fires a fucking M1 rifle
at some kids.

2251
01:41:05,427 --> 01:41:07,657
No '80s action film is complete
without somebody kicking a door down.

2252
01:41:07,747 --> 01:41:09,419
- Absolutely.
- Usually Schwarzenegger going,

2253
01:41:09,507 --> 01:41:10,906
"Knock, knock."

2254
01:41:16,147 --> 01:41:17,136
Or jumping...

2255
01:41:17,187 --> 01:41:18,142
Quite a lot of arm-waving, though.
I might've...

2256
01:41:18,187 --> 01:41:19,336
I know. That seems like a stuntman special,
to do lots of arm-waving.

2257
01:41:19,427 --> 01:41:21,383
The same that stuntmen,
when they do driving scenes,

2258
01:41:21,467 --> 01:41:23,298
always cover their faces

2259
01:41:23,387 --> 01:41:26,379
- with their hands.
- Yeah, it's almost instinctive, isn't it?

2260
01:41:26,667 --> 01:41:27,941
This was so much fun,

2261
01:41:28,027 --> 01:41:29,858
- running around that corner.
- It's so loud. I love it.

2262
01:41:29,947 --> 01:41:31,824
My mum and my sister were there that day.

2263
01:41:31,907 --> 01:41:33,420
It's so ridiculous.

2264
01:41:33,547 --> 01:41:34,866
"Punch that shit."

2265
01:41:35,747 --> 01:41:36,782
There they are.

2266
01:41:36,867 --> 01:41:39,984
- My mum, Peter Wild...
- Mr Peter Wild and my mum.

2267
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:42,697
The Village of the Year officials.

2268
01:41:43,907 --> 01:41:46,102
Quite a few people pointed out
with this chase,

2269
01:41:46,187 --> 01:41:47,745
the funny thing about it
being an English chase.

2270
01:41:47,827 --> 01:41:50,102
Not only have you got a chase
with two Astras,

2271
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:52,462
but because it's the UK,
they're driving in a straight line.

2272
01:41:52,547 --> 01:41:56,301
Just driving down, endlessly down,
a country lane.

2273
01:41:56,947 --> 01:42:00,178
- Astra Diesels.
- Astra Diesels in action.

2274
01:42:00,267 --> 01:42:02,497
My one regret with the budget here, as well,

2275
01:42:02,587 --> 01:42:04,464
is there should've been
a bit more breaking glass.

2276
01:42:04,547 --> 01:42:07,903
I think if we could've afforded to
and we had the time,

2277
01:42:07,987 --> 01:42:10,376
I would've shot that windscreen to shit.

2278
01:42:10,627 --> 01:42:13,016
Yeah, and smashed the sirens.

2279
01:42:13,107 --> 01:42:16,065
You do see the siren smash, though,
in a second. Digital. Look at this.

2280
01:42:16,147 --> 01:42:17,580
Coming up, you see...

2281
01:42:17,667 --> 01:42:20,386
- I really like that, actually.
- There goes the siren.

2282
01:42:21,267 --> 01:42:23,258
But I like this bit here.
This is a nice stunt coming up.

2283
01:42:23,347 --> 01:42:25,417
- Swan.
- Now, that's a real swan there,

2284
01:42:25,507 --> 01:42:28,817
but it looks like a puppet.
That was a real swan, amazingly.

2285
01:42:28,947 --> 01:42:33,099
Here's little Alexander,
playing Aaron A. Aaronson.

2286
01:42:34,067 --> 01:42:35,341
This was fun to shoot.

2287
01:42:35,427 --> 01:42:38,703
This is basically shot through the air
with a big cannon,

2288
01:42:38,787 --> 01:42:40,664
like an air ram thing.

2289
01:42:40,747 --> 01:42:44,865
We smashed up two Astras doing that.

2290
01:42:47,267 --> 01:42:50,259
We did it twice.
It never actually turned over, did it, fully?

2291
01:42:50,347 --> 01:42:52,815
I know. I said to the guy with the air ram,

2292
01:42:52,907 --> 01:42:56,900
I said, "If you hit the first car
with the second car..."

2293
01:42:56,987 --> 01:42:58,340
It was like a game of car bowls.

2294
01:42:58,427 --> 01:43:01,897
I said I'd give him 100 quid
if he could hit the other Astra, but he didn't.

2295
01:43:01,987 --> 01:43:05,343
- I would've given him 100 quid, as well.
- Unlike some people we know.

2296
01:43:05,427 --> 01:43:08,817
This is a classic hostage situation.

2297
01:43:08,907 --> 01:43:11,546
Any cop film worth its salt will end in a...

2298
01:43:13,467 --> 01:43:17,346
Dirty Harry ends in a killer-and-kid situation.

2299
01:43:17,427 --> 01:43:18,416
Scorpio.

2300
01:43:18,507 --> 01:43:20,577
But I like the fact
the kid is really quick-thinking.

2301
01:43:20,667 --> 01:43:23,101
He's not scared at all.
He just bites his hand immediately.

2302
01:43:23,187 --> 01:43:24,939
Aaron A. Aaronson,
played by Alexander King,

2303
01:43:25,027 --> 01:43:26,176
a very studious young actor.

2304
01:43:26,267 --> 01:43:27,416
He's one tough nut.

2305
01:43:27,507 --> 01:43:29,737
- He's a tough ginger nut.
- He was always reading.

2306
01:43:29,827 --> 01:43:33,263
I'm really pleased with this punch-up,
actually. It feels really...

2307
01:43:33,347 --> 01:43:34,382
There's some good noises in there.

2308
01:43:34,467 --> 01:43:36,378
That backhand
sounded like Raiders of the Lost Ark.

2309
01:43:36,467 --> 01:43:38,935
I know. The punch noises are so loud.

2310
01:43:39,027 --> 01:43:41,097
But also, you guys did
a really good job with this,

2311
01:43:41,187 --> 01:43:43,064
and, obviously, Paul, the stunt coordinator.

2312
01:43:43,147 --> 01:43:44,944
But it looks proper. It looks really good.

2313
01:43:45,027 --> 01:43:48,019
I actually cut together Paul's video of the...

2314
01:43:48,107 --> 01:43:51,622
It's a shame I couldn't get that for the DVD.
That would've been good.

2315
01:43:52,427 --> 01:43:55,703
- Oh, he's got the hand. He's got the hand!
- The backhand crunching.

2316
01:43:55,867 --> 01:43:56,902
...village!

2317
01:43:56,987 --> 01:43:59,820
Dalton gets four in,
but, of course, for the last one...

2318
01:43:59,907 --> 01:44:01,545
- No! Catches it.
- No!

2319
01:44:01,627 --> 01:44:04,300
- Sorry.
- Comes back up. The music swells.

2320
01:44:04,387 --> 01:44:07,106
- He says a cool line. Punch. He's down.
- Eat that.

2321
01:44:07,187 --> 01:44:11,305
It's a BAFTA! Maybe it's not a BAFTA, no.
Not for this kind of film.

2322
01:44:11,467 --> 01:44:15,142
BAFTA nomination unlikely.
But this makes me laugh.

2323
01:44:15,227 --> 01:44:17,741
In one of the Clint Eastwood films,

2324
01:44:17,827 --> 01:44:20,580
that's where it would say,
"A Malpaso Production."

2325
01:44:20,667 --> 01:44:22,942
You've got the crane shot.
It's like the film is over.

2326
01:44:23,027 --> 01:44:26,906
It would be the end, but, of course,
we still have 16 endings to go.

2327
01:44:27,827 --> 01:44:30,057
Here he comes, and here's one of them.

2328
01:44:30,827 --> 01:44:33,057
- I love the way that...
- He's got a box-cutter knife.

2329
01:44:33,147 --> 01:44:35,263
Timothy draws out that "Angel" so well.

2330
01:44:35,347 --> 01:44:36,700
But also, the fact that he...

2331
01:44:36,787 --> 01:44:40,143
The box-cutter knife,
he kind of flicks it out really slowly.

2332
01:44:41,067 --> 01:44:43,058
- I love this bit.
- Holy shit.

2333
01:44:45,187 --> 01:44:48,145
Again, this was storyboarded
exactly like this.

2334
01:44:48,227 --> 01:44:50,502
If you look at the boards,
it looks exactly like the boards,

2335
01:44:50,587 --> 01:44:55,103
but still, I'm still so impressed
with how well the effect worked on that.

2336
01:44:55,187 --> 01:44:58,782
So poetic that Skinner,
who had orchestrated Messenger's death

2337
01:44:58,867 --> 01:45:02,177
by church roof,
suffers a similar fate but backwards.

2338
01:45:02,267 --> 01:45:06,180
All action films have got to have somebody
being impaled by it.

2339
01:45:06,267 --> 01:45:08,542
- Well, Stuart's got a great impalement...
- Con Air, Ricochet.

2340
01:45:08,627 --> 01:45:10,379
...in No Escape.
- No Escape. Absolutely.

2341
01:45:10,467 --> 01:45:11,616
He lands on a great big spike.

2342
01:45:11,707 --> 01:45:12,901
Hand That Rocks the Cradle.

2343
01:45:12,987 --> 01:45:15,945
Not that that's an action film,
although there is a killer nanny.

2344
01:45:16,027 --> 01:45:17,176
Oh, come on.

2345
01:45:17,267 --> 01:45:18,859
Pack it in, Frank, you silly bastard!

2346
01:45:18,947 --> 01:45:20,619
Not another hostage situation.

2347
01:45:20,707 --> 01:45:23,505
Well, like you said, there's dialogue here
that's quite self-reflexive.

2348
01:45:23,587 --> 01:45:24,622
The thing of "pack it in,"

2349
01:45:24,707 --> 01:45:26,504
like, "We've had enough
of these hostage situations."

2350
01:45:26,587 --> 01:45:29,385
- Yeah, yeah.
- "I'll tell you how this is gonna end."

2351
01:45:29,507 --> 01:45:31,975
Also, the earlier thing when you say about,

2352
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:33,864
"Put an end to this absurd story."

2353
01:45:33,947 --> 01:45:35,062
Yeah.

2354
01:45:35,907 --> 01:45:38,023
And here we have the Point Break...

2355
01:45:38,507 --> 01:45:39,906
I just like the shot of Jim Broadbent

2356
01:45:39,987 --> 01:45:41,659
running through a sprinkler in slow motion.

2357
01:45:41,747 --> 01:45:43,146
When was the last time we saw that
in a film?

2358
01:45:43,227 --> 01:45:46,185
I read somebody somewhere saying,
"It was so obvious, this bit."

2359
01:45:46,267 --> 01:45:50,545
And it's like, "Well, of course it's obvious.
It's a complete telegraphed reference."

2360
01:45:50,627 --> 01:45:51,742
I love it.

2361
01:45:53,027 --> 01:45:54,346
It's the point.

2362
01:45:54,987 --> 01:45:58,980
The thing of the swan
in the back of his car...

2363
01:45:59,067 --> 01:46:00,705
There's so many films like...

2364
01:46:00,787 --> 01:46:04,097
I think some people assume
it's an Aliens or Jurassic Park reference,

2365
01:46:04,187 --> 01:46:08,499
but the fact is that films with animals...

2366
01:46:08,587 --> 01:46:11,340
Like Kingdom of the Spiders,
Woody Strode is driving away from town.

2367
01:46:11,427 --> 01:46:13,463
Who's in the back seat?
Only a fucking tarantula.

2368
01:46:13,547 --> 01:46:15,822
- No!
- No! Not the tarantula!

2369
01:46:21,707 --> 01:46:22,696
I love the fact that that stunt
is in a wide shot.

2370
01:46:22,747 --> 01:46:23,702
- It's great.
- There's something extremely pathetic

2371
01:46:23,747 --> 01:46:25,863
about seeing an Astra crash
into the only tree that's in the field.

2372
01:46:25,947 --> 01:46:27,062
With a great crunch.

2373
01:46:27,147 --> 01:46:28,341
I love the fact that Doris...

2374
01:46:28,427 --> 01:46:31,180
There's a lovely little thing going on there
between Jim and Doris,

2375
01:46:31,267 --> 01:46:33,019
between Jim and Olivia.

2376
01:46:33,107 --> 01:46:34,699
I hope people catch
the perfect Sunday thing

2377
01:46:34,787 --> 01:46:36,106
just as it goes out of shot.

2378
01:46:36,187 --> 01:46:38,621
There's lan Holm there,
playing one of the ambulance men.

2379
01:46:38,707 --> 01:46:42,620
All the hoodies capturing it on their phones.

2380
01:46:43,027 --> 01:46:44,255
Now, we said in the other commentary...

2381
01:46:44,347 --> 01:46:47,737
They've probably put that on their files
next to some happy slapping.

2382
01:46:47,827 --> 01:46:50,819
We actually tried doing this, didn't we,
with the helicopter running...

2383
01:46:50,907 --> 01:46:52,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2384
01:46:52,427 --> 01:46:54,543
Well, that shot of the helicopter,
when it goes over you,

2385
01:46:54,627 --> 01:46:55,776
is actually a digital shot.

2386
01:46:55,867 --> 01:46:58,062
Ironically, we did actually shoot it
with a real helicopter,

2387
01:46:58,147 --> 01:46:59,785
you see on the making-of stuff,

2388
01:46:59,867 --> 01:47:01,744
but it was a cloudy day when we did it.

2389
01:47:01,827 --> 01:47:04,182
And then when we did the rest of the scene,
it was sunny,

2390
01:47:04,267 --> 01:47:05,939
so we had to stitch it together.

2391
01:47:06,027 --> 01:47:07,745
Jon Spencer's track here.

2392
01:47:07,827 --> 01:47:09,055
When we got this track in...

2393
01:47:09,147 --> 01:47:12,059
Jon Spencer from the Blues Explosion,
my favourite band, did this track,

2394
01:47:12,147 --> 01:47:14,536
and I was so pleased when I heard it.

2395
01:47:14,627 --> 01:47:15,742
It was amazing.

2396
01:47:15,827 --> 01:47:19,217
Especially because he did lyrics
to go with the scenes,

2397
01:47:19,307 --> 01:47:22,617
like, "That's right.
Everybody's going to jail."

2398
01:47:23,547 --> 01:47:25,856
I like the idea of going
completely over the top

2399
01:47:31,587 --> 01:47:32,576
with the Tony Scott-isms at the end.

2400
01:47:32,627 --> 01:47:33,582
It's worth pointing out, as well,

2401
01:47:33,627 --> 01:47:34,582
that when we were little 20-somethings,
years and years ago,

2402
01:47:34,627 --> 01:47:36,299
Edgar would produce Jon Spencer albums
round at his house and say, "Listen to this."

2403
01:47:36,387 --> 01:47:40,858
And then, here he is, having a personally
scored moment from his film by him,

2404
01:47:40,947 --> 01:47:43,222
which is a nice little bit of circularity.

2405
01:47:43,307 --> 01:47:47,266
As bonus endings go,
and the idea of multiple endings,

2406
01:47:47,347 --> 01:47:50,942
this is what I call
the sitcom break-bumper thing,

2407
01:47:51,027 --> 01:47:52,938
when it comes back
from the end of a sitcom

2408
01:47:53,027 --> 01:47:54,096
and there's another scene.

2409
01:47:54,187 --> 01:47:55,700
- Yeah, yeah.
- They're all back at the office.

2410
01:47:55,787 --> 01:47:57,584
The music,
when it comes back to the station,

2411
01:47:57,667 --> 01:47:58,895
I think, is a bit sitcom-y.

2412
01:47:58,987 --> 01:48:01,376
Also, how the hell
did they not manage to see

2413
01:48:01,467 --> 01:48:04,027
that Edward was hiding in
the fucking cupboard with a blunderbuss?

2414
01:48:04,107 --> 01:48:05,540
And not dead.

2415
01:48:05,627 --> 01:48:08,585
He's bonus baddy number three.

2416
01:48:08,667 --> 01:48:10,862
I think it's quite a cleverly...

2417
01:48:10,947 --> 01:48:13,984
Well, Die Hard was the first film to do that...

2418
01:48:14,067 --> 01:48:15,466
Yeah, it's when... What's his name?

2419
01:48:15,547 --> 01:48:18,539
...when Alexander Godunov, the ballet
dancer guy, comes back at the end,

2420
01:48:18,627 --> 01:48:20,857
and it's like, "Oh, he's not dead."

2421
01:48:21,067 --> 01:48:22,785
But also, the thing of...

2422
01:48:22,867 --> 01:48:25,859
You kind of forget him
because there's so many baddies.

2423
01:48:25,947 --> 01:48:28,666
- "Oh, God, no."
- You have to blow shit up.

2424
01:48:30,227 --> 01:48:31,979
This miniature here...

2425
01:48:32,067 --> 01:48:34,820
That's real, this is miniature,
which is amazing.

2426
01:48:35,187 --> 01:48:37,985
The model shop was amazing.
Artem did a great job.

2427
01:48:38,827 --> 01:48:44,026
Also, how amazing to blow Edward
Woodward up in such a spectacular fashion.

2428
01:48:44,107 --> 01:48:45,506
Now, check out... There's the hedgehog.

2429
01:48:45,587 --> 01:48:47,976
I remember being in the dub
when you put the squeak on that.

2430
01:48:48,067 --> 01:48:50,297
Yeah, the hedgehog is the first survivor.

2431
01:48:50,387 --> 01:48:53,459
I've got to say, Olivia Colman
looks gorgeous all grubbied up.

2432
01:48:53,547 --> 01:48:54,900
You know who didn't have
any grub on them?

2433
01:48:54,987 --> 01:48:56,056
- Saxon.
- Saxon.

2434
01:48:56,147 --> 01:48:59,344
Saxon, strangely,
had no soot on him whatsoever.

2435
01:48:59,427 --> 01:49:01,782
- The dog completely...
- He was fussy like that.

2436
01:49:01,867 --> 01:49:03,380
He didn't like soot.

2437
01:49:03,667 --> 01:49:06,465
He wasn't happy with being muddy.
Mind you, nor was Paddy.

2438
01:49:06,987 --> 01:49:07,976
No.

2439
01:49:08,587 --> 01:49:13,024
Here's some nice, wafting bits of paper

2440
01:49:13,107 --> 01:49:14,142
just to really over-egg the pudding.

2441
01:49:19,387 --> 01:49:20,387
Actually, the Andes were...

2442
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:21,387
Rafe and Paddy were doing
some funny stuff, crying on each other.

2443
01:49:21,387 --> 01:49:22,387
Oh, yeah, you can hear them
in the background going, "Andy!"

2444
01:49:22,387 --> 01:49:23,376
- "Andy!"
- Sort of mimicking you.

2445
01:49:23,587 --> 01:49:25,384
So this is obviously
the cottage that is mentioned

2446
01:49:25,467 --> 01:49:26,946
right in the first scene with Steve Coogan

2447
01:49:27,027 --> 01:49:28,346
when he says, "A lovely little cottage,"

2448
01:49:28,427 --> 01:49:31,225
which, then, Frank Butterman informs him
isn't ready.

2449
01:49:31,307 --> 01:49:33,298
"Hot Fuzz" on the top of the Subaru there.

2450
01:49:33,387 --> 01:49:35,821
Where Angel eventually settles down.

2451
01:49:36,587 --> 01:49:40,136
Now, I love the fact you put your glasses on.

2452
01:49:40,267 --> 01:49:43,065
It's like you've turned into
a fascist super-cop here

2453
01:49:43,147 --> 01:49:44,216
with your black gloves.

2454
01:49:44,307 --> 01:49:45,786
Oh, yeah, but that was always our intention,

2455
01:49:45,867 --> 01:49:49,177
that the resolution
wasn't necessarily the ideal,

2456
01:49:49,267 --> 01:49:54,500
in that now the town was being run
by an overachieving fascist.

2457
01:49:55,587 --> 01:49:58,181
Charles Bronson from Death Wish
has come to town.

2458
01:49:58,907 --> 01:50:02,104
And wouldn't it be great if, in a sillier film,
if it was more Airplane-ish,

2459
01:50:02,187 --> 01:50:04,655
you would've put an audience going...

2460
01:50:04,747 --> 01:50:07,659
Well, the idea for this scene was,
in the end of action films...

2461
01:50:07,747 --> 01:50:09,817
- It came quite late, didn't it?
- Yeah, the idea...

2462
01:50:09,907 --> 01:50:11,135
Like in L.A. Confidential,

2463
01:50:11,227 --> 01:50:13,536
where Bud White turns up at the end
and you think...

2464
01:50:13,627 --> 01:50:15,458
It's almost like it's been shown
to a preview audience

2465
01:50:15,547 --> 01:50:18,300
and they've said, "We don't like the fact
that Danny Butterman dies."

2466
01:50:18,387 --> 01:50:21,026
They say, "We gotta re-shoot it
and bring Danny Butterman back."

2467
01:50:21,107 --> 01:50:22,381
So the idea with that graveyard scene,

2468
01:50:22,467 --> 01:50:25,584
it's like a test audience
had come up with that.

2469
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:28,500
This is the most over-edited sequence
of all time.

2470
01:50:28,627 --> 01:50:30,663
Originally I'd intended to do this
with one shot.

2471
01:50:31,507 --> 01:50:33,941
It didn't really work, so I thought
I'd go completely the other way.

2472
01:50:35,027 --> 01:50:37,143
It's like the end of Back to the Future,
that scene.

2473
01:50:37,227 --> 01:50:40,936
The idea of having the title at the end...
The title is not anywhere earlier on.

2474
01:50:41,027 --> 01:50:44,986
It's because of the idea that the film
hasn't really become Hot Fuzz until the end.

2475
01:50:45,067 --> 01:50:47,661
Very, very smartly worked out.
Yeah, that's true.

2476
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:49,620
These credits go past so fast,

2477
01:50:49,707 --> 01:50:53,063
but you can't really go wrong
with Supergrass, can you? Pegg.

2478
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:55,138
- Pegg. Frost.
- Simon Regg.

2479
01:50:56,067 --> 01:50:57,216
Mick Ross.

2480
01:50:57,747 --> 01:50:58,975
John Broadbean.

2481
01:50:59,187 --> 01:51:02,065
- And Paddy Constantine.
- And Paddy Constantine.

2482
01:51:03,707 --> 01:51:06,858
- Timothy Dateen.
- What a list.

2483
01:51:06,947 --> 01:51:08,824
- William Whitelaw.
- Willie Bitelaw.

2484
01:51:08,907 --> 01:51:10,260
Ewa Weewa.

2485
01:51:10,827 --> 01:51:12,465
Oh, too many there.

2486
01:51:12,787 --> 01:51:16,018
- What a cast. Blimey. Amazing.
- We got spoilt there.

2487
01:51:16,107 --> 01:51:19,099
We were spoilt for choice,
an embarrassment of riches.

2488
01:51:19,667 --> 01:51:22,261
And not a demon among them.

2489
01:51:22,347 --> 01:51:25,180
Everybody was up for the crack
and had a great time.

2490
01:51:25,267 --> 01:51:27,986
- Apart from the swan, Elvis, the swan.
- Oh, Elvis was a wanker.

2491
01:51:28,067 --> 01:51:31,025
- He was such a diva.
- He was quackers.

2492
01:51:31,107 --> 01:51:33,257
What did Nick say,
that he's waiting for his test results?

2493
01:51:33,347 --> 01:51:35,542
Yeah, he was waiting for HN51 results.

2494
01:51:35,627 --> 01:51:38,300
Yeah, he was very tense
during the avian flu epidemic.

2495
01:51:38,387 --> 01:51:41,902
- There's the real Nick Angel. There he is.
- We borrowed his name.

2496
01:51:45,267 --> 01:51:46,905
Here you go. Here comes the Fratellis.

2497
01:51:46,987 --> 01:51:51,742
We borrowed his name
because we thought it was a wonderful...

2498
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:54,425
A sort of combination of good and evil,

2499
01:51:54,507 --> 01:51:57,658
in Old Nick, aye, the devil,
and Angel as in the angelic host.

2500
01:51:57,747 --> 01:51:59,738
- Also, you're nicked.
- Nick, Nick, Nick.

2501
01:51:59,827 --> 01:52:02,022
Nick Angel, he's one good cop.

2502
01:52:02,107 --> 01:52:04,302
Nick Angel, he's one tough cop.

2503
01:52:04,387 --> 01:52:05,581
He's one tough music supervisor.

2504
01:52:05,667 --> 01:52:08,227
Danny Butterman, he is also a cop.

2505
01:52:09,067 --> 01:52:11,058
Now, that was one of the original voiceovers
for a trailer.

2506
01:52:11,147 --> 01:52:13,103
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Karen Beever.

2507
01:52:13,187 --> 01:52:14,336
Now, we wouldn't...

2508
01:52:14,427 --> 01:52:16,304
Karen Beever does not get enough credit.

2509
01:52:16,387 --> 01:52:18,821
We would not be anywhere
without the Beeve.

2510
01:52:18,907 --> 01:52:21,296
Yes, we have lots of great producers,
Nira among them,

2511
01:52:21,387 --> 01:52:23,059
but I'd like to say now that...

2512
01:52:23,147 --> 01:52:25,183
And it might be...
Karen's going back to Australia,

2513
01:52:25,267 --> 01:52:30,660
and I think we're all gonna have a little
Karen-shaped hole in our repertoire.

2514
01:52:30,787 --> 01:52:33,255
She worked so hard.

2515
01:52:33,547 --> 01:52:35,458
- Everybody worked so hard.
- Everybody works hard.

2516
01:52:35,547 --> 01:52:36,821
But Karen deserves special...

2517
01:52:36,907 --> 01:52:40,297
We have a central family, kind of,
from the beginning,

2518
01:52:40,387 --> 01:52:42,343
of us and Nira and Karen,

2519
01:52:43,027 --> 01:52:45,860
and it's a very close-knit group.

2520
01:52:45,947 --> 01:52:48,859
Basically, what I'm saying is,
Karen, don't go. We're gonna start crying.

2521
01:52:48,947 --> 01:52:51,780
Well, Australia's closed, apparently,
anyway, to you.

2522
01:52:51,867 --> 01:52:53,983
We're gonna have to make the next film
in Australia.

2523
01:52:54,067 --> 01:52:55,898
Me, you and Nira have to go over.

2524
01:52:55,987 --> 01:52:59,502
Also, we should mention Matt Nettheim,
who was our stills photographer,

2525
01:52:59,587 --> 01:53:02,420
who's an Australian,
who's an amazing photographer.

2526
01:53:02,507 --> 01:53:07,023
- The entire crew here was just amazing.
- Candice Banks.

2527
01:53:07,107 --> 01:53:08,426
So many people working on it. It's crazy.

2528
01:53:08,507 --> 01:53:11,738
Jane Walker, our makeup artist,
and Candice and Tony.

2529
01:53:12,187 --> 01:53:14,462
Lordy. Look at these names.
Too many people.

2530
01:53:14,547 --> 01:53:17,141
Katie Rudge looked after the extras.

2531
01:53:17,427 --> 01:53:18,416
The...

2532
01:53:19,027 --> 01:53:21,780
We had such a large camera crew, as well.
It was incredible.

2533
01:53:21,867 --> 01:53:23,903
Like Peter Field.
He was one of our B camera operators.

2534
01:53:23,987 --> 01:53:26,103
He was great. He was amazing.

2535
01:53:26,187 --> 01:53:27,700
Simon Baker, the star of Land of the Dead?

2536
01:53:27,787 --> 01:53:28,776
Yeah. Absolutely.

2537
01:53:28,867 --> 01:53:30,664
- And The Devil Wears Prada.
- Yeah.

2538
01:53:30,747 --> 01:53:32,465
He has very strange eyebrows
in The Devil Wears Prada.

2539
01:53:32,547 --> 01:53:33,821
Has anybody noticed? Have you seen that?

2540
01:53:33,907 --> 01:53:34,942
No, I haven't seen it yet.

2541
01:53:35,027 --> 01:53:37,063
Look out for Simon Baker's eyebrows
in The Devil Wears Prada.

2542
01:53:37,147 --> 01:53:39,615
- I don't know what happened, but I like it.
- Artem.

2543
01:53:40,387 --> 01:53:41,422
Man.

2544
01:53:41,507 --> 01:53:42,906
This is Jon Spencer's track.

2545
01:53:42,987 --> 01:53:46,184
This is Here Come the Fuzz,
which he did specially for the film.

2546
01:53:46,267 --> 01:53:48,827
And it never fails to make me laugh
when Jon Spencer sings...

2547
01:53:48,907 --> 01:53:50,738
Straight out of Sandford

2548
01:53:50,827 --> 01:53:52,146
I'm Nicholas Angel

2549
01:53:52,227 --> 01:53:53,546
I'm cleaning up the streets

2550
01:53:53,627 --> 01:53:55,663
- It's so funny.
- And somebody's going, "Butterman."

2551
01:53:55,747 --> 01:53:56,896
- "And Butterman."
- "Butterman."

2552
01:53:56,987 --> 01:53:58,215
He also goes like...

2553
01:53:58,307 --> 01:54:00,901
That's how they do it
down in the west country

2554
01:54:00,987 --> 01:54:02,500
- He's just amazing.
- Amazing, that man.

2555
01:54:02,587 --> 01:54:06,546
Jon Spencer, I know I've never told you this,
but I actually love you.

2556
01:54:06,627 --> 01:54:08,618
I have a man-crush on you

2557
01:54:08,707 --> 01:54:11,016
very similar to my man-crush
on Clint Eastwood.

2558
01:54:11,107 --> 01:54:13,541
- That's good company.
- Man-crush?

2559
01:54:13,627 --> 01:54:16,221
"Minibus drivers."

2560
01:54:16,307 --> 01:54:18,616
I was wondering what the hell that said.
Morag Webster.

2561
01:54:18,707 --> 01:54:22,461
Now, we have to give huge props
to Morag Webster, our unit nurse,

2562
01:54:22,547 --> 01:54:25,983
who patched up
so many cuts and scratches on this

2563
01:54:26,307 --> 01:54:27,945
and has been with us since Spaced.

2564
01:54:28,027 --> 01:54:30,587
There's my brother there, Oscar Wright,
second time on the credits.

2565
01:54:30,667 --> 01:54:33,625
Oggie Wright.
Oggie and Eggie, the eternal conundrum.

2566
01:54:34,507 --> 01:54:37,021
Which one could win in a fight?
We don't know.

2567
01:54:37,107 --> 01:54:39,143
That's all
David Arnold's amazing crew there.

2568
01:54:39,227 --> 01:54:41,457
Look at these amazing songs, as well.

2569
01:54:41,547 --> 01:54:44,266
What an amazing soundtrack
to get together. XTC.

2570
01:54:44,467 --> 01:54:45,946
Adam Ant, Tub Thumper.

2571
01:54:46,347 --> 01:54:48,178
The no-hit wonder, Tub Thumper.

2572
01:54:48,267 --> 01:54:51,384
I have to say,
you're a very adept music compiler, Eggie.

2573
01:54:51,467 --> 01:54:53,697
- You get some fantastic...
- I love it.

2574
01:54:53,787 --> 01:54:58,497
I mean, you do it with the relish
of John Cusack's character in High Fidelity.

2575
01:54:58,587 --> 01:55:02,136
I'm such a nerd. I love it.

2576
01:55:02,507 --> 01:55:03,496
There it is, people.

2577
01:55:03,587 --> 01:55:05,657
Solid Gold Easy Action
is such an amazing song.

2578
01:55:05,747 --> 01:55:07,658
How great to get into a film twice.

2579
01:55:07,747 --> 01:55:10,386
Look at all this.
I love that One Tough Bastard is on there

2580
01:55:10,467 --> 01:55:13,584
but you see it onscreen
for all of two seconds.

2581
01:55:13,667 --> 01:55:15,419
- Now, there's some amazing...
- The Fratellis were great.

2582
01:55:15,507 --> 01:55:17,702
Now, this is funny.
You got some amazing people in there.

2583
01:55:17,787 --> 01:55:20,176
Del Toro,
my lady, Charlotte Hatherley, there,

2584
01:55:20,267 --> 01:55:21,700
- Garth Jennings.
- My mum and my sister.

2585
01:55:21,787 --> 01:55:23,778
The funniest one coming up here

2586
01:55:23,867 --> 01:55:26,506
is Quentin Tarantino
and Somerfield Supermarkets.

2587
01:55:26,587 --> 01:55:29,101
Never would you have put them
on the same line.

2588
01:55:29,187 --> 01:55:34,420
And also, my trainers, Debra Pallet,
Mark Osmater and Jason Wingrove,

2589
01:55:34,507 --> 01:55:37,226
who all made me a lot thinner for this film.
Thank you, people.

2590
01:55:37,307 --> 01:55:39,423
I think Jon Spencer said it right

2591
01:55:39,507 --> 01:55:41,463
when he said,
"Here come the mother... fuzz."

2592
01:55:41,547 --> 01:55:44,015
- We're not allowed to say that.
- We can bleep it, for God's sakes.

2593
01:55:44,107 --> 01:55:45,506
They've seen worse.

2594
01:55:45,587 --> 01:55:46,781
- Have they?
- Come on!

2595
01:55:46,867 --> 01:55:48,459
- See you in part three.
- Bye.

2596
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:49,760
