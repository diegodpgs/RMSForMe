1
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,409
Merry Christmas Eve, bitch.

2
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,082
Hi.

3
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,721
Are we supposed to share it?

4
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,722
Yes, we're supposed to share it,
bitch. I am broke.

5
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,388
- How've you been?
- I've been great.

6
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,188
You finally got tits, bitch!

7
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,194
Bitch, the estrogen has been kicking in,

8
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,561
the only thing it hasn't broken down
was these fucking arms.

9
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,065
Everything else on my body looks good.

10
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,236
- Oh, honey.
- Don't you try it.

11
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,496
I look like the real thing.

12
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,401
So, I got some good news to tell you.

13
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,506
- What?
- I've been keeping a secret

14
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,405
about me and Chester.

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,240
Girl... Whoo! I know what it is!

16
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,881
You're breaking up with him!

17
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,846
Thank God.

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,350
Because honey, if he's gonna be
cheating on you like that...

19
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,021
Wait, wait, wait. What?

20
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,024
You didn't know?

21
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,528
How the fuck would I know?

22
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,864
Girl, because everything that
you've been hearing on the block

23
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,938
about the girl that he's been with.

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,041
Girl, you are the first girl
I've seen on the block.

25
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:16,913
Who is she?

26
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,878
Girl, she's some white fish.
I don't know.

27
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,881
Chester is fucking cheating on me
with real fish?

28
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,884
Yeah, bitch. Like a real fish girl,
like vagina and everything.

29
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,256
I've been gone for 28 fucking days!

30
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,255
And you mean to tell me that he's been
out here cheating on me with fish?

31
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:33,997
Yeah.

32
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,991
Do I know her?

33
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,959
I don't know. I just know
that her name starts with a D.

34
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,160
It's something like...

35
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,599
Danielle...

36
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,468
Desiree...

37
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,137
- Dee Dee... I don't know, girl!
- Give me your fucking phone!

38
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,940
It was shut off.
I had to cover your rent last month.

39
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,152
I've been told you
this was gonna happen.

40
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,426
All men cheat.

41
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,862
That's why they're called trade.

42
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,329
Do them just as dirty as they do us.

43
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,836
Out here it's all about our hustle,

44
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,001
and that's it.

45
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,437
What are you plotting?

46
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,659
Merry Fucking Christmas.

47
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,867
Hey, girl, you back from vacation?

48
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,199
Bitch, it's a motherfucking disco
out here, bitch.

49
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,339
Why?

50
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,531
Where the fuck is Chester at?

51
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,240
I don't know who the fuck this bitch is,
but it's a white bitch.

52
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,845
It's a white real fish.

53
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:01,344
Girl, don't he have a lot of girls
that he been messing with, girl?

54
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
Something with a D!
Something with a D! Desiree...

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,753
- Dominique...
- Destiny?

56
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,884
Bitch, I don't know what the fuck
her name is, bitch!

57
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,691
Why do fish come in to our territory?

58
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,525
Cause when they're Jane, girl,
they're jade.

59
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,661
Want to smoke some weed?
I got some weed.

60
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,270
Bitch, you know I don't do downers,
bitch. You know I'm an upper ho.

61
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,243
- Sin-Dee.
- Oh, hey, Alexandra.

62
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,879
Girl, give me a hug.

63
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,046
See you later, God bless.

64
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,013
OK, I got you.

65
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,679
Girl, calm the fuck down,
it's not that serious.

66
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,513
Not that serious my fucking ass, girl.

67
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,588
I already told you, it's just a rumor.

68
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,418
You don't know just yet if it's true.

69
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,894
Bitch, I've been hearing shit in jail,
I've been hearing shit out here.

70
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,461
I don't know the fuck is real anymore.

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,801
Sin-Dee!

72
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,746
Calm your ass down now
or I am going home!

73
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,043
- Oh, girl, shut your ass up!
- That's it! I am going home!

74
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,445
White Boy! Where the fuck is Chester?

75
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,116
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all day.

76
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,587
What the fuck you mean
you haven't seen him?

77
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,823
- Oh, hey, what's the T bitch?
- Girl, what's your T?

78
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,258
Have you seen that white bitch either?

79
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,091
I haven't seen anybody,
leave me the fuck alone.

80
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,892
- Take these flyers.
- OK, OK...

81
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,830
Please be there tonight.
Don't disappoint me.

82
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,060
I will. I will be there.

83
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,830
You want me to walk all the way
to Vermont?

84
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,769
- Mary's at 7:00.
- OK.

85
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,800
- Mary's at 7:00. Mary's at 7:00.
- OK.

86
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,844
I will be there, I promise.

87
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,515
Now, I've got to deal
with this bitch over here.

88
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,809
She's getting on my fucking nerves.

89
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,313
- You got any T on you?
- No, I don't.

90
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,576
Are you sure?

91
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,487
Yes, I am sure!
You're making me lose my game.

92
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,485
This is what the fuck I'm dealing with.
I cannot take it no more.

93
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,658
- Bye.
- Bye.

94
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,855
Girl, wait, wait, wait.
I cannot do this.

95
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,293
I cannot do this, it's too much drama.

96
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,990
You just come out here and give me
all this information.

97
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,101
To have me go handle it by myself.
You're the one who told me anyways.

98
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,795
OK, OK, OK! I will go with you
under one condition.

99
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,338
You must promise to me that
there's not gonna be any drama.

100
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,635
Because as soon as there's
some drama, I'm out of there!

101
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,642
I promise. I promise.

102
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,844
Look at me in my eyes and promise!

103
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,018
I promise no drama, Alexandra!

104
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:15,785
Come on!

105
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,124
What the fuck you two looking at?

106
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,374
Bitch, like I am clockable!

107
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,239
You can't get it on me, bitch,
you can't get it on me, bitch.

108
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,470
I am fierce as fuck.

109
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,205
I don't know what the fuck
she was tripping on, girl.

110
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,416
True.

111
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,591
1351 Orange?

112
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,555
- Yes, please.
- Alright.

113
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,700
Is that a dog or a cat?

114
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,939
A dog.

115
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,134
What's the name?

116
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,412
Alfie.

117
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,844
Alfie is a very well behaved dog, huh?

118
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,540
It's so quiet.

119
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,948
It's empty.

120
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,429
And his breath always smells like
he's been eating ass for days!

121
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,861
I mean when I walk into the room, it
shouldn't always smell like homeless.

122
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,229
And those socks, why are those socks
so fucking black!

123
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,939
That's not a pimp.
What do you see in him?

124
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,607
Why are you looking for him?

125
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,508
Girl, you right! You right!

126
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,836
It ain't his ass I should be
worried about.

127
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,137
It should be that bitch. She's the one
trying to come on my man.

128
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:51,207
Bitch, you're smart!
I'm gonna fuck her up!

129
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,110
- That's not what I meant!
- That's exactly what you meant!

130
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,445
Because that bitch wants to try with me.

131
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,779
- I didn't mean that!
- I can give pussy,

132
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,954
it's called a fucking tuck.

133
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,749
Oh, my God! Look, there's Sin-Dee!

134
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,615
I haven't seen her for so long, girl.
She's looking good!

135
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,857
Oh, girl! What's up? What's the T?

136
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,131
Sin-Dee! Oh, my God.

137
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,765
So how was it, bitch?

138
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:43,956
Tell me the T!

139
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,829
Did you get a lot of trade
up in there or what?

140
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
I want you guys to come
to my show tonight.

141
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,831
I am so excited about that!

142
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,443
T was the night before Alexandra.

143
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,833
Stunning goddess...

144
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,842
7:00pm sharp!

145
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,514
Has any of you motherfuckers
seen Chester?

146
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,713
- No, not me.
- Here we go again.

147
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,886
Girl, she saw hisself
trying to cheat on me.

148
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,853
While I'm up in there, girl! Me, bitch!

149
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,614
- I wish I never told her.
- I heard about that fish.

150
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,847
And who the fuck is she?

151
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,049
Desiree! Sounds like Desiree.

152
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,787
Girl, do you really want
to go back to prison?

153
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,396
You just got out, mama.

154
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,821
I told her that too.

155
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,467
He act like prison is a bad place to go.

156
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,330
Mama, mama, you are so much better
than she is.

157
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,507
Look. My boyfriend, my husband.

158
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,709
OK, that's fine. But he's not with you.
He's with her.

159
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,412
He left you for her
the minute you went to jail.

160
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,909
- Girl, I am so mad.
- Why don't you just stop?

161
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,979
- I don't know what else to say.
- The only thing I can say is this.

162
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,149
Get that motherfucker!

163
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,476
Oh, girl.

164
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,313
Another black boy on a board.

165
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,023
They all think
they are goddamn Lil Wayne.

166
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,859
I remember one Christmas,
I was like six or seven,

167
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,357
my family bought me
the cutest little Barney doll,

168
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,029
that I would take with me everywhere.

169
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,605
And one day I put it inside
the tub with me,

170
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,772
- to give it a bath.
- Oh, girl, she tried her out.

171
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,668
And it just stopped working.

172
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,867
It stopped singing
the "I love you" song.

173
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,877
And I was just so upset.

174
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,879
The world can be a cruel place.

175
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,245
Yeah, it is cruel. God gave me a penis.

176
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,520
That's pretty damn cruel,
don't you think?

177
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,289
You speak English pretty good.
Where are you from?

178
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,026
I'm Armenian.

179
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,859
Yeah, I knew some people,
came from Armenia.

180
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,865
Brought a lot of jewelry with them,
when they got out.

181
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,436
They lived on that jewelry,
had a restaurant.

182
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,369
What part of Armenia?

183
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,198
From the capital.

184
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,043
From Yerevan.

185
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,479
Shit.

186
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:40,110
I'm from Oklahoma,
and I am a Cherokee Indian.

187
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,580
I got... I got a girl's name, Mia.

188
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,785
But, it's a feminine name in English,
but it's not in Cherokee.

189
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,985
I was named like all
Indian Cherokee babies are named.

190
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,989
First thing the mother sees
when the baby is born

191
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,825
she names that fucking baby.

192
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,060
So when I was born,
my mama looked out the window,

193
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:03,229
and she seen a red bird,
flying overhead in the sky.

194
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,009
Cherokee Indian name
for red bird is Mia Mia.

195
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,378
So, she called me Mia.

196
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,913
If you think that's a girl's name,
it's not.

197
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,022
I'm glad she didn't look out
the window and see an outhouse.

198
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,186
Can you imagine? Look, hey,
here comes "Big Shit Thompson!"

199
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,861
Right down the goddamn street.
Here he comes.

200
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,588
Oh, fuck.

201
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,034
- You OK?
- I don't know.

202
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,161
You got any aspirin?

203
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,505
- No.
- Oh, fuck.

204
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,533
- Is this Sunset Boulevard?
- Yeah.

205
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,437
You said you are going downtown, right?

206
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,615
Yeah.

207
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,010
I'm in no hurry.

208
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,222
I'm gonna take 101, OK?

209
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,859
I don't give a shit.

210
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,831
You do what you want to do.
You're the driver.

211
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,027
Remember, Sin-Dee. No drama!

212
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,394
Yeah, no drama.

213
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,032
Hello.

214
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,499
Hey, Mila, did you see Nash?
That little negro.

215
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,693
In the back.

216
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,544
Girl. Nash!

217
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,350
Hi, Nash! Girl, girl, it's Nash, girl!

218
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,376
What's up, Sin-Dee. How are you doing?

219
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,281
- I haven't seen you forever.
- Yeah.

220
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,511
It's been a long time.

221
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,452
It's cool. I'm glad you're out
and everything.

222
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,556
Look at this,
business is booming today. Yes!

223
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,851
How can I help you?

224
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,393
I just haven't seen you in a long time.

225
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,030
You are... Chester.

226
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,460
I haven't seen Chester
in a long time, either.

227
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,725
Me, neither.

228
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,300
He's been hanging out
with my new friend.

229
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,630
Her name is Dani.

230
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,530
Something Dominique... Desiree...

231
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,737
No, I ain't seen her, sorry.

232
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,039
Well. Listen, Sin-Dee.
It's good seeing you, but...

233
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,882
No, no, no, no.

234
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,278
You know where the fuck she is.
So stop lying to me Nash.

235
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,612
And tell me where the fuck she is...

236
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,483
Sin-Dee, just calm down.
I ain't seen nobody.

237
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,257
This is a place for business,
I am trying to...

238
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,823
You know who the fuck
I am talking about?

239
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,323
Tell me where the fuck she is.

240
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,655
- Listen! First of all...
- OK.

241
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,920
Get some Tic-Tacs.

242
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,327
Number two, I don't know who the fuck
you are talking about.

243
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,660
This is my place of business.

244
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,302
And you are fucking my shit up
right now.

245
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,301
Oh, shut the fuck up
you lackey ass bitch!

246
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,939
- Where the fuck is she?
- I ain't telling you shit.

247
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,301
And you need to get
the fuck out of here!

248
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,841
Look, I'm not doing this!
I'm out of here. Cause you know...

249
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,842
I told you, I already told you!

250
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,013
Bye!

251
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,841
Girl! Alexandra, girl! Hold on!

252
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,676
Just one more minute...

253
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,819
Would you just go with your homeboy
and get the fuck out of here?

254
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,184
Oh, now you want to talk shit?

255
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,765
I'm not going nowhere!

256
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,434
- I don't know who...
- Where are they?

257
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,768
I don't support that pimping shit.

258
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,964
I stay on my side of the business.

259
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,201
I am morally opposed
to the pimping shit.

260
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,639
So, listen. Don't ask me shit like that.

261
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,993
- Alright, listen, listen.
- Hello?

262
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,163
Half of the city is down at Schrader.

263
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,956
There is a food line
and they are giving away

264
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,861
$20 Christmas gift certificate.
Some shit like that, alright?

265
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,364
- Schrader!
- Food line!

266
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,162
Thank you!

267
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,866
Alright, come on, man!

268
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,040
For real?

269
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,065
Looks like you need a new pack.

270
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,494
Anybody have a lighter?
Anybody have a lighter?

271
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,362
Anybody have a fucking light?

272
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,734
Do you have a light? Excuse me. Hey!

273
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,534
Excuse me, hello! Do you have a light?

274
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
Thank you.

275
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,327
Fuck it!

276
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,863
There are girls at the Christmas party.

277
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,039
On Olympic... So fucking,
just fucking go there.

278
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,405
Just go to... Take us to Olympic.
Mexican, he is a Mexican.

279
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,079
You know where Olympic, that's south
of just fucking all the other streets.

280
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,474
You know that, right?

281
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,716
Yeah.

282
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,215
Just get us there.
Just get us there quick

283
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,410
before the other guys show up there.

284
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,619
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, man!

285
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,360
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Get out of my car, come on.

286
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,000
Come out. Get the fuck out.

287
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,171
I'm going to Olympic and Fountain...

288
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,565
Oh! I'm burning.

289
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,165
Who is gonna clean this?

290
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,167
Who is gonna clean this?

291
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,043
Just relax! It's Christmas Eve!
Where is your Christmas spirit?

292
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,514
It's Christmas... It's Christmas Eve!

293
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,448
Move!

294
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,456
You fucking animals!

295
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,612
- I wanna ride it!
- He is gonna pay for it!

296
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,082
Like a trick nigger!

297
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,015
- I wanna ride it!
- Like a trick nigger!

298
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,350
He's gonna pay for it!

299
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,652
Go in, bitch!

300
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,418
I heard his dick is little.

301
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,629
Is it little?

302
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,297
I mean, damn.

303
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,823
Wow, what the fuck is going on?

304
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,267
Going in, mommy... Oh, my...

305
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,806
I make silicone boobs. What do you need?

306
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,134
You don't have a baby daddy though.

307
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,338
- Bitch...
- You better go get fight, honey.

308
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,639
I was fucking your piece
the other night.

309
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,238
Tell him to run me those diapers, bitch.

310
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,084
Don't forget my performance at seven.

311
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,617
- Oh, yeah.
- That bitch looks two months pregnant.

312
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,852
How she going to come out here
looking like a shitty ass.

313
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,359
Ugly ass bitches.

314
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,794
- Is that Louie or Houie?
- She had my date, girl,

315
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,524
and he said that her tucker stink.

316
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,700
- No!
- You lying.

317
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,498
She asked for $80
and he is a $900 a date.

318
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,236
- Shut up, please.
- The bitch is stupid.

319
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,714
Dude, your cab reeks.

320
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,585
I know, I'm sorry about that.

321
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,225
We are almost there.

322
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,265
It's hardly doing anything.

323
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,209
Let me see your dick.

324
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,610
- Why?
- You already know the routine.

325
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,377
I want to make sure you are not a cop.

326
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,048
I'm not a cop.

327
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,860
What can I do for you today?

328
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,626
- I just want to have some fun.
- What kind of fun?

329
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,027
I was thinking maybe BBBJ?

330
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,030
I can suck your dick
with a condom for 80.

331
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,873
I can give you everything I have.

332
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,437
- Forty fucking dollars?
- Oh, come on.

333
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,673
- Are you serious?
- Come on, come on.

334
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,509
My family is driving me fucking
crazy, I just gotta get off.

335
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,946
- That's not any of my concern.
- Okay, okay.

336
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,553
Listen. I can do all the work myself
and jerk myself off.

337
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,882
Maybe you can just grab
my balls or something.

338
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,218
Please, I will be super-fast.

339
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,417
I just, I just need...

340
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,930
- Come on, it's Christmas.
- You know what?

341
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,467
Since it is Christmas,
and I do need the money,

342
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,631
I'll do this.

343
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,099
But you better come fast.

344
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,001
Run me my money, put it on the dash.

345
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,638
Quickly...

346
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,859
- Hey, guys. Have you seen Chester?
- Who?

347
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,032
Chester, Chester.

348
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,835
Him and his fucking whores?

349
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,799
I don't do that anymore.
Even when I see Chester,

350
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,165
- I don't want to see Chester.
- Oh, you don't do dope no more?

351
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,305
So this is the fucking silver living
line now?

352
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,805
It's not the fucking food line.

353
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,972
- You should ask Bob.
- Who the fuck is Bob?

354
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,341
The old man from the line.
He is a regular with Chester's girls.

355
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,347
Looks like Santa without a beard.
I've been clean for 30 days.

356
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,019
- I got my chip.
- Don't give a shit.

357
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,855
Can you just, give it
a little stroke, please?

358
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,555
Can you shut the hell up?
No, you didn't pay for that.

359
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,892
- Come on just...
- No, no. You get what you pay for.

360
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,398
- This is what you paid for.
- Come on, you know you want it.

361
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,806
You see right through me, don't you?

362
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:18,974
Oh, yeah.

363
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,643
Bob, Bob. Are you Bob?

364
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,210
No? Who the fuck is Bob?

365
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,078
- Who's Bob? Who's Bob?
- I'm Bob.

366
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,245
- Come on.
- Shut the fuck up.

367
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,846
You're not even hard yet.

368
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,013
I'm fucking hard. Shut up.

369
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,486
Is that it? That's hard?

370
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,853
Fuck off, fuck this.
It's not fucking working.

371
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,188
Okay but give me... Run me my shit.

372
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,422
Just get the fuck out.
Just get the fuck out.

373
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,757
It's not working, okay.
There is no deal.

374
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,332
I'm not going anywhere
until you give me my money.

375
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,026
What? I didn't cum. You didn't get paid.

376
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,364
- It's all cool, just get out.
- No, no, you didn't cum,

377
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,439
but because of the fact that
I had to touch your dirty ass.

378
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,870
Well, you ain't doing your job
so I couldn't cum.

379
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,876
It's enough fuckin' around.
No, I'm not going anywhere.

380
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,379
- Give me my shit.
- Get the fuck out of my car.

381
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,676
Give me my shit.

382
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,781
- Get the fuck out.
- OK, you know what?

383
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,352
Get the fuck... Give me my fucking keys.

384
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,114
- Nope.
- Not fucking funny goddamn it.

385
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,852
Give me my fucking keys.

386
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,685
Not fucking funny.

387
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:11,883
You're not getting your fucking keys.

388
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,289
- Give me...
- You're not getting these...

389
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,725
Get off, get... Get the fuck off me.

390
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,228
- Give me them fucking keys.
- No.

391
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,699
What...

392
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,038
You forget I got a dick, too.

393
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,497
Come here.

394
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,306
- Delee. Delila, Daphanie?
- Oh.

395
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,102
Something starting with a D. Come on. D.

396
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,042
- Oh, Dana.
- I guess that's it. Where is she?

397
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,475
You know where they're at?

398
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,045
A few days ago, she was at the Grand.

399
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,413
- Off of Vermont.
- Classy!

400
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,659
- Right? Simple.
- Sure.

401
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,825
She comes back,
takes a piece of broccoli,

402
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,828
eats it and was like...
"Oh, I don't think I like this."

403
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,001
And I'm like, "You haven't even
eaten any food yet."

404
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,464
So that was the beginning of it.

405
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,637
- After lunch...
- You stay with her, okay.

406
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,831
I stay with her, we go outside.

407
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,509
Next door, to the coffee shop.

408
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,179
I get Thai iced teas.

409
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,108
And I put them down.

410
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,250
- She drinks out of my straw.
- Nice.

411
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,851
Just classy, huh?

412
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,850
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, speaking of classy.

413
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,852
- Nice, Oh, jeez.
- Oh, boy.

414
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,854
- Fucking Alexander.
- Oh, boy.

415
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,924
- Have you not worked with Alexander?
- No.

416
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,262
- Please help me.
- Get off the car.

417
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,456
- Off the fucking car.
- Get off me, help.

418
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,796
Well, here is your chance,
if you want to go meet him.

419
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,937
- Nice try.
- Please help. Help me, Officer.

420
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:32,131
Alexandra, Alexandra.
It's enough, let him go.

421
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,205
- What's going on?
- This lady just attacked me.

422
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,777
- He owes me fucking money.
- Is it true?

423
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,310
No, I don't even know her.

424
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,646
I got out of my car and she attacked me.

425
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,386
So a random woman just grabs you
and attacks you.

426
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,713
- Yes.
- Yes.

427
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,355
Check the pulse.

428
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,223
Alexander.

429
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,854
Girl, what the fuck?
You know I don't do that shit.

430
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,051
I don't know. What's happening?

431
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,525
- He owes me money.
- I don't owe you money.

432
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,198
- Forty dollars.
- Forty dollars?

433
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,366
I don't even know her.

434
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,695
- Why does he owe you $40?
- He knows me very well.

435
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,995
Ask him.

436
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,339
Is that your green Passat?

437
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,196
Yeah.

438
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,308
Well we have seen you cruising around
for at least 45 minutes.

439
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,875
- I...
- So you didn't just park it

440
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,205
- and come down
- I just... I...

441
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,904
Like ten minutes ago
I was driving around.

442
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,083
- I was on the phone. I realized...
- I've seen it. You know what, sir?

443
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,512
I shouldn't be talking
and driving the car.

444
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:16,879
That's it. That's it.

445
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,847
Why does he owe you money?

446
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,717
We made a business transaction.

447
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,390
A business transaction? OK.
This is what's gonna happen.

448
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,861
It's Christmas Eve.
We'll all go our separate ways.

449
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,864
Because I think that's a lot easier
than calling our family

450
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,401
and trying to explain why we have
to be bailed out of jail.

451
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,900
What family?

452
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,264
Yeah. We know.
You posted a lot at the center.

453
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,099
Yes. At Mary's.

454
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,041
- 7:00pm.
- 7:00.

455
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,212
OK. Thank you girls. I'll see you there.

456
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,578
No, no, no.

457
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,288
- Can I help you?
- You working?

458
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,462
- Are you a cop?
- No, no. Get in.

459
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,173
Make a right, right here on Las Palmas.

460
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,599
I like right here.

461
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,278
No. It's really busy
on the streets today, so...

462
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,234
Are you from around here?

463
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,200
No.

464
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,703
I haven't seen you before.

465
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,002
You are beautiful.

466
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,043
What about right here?

467
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,314
No. The block is hot over here.

468
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,020
There's a spot two blocks up.

469
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,404
OK. To the left right here.

470
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:31,673
So... It's so nice to see some
fresh faces out here.

471
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,777
What's your name?

472
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,019
It's whatever you want it to be.

473
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,019
- Yeah?
- What... What can I help you with?

474
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,360
You girls usually have some
exotic names.

475
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:46,852
Selena.

476
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,462
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

477
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,029
Where you from?

478
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,628
Does it really matter where I'm from?

479
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,463
You new? New in town?

480
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,971
I'm from Santa Clarita.

481
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,042
Can we do some French, please? Here.

482
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:10,986
Cool?

483
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,046
Are these real?

484
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,280
Yeah, they're real.

485
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,462
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

486
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,560
No, no, no. No, no, no. Wait

487
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,098
I go down.

488
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,733
Pull it out. Pull it out.

489
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,430
Pull it out.

490
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,103
What's wrong?

491
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,171
What's wrong?

492
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,981
- Is it tucked?
- Is it tucked?

493
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,446
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck is this?

494
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,916
It's a pussy.

495
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,291
Get the fuck out of my car.

496
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,788
Give me my money.
Where did you put my money?

497
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,017
What the fuck is your problem, dude?

498
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,321
Get the fuck out of my car.

499
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,259
- That block you were hanging on?
- What a waste of my time.

500
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,659
That's not for pussies.

501
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,361
Alright? You shouldn't be there.

502
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,264
- Fucking homo, man.
- Get out of my fucking car.

503
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,200
- That's the wrong track for you.
- Fuck you, dude.

504
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,340
Don't work that track.
Close the door. Close the door!

505
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,941
Fuck you!

506
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,399
Scotty? Scotty?

507
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,166
What number is the party room?

508
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,075
So, me and my sisters...

509
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,020
Every weekend we would go down
to this skating rink,

510
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,721
and every Friday night they
would have like a disco theme,

511
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,018
but you would have to bring,
like, a guy...

512
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,556
And could never find a guy to go with
me, so I had to dance with my sisters.

513
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,114
Hold on.

514
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:35,954
Yeah?

515
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,865
Chester has any girls here?

516
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,195
Maybe. And who are you?

517
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,529
Does Chester have any girls here?

518
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,864
- Who the fuck are you?
- Dana?

519
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,866
- I'm not Dana
- No, no, no. I'm looking for Dana.

520
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,635
There ain't no Dana here.

521
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,071
Dinah?

522
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,714
Oh, shit!

523
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,449
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the fuck out!

524
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,154
- Where's fucking Dinah?
- Who cares?

525
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,755
- Get the fuck out.
- Where the fuck is Dinah?

526
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,584
Where she at, girl?

527
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,623
She's in there.
But you're not going in there.

528
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,988
- Watch me, bitch!
- Get the fuck out!

529
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,096
- Dinah! Dinah!
- Get the fuck out of here!

530
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,097
That's where she's at!
She's fucking blonde!

531
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,837
- Where's she at?
- Get the fuck out.

532
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,835
She's in the bathroom! I'm sorry, guys!

533
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,405
Dinah? Dinah?

534
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,831
Fucking Dinah!

535
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,169
Right here! In there!

536
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,009
What? Hey! Hey!

537
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,855
Who are you?

538
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,619
What do you want?

539
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,504
Oh, my God.

540
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,305
Guys, shut the fuck up! Shut up!

541
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,845
We have neighbors, alright?

542
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,279
- I'm not getting kicked out.
- Is that crazy bitch coming back?

543
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,181
She's not coming back.
That's what I'm telling you.

544
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,548
She's not coming back.

545
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,350
Girls, go! Go back in the other room!
Go! Go!

546
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,685
I better get a freebie next time!

547
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,691
No! You're not getting a freebie,
alright?

548
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,394
Did you want me to call the cops?

549
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,220
Yeah, genius.

550
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,628
Let's get the whole precinct
down here, you motherfucker!

551
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,811
You have the wrong person!

552
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,838
What's your name?

553
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,013
Dinah!

554
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,910
Dinah, Dinah, Dinah, Dinah!

555
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,859
Razmik!

556
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,090
Hey! Alexandra, come here!

557
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,498
I'm so fucking happy to see you today.

558
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,331
Oh, my God. You will not believe
what I have been through!

559
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,599
What happened? Get in.

560
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,048
What a sight for sore eyes!

561
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,111
Thanks for helping, you motherfucker!

562
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,912
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Ow!

563
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,455
This is like the second time
this month that this happened to me.

564
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,122
I'm tired of being fucking nice
to people.

565
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,956
I've got some money for you.
Don't worry, man.

566
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,627
I think this is becoming
our favorite spot.

567
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:30,872
Yeah.

568
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,048
- Hi.
- Just the wash.

569
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,999
I don't know what's going on
with your man,

570
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,033
but it has nothing to do with me!

571
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,870
Who are you talking about?

572
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,040
Fucking name? You want a fucking name?

573
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,708
How about a fucking name?

574
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,374
You know what you're going
to get from me?

575
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,671
Me, you and him are gonna have
a little sit down, a little chit-chat

576
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:52,870
about what's really fucking going on.

577
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,208
Who the fuck is him?

578
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,882
I got eight dates a day! Just tell me...

579
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,287
Merry Christmas.

580
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,456
You didn't have to do this.

581
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,762
Yes, I did.

582
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,036
What's that?

583
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,869
My performance.
It's going to be at 7:00.

584
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,875
All of my favorite people
are going to be there.

585
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,105
Miss Sin-Dee. And Miss Dani....

586
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,874
Wait. Wait. Sin-Dee? Which Sin-Dee?

587
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,578
Sin-Dee Rella.

588
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:31,879
Looks like someone has a crush.

589
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,487
Sin-Dee's back on the block?

590
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,981
Oh, yeah. She's back.
She's back and she's going hard.

591
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,596
- Come here!
- Fuck you!

592
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,625
See you later on tonight. I have to go.

593
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,166
- Bye.
- OK. Take care.

594
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,837
Say you're not gonna run away
on me again!

595
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,407
Not gonna run away.

596
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,603
All right. We're in agreement.

597
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,178
Bring your fucking ass.

598
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,768
She's getting skinnier and skinnier.

599
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,170
Everyone comes to America and gets fat.

600
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,573
Even I gained weight.

601
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,011
But this girl gets skinnier.

602
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,750
I don't gain or lose.

603
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:39,345
You always weigh the same.

604
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,854
Mom, I'm sorry. I spilled a little bit.

605
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,024
Where are the fruits? Fruits.

606
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,264
Coming right up.

607
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,123
She loves that dog.

608
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,466
She loves that dog very much.

609
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,774
I don't like dogs.

610
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,045
Maybe I'll get used to it.

611
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,779
Everything requires getting used to.

612
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,110
You'll get used to a lot more than that.

613
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,550
Again you want to smoke?

614
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,051
Eat something. Please help yourself.

615
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,055
How are you, Razmik?

616
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,791
Good. How are you?

617
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,230
Good. Thank God.

618
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,961
How is Ashot?

619
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,730
Good. He's growing old... With me.

620
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,433
Any business out there today?

621
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,082
Let her grow up a little
and then Yeva can start working also.

622
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:49,680
Well, I came here to help
with the child so they can work.

623
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,158
That's the right thing to do.

624
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,829
That's what grandmothers are for.

625
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:59,762
So they can help take care
of my sweetie pie.

626
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,665
Ashken, she looks like you.

627
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,533
No, she looks more like Razmik.

628
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,366
Especially her smile.

629
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,012
Come here, sweetie.

630
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,009
Come and sit with Daddy.

631
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,847
Come on!

632
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,487
Shut the fuck up!
What are you crying for?

633
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,953
Shut the fuck up!

634
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,825
Get your fucking ass in here!

635
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,956
Hello! Where is he at?
Where's your fucking friend?

636
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,928
Is this the person you
were talking about?

637
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,995
You need to help me! Call Chester!

638
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,600
You gotta call Chester!

639
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:35,827
What have you done to her?

640
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,630
Yeah, Chester! Where's Chester?

641
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,102
Chester's not gonna be cool
with this shit!

642
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,508
You know Chester?

643
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,836
Yes, I know Chester!

644
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,102
Why me? What did I do?

645
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,007
You gotta get her the fuck out of here!

646
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,447
Shut the fuck up! Where's Chester?

647
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,083
I'm not leaving unless
you tell me where he is...

648
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,843
Calm down! He's at Donut Time!

649
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,013
At Donut Time! Great!

650
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,084
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

651
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,090
Alright. When you see him, could you
kinda not tell him that I'm the one

652
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,025
that kinda told you that he was there?

653
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,767
Time to make the donuts, bitch.

654
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,447
Fuck up!

655
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,118
You know what?
I want to see Chester right now!

656
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,843
I can't wait to see that motherfucker!

657
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,852
He doesn't like you. You aren't special.

658
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,614
I know I ain't special,

659
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,850
but I'm his bottom bitch
for the last two weeks, bitch!

660
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,653
And when he finds out what the hell
you been doing to me,

661
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,389
I swear to God, he's going to rip
that cheap ass wig off your head

662
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,295
and shove it up your
fucking gaping asshole!

663
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,551
You might be his bottom bitch, but
I'm his girlfriend, you fucking whore!

664
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,622
Oh, my fucking God!

665
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,422
You're Chester's girlfriend?
Is that what you fucking think?

666
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:08,926
Chester's got a lot
of motherfucking girlfriends

667
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,427
and you are definitely not one of them!

668
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:11,689
What the fuck do I look like?

669
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,869
Like y'all niggas are going
to Red Lobster and shit!

670
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,662
Oh, this my boyfriend!

671
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,040
You are so mad pathetic right now!

672
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,035
You're like home like waiting
for him to call and shit.

673
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,078
That's sad. That's fucking sad.

674
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,246
I'm getting dragged around
this fucking city is not as sad

675
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,608
as you sitting home thinking your
Chester's motherfucking girlfriend!

676
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,953
I'mma perform. Don't worry.

677
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,523
It's gonna blow your fucking mind.

678
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,092
Getting my fucking hair thing.
Is that OK with you?

679
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,874
Girlfriend.

680
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,635
Shit. Fucking pathetic.

681
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,441
Girlfriend.

682
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,877
What time is it?
What fucking time is it?

683
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,573
What time is it?

684
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:09,446
Fuck!

685
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:18,000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

686
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:21,833
I'm gonna put Kool-Aid on.
That's gonna be it.

687
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,665
She goes on forever.
You know she goes on forever.

688
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,173
We're at Donut Time, fucking retard!

689
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,315
We've got something else to do first.

690
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,011
- They'll be here.
- Your fans are not here.

691
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,982
Alright, Miss Crawford?

692
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,659
You're going with me.
You've got no fucking choice, OK?

693
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,327
Is it a double date with Chester?

694
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,190
'Cause I would really fucking love that.

695
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,466
Come on, we're buddies now.
We're buddies. We suck the same cock.

696
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,442
How much you cost?
How much can I buy you for, huh?

697
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,842
How much you take me out for out there?

698
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,276
Look at your nasty clothes.
You couldn't afford it.

699
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:08,839
My nasty clothes?

700
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,313
What's this? Tricks 'R Us?

701
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,016
Listen, sweetheart, I'm bumping you.

702
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,183
Next year, OK?

703
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,020
Come on. Move your ass.

704
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,021
Ali, girl! Alexandra, girl!
I'm here, girl!

705
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,232
I'm tired, let's go! I didn't think
I was gonna make it here on time!

706
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,868
What the fuck is this?

707
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,141
Girl, how late am I? I'm thinking
I'm five minutes late, right?

708
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,533
What did you do to her?

709
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,009
Don't worry about her.
You gotta go on stage. Come on!

710
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,177
OK.

711
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,022
Look. My friends are here.

712
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,016
Come on. Just come on.

713
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,859
How you doing?

714
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,255
This one has one shoe!

715
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,828
She's from the hills. She hillbilly.
Come on, girl!

716
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,727
Merry Christmas.

717
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,334
Good to see you.

718
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,904
Come here, baby.

719
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,576
Has she eaten?

720
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:12,976
She doesn't eat this kind of food.
I will feed her later.

721
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:17,578
Let's toast to the head
of this household.

722
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,183
All the best to you and your family.

723
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,354
Thank you. Wishing you the same.

724
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,961
To your health.

725
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,599
Ashken, you have a great son-in-law.

726
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,869
He's great but he gets tired too much.

727
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,264
I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna do with this hair.

728
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,705
It's super straight
like those fucking Asian hos.

729
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,373
Is that how you like it?

730
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,706
Yeah. Sometimes. But not all the time.

731
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,577
It don't have to always be like that.
Let me do this.

732
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:52,151
Yeah. Fix your face. Fix that mug.
That's what everybody is looking at.

733
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,922
- I need to get these eyebrows done.
- Yes, you do.

734
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,218
You know... Why did you bring her here?

735
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,995
Fuck her. We ain't worried about her.

736
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,824
She ain't nobody. Today's about you.

737
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,467
Why you so up on her anyways?
With that fucked up face of yours.

738
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,829
Look at her!

739
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,005
You didn't have to Chris Brown
the bitch!

740
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,997
I told you what I had to do today.
You act like I was playing.

741
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,302
You know when I say shit,
I mean it, girl.

742
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,507
You wanna go onstage looking like this?

743
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,016
What, exactly, are you implying?

744
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:25,017
I imply that you use some of my eye.
And let me do what I need to do.

745
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,284
Do you want my help or not?

746
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,254
Your highlight's all fucked off, girl.

747
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:33,855
You need to learn how to blend.

748
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:37,032
Your chestnuts are roasting on
the bottom of your chinny-chin-chin.

749
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,830
What exactly are you doing to my face?

750
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,832
Trying to make you look better
than what you looked like before.

751
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,430
You tried it.

752
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,165
Yo.

753
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,804
- I'm just... I'm so over it.
- Yo!

754
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,170
I don't even know what to do.

755
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,709
- Yo!
- Bitch, what the fuck you want?

756
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,547
Finish your own make-up.
You know how I taught you:

757
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,385
Highlight, highlight, highlight,
contour.

758
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,027
Blush, blemish, bomb, bam!

759
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,060
Just stay over there.
I don't want to smell that shit!

760
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:12,331
I'm trying to enjoy it in peace, please.
I had a stressful day today.

761
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:14,868
Come on! Yo. That's my shit.

762
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,036
It's my pipe.

763
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:20,741
I can feel it.

764
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:23,838
Oh, girl, hit her. Hit her.

765
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,069
She's smoking' up.

766
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,749
You gonna bring this bitch here,
and now you smoking this shit!

767
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,264
Where the fuck is the red lip gloss?

768
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,794
Girl, you seen it. I know you did.

769
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,196
That's for real...

770
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:49,427
Chester took it.

771
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,333
Took it like a champ.

772
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,541
Let me tell you,
Chester is a natural born sailor.

773
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,208
If you trying to upset me
it's not gonna work.

774
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,571
I give zero fucks about you and Chester.

775
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,872
Oh, bra! He was all he could be
when he joined my Navy!

776
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,515
Does your friend ever shut up?

777
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,020
No. That bitch been talking
ever since I met her.

00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,198
No, she broke. She ain't got no money.

790
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,039
<i>Again</i>

791
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,400
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes!

792
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,342
- I'll bring you some water.
- Is it free?

793
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:12,878
Yes. Water is free.

794
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:19,385
<i>Childhood's joyland</i>

795
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:28,522
<i>Mystic, merry, Toyland</i>

796
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:36,994
<i>Once you pass its borders</i>

797
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:42,836
<i>You can ne'er</i>

798
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:49,951
<i>return again.</i>

799
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:00,859
Whoo! Yeah!

800
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,792
- Thank you.
- Go Alexandra, girl!

801
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,897
- Thank you, everyone.
- Everybody clap!

802
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,029
Clap! Clap for her!

803
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:08,859
Thank you.

804
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:13,064
Girl, that's right. She did that.
Yes! She did that.

805
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,936
This next one is one of my favorites.

806
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,440
I hope it's one of yours.

807
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:17,974
Shit. I need some more
of that shit, girl.

808
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,306
Yeah, let's go.

809
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,975
I'm going to go to work.

810
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:26,516
Now?

811
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,349
Yes, I didn't earn a penny today.

812
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,684
But we're eating.

813
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,225
- So what?
- It's Christmas Eve.

814
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,723
So what?

815
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,329
I have no patience for her.
Make sure she doesn't make a fuss.

816
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,124
I'll take care of it.

817
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,998
Forgive me, but I have to go to work.

818
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:50,368
What do you mean you have to leave?
You just got home.

819
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:54,041
I haven't made a penny today.
I'm going to work for a few hours.

820
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,013
It's Christmas and I have guests.

821
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,151
It's okay, Mom.

822
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,581
It's okay. You don't have
to make money today.

823
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:00,811
It's Christmas.

824
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:01,989
What do you mean?

825
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,419
If I don't make money, how do we live?

826
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,422
- It's okay, Mom.
- It's Christmas Eve.

827
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,524
Christmas is for Americans.
For us, it's another work day.

828
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,857
You live in America now.

829
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,759
Can you please tell her
to close her mouth, please?

830
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:13,957
I'm not in the mood for this.

831
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,161
What did he say?

832
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:18,504
Yeva, what did he say?

833
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,901
He said he must go.

834
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,441
He speaks English
but he doesn't celebrate Christmas.

835
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,011
He should have stayed home tonight.

836
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,444
I know but his real Christmas
is on the 6th.

837
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,344
Today isn't his real Christmas.

838
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:34,687
He was the only man at the table.

839
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,221
He was pouring us cognac.
Now we have to pour it ourselves.

840
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,860
Mom, he's the only one working
and supporting this household.

841
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:43,461
Let's not let this ruin our night.

842
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,828
Hey! It's that guy!

843
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,270
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

844
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:30,837
Okay.

845
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:45,918
You did good, girl.
You sound good tonight, girl.

846
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,315
She sound good, right?
She sound good, girl.

847
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,648
Tell her she sound good.

848
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,689
I mean... you did sing and you sang...

849
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,792
Alright, I'm going to keep it real
with you right now.

850
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,123
This is not critical,
this is not anything like rude,

851
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,197
this is just being real with you...

852
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:04,369
Honestly, it sounded a little old.
Like, it didn't sound like new music.

853
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,039
It sounded like something I'd hear
like a long time ago,

854
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,607
know what I'm saying? It's like...

855
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,207
Like I know... Where I'm coming from is
I know a lot about the music industry.

856
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:13,813
I know a lot of people
in the music industry.

857
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,038
I myself sing.

858
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,116
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

859
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,850
Do you know if this is still going on?

860
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,031
Oh, look at this. That's cute.
No, she's gone.

861
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,968
She was up. She was on. She's done.

862
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,365
She left.

863
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,506
She was with a friend
and her name is Sin-Dee.

864
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,676
Oh, the train wreck
and the hot mess. Yeah.

865
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,166
They left?

866
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,514
What do you mean they left?
Yeah, they're gone.

867
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,375
The cool thing is though, I mean,
look, you played in a club...

868
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,245
you got people paying you
to play in a club.

869
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:52,885
I mean, that's pretty cool.

870
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,182
What?

871
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,025
You don't want to talk about
how much you got?

872
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,591
She don't want to tell me
how much she got paid.

873
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,763
- How much did you get paid?
- Girl, she didn't get paid, girl.

874
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,656
- She paid to sing, girl.
- What do you mean?

875
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,195
I don't even understand
what you talking about.

876
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:06,662
I can hear you.

877
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:13,040
You paid... Wait.
You paid them to let you sing?

878
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:15,904
That's... That's sad. Hold up.

879
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,271
So you gave them 20 bucks and said,
"Let me sing a Christmas song?"

880
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,741
Girl, stop, it's not like you could
do any better anyway, girl.

881
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,811
Mother, I'm not discussing this.

882
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:31,256
I'm your mother.
If I don't talk about it, who will?

883
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,359
Mother, stop.

884
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,531
I'm not cleaning up. I'm going to bed.

885
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,541
Come on. Come on, girl. We're here.

886
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,912
Hey, look who's back. Hi, baby.

887
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,082
- I don't have time for this shit.
- Don't be a bitch about it.

888
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,581
Yeah, you're cute.
I love your sweater, your fake purse.

889
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,879
What is wrong with you?
Are you on something?

890
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:04,781
Yes. I'm on. I'm gonna kick your
fucking ass if you talk to me again.

891
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,622
She's been out of jail for 24 hours,
she's already causing drama.

892
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,395
Drama!

893
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,799
You two, stay your asses here
until I come get you.

894
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,901
Alexandra, you better watch her,
and don't move your black ass.

895
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:43,993
Girl, where you been?

896
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:45,525
Chester.

897
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,535
I thought they let your ass out at noon.

898
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,004
Where you been all day?

899
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,010
What? Sin-Sin, sit your ass down.

900
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:10,022
You know, you could have at least
had the decency to come pick me up.

901
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,394
Who the fuck am I gonna get
to come pick you up?

902
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,392
You know, I got Nash working on Vermont.

903
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,130
I got Ty on the West Side, right?

904
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,458
I mean I be running around
taking care of business and shit,

905
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:22,136
doing what I do all day.
You know, running this shit.

906
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:24,004
And then, fuckin', it's...

907
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,332
On top of that
it's motherfucking Christmas Eve.

908
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:27,564
You know how these motherfuckers get...

909
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,640
They like, fucking wanna get their
last minute shopping in and shit.

910
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:41,017
I had two dollars. Two dollars.
You know what I spent it on?

911
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,650
- What?
- The bus and a donut.

912
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:49,386
Sin-Sin. Sit your ass down.

913
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,832
It don't matter, we here now. Sit down.

914
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,829
Did you at least get me
a Christmas present?

915
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,844
Well, I mean, like, like yeah...

916
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:08,038
Like I get... our gift is like me
fucking running shit,

917
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,514
like saving money, like, 'cause
I knew you was getting out today.

918
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:14,084
I was gonna surprise you.

919
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,755
Was gonna take you to Roscoe's tomorrow

920
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:19,549
for maybe like a fucking, like,
a nice Christmas dinner and shit.

921
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,194
Like, I thought that'd be special.

922
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,390
What?

923
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,870
You know, I feel you. But I got you one.

924
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,434
I think you're gonna like it.

925
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,639
And I'm gonna get it for you
right now. Hold on...

926
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:35,467
Where the fuck are you going?

927
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,644
Oh, what the fuck is this shit?

928
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,950
- Fuck her! Fuck her now! Fuck her!
- Come on, man.

929
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,543
You wanna fuck her
in front of everybody, right?

930
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,218
Fuck her, come on! Fuck her!
This is what you want?

931
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,451
Alright, alright, alright!

932
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,295
Twenty eight motherfucking days and
you're out here cheating on me with fish?

933
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,431
- I did not cheat on you.
- You're a fucking liar!

934
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:00,760
- Alright!
- Everybody on the goddamn block

935
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,437
- knew about it but me.
- Hey! I'm gonna call the cop!

936
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:08,603
You want me to call the cop?

937
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,505
Mamasan, I'm sorry. I'm gonna chill
these motherfuckers out.

938
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:16,944
- Hi.
- Hi.

939
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:19,015
Are you Armenian?

940
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:20,815
Yeah.

941
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,179
- What's your name, son?
- Karo.

942
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:26,223
Karo, do you know Razmik?

943
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,053
Which Razmik?

944
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:31,232
Razmik Simonian.
He is one of your drivers.

945
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:32,990
Yes. Of course. I know him very well.

946
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,766
I need you to take me to him
right away. Please.

947
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,207
Where do you think he might be?

948
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,340
I am his mother-in-law.

949
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,515
Oh. He should be around
the West Hollywood area.

950
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,582
I will find him for you.

951
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,453
Razmik? Razmik? Where is your location?

952
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,291
Razmik is not working tonight.

953
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:04,128
I knew it.
I told her he is not going to work.

954
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,029
What is the matter, Auntie?

955
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:10,035
How well do you know my son-in-law?

956
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,038
Mom?

957
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,944
We will find him but we may drive
all night. Okay?

958
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,075
Yes, drive. It's okay.

959
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:33,822
This thing busts in and drags me
out by my hair, tries to beat my ass,

960
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,859
then she took me to some
boring-ass drag queen show.

961
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:37,258
I ain't no motherfucking drag queen!

962
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:39,228
I'm losing sympathy for you
by the minute.

963
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,026
Hold up. This motherfucking commotion,

964
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:42,862
this is all that shit
at The Grand was about?

965
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,663
- This bullshit right here?
- Merry Christmas.

966
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,568
- Yo, I thought that was a bust.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

967
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,276
Hold up, listen.

968
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:52,207
I don't give no kinds of shit
about this bitch, alright, alright?

969
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:54,846
But please, please tell me
you didn't lay a hand on Jillian?

970
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,344
Please tell me you didn't
go crazy on her?

971
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,574
Why would I lay a hand on Jillian?
It's not like your fucking Jillian...

972
01:02:58,775 --> 01:02:59,913
You're fucking Jillian too, aren't you?

973
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,347
Alright! Listen, hold on.
I'm gonna have to fuck her up now too!

974
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,525
Calm down. There's been some sort
of misunderstanding here, alright?

975
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,852
Who's name you see tattooed here? Huh?

976
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,029
What's that say? What's that name say?

977
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:10,629
What's that name say? That's your name.

978
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,628
Hey, Mamasan! Come here
and read this motherfucker.

979
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:13,857
What's this say?

980
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,535
You know, you piss me the fuck off
sometimes, Chester!

981
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:16,862
Hey, what's this say?

982
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,872
This motherfucker
don't say Dana, does it?

983
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,302
It's Dinah!

984
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:23,773
Alright, I don't give a fuck what
her motherfucking name is, alright,

985
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,971
but Boo... you have got to get
ahold of yourself, okay?

986
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,275
You be tripping.

987
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:32,418
Alright? Hey look at me, look...
Who's your man?

988
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,088
Who's heart beats for you? This heart.

989
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,251
Who's your man?
I'm your motherfucking fiancé

990
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,823
and you can't be acting
this motherfucking crazy.

991
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,793
Did you just say fiancé?

992
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,463
- What?
- You two are getting married?

993
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,824
You just went from half fag to full fag!

994
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,558
- Alright...
- Get your life!

995
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,566
Shut the fuck up. Come here.
Shut the fuck up.

996
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,636
Shut the fuck up. Shut up.

997
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,774
They said you was legit,
they didn't say you was a legit homo.

998
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,168
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

999
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:56,739
You talk when I tell you
to motherfucking talk.

1000
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,844
Did he just say
you were getting married?

1001
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:01,845
Yes, I proposed right before
she got herself arrested.

1002
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:03,108
Before I got myself arrested?

1003
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:06,152
Actually you got me arrested when you
asked me to hold your teener in my weave.

1004
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,980
You're like, 'Oh, Sin-Dee, the cops
are coming,

1005
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,815
- why don't you hold my teener..."
- Are you fucking serious?

1006
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,184
"I'll propose to you, we'll get married.

1007
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,415
It'll be a pretty thing!"

1008
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,856
Listen, listen, listen. I can't be
getting popped on that shit,

1009
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:17,361
for you it's just holding,
for me it's intent to distribute.

1010
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,089
Oh, my God, that is not the T.

1011
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,325
This right here,
is this what you fucking want?

1012
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,868
Okay, okay, okay. Listen, listen.
You gotta lower your voice,

1013
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,835
they are gonna kick our
fucking stupid asses out of here.

1014
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,666
Mamasan, I'm sorry, I'm gonna chill
these motherfuckers out.

1015
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,205
- Stop yelling!
- Okay.

1016
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:30,706
This is a business!

1017
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,208
Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna buy
some donuts. Alright.

1018
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,812
I'm gonna buy some donuts,

1019
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:39,851
and then the three of us
are gonna fuckin' chill. Chill.

1020
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:45,223
This weather in LA doesn't help
to set the holiday mood.

1021
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:47,722
There's no Christmas without snow.

1022
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:51,090
Christmas is Christmas
regardless of the weather.

1023
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,963
Feels fake.

1024
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,864
Los Angeles
is a beautifully wrapped lie.

1025
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,209
Agree to disagree.

1026
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,683
I'm learning English.

1027
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,412
- Mamasan, I like your hair.
- Alright.

1028
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,557
What do you want? Hurry up.

1029
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,349
- Do you have watermelon flavor?
- No.

1030
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,085
Don't you think we should be
getting the Christmas donuts?

1031
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,926
I mean it's motherfucking Christmas Eve.
Like, let's celebrate.

1032
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,092
Mamasan, does your husband
ever cheat on you?

1033
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:31,067
- Who's gonna marry her smiling ass?
- The one who order her offline.

1034
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,365
- Look how happy she is.
- Hurry up, I have another costumer.

1035
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:34,700
- OK.
- What do you want?

1036
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,884
Can you come here a second?
Just one second.

1037
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,788
- Hey, baby, how's it going?
- Hey. How are ya?

1038
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,754
I'm wonderful. Are you ready for me?

1039
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,861
Listen, have you seen Sin-Dee tonight?

1040
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:59,056
Yeah, I've seen her, baby,
she's involved in some drama,

1041
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:00,757
but I'm right here.

1042
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,434
No, no, I really need to find her,
do you know where she's at?

1043
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,200
Yeah. I know.

1044
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,273
And?

1045
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,443
And I know I need a cheeseburger.

1046
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,103
Jesus fucking Christ.

1047
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,048
Here, this is your cheeseburger.

1048
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,549
And some French fries.

1049
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:23,715
Where is she?

1050
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,762
Give me that money back.

1051
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,588
Here, I'm gonna give you this.
Where is she?

1052
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,324
She's at Donut Time.

1053
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,966
- Big spender.
- Go fuck yourself.

1054
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:40,964
At the Long Beach Barbeque Festival,

1055
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,836
you said I was the only girl
you ever truly loved.

1056
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,010
That's true.

1057
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,406
You know, people who love people,
don't go fucking other people, Chester.

1058
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,642
Shit, I did not motherfucking
cheat on you.

1059
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,117
I'm a businessman, alright?
I move product.

1060
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,257
That's what I do. Alright, sometimes
I gotta test the merch is all.

1061
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,153
- How many times did he fuck you?
- Don't answer that.

1062
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,760
- How many times?
- He fucked me plenty, okay?

1063
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,828
- How many?
- What is fucking wrong with you?

1064
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,930
Ten? Like, I never had a pimp
who didn't fuck me.

1065
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,434
So you had to check
your merchandise ten times, Chester?

1066
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:13,139
Alright, listen.
Not another word from you.

1067
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,364
You shut your fucking mouth.

1068
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:23,381
Twenty eight days and you mean to tell me
nobody was taking care of you? Nobody?

1069
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:24,710
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

1070
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:25,885
Nope.

1071
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,914
Auntie, are you sure you want
to keep looking?

1072
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,756
What was your name again?

1073
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:33,187
Karo.

1074
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:40,561
Karo, please don't waste my time.
Take me to Razmik.

1075
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:44,827
Chester, I was at Twin Towers,
not fucking Wasco State Prison.

1076
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,905
You really do have a crush, don't you?

1077
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,075
Hi, Rizuku!

1078
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,645
Okay, I will take you to your son-in-law.
But do you know why?

1079
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,115
Because he has to understand that
even if he does not respect himself...

1080
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:58,046
...he must respect his family.

1081
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,052
Shit floats to the surface.

1082
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,552
Sit your ass fucking down. No, no, man.

1083
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,386
She ain't fucking available.

1084
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,324
She with me right now.
She ain't fucking working.

1085
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:10,895
We'll be real quick, just 15 minutes.

1086
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,031
Yeah, puppy. Just 15 minutes.

1087
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:15,927
Who are you?

1088
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,935
Nigga, who the fuck are you?
I'm her motherfucking fiancé.

1089
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,163
Bounce, motherfucker!

1090
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,706
You retired? I didn't know you retired.

1091
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,874
- Yes, she fucking retired.
- Why didn't you tell me you retired?

1092
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,944
Maybe I am available.
Maybe it'll be a freebie.

1093
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,376
- My cheating fiancé shouldn't mind.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1094
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:33,052
Have you ever been to Santa Monica
and Highland?

1095
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,118
Oh, I don't remember.

1096
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,816
You will remember.

1097
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,923
Yo, yo, yo, listen. I got a query.
You married, right?

1098
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,856
Nigga, you got a fucking wife.
I know you do.

1099
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:44,287
Yeah.

1100
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,058
Yeah. So, when you be
fucking my bitches,

1101
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,030
you don't consider it cheating, do you?

1102
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,529
I'm paying for it.
It's not like we're getting married.

1103
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,570
Oh, you see?
That's the shit right there.

1104
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,868
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You didn't pay for it, Chester!

1105
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:01,275
He's lucky he's in America.
Imagine if he was in Armenia.

1106
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,074
Are you available?

1107
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:06,947
I don't think she gots
what you want, Ra-Ra.

1108
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,588
Nigga, come here. Let me talk to you.

1109
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,381
There's his cab. Should I stop here?

1110
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,115
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1111
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,816
Stop right here.

1112
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,184
Cause I'm feeling fucking generous,

1113
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:16,592
I have motherfucking holiday spirit

1114
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,662
alright, nigga,
I'm gonna get you Pinkberry.

1115
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,629
You ever hear of Pinkberry?
Oh, man, trust me.

1116
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:26,167
You know what? It's okay.

1117
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:27,739
I don't need money.

1118
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,976
Merry motherfucking Christmas,
you know what I'm saying?

1119
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,402
Merry Christmas.

1120
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,137
Happy New Year.

1121
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:40,843
Razmik!

1122
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,351
That is a cute-ass blouse.

1123
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,855
What are you doing here?

1124
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,685
What are you doing here?

1125
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:49,058
- I don't understand.
- You said you were going to work.

1126
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,197
I am at work. I'm getting coffee.

1127
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,797
Girl, she shopped
at the same store you shopped at!

1128
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,262
Did Yeva bring you here? Is she here?

1129
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,559
No, Yeva did not. Karo brought me here.

1130
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:57,794
But she wore it better, bitch!

1131
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,439
Nobody asked you, bitch.

1132
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:02,735
I'm not going anywhere
until I get an explanation.

1133
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,775
Who are these people?

1134
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:08,676
These are just regular people.
Come on, let's go home.

1135
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:09,872
I said I'm not going to go anywhere.

1136
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,710
Now you got her talking
to him in Chinese!

1137
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,876
This is funny!

1138
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,613
Oh, I see... you are smoking
marijuana with these people.

1139
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,788
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?

1140
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,450
If she's talking about me,
I'll fuck her up.

1141
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:22,993
She thinks I'm doing drugs.
Can you please tell her I don't do drugs?

1142
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,631
- No, he don't do my drugs.
- You see?

1143
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:27,697
He just fuck all these bitches.
He fuck my bitches.

1144
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,064
- Are you crazy?
- Prostitution?

1145
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,738
No!

1146
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,839
How do you say that shit in Russian?
Oh... prostituke!

1147
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:36,304
You have to stop starting shit.

1148
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,211
Oh, these are prostitutes.
These are prostitutes.

1149
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,074
She called me a nick niggy, girl!

1150
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,977
Ashken, let me explain.

1151
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,946
Oh, my God... these are men.

1152
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,223
Oh, my God... these are men.

1153
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,414
- Wait till you find out about...
- Will you stop over there!

1154
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:53,786
Oh, dear Lord,
my heart is going to stop.

1155
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:54,994
Will you stop?

1156
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,097
I'm going to have a heart attack.

1157
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,095
I can't have your wife dying up in here.

1158
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:01,767
Shit, she dying, yo!

1159
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,834
You gotta tell her I don't know you.
This is my mother-in-law.

1160
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:06,165
Motherfucker, I don't know you.
I don't know that bitch either!

1161
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:07,500
Mister Chester!

1162
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,178
Hold on! She calling the police!

1163
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:15,506
Yeva, come to the corner of Santa Monica
and Highland. Donut shop.

1164
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,513
She's calling the police!
Your name is Tyrone and I'm Billy!

1165
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,049
They ain't never gonna find us!

1166
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:26,016
Your husband is with gay prostitutes.

1167
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,860
Corner of Santa Monica and Highland.

1168
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,860
Tell that bitch do not call the cops!

1169
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,500
Done! Done!

1170
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:35,296
See what you did?

1171
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:55,043
Oh, shit. Who's shit is this?
This isn't mine, this is good.

1172
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:58,785
Ashken, listen to me. Let's go home.

1173
01:11:58,981 --> 01:11:59,959
Don't touch me.

1174
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,026
What do you mean "don't touch me"?
Why did you come here?

1175
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,924
Hey, there is no fighting in here.

1176
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,532
- C'mon, get up.
- Don't touch me.

1177
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,257
He hurting you?
I can call the police if he...

1178
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:09,800
No, no, no. I'm not hurting her.

1179
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,097
This is my mother-in-law.
She's just a little bit crazy.

1180
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,295
No cops, please.

1181
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,475
- Did you hear what she said?
- Razmik!

1182
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,945
"Oh, how was the performance,
Alexandra?"

1183
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,808
"Oh, it was great. Thanks for asking."

1184
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:34,152
You think the government doesn't know
about aliens and spaceships and shit?

1185
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,860
You think they not keeping it
a secret from us?

1186
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:40,428
- Exactly. That's cool.
- That's right. I'm with this bitch.

1187
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,500
- I know you're with that bitch.
- Not like that.

1188
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,505
You are embarrassing me.

1189
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:47,366
No, you are embarrassing us.

1190
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:48,371
C'mon, get up.

1191
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,443
What do you want from us?
Don't you feel sorry for my daughter?

1192
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,647
So did Mr. Falafel have a big dick?

1193
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,516
What? Spit it out.

1194
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:58,378
I didn't. I swallowed it.

1195
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:01,384
I know... I...
I fucking set that one up, didn't I?

1196
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,714
She's going to call the police.

1197
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:06,859
In front of all these people,
I'm going to rip your mask off.

1198
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,686
Listen to me. Get up. Let's go.

1199
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,124
I'm going to find out
what you are doing here.

1200
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,061
Razmik?

1201
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:24,308
Are you people totally insane?
Why did you bring the baby here?

1202
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,879
Mom, what's going on here?

1203
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,208
Your husband is a dog. Dog.

1204
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,783
Mom, what's going on with you?

1205
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:35,922
You think I don't know?
I check your bank statements...

1206
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:37,988
Every night he withdraws cash
from your account...

1207
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,454
What does he spend it on? Them.

1208
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:41,924
This is embarrassing. Please.
Let's go home.

1209
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,754
Mom, why are you getting involved
in my family's affairs?

1210
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,295
It's none of your business.

1211
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:49,292
You can pretend to be blind
but I cannot.

1212
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,127
Get up. We're going home.

1213
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,169
I'm not going to allow him
to get away with this.

1214
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:55,504
- You see that? You see that?
- Sin-Dee, leave them alone.

1215
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:56,732
Help me out, sister...

1216
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,114
When your husband goes out
and buys a girl like me,

1217
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:02,839
do you consider that cheating?

1218
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:04,381
Sin-Dee, can you please
not talk to my wife.

1219
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,880
- Sin-Dee, please...
- Get your hands off her.

1220
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,679
You even know their names? Oh, my God.

1221
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,117
- No, let's go.
- Of course he knows my name!

1222
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:12,553
<i>Say my name, say my name</i>

1223
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,857
Yo, you're the bitch they threw out!

1224
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,859
Shut your ass up, girl!

1225
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,323
What is the prostitute saying to you?

1226
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:26,463
These are the type of hoes you like?
Dumbass hoes like this?

1227
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:31,001
He comes home every night smelling like
cheap perfume and you don't say anything.

1228
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,510
I know my husband well enough.
Come on, let's go.

1229
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,679
You think you know him? You are blind.

1230
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:39,379
Razmik, why?

1231
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:43,484
Why what? What? She's been trying
to destroy our family from day one.

1232
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:44,987
No, you are.

1233
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:47,984
Razmik, just apologize to the bitch.

1234
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,992
Don't be a pussy, yo.
Do not apologize for shit, yo!

1235
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:53,097
Shut up and get out
of our business, okay?

1236
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,165
That's right, Ra-Ra.
You should apologize

1237
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,165
for taking her to
a fucked up hairdresser.

1238
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:59,996
Oh, that's catty, bitch.

1239
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:01,700
What is the prostitute saying to you?

1240
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:05,374
Razmik supports the family.
He takes care of us.

1241
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:09,141
What are you talking about?
He only takes care of himself.

1242
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,578
I'm going home.

1243
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:13,548
Mom, what do you want to do,
destroy my family?

1244
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,447
I'll see you in ten years, kid!

1245
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,418
Oh, my God, I hate men.

1246
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,559
I'm going to rip his mask off.

1247
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:22,058
Sometimes a wife
has to turn a blind eye.

1248
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,524
No! No!

1249
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,194
Get her! Throw a donut at that bitch!

1250
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:30,427
Have her, mama. Chester!

1251
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:34,836
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Bitch call me. Yo, your wife is hot.

1252
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,977
I just call the cops. You and you
and you all get out! Out!

1253
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,305
No, no, no. Mamasan, I'm sorry.

1254
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,004
Get the fuck out, now.

1255
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,220
We cool?

1256
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,027
I know what you're trying to do.

1257
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:01,528
Come on, I ain't trying to do shit.

1258
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:04,999
Come on, let me get some of that.

1259
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,178
You know you really
piss me off sometimes, Chess.

1260
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,479
I know. I know.

1261
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,655
But it's good to see you, baby.

1262
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,585
Good to see you, too.

1263
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:30,258
You know, I kinda wish
she didn't tell me.

1264
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,397
Wait. You wish who didn't tell you what?

1265
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:34,600
Duh.

1266
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:36,164
What do you mean, duh?

1267
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,496
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.
- What?

1268
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,173
This bitch is the one that told you
about this shit?

1269
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,536
You the one that caused
all this motherfucking commotion?

1270
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:45,575
Her motherfucking ass
goes motherfucking crazy

1271
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:48,213
on one of my hoes
'cause you started this shit?

1272
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,043
You get my ass thrown out
of motherfucking Donut Time

1273
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,116
where I conduct
my day to day shit, right?

1274
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,855
You act so motherfucking high
and mighty about this shit.

1275
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,546
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

1276
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,952
No, no, no, no. But here the thing.
Here the thing...

1277
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,218
What didn't she tell you?

1278
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,760
She didn't tell you that me and her
were knocking it three weeks ago.

1279
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,022
- Oh, shit!
- What?

1280
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,460
You didn't wanna fucking tell her
that part.

1281
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:09,399
You saved her that shit.
You didn't tell her.

1282
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,899
- Oh, shit.
- Sin-Dee...

1283
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,629
Sin-Dee fucking what?

1284
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:14,032
Can you motherfucking believe this shit?

1285
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:15,366
What is he talking about?

1286
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:17,975
I fucked your best friend.
Yeah, that's right.

1287
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,940
Oh, you fucking didn't tell her?

1288
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:22,046
Oh, that's interesting
you fucking tell her about this shit

1289
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:23,238
but not about me and you.

1290
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,282
No, no, no. That's right. No, no.
Don't get it twisted.

1291
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,782
Don't get it twisted, girl.

1292
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,649
This bitch don't give no fuck about you.

1293
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,085
She don't give no fuck about you.

1294
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:34,657
Don't get it twisted. She jealous.
She jealous of my hoes.

1295
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,163
You know what I think?
I think she jealous of us.

1296
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,924
You didn't tell her that shit, did you?

1297
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,563
I see what's motherfucking
going on here...

1298
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,998
I see what is fucking going on here...

1299
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:49,906
This motherfucking girl thing.
This is between y'all asses.

1300
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:53,636
This between you two. Right? Right?
So I'm motherfucking out.

1301
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,850
This is some girl shit.
You guys work this motherfucker out.

1302
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,645
Let me know when you get it fixed up.
Let me know.

1303
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:03,315
Yo, the shit she did to me was just
a warm up for your ass, bitch.

1304
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,201
You two deserve each other.

1305
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,673
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- What?

1306
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,679
- She about to get her ass beat.
- Shut your stupid ass up.

1307
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,180
Shut your dumb ass up.

1308
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,481
Sin-Dee.

1309
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:41,723
Sin-Dee, talk to me.

1310
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,961
Look, I didn't mean
to hurt you, sweetheart.

1311
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,197
You know you're my best friend.

1312
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:56,341
You know I love you.
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

1313
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,241
Say something.

1314
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:04,240
Can I at least take a cab home?

1315
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:09,748
Oh, shit. Like that Armenian dude
just left, so...

1316
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:12,252
I mean, I guess
you're like shit out of luck.

1317
01:19:14,641 --> 01:19:16,551
Get down.

1318
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,791
No wonder she's crying
having a father like that.

1319
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,056
Mother, please.

1320
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,247
Sin-Dee...

1321
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:27,565
Sin-Dee, will you just talk to me?
Come on.

1322
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,513
Y'all got a...

1323
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,227
Look...

1324
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,634
It was only once.
It didn't mean a thing.

1325
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,225
Hey.

1326
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:42,538
Yeah... I have a full house.
I called in another girl.

1327
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:47,470
So... just hang, okay?

1328
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:44,229
Please, Sin-Dee. I'm sorry.

1329
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,073
Great, now get the fuck out of here
and leave me alone.

1330
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:04,089
Now let me make my money
and go the fuck home.

1331
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,669
Hi, are we looking for a party...

1332
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,999
- Oh, my God.
- Merry Christmas, you tranny faggot.

1333
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,081
We pissed on your friend, bitch!

1334
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,284
Oh, my God.
They just threw fucking piss on me.

1335
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:38,387
It's in my mouth.

1336
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,856
- It's in my fucking hair!
- Wait, wait.

1337
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:41,618
I don't have no fucking money
for new hair.

1338
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:51,363
Oh, my God, come on, come on.
Take this off.

1339
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,132
Oh, my God.

1340
01:23:57,732 --> 01:24:00,008
You know what, why don't
I just take these off too, huh?

1341
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,115
This has to come off too.

1342
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:10,382
Okay.

1343
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:44,581
Girl... here.

1344
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,031
Oh, girl.

1345
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,740
Pull that down.

1346
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:05,905
We'll just be bald together.

1347
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,777
That actually looks good on you.

1348
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,248
Now, as for me...
