1
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,100
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thank you.

2
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,100
<i>How have you liked</i>
<i>your stay?</i>

3
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,600
What I've seen, I've liked.

4
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,100
<i>Please to explain why</i>
<i>I should agree to interview...</i>

5
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,500
with pro-Zionist
American media?

6
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Because I think
Hezbollah...

7
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,700
is trying to broaden into
a political party right now,

8
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,200
so you care about what
you're thought of in America,

9
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,100
and in America
at this moment in time,

10
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,900
Hezbollah does not
have a face.

11
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,000
- That's why.
- Perhaps you approve
journalism objectivity,

12
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
and I see
the questions first.

13
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,700
Then I decide if I grant
the interview.

14
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,000
No.
We don't do that.

15
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,300
You've seen <i>60 Minutes</i>
and Mike Wallace,

16
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,500
so you know our reputation
for integrity and objectivity.

17
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,900
You also know we are
the highest-rated, most-respected...

18
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,200
TV magazine news show
in America.

19
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,900
So, Mr. Wallace...
should he get on a plane or not?

20
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,700
<i>Tell him I'll see him</i>
<i>day after tomorrow.</i>

21
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,900
That's good.
That works.

22
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,300
You know, I want to ask you something.
I know it sounds odd, but...

23
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Hello? Sheikh?

24
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,500
Hello? Sheikh?

25
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,300
- Norman?
- What? What?

26
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,600
Take your blindfold off.

27
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,800
<i>Welcome to the world.</i>

28
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,500
Fluctuating
all over the place.

29
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,900
Anywhere we shoot here, it's gonna
be portable gennies and we'll run cable.

30
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,400
- Hello?
- Mike, it's me.

31
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,200
We're on.

32
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,800
Hi, honey.

33
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,100
<i>- Hi, Daddy.</i>
- What's new?

34
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,100
- Miss Loughrey gave me a star today.
- Yeah? What for?

35
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,000
- For reading.
- That's great.

36
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,100
A little early for cartoons,
isn't it?

37
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,700
Okay.

38
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,800
<i>Deborah? Debbie?</i>

39
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, I didn't know
you were home.

40
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,300
It's early,
isn't it?

41
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,400
Gotta take Debbie to ballet.

42
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,400
<i>Mommy!</i>

43
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Sweetheart, come on.
Come on.

44
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,100
<i>- She was playing</i>
<i>with my Pooh doll again.</i>

45
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,800
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
Breathe deep. Breathe deep.

46
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,500
Slow down, honey. Slow down.

47
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,400
Slow down.

48
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,500
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

49
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,900
- Deep breaths.
<i>- She was playing with the Pooh doll.</i>

50
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,100
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart.
He's dusty, and you breathed him in.

51
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,100
Okay? So, what's happening to you...
Look at me.

52
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,800
What's happening to you now
is cells called mass cells...

53
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,900
told your lungs, " Don't breathe
any more of that dust in."

54
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,200
And the airways in your lungs
are like branches,

55
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,100
and when the branches close up,
you get an asthmatic attack,

56
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,900
and we give you medicine,
and you get better.

57
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,300
Uh-huh? Okay?

58
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,100
Better already,
aren't you?

59
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,600
Okay, baby?

60
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,200
Can I go to dance tomorrow?
I-I'm better.

61
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,800
If you are, then I'll take Barbara
to soccer and take you to dance after.

62
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,300
I can take her.

63
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,800
Don't you have to
be at the office?

64
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,100
- Is there any more rice?
- Yes, it's on the stove.

65
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
<i>Do you want more rice?</i>

66
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,800
<i>- Maybe later.</i>
<i>- How about you?</i>

67
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
<i>- I'll take some.</i>
- Instant rice?

68
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
<i>Can I go over to Jeanine’s house?</i>

69
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,700
- I'm sorry, darling.
Have you seen my coffee mug?
- Try the car.

70
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,000
Um, what are
those boxes?

71
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
- I'm going to the store.
You need anything?
- What do you need at the store?

72
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,100
- Soy sauce.
- Right now?

73
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's my stuff
from the office.

74
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,500
Why did you take
your stuff from the office?

75
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,200
- I didn't want to leave it there.
- I don't understand.

76
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,700
I got fired
this morning.

77
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,700
Where else am I
gonna take it?

78
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,100
Why?
Who said?

79
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Thomas Sandefur.

80
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,700
What are we
supposed to do?

81
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,400
What about our medical coverage?
What about our health?

82
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,100
What about our... car payments?
The payments on this house?

83
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,300
The severance agreement
includes cash payoffs over time...

84
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
and continuing
medical coverage.

85
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
Sure you don't need anything?

86
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,700
No, thank you.

87
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,800
Jeffrey?

88
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,100
I am very pleased to receive you
as my guest, Mr. Wallace.

89
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,100
- Well, thank you for having us.
<i>- Think I got a problem with the gennie.</i>

90
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,900
I gotta go outside.

91
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,600
Give me a hand with this,
will you?

92
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Norman!

93
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,900
- He says, uh, you must not sit so close.
- What?

94
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,500
I can't conduct an interview
from back there.

95
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,400
You must move back
your chair.

96
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, you tell him that when
I conduct an interview,

97
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
I sit anywhere
I damn please.

98
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,400
- There is no interview.
- You!

99
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,500
I'm talking to you! What the hell do
you think I am, a 78-year-old assassin?

100
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,600
You think I'm gonna karate him
to death with this notepad?

101
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,300
- Are you interpreting what I'm saying?
- Yes.

102
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,000
- We're there.
- Good. Well, ask him if Arabic
is his second language.

103
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Don't interpret that. Hold it.

104
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,800
Hold it! Hold it!
Slow. Slow.

105
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,400
Sheikh, do you mind?

106
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,100
If you would just turn
your chair a little bit...

107
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,700
to face Mr. Wallace.

108
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,300
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

109
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,400
Are you ready, or do you
wanna keep fucking around...

110
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,300
and warm up some more?

111
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,400
- No. I've got my heart started.
- Okay.

112
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,900
All right, Todd.

113
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,500
Give me the three-button
on Mike, please.

114
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,000
Good. Good.

115
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,100
Okay, we are rolling.

116
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,800
<i>- Okay, Mike.</i>
- Sheikh Fadlallah.

117
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,800
Thank you so much for seeing us.
Are you a terrorist?

118
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,900
Mr. Wallace, I am
a servant of God.

119
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,900
A servant of God?
Really?

120
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,200
Americans believe that you...
as an Islamic fundamentalist...

121
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,900
that you are a leader who contributed
to the bombing of the U.S. Embassy.

122
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,400
Everybody thinks Canadian Mounties ride
horses and rescue ladies from rapids.

123
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,600
Mike, they backed locals
in Oka in a fight with Mohawks...

124
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,000
over building a golf course
on their burial site,

125
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,600
They beat up protesters at Kanasake...

126
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,800
- Where'd you hear that?
- Hello.

127
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,700
Oh, someone took a poll?
"Are all things Canadian boring?"

128
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,800
- It's Stuart. He's in Mexico City.
- Oh. Let me call you back.

129
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,200
Yeah, Stuart?

130
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,900
- What New York bank?
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

131
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,100
Will he go on camera and talk
about the Mexico City branch?

132
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,100
- Hey, Jake.
- Whose money are they laundering?

133
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,300
- No classes this morning?
- I don't have to be there till 10:30.

134
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,700
<i>- Hey, Mom. Hello.</i>
- Hi, sweetheart.

135
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,100
- Hello? Yeah.
- Do independent sources corroborate?

136
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,500
<i>- Dad, you got a box out here.</i>
- Let me see this a second.

137
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,100
- 'Cause I gotta know where
you're going at all times.

138
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,100
<i>I can't. I've gotta fly</i>
<i>to Boston tomorrow.</i>

139
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,300
2:00 P.M. Great.

140
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,000
- Bye-bye.
- "Ignition propensity."

141
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,300
You understand
any of this?

142
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,600
No.

143
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,500
Uh, this looks like
a table of temperatures.

144
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,000
- Who's this from?
- It's anonymous.

145
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,500
References to "P.M."

146
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
It's gotta be
Phillip Morris, huh?

147
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,300
Hmm. I have to
take a shower.

148
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah?

149
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
Hi. This is
Doug Oliver.

150
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, hi, Doug.
It's Lowell.

151
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,600
I'm doing this story on fire
safety, and people burning up
from falling asleep smoking.

152
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,100
I receive a shitload of scientific
papers from inside Phillip Morris.

153
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,100
Anonymous. You or anybody
in F.D.A. Know someone...

154
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,700
who can translate this stuff
into English for me?

155
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,800
Uh, yeah.

156
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,100
- Hello?
- Uh, Mr. Wigand, please?

157
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,100
Someone's calling
for Daddy, Mom.

158
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,200
- Oh. Thank you, Bob.
- Who's calling?

159
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Uh, my name
is Lowell Bergman.

160
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,000
- Did you say "Berman"?
- No, Bergman. B-E-R-G-M-A-N.

161
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,400
- I'm a producer for <i>60 Minutes.</i>
<i>- 60 Minutes?</i>

162
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
- Yeah.
<i>- 60 Minutes,</i> the television show?

163
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,700
- Yes.
- He doesn't want to talk to you.

164
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,500
How does he know he doesn't
want to talk to me? He doesn't
know what I'm calling him about.

165
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,100
He doesn't care to know.

166
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,300
<i>This is the Wigands'.</i>

167
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,700
<i>If you'd like to leave a message</i>
<i>or send a fax, start now.</i>

168
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,600
<i>This is Lowell Bergman with</i> 60 Minutes,
<i>and I'm doing a story...</i>

169
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,700
<i>on fire safety</i>
<i>and cigarettes.</i>

170
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,700
<i>I have scientific documents</i>
<i>from a tobacco company,</i>

171
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
<i>and I could use your help</i>
<i>as a consultant...</i>

172
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,300
<i>explaining these documents</i>
<i>to me.</i>

173
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:06,200
<i>Now, my number is</i>
<i>area code 510-555-0199.</i>

174
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,800
<i>I'll be there at this number</i>
<i>in ten minutes.</i>

175
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
If you're curious
to meet me,

176
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm gonna be in the lobby
of the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville...

177
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,900
<i>reading</i> The New York Times
<i>tomorrow at 5:00.</i>

178
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,700
<i>Have you always lived in Louisville?</i>

179
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,800
Mr. Bergman, what did you
want me to consult about?

180
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,200
Who's that?

181
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,000
That's room service.

182
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,700
They usually
knock first.

183
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,900
Come on in.

184
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,000
Over here, please.

185
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,800
- Thank you.
- How do you like your coffee? Black?

186
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Black. Black.

187
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,600
I really don't have that much time.

188
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,300
Is there anything you want to know
about me, Mr. Wigand?

189
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,400
Like what?
Your sign?

190
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I know what I
have to know.

191
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,400
Just so I know you know,
when I talk to people in confidence,

192
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,200
it stays that way.

193
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,400
How did a radical journalist
from <i>Ramparts</i> magazine end up at CBS?

194
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,500
I still do
the tough stories.

195
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,700
<i>60 Minutes</i> reaches
a lot of people.

196
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,000
Let me see
the documents.

197
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,100
This is a, um,

198
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,900
fire-safety product study
for Phillip Morris.

199
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Burn rates, ignition propensity,
things of this nature.

200
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,600
I could very easily explain this
to you in layman's terms...

201
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,500
because it's from
another company.

202
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,300
- But that's as far as I go.
- As far as you go where?

203
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
This issue is
a drop in the bucket.

204
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,100
I can talk to you
about what's in here, but I...

205
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,700
I can't talk to you
about anything else.

206
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,800
I signed a confidentiality agreement.
I honor agreements.

207
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,900
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality
agreements, Mr. Bergman?

208
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,800
Between journalists and management,
yes, I believe they do.

209
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,000
But I don't take that seriously.
Where do you work?

210
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,900
Did work.

211
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,000
<i>- Did</i> work?
- How much would I get paid?

212
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,500
That you have to discuss
with CBS Business Affairs.

213
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,000
But for something like this, I would
say anywhere between ten, 12 thousand.

214
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,800
Should I just take
the documents now?

215
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,300
If you want to do it.

216
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,400
I worked as a, uh,

217
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,100
head of Research and Development
for Brown & Williamson.

218
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,600
Tobacco company.

219
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,400
I was a corporate
vice president.

220
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,000
Mr. Bergman.

221
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
<i>President Assad of Syria said...</i>

222
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,300
<i>that difficult obstacles remain,</i>
<i>but that his country,</i>

223
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,700
"looks forward to a great long peace
with Israel."

224
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,100
That's a Peabody, Mike.

225
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,200
When you're dead and buried, this is
the one they're gonna remember you by.

226
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,500
- Are you eating with us?
- Yeah.

227
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,200
- Bring a tie so they let us
in the front door.

228
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,100
Come on.

229
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,600
- Debbie!
<i>- Hey, Lowell.</i>

230
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,400
Oh, Bill. Main Justice is investigating
a major New York bank...

231
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,800
laundering narco dollars
out of their Mexico City branch.

232
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,900
- You want it for the news?
- What about you? You got a crew already?

233
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
- I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch you later.
- Okay.

234
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
- Debbie.
- How are you?

235
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,000
I want you to get Legal on a corporate
confidentiality agreement.

236
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,300
- Okay.
- Boundaries of their constraint,

237
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,200
Kentucky state law about...

238
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>- I want you to drop everything.</i>
- Okay.

239
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,400
- I don't have any change.
You got some change?
<i>- Oh, here.</i>

240
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Tony.

241
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,200
<i>Mr. Wigand? You can go up now.</i>

242
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,200
Sorry. I'm accepting
an award...

243
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,900
from the Retinitis
Pigmentosa Foundation.

244
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,100
It's gonna kill
the rest of my day.

245
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,600
So, have you had a chance
to play golf?

246
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,300
Jeff's a premier golfer.
What are you, a two handicap?

247
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,400
- Seven.
- And he gets out there...

248
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,000
and he has
five strokes on us.

249
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,300
He has more concentration
than anybody I've ever met.

250
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,700
It's spooky
how he can concentrate.

251
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,600
I'd rather play
than talk about it.

252
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,700
What did you
want to see me about?

253
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,600
I don't like
being back here.

254
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,400
Jeffrey says exactly
what's on his mind.

255
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Most people consider
what they're saying... social skills.

256
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Jeffrey just charges
right ahead.

257
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,100
Now, I know you understood the nature
of the confidentiality portion...

258
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,900
of your severance agreement
with Brown & Williamson.

259
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,700
- Chapter and verse.
- Yeah, I know you do.

260
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,600
You know, I came up
through sales.

261
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,000
One of the reasons
I was a great salesman...

262
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,000
was I never made a promise
I couldn't keep.

263
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,600
I knew that if I ever
broke my promise,

264
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,300
I'd suffer
the consequence.

265
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,100
Is that a threat?

266
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,700
We worked together for...
what was it, three years?

267
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,500
Now, the work we did here is
confidential, not for public scrutiny...

268
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,600
any more than
are one's family matters.

269
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,800
You're threatening
my family now too?

270
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.

271
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,900
About the direction of research here,
we may have had our differences, but...

272
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,500
Research. You declare
as a badge of honor you don't
even know what makes water boil.

273
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,800
Well, that's why
we hire scientists.

274
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,100
Okay.

275
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,900
I don't believe that you can
maintain corporate integrity...

276
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,700
without
confidentiality agreements.

277
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,700
I was paid well
for my work,

278
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,700
the health and welfare
benefits are good,

279
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,900
the severance package
is fair.

280
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,800
I have no intention of violating
my confidentiality agreement...

281
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,400
<i>and disclosing that</i>
<i>which I said I wouldn't.</i>

282
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,100
I appreciate
all that, Jeff,

283
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,700
but upon reflection, we've decided
to expand our zone of comfort with you,

284
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,500
so we've drafted a supplement
to your agreement.

285
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,100
<i>It broadly defines and</i>
<i>expands in more detail...</i>

286
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
what is confidential.

287
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,700
Nobody will be able
to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret,

288
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,200
I didn't know <i>that</i>
was a secret."

289
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,500
We're very serious
about protecting our interests.

290
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,100
We'd like you
to sign it.

291
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,600
And if I don't?

292
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,200
If we arrive at the conclusion
that you're acting in bad faith,

293
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
we would terminate right now
payoffs under your severance package,

294
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:35,100
you and your family's medical
benefits and initiate litigation
against you, Mr. Wigand.

295
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,200
<i>- Dr.</i> Wigand.
<i>- Dr. Wigand.</i>

296
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,700
<i>If you've examined the document, you'll</i>
<i>see it's in your own best interest...</i>

297
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,800
and you'll sign it.

298
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,700
What you're saying is it isn't enough
that you fired me for no good reason.

299
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Now you question
my integrity?

300
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,300
On top of the humiliation
of being fired, you threaten me,

301
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,500
you threaten
my family.

302
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,500
It never crossed my mind
not to honor my agreement.

303
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur...
and Brown & Williamson too...

304
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,600
Fuck me?
Well, fuck you!

305
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,100
I'm not sure
he got the message.

306
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,800
Oh, I think he did.

307
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,400
- Yeah.
- You fucked me!

308
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,100
- Who's this?
- Protect your sources?

309
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You screwed me.
You sold me out.

310
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,300
- What are you talking about?
Where are you?
- Fuck you too!

311
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,900
Stay away from me.

312
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,600
You stay away from me!

313
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,200
Jeffrey, you forgot
the lunches!

314
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,400
<i>- Mrs. Wigand?</i>
- Jump in quick. Come on.

315
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,900
How do you do? I'm Lowell Bergman.
We spoke on the phone.

316
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,700
- Come here. I want to talk to you.
- Good. I want to talk to you.

317
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,600
- This is my house.
In front of my wife, my kids?
- I did not burn you.

318
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,800
I did not give you up
to anyone.

319
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,900
- What business do we have?
- I'm here to straighten
something out with you.

320
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
Right here, right now.

321
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,500
You haven't mentioned my name?
You haven't talked to anybody about me?

322
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,900
- What am I gonna mention your name for?
- Why are Brown & Williamson...

323
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
How the hell do I know about
Brown & Williamson?

324
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,200
It happened just after I talked to you.
I do not like coincidences.

325
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,100
Well, I don't like paranoid accusations.
I'm a journalist.

326
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,100
Think. Use your head.
How do I operate as a journalist?
By screwing the people...

327
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,300
who could provide me with information
before they provided me with it?

328
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,600
- You came all the way
down here to tell me that?
- No, I did not.

329
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,600
Big Tobacco
is a big story,

330
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,900
and you got something
important to say. I can tell.

331
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,500
But yes, I did. I came all
the way down here to tell you...

332
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,400
Story, no story...
fuck your story.

333
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,600
I don't burn people.

334
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,900
Ride with me while I
take the girls to school.

335
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,800
<i>My little girl has acute asthma.</i>

336
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,500
Deborah, my oldest daughter.

337
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,700
And I'm unemployed, so I have
to protect my medical coverage.

338
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,700
So I left them a message
this morning. Their expanded
confidentiality agreement...

339
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,200
I will sign it.

340
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,000
- They're afraid of you, aren't they?
- They should be.

341
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,200
Talk to me outside the zone
of your agreement.

342
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,200
- Like what?
- Like, uh, where'd you work
before Brown & Williamson?

343
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,400
Johnson &Johnson.

344
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,400
Union Carbide in Japan.

345
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,900
I was the general manager and director
of new products. I speak Japanese.

346
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,100
I was a director
of corporate development at Pfizer.

347
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,600
All health-related.

348
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,900
What else
outside the zone?

349
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,600
I don't know. Do you think the Knicks
are gonna make it to the semifinals?

350
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,100
- Just give me an example.
- Okay.

351
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,900
For example, um,
James Burke.

352
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,000
- C.E.O. Of Johnson &Johnson.
- Yeah.

353
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,800
When he found out that some lunatic
had put poison in Tylenol bottles,

354
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,600
he didn't argue
with the F.D.A.

355
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,300
He didn't even wait for the F.D.A.
To tell him. He just pulled Tylenol...

356
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,600
off every shelf of every store
right across America, instantly.

357
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,600
And then he developed a safety cap.

358
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,200
Because as a C.E.O., sure, he's
gotta be a great businessman, right?

359
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,500
But he's also
a man of science.

360
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,800
He's not gonna allow his company
to put on the shelf a product
that might hurt people.

361
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,700
Not like
the Seven Dwarfs.

362
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,500
- Seven Dwarfs?
- Seven C.E.O. S of Big Tobacco.

363
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
They got in front of Congress
that time. It was on television.

364
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Swore under oath that
they know nothing about addiction...

365
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
It was on C-SPAN.
Yeah.

366
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,300
Okay, so, here you are.
You-You-You go to work for tobacco.

367
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,000
You come from corporate cultures
where research...

368
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,700
really creative thinking...
these are core values.

369
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,000
You go to tobacco.
Tobacco is a sales culture...

370
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,900
market and sell enormous volume,
go to a lot of golf tournaments.

371
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,200
The hell with everything else.
What are you doing?

372
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,900
- Why are you working
for tobacco in the first place?
- I can't talk about it.

373
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,600
The work I was supposed to do...

374
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,600
might have had some positive effect,
I don't know.

375
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,200
Could have been beneficial.
Mostly, I got paid a lot.

376
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,300
I took the money.
My wife was happy.

377
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,600
My kids had good medical,
good schools. Got a great house.

378
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,800
I mean, what the hell
is wrong with that?

379
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,300
Nothing's wrong with that. That's it.
You're making money.

380
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,900
You're providing for your family.
What could be wrong with that?

381
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,500
I always thought of myself as a man of
science, that's what's wrong with it.

382
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,400
Then you're in
a state of conflict, Jeff.

383
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,100
Because look,
here's how it lays out.

384
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,900
If you've got vital
insider stuff,

385
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,600
the American people, for their
welfare, really do need to know,

386
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
and you feel impelled
to disclose it...

387
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,700
and violate your agreement
in doing so, that's one thing.

388
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,500
On the other hand, if you want
to honor this agreement,

389
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,700
then that's simple...
you do so.

390
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,900
You say nothing,
you do nothing.

391
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,100
There's only one guy
who can figure that out for you,

392
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,800
and that's you
all by yourself.

393
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,800
I gotta go pick up the girls.
They only had a half a day.

394
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,000
<i> I've heard virtually</i>
<i>all the... We touched on it...</i>

395
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,700
<i>- Yes or no, do you believe</i>
<i>nicotine is not addictive?</i>
<i>- Congressman,</i>

396
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,800
<i>cigarettes and nicotine clearly</i>
<i>do not meet the classic</i>
<i>definitions of addiction.</i>

397
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,300
- There is no intoxication.
- We'll take that as no.

398
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,300
Again, time is short.

399
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,800
I think each of you believe
nicotine is not addictive...

400
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,200
<i>and just would like to</i>
<i>have this for the record.</i>

401
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,200
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

402
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,500
I too believe
that nicotine...

403
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,500
<i>He referred to this...</i>
<i>the Seven Dwarfs...</i>

404
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,400
- What Seven Dwarfs?
<i>- The seven C.E.O. Of Big Tobacco...</i>
<i>referred to this.</i>

405
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,400
Said they should be afraid of him.
I assume afraid of what he could reveal.

406
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,200
Now you tell me. What does this guy
have to say that threatens these people?

407
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,200
Well, it isn't cigarettes
are bad for you.

408
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,500
- Hardly new news.
- No shit.

409
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,500
- What's this?
<i>- What that is is tobacco's</i>
<i>standard defense.</i>

410
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,300
It's the "we don't know"
litany.

411
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,100
Addiction? We believe not.
Disease? We don't know.

412
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,800
We take a bunch of leaves,
we roll them together, you smoke 'em.

413
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,100
After that, you're on your own.
We don't know.

414
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,200
<i>So, that</i>
<i>tells me nothing.</i>

415
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,400
- Besides, you'll never get
what he's got.
- Why not?

416
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,400
<i>Because of this guy's</i>
<i>confidentiality agreement,</i>

417
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,800
he's never gonna be able
to talk to you.

418
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,300
That's not good enough.
This guy is the top scientist...

419
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,800
in the number-three
tobacco company in America.

420
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,600
He's a corporate officer.
You never get whistle-blowers
from Fortune 500 companies.

421
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,300
This guy is
the ultimate insider.

422
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,300
He's got something to say. He wants
to say it. I want it on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

423
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,300
Doesn't matter what he wants.
<i>Am I missing something here?</i>

424
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,500
- What do you mean, Mike?
- He's got a corporate secrecy agreement.

425
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,700
Give me a break.

426
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,500
This is a public health issue, like an
unsafe air frame on a passenger jet...

427
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,300
or some company dumping cyanide
into the East River.

428
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,900
Issues like that.
He can talk, we can air it.

429
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,400
They've got no right to hide behind
a corporate agreement. Pass the milk.

430
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,000
They don't need the right.
They got the money.

431
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,400
The unlimited checkbook.
That's how Big Tobacco wins...

432
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
every time
on everything.

433
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,400
They spend you to death.
$600 million a year in outside legal.

434
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Chadbourne-Park, Ken Starr's firm,
Kirkland and Ellis.

435
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,800
Listen, G.M. And Ford,
they get nailed...

436
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,800
after 11 or 12 pickups
blow up, right?

437
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,900
- These clowns have never... I mean ever...
<i>- Not even once.</i>

438
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,300
Not even with hundreds of thousands
dying each year from an illness...

439
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,900
<i>related to their product have ever</i>
<i>lost a personal injury lawsuit.</i>

440
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,300
On this case, they'll issue gag orders,
sue for breach... anticipatory breach...

441
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,000
enjoin him, you, us,
his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian,

442
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,300
tie 'em up in litigation for ten
or 15 years, I'm telling you,
they bat a thousand.

443
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,900
Every time. He knows that.
That's why he's not gonna talk to you.

444
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,400
<i>Okay, let's look through</i>
<i>the looking glass the other way.</i>

445
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,900
What do you mean?

446
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,300
We got a guy who wants to talk,
but he's constrained.

447
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,400
- What if he were compelled to talk?
- Oh, torture. Great ratings.

448
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,500
What do you mean, "compelled"?

449
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,700
I mean, compelled
by a, uh, Justice Department.

450
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,700
State courts.
Be a witness.

451
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,900
That would cut through any
confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?

452
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,200
- What does that do?
- What do you mean, what does it do?

453
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,500
What I mean is like, how does it cut
through the confidentiality agreement?

454
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,300
Because he has to, uh,
reveal it in a court of law.

455
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,100
It's on record. It's out.
It's no secret anymore.

456
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,800
So how can they restrain his speech
or retaliate? It's out in the world.

457
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,400
If you could engineer it into the
court record, you might have something.

458
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,400
They would have a hell of a time
trying to restrain his speech
then, wouldn't they?

459
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah, but what venue? And where does
he get... Does he have killer attorneys?

460
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,900
I don't think he's got
any attorneys.

461
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,400
<i>He's gonna need attorneys who aren't</i>
<i>afraid of risking years of litigation...</i>

462
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,600
and millions of dollars
of their own dough in legal costs.

463
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,000
What do you say, Mike?
What do you think?

464
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,900
Even if he gets
the defense team,

465
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,700
will he go for it?

466
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,600
You're awfully
overqualified, Dr. Wigand.

467
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,400
I'm trying to start
a new career.

468
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,200
I believe I could be
a good teacher.

469
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,600
Let me give it
some thought.

470
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,200
And not a lot of companies in the health
care field hire ex-tobacco scientists.

471
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,800
That's it.

472
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,700
It's where
our babies were born.

473
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,500
Debbie took her first steps
right there on...

474
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,300
In the grass.

475
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,800
- I didn't plan on this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

476
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,800
Come on. Come on.

477
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,800
We can make this
work for us. Okay?

478
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,600
It's just...
It's not...

479
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,400
It's just...
It's a smaller scale.

480
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,300
Simpler, easier.

481
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,500
More time.
More time together.

482
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,600
More time
with the kids.

483
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,400
More time for us.
Okay? It's just...

484
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,700
Can you imagine me
coming home from some job...

485
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,800
feeling good
at the end of the day?

486
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
This is gonna be better.

487
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,800
This is gonna be better.

488
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,400

<i>- Welcome back.</i>

494
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,900
Hey, baby.
What's wrong?

495
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,900
Who's that outside,
Daddy?

496
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,800
- Did you see somebody
or did you hear them?
- I heard him.

497
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,800
- Where?
- In the backyard.

498
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,800
Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?
Why don't you sit up at the desk.

499
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,700
All right?

500
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,800
Get out some paper,
and draw me a picture. Okay?

501
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,100
What are you gonna draw me, baby?
An animal? Something like that?

502
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,100
You stay down here until Daddy
gets back, all right, Barbara?

503
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,000
You stay down here.

504
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,300
You almost got
your damn head blown off.

505
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,300
Daddy!

506
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,100
It was just a raccoon, baby.
Nothin'.

507
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,600
They're nocturnal.
You know what that means?

508
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,000
That means that they
only come out at nighttime.

509
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,400
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

510
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,300
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

511
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,500
<i>Is it too late?</i>

512
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,600
No, no, it's okay. I...

513
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,500
How-How's the new place?

514
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,900
The new place?
New.

515
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,300
- You okay?
- Sure.

516
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,700
I was thinking of
calling you tomorrow anyway.

517
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,200
- Uh, how's your kids,
uh, handling the new house?
- Good.

518
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,400
- You got kids?
- We have a couple.

519
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,300
One's hers, one's mine.
Everybody uses a different name.

520
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,200
Modern marriage.

521
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,300
Uh, how's Liane?

522
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,200
Uh, she's okay. Uh...

523
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,100
Hold on a minute.

524
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,900
Lowell.

525
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,000
Somebody may be following me. I-I don't
know. They came on the property.

526
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,300
What do you mean, following you?
Did you call the police?

527
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,100
I-I don't wanna be paranoid.
I mean...

528
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,800
- Maybe it's a game.
Some kind of mind game.
- What do you really think?

529
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,700
I don't know what the fuck
I really think.

530
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,700
Are they doing it?
Is some crank doing it?

531
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,600
Are they doing it
to make me feel paranoid?

532
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,500
Are they doing it for real and don't
give a shit what I think? I don't know.

533
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,300
- I don't fuckin' know.
- Jeffrey, describe for me...

534
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,200
in detail what happened.

535
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,300
Well...

536
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,800
No. Look, I mean, there was
a footprint. Forget it.

537
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,200
It's probably
not important at all.

538
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:03,000
You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching
high school. Japanese and Chemistry.

539
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,900
Uh, so, uh, what were you
calling about?

540
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,400
- You called me.
- No, you said you were gonna
call me tomorrow.

541
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,100
- So, what about?
- Oh, yes, yes, yes. I did.
I wanted to talk to you.

542
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,800
I wanted to hook up with you,
talk to you about what we were
talking about in your car.

543
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,500
Okay.

544
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,100
It makes you feel good,
putting what you know to use?

545
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,300
- How'd you know that, Lowell?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

546
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,600
Hello?
Are you there?

547
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,000
Yeah.

548
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,500
Look, um...

549
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,700
Thanks for talking.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

550
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,300
- I didn't know.
- It's okay.

551
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,200
Lowell.

552
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Who is this?

553
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,500
<i>Do not call here!</i>
<i>Do not...</i>

554
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,000
What are you
gonna get us?

555
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Tempura.

556
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,100
The Internet said you did
graduate work at Wisconsin,

557
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,600
then went to U.C. La Jolla
with Professor Herbert?

558
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,900
- Marcus...
- Marcuse. Yeah.

559
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,100
He was my mentor.

560
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,300
He had a major influence
on the New Left in the late '60s.

561
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,300
And on me, personally.

562
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,800
- Next to your father?
- My father?

563
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,300
What the hell's that got
to do with my father?

564
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,400
I, uh...

565
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,400
Is that why you became a journalist?
Then you get to ask all the questions?

566
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,700
You charge by the hour?

567
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,500
My father was a...
A mechanical engineer.

568
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Most ingenious man
I ever knew.

569
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,400
My father left us
when I was five years old.

570
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,300
He was not the most ingenious man
I ever knew.

571
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,900
Let's get back to Brown & Williamson.
If you decide to go on <i>60 Minutes,</i>

572
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,100
I gotta know everything
about why you were fired.

573
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,100
- Why?
- They're gonna dig up
stuff from your past.

574
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,700
They're gonna throw it at you.
I gotta know what they're gonna throw.

575
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,500
You understand?

576
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,800
I drink.

577
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,500
- Couple of occasions
more than I should have.
- Um-hmm.

578
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,200
I was cited for shoplifting
once, but it was a mistake.

579
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Pushed Liane one time. We were both
stressed out because of the pressure.

580
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,200
She went to her mother's.

581
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,200
I got, uh, fired,
because, uh,

582
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,000
when I get angry, I have
difficulty censoring myself,

583
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,800
and I don't like
to be pushed around.

584
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,100
I'm not pushing you around.
I'm asking you questions.

585
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,000
I'm just a commodity
to you, aren't I?

586
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,300
I could be anything, right? Anything
worth putting on between commercials.

587
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,600
To a network, probably,
we're all commodities.

588
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,000
To me, you're not a commodity.
What you are is important.

589
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,300
You go public, and 30 million people
hear what you gotta say,

590
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,700
nothing... I mean nothing...
will ever be the same again.

591
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,900
- You believe that?
- No.

592
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,600
You should. Because when
you're done the judgment...

593
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,600
is gonna go down in the court
of public opinion, my friend.

594
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,100
And that's...
the power you have.

595
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,300
- You believe that?
- I believe that?

596
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,100
- Yes, I believe that.
- You believe that...

597
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,900
- because you get information out
to people, something happens?
- Yes.

598
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,600
Maybe that's just what you've been
telling yourself all these years...

599
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,500
to justify having a good job.

600
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Having status.

601
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,600
Maybe for the audience
it's just voyeurism, something
to do on a Sunday night.

602
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,400
Maybe it won't
change a fuckin' thing,

603
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,000
and people like myself
and my family...

604
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,000
are left hung out to dry,
used up, broke, alone.

605
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Are you talking to me, or did somebody
else just walk in here? I never...

606
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,600
Don't evade a choice you gotta make
by questioning my reputation...

607
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,800
or <i>60 Minutes</i>
with this cheap skepticism.

608
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,700
I have to put my family's welfare
on the line here, my friend.

609
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,300
- What are you putting up?
You're putting up words.
- "Words."

610
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,500
While you've been dicking around some
fucking company golf tournaments,

611
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,300
I've been out in the world
givin' my word...

612
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,800
and backing it up
with action.

613
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,400
Now, are you gonna go
and do this thing or not?

614
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,100
I said I'd call the kids
before they went to bed.

615
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,500
<i>Stringer was supposed to be shooting</i>
<i>B- roll on street cops in New Orleans.</i>

616
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,800
<i>- What's with all the horses?</i>
<i>- Camera guy's got</i>
<i>a thing about mounted police.</i>

617
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,300
Don't any of these guys
ride in cars? Walk?

618
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,500
- How long are these things?
- What was he saying?

619
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,000
Hello. Yes, I'm trying
to reach Mr. Richard Scruggs.

620
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,300
This is Richard Scruggs.

621
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,200
Can you hold on
a second, please?

622
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,600
Lowell, got him
on the phone.

623
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,700
- Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.
- Hold on.

624
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,500
Mobile Approach, this is
Leo-November-643. Over.

625
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,800
Request a flight level
of 220...

626
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,500
on a heading
of 284 degrees. Over.

627
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,100
- Mr. Bergman?
- Yes, I'm right here.

628
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,800
- Could you call me back on a hard line?
- All right.

629
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:44,400
- Area code 212-555-0199.
<i>- I'll call you then.</i>

630
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,700
<i>What do we do with that?</i>

631
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,100
I don't know.

632
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,000
Richard Scruggs.

633
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,200
You filed a lawsuit against tobacco
on behalf of the state of Mississippi.

634
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,100
<i>- Did you not?</i>
- That's right.

635
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:06,600
<i>I'm working with someone now</i>
<i>who's the former head of</i>
<i>research at Brown & Williamson.</i>

636
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,100
<i>Former corporate officer there.</i>

637
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,100
What's your interest
in this, Mr. Bergman?

638
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,300
Well, he may tape
an interview with us,

639
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:16,600
and we believe if his testimony
showed up in a court record first,

640
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,600
<i>it would free him up from his</i>
<i>confidentiality agreement</i>
<i>and give him some protection.</i>

641
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,500
It could work. If it's public record,
it's public record.

642
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,800
<i>Yeah, and he's gonna need</i>
<i>legal representation.</i>

643
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,000
He sure as hell will.

644
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,700
Has he decided
to go public?

645
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,400
Because let me tell ya.
We been doin' this for three years now,

646
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,800
and we've worked with a lot of corporate
cases involving whistle-blowers.

647
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,000
So we know Big Tobacco will do
everything in their power to stop him.

648
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,100
So is your man
truly committed?

649
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,300
Well, actually, no... Well, he's
on the fence. That's the point.

650
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,200
Well, we'd certainly be interested
in making his acquaintance.

651
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,600
But without knowing
what he's gonna do...

652
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,900
Would you want him to call you, or you
wanna call him? How do you wanna do it?

653
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,700
It would be better
if he called us.

654
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,700
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right?

655
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,900
Okay. Thank you.
Shit.

656
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,400
We need cops on the streets.
We don't need them on horses.

657
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,300
- I don't know what he was thinking.
- For God's sake.

658
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,300
- This guy got a horse fetish?
- All right, all right.

659
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,500
Get me, uh...
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon.

660
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,700
I'll shoot
the fucking thing myself!

661
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,900
- Have a good one.
<i>- All right.</i>

662
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,800
<i>What are you cooking?</i>

663
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,600
- I'm cooking pasta primavera.
<i>- Oh, I love that stuff.</i>

664
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,900
I'm going to
have to go downstairs.

665
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,200
Jeffrey!

666
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,400
<i>Jeffrey! Jeffrey!</i>

667
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,700
<i>Jeffrey! Jeffrey!</i>

668
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,500
<i>- What happened?</i>
<i>- Dispatcher received a call</i>
<i>of shots fired in the area.</i>

669
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,100
Uniforms arrived on the scene, found
this white male subject shot to death.

670
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,300
- Was it gang related?
- There's no indication...

671
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,100
as far as a tag or an advertisement.

672
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,500
Yeah.

673
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,500
They're terrorizing us.
Death threats. My family, my kids.

674
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,400
Whoa. What are you
talking about?

675
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,800
- Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
- Jeff, call the F.B.I.

676
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,000
- Right away.
- They do this with impunity.

677
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,400
- Jeff...
- They get to go home at night.

678
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,100
What does it cost these people
to do this to us? Nothing!

679
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,600
My girls are crying.
So fuck them.

680
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,500
- I wanna tape. I'm done...
- I heard you.

681
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,100
I gotta arrange
for a legal defense first.

682
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,200
I gotta get you to testify in court,
get it on public record.

683
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,800
Then hold it off the air until you
got that, but I wanna go to New York,

684
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,100
and I wanna go on the record...
right now.

685
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:17,300
- Good. But, Jeff...
- I'll call them, Lowell.

686
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,200
Did you handle the round,
Mr. Wigand?

687
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,100
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

688
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,700
We won't be able to lift
usable prints.

689
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,000
Do you own a gun,
Mr. Wigand?

690
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,500
- A gun? Yes.
- What caliber is your gun?

691
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,800
What caliber is <i>my</i> gun?

692
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,700
Yes, sir.
What caliber is your gun?

693
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,600
What does that have to do
with the price of tea in China?

694
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,000
You think I put the bullet
in the mailbox myself?

695
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,500
If we could
take a look, Mr. Wigand.

696
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,000
Why do you keep this gun?

697
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,500
I don't think it's unconstitutional
yet to own a gun. I'm a target shooter.

698
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,500
That bullet was for a.38 caliber.
Do you own a.38?

699
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,500
<i>Yes, I do. A.38 Target Master</i>
<i>in my gun safe downstairs.</i>

700
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,500
A.45 Gold Cup,
a.22 target pistol. So what?

701
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,400
Do you have a history
of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?

702
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,400
Yeah. Yes, I do.

703
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,100
Yes, I get extremely emotional when
assholes put bullets in my mailbox.

704
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,200
I didn't tell you that so you could
pick it up and take it away.

705
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,600
- Jeffrey!
- What's going on?

706
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,500
I told them you had an e-mail
death threat that told you...

707
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,400
if you didn't shut the "F" up,
they were gonna kill you.

708
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,800
You can't take that. It's personal
property. My personal correspondence,

709
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,500
letters to my brother, my will.

710
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,400
You all right?

711
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,200
That computer has
every single...

712
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,400
<i>You all right, Mr. Wigand?</i>

713
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,400
We need to take a look
at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand.

714
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,600
I'm telling <i>you...</i> your agents
in that office are acting improperly.

715
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,400
Now who are they
trying to protect?

716
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,300
Let me, tell you something,
Lowell. Look, look.

717
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,700
You're talking about two agents
in a regional office in Louisville.

718
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,800
I got the goddamned Unabomber
threatening to blow up L.A.X.

719
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:53,000
I gotta move 45 agents
from all over the country into L.A.

720
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,800
All right? When I get a chance,
I'll give it a look.

721
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,700
You better take a good
look because I'm getting two things:

722
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,700
Pissed off and curious!

723
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,600
Now, any of these guys been offered jobs
in corporate security after they retire?

724
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,800
Either one of those guys got
ex-agent pals already in those jobs?

725
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,000
Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor
who's already at Brown & Williamson...

726
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,000
as we fuckin' speak!

727
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,900
- I'll give it a look.
- You're getting my drift?

728
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,800
I'll give it a look.

729
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,500
So is everything okay?

730
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,800
- How are the rooms? Comfortable?
- Yes, very.

731
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,900
Do you know,
I enjoy your work so much.

732
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,400
When you're talkin' to somebody,
I always feel like I'm right there.

733
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,600
Thank you for saying that.

734
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,700
Do you think we could
talk about the taping?

735
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:40,100
Tomorrow's taping? Just so we
can get it out of the way and order.

736
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,100
Yeah, well, questions will go
towards what work you did there,
why you were fired and other...

737
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,500
Taping?

738
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:55,000
- What are you taping?
- I'm doin' an interview.

739
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,900
An interview?

740
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,800
Do you know what
they will do to us?

741
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,700
I thought we...

742
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,300
I'm sorry.

743
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,200
Liane, this is
a preliminary...

744
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,300
You didn't
tell her we were taping?

745
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,900
What did she think she was
coming to New York for?

746
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,300
Talk about it, think about it.
I had a plan to, uh, ease her into it,

747
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,100
but I really...
I don't know how to do that.

748
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,000
Oh, man.

749
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,800
Who are these people?

750
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,600
Ordinary people under
extraordinary pressure, Mike.

751
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,000
What the hell you expect,
grace and consistency?

752
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,100
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

753
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,600
You heard Mr. Sandefur say...

754
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,200
before Congress that he believed
nicotine was not addictive.

755
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:45,100
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

756
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,000
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

757
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,200
<i> All of us did. I mean,</i>
<i>there was this whole line of people,</i>

758
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,600
<i>whole line of C.E.O. 's</i>
<i>up there swearing.</i>

759
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,600
<i>Part of the reason</i>
<i>I'm here is that I felt...</i>

760
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,000
that their representation
clearly misstated...

761
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,900
at least within Brown & Williamson's
representation...

762
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:06,200
clearly misstated what is common
language within the company.

763
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,400
We are in
the nicotine delivery business.

764
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,500
And that's what
cigarettes are for.

765
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,700
Delivery device for nicotine.

766
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,700
A delivery device
for nicotine.

767
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,400
Put it in your mouth, light it up
and you're going to get your fix.

768
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,800
- You're gonna get your fix.
<i>- You're saying that</i>
<i>Brown & Williamson...</i>

769
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,800
<i>manipulates and adjusts</i>
<i>the nicotine fix...</i>

770
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,700
not by artificially
adding nicotine,

771
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:29,700
but by enhancing
the effect of nicotine...

772
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:34,100
<i>through the use</i>
<i>of chemical elements such as ammonia.</i>

773
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,700
The process is known
as impact boosting.

774
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,400
<i>While not spiking nicotine,</i>

775
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,300
<i>they clearly manipulate it.</i>

776
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,700
There is extensive use of this
technology, known as ammonia chemistry.

777
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,100
It allows for the nicotine to be
more rapidly absorbed in the lung...

778
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,700
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

779
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,200
<i>The straw that broke the camel's</i>
<i>back for me and really put me</i>
<i>in trouble with Sandefur...</i>

780
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,900
was a compound called coumarin.

781
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,800
When I came on board
at B&W,

782
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:09,500
they had tried to transition
from coumarin to a similar flavor...

783
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:13,000
that would give the same taste
and had been unsuccessful.

784
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,600
I wanted it out immediately.
I was told...

785
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,500
that it would effect sales, so
I should mind my own business.

786
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,400
I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
indicating I could not in conscience...

787
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,100
continue with coumarin
in a product that we now knew...

788
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:30,600
we had documentation... was similar to
coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen.

789
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,200
And you sent the document
forward to Sandefur?

790
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,100
I sent the document
forward to Sandefur.

791
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,500
I was told that we would
continue to work on a substitute.

792
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,200
We weren't going to remove it
as it would impact sales
and that that was his decision.

793
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,800
<i> In other words,</i>
<i>you are charging Sandefur...</i>

794
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,700
and Brown & Williamson...

795
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,000
with ignoring health
considerations consciously?

796
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,100
- Most certainly.
- And on March 24,

797
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,800
Thomas Sandefur,
C.E.O. Of Brown & Williamson,

798
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,000
had you fired.

799
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,400
<i>And the reason</i>
<i>he gave you?</i>

800
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,400
Poor communication skills.

801
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,000
And you wish
you hadn't come forward?

802
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,500
You wish you hadn't
blown the whistle?

803
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,400
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

804
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:24,300
There are times I feel com...
compelled to do it.

805
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,100
If you'd asked me...

806
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,700
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

807
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,400
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

808
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

809
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,600
My name is Jeff Wigand.

810
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,300
You can call me, uh,
Mr. Wigand.

811
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,200
You can call me
Dr. Wigand.

812
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,700
I have a Ph.D. In biochemistry
and endocrinology.

813
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,400
You can call me Jeff.

814
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,800
Anything else you want to call me,
you'll have to do so in private.

815
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:34,500
Um, okay.

816
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,600
I find chemistry
to be magical.

817
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,700
I find it an adventure.

818
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:43,100
An exploration into the building
blocks of our physical universe.

819
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,400
So how many of you have
taken chemistry before?

820
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,200
Okay. I've never taught it
before, so we're gonna be fine.

821
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,000
Our first experiment
is gonna be measuring...

822
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,000
the molecular weight
of butane.

823
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,400
He's on line three.

824
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:07,500
- Hello?
- Mr. Scruggs? Jeff Wigand.

825
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,400
Lowell Bergman said
I should give you a call.

826
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,900
My co-counsel,
Ron Motley and I,

827
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,300
have filed a lawsuit against
the tobacco industry on behalf
of the state of Mississippi...

828
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,800
to get the state
reimbursed Medicaid costs...

829
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,300
for treatin' people
with smoking-related illness.

830
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,400
If you'd be interested
in talkin' to us,

831
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,700
we'd certainly like
to talk to you.

832
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,300
When should we do this?

833
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,500
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing in my house?

834
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,000
<i>- It's okay, Jeff. It's okay.</i>
- Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...

835
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,300
You've got
your own security now.

836
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,500
You know, Lowell,
I can't... I can't afford to...

837
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,700
No, they volunteered.
A friend owns a large security company.

838
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:12,600
<i>How're you doing, Mr. Wigand?</i>
<i>I'm John Telafarro.</i>

839
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,500
There'll be three of us
on the detail.

840
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:19,500
I'm going to the store. Please explain
our new houseguests to your children.

841
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,400
Mrs. Wigand's leaving the house.

842
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:31,100
Uh, I called Richard Scruggs
in Mississippi.

843
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,400
- I heard.
- I'm gonna be a witness for them
in their litigation.

844
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,800
So I'm gonna fly to Pascagoula,
give a deposition.

845
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,000
I know. I'm gonna
go there tonight.

846
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,500
<i>You all right?</i>

847
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,000
- Did you have a good day?
- Yes, I did. I had a great day.

848
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,500
<i>- Uh, coffee, Lowell?</i>
- Yeah, all right.

849
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,800
Wanna play that game
we were playing before?

850
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,600
You know, I think you
got it up to five.

851
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,900
<i>I was ahead of you,</i>
<i>and then you just...</i>

852
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,100
Please don't wash your hands
in the sink.

853
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,200
Where should I wash them?

854
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,500
Use the bathroom.

855
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,400
What's the difference?

856
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,300
That's for food.

857
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,300
Leave it on.
Just leave it on! Okay?

858
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,200
I don't think
I can do this.

859
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,500
I want to stand by
my husband.

860
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,800
I really do, Jeffrey,
but...

861
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,900
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

862
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,900
I am so sorry.

863
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,300
Can we talk about this
when I get back?

864
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,500
Yes, Jeffrey.

865
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,900
It's okay.

866
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,100
Jeff!

867
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,400
You've been served.

868
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,000
Now, what this one is is
a temporary restraining order,

869
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,500
a gag order,
issued by a Kentucky court.

870
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,000
Jeff Wigand,
Michael Moore.

871
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,900
Good to meet you,
Dr. Wigand.

872
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,900
<i>Mike's our attorney general</i>
<i>down here.</i>

873
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,100
<i>I was just explaining to Jeff</i>
<i>they got a Kentucky court...</i>

874
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,900
<i>to issue a gag order</i>
<i>to stop his deposition today.</i>

875
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,000
<i>- Right.</i>
- Now,

876
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,400
they tried to get
the Mississippi court to honor it,

877
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,300
but the judge threw it out.

878
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:29,100
However, for you, there is a more
perilous effect of the gag order.

879
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:33,000
Dr. Wigand, you do understand
what can happen, don't you?

880
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,700
I'm not free to testify...
here.

881
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,400
That's right. If you violate
the Kentucky order,

882
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,500
when you
step foot back in Kentucky...

883
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,500
they can find you in contempt
and they can incarcerate you.

884
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,300
And you ought to know that.

885
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,100
- Jail.
- Possibly, yes.

886
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
That is one of the possible consequences
of your testifying here today.

887
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
That's right.

888
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,300
How does...
How does one go to jail?

889
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:11,800
Wh-What does my family do?

890
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,200
Go on welfare?

891
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:17,400
If my wife has to work,
who's gonna look after the kids?

892
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,900
Put food on the table?
I mean, my children need me.

893
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,100
If I'm not teaching,
there's no medical.

894
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
No medical, even on co-pay,
that's like... Tuition...

895
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,700
Dr. Wigand, listen.

896
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,100
You may not be able
to do this thing.

897
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,800
As I understand from Dick,
you're our key witness,

898
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,200
and I hope
you don't withdraw.

899
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,600
Um, I guess we'd all
understand if you did.

900
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,900
Guys, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for court.

901
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:46,200
I'll see y'all later.
Dr. Wigand, good luck.

902
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,000
I know what you're facing,
Jeff.

903
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And I think I know
how you're feeling.

904
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,100
In the navy, I flew
A-6's off carriers.

905
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:09,400
In combat, events have
a duration of seconds.

906
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,600
Sometimes minutes.

907
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,400
But what you're going through
goes on day in, day out,

908
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,600
whether you're
ready for it or not.

909
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,500
Week in, week out.

910
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,100
Month after month
after month.

911
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:24,600
Whether you're up
or whether you're down.

912
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,500
You're assaulted
psychologically.

913
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,800
You're assaulted
financially,

914
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:34,500
which is its own special kind
of violence because it's
directed at your kids.

915
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,700
What school can you afford?

916
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,100
How will that
affect their lives?

917
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,000
You're asking yourself,

918
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,300
"Will that limit
what they may become?"

919
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,900
You feel your whole family's future
is compromised,

920
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,400
held hostage.

921
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,500
I do know how it is.

922
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,200
You attract a crowd.

923
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,200
Yeah.
Great.

924
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:14,000
I heard about
the Kentucky gag order.

925
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,800
I don't know what to do.

926
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,000
Hold on a second.

927
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,900
Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he
expects his witness to appear or not?

928
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:56,200
I can't seem to find
the criteria to decide.

929
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,300
It's too big a decision to make
without being resolved in my own mind.

930
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,400
Maybe things have changed.

931
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,600
A lot's changed.

932
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,500
You mean since this morning?

933
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,900
No, I mean since whenever.

934
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,200
Fuck it.

935
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,300
Let's go to court.

936
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,000
<i>Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.</i>

937
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,000
Okay, Jeff. I'm gonna sit you down
at that table over there.

938
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,900
I want to start
as fast as possible.

939
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,200
I don't want to give them a chance to
get another restraining order. Okay?

940
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,200
- Let's go.
- Good luck, Doc.

941
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,700
Please stand.
Raise your right hand.

942
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:36,800
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

943
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,800
<i>- I do.</i>
<i>- You may be seated.</i>

944
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,600
<i>You understand, Dr. Wigand,</i>
<i>you are under oath?</i>

945
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:46,600
This is a sworn deposition.
There's no judge. It's not a trial.

946
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,600
Will you state your name
for the record?

947
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,100
Jeffrey S. Wigand.
R-E-Y. W-I-G-A-N-D.

948
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,800
Got any idea what's
going on in there?

949
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,700
No, I don't have
a clue.

950
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,200
- That is correct.
- In other words, it acts as a drug,

951
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,400
- Object to the form of the question.
- It acts as a drug...

952
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,200
- Object to the form...
- It acts as a drug...

953
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,300
- Object!
- Is there an echo in here?

954
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,300
<i>Your objection's been recorded.</i>

955
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:16,400
<i>She typed it into her little machine</i>
<i>over there. It's on the record.</i>

956
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,900
<i>So now I'll proceed</i>
<i>with my deposition of my witness.</i>

957
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,800
- Does it act as a drug?
- Dr. Wigand!

958
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,300
I am instructing you...

959
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,700
<i>not to answer that question.</i>

960
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,300
In accordance to the terms of
the contractual obligations...

961
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,800
<i>undertaken by you...</i>

962
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,700
<i>not to disclose</i>
<i>any information...</i>

963
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:43,400
about your work at the Brown
& Williamson Tobacco Company.

964
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:46,600
And in accordance
with the force and effect...

965
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,500
of the temporary
restraining order...

966
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,700
<i>that has been</i>
<i>entered against you...</i>

967
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,500
<i>by the court</i>
<i>in the state of Kentucky.</i>

968
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,100
That means you don't talk.

969
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,100
Mr. Motley, we have rights here.

970
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,400
Oh, you've got rights.

971
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:05,400
And lefts.
Ups and downs and middles.

972
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:10,000
So what? You don't get
to instruct anything around here!

973
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:14,100
This is not North Carolina,
not South Carolina, nor Kentucky.

974
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,400
This is the sovereign state
of Mississippi's proceeding.

975
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,200
Wipe that smirk off your face!

976
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:24,100
Dr. Wigand's deposition
will be part of this record!

977
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:28,000
And I'm gonna take my witness' testimony
whether the hell you like it or not!

978
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,300
Answer the question,
Doctor.

979
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:48,400
<i>Yes. It produces</i>
<i>a physiological response, which</i>
<i>meets the definition of a drug.</i>

980
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,500
Um, nicotine
is associated with...

981
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,900
impact, satisfaction.

982
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:58,400
It has a pharmacological effect that
crosses the blood-brain barrier intact.

983
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,900
<i>Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.</i>

984
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,300
One of the reasons
I'm here is that I felt...

985
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,500
that their representation
clearly...

986
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:57,700
Run that Sandefur piece
on "nicotine's not addictive."

987
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,200
Run that on camera, then cut right to
Wigand with "I believe they perjured..."

988
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,000
Then go wide to the C.E.O. S
all taking the oath.

989
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,900
Then back on Jeff...

990
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,300
and play the pause after
the word "felt" on the B-side.

991
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:12,600
Hell of a show, Mike.
Explosive material.

992
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,300
- It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
- Good.

993
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,400
- I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

994
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:23,800
They argued that he was going
to reveal the secret formula
of Kools to the world.

995
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,600
<i>Sealed doesn't hurt Scruggs’ litigation,</i>

996
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,200
<i>and since we're the only ones</i>
<i>with the story, I believe</i>
<i>we're sitting on an exclusive.</i>

997
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:34,500
I like that.
<i>Corporate has some questions.</i>

998
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,900
<i>We've got a meeting at "Black Rock"</i>
<i>first thing in the morning.</i>

999
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:40,900
- When's the air date?
<i>- Lowell, Sharon's on line three.</i>

1000
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,900
- Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
<i>- Here we go.</i>

1001
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:47,200
That they had long
known that the nicotine in tobacco...

1002
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:51,500
is an addictive drug despite their
public statements to the contrary.

1003
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:55,100
Like the testimony before Congress
of Dr. Wigand's former boss,

1004
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:59,000
Brown & Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

1005
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,400
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

1006
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,000
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

1007
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:06,400
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

1008
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,900
All of us did.
There was this whole line of people,

1009
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,200
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

1010
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,900
Part of the reason
I'm here is that I felt...

1011
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
that their representation
clearly misstated...

1012
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,300
what is common language
within the company.

1013
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,500
We are in the nicotine
delivery business.

1014
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:26,000
<i>There is extensive use of this</i>
<i>technology, known as ammonia chemistry.</i>

1015
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,900
<i>It allows for the nicotine to be</i>
<i>more rapidly absorbed in the lung...</i>

1016
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:32,400
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

1017
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,400
That's what cigarettes are for.
- Delivery device for nicotine.

1018
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,300
A delivery device
for nicotine. Put it in your mouth,

1019
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:40,200
light it up and
you're going to get your fix.

1020
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,500
You're going to get your fix.

1021
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:42,100
- Shall I send for coffee?
Sorry I'm late.
- No, we're fine.

1022
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:44,900
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1023
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,100
All right. I thought
we'd get together...

1024
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,000
because there's
a legal concept...

1025
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,700
that has been getting
some new attention recently.

1026
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,800
Tortious interference.

1027
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,600
<i>If two people have an agreement,</i>
<i>like a confidentiality agreement,</i>

1028
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,900
and one of them breaks it because they
are induced to do so by a third party,

1029
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,900
the third party can be sued
for damages for interfering.

1030
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,000
Hence, tortious interference.

1031
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,100
"Interfering"?
That's what we do.

1032
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,800
<i>I think what we're trying to tell you</i>
<i>is that it happens all the time.</i>

1033
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,800
This is a news organization. People are
always telling us things they shouldn't.

1034
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:20,900
We have to verify if it's true
and in the public interest.
And if it is, we air it.

1035
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:25,100
And after we corroborate it.
That's why we've never lost
a lawsuit and run a classy show.

1036
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:29,900
- Anything else?
- And <i>60 Minutes'</i> verification
is exact and precise.

1037
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:33,700
And I don't think it would hurt
to make sure you're right on this one.

1038
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,500
<i>Why? You think we have liability?</i>

1039
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,500
What's the CBS News position,
Eric?

1040
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,600
There's a possibility.
It's rather remote.

1041
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,600
But one we
have to check on, Mike.

1042
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:47,100
I've retained outside counsel
to do exactly that...

1043
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:51,700
on a segment, I might add,
that's already rife with problems.

1044
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,500
What does that mean?
"Rife with..."

1045
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,700
I'm told unusual promises
were made to Wigand.

1046
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,800
No, only that we would hold his story
until it was safe for him.

1047
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,900
And I'm told there are questions
as to our star witness' veracity.

1048
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,700
His "veracity" was good enough
for the state of Mississippi.

1049
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:08,200
Our standards have to be
higher than anyone else's,

1050
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,200
because we are the standard
for everybody else.

1051
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:16,300
Well, as a "standard," I'll hang with
"is this guy telling the truth?"

1052
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,900
Well, with tortious interference,
I'm afraid...

1053
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:22,400
the greater the truth,
the greater the damage.

1054
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:26,100
- Come again?
- They own...

1055
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,600
the information he's disclosing.

1056
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,600
The truer it is,

1057
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,700
the greater
the damage to them.

1058
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:36,300
If he lied, he didn't
disclose their information,
and the damages are smaller.

1059
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,900
- Is this <i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>
- You said "on this one."

1060
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:47,700
What about this one?

1061
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,300
<i>If this holds up...</i>
<i>And it very well may not, Mike.</i>

1062
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:54,600
But if it did
and we aired this segment,

1063
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:58,500
and CBS was sued
by Brown & Williamson,

1064
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,500
I think we could be
at grave risk.

1065
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:04,300
- How grave?
<i>- Well, at the end of the day,</i>

1066
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,900
because of your segment,

1067
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,300
the Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Company...

1068
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:11,300
could own CBS.

1069
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:16,100
Oh. You know,

1070
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:20,000
I am sorry,
but I'm due upstairs.

1071
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:22,900
Is CBS Corporate
telling CBS News...

1072
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,300
"Do not go to air
with this story"?

1073
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,900
You're getting ahead of yourself.
We're all in this together.

1074
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:32,100
We're all CBS.
We'll find out soon.

1075
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,900
Thank you, gentlemen.

1076
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:42,600
"Tortious interference."

1077
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:45,700
That sounds like a disease
caught by a radio.

1078
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,100
<i>- Lunch?</i>
- Sure.

1079
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,400
Don't worry.
We call the shots around here.

1080
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:05,700
Hello?

1081
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,500
Debbie, it's me. I want
you to check some filings,

1082
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,900
and give me John Wilson's number
at Bear-Stearn.

1083
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:21,200
- What now?
- Kluster's coming over.

1084
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,400
<i>Hello, Lowell, Mike.</i>

1085
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,700
<i>Don.</i>

1086
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:37,000
There has been so much soul searching
about this Wigand.

1087
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,200
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of
the show without his interview.

1088
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,200
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of
the show without his interview.

1089
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:45,800
So what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
checking with outside counsel first?

1090
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:47,600
- All that crap?
- That's happening.

1091
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,200
Hopefully, we won't have to use
the alternate, but we should
have it in the can.

1092
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,500
- I'm not touching my film.
- I'm afraid you are.

1093
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:56,600
- No, I'm not.
- We're doing this
with or without you, Lowell.

1094
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,500
If you like, I can assign
another producer to edit your show.

1095
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:04,400
Since when has the, uh,

1096
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:07,800
paragon of
investigative journalism...

1097
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:11,900
allowed lawyers to determine
the news content on <i>60 Minutes?</i>

1098
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:14,300
<i>It's an alternate version.</i>

1099
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,900
So what if we have
an alternate version?

1100
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,500
And I don't think our being cautious
is so damned unreasonable.

1101
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,600
So now, if you will
excuse me, gentlemen,

1102
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:25,200
Mr. Rather's been complaining
about his chair again.

1103
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:28,000
Before you go,

1104
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,800
I discovered this.

1105
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:37,200
S.E.C. Filing for the sale of CBS
Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.

1106
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:39,400
- What?
- Yeah, I heard rumors.

1107
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,500
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.
If Tisch can unload CBS...

1108
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,800
for $81 a share
to Westinghouse,

1109
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,700
and then is
suddenly threatened...

1110
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:50,500
with a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit from Brown & Williamson,

1111
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:52,300
that could screw up the sale,
could it not?

1112
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:56,200
<i>- What are you implying?</i>
- I'm not implying. I'm quoting.

1113
01:41:56,100 --> 01:42:00,000
Uh, " More vested interests. Persons
who will profit from this merger.

1114
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:05,100
"Ms. Helen Caperelli, general counsel
of CBS News, 3.9 million.

1115
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,100
"Mr. Eric Kluster,
president of CBS News,

1116
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,900
1.4 million."

1117
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:14,000
<i> Are you suggesting that</i>
<i>she and Eric are influenced by money?</i>

1118
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:17,900
No, no, of course they're not
influenced by money. They work for free.

1119
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,300
And you are a volunteer
executive producer.

1120
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:24,200
CBS does not do that. And you're
questioning our journalistic integrity.

1121
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:26,000
No, I'm questioning
your hearing.

1122
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,300
You hear "reasonable"
and "tortious interference."

1123
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:31,500
I hear "potential Brown
& Williamson lawsuit...

1124
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:34,400
jeopardizing the sale
of CBS to Westinghouse."

1125
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:37,800
I hear "Shut the segment down.
Cut Wigand loose.

1126
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:40,500
Obey orders and fuck off."
That's what I hear.

1127
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,400
<i>- You're exaggerating.</i>
- I am?

1128
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:45,100
You pay me
to go get guys like Wigand,

1129
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:49,000
to draw him out, to get him to trust
us, to get him to go on television.

1130
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,700
I do. I deliver him.
He sits. He talks.

1131
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:55,100
He violates his own fucking
confidentiality agreement.

1132
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,100
And he's only the key witness in the
biggest public health reform issue,

1133
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,100
maybe the biggest,
most expensive...

1134
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
corporate malfeasance case
in U.S. History.

1135
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,300
And Jeffrey Wigand,
who's out on a limb,

1136
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,600
does he go on television
and tell the truth?

1137
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,900
Yes.
Is it newsworthy?

1138
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:13,600
Yes.
Are we gonna air it?

1139
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,500
Of course not. Why?

1140
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,800
Because he's not
telling the truth? No.

1141
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:21,600
<i>Because he is telling the truth.</i>
<i>That's why we're not gonna air it.</i>

1142
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,800
And the more truth he tells,
the worse it gets.

1143
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:27,700
<i> You are a fanatic,</i>
<i>an anarchist. You know that?</i>

1144
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,200
If we can't have a whole show, then
I want half a show rather than no show.

1145
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,800
But, oh, no. Not you. You
won't be satisfied unless you're
putting the company at risk!

1146
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,000
What are you? Are you a businessman
or are you a newsman?

1147
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:40,200
Because that happens to be
what Mike and I...

1148
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,800
and some other people
around here do for a living.

1149
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,400
<i>- Lowell...</i>
- Put the corporation at risk?
Give me a fucking break!

1150
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,500
These people are
putting our whole reason...

1151
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:51,200
- for doing what we do on the line!
- Lowell!

1152
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,200
What?

1153
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:55,400
I'm with Don
on this.

1154
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,800
What's wrong?

1155
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:21,300
They're killing
the Wigand interview.

1156
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:25,600
- What?
- They're pretending it's process.
That's bullshit. It's foregone.

1157
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,600
What are you and Mike
gonna do?

1158
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:35,800
I'm alone on this.

1159
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:39,000
- Oh, baby.
- Yeah.

1160
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,900
It's Jeffrey Wigand.

1161
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:21,700
Jeffrey.
How are you?

1162
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,700
How's the family?
Okay?

1163
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:26,700
- There is... There is no family.
- What do you mean, "there is no family"?

1164
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,900
Uh, Liane has filed for divorce.

1165
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:32,200
And, so,
I've moved out.

1166
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,800
I see the girls
a couple of days a week.

1167
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:40,100
- Where are you staying now?
- Our favorite hotel, honey.

1168
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:44,000
I checked into room 930.

1169
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:45,900
Odd choice, huh?

1170
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,600
I don't know how
to say this,

1171
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,900
Jeff, except to just
say it right out.

1172
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:58,100
So, uh, I'll say it.
They do not want to air it.

1173
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:05,000
- What?
- B&W may have threatened litigation.

1174
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,400
CBS is on the block.

1175
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,500
- But you, I mean... I know how you...
- No.

1176
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,500
No, what?

1177
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:18,300
I do not think that you know for me
what it is to walk in my shoes.

1178
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:22,800
For my kids
to have seen it,

1179
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:25,700
for them to know why I've
put them through what I did.

1180
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:29,200
The public airing of that,
the testament to why I did what I did.

1181
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:32,100
You're telling me it's not
gonna see the light of day?

1182
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:34,800
Jeff.

1183
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,500
Mrs. Wigand?

1184
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:22,300
It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand
for some time.

1185
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:27,000
I'm an investigator, and I was
wondering if I could ask you a
couple of questions about that.

1186
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:30,500
All right.

1187
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:36,800
Um, seven months
after we were married,

1188
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:39,100
we found out that I had
multiple sclerosis.

1189
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:41,000
<i>And you had a daughter, Diane...</i>

1190
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:43,000
<i>Tommy Sandefur told me himself.</i>

1191
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,500
<i>He's not going to allow Brown</i>
<i>& Williamson to be demonized</i>
<i>to the American public.</i>

1192
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:50,300
So I told Pete Jennings.
And I... Hold on.

1193
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:53,900
You had multiple sclerosis.
You had a small child to raise.

1194
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,900
Uh, mention that part in the
executive summary and in the chapters.

1195
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,200
First wife
and estrangement of daughter.

1196
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:02,500
So I was telling Pete, I said,
"You've been taken in by this guy."

1197
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,200
The divorce was something
that we both wanted.

1198
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:08,900
He's a shoplifter.

1199
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:11,300
He's a convicted
shoplifter.

1200
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,300
So, um, what are you
gonna do?

1201
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:35,500
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Quit in protest?

1202
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,600
I'm not gonna do that.

1203
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,500
You're taking "no"
for an answer?

1204
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,500
No, I'm not gonna take
"no" for an answer. No.

1205
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:45,500
You're not?
What <i>are</i> you doing?

1206
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:49,000
I'm staying right here, doing my job.
Fighting to get my show on the air.

1207
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:51,600
You don't like it?
Hey, I tell you what?

1208
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,700
Fire my ass.

1209
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:58,300
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with
Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?

1210
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:05,000
I don't think so.
Take a look at this.

1211
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,800
This is a summary of a dossier
that's being prepared.

1212
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,000
He wouldn't lie
about his whole life.

1213
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,700
Who's gonna believe him
about anything he says?

1214
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:16,500
<i>The</i> Wall Street Journal <i>is doing</i>
<i>a major story, and, I think, the</i> Post.

1215
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,700
You backed the wrong horse.

1216
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:24,000
The version without the interview
is gonna air the week after next.

1217
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:32,300
What was that about?

1218
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:34,300
- Get me Wigand.
- Sure.

1219
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:40,900
What the fuck is this?
Fuck!

1220
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:43,100
You never told me
you were married before.

1221
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:46,300
- That you had a daughter.
- How is that any of your business?

1222
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,600
That is not something
that you people need to know.

1223
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,500
Oh, you know what we do
or do not need to know?

1224
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,900
- Since when have you become
a media expert?
- What do you wanna do, Lowell?

1225
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:55,200
- Look up my ass too?
- Oh, for God's sake.

1226
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,900
- You're not even on this anymore.
What do you care?
- Jeff, wake the fuck up!

1227
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:01,400
Everybody is on the line here.
If they catch you in a lie,

1228
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:04,100
they can paint everything with
that brush, you understand?

1229
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,500
- Everything you say.
- I told the truth.

1230
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:10,000
Everything you say.
And I can't defend you, man,

1231
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,900
with one hand tied
behind my back...

1232
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:14,500
because you keep from me
what they can discover.

1233
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:17,200
And they will discover
everything. Believe me.

1234
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,300
I was young!
I was young!

1235
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:22,300
Confused. We didn't
handle it the right way.

1236
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:25,100
- She sued you for back payments
of child support?
- She did not sue me.

1237
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,200
We had a dispute over money. I settled
it. She dropped the complaint.

1238
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
- Any other questions?
- Yes. Did you lie...

1239
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:34,200
about being on the American
judo team in the Olympics?

1240
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:37,200
- What?
- Some public relations guy...

1241
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:39,200
got hold of a tape of an interview
where you're saying...

1242
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:41,800
you were on the American
judo team in the Olympics.

1243
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:44,900
What kind of shit is this?
I... I was...

1244
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,300
I was not <i>on</i> the team.
I <i>sparred</i> with the Olympic team.

1245
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:51,300
- Okay?
- All right. ABC Telemarketing Company?

1246
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:54,900
- ABC...
- ABC Telemarketing Company.

1247
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,700
The can opener!
A 39.95 can opener!

1248
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:00,400
I cancelled payment.
It was junk!

1249
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:03,500
You ever bounce a check, Lowell?
You ever look at another woman's tits?

1250
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,700
You ever cheat a little
on your taxes?

1251
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:09,200
Whose life, if you look at it under
a microscope, doesn't have any flaws?

1252
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:11,700
Well, that's the whole point, Jeffrey.
That's the whole point.

1253
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:15,500
Anyone's, everyone's.
They are gonna look under every rock,

1254
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:19,200
dig up every flaw,
every mistake you've ever made.

1255
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:23,100
They are going to distort and exaggerate
everything you've ever done, man.

1256
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,700
- Don't you understand?
- What does this have to do
with my testimony?

1257
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:27,800
- That's not the point...
- What does it have to do
with my testimony?

1258
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:30,500
- I told the truth!
It's true and provable!
- It's not about...

1259
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:33,900
That's not the fucking point,
whether you told the truth or not!

1260
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,200
Hello?

1261
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,200
I told the truth.

1262
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:45,700
I told the truth.

1263
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:49,500
I gotta teach class. I gotta go.

1264
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:53,200
- I gotta teach class.
- And I gotta refute every
fucking accusation made...

1265
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,000
in this report before
the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> runs.

1266
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,600
I am trying to protect you,
man.

1267
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,500
I hope you improve
your batting average.

1268
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:26,400
<i>They're cutting the interest rate,</i>
<i>and I have that great feature...</i>

1269
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,300
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1270
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:38,900
Are you guys planning to do a piece on
a former top executive in Big Tobacco?

1271
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:41,700
- You caught me in a news meeting.
- Are you, are you not, Charlie?

1272
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,600
You bet we are,
and I can't talk to you now.

1273
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:46,600
- We gotta hook up.
- Sure. Where?

1274
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:49,300
- P.J.'s.
- I'll be there.

1275
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,600
Yeah, I got it.
Five hundred pages of it.

1276
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:02,200
They looked in every corner
of this guy's life,
from the spousal abuse charge,

1277
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:05,900
to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket
he got once for running a red light.

1278
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,300
It's Terry Lenzner's outfit,
I.G.I. Jack, listen to me.

1279
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:13,900
Their strategy: Discredit
this guy, ruin his reputation
in the <i>Wall Street Journal...</i>

1280
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:17,100
and then nobody will ever listen
to what he's got to say about tobacco.

1281
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,100
He's dead unless I can
get this thing knocked down.

1282
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:22,500
Make it even
a little more attractive.

1283
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:25,100
I don't know if you're
ever gonna get paid.

1284
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:27,700
- Is there any truth to any of it?
- That's a good question.

1285
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:30,100
"Is there any truth to any of it?"
I doubt it.

1286
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,500
- What's the deadline?
- Soon.

1287
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:40,000
- Fax me the summary.
- That's great, Jack.

1288
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:49,900
- Hey. How are you? Hey, listen.
- Hey.

1289
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:53,000
I hear you guys are sitting
on something sensational over there.

1290
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,600
- Really? Hi, June.
- Oh, hi, baby.

1291
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,300
- Catch you later.
- Okay. Take care.

1292
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,900
- When's your deadline?
- Monday.

1293
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:06,800
- Push it.
- What? Forget it.

1294
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,700
It's a smear campaign,
Charlie.

1295
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:10,600
- It's drawn from
a selectively circulated...
- Oh, yeah.

1296
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:13,600
Real selective. About as hard to get
ahold of as the Manhattan phone book.

1297
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:17,400
Well, it's authoritive...
and overwhelmingly documented.

1298
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:20,400
And it's bullshit. And if
I'm right, are you gonna put...

1299
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:23,400
the <i>Journal's</i> reputation behind a story
that's gonna blow up in your face?

1300
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:27,300
I'll take a look at what you got
but I'm not moving any deadlines
because you say so.

1301
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,300
Are you all right?

1302
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,300
Yeah.

1303
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:51,600
Officer Muravchick?

1304
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:54,600
Thank you.

1305
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,000
Officer Muravchick,
how are you?

1306
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,100
- I'm Sandra Sutherland.
- How do you do?

1307
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,100
Fine, thank you.
I'm doing a background check.

1308
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,000
Mind if I sit down?

1309
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,800
Your Honor,
could I have a word with you?

1310
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,500
You presided in a dispute
over support payments.

1311
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:15,700
Jeffrey Wigand?
Yeah, I cited him.

1312
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:19,700
CBS is under criticism because
the CBS News program, <i>60 Minutes,</i>

1313
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,600
will not be presenting
an interview...

1314
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:24,400
What the hell
are you doing?

1315
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,400
What does it look like
I'm doing? I'm editing.

1316
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,300
No, no, no that. I'm talking
about the Associated Press.

1317
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:33,800
They got the story that
we pulled this interview,
and they talked to Mike and I.

1318
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:35,700
Did you tell them
that we were lying?

1319
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:37,700
No!
I should have.

1320
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,800
I told them I disagreed
with you, Mike and Kluster...

1321
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,600
that this segment
is as good as the original.

1322
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:44,700
<i>I'm not lying for you.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna shut up for you.</i>

1323
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:47,600
<i>- Not on any of it.</i>
- Hey, I'm not gonna fire you.

1324
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:50,600
Okay? Take a vacation. Now!

1325
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:57,600
<i>Lowell? Look, I've decided</i>
<i>to preface Sunday's show.</i>

1326
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:00,300
I did three minutes on the
<i>Evening News.</i> You'll want to see it.

1327
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:03,300
- Where are you going?
- I've been banished...

1328
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,400
<i>in lieu of being fired.</i>

1329
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:09,400
<i>I took off on Tisch.</i>
<i>I took off on Corporate.</i>

1330
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,000
They'll know they're not, uh, going
to see everything on Sunday night.

1331
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:16,300
I don't know. How does that
get Wigand on the air?

1332
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:18,400
Do me a favor,
will you? Spare me.

1333
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,900
For God's sake, get in the
real world. What do you think?

1334
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,400
I'm going to resign in protest
to force it on the air?

1335
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:27,200
The answer's no. I don't plan
to spend the end of my days...

1336
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:30,200
wandering in the wilderness
of National Public Radio.

1337
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,100
That decision
I've already made.

1338
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:36,300
<i> This Sunday,</i>
<i>Wallace will broadcast a report...</i>

1339
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:40,500
<i>on the tobacco industry,</i>
<i>including the tough tactics</i>
<i>tobacco companies employ...</i>

1340
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,200
to keep a lid on information
that might be damaging.

1341
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:46,000
Is there information
that people should have...

1342
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,300
that they're not going to have
because you're not going to
broadcast this interview?

1343
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:54,200
- Yes.
- Today, CBS News president
Eric Kluster...

1344
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:57,000
<i>defended the network's decision</i>
<i>not to broadcast...</i>

1345
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,800
<i>key portions</i>
<i>of the controversial interview.</i>

1346
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,600
<i>Mr. Kluster said, quote,</i>
<i>"The atmosphere is tougher than ever."</i>

1347
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:05,000
- Where's the rest?
- Dan.

1348
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,900
Where the hell's the rest?

1349
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:09,900
<i>- Nebraska football</i>

<i>Bernard Goldberg's America.</i>

1351
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:15,700
- You cut the guts out of what I said!
- It was a time consideration...

1352
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:18,400
Time? Bullshit!
You corporate lackey.

1353
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:22,200
Who told <i>you</i> your incompetent
little fingers have the
requisite skills to edit me?

1354
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,900
I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation
here, and you're too dim...

1355
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:27,200
Mike. Mike. Mike.

1356
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:31,300
"Mike"? Mike!

1357
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,900
Try "Mr. Wallace."

1358
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:36,800
We work in the same corporation. Doesn't
mean we work in the same profession.

1359
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:39,200
Now, now what are you going to do now?
You going to finesse me?

1360
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:43,500
Lawyer me some more? I've been
in this profession 50 fucking years!

1361
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:46,400
You and the people you work for
are destroying the most respected,

1362
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:49,200
the highest rated, the most
profitable show on this network.

1363
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:07,900
Here. These are
their leads, their sources.

1364
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:11,000
- I want you to have your reporters...
- Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

1365
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,200
Have them make
their own calls.

1366
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:18,000
They'll find that these sources
have a different story than
the one that's in the dossier.

1367
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:20,900
Push the deadline,
Charlie.

1368
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:30,100
I'll push it for a week.
I want Milo and Suein to go through it.

1369
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:45,700
What do you want
to buy him for a gift?

1370
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:49,500
<i>Mmm, he's into</i>
<i>kind of little cars that, um...</i>

1371
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:51,600
- That remote control thing?
- Yeah.

1372
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,900
All right.
We'll go do that tomorrow.

The most recent trouble
for Wigand occurred here...

1377
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,100
And in local news,
WLKO, Louisville,

1378
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:10,700
has gained access
to a 500-page dossier...

1379
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:13,500
<i>on former Brown & Williamson</i>
<i>research head, Jeffrey Wigand,</i>

<i>and failing to pay child support.</i>

1381
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:19,200
Wigand is currently teaching
chemistry and Japanese...

1382

<i>at the</i>
<i>DuPont Manual High School.</i>

<i> Thousands of documents</i>

<i>have surfaced</i>
<i>over the past year.</i>

U.S. Surgeon general...

1388
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:56,000
and the current head of the Food and
Drug Administration have been saying.

1389
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:58,500
We learned of a tobacco insider
who could tell us...

1390
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:02,500
<i>whether or not the tobacco industry</i>
<i>has been leveling with the public.</i>

1391
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:04,300
<i>That insider was formerly...</i>

1392
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:07,200
<i>a highly-placed executive</i>
<i>with a tobacco company.</i>

1393
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:11,000
<i>But we cannot broadcast what critical</i>
<i>information about tobacco,</i>

1394
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:14,200
<i>addiction and public health</i>
<i>he might be able to offer.</i>

1395
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:17,900
<i>Why? Because he had to sign</i>
<i>a confidentiality agreement...</i>

1396
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:20,300
<i>with the tobacco company</i>
<i>he worked for.</i>

1397
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:23,400
<i>The management of CBS</i>
<i>has told us...</i>

1398
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:25,400
<i>that knowing</i>
<i>he had that agreement...</i>

1399
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:27,800
<i>if we were to broadcast</i>
<i>an interview with him,</i>

1400
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:31,700
<i>CBS could be faced with</i>
<i>a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.</i>

1401
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:35,400
<i>The fact is, we are not allowed</i>
<i>even to mention his name...</i>

1402
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:38,000
or the name of the company
he worked for.

1403
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:42,300
And, of course, we cannot
show you his face.

1404
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:45,200
And your confidentiality
agreement with...

- Is still in force?
- Yes, it is.

<i>Sue you for making this appearance?</i>

1413
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:28,500
All right.
What did you think?

1414
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,700
I think it was
a disgrace.

1415
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:58,000
- Still no answer.
- Get me the manager's office.

1416
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,200
David. David, you've got
a call on line four.

I think you
better take it.

1418

This is David McDougal.
How can I help you?

1419
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:10,000
Mr. McDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.
I'm a producer for <i>60 Minutes.</i>

Mr. Wigand?

1422
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:25,500
Mr. Wigand?

1423
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:34,000
I-I think I need to call the police.
He won't respond.

1424
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,700
No, no, don't call the police. Just
tell him I'm on the phone with you.

1425
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:39,100
My name is Lowell Bergman.
Just tell him that.

1426
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,600
Mr. Wigand, Mr. Bergman
is on the telephone.

1427
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:46,000
Did he hear you?

1428
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:48,200
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

1429
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:50,800
What about now?

1430
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:53,300
- What?
- Hello? Can you hear me now?

1431
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:02,100
- What's happening?
- He doesn't seem to be listening.

1432
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,900
All right. Now listen to me.
I want you... I want you to tell him...

1433
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:08,200
in these words:
Get on the fucking phone.

1434
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,400
I-I can't say that.

1435
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,900
No, you can. Tell him
to get on the fucking phone!

1436
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:16,000
He told me to tell you
to get on the... fucking phone!

1437
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:24,600
You manipulated me into this.

1438
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,700
- That's bullshit, Jeff.
- You greased the rails.

1439
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:30,800
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted
to say "yes." I helped him to say "yes."

1440
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:33,400
That's all.
You're not a robot, Jeff.

1441
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:36,300
- All right? You got a mind
of your own, don't you?
- " Up to you, Jeffrey.

1442
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,400
"That's the power you have,
Jeffrey.

1443
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,900
Vital inside information
the American public need to know."

1444
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,300
Lowell Bergman... the hotshot who never
met a source he couldn't turn around.

1445
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:46,500
I fought for you,
and I still fight for you!

1446
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:49,100
You fought for me?
You manipulated me...

1447
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:52,100
into where I am now... staring
at the Brown & Williamson building!

1448
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:55,300
It's all dark except the tenth floor.
That's the legal department.

1449
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:59,000
That's where they
fuck with my life.

1450
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,800
Jeffrey, where you going
with this?

1451
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:08,100
So, where you going?

1452
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,800
You are... important...

1453
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:17,700
to a lot of people,
Jeffrey.

1454
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:19,700
You think about that.

1455
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:22,500
You think about them.

1456
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,400
I'm running out
of heroes, man.

1457

1458
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:48,200
Yeah, guys like you too.

1459
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,900
Where are you, anyway?

1460
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:59,400
I'm on a leave of absence.
Forced vacation.

1461
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:04,400

1462
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,700
Yeah, I will.

1463
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:23,200

You know, you take the <i>60 Minutes...</i>

1464
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,700
out of that sentence,
nobody returns your phone calls.

<i>Maybe I'm hooked.</i>

1467
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:35,900
The rush of <i>60 Minutes?</i>

02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:41,900
It's so fucking useless,
all of it.

1470
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:45,600
So it's a big country with a free press.
You can go and work somewhere else.

1471
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:47,600
"Free press"?
The press is free.

1472
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:51,200
For anyone who owns one.
Larry Tisch has a free press.

1473
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:53,400
- Get some perspective, Lowell.
- I got perspective.

1474
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,300
No, you do not.

1475
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:59,100
From my perspective,

1476
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:03,000
what's been going on and what
I've been doing is ridiculous.

1477
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:05,300
- It's half-measures.
<i>- You're not listening.</i>

1478
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:14,300
Really know what you're
going to do before you do it.

1479
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:56,200
<i>I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone.</i>

1480
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:59,100
Patch him through.

1481
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:01,900
Well, Lowell, you are
not gonna believe this.

1482
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:06,100
The governor of Mississippi
is suing his own attorney general...

1483
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,600
to abandon litigation
against Big Tobacco.

1484
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:13,400
- Oh, good.
- But now that the version
without Jeff ran,

1485
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:16,700
what's the chance of getting
his interview on the air?

1486
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,900
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1487
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:23,300
What chance is there of getting
Jeff's interview on the air?

1488
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:25,200
Less than great.

1489
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:32,000
I'd be lying to you
if I did not tell you...

1490
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:35,300
how important it was
in the court of public opinion.

1491
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,900
I'd be lying to you
if I didn't tell you...

1492
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:41,600
I'm about out of moves,
Dick.

1493
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,600
All right.
See ya.

1494
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:09,400
Hi.

1495
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:15,300
So, what are you folks
doing... here in Lincoln?

1496
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:20,200
- Geology survey.
- Geology?

1497
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,100
Yeah?
Really?

1498
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
How about you?

1499
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:28,800
I work for CBS News.

1500
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:31,300
Oh, yeah?

1501
02:09:57,400 --> 02:09:59,900
Just ran into
two of your geologists.

1502
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:02,400
Geologists whose hands
aren't all chewed up.

1503
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:06,400
Lowell, do not...
screw this up.

1504
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:08,700
We are a week away
from an arrest.

1505
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:13,000
- So I'll hold it. And?
- We'll give you a heads-up
before we launch.

1506
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,500
- How long?
- Three hours.

1507
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:17,400
<i>You got a deal.</i>

1508
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,600
<i>... like the testimony before Congress</i>
<i>of Dr. Wigand's former boss,</i>

1509
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:39,300
<i>Brown & Williamson's chief</i>
<i>executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.</i>

1510
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:41,400
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

1511
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:44,000
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

1512
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:47,500
- because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.
- All of us did.

1513
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,700
There was this
whole line of people,

1514
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:52,200
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

1515
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:55,300
Part of the reason I'm here
is that I felt...

1516
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:57,400
that their representation...

1517
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:27,500
...can be more rapidly absorbed
in the lung...

1518
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:29,600
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

1519
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:55,100
- Hello?
- Jim, it's Lowell.

1520
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:58,800
- Hey, where are you?
- Remember that night at P.J.'s?

1521
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,300
You asked me if we were
sitting on something explosive.
Well, we're not sitting on it.

1522
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:05,900
CBS Corporate leaned on CBS News,
which yanked an interview we did...

1523
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:09,700
with a top-ranking tobacco scientist,
corporate officer.

1524
02:12:09,700 --> 02:12:11,800
They're trying to
close down the story.

1525
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:15,000
You mean, <i>60 Minutes</i>
is letting CBS Corporate...

1526
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,400
decide what is
or is not news?

1527
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:20,000
What's Wallace think
about this? Or Hewitt, or...

1528
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:22,100
How prominent?
What kind of placement?

1529
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,500
Oh, come on, Lowell. This is
<i>The New York Times.</i> I don't know.

1530
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:29,600
Well, until you do, all I can
tell you is what you already know.

1531
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,400
They will not
air an interview.

1532
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:33,900
Call me back in ten.

1533
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:43,500
- Hello?
- Debbie, it's me.

1534
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:45,900
Hi.
What time is it?

1535
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:49,900
- Oh, it's late.
- That I know. When are you coming back?

1536
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:52,700
I can't get out of here till
mid-morning. I'll be in tomorrow night.

1537
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:56,300
Listen, could you call a number
for me? It's in Mississippi.

1538
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:58,100
Okay.
Hold on a second.

1539
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:02,300
What is it?

1540
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:09,800
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1541
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:13,800
All right, Lowell. Page one.
Editorial's interested. Let's talk.

1542
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:18,200
Here's how it works. You ask me
questions. I tell you if you're wrong.

1543
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:22,300
- Lowell, you sure you want to do this?
- Why?

1544
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:25,700
Hey, it doesn't work,
you've burned your bridges, man.

1545
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:27,800
You ready?

1546
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:30,400
Okay.
About this whistle-blower,

1547
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:33,000
did Mike and Don go along
with the corporate decision?

1548
02:13:34,900 --> 02:13:39,700
- Lowell?
- Did I tell you you were wrong?

1549
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:43,600
No. Um, I'm assuming
the cave-in begins...

1550
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:46,000
with the threat of litigation
from Big Tobacco.

1551
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:48,400
Are we talking, uh...

1552
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:51,300
Are we talking
Brown & Williamson here?

1553
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:24,700
Did I get you up?

1554
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:28,700
No, I usually sit around
my hotel room dressed like this
at 5:30 in the morning,

1555
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:30,600
sleepy look on my face.

1556
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:34,400
How many shows have
we done? Huh?

1557
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,500
- Come on. How many?
- Oh, lots.

1558
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:38,400
That's right.

1559
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:42,700
But in all that time,
Mike,

1560
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:45,500
did you ever get off a plane,
walk into a room...

1561
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:50,500
and find that a source
for a story changed his mind?

1562
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,700
Lost his heart?
Walked out on us?

1563
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:55,400
Not one fucking time.
You wanna know why?

1564
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,900
I see a rhetorical question
on the horizon.

1565
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:59,800
I'm gonna tell you why.

1566
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:03,200
Because when I tell someone
I'm gonna do something, I deliver.

1567
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:07,300
Oh, how fortunate I am to have
Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage...

1568
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:09,900
- to point me down the shining
path, to show me the way.
- Oh, please, Mike.

1569
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:12,200
- Give me a break.
- You give me a break.

1570
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:15,300
I never left a source
hung out to dry <i>ever.</i>

1571
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:18,100
Abandoned.
Not till right fucking now.

1572
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,700
When I came on this job,
I came with my word intact.

1573
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:25,700
I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
Fuck the rules of the game!

1574
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:27,500
Hell, you're supposed
to know me, Mike.

1575
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:29,600
What the hell
did you expect?

1576
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:32,300
You expect me to lie down?

1577
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:35,200
Back off?
Or get over it?

1578
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:39,300
In the real world, when you get to where
I am, there are other considerations.

1579
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:42,400
Like what?
Corporate responsibility?

1580
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:44,600
- What, are we talking celebrity here?
- I'm not...

1581
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:48,500
I'm not talking about
celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm...

1582
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:50,300
I'm...
I'm talking about...

1583
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:54,500
when you're nearer the end
of your life than the beginning.

1584
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:58,200
And what do you think
you think about then? The future?

1585
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,700
"In the future, I'm gonna
do this, become that"?

1586
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:02,900
What future? No.

1587
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:05,700
What you think is...

1588
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:08,200
"How will I be regarded
in the end...

1589
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:11,800
after I'm gone?"

1590
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:15,700
Oh, along the way, I suppose
I made some minor impact.

1591
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:19,700
I did Irangate,
the Ayatollah, Malcolm X,

1592
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:22,300
Martin Luther King,
Saddam, Sadat, etc., etc.

1593
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:27,000
I showed them thieves in suits.
I spent a lifetime building...

1594
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:28,800
all that.

1595
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:35,600
But history only remembers most
what you did last.

1596
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:38,500
And should that be
fronting a segment...

1597
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:42,300
that allowed a tobacco giant
to crash this network...

1598
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:50,600
Does it give someone...

1599
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:55,900
at my time of life pause?

1600
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:57,700
Yeah.

1601
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:06,200
Mike,

1602
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:09,800
in my...

1603
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:14,900
You and I
have been doing this...

1604
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:18,700
together for 14 years.

1605
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,000
This is today's
<i>New York Times.</i>

1606
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:25,100
In it is the whole
sordid story...

1607
02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:28,700
of what went on
inside our shop.

1608
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:33,200
And in the editorial,
it accuses us...

1609
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:36,000
of betraying the legacy
of Edward R. Murrow.

1610
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:02,800
They conclude most of it
seems pretty unsubstantiated.

1611
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:13,400
You're full of shit,
John.

1612
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:25,500
Yeah.

1613
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:28,200
<i>Front page. There's a picture of Wigand.</i>

1614
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:30,100
<i>Article's entitled,</i>
<i>"Getting Personal."</i>

1615
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:32,100
Byline to Suein Hwang
and Milo Geyelin.

1616
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:34,600
Wait. Hold on
a second, Lowell.

1617
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:36,400
Yeah.

1618
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:43,300
Yeah, I'll see
if I can find him.

1619
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:46,400
Yeah, hold on.
Don's looking for you.

1620
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:49,700
- Good.
- The subheading
is " Brown & Williamson...

1621
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:52,800
has a 500-page dossier
attacking chief critic."

1622
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:55,200
It quotes Richard Scruggs
calling it the worst kind...

1623
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:58,400
of an organized smear campaign
against a whistle-blower.

1624
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:01,800
"A close look at the file
and independent research
by this newspaper...

1625
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:05,100
"into its key claim indicates
that many of the serious allegations...

1626
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:10,400
against Mr. Wigand are backed by
scant or contradictory evidence."

1627
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:31,400
<i>This news division has been vilified...</i>

1628
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:34,200
in <i>The New York Times,</i>
in print, on television...

1629
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:36,100
for caving
to corporate interests!

1630
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:40,000
<i>The New York Times</i> ran a
blow-by-blow of what we talked
about behind closed doors.

1631
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,700
- You fucked us!
- No! You fucked you!

1632
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:44,700
Don't invert stuff.

1633
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:47,500
Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand.
You bought it.

1634
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:50,300
The <i>Wall Street Journal...</i>
here... not exactly...

1635
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:53,000
a bastion of
anti-capitalist sentiment,

1636
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:55,500
refutes Big Tobacco's
smear campaign...

1637
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:58,900
as the lowest form
of character assassination.

1638
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:00,800
And now, even now,
when every word...

1639
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:03,800
of what Wigand has said
on our show is printed,

1640
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:07,400
the entire deposition
of his testimony in a court of law...

1641
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:09,400
in the state of Mississippi,
the cat...

1642
02:20:09,400 --> 02:20:12,100
<i>totally</i> out of the bag,

1643
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:14,100
you're still
standing here debating.

1644
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:18,500
<i>Don, what the hell else</i>
<i>do you need?</i>

1645
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:20,700
Mike, you tell him.

1646
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:22,700
You fucked up, Don.

1647
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:32,600
It's old news. Stick with me,
like always. We'll be okay.

1648
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:35,700
These things have
a half-life of 15 minutes.

1649
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:39,600
No, that's fame.
Fame has a 15-minute half-life.

1650
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:41,500
Infamy lasts
a little longer.

1651
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:46,700
<i>We caved. It's foolish.</i>
<i>It's simply dead wrong.</i>

1652
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:50,400
Now this is what we're going to do.
We're going over to Black Rock...

1653
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:58,300
Okay? So let's get back to work.
Now what we saw there...

1654
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:00,800
<i>was two potassium chlorate...</i>

1655
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:05,900
would yield two potassium
chloride, also a solid...

1656
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:19,700
They cancelled the 6:00.
I don't know why. I...

1657
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:23,300
I'm on the 8:10.
I should be home... 9:30.

1658
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:25,800
I'll see you then.
I love you. Bye.

1659
02:21:39,300 --> 02:21:41,300
- Oh. Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks.

1660
02:21:53,300 --> 02:21:55,300
CBS management wouldn't
let us broadcast...

1661
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:58,800
our original story and our
interview with Jeffrey Wigand...

1662
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:01,000
because they were worried
about the possibility...

1663
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,900
of a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit against us...

1664
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:06,200
<i>for tortious interference.</i>

1665
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:08,300
<i>But now things have changed.</i>

1666
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:11,100
<i>What Dr. Wigand told us</i>
<i>was that his former...</i>

1667
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,900
<i> This industry,</i>
<i>in my opinion, is an industry...</i>

1668
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:45,900
that has perpetrated the biggest fraud
on the American public in history.

1669
02:22:45,700 --> 02:22:47,900
They've killed millions
and millions of...

1670
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,200
<i>You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?</i>

1671
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:17,500
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

1672
02:23:17,400 --> 02:23:22,600
There are times I feel com...
compelled to do it.

1673
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:24,400
If you ask me...

1674
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:27,300
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

1675
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,900
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

1676
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:41,000
I promised you a three-hour
heads up. Here it is.

1677
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:44,400
Have a camera crew standing by
in Helena, Montana on Tuesday,

1678
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:46,200
and I'll give you
a three-hour head start.

1679
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:49,600
All right? By the way, that was
a hell of a good show tonight.

1680
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:51,500
- Thank you, Bill.
- Yeah.

1681
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,200
You won.

1682
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:15,100
Yeah.

1683
02:24:18,300 --> 02:24:20,200
What did I win?

1684
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:28,100
<i> Reporting</i>

Thanks for this.

1691

You know, we beat everybody.
ABC, NBC, CNN.

1692

Mike.

1693
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:11,100
That Canada story...

still interest you?

1695

Everything interests me.

Uh, I quit, Mike.

1697
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:23,000
Bullshit.

Come on.

1699
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:29,600
It all worked out.

1700
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:32,400
You came out okay
in the end.

1701
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:34,300
I did?

1702
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:37,500
What do I tell a source
on the next tough story?

1703
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:40,400
"Hang in with us.
You'll be fine. Maybe."

1704
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:43,200
No.

1705
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:46,200
What got broken here...

1706
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,500
doesn't go
back together again.

1707
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,400
So, uh...
