1
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:04,881
I've got four Lamborghinis
that can't meet smog emission standards.

2
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,079
How many times
you wash out with E.P.A.?

3
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:10,453
Sir, they're
clearing E.P.A. in a few days.

4
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,924
Three times?
You're on a roll.

5
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,553
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for twelve.

6
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,189
Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

7
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,529
I told you I've never
dealt with Lamborghinis...

8
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,764
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver the cars within that time frame.

9
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,350
Don't tell me that,
'cause I'm not even listening.

10
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,442
Sir, I hardly think
that's necessary.

11
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,953
I'll explain that
to my swing loan.

12
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:33,923
I'm into him for 200,000.
That's thousand, three zeros.

13
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:37,791
I got my money tied up in these cars.
If I don't get it, I am finished.

14
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:41,263
- Do you understand that?
- You have to understand our situation.

15
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:43,960
I got a shark snappin' at my heels.

16
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:46,526
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.

17
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:49,038
I am holding them off
with a whip and a chair.

18
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:51,574
I understand that.
I know delivery is way overdue.

19
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:54,770
This fuckin' E.P.A.!
The whole world is chokin' on smog...

20
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:58,680
and they're gonna correct the situation
by keeping my four cars off the road?

21
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:01,115
Babbitt Collectibles.

22
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:03,983
Have you tried cash?
How much do these E.P.A. guys earn?

23
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:06,023
Charlie, Mr. Wyatt.

24
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,251
- Wyatt?
- Yeah, about the swing Loan.

25
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:11,853
If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna come and seize all the cars.

26
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:15,262
- I have to call you back.
- You should talk to Mr. Babbitt.

27
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:20,168
Tell him you watched me sign the check
on Tuesday, then you put it in the mail.

28
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,365
I need this.
Come on.

29
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,375
I wouldn't do that until
you talk to Mr. Babbitt.

30
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:27,877
His number?
He's on the road now.

31
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:30,175
- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie--

32
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:32,978
Tell him I'm connecting to Barbados,
arriving 1:30 a.m.

33
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,518
- Charlie!
- Lenny, I'm standing right here.

34
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:38,578
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

35
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:42,456
They want their down payments back.
They found two cars at Valley Motors.

36
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:45,655
Tell him that that was me on the line,
the cars just passed emissions...

37
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,789
and the E.P.A. paperwork
will be in here momentarily.

38
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:50,857
- You payin' attention to me?
- Yeah, I'm Listening.

39
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:54,496
Tell them also that I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deals.

40
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:57,939
- Do you understand that, Lenny?
- I got it.

41
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:02,436
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other Line.

42
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:05,880
As it happens,
the cars are passing emissions--

43
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,475
What am I saying?
The cars have passed emissions.

44
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:12,080
We're waiting for the E.P.A. paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.

45
00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:15,091
And because of your
incredible patience...

46
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:19,721
we're going to knock off $5,000
on each car.

47
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:22,391
Well, yes,
you've been most patient.

48
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:26,402
We really appreciate your patience.
Well, thank you.

49
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,461
Thank you.

50
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:32,342
Ready for Palm Springs?

51
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,605
You still want to go
with all these problems?

52
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:37,739
We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.

53
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:40,784
- Not bad for a couple of phone calls.
- No, not bad at all.

54
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:43,786
- You know where to find us, right?
- Right.

55
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:45,788
I got it under control.

56
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:11,079
I don't want to be demanding...

57
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:16,017
but could you possibly say 10 or
12 words before we get to the hotel?

58
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:18,612
Consider it foreplay.

59
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:22,056
Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?

60
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:26,227
I'm just thinkin'.
Nothing special.

61
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:30,165
Maybe there's something that
you're thinking about that we can talk.

62
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:33,032
If there was, Susanna,
we'd be talkin' about it.

63
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:35,368
What's the big to-do
about me thinkin'?

64
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,342
I just feel like I'm going away for
a few days with someone. Call me crazy.

65
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:43,676
You wanna talk? Let's talk.
How was your day?

66
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:48,344
I feel you're excluding me from what's
going on. It's not that I wanna talk.

67
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,650
One of these again, Susanna.
How did we get back to one of these?

68
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:54,987
I don't want to-- I don't know
why I put up with all of this.

69
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:58,051
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're goin'.

70
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,223
But I didn't wanna go alone.
I've been sitting in this car for--

71
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:04,096
You wanna talk?
Let's talk!

72
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:07,467
This is not talking.

73
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:10,473
- Yeah?
- Charlie, this is Lenny.

74
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,237
I've been trying to contact you
for a while.

75
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,007
I got a long-distance call from
Mr. Mooney, your father's lawyer.

76
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:19,811
He's been trying to reach you.

77
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:22,375
Your father has died, Charlie.

78
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:28,789
I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow
in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.

79
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:31,851
- I've got his number.
- That's not necessary.

80
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:33,988
Anything else?

81
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:37,262
- If there's anything I can do--
- All right.

82
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:43,672
- I'm sorry about the weekend, hon.
- Charlie, the weekend?

83
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:47,575
I told you before,
we had a falling-out a Long time ago.

84
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:50,705
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

85
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:54,046
We just didn't get along.

86
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:56,484
- You're going to the funeral, no?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:56,554 --> 00:08:01,218
- I'm coming with you.
- That's sweet, but there's no point.

88
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,850
I want to.

89
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:06,658
All right. Sorry.
I forgot who I was talkin' to.

90
00:08:23,147 --> 00:08:24,341
...to our beloved neighbor...

91
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:29,216
for our memory, admiration
and respect for him...

92
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:32,744
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.

93
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:37,624
Let us consecrate ourselves to follow
his example of zest for Life...

94
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:40,163
dedication to family...

95
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:43,325
and charity to all.

96
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,200
And now, with sure and certain hope
of resurrection Life...

97
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:51,640
we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend.

98
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:05,377
Just have to go over the details of
the will with him, and then we leave.

99
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,117
I can wait in the car.

100
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:47,666
Somebody should be watering those roses.
They're all dying.

101
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:51,672
Knew this car my whole Life.
Only drove it once.

102
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,177
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.
Only 8,000 production models made.

103
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:58,713
Straight-Eight.
Fireball Eight.

104
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:03,218
It was the first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.

105
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,753
Know it by rote.

106
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,271
You were his only child.

107
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,773
You came along when he was...

108
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:28,503
what, 45 or something?

109
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,375
He probably thought
he was never going to have a son...

110
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:33,745
so he had to love you.

111
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:37,718
I think you're exaggerating.
You were his child, his son, his blood.

112
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:41,654
In these pictures here, he doesn't look
Like a man who doesn't love his son.

113
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,057
What are you doin' lookin' at this?
Put that away.

114
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:47,220
- You want to hear a story?
- Don't get mad.

115
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:50,959
You know the convertible in the garage?
His baby, that and the goddamn roses.

116
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:54,161
- The Buick.
- The car was off-limits to me.

117
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,330
'That's a classic,' he'd say.
'It's not for children.'

118
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,704
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old,
and for once...

119
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,471
I bring home a report card,
and it's almost all A's.

120
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:05,138
I go to my old man,
'Can I take the car out?'

121
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:08,706
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

122
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:12,743
He says, 'No.'
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.

123
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:16,723
You took the car with no permission?
Why? Why then?

124
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,488
Because l--
I deserved it.

125
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,928
Nothing I did was good enough for
this guy. Don't you understand that?

126
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:25,762
We're on Columbia Parkway,
four kids.

127
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,268
- We get pulled over.
- An accident?

128
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:30,771
Pulled over.

129
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,570
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.

130
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:38,135
Can I finish?
He called in a report of a stolen car.

131
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:42,274
Not 'his son took the car
without permission.' Just 'stolen.'

132
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:44,945
Central Station. The other guys' dads
bail 'em out in an hour.

133
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,046
- He left me there two days.
- He left you in prison two days?

134
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,557
Two days.

135
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,459
Were you scared?

136
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,997
Yeah, I was scared.

137
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,100
Left home.
I never saw him again.

138
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:01,864
Charlie, after a year
we've been together...

139
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:04,371
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

140
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,135
It's strange, huh?

141
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:10,144
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?

142
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:15,047
When I was a kid and I got scared,
the Rain Man would come and sing to me.

143
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:18,517
The rain what?

144
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:22,250
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.

145
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,760
- What happened to him?
- Nothin'. I just grew up.

146
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,889
Not so much.

147
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,933
'And I remember, too,
the day you left home...

148
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,869
so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas.

149
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,997
So full of yourself.

150
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:40,541
And being raised without a mother,
the hardness of your heart...

151
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,736
is understandable as well.

152
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:46,770
Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me...

153
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,476
all these I forgive.

154
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,781
But your failure to write, to telephone,
to reenter my Life in any way...

155
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,584
has left me without a son.

156
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:58,615
I wish you all I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best.'

157
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,699
'l hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt...

158
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,704
that certain Buick convertible...

159
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:14,607
the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.

160
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:18,806
Also, outright title to my
prizewinning hybrid rose bushes.

161
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,815
May they remind him
of the value of excellence...

162
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,317
and the possibility of perfection.

163
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,218
As for my home and all other property,
real and personal...

164
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:29,451
these shall be placed in trust
in accordance with the terms of...

165
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:32,688
that certain instrument
executed concurrently herewith.'

166
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,456
What does that mean?

167
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,125
It means that the estate,
in excess of $3 million...

168
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,864
after expenses and taxes,
will go into a trust fund...

169
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:45,498
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.

170
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,543
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

171
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,011
- Who controls the money? You?
- No. He's called a trustee.

172
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,244
What is that?
How does that work?

173
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:58,184
Forgive me,
but there's nothing more I can say.

174
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:01,154
I'm sorry, son.
I can see that you're disappointed.

175
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:04,158
Why should I be disappointed?
I got rose bushes, didn't l?

176
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:06,387
What's his name got--

177
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:08,487
- What'd you call him? The--
- Beneficiary.

178
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:11,431
He got $3 million,
but he didn't get the rose bushes.

179
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,491
I definitely got
the rose bushes.

180
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:16,265
- Charles.
- I mean, those are rose bushes.

181
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:19,136
- There's no need--
- To what?

182
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,403
To be upset?

183
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:23,843
To be upset?

184
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:26,574
If there is a hell, sir,
my father's in it...

185
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:30,914
and he is looking up right now
and he is laughing his ass off.

186
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,750
Sanford Babbitt. You wanna be
that guy's son for five minutes?

187
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:37,189
- Were you Listening to that letter?
- Yes, sir, I was.

188
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,523
Were you?

189
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:43,622
No. Could you repeat it?
'Cause I can't believe my fuckin' ears.

190
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,097
I was looking for you.

191
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:52,106
How did it go?

192
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,642
I got what I expected.

193
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:13,387
Susanna, this could take
a few minutes.

194
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:33,309
- Can I help you?
- I think you can.

195
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:37,819
I have a problem with a private trust
and-- That's a terrific suit.

196
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:40,081
- Thank you.
- My father was Sanford Babbitt.

197
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,266
Is this Wallbrook?

198
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:54,268
Excuse me.
Is this Wallbrook?

199
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,429
Excuse me.

200
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,440
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.

201
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:07,448
Would you Like
to wait in his office?

202
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,950
No, we'll stay here.
Thank you.

203
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,300
Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around here.

204
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:47,285
Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.

205
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,984
Twenty dollars starts you all
on an important match.

206
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:54,927
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn
get away from it all? Lisa?

207
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,261
- 'Private Benjamin.'
- Excuse me, please.

208
00:16:57,332 --> 00:16:59,823
I'd Like to watch
the TV, please.

209
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:03,894
For whose grandson was the
presidential retreat Camp David named?

210
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:05,735
- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.

211
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:08,207
Right, for David Eisenhower.
You've got another five.

212
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,211
Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.

213
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,942
In days of yore, what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?

214
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:43,074
Whatever this is, I don't understand
the point of secrecy.

215
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,579
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?

216
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,081
I knew your father
since you were two years old.

217
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,811
The year my mother died.

218
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:53,116
I'm trustee of the fund, but this
hospital receives nothing from that.

219
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,782
Maybe that's something
we could discuss.

220
00:17:55,857 --> 00:18:00,123
I took on this burden out of loyalty
to your father. My loyalty ends there.

221
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:02,288
And you think
I should feel that loyalty?

222
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,595
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright...

223
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,158
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

224
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:11,501
And I think if I were in your shoes,
I'd probably feel the same.

225
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:14,440
I was hoping that we could talk, that
you would explain my father's side...

226
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,443
help me understand
the right in what he's done.

227
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:19,605
Because, failing that,
I have responsibilities of my own...

228
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,445
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

229
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:25,019
I'm sorry,
this is not your car.

230
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:27,578
Yeah, my dad lets me
drive slow on the driveway.

231
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:30,557
- I'm an excellent driver.
- Are you sure that you drive this car?

232
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,561
There's only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.

233
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:38,087
- Should be more than 28 miles.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.

234
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,758
Of course, today's Monday.

235
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:42,770
I always drive the car on Saturday.
Never drive on a Monday.

236
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:45,466
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.

237
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,974
- Well, he can jump out.
- I'm an excellent driver.

238
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,877
Yeah, that's good. Come on.
I don't have time for this shit.

239
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,643
Why'd you let him get in?
This is not a toy.

240
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:58,174
- He says he drives this car.
- Dad lets me drive every Saturday.

241
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,551
Of course, the seats were
originally brown leather.

242
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:03,090
Now they're pitiful red.

243
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,592
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

244
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:09,389
- You know this car?
- I know this car.

245
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,426
- How do you know this car?
- I definitely know this car.

246
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:17,666
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.

247
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,207
Only 8,095 production models.

248
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,800
Dad lets me drive on the driveway,
but not on Monday.

249
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:24,812
- Definitely not on Monday.
- Who's your dad?

250
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,314
- Sanford Babbitt.
- Who? Sanford Babbitt?

251
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:30,977
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

252
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:34,146
That's my address.
What is it with this guy? Hey!

253
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:36,213
- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.

254
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,749
- Eleanor?
- Died January 5th, 1965.

255
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:43,491
Who the hell are you?
Wait a second. Where are you goin'?

256
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:46,125
Thirteen minutes to Judge Wapner
and 'The People's Court.'

257
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,260
I wanna ask you a question.

258
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:50,942
What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not actors--

259
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,876
- I'm talkin' to you!
- They're actual litigants.

260
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:56,175
Bruner, who is this guy?

261
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:58,512
Raymond is your brother.

262
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:03,418
My brother?
I don't have a brother.

263
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:06,150
...and have your disputes
settled here in our forum:

264
00:20:06,224 --> 00:20:09,125
'The People's Court.'

265
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:11,685
'The People's Court.'

266
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,898
'The People's Court.'

267
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:23,204
Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,
and welcome to 'The People's Court.'

268
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:25,209
- What is he, crazy?
- No.

269
00:20:25,277 --> 00:20:26,744
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

270
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:30,043
- Not crazy or retarded, but he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.

271
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:32,049
I don't know what that means.

272
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,608
People Like him used to
be called 'idiot savants.'

273
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:37,553
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.

274
00:20:37,622 --> 00:20:39,817
- Well, he's retarded.
- Autistic.

275
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:43,418
- Actually, high-functioning.
- What does that mean?

276
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:46,726
It means that there's a disability
that impairs the sensory input...

277
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:48,789
and how it's processed.

278
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:51,301
English here.
You're talkin' over my head.

279
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:53,667
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

280
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:56,673
He can't even express himself
or probably even...

281
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:59,005
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

282
00:21:01,313 --> 00:21:05,909
And after that, the dog bit him.
I yelled at my dog.

283
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:08,509
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

284
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:11,522
Routines, rituals--
It's all he has to protect himself.

285
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,990
Rituals. That's a good one.

286
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,823
Well, it's the way he acts...

287
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:20,831
sleeps, eats, uses the bathroom,
walks, talks, everything.

288
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,892
- Breaking a routine is terrifying.
- How Long has he been here?

289
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,337
- I came here in 1960.
- How old is he?

290
00:21:28,406 --> 00:21:31,000
He was 18 or 20 then.
I have to check the records.

291
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:33,772
- You've been here that Long?
- That's when I started.

292
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:37,576
So that's '65, '75, '85--
I was almost three years old.

293
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:40,641
You knew he had a brother.
You knew I was his brother.

294
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:44,553
- Yes, but what's the point?
- What's the fuckin' point?

295
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:48,024
- Why wasn't I told I had a brother?
- What would you have done about it?

296
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:52,255
I don't know.

297
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,593
Does he know how much money
he's been left?

298
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:58,829
No. He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

299
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:03,668
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

300
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:06,006
He's just inherited $3 million...

301
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:08,910
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

302
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,246
Well, that is fuckin' poetic,
don't you think?

303
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:17,446
Good ol' Dad.

304
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:20,558
What's his name? Yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.

305
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,856
Who? The fellow playing
first base for St. Louie. Who?

306
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:25,920
Why is he doin' that?

307
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:29,023
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does 'Who's On First?'

308
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,034
- Yeah, why?
- Why?

309
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:33,935
It's his way of dealing with you
touching his books and stuff.

310
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:38,499
- So he memorized 'Who's On First?'
- That, among other things.

311
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:41,011
- Ted Kloszevski.
- Kluszewski.

312
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,707
Ted Kluszewski. 'Big Klu.'
First base.

313
00:22:43,782 --> 00:22:46,376
- He played for Cincinnati.
- Traded for Dee Fondee, 1957.

314
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:50,547
- Lifetime batting average, .298.
- He reads all these great books, huh?

315
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:53,523
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.

316
00:22:55,894 --> 00:22:59,921
Vern. V-E-R-N. Of course, these people
are gonna be here all day, Vern.

317
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:02,398
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

318
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:06,233
-This is definitely not a weekend visit.
-He's gettin' anxious.

319
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:09,467
- It's okay, Ray.
- Vern.

320
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,374
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

321
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:15,072
- He said not to touch the books!
- Not to touch books.

322
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:17,341
- You Like Shakespeare?
- I don't know.

323
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:19,713
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know. Vern?

324
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:22,184
- Did you read 'MacBeth'?
- I don't know.

325
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:24,245
- Vern?
- 'The Twelfth Night'?

326
00:23:24,322 --> 00:23:26,552
- Stop it!
- Yes.

327
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:31,358
You read all the stories in this book,
and you don't know if you read the book?

328
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:33,454
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

329
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:34,657
Maybe you'd better put it back.

330
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:40,698
You don't know.
Okay, Ray, take it easy.

331
00:23:40,772 --> 00:23:43,036
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

332
00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:46,202
It's okay, Ray.
Come on. My main man.

333
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:49,577
Vern, my main man.
My main man Vern.

334
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:52,048
It's okay, Ray.

335
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:54,108
- My main man.
- My main man.

336
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:59,316
Here are your cards. I didn't know
where you wanted me to put them.

337
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:03,225
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

338
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,264
That's his way of showing he likes you.

339
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,166
But when I touched him before,
he pulled away.

340
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:14,399
Don't take it personal.
He never touched me.

341
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm closer to him than anybody.
Known him for nine years. It's not him.

342
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:23,480
If I left town tomorrow and
didn't say good-bye, he'd never notice.

343
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:25,482
He wouldn't notice?

344
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,316
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

345
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:32,220
Ray, you wanna go take a walk?

346
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:39,321
Can he hear us
when he's Like that?

347
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:41,627
You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

348
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,100
There's 27 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

349
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:46,797
Don't worry.
We'll bring you right back.

350
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:49,635
Practically 26 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

351
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:52,677
- We'll bring him right back.
- Twenty-six minutes.

352
00:24:52,744 --> 00:24:55,076
I won't do it.

353
00:24:55,146 --> 00:25:00,049
First of all because of your
tone of voice, this commanding--

354
00:25:00,118 --> 00:25:04,612
You're upset. Raymond,
I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.

355
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:08,455
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.

356
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:11,723
No. Just stay there.

357
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:19,065
Just stay there.
Just stand still, okay? That's good.

358
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:22,971
I'll do it if you tell me why.
Why do I do--

359
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:24,874
What?

360
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:27,673
Why do I have to take the car
and go down there...

361
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:31,079
and wait for you again
at the gate?

362
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:33,481
- Why?
- It's for Raymond.

363
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:35,485
The car disturbs him.

364
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:38,681
- That's why?
- That's why.

365
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:41,057
Okay, Raymond.

366
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:54,501
What are you lookin' at?
The ducks are over here.

367
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:56,335
I don't know.

368
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:02,970
Listen, our father died last week.

369
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:05,038
- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.

370
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:08,813
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

371
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:12,957
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.

372
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:16,391
- You wanna go see him at the cemetery?
- I don't know.

373
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:19,828
- Does that mean maybe you wanna go?
- I don't know.

374
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:27,628
I thought maybe we could go to
Los Angeles and see a Dodgers game.

375
00:26:27,705 --> 00:26:32,039
- Go see the Dodgers play.
- Today's an off day.

376
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,601
- We don't have to go today.
- Monday, no games scheduled.

377
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,082
I just thought maybe you'd Like
to go see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.

378
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,244
He pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch 'til Wednesday.

379
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,754
- He's gonna pitch Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

380
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:47,291
- I'm not doin' anything on Wednesday.
- Yeah, Wednesday.

381
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:50,088
- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.

382
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:52,322
Come on, Ray.

383
00:26:53,531 --> 00:26:55,795
It's a Long way
to California...

384
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:59,598
and I'm definitely not supposed to be
off the grounds for more than two hours.

385
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:02,196
Have to be back in two hours.

386
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:06,073
The people, crowds cheering.
You'll love it.

387
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:49,140
- This is the presidential suite.
- Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.

388
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:50,680
Here is Raymond's room.

389
00:28:50,748 --> 00:28:54,582
- Look at this beautiful room.
- This is definitely not my room.

390
00:28:54,652 --> 00:28:57,587
- It's just for tonight.
- Have to go to Wallbrook for dinner.

391
00:28:57,655 --> 00:29:00,818
Little guy! This is gonna be terrific.
We're brothers.

392
00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:04,919
- Dr. Bruner wants us to have fun.
- When did he say--

393
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:08,762
I don't have my tapioca pudding.
We have that for dessert.

394
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:11,427
We can do that.
I'm gonna call Lenny.

395
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:14,335
This is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding.

396
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:17,636
- The bed's in the wrong place.
- You can move it.

397
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:21,110
- Where do you want the bed?
- Should be near the window.

398
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:25,172
Of course, I don't have my books.
Of course, there's no bookshelves.

399
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:28,275
I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be book-less.

400
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:32,255
Here's a book, a big telephone book.
A lot of words.

401
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:34,291
Pick up, Lenny.

402
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,796
I got $200,000 going to the shithouse,
and he doesn't answer the phone.

403
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:41,661
- 6:00 here means it's 9:00 there.
- It's 3:00 there.

404
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:42,995
6:30 p.m. is dinner.

405
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:46,002
It's 3:00 there.
He doesn't wanna answer the phone?

406
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,004
Orange soda.

407
00:29:49,073 --> 00:29:51,132
Has to be in a can with a straw.

408
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:54,576
Bruner told you
that you should do this?

409
00:29:54,646 --> 00:29:57,080
- It doesn't make sense.
- I know what's good for him.

410
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:19,492
V-E-R-N!

411
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,006
Oh, God.
Go see what he's doin'.

412
00:30:23,908 --> 00:30:26,604
- Ray?
- V-E-R-N!

413
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:28,942
- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?

414
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:32,278
Everything is fine.
Charlie, let's take him home.

415
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,444
He's okay.
Just get him some dinner.

416
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,511
Did you say you wanted hamburger?

417
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:39,647
Hamburger, Ray?

418
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:43,353
- We have pepperoni pizza Monday nights.
- Pizza?

419
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:47,159
- You get pizza in the institution?
- Monday night's Italian night.

420
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:50,598
- Law offices of Mitchell and Mitchell.
- Get me Stu.

421
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:55,071
- I'm sorry, he's not here.
- I've got a bit of a legal problem.

422
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:57,835
He's out of town
until tomorrow afternoon.

423
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:00,275
All right,
I'll call him tomorrow.

424
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:09,318
- Definitely not.
- We can watch TV here. We're allowed.

425
00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:14,756
'Wheel of Fortune'!

426
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:18,785
Look at this studio filled with
glamorous merchandise...

427
00:31:18,863 --> 00:31:21,331
fabulous and exciting
bonus prizes.

428
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:25,836
A pair of cars for today's busy couple.

429
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:28,929
Thousands of dollars in cash.

430
00:31:29,006 --> 00:31:34,410
Over $150,000
just waiting to be won...

431
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:38,006
as we present
our big bonanza of cash...

432
00:31:38,082 --> 00:31:41,916
on 'Wheel Of Fortune'!

433
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:46,355
I'd Like to order a large pizza.
Pepperoni, right?

434
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:47,789
I don't want pepperoni.

435
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:51,955
Yeah, a large pepperoni.
How Long is that gonna take?

436
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:55,863
Bring some beer up and orange soda.
You got tapioca pudding?

437
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:59,198
- No, sir, we don't.
- Just bring the closest thing.

438
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:04,639
Ray, take this.
Food is coming shortly.

439
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,700
I'll be right back.

440
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,976
Of course, I'm gonna be here
for a Long time, a very Long time.

441
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:17,344
I'm gone for good,
gone for good from my home.

442
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:29,175
- Si! Si!
- Si.

443
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,560
What is that?

444
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:53,471
I think Raymond is in the room.

445
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:56,169
- Raymond, are you in here?
- Charlie Babbitt.

446
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:59,508
Well, get out!
Get out!

447
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,514
- Go!
- Stop it.

448
00:34:04,685 --> 00:34:07,620
- Jesus Christ!
- Go in there with him.

449
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:10,156
- Charlie, go in there.
- Why?

450
00:34:10,224 --> 00:34:13,682
He's afraid.
He doesn't understand this.

451
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,695
Go in there.

452
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:23,570
Raymond, what were you doin' in my room?
What were you doin' in my room?

453
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:26,037
- I don't know.
- You don't know what you were doin'?

454
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:29,439
-Of course, there were noises.
-Those noises are none of your business.

455
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,774
You understand that?

456
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:34,336
Stop actin' Like an idiot
and go to sleep.

457
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:36,713
Did you hear what I said?
Go to sleep!

458
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,843
- Go to sleep!
- It's nine minutes to 11:00.

459
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:42,377
- Lights out at 11:00.
- Yeah, well, new rules.

460
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:57,827
You don't listen to me.

461
00:34:57,905 --> 00:35:00,772
- What are you talkin' about?
- I asked you to apologize.

462
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:04,937
- You went there and insulted him again.
- I'm not his mother.

463
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:07,105
Charlie, you're his brother!

464
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:09,649
They tell you today
that you have a brother...

465
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:12,413
and I don't see in your face
one little reaction.

466
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:16,183
- I'm not saying joy.
- You don't know what I'm goin' through.

467
00:35:16,256 --> 00:35:19,248
What are you going through?
Because I don't know.

468
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,419
You don't tell me anything.

469
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:24,259
- You just give me lies!
- What lies?

470
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:28,495
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

471
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:31,766
I know it's not true.
So tell me, why is he here?

472
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,204
- I'm pissed at him.
- At who?

473
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:36,765
- My father.
- So you bring Raymond here. Why?

474
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,938
- 'Cause I got him and they want him!
- This makes no sense!

475
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,380
- Raymond was left all the money.
- How much?

476
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:45,577
- $3 million. Every penny of it.
- So?

477
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:47,780
I'm gonna keep him
'til I get my half!

478
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:54,085
What is this, huh?
Susanna?

479
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:57,662
- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough.

480
00:35:57,731 --> 00:36:00,529
- What does that mean?
- I'm leaving.

481
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:03,627
You're leaving me now?
I need you!

482
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:06,229
You need nobody.

483
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,706
What does that mean?

484
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:11,643
Just take it easy!
What is my crime here?

485
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:14,272
Your crime is
that you use people!

486
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:18,307
- You're using Raymond, you're using me.
- I'm using Raymond?

487
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,377
Raymond, am I using you?

488
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:25,288
Shut up! He is answering a question
from a half hour ago!

489
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,293
What good is $3 million to him?

490
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:31,161
That money is only gonna sit there,
and I need that money.

491
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,497
You need it, so it's not Like stealing.
And then what happens to Raymond?

492
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:39,505
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or I'll put him in a better place.

493
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,974
- He is gonna be just the same.
- Only you have his money.

494
00:36:43,043 --> 00:36:47,377
His money? That man was my father too.
Where's my fuckin' half?

495
00:36:47,448 --> 00:36:50,076
- I'm entitled to that money!
- You kidnapped this man!

496
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,278
I did not take him.
I took my half.

497
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:56,322
- Charlie, you're crazy.
- It runs in the family.

498
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,850
You're soaking wet and you're gonna
Leave in the middle of the night. Wait.

499
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:04,364
My father stuck it to me all my Life.
What do you want from me?

500
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,524
I want out.

501
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,710
- Stop that.
- Good morning.

502
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:03,621
- Coffee?
- That'd be good.

503
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:09,027
Dibbs, Sally.
461-0192.

504
00:38:09,096 --> 00:38:11,587
How did you know
my phone number?

505
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:13,899
How'd you know that?

506
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:18,165
You said read the telephone book.
Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

507
00:38:19,106 --> 00:38:22,940
He remembers things,
little things, sometimes.

508
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,639
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.

509
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:29,580
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

510
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,845
Did you memorize the whole book?

511
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:34,854
- How far did you get?
- 'G.'

512
00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:37,220
'G.' Gottsaken, William Marshall.

513
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:40,089
- You memorized to 'G'?
- Yeah, 'G.'

514
00:38:41,161 --> 00:38:44,688
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G?
- Half of 'G.'

515
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,066
That's good, Ray.
I Like that.

516
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,801
- You hungry?
- Tuesday we have pancakes.

517
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:58,606
- That sounds good.
- Maple syrup.

518
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:01,170
- You bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

519
00:39:02,249 --> 00:39:05,116
They got pancakes.

520
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,417
- What is this, Ray?
- I don't have my toothpicks.

521
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:11,753
You don't need toothpicks.

522
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:15,124
That was okay in the hotel with pizza,
but in a restaurant you use a fork.

523
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:17,686
- I don't have my toothpicks.
- You don't need toothpicks.

524
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:19,891
The pancakes
will keep sliding off.

525
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:23,528
I don't have my maple syrup either.
I'm gonna be without my maple syrup.

526
00:39:23,604 --> 00:39:25,799
You don't see any pancakes,
do you?

527
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:28,171
Of course,
maple syrup is not here.

528
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:32,144
Ray, when we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

529
00:39:32,212 --> 00:39:35,306
Maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pancakes.

530
00:39:35,382 --> 00:39:36,815
We haven't ordered yet.

531
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:40,149
Maple syrup after the pancakes
is definitely too late.

532
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,953
How is that gonna be too late?
We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.

533
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:48,392
If we're gonna be here all morning
with no maple syrup and no toothpicks...

534
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:52,398
I'm definitely not gonna
have my pancakes with--

535
00:39:52,466 --> 00:39:54,730
Don't make a scene.

536
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:57,668
Stop actin' Like a fuckin' retard.

537
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:21,360
What are you writing?

538
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:24,363
What the fuck is this?

539
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:29,302
'Serious'-- 'Serious injury list:
Charlie Babbitt'?

540
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,270
'Serious injury list'?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

541
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,706
Number 18 in 1988.

542
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:39,741
Squeezed and pulled
and hurt my neck in 1988.

543
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,441
'Squeezed and pulled and hurt
your neck in 1988'?

544
00:40:45,118 --> 00:40:47,052
Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.

545
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,587
Where are you, son?

546
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,919
That's not important.
What matters is who I'm with.

547
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,721
You have to bring him back,
Mr. Babbitt. Do you understand me?

548
00:40:53,794 --> 00:40:54,920
No problem.

549
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:58,192
That will be $1.5 million.
I'm not greedy. I just want my half.

550
00:40:58,265 --> 00:40:59,698
Don't touch that.

551
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:02,826
I can't do that, Mr. Babbitt.
You know I can't.

552
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:05,303
Just bring him back,
and bring him back now.

553
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:06,805
He belongs here.

554
00:41:06,873 --> 00:41:10,036
I'm his brother.
It's not Like kidnapping here, is it?

555
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,136
He's always been a voluntary patient
here, but that's beside the point.

556
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:16,273
This is where he can get
the best care.

557
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,511
We're talking about his well-being.

558
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:21,213
Yeah. Let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?

559
00:41:21,288 --> 00:41:23,256
I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.

560
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:26,622
If you won't cut a deal with me,
I'll fly him back to Los Angeles...

561
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,627
I'll stick him in an institution
out there...

562
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:32,153
and we can have
a custody battle over him.

563
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:33,961
Miss, he needs toothpicks.

564
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,127
Could you get him some?
Thank you.

565
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,228
Now, you wanna battle me
in the courts?

566
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:41,570
You think about that, Dr. Bruner.
Think about that.

567
00:41:41,641 --> 00:41:43,609
Or we can cut a deal right now.

568
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,168
I don't think you have any idea
of the severity of Raymond's condition.

569
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:49,010
Toothpicks. He needs toothpicks.

570
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:52,108
Can we just get him
some toothpicks?

571
00:41:52,185 --> 00:41:54,551
I cannot make
money deals with you.

572
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:56,555
Then I'll see you in court.

573
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:04,126
Can I have the check?
Sorry about the toothpicks.

574
00:42:04,197 --> 00:42:06,665
82, 82, 82.

575
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,428
82 what, Ray?

576
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:10,936
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.

577
00:42:13,106 --> 00:42:15,040
That's more than 82 toothpicks.

578
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:18,271
246 total.

579
00:42:18,345 --> 00:42:19,676
Keep the change.

580
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:23,341
How many toothpicks are in there?

581
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:26,648
- 250.
- Pretty close. Let's go, Ray.

582
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,210
246.

583
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,653
There's four left in the box.

584
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:35,319
I have to get my backpack.

585
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:40,891
97X.

586
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:43,458
The future of rock and roll.

587
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:46,233
97X.

588
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:49,705
The future of rock and roll.

589
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:54,108
97X.

590
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:57,874
The future of rock and roll.

591
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,083
The future of rock and roll.

592
00:43:05,158 --> 00:43:06,147
Ray.

593
00:43:06,226 --> 00:43:08,194
Enough already.
Change the channel.

594
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:13,059
The future of rock and roll.

595
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:22,433
Lenny, I don't care what you think.
Did they say that?

596
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:24,704
You're gonna have to be
more forceful with them.

597
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:27,303
Lenny, are you--
Lenny, shut up a moment.

598
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,213
I am in serious trouble.
I can't get to these cars.

599
00:43:30,283 --> 00:43:32,342
I can't get the money.
Do you understand that?

600
00:43:32,419 --> 00:43:35,081
- My Loan is past due.
- I'll call the Loan officer...

601
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:37,316
tell him we have
a little problem.

602
00:43:38,425 --> 00:43:41,758
- Listen, Charlie, let me talk--
- Lenny, just listen to me.

603
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,853
I'll be in LAX
in three hours, okay?

604
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,832
Now, remember, the Buick
is in A-3, main terminal.

605
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:50,870
Make sure they pick it up.
All right? See you in a few.

606
00:43:55,909 --> 00:43:59,106
Will Dr. Andrew Baker...

607
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:01,807
please pick up
a white courtesy phone?

608
00:44:01,882 --> 00:44:03,816
- Dr. Andrew Baker.
- Raymond, let's go.

609
00:44:05,886 --> 00:44:08,650
Ray, let's go. Come on.

610
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,754
- What were you watching?
- I don't know.

611
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:15,124
You don't know?

612
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:18,653
Final call for flight 1559...

613
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:22,356
service to Salt Lake City
and Los Angeles.

614
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:26,283
There's an airplane out there.

615
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,385
That's right,
and everybody's boarding. Let's go.

616
00:44:28,463 --> 00:44:30,397
- Airline travel's very dangerous.
- Don't be silly.

617
00:44:30,465 --> 00:44:32,865
It's the safest travel in the world.
You'll love this. Trust me.

618
00:44:33,668 --> 00:44:35,158
Now come on.

619
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:40,036
We're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.

620
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:42,667
- Why do you think we're here?
- Flying's very dangerous.

621
00:44:42,743 --> 00:44:44,677
In 1987, there were
30 airline accidents.

622
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:47,942
211 were fatalities
and 230 were definitely passengers.

623
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:49,949
This plane is very safe.
Believe me.

624
00:44:50,017 --> 00:44:52,212
I gotta get to L.A.
I don't have time for this shit.

625
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:54,914
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

626
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:56,581
- You don't know?
- No.

627
00:44:56,657 --> 00:44:58,784
- Is it this airline?
- Yeah.

628
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:03,092
Okay, fine. We can--
There's an American plane.

629
00:45:03,164 --> 00:45:04,893
American flight 625...

630
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:07,491
crashed April 27, 1976.

631
00:45:08,736 --> 00:45:10,795
We don't have to take American.
There's a lot of flights.

632
00:45:10,872 --> 00:45:12,134
Pick another airline.

633
00:45:12,206 --> 00:45:16,575
- Continental. We'll take Continental.
- Continental crashed November 15, 1987.

634
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:19,112
Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

635
00:45:20,314 --> 00:45:22,248
- This is very serious.
- Yeah, very serious.

636
00:45:22,316 --> 00:45:25,808
I have to get to Los Angeles.
So you're gonna get on that plane.

637
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,411
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

638
00:45:27,488 --> 00:45:29,718
- You have to get on a plane.
- Yeah.

639
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:33,656
Now, there's a Delta.

640
00:45:33,728 --> 00:45:35,923
- Yeah.
- It leaves at midnight.

641
00:45:35,997 --> 00:45:37,123
How's Delta?

642
00:45:37,198 --> 00:45:40,690
Delta crashed August 2, 1985.
Lockheed L-1011.

643
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:42,759
Dallas-Fort Worth.
Terrible wind shear.

644
00:45:42,837 --> 00:45:45,032
- All airlines--
- 135 passengers.

645
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:47,506
All airlines have crashed
at one time or another.

646
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:49,543
That doesn't mean
that they are not safe.

647
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:51,339
- Quantas.
- Quantas?

648
00:45:51,412 --> 00:45:52,970
Quantas never crashed.

649
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:56,015
- Quantas?
- Never crashed.

650
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:59,213
- Well, that's--
- Never crashed.

651
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:01,221
That's gonna do me
a lot of good.

652
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:03,723
Quantas doesn't fly to L.A.
out of Cincinnati.

653
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:06,259
- You have got to get to Melbourne...
- Australia.

654
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:08,659
in order to get the plane
that flies to Los Angeles.

655
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:10,424
- Do you hear me?
- Canberra's the capital.

656
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:12,193
- 16.2 million population.
- Let's go.

657
00:46:12,266 --> 00:46:13,597
Very lovely beaches.

658
00:46:13,668 --> 00:46:16,569
We're getting on this plane!

659
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:22,732
Ray! Ray! Ray!

660
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:29,509
We're not gonna take the plane.
He's okay. He's okay!

661
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:31,575
We're not gonna take the plane.

662
00:46:33,254 --> 00:46:35,313
Just relax.
He was upset.

663
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:38,381
We were gonna take the plane.
We're not gonna take it now.

664
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:41,087
- We're not gonna fly, okay?
- No flying.

665
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:46,663
- We're not gonna fly.
- No flying.

666
00:46:47,835 --> 00:46:49,769
- You tire me, Ray.
- Yeah.

667
00:46:49,837 --> 00:46:51,930
We're gonna drive to Los Angeles.

668
00:46:53,074 --> 00:46:55,008
Okay? Come on, Ray.

669
00:46:55,076 --> 00:46:56,566
Ray? Come on.

670
00:46:56,644 --> 00:46:58,407
- Yeah.
- Come here.

671
00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:00,413
- No flying.
- We're not taking the plane.

672
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:02,540
- Just grab the fuckin' bag.
- No flying.

673
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,287
You're killin' me, Ray.
I just want you to know.

674
00:47:07,355 --> 00:47:09,289
- No flying.
- I gotta be in L.A. in three hours.

675
00:47:09,357 --> 00:47:11,325
It's gonna take me three days.

676
00:47:11,392 --> 00:47:12,791
Come on!

677
00:47:15,663 --> 00:47:17,062
No flying.

678
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:18,723
- No flying.
- No flying.

679
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:23,597
I got 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

680
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:26,003
- I watch 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.
- Don't start with that.

681
00:47:26,073 --> 00:47:28,007
'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

682
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:05,205
- Dispatch, this is 1-0-9.
- Go ahead, 1-0-9.

683
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:07,907
Can you get another unit here
for point control?

684
00:48:07,982 --> 00:48:10,450
Two more over to you. 10-40.

685
00:48:12,353 --> 00:48:14,014
Let's go!

686
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,615
- Bring some more up.
- What's your E.T.A.?

687
00:48:21,896 --> 00:48:22,954
Ray?

688
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:25,923
Get in the car.

689
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:29,028
Get in the car.
Are you crazy?

690
00:48:29,103 --> 00:48:30,934
We'll be outta this in a second.

691
00:48:31,005 --> 00:48:32,495
- Yeah.
- That's good.

692
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:34,700
It's okay. That's right.

693
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:37,608
Yeah. We'll be outta here
in a few seconds. That's good.

694
00:48:37,678 --> 00:48:41,011
- That's good. That's good.
- There's a fatal accident over there.

695
00:48:42,783 --> 00:48:45,274
We don't need your help.
Go back to your car.

696
00:48:45,352 --> 00:48:47,479
Just a minute!

697
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:53,686
Son of a bitch! Ray?

698
00:48:55,129 --> 00:48:56,460
Excuse-- Hey--

699
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,521
- Just wait--
- There's nothing to see here.

700
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,863
- Go back to your car.
- Yes, sir.

701
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:03,335
- Wrecks make him nervous.
- Get in your car.

702
00:49:03,404 --> 00:49:05,964
Yes, sir. Just stay there
by the side, okay, Raymond?

703
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,065
- Ray. Just stay there.
- A lot of traffic.

704
00:49:08,142 --> 00:49:10,508
Yeah.
Definitely a lot of traffic.

705
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:13,513
A lot of work for $3 million.

706
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:16,209
I'd Like to Leave him on the highway
and get outta here.

707
00:49:16,283 --> 00:49:18,979
What? I hear ya! I hear ya!

708
00:49:23,824 --> 00:49:26,486
- Memorial Hospital is ready--
- Stay in your car!

709
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:35,535
What's it gonna be, Ray?

710
00:49:35,603 --> 00:49:37,571
This is
a very dangerous highway.

711
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:39,105
How will I get to L.A.?

712
00:49:39,173 --> 00:49:41,733
Driving a car on this interstate
is very dangerous.

713
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:43,902
You wanna get off the highway?
Will that make you happy?

714
00:49:43,978 --> 00:49:46,208
- Yeah.
- Well, you gotta get in the car...

715
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,214
in order to get off the highway!

716
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:51,217
In 1986, 46,400 male drivers
were involved in fatal accidents.

717
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:56,348
I got a great idea.

718
00:49:56,423 --> 00:49:59,119
You'll stay in front of the car
until we get off the exit.

719
00:49:59,193 --> 00:50:02,959
You'll get in, and we'll take
the not-so-dangerous road.

720
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,463
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.

721
00:50:04,532 --> 00:50:06,796
Give me five, Ray.
That's a great idea.

722
00:50:06,867 --> 00:50:09,563
Give me five. Yeah.
This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake.

723
00:50:17,845 --> 00:50:20,643
I'm asking you. Who's on first?
That's the man's name.

724
00:50:20,714 --> 00:50:23,342
That's whose name? Yes.
Go ahead and tell me.

725
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:25,977
Who? The guy on first.
Who? The first baseman.

726
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:27,213
Who is on first.

727
00:50:28,122 --> 00:50:30,454
Whose wife? Yes.

728
00:50:30,524 --> 00:50:32,788
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

729
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,792
Absolutely.

730
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:36,489
All I'm tryin' to find out
is what the guy's name on first base.

731
00:50:36,564 --> 00:50:38,498
No, what is on second base.

732
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:41,296
I'm not asking you who's on second base?
Who's on first?

733
00:50:41,368 --> 00:50:43,666
- That's what I'm tryin' to find out.
- Get in the car!

734
00:50:43,737 --> 00:50:45,967
Don't change the players.
Yeah, get in the car.

735
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,134
Get in the car. Yeah.
I have to be in bed by 11:00.

736
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,678
Lights out at 11:00.
Have to watch TV.

737
00:50:57,685 --> 00:50:59,880
Now it's almost
19 minutes to 11:00.

738
00:50:59,954 --> 00:51:02,013
We have to be in bed by 11:00.
Lights out.

739
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:04,023
We're not flying.
We're not on the interstate.

740
00:51:04,091 --> 00:51:06,924
I'm on some shit secondary road.
I gotta make up time.

741
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:08,985
I should've been in Los Angeles
this afternoon.

742
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:10,928
My business needs me.
I gotta make up time.

743
00:51:10,998 --> 00:51:14,695
Definitely watch TV, but be
in bed by 11:00. Lights out.

744
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:15,962
Forget it.

745
00:51:16,036 --> 00:51:17,970
19 minutes to 11:00.

746
00:51:32,086 --> 00:51:34,987
This is a good one.
'We don't go out when it rains.'

747
00:51:35,055 --> 00:51:37,489
This is a good one.
I hope you appreciate this...

748
00:51:37,558 --> 00:51:39,958
because my business
is going down the toilet.

749
00:51:40,027 --> 00:51:41,654
I should be in L.A.

750
00:51:41,729 --> 00:51:45,722
Instead I'm in the Honeymoon Haven Motel
in Bumblefuck, Missouri...

751
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:47,892
because you won't
go out when it rains.

752
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:51,062
It's mystifying. It really is.
Fuckin' mystifying.

753
00:51:54,775 --> 00:51:57,471
What is this?
Good news, bad news?

754
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:00,413
We passed D.O.T.
but failed E.P.A. again.

755
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:02,574
It all ends up the same.
I can't get my money.

756
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:06,051
Well, yes, sir. I'm just stuck
in Cincinnati since the funeral.

757
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,055
So many leftover details.
My family is...

758
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:11,216
needless to say,
quite overwhelmed.

759
00:52:11,292 --> 00:52:13,522
Yeah, well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

760
00:52:13,594 --> 00:52:15,721
It is a shock, to say the least.

761
00:52:17,231 --> 00:52:19,893
Thank you. Can I get
an extension on that Loan?

762
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:22,936
A couple of days
would make a big difference.

763
00:52:30,577 --> 00:52:33,045
'We don't go out when it's raining.'

764
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:39,418
What? Speak up, Lenny.

765
00:52:39,486 --> 00:52:41,420
I didn't buy that kind of time.

766
00:52:41,488 --> 00:52:43,456
I want you to go down--
How much?

767
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:44,752
- It's 12:30.
- What?

768
00:52:44,825 --> 00:52:46,258
Lunch is 12:30.

769
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:48,693
- Hold on. What do you want for lunch?
- Wednesday's fish sticks.

770
00:52:48,762 --> 00:52:50,627
- Fish sticks?
- Green lime Jell-O for dessert.

771
00:52:50,698 --> 00:52:53,565
Green lime Jell-O.
Want another apple juice?

772
00:52:53,634 --> 00:52:56,364
I want orange soda.
Oh, it's 12:31.

773
00:52:56,437 --> 00:52:58,371
I gotta go.
He's startin' to rock and moan.

774
00:52:58,439 --> 00:53:00,873
- 12:32. Definitely 12:32.
- It's okay. No.

775
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:03,068
- Give me that gun.
- Where is he?

776
00:53:04,478 --> 00:53:05,706
Where is he?

777
00:53:05,779 --> 00:53:07,747
How did you figure
to frame Vargas with it?

778
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:10,807
'Frame'? Where is he?

779
00:53:10,884 --> 00:53:12,943
- There's four fish sticks.
- Huh?

780
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,454
There's supposed to be eight.
There's only four.

781
00:53:15,522 --> 00:53:17,285
There's eight.

782
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:19,588
You take a shower, Ray?

783
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,959
- Ray, you take a shower, right?
- Yeah.

784
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,658
It's the same as the rain.
You get a little wet.

785
00:53:25,733 --> 00:53:28,167
What do you say, Ray?

786
00:53:28,235 --> 00:53:30,203
'Course, the shower's
in the bathroom.

787
00:53:31,372 --> 00:53:33,101
That's the end
of that conversation.

788
00:53:34,241 --> 00:53:36,175
- Go again.
- British Poetry for 200.

789
00:53:36,243 --> 00:53:41,044
The answer: 'Shakespeare wrote
over 150 poems in this 14-line form.'

790
00:53:41,115 --> 00:53:43,083
- What is a sonnet?
- What is a sonnet?

791
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,084
- You got it.
- Double letters for 200.

792
00:53:45,152 --> 00:53:49,521
The top of that one. 'The last word
in the Pledge of Allegiance.' Mark.

793
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,955
- What is 'stands'?
- No.

794
00:53:51,025 --> 00:53:52,458
Stu, Stu, Stu.

795
00:53:52,526 --> 00:53:56,360
Legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?

796
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:01,261
He didn't figure anyone would show up
to contest his authority.

797
00:54:01,335 --> 00:54:04,634
If that's the case,
I definitely will get custody...

798
00:54:04,705 --> 00:54:06,639
and the $3 million, right?

799
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:11,167
And you set up a date-- Yeah, you set up
a date for the custody hearing.

800
00:54:11,245 --> 00:54:13,713
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.

801
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:16,272
I found that it wasn't
an original record...

802
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,511
because the original song
had two verses--

803
00:54:18,585 --> 00:54:22,021
She hasn't come in?
She hasn't called?

804
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:25,058
If you hear from her, tell her
to call me at this number.

805
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:40,433
The Air Alpha Force,
from Nike.

806
00:54:43,377 --> 00:54:46,904
Look at that.
1957 Studebaker Goldenhawk.

807
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,470
0 to 60 in under 8 seconds.

808
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:51,017
275 supercharged horsepower
under that hood.

809
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:53,576
- It's beautiful.
- 'Course, I'm an excellent driver.

810
00:54:53,654 --> 00:54:55,588
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.

811
00:54:56,557 --> 00:54:57,819
When did you drive?

812
00:54:57,891 --> 00:55:00,826
I drove the Buick on the driveway
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

813
00:55:02,596 --> 00:55:04,894
Was Dad in the car, Ray?

814
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:06,091
Yeah.

815
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:10,703
- He let you drive the Buick?
- Yeah, slow on the driveway.

816
00:55:12,806 --> 00:55:15,001
We'll have to let you
drive sometime.

817
00:55:17,511 --> 00:55:20,878
You never touch this steering wheel
when I'm driving! Do you hear me?

818
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:22,074
- Yeah.
- Do you hear me?

819
00:55:22,149 --> 00:55:25,050
- I don't have my underwear.
- What?

820
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,053
I'm definitely not wearing
my underwear.

821
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:30,215
-I gave you a pair of mine this morning.
-They're not my underwear.

822
00:55:31,658 --> 00:55:33,922
I told you to put 'em on.
Where are they?

823
00:55:33,994 --> 00:55:36,087
They're in the pocket of my jacket.

824
00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:37,460
- Where?
- Here.

825
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:41,027
- These are too tight.
- I don't want them back.

826
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:43,729
- Mine are boxer shorts.
- What's the difference?

827
00:55:43,804 --> 00:55:46,568
- These are Hanes 32.
- Underwear is underwear.

828
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,699
My boxer shorts have my name.
It says 'Raymond.'

829
00:55:48,775 --> 00:55:51,903
All right. When we pass a store,
we'll pick up some boxer shorts.

830
00:55:51,979 --> 00:55:54,846
I get my boxer shorts
at Kmart in Cincinnati.

831
00:55:54,915 --> 00:55:57,179
We're not going back.
Don't start with that.

832
00:55:57,251 --> 00:55:59,219
- 400 Oak Street.
- We're not going back.

833
00:55:59,286 --> 00:56:01,481
You don't have to go
to Cincinnati for boxer shorts.

834
00:56:01,555 --> 00:56:03,955
- Oak and Burnett in Cincinnati.
- What did I say?

835
00:56:04,024 --> 00:56:06,584
- It's Kmart.
- I know you hear me.

836
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,288
- My boxer shorts have--
- You don't fool me.

837
00:56:09,363 --> 00:56:10,455
Yours are too tight.

838
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:13,432
Did you fuckin' hear what I said?

839
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,592
Shut up!

840
00:56:17,971 --> 00:56:20,030
Cincinnati's a Long way off.

841
00:56:20,107 --> 00:56:22,940
You're getting further away
from Kmart.

842
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:25,740
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get underwear at Kmart.

843
00:56:25,812 --> 00:56:27,746
You have to go to Kmart,
400 Oak Street.

844
00:56:27,814 --> 00:56:30,078
We are not going to Cincinnati,
and that's final.

845
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,677
- Get my boxer shorts at Kmart.
- That is final. Did you hear me?

846
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,095
I'm goin' out of my mind!

847
00:56:43,163 --> 00:56:47,361
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

848
00:56:47,434 --> 00:56:51,063
What difference does it make?
Underwear is underwear!

849
00:56:51,138 --> 00:56:54,630
It is underwear wherever you buy it,
in Cincinnati or wherever!

850
00:56:55,742 --> 00:56:57,733
- Kmart.
- You know what I think?

851
00:56:57,811 --> 00:57:01,144
I think this autism
is a bunch of shit.

852
00:57:01,215 --> 00:57:04,241
You can't tell me that you're
not in there somewhere.

853
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:05,649
Boxer shorts.

854
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:08,145
Boxer shorts. Kmart.

855
00:57:09,456 --> 00:57:11,287
These are--
These are Hanes 32.

856
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:14,725
- Driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

857
00:57:14,795 --> 00:57:17,491
We have to make a little stop,
find a psychiatrist...

858
00:57:17,564 --> 00:57:19,498
'cause you're driving me crazy.

859
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:21,500
- Oak and Burnett.
- You are driving me--

860
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:23,627
We have to buy them at Kmart,
Oak and Burnett...

861
00:57:23,704 --> 00:57:25,399
back in--

862
00:57:25,472 --> 00:57:28,737
You put your shorts
on the highway.

863
00:57:28,809 --> 00:57:31,141
We have to go back
to Cincinnati and Kmart.

864
00:57:56,871 --> 00:57:59,305
Good luck finding
a shrink in this town.

865
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:31,831
Raymond?

866
00:59:13,348 --> 00:59:15,111
Hey, you.

867
00:59:15,183 --> 00:59:16,946
Dipshit, move it!

868
00:59:20,688 --> 00:59:22,622
If you ain't gonna move,
I'll move you.

869
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,783
Hey, buddy.

870
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:26,326
You'll get run over.

871
00:59:26,394 --> 00:59:28,885
- You're gonna get hurt.
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

872
00:59:28,963 --> 00:59:31,693
- Do you hear me?
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

873
00:59:31,766 --> 00:59:35,224
- Move it.
- Hey, it's all right, sir.

874
00:59:35,303 --> 00:59:37,294
I'm sorry. Raymond?

875
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:38,532
- Yeah.
- Come on.

876
00:59:38,606 --> 00:59:41,575
- It's all right.
- Gotta get to Kmart.

877
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:43,577
Raymond, come on.

878
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:45,670
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

879
00:59:45,747 --> 00:59:47,681
- It said, 'Don't walk.'
- Yes, it's broken.

880
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:49,683
It said, 'Don't walk.'

881
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:52,845
- This way.
- Have to get to Kmart.

882
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:55,651
400 Oak and Burnett.

883
00:59:58,793 --> 01:00:01,057
He said, 'Young man, go west'...

884
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:03,597
and this is the way
our country developed...

885
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:06,395
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

886
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:09,232
During that period of time...

887
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:11,829
there was initiated...

888
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:16,104
what was known as
the Pony Express.

889
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:19,977
I'm sure you have read something about
it in the history of the United States.

890
01:00:20,048 --> 01:00:22,881
I may not have the days
or the years exactly right...

891
01:00:22,951 --> 01:00:27,547
but I'm more or less familiar
with the history of the United States.

892
01:00:27,622 --> 01:00:30,455
- I love to tell the story--
- He's 'artistic'?

893
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:32,083
No, he's autistic.

894
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,890
I'm not familiar with that.

895
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:36,863
What is the exact nature
of the problem?

896
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:38,455
...in St. Joe's, Missouri--

897
01:00:38,533 --> 01:00:40,865
He lives in a world of his own.

898
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,564
I'm sorry,
but what's wrong with him?

899
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,699
It was a problem gettin' mail
from the East Coast--

900
01:00:47,775 --> 01:00:51,871
-Raymond, do 'What's On First?' for her.
-Who's on first. What's on second.

901
01:00:54,482 --> 01:00:58,418
They set up an initial program...

902
01:00:58,486 --> 01:01:00,545
where the Pony Express...

903
01:01:00,622 --> 01:01:04,615
would ride for approximately
20 miles--

904
01:01:04,692 --> 01:01:07,422
What am I supposed to do?

905
01:01:07,495 --> 01:01:10,259
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.

906
01:01:10,331 --> 01:01:12,265
Well, I'm not a psychiatrist...

907
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:14,927
but I do know his brain doesn't work
Like other people.

908
01:01:15,003 --> 01:01:16,971
What he does
isn't intended to be annoying.

909
01:01:17,038 --> 01:01:20,064
If he's gettin' on your nerves,
take a break.

910
01:01:20,141 --> 01:01:23,008
- Spend time away from him.
- I'll just send him back.

911
01:01:23,077 --> 01:01:25,068
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

912
01:01:25,146 --> 01:01:28,274
Inside joke. You're telling me
I just have to deal with this?

913
01:01:28,349 --> 01:01:30,442
I just gotta deal with it.

914
01:01:30,518 --> 01:01:33,419
Yeah, that's about it.

915
01:01:33,488 --> 01:01:36,423
Out of curiosity, does he have
any special abilities?

916
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:40,361
Well, he's got
a pretty good memory.

917
01:01:40,428 --> 01:01:42,419
He counts toothpicks.

918
01:01:42,497 --> 01:01:44,692
They spilled a box of toothpicks
on the floor...

919
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:47,735
and he took one look and knew
exactly how many there were.

920
01:01:47,802 --> 01:01:51,067
- He counted 'em in seconds.
- Ray.

921
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:52,436
- Raymond.
- Yeah.

922
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:54,475
Are you good with numbers?

923
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:57,375
- Yeah.
- I read about this.

924
01:01:57,445 --> 01:01:59,504
- I wanna try somethin' here.
- Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

925
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:01,913
What'd I tell you?
After this.

926
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,451
- Ray, can we try somethin'?
- Yeah.

927
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:07,454
Do you know how much 312...

928
01:02:07,522 --> 01:02:09,820
times 123 is?

929
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:12,382
38,376.

930
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,018
He's right.

931
01:02:14,095 --> 01:02:15,858
- What?
- He's right.

932
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,898
- He's right?
- Yeah. Ray.

933
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:21,367
How much is 4,343...

934
01:02:21,436 --> 01:02:24,633
times 1,234?

935
01:02:24,706 --> 01:02:26,697
5,359,262.

936
01:02:26,774 --> 01:02:28,742
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

937
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:31,802
- He's a genius.
- Ray.

938
01:02:31,879 --> 01:02:35,246
Do you know how much
the square root of 2,130 is?

939
01:02:36,851 --> 01:02:40,651
46.15192304.

940
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:43,550
- 2304.
- That's amazing.

941
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:46,719
That is amazing. He should
work for NASA or something.

942
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:52,657
If you had a dollar,
and you spent 50 cents...

943
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:54,827
how much money
would you have left?

944
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,766
About 70.

945
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:01,775
- Seventy cents?
- Seventy cents.

946
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:04,937
- So much for NASA.
- We should go to Kmart.

947
01:03:05,013 --> 01:03:06,674
After this, Ray.

948
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:08,409
400 Oak Street.

949
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:10,417
Do you know how much
a candy bar costs?

950
01:03:11,586 --> 01:03:14,180
- About $100.
- $100, huh?

951
01:03:14,255 --> 01:03:16,587
You know how much one of those
new compact cars costs?

952
01:03:16,658 --> 01:03:18,148
About $100.

953
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:23,293
In his case, he's pretty well off.
He's very high-functioning.

954
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:27,733
Most autistics can't speak
or communicate.

955
01:03:29,337 --> 01:03:31,396
Do you know what 'autistic' is?

956
01:03:31,472 --> 01:03:32,962
- Yeah.
- You know that word?

957
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:37,611
Are you autistic?

958
01:03:39,113 --> 01:03:40,580
I don't think so.

959
01:03:41,649 --> 01:03:44,117
No. Definitely not.

960
01:03:49,057 --> 01:03:50,820
...problem with the Lamborghinis.

961
01:03:50,892 --> 01:03:53,292
Let me see if I understand this.

962
01:03:53,361 --> 01:03:56,296
It's gonna cost me
$10,000 additional for each car.

963
01:03:56,364 --> 01:04:00,357
- It's very crowded in here.
- Ray, please, just one second, okay?

964
01:04:00,435 --> 01:04:01,697
What?

965
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:04,101
They wanna take out the manifold
and the carburetors...

966
01:04:04,172 --> 01:04:06,231
in order to put in
a fuel injection system now?

967
01:04:06,307 --> 01:04:07,774
That is nonsense.

968
01:04:07,842 --> 01:04:10,572
- What are you doing?
- Too crowded in here for a backpack.

969
01:04:10,645 --> 01:04:15,082
Just Leave this on. It's gonna cost me
$40,000 just to meet E.P.A. now.

970
01:04:15,149 --> 01:04:16,776
What? No.

971
01:04:16,851 --> 01:04:20,617
You give me the number.
I'll call the conversion shop myself.

972
01:04:20,688 --> 01:04:22,622
That's my pen.
That's definitely my book.

973
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,851
Taking your book
is not a serious injury.

974
01:04:24,926 --> 01:04:27,360
For serious injury, look at
the red book. That book is blue.

975
01:04:27,428 --> 01:04:30,158
Forgive me. I've lost
my secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

976
01:04:30,231 --> 01:04:32,961
- You're already number 18.
- Got it. 1988, I know.

977
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:35,264
It's my book.
That's my pen.

978
01:04:35,336 --> 01:04:37,361
12 minutes to Wapner.

979
01:04:37,438 --> 01:04:41,101
- It's definitely very small in here.
- Small... and safe.

980
01:04:41,175 --> 01:04:43,905
- You don't wanna miss the party.
- What you're witnessing is real.

981
01:04:43,978 --> 01:04:46,811
Do you know that?
There's a party in your honor, Ray.

982
01:04:46,881 --> 01:04:49,975
When we get to L.A., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up.

983
01:04:50,051 --> 01:04:52,952
You know why there's a party for you?
'Cause you're the 3-million-dollar man.

984
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,954
- What you are witnessing is real.
- Ken Aldorf.

985
01:04:55,022 --> 01:04:56,956
- The participants are not actors.
- Charlie Babbitt.

986
01:04:57,024 --> 01:04:59,458
- Fart.
- Yeah, I'll hold.

987
01:04:59,527 --> 01:05:01,620
- Fart.
- Did you fart?

988
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:03,823
- Fart.
- Did you fuckin' fart?

989
01:05:03,898 --> 01:05:06,833
Oh, man.
Get the smell out.

990
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:11,195
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

991
01:05:11,272 --> 01:05:13,206
- Ken Aldorf.
- Ten minutes to Wapner.

992
01:05:13,274 --> 01:05:15,208
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

993
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:17,210
We're definitely locked in this box
with no TV.

994
01:05:17,278 --> 01:05:19,473
I just heard about this $10,000 charge
for every car.

995
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:21,811
- They're definitely gonna start--
- How can this be?

996
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:25,785
- 'People's Court' starts on the--
- You're telling me another $40,000.

997
01:05:25,853 --> 01:05:28,549
They start on the button.
They definitely start on the button.

998
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:31,592
I've got a problem.
I'll call you from my next stop.

999
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:34,423
We're not gonna make it
to the program.

1000
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:37,055
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

1001
01:05:37,131 --> 01:05:39,565
- Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

1002
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:41,727
Where am I gonna find
a television around here?

1003
01:05:41,803 --> 01:05:44,465
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

1004
01:06:01,659 --> 01:06:03,650
Come on. Come on.

1005
01:06:04,562 --> 01:06:06,587
You wanna get in there
and see the show?

1006
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:09,963
Wanna get in and see the show?
Listen up.

1007
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:13,128
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it.

1008
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:18,373
You act weird, we don't get in.
You Listening to me?

1009
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:20,376
- Yeah.
- I want you to look normal.

1010
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:22,469
As normal as possible, all right?

1011
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:24,673
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

1012
01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:27,309
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

1013
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:30,548
- Yeah. Uh--
- Don't rock and moan.

1014
01:06:30,621 --> 01:06:32,179
Put your hands down.

1015
01:06:35,526 --> 01:06:39,462
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

1016
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:42,931
- You're familiar with our work?
- You mean the TV ratings?

1017
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,935
Yes, ma'am. You've been selected
as a preliminary candidate...

1018
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:49,097
to become our next Nielsen family
in the tri-county area.

1019
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:52,199
- My husband's not home.
- If selected, you'll help shape...

1020
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:56,042

01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:58,138
in return for which
you'll receive a check...

1022
01:06:58,215 --> 01:07:00,809
in the amount of $286 each month.

1023
01:07:00,885 --> 01:07:02,876
Who's he?

1024
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:06,651
That would be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample--

1025
01:07:10,328 --> 01:07:13,263
- That's it.
- Oh, boy.

1026
01:07:13,331 --> 01:07:14,662
You'll miss your program.

1027
01:07:14,732 --> 01:07:17,132
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

1028
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:18,930
One minute to Wapner.

1029
01:07:19,003 --> 01:07:22,336
I had you in there, Ray!

1030
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:24,567
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

1031
01:07:24,642 --> 01:07:27,668
They're in there
making legal history, Ray.

1032
01:07:27,745 --> 01:07:29,679
- Legal history.
- Oh, boy!

1033
01:07:29,747 --> 01:07:32,113
- Oh, boy.
- What is going on out here?

1034
01:07:32,183 --> 01:07:36,643
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you.
That man is my brother.

1035
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:38,848
If he doesn't watch 'People's Court'
in about 30 seconds...

1036
01:07:38,923 --> 01:07:40,857
he'll have a fit on your porch.

1037
01:07:40,925 --> 01:07:43,917
Now, you can help me, or you
can stand there and watch it happen.

1038
01:07:45,196 --> 01:07:48,529
We Like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

1039
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:52,057
...and she sees an identical twin.

1040
01:07:52,136 --> 01:07:55,264
True, he didn't have his shirt on--
the other one did--

1041
01:07:55,339 --> 01:07:57,807
but they sure look alike to me.

1042
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:01,367
If it got on his chest, even if it
didn't burn or got real cold--

1043
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:04,414
- I put my hand on the dry ice.
- Daddy's not here now.

1044
01:08:04,482 --> 01:08:08,350
I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.

1045
01:08:08,419 --> 01:08:11,320
I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.

1046
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:13,880
If I put it up
against a bare chest--

1047
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:16,051
Ken, work with me.
I'll take care of you--

1048
01:08:18,863 --> 01:08:22,629
- You know that song?
- My judgment is for the defendant.

1049
01:08:25,603 --> 01:08:28,037
We'll be back for the reaction...

1050
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:30,596
to Judge Wapner's decision
right after these messages.

1051
01:09:08,012 --> 01:09:10,845
- My credit card's been rejected?
- Yes, sir.

1052
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:13,383
Must be some accounting error.
How much will this cost?

1053
01:09:13,451 --> 01:09:14,713
Twenty dollars, sir.

1054
01:09:18,823 --> 01:09:20,347
Thank you.

1055
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,862
I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a Long time.

1056
01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:04,867
- Definitely gonna be a Long journey.
- Just a couple of more days.

1057
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:07,904
You know the fella's name?
Then who's playing first?

1058
01:10:07,972 --> 01:10:10,964
- The fella playing first for St. Louie?
- You gonna start with this again?

1059
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:13,908
It's just another motel.
You gotta do this every time?

1060
01:10:13,978 --> 01:10:15,912
That's the man's name.
That's whose name.

1061
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:18,642
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

1062
01:10:18,716 --> 01:10:21,981
Who is on first.
I'm asking you, who's on first?

1063
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:24,020
- Yo, Ray.
- That's the man's name.

1064
01:10:24,088 --> 01:10:27,285
- This is not a riddle.
- Yeah. Know the fella's name?

1065
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:30,486
-Yeah. Then who's playing first base?
-You'll never figure out who's on first.

1066
01:10:30,561 --> 01:10:34,292
Who is on first.
That's the joke. It's comedy.

1067
01:10:34,365 --> 01:10:36,356
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1068
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:37,695
- Whose wife?
- It's comedy.

1069
01:10:37,768 --> 01:10:39,827
Every dollar of it. Yeah.

1070
01:10:39,904 --> 01:10:41,838
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1071
01:10:41,906 --> 01:10:43,840
It's a routine
between Abbott and Costello.

1072
01:10:43,908 --> 01:10:46,968
When you do it, you're not funny.
You're Abbott and Abbott.

1073
01:10:47,044 --> 01:10:48,443
- Yeah.
- You understand me?

1074
01:10:48,512 --> 01:10:50,707
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1075
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:52,043
Whose wife? Yeah.

1076
01:10:52,116 --> 01:10:54,277
- Ray?
- Yeah.

1077
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:56,285
- You are never gonna solve it.
- Yeah.

1078
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:58,981
You know why?
It's not a riddle.

1079
01:10:59,056 --> 01:11:00,990
And if you understood that...

1080
01:11:01,058 --> 01:11:04,425
if you understood that it's funny,
you might get better.

1081
01:11:04,495 --> 01:11:07,020
All I'm trying to find out
is what's the guy's name on first base.

1082
01:11:07,097 --> 01:11:11,158
What's the guy's name on first base? No,
what's the guy's name on second base.

1083
01:11:11,235 --> 01:11:13,169
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1084
01:11:13,237 --> 01:11:15,171
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1085
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,640
You know the fella's name?
Yeah.

1086
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:20,643
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1087
01:11:20,711 --> 01:11:22,679
The fella playing first for St. Louie.
Who.

1088
01:11:22,746 --> 01:11:24,714
The guy on first.
Who. The first baseman.

1089
01:11:24,782 --> 01:11:26,647
Who is on first.
What are you asking me for?

1090
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:29,117
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1091
01:11:29,186 --> 01:11:31,120
All right, Ray. Come on.

1092
01:11:31,188 --> 01:11:33,452
We're gonna put the bed
by the window...

1093
01:11:33,524 --> 01:11:37,756
we got your apple juice, we'll put
the pens and paper on the table.

1094
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:41,330
- Did I forget something?
- The cheeseballs.

1095
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:43,866
- Yes.
- Definitely have cheeseballs.

1096
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:46,994
- I forgot the cheeseballs. We got 'em.
- I have to have 12 cheeseballs.

1097
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:49,437
- Yes, definitely.
- Get my tartar-control toothpaste.

1098
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:51,531
We got that for you
a couple of days ago.

1099
01:11:51,609 --> 01:11:53,042
Where's my toothpaste?

1100
01:11:55,112 --> 01:11:56,374
Raymond.

1101
01:11:58,515 --> 01:12:01,609
Remember that doctor asked you
those number questions today?

1102
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:04,153
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

1103
01:12:04,221 --> 01:12:05,916
I see it.

1104
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,514
I see it.

1105
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:09,559
What's that?
Will you stop for a second?

1106
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:11,060
I see it.

1107
01:12:11,128 --> 01:12:13,619
Put that down.
I'm trying to talk to you.

1108
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:15,961
When I say stop it,
why don't you stop it?

1109
01:12:16,033 --> 01:12:19,002
Why do you always have to act
Like an idiot?

1110
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:21,435
- Yeah.
- You think that's funny?

1111
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:23,473
Yeah, funny Rain Man.
Funny teeth.

1112
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,508
- What'd you say?
- Funny teeth.

1113
01:12:25,576 --> 01:12:27,009
Rinse.

1114
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:35,750
Why'd you say--
Why'd you say funny teeth?

1115
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:37,787
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

1116
01:12:39,156 --> 01:12:41,147
'Rain man'?
I said, 'Rain man'?

1117
01:12:41,225 --> 01:12:43,159
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1118
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,963
Was I trying to say 'Raymond'
and it came out 'rain man'?

1119
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:51,001
Yeah. Funny Rain Man.

1120
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,929
You? You're the rain man?

1121
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:12,214
- Who took this picture?
- D-a-d.

1122
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:16,690
- You lived with us?
- Yeah, 10961 Beechcrest Street...

1123
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,354
Cincinnati, Ohio.

1124
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:21,990
When did you Leave?

1125
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:24,000
January 21, 1965.

1126
01:13:25,069 --> 01:13:27,560
- You remember then?
- It was Thursday. Very snowy out.

1127
01:13:27,638 --> 01:13:30,300
7.2 inches. Snow that day.

1128
01:13:32,209 --> 01:13:35,144
- Just after Mom died. New Year's.
- Yeah, Mom died.

1129
01:13:35,212 --> 01:13:37,146
January 5, 1965.

1130
01:13:37,214 --> 01:13:39,273
And you remember that day
that you left?

1131
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:42,410
- Short and sudden illness.
- You remember that day you left?

1132
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:46,012
Was I there? Where was l?

1133
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:49,116
You were in the window.
You waved to me.

1134
01:13:49,193 --> 01:13:51,821
'Bye-bye, Rain Man.
Bye-bye, Rain Man.'

1135
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:55,130
So, you--

1136
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,598
- You were the one that sang to me?
- Yeah.

1137
01:14:00,371 --> 01:14:04,307
What did you sing?
What was that song?

1138
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,444
What did you sing?

1139
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:13,014
She was just seventeen

1140
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:16,712
You know what I mean

1141
01:14:16,787 --> 01:14:20,951
And the way she looked
was way beyond compare

1142
01:14:22,226 --> 01:14:27,926
So how could I dance
with another

1143
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:34,327
When I saw her standing there

1144
01:14:39,343 --> 01:14:41,277
Did I Like it
when you sang to me?

1145
01:14:43,747 --> 01:14:47,114
Did we sing any other songs
Like the Beatles?

1146
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,585
Scary! Hot! Scary bad!

1147
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:56,524
Scary bad! Scary!

1148
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:03,458
What's scary about it?

1149
01:15:03,534 --> 01:15:05,627
Hot water burn baby!

1150
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:09,001
- Water!
- 'Hot water burn baby'?

1151
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:11,233
- What baby? Me?
- Yeah.

1152
01:15:11,308 --> 01:15:13,003
- Yeah.
- Easy, easy.

1153
01:15:13,076 --> 01:15:16,534
- Water-- Hot water burn baby.
- I'm not burned.

1154
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:18,877
I'm not burned.
Look at me, please.

1155
01:15:18,949 --> 01:15:21,008
- Water burn baby.
- Please. Please!

1156
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:23,985
Hot water burn--
Tub burn baby.

1157
01:15:24,054 --> 01:15:26,488
- I'm not burned.
- Tub burn baby.

1158
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:28,491
- I'm not burned.
- Yeah.

1159
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,524
I'm not burned. It's okay.

1160
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:37,065
It's okay.

1161
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:46,138
Time for Wallbrook now.

1162
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,610
That's why they put you away.

1163
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:50,613
They thought you'd hurt me.

1164
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,411
Never hurt baby.

1165
01:15:55,486 --> 01:15:57,920
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1166
01:15:57,988 --> 01:16:00,889
Never hurt Charlie.

1167
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:02,892
What? What?

1168
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,327
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1169
01:16:07,231 --> 01:16:08,289
What, Ray?

1170
01:16:12,269 --> 01:16:13,531
What?

1171
01:16:18,108 --> 01:16:20,042
Come on. It's 11:00, Ray.

1172
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:22,044
- Lights out.
- Yeah.

1173
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:34,950
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1174
01:16:42,132 --> 01:16:45,067
There you go. Right where you Like 'em,
at the end of the bed.

1175
01:16:57,114 --> 01:16:58,376
Come on, Ray.

1176
01:17:46,129 --> 01:17:48,063
Hi, it's me.

1177
01:17:48,131 --> 01:17:50,292
You didn't hang up.
Does that mean we're engaged?

1178
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:52,993
Listen, l, uh--

1179
01:17:55,339 --> 01:17:57,273
I just wanna hear it's not over.

1180
01:17:59,276 --> 01:18:01,301
I'm scared it's over.

1181
01:18:01,378 --> 01:18:04,313
Don't ask me tonight.
I don't know what to say.

1182
01:18:04,381 --> 01:18:07,782
- Let it sit.
- Something I'm not real good at.

1183
01:18:07,851 --> 01:18:10,786
There are a lot of things
that you're not good at.

1184
01:18:10,854 --> 01:18:12,788
I'll call you
when I get back, okay?

1185
01:18:16,827 --> 01:18:18,761
- I'll see you.
- Ciao.

1186
01:19:45,964 --> 01:19:50,367
Why are you looking at that? I bought
a TV, and you're watching a dryer.

1187
01:19:50,436 --> 01:19:52,233
I don't know.

1188
01:19:52,304 --> 01:19:54,397
Because at the shrink hearing,
we'll have to prove...

1189
01:19:54,473 --> 01:19:58,239
you prefer to watch TV as opposed to
the clothes dryer, you understand that?

1190
01:19:58,310 --> 01:19:59,902
- Yeah.
- You Listening to me?

1191
01:20:01,447 --> 01:20:03,438
Turn this off
when you're not watching it.

1192
01:20:03,515 --> 01:20:05,540
- Yeah.
- You'll run down the batteries.

1193
01:20:05,617 --> 01:20:07,881
Then where will you be
at 3:00 when Wapner's on?

1194
01:20:07,953 --> 01:20:10,353
Yeah. The red one
always falls the same.

1195
01:20:10,422 --> 01:20:12,583
Why don't you listen to me?

1196
01:20:12,658 --> 01:20:14,592
You don't wanna
listen to me, do you?

1197
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,594
You wanna go back to Wallbrook?

1198
01:20:16,662 --> 01:20:19,495
I gotta make
a phone call.

1199
01:20:30,275 --> 01:20:31,765
Lenny, it's me.

1200
01:20:31,844 --> 01:20:34,779
Where have you been? I've been
sittin' by this phone for three hours.

1201
01:20:34,847 --> 01:20:36,781
I had to buy some clothes.

1202
01:20:36,849 --> 01:20:39,784
Clothes? Charlie, we are
in serious trouble.

1203
01:20:39,852 --> 01:20:42,082
- Why are you buyin' clothes?
- Take it easy.

1204
01:20:42,154 --> 01:20:44,088
I'm in Tucumcari.
I'll be there--

1205
01:20:44,156 --> 01:20:46,920
They repossessed the cars
to pay off the Loan.

1206
01:20:46,992 --> 01:20:49,654
The cars are gone, Charlie.

1207
01:20:49,728 --> 01:20:52,595
And Bateman wants
his down payment back. They all do.

1208
01:20:52,664 --> 01:20:54,529
That's 80,000, Charlie.

1209
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,369
80,000. I don't have it.

1210
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:01,463
You gotta pay these people back,
or it's all over.

1211
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:04,873
We're out of business.
What am I gonna tell 'em?

1212
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,069
I don't know.

1213
01:21:23,195 --> 01:21:25,789
Son of a bitch!

1214
01:21:25,864 --> 01:21:28,594
Son of a bitch!

1215
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:05,895
This would be easier
if you let me put the top up.

1216
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:07,905
You wouldn't have to fry.

1217
01:22:07,973 --> 01:22:10,373
Put this lotion on
so you don't burn.

1218
01:22:10,442 --> 01:22:13,434
Don't start with that.
You want me to put the top up?

1219
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:17,107
- I definitely Like the top down.
- I know. I don't want you to burn.

1220
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,481
Definitely Like it
when the top's--

1221
01:22:20,552 --> 01:22:22,884
It's all right.
Just take it easy.

1222
01:22:22,955 --> 01:22:25,048
- Oh, no.
- It's almost over.

1223
01:22:25,123 --> 01:22:27,387
Uh-huh. All right.
How does that feel?

1224
01:22:27,459 --> 01:22:28,983
Very slippery.

1225
01:22:38,804 --> 01:22:43,605
Maldonado swings, and there's
a base hit into center field.

1226
01:22:44,943 --> 01:22:46,274
One run is in.
Here's Brenly going to third.

1227
01:22:46,345 --> 01:22:48,779
The throw by Davis... not in time.

1228
01:22:50,282 --> 01:22:52,682
Brenly in safely
at third base...

1229
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:54,685
on Maldonado's single.

1230
01:22:54,753 --> 01:22:58,416
He held that ball too Long
in center field, don't you think so?

1231
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:00,481
We'll look at it again.

1232
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:05,690
Treadwell playing way over towards
the right side, shaded him to pull.

1233
01:23:07,332 --> 01:23:08,264
Here's Davis.

1234
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:13,534
Yeah, he seems to hold it there
just a bit, Tom.

1235
01:23:13,605 --> 01:23:16,369
Sort of double-pumped it.
Watch the replay.

1236
01:23:16,441 --> 01:23:19,433
He loses all chance
on a play on Brenly...

1237
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:22,537
even though Brenly
doesn't exactly run fast.

1238
01:23:23,849 --> 01:23:27,945
And the throw into third base
finally is a little bit high.

1239
01:24:00,018 --> 01:24:01,952
Will you give me
a break with this?

1240
01:24:06,058 --> 01:24:07,320
Ray, stop it.

1241
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:24,039
J-7.

1242
01:24:25,944 --> 01:24:27,878
- K-7? What's that?
- J-7.

1243
01:24:30,082 --> 01:24:31,344
What's J-7?

1244
01:24:33,552 --> 01:24:35,611
What's J-7? The song?

1245
01:24:45,063 --> 01:24:48,499
Look out there, Raymond.
No, out here.

1246
01:24:51,203 --> 01:24:53,103

1247
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,696

1250
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:07,484
D-1. D-1.

1251
01:25:11,123 --> 01:25:13,057
'Blue Moon of Kentucky,'
Bill Monroe.

1252
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:15,059
And the Bluegrass Boys. K-5.

1253
01:25:18,263 --> 01:25:20,254
How many toothpicks
came out of that box?

1254
01:25:20,332 --> 01:25:21,629
246.

1255
01:25:23,268 --> 01:25:25,236
- Yeah.
- 246.

1256
01:25:26,605 --> 01:25:28,630
- Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

1257
01:25:34,112 --> 01:25:36,080
- You watching that?
- Yeah.

1258
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:43,053
- You seeing that, Ray?
- Yeah. Falling on the ground.

1259
01:25:46,124 --> 01:25:50,083
Okay. Now what do I have left?

1260
01:25:50,162 --> 01:25:52,357
Two jacks, one 8,
one king, one 6...

1261
01:25:52,431 --> 01:25:56,197
two aces, one 10, one 9, one 5.

1262
01:25:56,268 --> 01:25:58,202
One 5.

1263
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:00,238
You are beautiful, man.

1264
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:25,362
- I'm an excellent driver.
- You can't drive now, Ray.

1265
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,660
You Listening to me?
This is very important.

1266
01:26:27,732 --> 01:26:31,224
When there's lots of tens and picture
cards left, then it's good for us.

1267
01:26:31,303 --> 01:26:33,771
- Say it. 'Tens are good.'
- Tens are good.

1268
01:26:33,839 --> 01:26:36,808
- Okay. And you're gonna bet one--
- One if it's bad.

1269
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:40,140
- Two if it's good.
- That's right. Two if it's good.

1270
01:26:40,212 --> 01:26:42,442
Now, listen.
Casinos have house rules.

1271
01:26:44,182 --> 01:26:46,116
The first one is,
they don't Like to lose.

1272
01:26:47,686 --> 01:26:50,484
So you never, never show
that you are counting cards.

1273
01:26:50,555 --> 01:26:52,819
That is the cardinal sin, Ray.

1274
01:26:52,891 --> 01:26:55,519
Are you Listening to me?
That's very, very important.

1275
01:26:55,594 --> 01:26:58,461
Yeah. Counting is bad.

1276
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:00,122
Yes. Counting is bad.

1277
01:27:01,032 --> 01:27:02,966
I Like to drive
slow on the driveway.

1278
01:27:03,034 --> 01:27:07,266
You get this right, you can drive
wherever you want as slow as you Like.

1279
01:27:07,339 --> 01:27:09,500
I'm an excellent driver.

1280
01:27:41,306 --> 01:27:44,707
Miss Sue Morgan, please pick up
the hotel courtesy phone.

1281
01:29:31,249 --> 01:29:32,716
- Rain Man?
- Yeah.

1282
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:35,155
- Let's play some cards.
- Yeah.

1283
01:29:44,698 --> 01:29:47,428
- You want a hit?
- No. You've got 18.

1284
01:29:47,501 --> 01:29:49,594
- Want a hit.
- Sir, you have 18.

1285
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:52,070
- He doesn't want a hit. Hit me.
- Definitely want a hit.

1286
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:53,106
Hitting 18.

1287
01:29:53,173 --> 01:29:55,437
- He doesn't want a hit.
- Hit me.

1288
01:29:57,745 --> 01:30:00,646
You took my queen. I've got a ten.
I needed that queen.

1289
01:30:00,714 --> 01:30:02,978
- I can't take it.
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.

1290
01:30:03,951 --> 01:30:06,385
- I need my own queen.
- There's lots of them.

1291
01:30:07,888 --> 01:30:09,856
- 'There's lots of them'?
- Lots and lots of them.

1292
01:30:10,924 --> 01:30:12,892
Hold on here for a second.

1293
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:18,064
I'm gonna double down.

1294
01:30:19,133 --> 01:30:21,567
Queen. Queen.

1295
01:30:21,635 --> 01:30:23,330
- Queen.
- Yes!

1296
01:30:23,404 --> 01:30:25,838
Yes, sir.
You gotta love this town.

1297
01:30:27,508 --> 01:30:29,874
I'm goin' for it, Nick.

1298
01:30:29,943 --> 01:30:32,935
It certainly looks Like it.

1299
01:30:49,029 --> 01:30:51,896
- You wanna bet one chip or two chips?
- Bet two.

1300
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:53,758
Bet two?

1301
01:31:40,581 --> 01:31:42,071
What's your secret, guys?

1302
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:45,482
We cheat.

1303
01:31:45,552 --> 01:31:49,147
This is Sam.

1304
01:31:55,829 --> 01:31:57,956

1305
01:31:58,031 --> 01:32:00,465

1306
01:32:00,534 --> 01:32:03,697
- Sam did.
- Okay, I'll take over from here.

1307
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,374

You're doing well.
I'm happy for you, sir.

1310
01:32:20,287 --> 01:32:21,720
What do you see?

1311
01:32:21,789 --> 01:32:25,190
He's not catching the hole card,
and he's not past posting us.

1312
01:32:25,259 --> 01:32:28,956
- He's not using a computer.
- No, but something's not right.

1313
01:32:29,029 --> 01:32:31,554
No one can count
into a six-deck shoe.

1314
01:33:05,766 --> 01:33:07,028
Hold it here.

1315
01:33:09,336 --> 01:33:12,237
- Watch my chips. I'll be back.
- Go ahead, sir.

1316
01:33:15,442 --> 01:33:19,242
What are you doing?
You don't Leave in the middle of a hand.

1325
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,941

01:33:59,586 --> 01:34:02,214
Little black-- No? Easy, easy.

1329
01:34:02,289 --> 01:34:04,382
Don't start banging yourself.

1330
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:07,086
- Maybe we'll play later.
- Yeah.

1331
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,685
- I'm gonna cash in.
- Yeah, cash in.

1332
01:34:09,763 --> 01:34:12,061

And I owe--

1338
01:34:27,114 --> 01:34:29,514
What did I say I owe
to get the Rolex back?

1339
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:33,019
- $3,500, six months to pay.
- $3,500.

1340
01:34:33,086 --> 01:34:36,419
We don't have to pay for a room.
That's comped. I'm free and clear.

1341
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:38,549
I'm gonna take a celebration piss.

1342
01:34:41,361 --> 01:34:44,524
Don't go anywhere. Until I get back,
the sign says, 'Don't walk.'

1343
01:34:44,598 --> 01:34:46,589
- Don't walk.
- Don't walk.

1344
01:35:08,488 --> 01:35:11,116

You don't know.

1351
01:35:22,102 --> 01:35:25,799
If you gave me a chance, you would.
Why don't we get to know each other?

1352
01:35:25,872 --> 01:35:29,308
- To get to know each other.
- He doesn't have any money, honey.

1369
01:36:21,261 --> 01:36:23,195

You don't realize how good you look.

1383
01:36:58,432 --> 01:37:00,366

There's a lot of lights out there.
It's very sparkly. Very twinkly.

1400
01:37:50,317 --> 01:37:53,718
We made a lot of money today.

1401
01:37:53,787 --> 01:37:57,951
Forgetting the $3,000 that we
tossed away at that wheel of fortune.

1402
01:37:58,024 --> 01:38:00,015
Yeah, 'Wheel Of Fortune.'

1403
01:38:00,093 --> 01:38:03,392
And I'm sorry about that.
I got a little carried away.

1404
01:38:03,463 --> 01:38:07,194
I got a little hot, Ray.

1405
01:38:07,267 --> 01:38:11,533
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry, and I just
want you to know that I am sorry.

1406
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:17,843
I'm apologizing. I got
a little carried away. The money.

1407
01:38:17,911 --> 01:38:22,041
I got a little greedy.
Wanna say somethin'?

1408
01:38:22,115 --> 01:38:24,709
I have to be at the bar

1409
01:38:24,785 --> 01:38:27,015
I gotta thank you, man.

1420
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:58,934
- I have to learn to dance with a date.
- I was just kidding.

1421
01:38:59,005 --> 01:39:01,235
You're not gonna have to
dance on this date.

1422
01:39:01,308 --> 01:39:05,039
I have to go to the date,
learn to dance. Definitely. Now.

1423
01:39:05,112 --> 01:39:07,137
You don't have to dance now...

1424
01:39:07,214 --> 01:39:09,876
but I'll teach you
how to dance sometime.

1425
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:13,477
- You won't have to dance on this.
- Have to learn how to dance now.

1426
01:39:13,553 --> 01:39:17,819
I'm sorry I brought this up.
All right, Ray, my mistake.

1427
01:39:17,891 --> 01:39:20,826
You got the only
famous dancing hooker in Vegas.

1428
01:39:20,894 --> 01:39:22,327
Stand over there.

1429
01:39:30,804 --> 01:39:33,170
- Come over here.
- Yeah.

1430
01:39:34,274 --> 01:39:37,607
You hear the music?
Just watch my feet.

1431
01:39:37,677 --> 01:39:40,145
Raymond, watch my feet.

1432
01:39:40,213 --> 01:39:43,239
Just do what I'm doin'. Okay?

1433
01:39:43,316 --> 01:39:47,252
You feel the rhythm of the music?
We're just movin' our feet.

1434
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:50,653
You're the guy,
so you're gonna have to lead.

1435
01:39:50,724 --> 01:39:53,249
I'm the date, so you want to--

1436
01:39:55,362 --> 01:39:58,695
You wanna put your
left hand up Like this.

1437
01:39:58,765 --> 01:40:02,223
Raymond, don't stop movin'.
Payin' attention?

1438
01:40:02,302 --> 01:40:06,204
Put your left hand up Like this.
Left hand. That's good.

1439
01:40:06,273 --> 01:40:09,504
Don't stop movin'.
Good. Just Like that.

1440
01:40:09,576 --> 01:40:12,010
Take this other hand,
put it behind my back.

1441
01:40:12,078 --> 01:40:15,104
- Ray, you wanna learn how to dance?
- Yeah.

1442
01:40:15,182 --> 01:40:18,481
You gotta touch someone when you dance.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1443
01:40:18,552 --> 01:40:21,885
All right?
Just put it right there.

1444
01:40:21,955 --> 01:40:24,446
I take my hand,
I put it up here.

1445
01:40:24,524 --> 01:40:26,617
Watch my feet, Ray.

1446
01:40:26,693 --> 01:40:30,754
The rhythm, the rhythm.
All right?

1447
01:40:30,830 --> 01:40:34,994
You can't watch my feet the whole time,
so you're gonna have to look up.

1448
01:40:35,068 --> 01:40:38,731
Now when I tell you to,
I want you to just look up...

1449
01:40:38,805 --> 01:40:41,330
real slow, just keep movin'.

1450
01:40:41,408 --> 01:40:43,342
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1451
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:45,640
- Start lookin' up.
- Yeah.

1452
01:40:45,712 --> 01:40:47,976
A little more.
Keep movin'.

1453
01:40:48,048 --> 01:40:50,676
- Just a little more.
- Yeah.

1454
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,877
A little more, Ray.

1455
01:40:52,953 --> 01:40:55,046
All the way up.

1456
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:59,991
There you go, Ray.
You're dancin'.

1457
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:04,360
- Yeah, dancin'.
- You wanna close your hand here.

1458
01:41:04,431 --> 01:41:08,094
You wanna put it Like that.
You're gonna turn me Like this.

1459
01:41:09,169 --> 01:41:11,797
Just turn me.
That's good.

1460
01:41:11,871 --> 01:41:14,339
- This is dancin'.
- This is dancing.

1461
01:41:14,407 --> 01:41:17,843
I don't know about you,
but I'm startin' to feel a little silly.

1462
01:41:51,077 --> 01:41:53,739
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1463
01:41:53,813 --> 01:41:55,075
All right!

1464
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:57,149
You are a good dancer.

1465
01:41:57,217 --> 01:41:59,777
- You wanna give me a hug?
- Yeah.

1466
01:42:11,898 --> 01:42:14,992
I just wanted to
give you a hug, Ray.

1467
01:42:16,369 --> 01:42:19,736
I just felt Like givin' you a hug.

1468
01:42:34,888 --> 01:42:36,321
What are you doin' here?

1469
01:42:36,389 --> 01:42:39,790
- I'm unemployed.
- What do you mean?

1470
01:42:39,859 --> 01:42:43,727
- You don't know about the business?
- Yeah, I know. Come on in.

1471
01:42:45,965 --> 01:42:48,991
I'm glad to see you.

1472
01:42:49,069 --> 01:42:50,661
Ray, look who's here.

1473
01:43:15,428 --> 01:43:18,761
It's not right,
what you're doing to Raymond.

1474
01:43:18,832 --> 01:43:21,357
- He's fine.
- I know he's fine.

1475
01:43:21,434 --> 01:43:26,133
He's in Las Vegas in a suit
in a big room. It makes me sad.

1476
01:43:26,206 --> 01:43:28,333
Six minutes to my date.

1477
01:43:28,408 --> 01:43:31,104
Six minutes to Iris.

1478
01:43:31,177 --> 01:43:32,610
He has a date?

1479
01:43:34,214 --> 01:43:38,207
Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't
carry that television everywhere we go.

1480
01:43:38,284 --> 01:43:40,878
Why do you have to bring
a Watchman on your date?

1481
01:43:40,954 --> 01:43:42,888
A man's dancing.

1482
01:43:42,956 --> 01:43:46,221
But what does your date
look Like, Raymond?

1483
01:43:46,292 --> 01:43:49,056
She's very sparkly.
She looks Like a holiday.

1484
01:43:51,164 --> 01:43:54,065
- I haven't heard that one before.
- Mr. Babbitt?

1485
01:43:54,134 --> 01:43:57,331
- Mr. Kelso would Like to see you.
- I don't know Mr. Kelso.

1486
01:43:57,404 --> 01:44:00,965
He's director of security.
Would you come with me, please?

1487
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,372
Sure. Susanna,
you stay with Raymond.

1488
01:44:03,443 --> 01:44:05,877
- Right this way.
- Certainly.

1489
01:44:21,094 --> 01:44:23,085
10:01, she's not here.

1490
01:44:23,163 --> 01:44:25,461
She'll come. She will.

1491
01:44:34,774 --> 01:44:38,801
Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.
Counting into a six-deck shoe is a feat.

1492
01:44:38,878 --> 01:44:41,745
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1493
01:44:41,815 --> 01:44:44,978
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,
and we analyze the tapes...

1494
01:44:45,051 --> 01:44:48,418
and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.

1495
01:44:48,488 --> 01:44:52,083
These tapes suggest that you should
take your winnings and Leave the state.

1496
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:54,626
Someone has a good day
at the tables...

1497
01:44:54,694 --> 01:44:57,288
and you accuse them
of illegal activities?

1498
01:44:57,363 --> 01:44:59,558
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

1499
01:44:59,632 --> 01:45:01,896
All you have to do is
close your mouth and go home.

1500
01:45:01,968 --> 01:45:06,701
Those are the best odds you're
gonna see for a while. I'd take 'em.

1501
01:45:15,849 --> 01:45:18,784
- Did you want to dance on your date?
- Yeah.

1502
01:45:18,852 --> 01:45:23,084
There'll be other chances. Many pretty
girls would love to dance with you.

1503
01:45:23,156 --> 01:45:25,590
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.

1504
01:45:43,343 --> 01:45:46,244
- I Like this music, Ray.
- Elevator stopped.

1505
01:45:46,312 --> 01:45:50,612
It's okay. You think you could show me
how you were going to dance with Iris?

1506
01:45:50,683 --> 01:45:52,548
- Yeah.
- Yes?

1507
01:45:52,619 --> 01:45:55,884
- Would you Like to dance with me?
- Elevator's on hold.

1508
01:45:55,955 --> 01:45:58,355
- Give me this.
- Yeah.

1509
01:46:00,894 --> 01:46:03,454
- Yeah.
- Show me how.

1510
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:05,623
Charlie Babbitt taught me.

1511
01:46:05,698 --> 01:46:08,132
- Charlie Babbitt?
- Yeah.

1512
01:46:08,968 --> 01:46:12,028
Dancing in the elevator.

1513
01:46:12,105 --> 01:46:13,868
It's nice.

1514
01:46:16,476 --> 01:46:17,909
You're very good.

1515
01:46:31,457 --> 01:46:35,188
- Iris missed a beautiful dance.
- Yeah.

1516
01:46:36,429 --> 01:46:39,193
- And a kiss.
- Yeah, a kiss.

1517
01:46:39,265 --> 01:46:42,359
- Have you ever kissed a girl?
- I don't know.

1518
01:46:43,603 --> 01:46:45,867
You don't know?

1519
01:46:47,206 --> 01:46:50,175
Open your mouth. Open.

1520
01:46:50,243 --> 01:46:52,643
- Yeah.
- Like this.

1521
01:46:52,712 --> 01:46:56,478
Like you were tasting
something very good...

1522
01:46:56,549 --> 01:46:59,017
and very soft.

1523
01:47:02,155 --> 01:47:05,318
Like this.
Close your eyes.

1524
01:47:12,131 --> 01:47:14,565
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

1525
01:47:22,842 --> 01:47:25,333
- How was that?
- Wet.

1526
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:30,149
- Then we did it right.
- Elevator's definitely stuck.

1527
01:47:30,216 --> 01:47:31,706
No, it's not stuck.

1528
01:47:36,289 --> 01:47:37,415
Here.

1529
01:47:39,492 --> 01:47:42,290
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

1530
01:47:43,563 --> 01:47:45,893
- Like us.
- Yeah, Like us.

1531
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:49,987
What'd I tell you, Ray?
I promised you could drive.

1532
01:47:50,064 --> 01:47:53,795
- At Wallbrook, I drive on the driveway.
- Charlie, this is okay?

1533
01:47:53,868 --> 01:47:56,302
- I'm an excellent driver.
- He's good on a driveway.

1534
01:48:55,063 --> 01:48:57,327
Ray, why don't you
get in the front seat?

1535
01:48:58,933 --> 01:49:01,401
So, I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?

1536
01:49:01,469 --> 01:49:04,131
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine.

1537
01:49:04,205 --> 01:49:06,605
- Yeah. I'm nervous.
- I know.

1538
01:49:06,674 --> 01:49:10,508
Listen, I'm glad, happy--
I'm happy that you came to Vegas.

1539
01:49:10,578 --> 01:49:13,172
I know.

1540
01:49:14,182 --> 01:49:15,615
Ciao.

1541
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:21,054
Ray, thank you for the date
in the elevator. It was really nice.

1542
01:49:21,122 --> 01:49:23,056
- Yeah.
- Ciao.

1543
01:49:23,124 --> 01:49:26,321
- Thank you for the what?
- It's something between us.

1544
01:49:26,394 --> 01:49:28,760
- Between us?
- Us.

1545
01:49:32,333 --> 01:49:34,096
Us, Ray?

1546
01:49:39,474 --> 01:49:42,443
Here we go, Ray.
This is your bedroom up here.

1547
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:45,138
Of course, there's
definitely no bed there.

1548
01:49:45,213 --> 01:49:49,343
No, this is a magic bed, Ray.
You just watch and see.

1549
01:49:49,417 --> 01:49:53,444
We got the table over here.
We got the television, Ray.

1550
01:49:53,521 --> 01:49:56,456
Went to the video store.
Got a surprise for you, Ray.

1551
01:49:56,524 --> 01:49:59,186
Picked up a video for you.

1552
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:02,388
Don't start with that, Ray.

1553
01:50:02,463 --> 01:50:06,126
It's not just another place, Ray.
This is my place.

1554
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,862
I'm asking you who's on first.
That's the man's name.

1555
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:11,427
Who? The first baseman.
Who is on first.

1556
01:50:11,506 --> 01:50:14,998
You got a first baseman on first?
Certainly. Then who's playing first?

1557
01:50:18,613 --> 01:50:21,047
- The man's entitled to it.
- Who is?

1558
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:23,208
Yes.

1559
01:50:23,284 --> 01:50:25,218
- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?

1560
01:50:25,286 --> 01:50:27,220
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1561
01:50:27,288 --> 01:50:29,882
- Whose wife?
- Yes.

1562
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:31,891
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

1563
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:33,654
Absolutely.

1564
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:36,128
All I'm tryin' to find out is
what's the guy's name on first base?

1565
01:50:36,197 --> 01:50:38,392
No, What is on second base.

1566
01:50:38,466 --> 01:50:42,061
- Don't you think this is funny?
- Yes, it's funny.

1567
01:50:44,071 --> 01:50:47,302
- Where'd you see this first?
- Dad gave me a book on baseball trivia.

1568
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:49,536
- Dad, huh?
- Yeah.

1569
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:52,545
- Guess it didn't read as funny.
- Definitely not.

1570
01:50:54,081 --> 01:50:57,778
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.
I'd Like you to call me.

1571
01:50:57,852 --> 01:50:59,376
Yeah, what is it?

1572
01:50:59,453 --> 01:51:02,718
I thought I got the machine.

1573
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:06,521
I just got into town, and the
psychological interview is tomorrow.

1574
01:51:06,594 --> 01:51:08,619
Yes, sir, I know that.

1575
01:51:08,696 --> 01:51:11,028
I thought we should
get together and talk.

1576
01:51:11,098 --> 01:51:15,057
I think it might be in your
best interests to meet me.

1577
01:51:15,136 --> 01:51:16,398
When?

1578
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:19,633
I'm at the Bonaventure.
How about tonight at 8:30?

1579
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:45,988
Tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston,
who's in charge of Raymond's evaluation.

1580
01:51:46,067 --> 01:51:49,559
- Yeah, I know.
- I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.

1581
01:51:49,637 --> 01:51:52,435
- Good luck.
- This isn't a close call.

1582
01:51:52,506 --> 01:51:55,407
It's a formality. Your brother's
a very disabled individual.

1583
01:51:55,476 --> 01:51:58,343
Are you trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?

1584
01:51:58,412 --> 01:52:01,472
No, I'm telling you
it's always been a lost cause.

1585
01:52:01,549 --> 01:52:04,313
- Then why did you call me?
- Let me tell you something.

1586
01:52:04,385 --> 01:52:07,047
Your father put me in charge
of all the money.

1587
01:52:07,121 --> 01:52:09,988
It doesn't matter whether or not
you win custody of Raymond.

1588
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:13,356
I won't have to pay you a dime.
It's at my discretion.

1589
01:52:13,427 --> 01:52:17,625
- So you can't lose?
- I can lose Raymond.

1590
01:52:17,698 --> 01:52:20,496
I care about your brother's Life
and the treatment he receives.

1591
01:52:20,568 --> 01:52:23,833
I made a commitment to your father
some 20 years ago...

1592
01:52:23,904 --> 01:52:26,236
and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.

1593
01:52:26,307 --> 01:52:28,172
What is this?

1594
01:52:28,242 --> 01:52:29,834
It's a very big check.

1595
01:52:33,447 --> 01:52:35,108
$250,000.

1596
01:52:35,182 --> 01:52:38,583
And no strings attached.
Just walk away, Charlie.

1597
01:52:39,854 --> 01:52:42,288
This isn't about you and me.

1598
01:52:42,356 --> 01:52:44,517
It's not about winning or losing.

1599
01:52:46,861 --> 01:52:50,695
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

1600
01:52:50,765 --> 01:52:52,824
You didn't have an answer.

1601
01:52:53,901 --> 01:52:56,028
I don't know.

1602
01:52:57,438 --> 01:52:59,702
I just realized
I'm not pissed off anymore...

1603
01:52:59,774 --> 01:53:02,140
my father cut me out of his will.

1604
01:53:03,711 --> 01:53:07,374
You probably knew he tried
to contact me over the years.

1605
01:53:07,448 --> 01:53:10,008
I never called him back.
I was a prick.

1606
01:53:10,084 --> 01:53:13,918
If he was my son and didn't return
my calls, I'd have written him out.

1607
01:53:13,988 --> 01:53:16,582
But it's not about
the money anymore.

1608
01:53:17,825 --> 01:53:20,851
You know,
I just don't understand.

1609
01:53:20,928 --> 01:53:23,954
Why didn't he tell me
I had a brother?

1610
01:53:24,031 --> 01:53:27,694
Why didn't anyone ever tell me
that I had a brother?

1611
01:53:31,238 --> 01:53:35,402
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.

1612
01:55:20,214 --> 01:55:22,808
Ray! Come on.

1613
01:55:22,883 --> 01:55:25,852
It stopped.
It's all right.

1614
01:55:32,626 --> 01:55:34,617
V-E-R-N.

1615
01:55:34,695 --> 01:55:36,959
Vern. Vern.

1616
01:55:37,031 --> 01:55:39,898
My main man, Vern.

1617
01:55:39,967 --> 01:55:42,401
V-E-R-N.

1618
01:55:49,243 --> 01:55:51,507
My main man, Vern.

1619
01:55:54,181 --> 01:55:57,536
V-E-R-N.
Vern, my main man.

1620
01:55:57,603 --> 01:56:00,197
They got raspberry, blueberry...

1621
01:56:00,272 --> 01:56:02,968
whole wheat, peachy keen,
beer nut, rocky road, buckwheat.

1622
01:56:03,042 --> 01:56:06,341
How about buckwheat?
What kind of pancakes you want, Ray?

1623
01:56:06,412 --> 01:56:08,277
- Pancakes.
- What kind?

1624
01:56:08,347 --> 01:56:10,144
- Pancakes.
- Of course.

1625
01:56:10,216 --> 01:56:13,049
The maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pan--

1626
01:56:17,189 --> 01:56:19,783
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1627
01:56:19,859 --> 01:56:22,293
- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

1628
01:56:42,014 --> 01:56:43,948
Step back a little bit.

1629
01:57:04,236 --> 01:57:05,669
Hello?

1630
01:57:06,739 --> 01:57:09,503
Why don't you go
sit down over there?

1631
01:57:13,179 --> 01:57:14,612
Hello?

1632
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:18,480
This is not a legal proceeding,
so there's no judge present...

1633
01:57:18,551 --> 01:57:21,384
just the people
who care about Raymond.

1634
01:57:21,454 --> 01:57:25,322
Raymond, have a seat over there.
Mr. Babbitt, other side of the table.

1635
01:57:25,391 --> 01:57:27,951
Raymond, right here.
How about this seat?

1636
01:57:28,027 --> 01:57:31,394
- Take this seat.
- Put your knapsack on the floor.

1637
01:57:31,464 --> 01:57:34,729
This is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.

1638
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,032
Ray, the TV?
On the floor. I'm sorry.

1639
01:57:39,105 --> 01:57:42,404
I don't know an easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt--

1640
01:57:42,475 --> 01:57:44,409
Have I lost already?

1641
01:57:44,477 --> 01:57:46,945
No, you haven't lost.
I'm not the judge and jury.

1642
01:57:47,012 --> 01:57:49,207
I'm just making
a recommendation to a court.

1643
01:57:49,281 --> 01:57:52,944
I must tell you that Dr. Bruner
is a very respected professional.

1644
01:57:53,018 --> 01:57:56,010
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years...

1645
01:57:56,088 --> 01:57:59,057
and Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions in this country.

1646
01:57:59,125 --> 01:58:01,559
You've made up your mind.
I'll see you in court.

1647
01:58:01,627 --> 01:58:05,154
My brother came further with me
than he did with you in 20 years.

1648
01:58:05,231 --> 01:58:07,722
- It's not necessary to--
- You don't know anything about us.

1649
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:11,327
- It's not necessary to challenge him.
- I'm sorry.

1650
01:58:11,403 --> 01:58:13,667
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?

1651
01:58:13,739 --> 01:58:16,469
- We got to know each other.
- I was asking Raymond.

1652
01:58:16,542 --> 01:58:19,739
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

1653
01:58:19,812 --> 01:58:21,803
- What did you do?
- Counted cards.

1654
01:58:21,881 --> 01:58:23,974
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.

1655
01:58:24,049 --> 01:58:27,951
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- Lost $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

1656
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:29,954
Gave you $3,000 to gamble with?

1657
01:58:30,022 --> 01:58:33,185
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

1658
01:58:33,259 --> 01:58:35,625
- And what else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

1659
01:58:35,694 --> 01:58:38,788
- What else did you do?
- Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

1660
01:58:38,864 --> 01:58:40,855
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn.

1661
01:58:40,933 --> 01:58:43,766
Danced in the elevator with Susanna.
Kissed Susanna.

1662
01:58:43,836 --> 01:58:46,100
- You kissed Susanna?
- Yeah, in the elevator.

1663
01:58:46,172 --> 01:58:49,232
- Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
- I don't know.

1664
01:58:49,308 --> 01:58:51,572
- How did it feel?
- It felt wet.

1665
01:58:51,644 --> 01:58:53,111
- Wet?
- Yeah.

1666
01:58:53,179 --> 01:58:55,909
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

1667
01:58:55,981 --> 01:58:59,041
- Did you enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an excellent driver.

1668
01:58:59,118 --> 01:59:01,211
- You drove?
- Yeah.

1669
01:59:01,287 --> 01:59:04,779
-Your brother let you drive the highway?
-Slow on the driveway.

1670
01:59:04,857 --> 01:59:08,190
He didn't drive on the highway.

1671
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:10,922
- Did he have any emotional outbursts?
- What do you mean?

1672
01:59:10,996 --> 01:59:15,262
Well, things they tend to do when--
Inflict bodily harm on themselves.

1673
01:59:15,334 --> 01:59:17,825
- Yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

1674
01:59:17,903 --> 01:59:21,498
He had what you call an outburst at
the airport because he didn't wanna fly.

1675
01:59:21,574 --> 01:59:24,441
- So we didn't fly.
- When was his last outburst?

1676
01:59:24,510 --> 01:59:26,740
- This morning when--
- This morning?

1677
01:59:26,812 --> 01:59:30,407
This is bullshit, because I could
tell you anything or tell you nothing.

1678
01:59:30,482 --> 01:59:33,747
You'd never know the difference.
This morning the smoke alarm went off.

1679
01:59:33,819 --> 01:59:35,753
He got nervous,
but he's fine now.

1680
01:59:35,821 --> 01:59:38,153
Don't feel as I'm
placing any blame.

1681
01:59:38,224 --> 01:59:40,818
We went out for pancakes.
He's fine.

1682
01:59:40,893 --> 01:59:44,260
- You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm just being honest with you.

1683
01:59:44,330 --> 01:59:47,163
- You're missing the point.
- I'm being truthful about this.

1684
01:59:47,233 --> 01:59:49,201
I'm not placing any blame--

1685
01:59:49,268 --> 01:59:52,362
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all.

1686
01:59:52,438 --> 01:59:56,169
I find out now that I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?

1687
01:59:56,242 --> 01:59:58,176
No one is saying anything.

1688
01:59:58,244 --> 02:00:01,042
I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me,
we're not hurting you.

1689
02:00:01,113 --> 02:00:03,547
- Why are you interfering?
- I'm not interfering.

1690
02:00:03,616 --> 02:00:06,449
- This is my family.
- I understand that.

1691
02:00:06,518 --> 02:00:10,318
Your brother is not capable
of having a relationship with you.

1692
02:00:10,389 --> 02:00:14,951
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

1693
02:00:15,027 --> 02:00:18,258
You cannot care for your brother
without professional guidance.

1694
02:00:18,330 --> 02:00:21,094
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

1695
02:00:21,166 --> 02:00:23,100
There's some things
I'd Like to go over.

1696
02:00:23,168 --> 02:00:26,797
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution...

1697
02:00:26,872 --> 02:00:29,739
and were willing to trade him
for $1.5 million, correct?

1698
02:00:29,808 --> 02:00:31,639
My father died.
I was upset.

1699
02:00:31,710 --> 02:00:33,405
That was wrong.

1700
02:00:33,479 --> 02:00:36,880
Last week you were upset, and this week
you've found a devotion to him...

1701
02:00:36,949 --> 02:00:39,509
and you want to
take care of him.

1702
02:00:39,585 --> 02:00:41,746
Yes.

1703
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:44,914
From the beginning
it was Like a kidnapping.

1704
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:47,788
Kidnapping. That's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.

1705
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:51,523
But in the course of a week, you came
to have an understanding with him.

1706
02:00:51,597 --> 02:00:52,859
Yes.

1707
02:00:52,932 --> 02:00:55,196
- Look, that--
- Yes?

1708
02:00:55,267 --> 02:00:58,293
I understand that this sounds
irrational to you.

1709
02:00:58,370 --> 02:01:00,361
When it started out--

1710
02:01:00,439 --> 02:01:03,374
- Don't feel compelled to be defensive.
- Can I talk?

1711
02:01:03,442 --> 02:01:06,104
- Yes, you can.
- Thank you.

1712
02:01:06,178 --> 02:01:09,011
There's no accusations.
Go ahead.

1713
02:01:09,081 --> 02:01:11,481
No accusations?

1714
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:14,576
See, you have to understand...

1715
02:01:14,653 --> 02:01:18,885
that when we started out together
that he was only my brother...

1716
02:01:18,958 --> 02:01:20,550
in name.

1717
02:01:24,396 --> 02:01:25,988
And then...

1718
02:01:29,134 --> 02:01:31,329
this morning we had pancakes.

1719
02:01:31,403 --> 02:01:33,428
Maple syrup.
Maple syrup on the--

1720
02:01:33,505 --> 02:01:35,996
Maple syrup on the table.

1721
02:01:36,075 --> 02:01:38,509
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1722
02:01:39,678 --> 02:01:40,940
See, we--

1723
02:01:42,748 --> 02:01:44,409
I made a connection.

1724
02:01:44,483 --> 02:01:46,883
I think it's admirable
that you made a connection...

1725
02:01:46,952 --> 02:01:50,353
but the purpose of this meeting is to
determine what is best for Raymond...

1726
02:01:50,422 --> 02:01:53,220
whether or not he's capable
of functioning in the community...

1727
02:01:53,292 --> 02:01:56,887
and what, in fact, he wants,
if that's possible to determine.

1728
02:01:56,962 --> 02:01:58,327
I'm all for that.

1729
02:01:58,397 --> 02:02:01,560
- Raymond's unable to make decisions.
- You're wrong.

1730
02:02:01,633 --> 02:02:03,567
He can't decide for himself.

1731
02:02:03,635 --> 02:02:06,001
He's capable
of a lot more than you know.

1732
02:02:06,071 --> 02:02:08,437
Why don't we ask Raymond?

1733
02:02:08,507 --> 02:02:12,307
Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions?

1734
02:02:12,378 --> 02:02:15,108
- The doctor's talking to you.
- Can I ask you a few questions?

1735
02:02:18,083 --> 02:02:20,017
Do you wanna stay
with your brother?

1736
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:25,019
Raymond, would you Like to stay
with your brother in Los Angeles?

1737
02:02:25,090 --> 02:02:27,581
The doctor's asking you a question.

1738
02:02:27,659 --> 02:02:29,786
- So you listen.
- Yeah.

1739
02:02:29,862 --> 02:02:33,855
Raymond, do you wanna stay
with your brother Charlie?

1740
02:02:33,932 --> 02:02:36,992
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1741
02:02:37,069 --> 02:02:39,128
- You do?
- Yeah.

1742
02:02:39,204 --> 02:02:40,466
You wanna stay with your brother?

1743
02:02:40,539 --> 02:02:43,940
Yeah. I wanna stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

1744
02:02:44,009 --> 02:02:46,477
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

1745
02:02:47,713 --> 02:02:50,443
- You wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1746
02:02:53,819 --> 02:02:56,515
- Can I ask you something else?
- Yeah.

1747
02:02:56,588 --> 02:02:59,648
- You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1748
02:02:59,725 --> 02:03:03,684
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

1749
02:03:03,762 --> 02:03:05,195
Yeah.

1750
02:03:06,532 --> 02:03:10,696
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1751
02:03:10,769 --> 02:03:12,669
- Or do you wanna go to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1752
02:03:12,738 --> 02:03:14,797
They're two separate things.

1753
02:03:14,873 --> 02:03:18,707
Your brother or Wallbrook?
It's not one thing, Raymond.

1754
02:03:18,777 --> 02:03:22,304
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Okay.

1755
02:03:22,381 --> 02:03:26,340
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Can you make that choice?

1756
02:03:26,418 --> 02:03:28,852
- One or the other.
- Go back to Wallbrook.

1757
02:03:28,921 --> 02:03:30,320
All right.

1758
02:03:30,389 --> 02:03:32,550
Just hold on here.

1759
02:03:32,624 --> 02:03:34,216
All right.

1760
02:03:34,293 --> 02:03:37,524
All right.
You made your point.

1761
02:03:37,596 --> 02:03:41,726
You don't have to humiliate him.
Ray, it's okay.

1762
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:43,927
- It's over.
- Yeah.

1763
02:03:44,002 --> 02:03:46,937
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

1764
02:03:47,005 --> 02:03:49,235
- Stay back at Wallbrook--
- It's over.

1765
02:03:50,275 --> 02:03:52,266
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

1766
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:57,071
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?

1767
02:03:57,149 --> 02:03:58,946
Excuse me.

1768
02:04:07,044 --> 02:04:09,478
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

1769
02:04:11,315 --> 02:04:14,773
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1770
02:04:17,187 --> 02:04:19,121
I don't know.

1771
02:04:24,494 --> 02:04:28,021
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1772
02:04:31,935 --> 02:04:34,665
- There won't be any more questions.
- Yeah.

1773
02:04:34,738 --> 02:04:38,265
- I'll make sure of that.
- Yeah, main man.

1774
02:04:39,610 --> 02:04:41,771
- What?
- My main man.

1775
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:47,783
Listen.

1776
02:04:51,421 --> 02:04:54,686
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna
have a chance to talk to you again.

1777
02:04:58,028 --> 02:05:00,588
Because you see, these--

1778
02:05:00,664 --> 02:05:04,930
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,
and he's probably gonna take you back.

1779
02:05:05,836 --> 02:05:07,963
- You know?
- Yeah.

1780
02:05:09,606 --> 02:05:13,736
What I said about being
on the road with you I meant.

1781
02:05:14,811 --> 02:05:16,608
Connecting.

1782
02:05:17,948 --> 02:05:22,317
- I Like having you for my brother.
- I'm an excellent driver.

1783
02:05:22,386 --> 02:05:25,287
Yes, you are.

1784
02:05:52,549 --> 02:05:55,177
I Like having you
for my big brother.

1785
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:16,202
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1786
02:06:19,309 --> 02:06:21,937
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1787
02:06:23,146 --> 02:06:24,909
Main man.

1788
02:06:58,115 --> 02:07:00,242
May I have your attention, please?

1789
02:07:00,317 --> 02:07:04,447
Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound...

1790
02:07:04,521 --> 02:07:06,614
now boarding, track number three.

1791
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:10,126
- Fullerton, San Bernardino, Barstow...
- Ray.

1792
02:07:10,193 --> 02:07:14,493
Las Vegas, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Omaha, Chicago.

1793
02:07:21,004 --> 02:07:22,437
- Hello, Charlie.
- Dr. Bruner.

1794
02:07:22,506 --> 02:07:23,768
Hello, Raymond.

1795
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:26,536
Wouldn't you feel more relaxed
in your favorite Kmart clothes?

1796
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:28,043
Tell him, Ray.

1797
02:07:28,111 --> 02:07:30,170
- Kmart sucks.
- I see.

1798
02:07:30,247 --> 02:07:34,445
I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.

1799
02:07:34,518 --> 02:07:38,079
Why don't you take a couple of minutes?
See you, Charlie.

1800
02:07:39,256 --> 02:07:42,191
You made a joke, Ray.

1801
02:07:46,963 --> 02:07:51,024
I guess I'd better give this to you.
You're gonna have to carry this now.

1802
02:07:52,536 --> 02:07:55,994
It's got your cheeseballs,
your apple juice...

1803
02:07:56,072 --> 02:07:58,040
notebooks, pens and...

1804
02:07:58,108 --> 02:08:00,542
'Who's On First?' video
that you Like.

1805
02:08:00,610 --> 02:08:03,670
- 'Who's On First?' is very funny.
- I told you it's funny.

1806
02:08:03,747 --> 02:08:05,237
Board!

1807
02:08:05,315 --> 02:08:08,409
- Better get goin'.
- Very shiny train.

1808
02:08:08,485 --> 02:08:10,919
Yeah, it sure is.

1809
02:08:10,987 --> 02:08:14,184
Now listen, Ray.
Dr. Bruner only has custody of you.

1810
02:08:14,257 --> 02:08:17,055
That doesn't mean I can't visit.

1811
02:08:17,127 --> 02:08:19,925
I'm comin' to see you in two weeks.

1812
02:08:19,996 --> 02:08:22,829
- How many days is that?
- Fourteen days from today.

1813
02:08:22,899 --> 02:08:24,833
- Today's Wednesday.
- And hours?

1814
02:08:25,969 --> 02:08:27,596
336 hours.

1815
02:08:27,671 --> 02:08:29,070
Mystifying.

1816
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:32,638
'Course, that's 20,160 minutes.

1817
02:08:32,709 --> 02:08:37,612
1,209,600 seconds.

1818
02:08:37,681 --> 02:08:39,114
Ray?

1819
02:08:51,461 --> 02:08:52,894
I'll see you soon.

1820
02:08:52,963 --> 02:08:55,557
Yeah.
One for bad, two for good.

1821
02:08:59,703 --> 02:09:01,136
Bet two for good.

1822
02:09:13,316 --> 02:09:15,250
Three minutes to Wapner.

1823
02:09:16,887 --> 02:09:18,445
You'll make it.
