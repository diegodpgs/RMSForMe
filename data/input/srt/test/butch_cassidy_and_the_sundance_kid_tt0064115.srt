1
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:34,123
- Good night, Pat.
- Good night.

2
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:41,445
- What happened? Old bank was beautiful.
- People kept robbing it.

3
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,922
It's a small price to pay for beauty.

4
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,764
Hit me.

5
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:56,850
Again.

6
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,652
Bust!

7
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:04,884
Give me credit, Mr. Macon?

8
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:06,964
You know my rules, Tom.

9
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,730
Well, looks like you just about
cleaned everybody out, fella.

10
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,566
You haven't lost a hand
since you got the deal.

11
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:17,682
What's the secret of your success?

12
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,644
Prayer.

13
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,124
Let's just you and me play.

14
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:43,484
Hit it.

15
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:49,044
Bust!

16
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:54,046
Yeah. You're a hell of a card player, fella.

17
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:57,367
I know, cos I'm a hell of a card player.

18
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:01,611
And I can't even spot how you're cheatin'.

19
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:16,808
The money stays and you go.

20
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:24,286
Well, we seem to be a little short
on brotherly love around here.

21
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:27,968
- If you're with him, you better get out of here.
- We're on our way.

22
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,046
- Come on.
- I wasn't cheating.

23
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:31,361
- Come on!
- I wasn't!

24
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:35,366
You can die.
For that matter, you can both die.

25
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:37,808
- Hear that?
- If he invites us to stay, we'll go.

26
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:42,011
- We were gonna leave anyway.
- He's gotta invite us to stick around.

27
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:46,762
He'll draw on you. He's ready.
You don't know how fast he is.

28
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:58,805
- I'm over the hill, but it can happen to you.
- That's just what I wanna hear(!)

29
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:01,691
Every day you get older. Now, that's a law.

30
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:15,290
What would you think about
maybe asking us to stick around?

31
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,603
- What?
- You don't have to mean it.

32
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:20,446
Just ask us to stick around. I promise you...

33
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:30,168
I can't help you, Sundance.

34
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:44,724
I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid
when I said you were cheatin'.

35
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:50,565
If I draw on you, you'll kill me.

36
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:53,167
There's that possibility.

37
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:57,724
No. You'd be killin' yourself. So why
don't you just invite us to stick around?

38
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,010
Now, you can do it.

39
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:04,288
And easy. Come on.

40
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:08,604
Come on.

41
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:12,924
Why don't you stick around?

42
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,607
Thanks, but we gotta get goin'.

43
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:23,571
Hey, Kid.

44
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:25,848
Hey, Kid! How good are ya?

45
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:39,367
Like I been tellin' you, over the hill.

46
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:39,773
Boy, every time I see Hole in the Wall again,
it's like seein' it fresh for the first time.

47
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:43,642
And every time that happens
I keep askin' myself the same question.

48
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:47,124
How can I be so damn stupid
as to keep comin' back here?

49
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:55,092
- What's your idea this time?
- Bolivia.

50
00:09:57,494 --> 00:10:01,407
- What's Bolivia?
- Bolivia. That's a country, stupid.

51
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:04,372
In Central or South America. One or the other.

52
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,570
Why don't we just go to Mexico instead?

53
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:11,169
Cos all they got in Mexico is sweat.
There's too much of that here.

54
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:14,769
If we'd been in business in the California
gold rush, where'd we have gone?

55
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:16,446
- California, right?
- Right.

56
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:19,446
So when I say Bolivia,
you just think California.

57
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:26,326
You wouldn't believe what they're
findin' in the ground down there.

58
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:28,882
Silver mines, gold mines, tin mines.

59
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:32,444
Payrolls so heavy
we'd strain ourselves stealin' 'em.

60
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:38,209
You just keep thinkin', Butch.
That's what you're good at!

61
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:42,048
Boy, I got vision and
the rest of the world wears bifocals.

62
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:05,404
Hi, News. Whatcha doin'?

63
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:08,566
Oh, howdy, Butch. Nothin'.

64
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:10,292
Nothin'.

65
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:11,773
Howdy, Sundance.

66
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:15,125
Well, you sure are.
You're doin' somethin'. What?

67
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:22,527
Just fixin' to rob the Union Pacific Flyer,
Butch. That's all we had in mind.

68
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,807
You fellas got everything I told you all wrong.

69
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:29,482
True, we might hit the Flyer,

70
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:33,283
but even if we do, it won't be this run.
It'll be the next one - the return.

71
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:37,003
- Sundance and me been checking the banks.
- No banks.

72
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:38,891
What?

73
00:11:39,654 --> 00:11:42,043
The Flyer, Butch.

74
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:46,251
Fellas, bad as they are,
banks are better than trains.

75
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,963
They don't move. They stay put.
You know the money's in there.

76
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:53,285
- When I left I gave orders.
- New orders been given.

77
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:55,365
Well, I run things here, Harvey.

78
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,970
Used to you did.

79
00:11:58,054 --> 00:12:00,045
Me now.

80
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,125
This don't concern you!

81
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:09,088
- You tell him to stay out.
- Well, he goes his own way like always.

82
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:13,014
What's the matter with you guys?

83
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:15,654
When I came here, you weren't even a gang.
I formed ya!

84
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,123
- Who says?
- Well, read 'em a clippin', News.

85
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:20,409
- Which one?
- Any of 'em!

86
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:28,092
This one here's from the <i>Salt Lake Herald,</i>

87
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:33,726
- "Butch Cassidy's Hole in the Wall Gang..."
- Butch Cassidy's gang - that's me!

88
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:37,727
You want Harvey to do your plannin'?
To do your thinkin'? To run things?

89
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:40,453
- "...outlaws with them on..."
- Shut up now, News!

90
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,570
Not till I get to the good part, Butch.

91
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:47,808
"Known to have participated in the hold-up
are Flat Nose Curry and News Carver."

92
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:51,364
I just love to read my name
in the paper, Butch.

93
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:54,288
OK, so we forget about
Logan takin' over. OK, Flat Nose?

94
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,889
You always said any one of us
could challenge you.

95
00:12:56,975 --> 00:13:01,605
- It's cos I figured no one would do it.
- Figured wrong, Butch.

96
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,644
You guys can't want Logan!

97
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:09,529
At least he's with us, Butch.
You've been spendin' a lot of time gone.

98
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:11,970
- Cos everything's different.
- Guns or knives?

99
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:16,765
- It's harder now. You gotta plan more.
- Guns or knives?!

100
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,367
- Neither.
- Pick!

101
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:21,844
I don't wanna shoot with you, Harvey.

102
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:25,090
Anything you say, Butch.

103
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:43,213
Maybe there's a way to make a profit in this.

104
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:46,611
Bet on Logan.

105
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:49,732
- I would, but who'd bet on you?
- Sundance,

106
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:55,691
when we're done, if he's dead,
you're welcome to stay.

107
00:13:56,695 --> 00:14:01,644
Listen, I don't mean to be a sore loser,
but when it's done, if I'm dead, kill him.

108
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,726
Love to.

109
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,769
No, no, not yet. Not until me and Harvey
get the rules straightened out.

110
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,653
Rules? In a knife fight? No rules!

111
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:24,526
If there ain't no rules, let's start.
Someone count 1, 2, 3, go.

112
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,606
1, 2, 3, go!

113
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:32,009
I was really rootin' for you, Butch.

114
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:33,972
Well, thank you, Flat Nose.

115
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:37,767
That's what sustained me
in my time of trouble.

116
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,843
Hey, what's this about the Flyer?

117
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:44,574
Harvey said we'd hit it
both this run and the return.

118
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:48,648
Nobody's done that to the Flyer before.
No matter how much we got the first time,

119
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:52,694
they'd figure the return was safe
and load it up with money.

120
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:55,573
- Harvey thought of that?!
- Yes, sir. He did.

121
00:14:56,895 --> 00:15:00,285
Well, I'll tell you somethin'.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

122
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,410
- Stop it!
- Where?

123
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,812
Up ahead there.

124
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:43,889
Bet that's old Butch himself!

125
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:52,406
Hold it there.

126
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:56,843
- I just thought I'd watch.
- Bring the kids, why don't you?

127
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,926
Stick your heads in.

128
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:02,373
You'll get yourself blown up,
you don't open that door.

129
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:07,006
I can't do that on account of I work for
EH Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad...

130
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,928
Shut up about that EH Harriman stuff
and open the door!

131
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:12,483
- What's goin' on?
- We got a patriot in there.

132
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:16,409
- OK, go ahead, News.
- That's Woodcock. He's awful dedicated.

133
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:18,486
- Woodcock!
- Yes, sir.

134
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:21,048
You know who we are?

135
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:24,332
You're the Hole in the Wall Gang,
Mr. Cassidy. I understand.

136
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:28,647
But you gotta understand Mr. EH Harriman
himself of the Union Pacific give me this job.

137
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:33,650
- I've gotta do my best, don't you see?
- That don't include gettin' yourself killed!

138
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:36,932
- Dynamite's ready.
- Mr. EH Harriman had the confidence...

139
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:42,533
Open the door or that's it! Do you think EH
Harriman would get himself killed for you?

140
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,173
Woodcock?

141
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:49,375
I work for Mr. EH Harriman of the Union
Pacific Railroad, and he entrusted me...

142
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:07,735
Hey, Woodcock.
Hey, Woodcock, you all right?

143
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,534
Hey.

144
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:18,568
Whatever Harriman's payin' you ain't enough.

145
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,973
There ain't what I'd call
a fortune in there, Butch.

146
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,446
Well, just so we come out ahead.
That's the main thing.

147
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:39,452
The Hole in the Wall Gang, I guess you
heard, robbed the Flyer outside our town,

148
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:44,326
so that makes it our responsibility
to get out there and get after them.

149
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,374
Now, you're gonna have
to bring your own horses.

150
00:17:47,456 --> 00:17:49,970
How many of you can bring your own guns?

151
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:57,967
Yeah, well, how many of you are going
to want me to supply you with guns?

152
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:05,973
Well... Come on, now. I think it's
up to us to do something, don't you?

153
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:09,173
Why? They're probably halfway
to Hole in the Wall already.

154
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,248
That's just exactly why we have got to hurry.

155
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:16,329
If we get mounted up right now and
get after them, maybe we could head 'em off.

156
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,374
Head 'em off? You crazy?
We did that, they'd kill us.

157
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:23,972
Well, I don't think we want to lie down
and just let them get away with this...

158
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:28,445
Boy, I just eat this up with a spoon!

159
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:31,969
All right, you two. I want you at my party.

160
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:35,048
- What party?
- I'm losing my piano player.

161
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:37,286
He's going off to fight the war.

162
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:39,731
- What war?
- The war with the Spanish.

163
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:41,807
"Remember the <i>Maine,"</i>

164
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:46,729
- Who can forget it?
- I'm giving him a sendoff, so come on.

165
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:59,925
# Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you...

166
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:03,611
When I was a kid, I always thought
I was gonna grow up to be a hero.

167
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:08,486
- Well, it's too late now.
- What'd you say that for? You didn't have to.

168
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:11,648
You want me to go, I'll go all alone

169
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:15,809
and fight the Hole in the Wall Gang.
Hell, that's fine with me.

170
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:20,333
And you want your kids to know that
you let me do that, that's fine with me!

171
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:23,005
But I don't think that's what you want.

172
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,051
Is it?

173
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,408
Why don't <i>we</i> enlist? Go fight the Spanish.

174
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,612
You and me in the war.

175
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:39,848
We got a lot of things goin' for us.
Experience, maturity, leadership.

176
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:42,006
I bet we end up officers.

177
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:44,087
I'd be Major Parker.

178
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:47,247
Parker?

179
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:49,327
Yeah, that's my real name.

180
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:53,444
- Robert LeRoy Parker.
- No foolin'?

181
00:19:54,136 --> 00:19:56,127
Yeah.

182
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,725
- Mine's Longbaugh.
- No foolin'?

183
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:06,052
- Long what?
- Harry Longbaugh.

184
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:08,730
So you'd be Major Longbaugh.
Whaddaya say?

185
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:16,807
You just keep thinkin', Butch.
That's what you're good at!

186
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:23,452
But you're not frantic! No, sir! You have got
respect for me and I have got respect for you!

187
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:27,848
That is why I'm your marshal! And that is
why <i>you</i> and <i>you</i> and <i>you</i> are riding with me!

188
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,166
Am I right?

189
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:32,686
Well? Whaddaya say?

190
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:35,286
I say this:

191
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:39,289
I say, ladies and gentlemen,

192
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:42,049
boys and girls, friends and enemies,

193
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:44,696
- meet the future!
- The future what?

194
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,734
The future mode of transportation
for this western world.

195
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:51,935
Now, I'm not gonna make a lot of
extravagant claims for this little machine.

196
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:55,895
Sure, it'll change your whole life
for the better, but that's all!

197
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,967
What do you think you're doin'?

198
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,366
You got the crowd together.
Just thought I'd do a little selling.

199
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:05,005
- I'm trying to raise a posse here!
- Got a short presentation.

200
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:08,247
The horse is dead!
You'll see this item sells itself.

201
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:11,453
Are you going to listen to him,
or come with me?

202
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,768
Butch, Fanny says for you
to come in to her party, right now.

203
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:20,648
Cheaper than a horse to keep.
No oats, no mess, no kicks, no runnin' away...

204
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,534
Well,

205
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:27,416
I think I'll get saddled up
and go lookin' for a woman.

206
00:21:28,617 --> 00:21:30,608
Good huntin'.

207
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,417
Shouldn't take more than a couple of days.

208
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:40,808
I'm not picky.

209
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:44,369
As long as she's smart, pretty...

210
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,408
and sweet.

211
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:51,128
And gentle and... tender and...

212
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:54,127
refined and

213
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:57,254
lovely and... carefree...

214
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:04,854
Keep goin', teacher lady.

215
00:23:12,217 --> 00:23:14,685
It's OK. Don't mind me. Keep on goin'.

216
00:23:41,217 --> 00:23:43,208
Let down your hair.

217
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:56,726
Shake your head.

218
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:04,414
- Know what I wish?
- What?

219
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:06,886
That once you'd get here on time!

220
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:13,011
You are mine, Etta Place.

221
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:14,974
Mine!

222
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:16,570
You hear me?

223
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:19,808
Mine! All mine!

224
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:26,330
Your soft, white flesh is mine.

225
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:28,136
Soft.

226
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:29,697
White.

227
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,329
Meet the future!

228
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:43,412
- Do you know what you're doin'?
- Theoretically.

229
00:25:44,178 --> 00:25:47,250
# Don't ever hit your mother with a shovel

230
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:50,091
# It leaves a dull impression on her mind!

231
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:57,574
# <i>Raindrops keep fallin' on my head</i>

232
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:03,212
# <i>And just like the guy</i>
<i>whose feet are too big for his bed</i>

233
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:06,256
# <i>Nothin' seems to fit, those</i>

234
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:10,854
# <i>Raindrops are fallin' on my head,</i>
<i>they keep fallin'</i>

235
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:15,489
# <i>So I just did me some talkin' to the sun</i>

236
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:21,738
# <i>And I said I didn’t like</i>
<i>the way he got things done</i>

237
00:26:21,818 --> 00:26:24,935
# <i>Sleepin' on the job, those</i>

238
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:29,614
# <i>Raindrops are fallin' on my head,</i>
<i>they keep fallin'</i>

239
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:34,897
# <i>But there’s one thing I know</i>

240
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:38,607
# <i>The blues they send to meet me</i>

241
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:41,610
# <i>Won’t defeat me</i>

242
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:48,490
# <i>It won’t be long</i>
<i>till happiness steps up to greet me</i>

243
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:55,376
# <i>Raindrops keep fallin' on my head</i>

244
00:26:56,458 --> 00:27:01,691
# <i>But that doesn’t mean</i>
<i>my eyes will soon be turnin' red</i>

245
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:04,895
# <i>Crying's not for me, cos</i>

246
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:08,971
# <i>l'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin"</i>

247
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:13,048
# <i>Because I’m free</i>

248
00:27:13,858 --> 00:27:16,088
# <i>Nothing’s worryin' me</i>

249
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:28,134
# <i>Raindrops are fallin' on my head</i>

250
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:34,451
# <i>But that doesn’t mean</i>
<i>my eyes will soon be turnin’ red</i>

251
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:37,735
# <i>Crying’s not for me, cos</i>

252
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:42,050
# <i>I’m never gonna stop the rain by complainin"</i>

253
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:46,936
# <i>Because I’m free</i>

254
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:50,415
# <i>Nothing’s worryin'</i>

255
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:53,376
# <i>Me</i>

256
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:58,216
You've come to get him for the Flyer?

257
00:28:58,298 --> 00:29:01,131
Can you believe I'm broke already?

258
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:05,257
- Why is there never any money, Butch?
- Hell, I swear, Etta, I don't know.

259
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:08,774
I've been workin' like a dog all my life
and I can't get a penny ahead.

260
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:13,170
Sundance says it's cos you're a soft touch,
always taking expensive vacations,

261
00:29:13,258 --> 00:29:16,568
buying drinks for everyone,
and you're a rotten gambler.

262
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:19,650
Well, that might have somethin' to do with it!

263
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:35,770
Butch?

264
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:40,014
D'you ever wonder if I'd met you first,
we'd been the ones to get involved?

265
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:42,897
We are involved, Etta. Don't you know that?

266
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:50,376
You're riding on my bicycle. In some Arabian
countries that's the same as being married.

267
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,410
Hey.

268
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,897
- What're you doin'?
- Stealin' your woman.

269
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,254
Take her. Take her.

270
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,697
You're a romantic bastard. I'll give you that.

271
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:23,530
- OK, open up in there.
- I work for Mr. EH Harriman of the Union...

272
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:26,053
- Hey, Woodcock!
- Butch?

273
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:29,415
- You OK?
- Well, sort of.

274
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:32,491
Hey, that's wonderful. Let's take a look at ya.

275
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:39,850
Now, Butch, you gotta have more respect for
me than to think I'd fall for a stunt like that.

276
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:47,849
- You can't wanna get blown up again?
- Butch, you know that if it were my money,

277
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:51,136
there is nobody that I would
rather have steal it than you.

278
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:56,168
But I am still in the employ of Mr.
EH Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad.

279
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:58,454
- Start this train!
- Get back inside, lady.

280
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:02,054
Oh, I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of anything.

281
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:05,290
I'm a grandmother and a female,
and I've got my rights.

282
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:08,974
- We've got no time for this.
- You can bull all the others, but not me!

283
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:12,688
I've fought whisky and gamblin'!
I can certainly fight you!

284
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,292
We got no time for this!

285
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:16,934
- Put down the gun, Sundance.
- Let go!

286
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:20,216
- What you gonna do to her?
- Whatever you force me to.

287
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:23,974
Leave her alone. You're after the money,
and the money's in here.

288
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:28,257
All I want is for somebody
to start this train. Somebody! Please!

289
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:33,208
- Open up or tell her goodbye!
- Our Father, who art in heaven,

290
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,529
hallowed be thy name.

291
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:39,089
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

292
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,739
on earth, as it is in heaven.

293
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:44,617
What am I gonna tell poor Mr. Harriman?

294
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,816
Woodcock, what d'you
have to do somethin' like that for?

295
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:55,051
Well, Butch, you blew the last one so easy
I just had to do something.

296
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,130
Give me that, and get some more.

297
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:00,531
A lot more!

298
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,616
Well, that oughta do it.

299
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:26,770
Think you used
enough dynamite there, Butch?

300
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,657
What the hell is that?

301
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:46,129
Whatever they're sellin', I don't want it.

302
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,650
Will you leave it!

303
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,051
Come on!

304
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,451
- Hey, Butch.
- What?

305
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,132
They're very good.

306
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,611
Split up!

307
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,455
- How many of 'em are followin' us?
- All of them.

308
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,692
All of 'em?
What's the matter with <i>those</i> guys?!

309
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,731
I think we lost 'em. D'you think we lost 'em?

310
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,934
- No.
- Neither do I.

311
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,213
Take our horses and keep 'em out of sight.

312
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,053
- Where's Sweetface?
- Just inside. Trouble?

313
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,858
Listen, you dirty old man, I know you're
a lyin' thief, but who'd know it to look at ya?

314
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,250
Get out front fast. You seen us
ride through town five minutes ago.

315
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,377
You do this right,
I'll get you an old dog to kick.

316
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,489
Here, room nine. The top of the stairs.

317
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,894
# My beloved's proud

318
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,535
Hey, you're drivin' me crazy
starin' out the window like that.

319
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,180
I swear to you Sweetface can handle it easy.

320
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,650
He wouldn't dare louse me up,
he's that scared of me.

321
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,933
How can I give Agnes the concentration she
deserves with you lookin' out the window?

322
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,012
Butch, you're really somethin',
you know that?

323
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,968
Could you be a bit more specific, Agnes?

324
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,051
Butch!

325
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,774
OK, Sweetface, give 'em a nice smile.

326
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,531
Come on.

327
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,253
Oh, that's a nice touch.

328
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:03,369
You know, I swear, if he told <i>me</i> I rode
out of town ten minutes ago, I'd believe him.

329
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,532
And there they go.

330
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:18,293
No, no, no. Don't ask me to stay.

331
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:29,776
You're the only real man I ever met.
You know that, Butch?

332
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:34,779
It's not just cos of all that money
you got to spend on people.

333
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:38,900
It's you. The way you're always
lookin' to see am I happy or not.

334
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:42,772
A lot of the other girls,
they might want you just for

335
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:45,739
when you got lots of money
to spend on people.

336
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:47,493
Me, I...

337
00:38:47,581 --> 00:38:55,135
I don't care about clothes
and money and jewels and furs.

338
00:38:57,021 --> 00:39:02,220
Things like that.
Lots of the other girls do, but I never did.

339
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:04,292
I always said "Agnes..."

340
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:24,058
Don't move!

341
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:26,576
Stand up. Put your hands up.

342
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:29,298
Higher!

343
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:32,772
Now turn around and...

344
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,855
Get our horses and come on back here.

345
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:50,499
Get outta here. Get outta here.

346
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:52,652
Get out!

347
00:39:55,021 --> 00:39:58,457
Go on! Get outta here, you fatheaded beast!

348
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:03,457
- Come on!
- You're the fatheaded beast. Quit shouting.

349
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:06,970
Boy, somebody sure trained 'em.

350
00:40:34,581 --> 00:40:36,060
Which way?

351
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:39,975
It doesn't matter. I don't know
where we've been and I've just been there.

352
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:42,495
They can't follow us. We're safe.

353
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:44,658
You really think so?

354
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:47,130
I will if you will.

355
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:17,139
How long you figure we been watchin'?

356
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,732
Oh, a while.

357
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:34,978
How long before
you figure they're not after us?

358
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:37,052
A while longer.

359
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:41,770
How come you're so talkative?

360
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:45,570
Just naturally blabby, I guess.

361
00:41:49,421 --> 00:41:52,060
I haven't done so much ridin'
since I quit rustlin'.

362
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:56,737
That's a miserable occupation.
Dusk to dawn, no sleep, rotten food.

363
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:02,618
Hey?

364
00:42:03,341 --> 00:42:05,332
I see it.

365
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,097
Torches, you think?

366
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:13,252
Maybe. Maybe lanterns.

367
00:42:14,862 --> 00:42:16,853
They're followin' our path.

368
00:42:18,142 --> 00:42:20,258
Dead on it.

369
00:42:20,342 --> 00:42:24,176
I couldn't do that. Could you do that?
How can <i>they</i> do that?!

370
00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:27,773
Who are those guys?

371
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:41,212
- Sure it'll work?
- It'll work.

372
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:44,931
- That's what you said about Sweetface!
- This'll work.

373
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:12,695
Once they divide up,
we take 'em. No trouble. Right?

374
00:43:13,182 --> 00:43:15,013
Maybe.

375
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:18,333
Boy, for a gunman,
you're one hell of a pessimist.

376
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:22,579
They ought to get to
where we split up any time.

377
00:43:24,862 --> 00:43:27,251
They're just about there.

378
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:32,536
How many of 'em you think'll come our way?

379
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:36,774
I wish we had rifles. I mean, they got rifles.

380
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:39,456
But we got surprise on our side, right?

381
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:48,014
Well, so far they're doin' what we want.

382
00:43:51,582 --> 00:43:54,380
You think we ought to take 'em from up here?

383
00:43:59,422 --> 00:44:01,890
Kid... look, you know this work
better than I do.

384
00:44:01,982 --> 00:44:06,021
Is it best here or maybe
down there, closer to the trail?

385
00:44:11,822 --> 00:44:13,813
Dammit!

386
00:44:15,662 --> 00:44:17,812
They're not goin' for it.

387
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:22,657
Who are those guys?

388
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:25,293
I don't know.

389
00:44:25,902 --> 00:44:28,496
- I don't know!
- We gotta do somethin' and shake 'em.

390
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:34,134
Whatever it is that you come up with is fine
with me. But whatever it is, it better be now!

391
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,581
- Ray...
- What're you doin'?

392
00:44:46,662 --> 00:44:50,177
- Hold on. Easy, Ray.
- What the hell do you mean, take it easy?!

393
00:44:50,262 --> 00:44:53,811
- You said you'd never come to my territory.
- We haven't, Ray. We haven't!

394
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:56,814
Just cos we were friendly
doesn't allow you to break in.

395
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,700
What would happen to me
if we was to be seen together?

396
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:02,171
I'm too old to hunt up another job!

397
00:45:03,502 --> 00:45:05,811
You could at least have drawn your guns!

398
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:08,541
Listen to Butch.
He's tryin' to tell you somethin'.

399
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,738
All right. What do you want?

400
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:13,939
A couple of things. We wanna enlist, Ray.

401
00:45:14,022 --> 00:45:17,651
You know, in the army. Right away!
Go fight the Spanish.

402
00:45:22,582 --> 00:45:25,096
Oh, you're crazy. You are crazy.

403
00:45:25,942 --> 00:45:28,536
You are both of you crazy!

404
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:31,819
They'd throw you in jail
for a thousand years each!

405
00:45:36,662 --> 00:45:39,460
Come on, Sundance. Start trussin' my feet.

406
00:45:42,182 --> 00:45:46,653
Here, you've seen these before. Come on! I'm
not gonna take the chance someone saw you.

407
00:45:46,742 --> 00:45:48,733
Ray, we're serious about this.

408
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:51,290
- You are known outlaws.
- We quit.

409
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,771
- Quit!
- That's the point, we would. Too tight?

410
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:57,821
No, that's all right. There's hankies
in the top drawer you can use to gag me.

411
00:45:57,902 --> 00:46:00,541
Oh, this'd work. This'd work, Ray.

412
00:46:00,622 --> 00:46:05,377
You trust us and the government trusts you,
so anything you tell 'em, they gotta believe it.

413
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:09,819
You've never done a dishonest thing in your
life and what are you, pushin' 60? We'd quit.

414
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:12,939
They'd drop all the charges.
We'd fight till the war is over.

415
00:46:13,022 --> 00:46:17,220
- They don't even have to make us officers.
- That's some proposition.

416
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:20,978
I mean, <i>they</i> forget all about
the years of thievin' and robbin'?

417
00:46:21,063 --> 00:46:25,375
They take you into the army,
which is what you want in the first place.

418
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:30,653
There's somethin' out there
that scares you, huh?

419
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:37,302
It's too late. Shoulda let yourselves get killed
a long time ago while you had the chance.

420
00:46:37,383 --> 00:46:43,413
See, you may be the biggest thing ever hit
this area, but you're still two-bit outlaws!

421
00:46:43,503 --> 00:46:46,893
I never met a soul more affable than you,
or faster than the Kid,

422
00:46:46,983 --> 00:46:52,694
but you're still nothin' but two-bit outlaws
on the dodge. It's over! Don't you get that?

423
00:46:52,783 --> 00:46:58,813
Your times is over and you're gonna die
bloody! And all you can do is choose where.

424
00:46:59,623 --> 00:47:02,217
I'm sorry. I'm gettin' mean in my old age.

425
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:04,854
Come on! Shut me up, Sundance.

426
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,420
Ah, you're wastin' your time.

427
00:49:21,743 --> 00:49:25,338
- They can't track us over rock.
- Tell them that.

428
00:49:50,623 --> 00:49:53,012
They're beginnin' to get on my nerves.

429
00:49:54,543 --> 00:49:56,534
Who are those guys?

430
00:49:58,423 --> 00:50:03,133
You remember the time you and me and Etta
went to Denver that summer for a vacation?

431
00:50:03,223 --> 00:50:07,057
Glad you brought that up.
An important topic, considerin' our situation.

432
00:50:07,143 --> 00:50:10,533
- The night we went gamblin'. Remember?
- We had dinner at the hotel.

433
00:50:10,623 --> 00:50:16,061
Etta had roast beef and I had chicken. If I can
remember what you had, I'll die a happy man!

434
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,694
- Look out there.
- What?

435
00:50:19,943 --> 00:50:23,936
We got to talkin' to some gambler that night
and he told us about an Indian.

436
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:28,939
A full-blooded Indian, except he called
himself with an English name. Sir somebody.

437
00:50:29,024 --> 00:50:32,494
- Lord Baltimore?
- That's right. And he could track anybody.

438
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:34,893
Over anything, day or night.

439
00:50:34,984 --> 00:50:36,781
So?

440
00:50:37,664 --> 00:50:39,780
The guy on the ground, I think it's him.

441
00:50:44,984 --> 00:50:48,420
No, Baltimore works out of Oklahoma.
He's strictly an Oklahoma man.

442
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:52,292
I don't know where we are,
but it sure as hell isn't Oklahoma.

443
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:54,375
Ah, it couldn't be him.

444
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,215
It couldn't be him.

445
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:04,215
I guess.

446
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:08,583
Whoever it is, it sure the hell is somebody.

447
00:51:38,624 --> 00:51:42,094
Dammit! Don't they get tired?
Don't they get hungry?

448
00:51:43,064 --> 00:51:45,737
- They gotta be.
- Why don't they slow up?

449
00:51:45,824 --> 00:51:50,295
Hell, they could go faster. At least that'd be
a change. They don't even break formation.

450
00:51:50,384 --> 00:51:52,375
Do something!

451
00:52:25,704 --> 00:52:28,093
- Kid?
- What?

452
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:31,339
Who's the best lawman?

453
00:52:32,424 --> 00:52:36,337
Best? How? You mean toughest,
or easiest to bribe?

454
00:52:36,944 --> 00:52:38,582
Toughest.

455
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:41,456
Joe Lefors.

456
00:52:42,264 --> 00:52:44,255
Gotta be.

457
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:50,894
Lefors never leaves Wyoming. Never.
You know that.

458
00:52:51,944 --> 00:52:54,094
He always wears a white skimmer.

459
00:52:54,184 --> 00:52:58,223
That's how you tell it's Joe Lefors
cos he wears a white straw hat.

460
00:52:59,984 --> 00:53:01,975
Look at that guy out front.

461
00:53:20,944 --> 00:53:23,014
Jeez, who are those guys?

462
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:30,261
Come on!

463
00:53:30,344 --> 00:53:32,335
On your feet, you dumbhead.

464
00:54:14,304 --> 00:54:16,738
Go on! Get outta here! Go on!

465
00:54:18,184 --> 00:54:20,095
What if they don't follow the horse?

466
00:54:20,184 --> 00:54:23,574
You're the brains, Butch.
You'll think of somethin'.

467
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:49,416
Dammit!

468
00:56:02,345 --> 00:56:05,064
The way I figure it, we can either fight or give.

469
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:08,342
- If we give, we go to jail.
- I've been there already.

470
00:56:09,185 --> 00:56:13,019
But if we fight, they can stay
right where they are and starve us out.

471
00:56:13,105 --> 00:56:17,383
Or go for position, shoot us. Might even
get a rock slide started and get us that way.

472
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:19,376
What else can they do?

473
00:56:19,465 --> 00:56:22,138
They could surrender,
but I wouldn't count on that.

474
00:56:23,305 --> 00:56:25,899
They're goin' for position all right.

475
00:56:26,825 --> 00:56:29,020
Better get ready.

476
00:56:31,265 --> 00:56:36,055
Kid, the next time I say let's go someplace
like Bolivia, let's <i>go</i> someplace like Bolivia.

477
00:56:36,145 --> 00:56:37,544
Next time...

478
00:56:39,465 --> 00:56:41,262
Ready?

479
00:56:42,585 --> 00:56:44,576
No, we'll jump.

480
00:56:48,745 --> 00:56:51,862
- Like hell we will.
- No, it'll be OK,

481
00:56:51,945 --> 00:56:54,903
if we're not squished to death.
They'll never follow us.

482
00:56:54,985 --> 00:56:58,375
- How do you know?
- Would you jump if you didn't have to?

483
00:56:58,465 --> 00:57:02,174
- I have to and I'm not gonna.
- Well, we got to, otherwise we're dead.

484
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:04,825
They'll just have to go back
the same way they come.

485
00:57:04,905 --> 00:57:07,214
- Just one clear shot.
- Come on.

486
00:57:07,305 --> 00:57:08,897
- We got to!
- Get away from me.

487
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:10,703
- Why?
- I wanna fight 'em!

488
00:57:10,785 --> 00:57:12,184
- They'll kill us!
- Maybe.

489
00:57:12,265 --> 00:57:14,654
- You wanna die?
- Do you?

490
00:57:15,505 --> 00:57:18,099
All right. I'll jump first.

491
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,982
- No.
- Then you jump first.

492
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:21,737
- No, I said.
- What's the matter?

493
00:57:21,945 --> 00:57:23,936
I can't swim!

494
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:36,615
Why, are you crazy?
The fall will probably kill ya!

495
00:57:59,025 --> 00:58:02,222
- You're drownin' me!
- I can't help it! I can't swim!

496
00:58:02,305 --> 00:58:06,059
- Kid, I'll kill ya! You're choking me!
- I can't swim!

497
00:58:06,145 --> 00:58:09,182
I'm tellin' you, if I drown, I swear I'll kill you!

498
00:58:09,425 --> 00:58:12,542
Never said I was a great swimmer.

499
00:58:17,065 --> 00:58:20,660
You're choking me! You're choking me!

500
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:23,256
You don't have to choke me!

501
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:26,576
Kid, let go of my throat!

502
00:58:53,266 --> 00:58:55,780
The papers said they had you.

503
00:58:56,706 --> 00:59:01,063
- Was it Lefors? Did they say?
- Joe Lefors? I think so.

504
00:59:01,146 --> 00:59:03,706
- And their tracker?
- Tracker?

505
00:59:03,786 --> 00:59:07,495
- Was it Lord Baltimore?
- I think so. The paper's inside.

506
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:16,661
You got enough to feed us?

507
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:18,737
Don't you know I do?

508
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:23,221
- They said you were dead.
- Don't make a big thing out of it.

509
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:28,581
No, make a big thing out of it.

510
00:59:33,626 --> 00:59:35,423
Hey!

511
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:38,575
It was Baltimore and Lefors.

512
00:59:44,106 --> 00:59:45,903
What?

513
00:59:47,106 --> 00:59:48,744
- You know who else?
- Who?

514
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:51,021
- Jeff Car, George Hiatt.
- Hiatt?

515
00:59:51,106 --> 00:59:53,097
TT Kelliher.

516
00:59:56,506 --> 00:59:59,942
Jeez, we lucked out getting away.
You know that?

517
01:00:02,186 --> 01:00:05,576
But why would these guys join up
and take after us, though?

518
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:08,464
Forget it. A bunch like that
won't stay together long.

519
01:00:08,546 --> 01:00:12,095
- They will, if Mr. Harriman has his way.
- Who?

520
01:00:12,186 --> 01:00:17,214
EH Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad.
He resents the way you've picked on him,

521
01:00:17,346 --> 01:00:20,782
so he's outfitted a special train
and hired special employees.

522
01:00:21,386 --> 01:00:23,820
You've spent the last two days
avoiding them.

523
01:00:23,906 --> 01:00:27,819
It's really sort of flattering,
if you wanna think about it that way.

524
01:00:27,906 --> 01:00:32,582
- A setup like that costs more than we took.
- Apparently he can afford it.

525
01:00:35,026 --> 01:00:37,017
That crazy Harriman.

526
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:40,823
That's bad business!

527
01:00:40,906 --> 01:00:45,855
How long d'you think I'd stay in operation
if every time I pulled a job it cost me money?

528
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:51,020
If he'd pay me what he's spendin' to make me
stop robbin' him, I'd stop robbin' him!

529
01:00:53,426 --> 01:00:56,179
You probably inherited every penny you got!

530
01:00:56,866 --> 01:01:00,859
- Inherited guys. What the hell do they know?
- You say they're hired permanent?

531
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,861
No. Just till they kill you.

532
01:01:13,186 --> 01:01:16,223
That means they're still after us, Butch.

533
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:19,378
And it's gonna be
the same thing all over again.

534
01:01:23,906 --> 01:01:26,898
They'll show up here, sooner or later.

535
01:01:43,186 --> 01:01:45,177
Hey, Etta.

536
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:46,984
I'll get you some more.

537
01:01:47,066 --> 01:01:50,615
Butch and me have been talkin' it all over.

538
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:54,096
Wherever the hell Bolivia is,
that's where we're off to.

539
01:01:54,186 --> 01:01:58,976
Yeah, we'll go down there and play it safe.
Maybe keep our hand in a little bit.

540
01:02:00,386 --> 01:02:03,423
- Butch speaks some Spanish.
- I can wrestle with a menu OK.

541
01:02:03,506 --> 01:02:05,497
And you speak it good.

542
01:02:06,866 --> 01:02:09,255
It'd be good cover goin' with a woman.

543
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,217
No one expects it.

544
01:02:13,426 --> 01:02:15,417
We could travel safer.

545
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:21,336
What I'm sayin' is
if you wanna go, I won't stop you.

546
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:24,498
But the minute you start
to whine or make a nuisance,

547
01:02:24,586 --> 01:02:28,181
I don't care where we are,
I'm dumpin' you flat.

548
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:31,861
Don't sugar-coat it like that, Kid.
Tell her straight.

549
01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:41,939
I'm 26 and I'm single and a schoolteacher,
and that's the bottom of the pit.

550
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:45,575
And the only excitement I've known
is here with me now.

551
01:02:46,466 --> 01:02:51,904
So I'll go with you and I won't whine, and
I'll sew your socks and stitch your wounds,

552
01:02:51,986 --> 01:02:55,376
and I'll do anything you ask of me,
except one thing.

553
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,576
I won't watch you die.

554
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:01,261
I'll miss that scene, if you don't mind.

555
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:36,700
The future's all yours, ya lousy bicycles!

556
01:08:29,508 --> 01:08:31,897
Well, you know, it could be worse.

557
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:36,337
You get a lot more for your money
in Bolivia. I checked on it.

558
01:08:36,428 --> 01:08:40,341
What could they have here
that you could possibly wanna buy?

559
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,938
Jeez, all Bolivia can't look like this.

560
01:08:48,028 --> 01:08:52,340
How do you know? This might be
the garden spot of the whole country.

561
01:08:53,548 --> 01:08:58,986
People may travel hundreds of miles just
to get to this spot where we're standing now.

562
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:02,105
This might be the Atlantic City,
New Jersey of all Bolivia.

563
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:07,706
I know a lot more about Bolivia than you
know about Atlantic City, I can tell you that.

564
01:09:08,588 --> 01:09:10,579
You do, huh?

565
01:09:11,428 --> 01:09:13,225
I was born there.

566
01:09:13,308 --> 01:09:15,299
I was born in New Jersey.

567
01:09:15,988 --> 01:09:19,344
- Brought up there. So...
- You're from the East. I didn't know.

568
01:09:19,428 --> 01:09:22,386
The total tonnage of what
you don't know is enough to...

569
01:09:22,468 --> 01:09:26,143
- I'm not sure we're accomplishing anything.
- Listen!

570
01:09:26,268 --> 01:09:30,386
Your job is to back me up,
because you'd starve without me.

571
01:09:31,148 --> 01:09:33,537
And, you, your job is to shut up!

572
01:09:37,788 --> 01:09:41,906
Well, he'll feel a lot better
after he's robbed a couple of banks.

573
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,339
Bolivia!

574
01:09:57,588 --> 01:10:03,140
Hell, it's just a bank like any other bank.
Gotta move in slowly, check out everything.

575
01:10:04,348 --> 01:10:08,580
- The thing to remember...
- Don't tell me how to rob a bank! I know how!

576
01:10:09,228 --> 01:10:14,427
Boy, a few dark clouds appear on your
horizon, you just go all to pieces, don't you?

577
01:10:34,108 --> 01:10:39,546
<i>Buenos días, señores, ¿Les puedo servir</i>
<i>en algo? Ordenen, por favor, inmediatamente,</i>

578
01:10:41,148 --> 01:10:43,139
<i>¿Quieren hacer algún depósito?</i>

579
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:50,302
<i>Si quieren abrir alguna cuenta, vean al cajero,</i>
<i>Inmediatamente los atendemos,</i>

580
01:10:56,508 --> 01:10:58,305
<i>¿Señor?</i>

581
01:11:08,828 --> 01:11:10,898
<i>Adiós,</i>

582
01:11:11,108 --> 01:11:12,860
This is a robbery.

583
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:15,143
<i>Esto es un robo,</i>

584
01:11:16,108 --> 01:11:18,099
<i>Esto es un robo,</i>

585
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,940
This is a unison recitation.

586
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:29,021
I'm not doing this.
He claimed he knew the damn language!

587
01:11:29,109 --> 01:11:33,944
We've been over this before. Your line
of work requires a specialized vocabulary.

588
01:11:34,029 --> 01:11:37,658
- I got nervous. I forgot the words. Shoot me!
- You've had worse ideas lately!

589
01:11:37,949 --> 01:11:39,940
Raise your hands.

590
01:11:42,189 --> 01:11:43,668
<i>Las manos arriba,</i>

591
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:45,740
Raise them.

592
01:11:46,629 --> 01:11:48,506
<i>Arriba,</i>

593
01:11:48,589 --> 01:11:50,659
All of you, back against the wall.

594
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:53,180
<i>Todos ustedes,</i>

595
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,946
and then... <i>"arrísmense" a la pared,</i>

596
01:11:58,629 --> 01:12:00,620
Give me the money.

597
01:12:05,629 --> 01:12:07,779
Give me the money.

598
01:12:08,389 --> 01:12:10,380
Give me the money.

599
01:12:11,749 --> 01:12:15,344
This is not going to work and we'll be up
all night until you get this.

600
01:12:15,429 --> 01:12:17,420
Now, give me the money.

601
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:24,667
It's on the tip of my tongue, Etta. I swear it.

602
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:30,107
Butch, are you still thinking in there?

603
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:32,066
What the hell else is there to do?

604
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:34,626
Try this one.

605
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:36,939
Where is the safe? Open it.

606
01:12:37,589 --> 01:12:39,580
<i>¿Dónde es..?</i>

607
01:12:43,549 --> 01:12:45,540
That's a hard one.

608
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:49,944
<i>¿Dónde está la caja? ¡Ábrala!</i>

609
01:12:50,869 --> 01:12:52,666
That's very good, Butch.

610
01:12:53,629 --> 01:12:55,620
You're a good teacher, Etta.

611
01:12:56,589 --> 01:12:58,864
<i>- ¡Esto es un robo!</i>
<i>- ¿Un robo?</i>

612
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:06,026
<i>Manos a...</i>

613
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:08,858
<i>Manos...</i>

614
01:13:15,509 --> 01:13:18,103
<i>- ¡Manos arriba!</i>
- They got 'em up! Skip on down.

615
01:13:18,309 --> 01:13:19,708
<i>- ¡Arriba!</i>
- Skip on down!

616
01:13:19,789 --> 01:13:25,147
<i>- Todos ustedes "arrísmense" a la pared,</i>
- They're against the wall already!

617
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:28,701
<i>Dónde...</i>
Ah, you're so damn smart, you read it!

618
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:42,183
- Lot of good you did.
- You didn't help.

619
01:13:42,269 --> 01:13:44,703
You ain't any good without a crib sheet.

620
01:13:51,549 --> 01:13:53,540
<i>¡Bandidos!</i>

621
01:14:00,749 --> 01:14:04,105
- For God's sake, don't drop the money!
- I won't!

622
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,783
<i>- Voy a traer al comisario,</i>
<i>- ¡Sí, vamos!</i>

623
01:14:06,869 --> 01:14:08,666
<i>- ¿Su nombre?</i>
<i>- Evaristo,</i>

624
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:10,307
<i>¿Evaristo qué?</i>

625
01:14:10,389 --> 01:14:13,108
<i>Comandante,</i>
<i>dos hombres acaban de asaltar el banco,</i>

626
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:16,340
<i>- ¿Quiénes eran?</i>
<i>- Dos yanquis y una muchacha,</i>

627
01:14:16,429 --> 01:14:18,738
<i>Se llevaron todo el dinero y mi pistola,</i>

628
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:21,627
<i>¡Vamonos! Vengan ustedes, ¡a los caballos!</i>

629
01:15:11,749 --> 01:15:13,341
Isn't that a pretty sight?

630
01:15:16,869 --> 01:15:20,305
We're back in business,
boys and girls, just like the old days.

631
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:38,387
- Jose!
<i>- Sí, señor,</i>

632
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:40,586
We should stay, get him and be done with it.

633
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:44,550
Yeah, but what if we lose? We saw him
with two guys, but what if he's got 20?

634
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:48,146
- You don't know for sure it's Lefors.
- I'm a hell of a guesser.

635
01:19:48,231 --> 01:19:51,541
He can't arrest you here.
It's a foreign country. Or take you back.

636
01:19:51,631 --> 01:19:54,703
He's not gonna take anybody back.
He wants to finish us here.

637
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:57,669
He'll wait for us to pull a job,
then hunt us like before.

638
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:03,189
And if he misses us, he'll wait for the next
job. Let's finish it now, one way or the other.

639
01:20:04,151 --> 01:20:07,461
He's gotta wait for us, right?
To pull another job?

640
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:10,790
Well, what if there isn't another job?

641
01:20:10,871 --> 01:20:14,386
I mean, he can't arrest us
and he can't take us outta here.

642
01:20:14,471 --> 01:20:18,669
We'll drive him crazy.
We'll outlast the bastard. We'll go straight!

643
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:20,742
So you want jobs?

644
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:26,785
You're from the US of A
and you are seeking after employment.

645
01:20:26,871 --> 01:20:32,548
Well, you couldn't have picked a more out of
the way place in all Bolivia, I'll tell you that.

646
01:20:33,551 --> 01:20:35,542
<i>Gracias, Jesús,</i>

647
01:20:35,631 --> 01:20:41,740
Ordinarily, you've got to wait to work
for Percy Garris, but this ain't ordinarily.

648
01:20:41,831 --> 01:20:43,150
Bingo.

649
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:47,543
- You mean there are jobs?
- Yes, there are jobs. There are lots of jobs.

650
01:20:47,631 --> 01:20:49,747
Don't you wanna know why?

651
01:20:49,831 --> 01:20:51,822
Yeah. Why?

652
01:20:51,911 --> 01:20:53,469
Dammy.

653
01:20:53,551 --> 01:20:56,543
Because I cannot promise to pay you.

654
01:20:57,271 --> 01:20:59,660
Don't you wanna know why?

655
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:01,742
OK. Why?

656
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:07,349
On account of the payroll thieves,
fellow citizens.

657
01:21:07,431 --> 01:21:12,221
You see, every mine around
gets its payroll from La Paz.

658
01:21:12,871 --> 01:21:16,261
And every mine around
gets its payroll held up.

659
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:20,661
Some say it's the Bolivian bandits and...

660
01:21:21,551 --> 01:21:25,863
some say that it's the "Bandidos Yanquis".

661
01:21:26,351 --> 01:21:28,342
Could I see that?

662
01:21:33,111 --> 01:21:36,660
Fairly nice-looking piece.
Can you hit anything?

663
01:21:37,511 --> 01:21:39,502
Sometimes.

664
01:21:47,751 --> 01:21:49,742
Hit that.

665
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:59,309
No, no, son. No, son.
I just wanna know can you shoot.

666
01:21:59,391 --> 01:22:01,382
Put your piece in your hand...

667
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:04,542
and shoot.

668
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:17,102
Dammy.

669
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:19,068
Can I move?

670
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:21,904
Move? What the hell you mean move?

671
01:22:27,191 --> 01:22:29,580
- I'm better when I move.
- Yeah.

672
01:22:30,831 --> 01:22:36,383
Well, considering that I'm desperate
and you are just what I'm looking for,

673
01:22:36,471 --> 01:22:40,862
on top of which you stem from the US of A,
we start tomorrow morning.

674
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:43,340
- You mean we got jobs?
- Payroll guard.

675
01:22:43,951 --> 01:22:45,350
Dammy.

676
01:22:45,431 --> 01:22:47,023
<i>¡Vámonos a trabajar!</i>

677
01:22:47,111 --> 01:22:49,261
Hey, Chusto! Chusto!

678
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:53,867
# Oh, don't you remember
sweet Betsy from Pike?

679
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:58,149
# Crossed the high mountains
with her lover, Ike

680
01:22:58,231 --> 01:23:02,019
# Two yoke of oxen and a big yeller dog

681
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:05,660
# A tall Shanghai rooster and one spotted hog

682
01:23:05,751 --> 01:23:09,790
# Toodle-dang hoodie aye-doh,
toodle-dang hoodie ay

683
01:23:09,871 --> 01:23:13,989
# Toodle-dang hoodie aye-doh,
toodle-dang hoodie ay

684
01:23:14,071 --> 01:23:17,666
# The Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died

685
01:23:17,751 --> 01:23:19,742
# Last piece of bacon that morning...

686
01:23:19,831 --> 01:23:22,061
I think they're in the trees up ahead.

687
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:25,143
- In the bushes on the left.
- They're in the trees up ahead!

688
01:23:25,231 --> 01:23:28,064
You take the trees, I'll take the bushes.

689
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:31,029
Will you two beginners cut it out!

690
01:23:31,471 --> 01:23:34,861
Well, we're just trying
to spot an ambush, Mr. Garris.

691
01:23:34,951 --> 01:23:36,669
Morons.

692
01:23:36,751 --> 01:23:39,504
I've got morons on my team.

693
01:23:39,591 --> 01:23:43,106
Nobody is going to rob us
going <i>down</i> the mountain!

694
01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:46,024
We have got no money
going <i>down</i> the mountain!

695
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:50,343
When we have got the money,
on the way back,

696
01:23:50,591 --> 01:23:52,582
then you can sweat.

697
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:54,983
Bingo.

698
01:24:19,152 --> 01:24:21,541
We hit this place in June, didn't we?

699
01:24:33,752 --> 01:24:35,549
Jones!

700
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:37,943
Give me a hand over here.

701
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:40,023
Who am I? Smith or Jones?

702
01:24:40,632 --> 01:24:42,509
Live!

703
01:24:58,592 --> 01:25:01,664
'Bout a half-hour more
and we can start to worry.

704
01:25:02,432 --> 01:25:06,664
As soon as we get to the pass up there.
We'll be all right till then.

705
01:25:07,912 --> 01:25:11,746
- They might try somethin' here.
- Nah. Better cover up there.

706
01:25:13,592 --> 01:25:18,382
You got to relax, you fellas.
You got to get used to Bolivian ways.

707
01:25:18,672 --> 01:25:20,981
You got to go easy. Dammy!

708
01:25:21,472 --> 01:25:22,666
Like I do.

709
01:25:22,752 --> 01:25:26,870
Course, you probably
think I'm crazy, but I'm not.

710
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:29,983
Bingo. I'm colorful.

711
01:25:30,712 --> 01:25:35,388
That's what happens when you live
ten years alone in Bolivia. You get colorful.

712
01:25:54,792 --> 01:25:56,589
Where are they?

713
01:25:58,952 --> 01:26:00,544
I can't see 'em.

714
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,864
Let's get outta here!

715
01:27:45,792 --> 01:27:48,704
Tell them to leave the money and go.

716
01:27:49,752 --> 01:27:53,825
<i>Dejen el "dinoro"... dinero</i> and...

717
01:27:54,432 --> 01:27:56,024
<i>y váyanse,</i>

718
01:27:57,872 --> 01:28:00,432
<i>¿Que dejemos el dinero y nos vayamos?</i>

719
01:28:01,512 --> 01:28:05,267
Tell them we were hired
to take it back. It's our job!

720
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:07,704
Tell them the money isn't ours.

721
01:28:09,313 --> 01:28:12,225
<i>El dinero... no es nuestro,</i>

722
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:16,069
<i>No, ya no es de ustedes,</i>
<i>Ahora es de nosotros,</i>

723
01:28:16,153 --> 01:28:17,950
<i>¡Claro!</i>

724
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:24,622
We'll try telling them again.
It's our job. The money isn't ours.

725
01:28:26,313 --> 01:28:28,952
<i>El dinero no es nuestro,</i>

726
01:28:29,153 --> 01:28:33,226
<i>- Lo necesitamos,</i>
<i>- También nosotros lo necesitamos,</i>

727
01:28:35,193 --> 01:28:37,343
- What do you think?
- Not so good.

728
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:40,222
Can you take the two on the right?

729
01:28:41,193 --> 01:28:46,028
Kid, there's somethin' I think I oughta
tell ya. I never shot anybody before.

730
01:28:49,353 --> 01:28:51,913
One hell of a time to tell me.

731
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:57,303
<i>Vale más que se hagan a un lado,</i>
<i>porque a lo mejor éstos nos matan,</i>

732
01:28:58,033 --> 01:29:03,585
Try for the two on the right. Aim dead center.
That way if you miss, you still hit something.

733
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:05,425
- Go!
<i>- ¿Qué?</i>

734
01:29:05,713 --> 01:29:07,863
- Please!
<i>- ¿Qué?</i>

735
01:29:08,153 --> 01:29:09,905
<i>- Por favor,</i>
<i>- ¡Por favor!</i>

736
01:29:57,713 --> 01:29:59,704
Well, we've gone straight.

737
01:30:02,553 --> 01:30:04,145
What'll we try now.

738
01:30:20,953 --> 01:30:24,468
There are other ways
of going straight, you know.

739
01:30:37,713 --> 01:30:40,227
There are other ways of going straight.

740
01:30:43,153 --> 01:30:45,144
There's farming.

741
01:30:47,633 --> 01:30:49,624
We could buy a place.

742
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:52,704
I don't know how to farm.

743
01:30:56,353 --> 01:30:58,344
What about a ranch, then?

744
01:31:00,513 --> 01:31:05,268
The last time we tried a ranch
was during our rustlin' days.

745
01:31:05,353 --> 01:31:09,790
And even then we weren't much good at it.
It's hard. Hours are brutal.

746
01:31:10,913 --> 01:31:13,427
No, you gotta be a kid to start a ranch.

747
01:31:27,153 --> 01:31:29,030
Hey.

748
01:31:33,953 --> 01:31:36,148
I might go back ahead of you.

749
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:44,864
You mean home?

750
01:31:46,513 --> 01:31:48,504
I was thinking of it.

751
01:31:53,593 --> 01:31:55,584
Whatever you want, Etta.

752
01:31:59,633 --> 01:32:01,624
Maybe I'll go.

753
01:32:10,393 --> 01:32:12,384
Hey.

754
01:32:13,033 --> 01:32:16,151
Etta's thinking of maybe
goin' home ahead of us.

755
01:32:19,754 --> 01:32:21,745
Whatever she wants.

756
01:32:23,954 --> 01:32:25,945
I'll go, then.

757
01:33:01,834 --> 01:33:03,825
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

758
01:33:04,714 --> 01:33:08,992
- How much you got?
- It's hardly worth it. Alpoca Mine.

759
01:33:09,074 --> 01:33:12,828
- I tell you, no more jungle work for me.
- You're gettin' to be an old maid.

760
01:33:12,914 --> 01:33:16,111
Keep your old-maid remarks
to yourself, if you don't mind.

761
01:33:16,194 --> 01:33:19,823
I'll work in the city and mountains,
but from now on jungle work is out!

762
01:33:20,674 --> 01:33:23,234
<i>¿Bandidos Yanquis?</i>

763
01:33:23,314 --> 01:33:25,384
Tell 'em to be quiet.

764
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:27,783
- What's the word?
<i>- Quietos,</i>

765
01:33:27,874 --> 01:33:29,865
<i>¡Quietos!</i>

766
01:33:38,994 --> 01:33:41,792
I tell you, the jungle's
a better cover for payrolls.

767
01:33:41,874 --> 01:33:46,390
Kid, I got a right to my opinion, and
in my opinion there are snakes in the jungle.

768
01:33:46,474 --> 01:33:49,068
I don't work around snakes.

769
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:51,349
What is this place?

770
01:33:51,434 --> 01:33:53,823
I don't know. San vicente, I think.

771
01:33:54,154 --> 01:33:56,588
<i>- ¿Comer?</i>
<i>- Sí, señor, Pasen,</i>

772
01:33:56,674 --> 01:33:59,063
<i>¡Juan! Ven, Llévate los caballos,</i>

773
01:34:24,114 --> 01:34:28,744
I don't enjoy jungles or swamps. I don't like
snakes. I don't much care for night work.

774
01:34:28,834 --> 01:34:30,984
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

775
01:34:32,434 --> 01:34:34,868
<i>¡Capitán! ¡Capitán!</i>

776
01:34:34,954 --> 01:34:37,991
<i>Capitán, allí en la plaza</i>
<i>hay una mula de las minas de Alpoca,</i>

777
01:34:38,074 --> 01:34:40,065
<i>- ¿De las minas de Alpoca?</i>
<i>- Sí, sí,</i>

778
01:34:40,154 --> 01:34:44,306
<i>Allí está, dos hombres la acaban de traer,</i>
<i>están comiendo en el restorán de mi papá,</i>

779
01:34:44,554 --> 01:34:48,547
<i>El guisado está delicioso,</i>
<i>Para chuparse los dedos,</i>

780
01:34:49,514 --> 01:34:52,950
<i>Es la especialidad de la casa,</i>

781
01:34:53,034 --> 01:34:57,869
<i>Se quieren más no tengan pena y díganmelo,</i>
<i>Yo estoy aquí para servirles,</i>

782
01:34:57,954 --> 01:35:01,742
<i>Agradezco la visita</i>
<i>de tan distinguidos caballeros,</i>

783
01:35:01,834 --> 01:35:04,064
<i>Muchas gracias, Para servirles,</i>

784
01:35:04,234 --> 01:35:06,225
<i>- Muchas gracias,</i>
<i>- Sí,</i>

785
01:35:09,474 --> 01:35:12,511
The specialty of the house
and it's still movin'!

786
01:35:20,554 --> 01:35:24,342
Well, that settles it. This place
gets no more of my business.

787
01:35:31,794 --> 01:35:33,466
- Hey.
- What?

788
01:35:33,554 --> 01:35:35,624
What do you think?

789
01:35:35,714 --> 01:35:37,705
I bet it's just one guy.

790
01:35:45,314 --> 01:35:47,703
Don't you get sick of being right all the time?

791
01:36:16,914 --> 01:36:18,905
Reloading.

792
01:36:21,474 --> 01:36:23,465
That's all I got.

793
01:36:27,555 --> 01:36:30,991
We're gonna run out unless
we can get to that mule and get some more.

794
01:36:35,235 --> 01:36:37,226
I'll go.

795
01:36:37,315 --> 01:36:40,307
This is no time for bravery. I'll let you.

796
01:36:41,995 --> 01:36:43,792
Loaded.

797
01:36:50,395 --> 01:36:52,955
Hell! I'm the one that has to go.

798
01:36:54,835 --> 01:36:56,268
Why you?

799
01:36:56,355 --> 01:36:59,745
Cos I could never give you cover.
You can cover me.

800
01:37:02,835 --> 01:37:05,224
You can see I'm right, can't you?

801
01:37:11,155 --> 01:37:15,194
- You go.
- Yeah, why am I always so damned smart?

802
01:37:21,755 --> 01:37:23,746
Here. Gimme your gun.

803
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:32,586
OK. Go!

804
01:37:48,635 --> 01:37:50,671
OK!

805
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:29,752
Go!

806
01:40:09,555 --> 01:40:12,467
Is... is that what you call giving cover?

807
01:40:13,155 --> 01:40:15,350
Is that what you call running?

808
01:40:16,155 --> 01:40:18,749
If I... knew you were gonna stroll...

809
01:40:20,115 --> 01:40:23,505
You never could shoot,
not from the very beginning.

810
01:40:29,075 --> 01:40:31,066
And you are all mouth!

811
01:40:39,156 --> 01:40:41,147
<i>Jefe, ya llegó el ejército,</i>

812
01:40:52,116 --> 01:40:54,107
<i>¡Mi capitán!</i>

813
01:40:54,836 --> 01:40:56,986
<i>- ¿Dónde están?</i>
<i>- Allí en la plaza,</i>

814
01:40:57,076 --> 01:40:59,715
<i>- ¿Cuántos hombres son?</i>
<i>- Dos hombres,</i>

815
01:40:59,796 --> 01:41:01,024
<i>- ¿Dos?</i>
<i>- Mi capitán...</i>

816
01:41:01,116 --> 01:41:03,630
<i>- ¿Dos?</i>
<i>- Bandidos Yanquis,</i>

817
01:41:04,596 --> 01:41:07,190
<i>- Bandidos Yanquis, ¿eh?</i>
<i>- Sí, mi capitán,</i>

818
01:41:08,516 --> 01:41:12,145
<i>¡Sargento Rico! Desmonte a veinte hombres</i>
<i>y que vengan con el teniente,</i>

819
01:41:12,236 --> 01:41:15,751
<i>¡Sargento! Rodeen el zócalo,</i>
<i>y suban hacia la azotea y espérenme,</i>

820
01:41:15,836 --> 01:41:19,226
<i>¡Media vuelta en el lugar! ¡AI frente!</i>

821
01:42:24,796 --> 01:42:28,152
- I got a great idea where we should go next.
- I don't wanna hear it.

822
01:42:28,236 --> 01:42:31,308
- You'll change your mind when I tell ya.
- Shut up!

823
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:33,466
- OK, OK.
- Your great ideas got us here...

824
01:42:33,556 --> 01:42:36,309
- Forget it!
- I never wanna hear another of your ideas.

825
01:42:36,396 --> 01:42:38,387
- All right.
- OK.

826
01:42:47,796 --> 01:42:49,787
Australia.

827
01:42:52,036 --> 01:42:55,915
I figured, secretly
you wanted to know, so I told you.

828
01:42:55,996 --> 01:42:57,987
Australia.

829
01:42:58,836 --> 01:43:03,785
- That's your great idea?
- Oh, boy, it's the latest in... in a long line.

830
01:43:03,876 --> 01:43:06,709
- Australia's no better than here.
- That's all you know.

831
01:43:06,796 --> 01:43:09,913
- Name me one thing...
- They speak English in Australia!

832
01:43:09,996 --> 01:43:13,511
- They do?
- Yeah, smart guy. We wouldn't be foreigners.

833
01:43:16,596 --> 01:43:21,067
They got horses in Australia. Hell, they got
thousands of miles we could hide out in.

834
01:43:21,156 --> 01:43:23,511
Good climate, beaches.
You could learn to swim.

835
01:43:23,596 --> 01:43:26,394
No! Swimming isn't important.

836
01:43:28,756 --> 01:43:30,747
What about the banks?

837
01:43:31,476 --> 01:43:34,070
They're easy. Easy, ripe and luscious.

838
01:43:38,556 --> 01:43:40,387
The banks or the women?

839
01:43:40,476 --> 01:43:43,070
Well, once you got one, you got the other!

840
01:43:46,836 --> 01:43:50,226
- It's a long way though.
- Everything's gotta be perfect with you!

841
01:43:50,316 --> 01:43:53,467
I just don't wanna get there
and find out it stinks, that's all.

842
01:43:53,556 --> 01:43:55,547
At least think about it.

843
01:43:57,476 --> 01:43:59,944
All right.

844
01:44:00,036 --> 01:44:02,027
I'll think about it.

845
01:44:06,076 --> 01:44:07,873
Hey.

846
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:12,431
When we get outside,
when we get to the horses,

847
01:44:12,516 --> 01:44:14,507
just remember one thing.

848
01:44:18,436 --> 01:44:20,631
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

849
01:44:21,236 --> 01:44:23,796
You didn't see Lefors out there, did you?

850
01:44:23,876 --> 01:44:26,106
Lefors?

851
01:44:26,196 --> 01:44:28,232
No.

852
01:44:28,316 --> 01:44:30,193
Oh, good.

853
01:44:30,276 --> 01:44:33,268
For a moment there
I thought we were in trouble.

854
01:44:40,036 --> 01:44:42,834
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

855
01:44:42,916 --> 01:44:45,305
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

856
01:44:46,837 --> 01:44:49,226
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

857
01:45:48,517 --> 01:45:51,714
