1
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:56,312
It's obviously a
major malfunction.

2
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,392
...their President is a
crook. Well, I'm not a crook.

3
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,791
Robert Kennedy was
shot in that ballroom.

4
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:25,549
Thank God Almighty,
we are free at last!

5
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,550
A sniper has fired
at President Kennedy.

6
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:39,908
Or have you ever been a
member of the Communist party?

7
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:46,067
Hi-yo, Silver!

8
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:52,425
...1941...

9
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,186
...a date which
will live in infamy.

10
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:02,257
We bring you the
final edition of

11
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:04,425
our Maxwell House
Good News of 1939.

12
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,414
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. North

13
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:08,184
America, and all
the ships at sea.

14
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:17,263
The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself.

15
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:22,977
CQ...

16
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,255
...this is W-9 GFO.

17
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,655
CQ, this is W-9
GFO here. Come back?

18
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:35,574
CQ...

19
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:38,294
...this is W-9 GFO here.

20
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,294
Come back?

21
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:48,053
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.
Is anybody out there?

22
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:50,133
Not getting anything.

23
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:51,852
Small moves, Ellie.

24
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,533
Small moves.

25
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:00,651
CQ, this is W-9
GFO here. Come back?

26
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,132
Copy, W-9 GFO.

27
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:05,132
K-4 WLD here.

28
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,891
What do I say?

29
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:08,490
Just be yourself.

30
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:11,530
Where are you,
K-4 WLD? Come back?

31
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:12,970
Pensacola. Over.

32
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,730
Pensacola, where's Pensacola?

33
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,449
I'll give you a hint.

34
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,210
Orange juice.

35
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:24,408
Copy that, K-4 WLD. How's the
weather down there in Florida?

36
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,488
Pensacola, Florida.

37
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,889
I have to tell you, Sparks.

38
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,929
1,116 miles.

39
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,487
Pretty good.

40
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:37,247
That's the farthest yet.

41
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,365
Can we hear all
the way to New York?

42
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:52,766
Sure.

43
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,004
Can we hear all the
way to California?

44
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:57,886
I don't see why not.

45
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,524
Can we hear all
the way to Alaska?

46
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,165
On a really clear day.

47
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:04,284
Can we hear all
the way to China?

48
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:07,644
On a really, really clear day.

49
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:11,523
Could we talk to the moon?

50
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:14,843
If it's a big enough
radio, I don't see why not.

51
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,402
Could we talk to Jupiter?

52
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:20,002
Or what's the one after that?

53
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,683
Don't tell me.

54
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,282
I'll give you a hint.

55
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:26,842
Hula-Hoops.

56
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,962
Saturn! Could we
talk to Saturn?

57
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,802
Dad, could we talk to Mom?

58
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:45,320
I don't think even the biggest
radio could reach that far.

59
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,878
All right, no more stalling.

60
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,038
Pensacola!

61
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:06,758
That's a beauty.

62
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:09,557
Now get some sleep.

63
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:18,796
Hey, Dad?

64
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:22,355
Do you think there's
people on other planets?

65
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,156
I don't know, Sparks.

66
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,156
But I guess I'd say...

67
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:29,434
...if it is just us...

68
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:33,115
...it seems like an
awful waste of space.

69
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:54,232
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.

70
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:56,913
Repeat. This is
W-9 GFO. Come back?

71
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,551
I'm going to need
a bigger antenna.

72
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,027
What do you think, Doc Arroway?

73
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:35,666
Isn't she a beauty?

74
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,707
It'll do.

75
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:42,786
The village is five miles away.

76
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:45,175
There's a general
store in the cantina.

77
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:47,306
They can order
anything from San Juan.

78
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:48,945
When can I get dish time?

79
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:50,596
Dr. Clark said you couldn't

80
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:52,584
wait. Your first
shift is tonight.

81
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,498
Go back.

82
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,979
Try back a little bit.
You had something there.

83
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:54,219
There!

84
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:55,337
- Right there?

85
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,618
- You hear it? Right
there, that's it.

86
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,418
All right, 1221.46. That's
well within the L-band.

87
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:02,656
Check off-axis.

88
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:04,736
On it.

89
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:07,816
It's not in the neighborhood.

90
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:18,216
Here it is. J-1741...

91
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:20,095
...+ 2748.

92
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,335
Catalogued November
4, 1982. Pulsar.

93
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:28,894
Must've been the glitch in
the timing's what threw me.

94
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,695
Must've been a starquake.

95
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:33,600
I think it's great that you

96
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,773
listen. Most don't
do that anymore.

97
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:38,654
It's just an old habit.
It makes it feel more real.

98
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:39,733
Ellie.

99
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:41,053
Kent Clark.

100
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:45,374
They said you'd been...

101
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:47,932
...up at Owen's Valley
working under Drumlin.

102
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:49,412
How'd you like him?

103
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,386
That much? About
what I'd expect

104
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:56,452
after what he had
to say about you.

105
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:58,331
And what was that?

106
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,290
That you are brilliant...

107
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,730
...driven...

108
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,491
...a major pain in the ass...

109
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,127
...and obsessed with a field of

110
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:06,570
study he considers
tantamount...

111
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,089
...to professional suicide.

112
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:09,729
Anything else?

113
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,609
Those were the highlights.

114
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,489
Davio, Dr. Vernon. Dr. Arroway.

115
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:18,131
Believe you've already
met our tireless

116
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:19,968
research assistant,
Mr. Fisher...

117
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,847
...as well as his cologne.

118
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,727
Brook's looking at
the black hole in M-87.

119
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:29,568
Eli's studying Markarian
541, a major gamma ray source.

120
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:31,867
Dr. Arroway will
be spending her

121
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:34,327
precious telescope
time listening for...

122
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:36,927
...listening for...

123
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:38,567
Little green men.

124
00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:47,565
One down...

125
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:49,724
...a couple billion to go.

126
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:07,604
Arecibo, right?

127
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:09,843
Does it show?

128
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:13,002
Cracker Jack?

129
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:13,963
No, thanks.

130
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:15,403
Mind if I sit down?

131
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:21,000
I hear the locals, they
call it "El Radar. "

132
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,720
Convinced it has some
dark military purpose.

133
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:25,481
I think we're harmless.

134
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,000
Palmer Joss.

135
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,160
- Ellie Arroway.
- Nice to meet you, Ellie.

136
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,958
What are you studying up there?

137
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,000
The usual.

138
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,838
Nebulae, quasars,
pulsars, stuff like that.

139
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:43,638
What are you writing?

140
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,039
The usual. Nouns, adverbs...

141
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,718
...adjective here and there.

142
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:50,877
I work on a project, SETI.

143
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,559
Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence?

144
00:11:55,638 --> 00:11:57,237
That is out there!

145
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:00,637
Are you a student or something?

146
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:03,157
I'm a writer. I'm
writing a book.

147
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:05,672
I'm here doing
research about how

148
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:08,075
technology affects
Third World cultures.

149
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:10,836
I'm also looking for
this guy, David Drumlin.

150
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:13,145
He's head of the
National Science

151
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:15,075
Foundation. I
want an interview.

152
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,955
I take it you know him?

153
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:20,754
You could say that.

154
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,474
SETI.

155
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:25,275
That's fringe!

156
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,878
I've crossed paths
with him. Something

157
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,913
like that must
really chap his ass.

158
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,753
Compass.

159
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:36,913
That's for you.

160
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:42,992
You better keep this.

161
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:45,751
Might save your life someday.

162
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,871
Have dinner with me tonight?

163
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:57,870
I don't make a good research
subject. I'm not quotable.

164
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,391
No quotes. Scout's honor.

165
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,030
Good meal, good company.

166
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,109
I've got to go.

167
00:13:12,907 --> 00:13:14,629
Drumlin's coming in Tuesday.

168
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:26,387
Now I remember why
I took that desk job.

169
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:29,787
Dr. Drumlin, how are you?

170
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,786
Glad you could make it.

171
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:36,746
If I'd known it took 3 planes,
I might've reconsidered.

172
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:38,226
How is that new office?

173
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,579
Still settling in.
They already want

174
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,905
to give half my
budget to the Pentagon.

175
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,905
Still waiting for E.T. to call?

176
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,384
Good to see you too!

177
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:50,864
Asshole!

178
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:53,223
Looks like it's going
to be a long night.

179
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:55,603
Science must be
accountable to the

180
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:57,903
people paying for
it, the taxpayers.

181
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:01,222
We must stop wasting money on
pie-in-the-sky abstractions...

182
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:04,102
...and spend it on
practical, measurable ways...

183
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:06,862
...to improve the lives of
the people who are paying.

184
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:10,102
Not unlike my L-band,
globular clusters work.

185
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:13,182
You want to do away with
all pure research now?

186
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:16,622
What's wrong with science being
practical? Even profitable?

187
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:18,861
Nothing, as long
as your motive...

188
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:20,972
...is the search
for truth. Which

189
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,860
is what the pursuit
of science is.

190
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,661
That's an interesting
position from a man...

191
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,379
...on a crusade against
the evils of technology...

192
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,740
...Father Joss.

193
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,580
I'm not against technology,
Doctor. I'm against...

194
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,898
...the men who deify it at
the expense of human truth.

195
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:46,057
Kent, I need to have a word
with you. Over here, please.

196
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:54,498
You think that hurt my
chances with that interview?

197
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:56,456
You're a priest?

198
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,417
Not really.

199
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:02,776
I got my Masters in Divinity...

200
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:06,536
...then left the seminary to
do secular humanitarian work...

201
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:09,095
...coordinating
Third World churches.

202
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,775
I couldn't live with
the celibacy thing.

203
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:18,174
You could call me
a man of the cloth...

204
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:20,894
...without the cloth.

205
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,653
You want to get out of here?

206
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:29,414
You see that large W-shaped

207
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:32,213
constellation there?
That's Cassiopeia.

208
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:36,853
And Cassiopeia A gives off
a whole lot of radio signals.

209
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,772
I listen to them a lot.

210
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:41,212
It's a remnant of a supernova.

211
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:44,691
When did you know you
wanted to be an astronomer?

212
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:49,131
When I was about
eight years old...

213
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:51,659
...watching the
sunset, I asked Dad,

214
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,050
"What's that bright
star over there?"

215
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,369
He said that it wasn't
a star. It was...

216
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,529
...a whole planet
called Venus...

217
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,088
...which should
be over there soon.

218
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:14,327
He said, "You know why
they called it Venus?

219
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:17,848
Because they thought it was
so beautiful and glowing.

220
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:19,607
But they didn't know...

221
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,807
...that it's filled with...

222
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:27,246
...deadly gases and
sulfuric acid rain. "

223
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:31,885
Wow, I thought, "This
is it! I'm hooked!"

224
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:37,525
There are four hundred
billion stars out there...

225
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,564
...just in our galaxy alone.

226
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:44,044
If only one out of a million
of those had planets...

227
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:47,444
...if just one out of a
million of those had life...

228
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,692
...and if just one
out of a million

229
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,604
of those had
intelligent life...

230
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,771
...there would be
literally millions

231
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,722
of civilizations out there...

232
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,042
If there wasn't...

233
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:03,003
...it'd be an awful
waste of space.

234
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:09,842
Amen.

235
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,200
So I was lying there,
just looking at the sky.

236
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,839
And then I felt
something. I don't know.

237
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,679
All I know is that
I wasn't alone.

238
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,077
For the first time in my life
I wasn't scared of nothing...

239
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:39,518
...not even dying.

240
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,637
It was God.

241
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,156
And there's no chance that...

242
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,669
...you had this
experience because

243
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,756
some part of you
needed to have it?

244
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,235
I'm a reasonably
intelligent guy, but this...

245
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:06,514
My intellect couldn't
even touch this.

246
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:07,955
No.

247
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,875
I've been to Sunday
school a few times.

248
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:15,834
And?

249
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:20,393
I kept asking all these really
annoying questions like...

250
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,593
..."Where did Mrs.
Cain come from?"

251
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,713
And pretty soon
they asked my dad...

252
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,552
...if he wouldn't mind
keeping me home from now on.

253
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:32,031
Your dad...

254
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:35,152
Is it this guy?

255
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:36,471
Yeah.

256
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:40,431
You're close to
him, aren't you?

257
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:44,711
I was. He died when
I was nine years old.

258
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,710
I never got to know my mother.

259
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,550
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,750
That's got to be tough.

261
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,588
Being alone.

262
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,306
What do you say...

263
00:19:13,547 --> 00:19:16,868
...we pack a picnic tomorrow
and hike up to Mount Arecibo?

264
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:20,586
I don't think I can.
I've got to work.

265
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:25,586
How about dinner tomorrow
night? I know a great dive.

266
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:27,465
No, I don't think so.

267
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:34,024
Ellie, did I miss something?

268
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:37,185
No.

269
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,145
Shit, I'm late!

270
00:19:40,105 --> 00:19:42,864
I told Kent that I'd
be there at 10:30.

271
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:47,144
I'm not trying to push you.

272
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:49,504
I've wanted to look at
this sector for weeks.

273
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:51,302
Just hang out...

274
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,463
...and sleep in. There's
food in the fridge.

275
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:57,143
How can I reach you?

276
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,862
Just leave your
number. I'll call you.

277
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:22,698
Dad!

278
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:27,099
It's starting, you're
going to miss it!

279
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:32,658
Dad, there's another
one! Hurry up!

280
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:35,098
In a minute, Sparks!
I'm almost done.

281
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:37,698
There's another one.
Come on, hurry up, Dad!

282
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:32,213
I'll get the medicine.

283
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:51,283
I know it's hard to
understand this now...

284
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:54,450
...but we aren't
always meant to know

285
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,522
why things happen
the way they do.

286
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,242
Sometimes, we just
have to accept it...

287
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:01,202
...as God's will.

288
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,122
I should have kept medicine
in the downstairs bathroom.

289
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,881
Then I could've
gotten to it sooner.

290
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,957
CQ...

291
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:38,957
...this is W-9
GFO. Do you copy?

292
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,636
Dad, this is Ellie. Come back.

293
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,756
This is Eleanor Arroway...

294
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,875
...transmitting
on 14.2 megahertz.

295
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:00,714
Are you there?

296
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,154
Come back.

297
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:11,994
Are you there?

298
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,833
Dad, this is Ellie.

299
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,869
Hi, Kent. What are
you doing up so early?

300
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:51,230
I was thinking...

301
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:53,988
...we'd make a
pretty good team.

302
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:58,069
We could put together
an ad hoc SETI program.

303
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:00,468
You know the Very Large
Array in New Mexico?

304
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,907
It's a dynamite place
to do SETI work...

305
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:04,826
What are you talking about?

306
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:08,826
Drumlin pulled the plug.

307
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:10,507
We're homeless.

308
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:25,785
It's true, you pulled the plug?

309
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:28,424
You can't see it now,
but I'm doing you a favor.

310
00:25:28,624 --> 00:25:30,572
You're too promising
a scientist to

311
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:32,465
waste your gifts
on this nonsense.

312
00:25:32,704 --> 00:25:34,623
I don't consider
what could be...

313
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,544
...the most important
human discovery nonsense!

314
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,103
400 billion stars...

315
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:42,143
And two probabilities. One,
there's intelligent life...

316
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:44,662
...but too far away to
contact in your lifetime.

317
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:47,183
- And two!
- You're making a decision...

318
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:49,658
There's nothing
but gases and carbon

319
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:51,861
compounds and you're
wasting your time!

320
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:54,902
In the meantime, you
won't be taken seriously.

321
00:25:55,102 --> 00:25:56,701
Your career will be over!

322
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:58,061
So what?

323
00:25:58,341 --> 00:25:59,700
It's my life!

324
00:26:35,897 --> 00:26:38,297
Hey, Kent. You were right.

325
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:40,486
Screw Drumlin.
We'll raise the money

326
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:42,217
ourselves. We'll
go to New Mexico.

327
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:44,656
Chicago's set. Let
me know how it goes.

328
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,694
I've got more corporate stops
on the East Coast for you.

329
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:50,896
Did that investor from
Houston ever get back to us?

330
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:52,975
I'll hit him up
on my way to L.A.

331
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:55,254
Beg for some of
that Hollywood money!

332
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:58,415
They've been making money
off aliens for years.

333
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:01,534
- Begging is good for the soul.
- We'll see.

334
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,454
Just do me a favor.

335
00:27:03,813 --> 00:27:06,173
Try not to be too...
confrontational.

336
00:27:06,654 --> 00:27:08,853
Confrontational?
Me? What do you mean?

337
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:10,613
I'll see if I left anything.

338
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,382
It's a unique time
in our history,

339
00:27:44,383 --> 00:27:46,249
in the history of
any civilization.

340
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:49,088
It's the moment of the
acquisition of technology.

341
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:52,007
That's the moment where
contact becomes possible.

342
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,927
The Very Large Array
in New Mexico...

343
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:57,328
...is the key to our
chances for success.

344
00:27:57,528 --> 00:27:59,528
With its 27 linked
radio telescopes...

345
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:01,607
...we can search
more accurately

346
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:03,167
than at any other facility.

347
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:05,489
We've gotten
approval to buy the

348
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,846
telescope time
from the government.

349
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,766
Now all we really
need is the money.

350
00:28:11,486 --> 00:28:13,406
A nice presentation, Doctor.

351
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:16,964
But while our foundation arm
has a mandate to support...

352
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:20,125
...experimental
programs, your proposal...

353
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,205
...seems less like science,
and more like science fiction.

354
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:27,964
Science fiction.

355
00:28:31,283 --> 00:28:32,603
You're right.

356
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:34,684
It's crazy.

357
00:28:35,724 --> 00:28:38,203
In fact, it's even
worse than that: nuts!

358
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:41,603
Want to hear something nutty?

359
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:44,202
Two guys wanted to build
a thing called an airplane.

360
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:47,321
People go in it and fly like
birds. Ridiculous, right?

361
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:49,241
What about breaking
the sound barrier...

362
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:51,029
...or rockets to the moon, or

363
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,001
atomic energy or
a mission to Mars?

364
00:28:53,242 --> 00:28:54,801
Science fiction, right?

365
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:58,561
All I'm asking
is for you to just

366
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:00,480
have the tiniest bit of vision.

367
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,039
To step back and look
at the big picture.

368
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,916
Take a chance on
something which could

369
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:09,240
end up the most
impactful moment...

370
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,679
...for humanity,
for the history...

371
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,518
...of history.

372
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:18,119
I'm sorry.

373
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,718
I just spent 13 months...

374
00:29:21,317 --> 00:29:24,037
...coming into rooms and
talking to people like you.

375
00:29:24,877 --> 00:29:26,198
You're my last chance.

376
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:29,116
Sorry I wasted your time.

377
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:29,876
Doctor.

378
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:31,757
Yes, sir.

379
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:44,795
You have your money.

380
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:48,836
Thank you.

381
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:51,795
Thank you.

382
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:40,708
Perfect cast! Come on, fishy!

383
00:30:40,948 --> 00:30:42,388
Frank, look at the size...

384
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,509
...of that
son-of-a-bitch!

385
00:30:56,427 --> 00:30:58,306
Welcome back, Dr. C.

386
00:30:58,547 --> 00:30:59,987
How'd it go?

387
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:02,147
How was the trip?

388
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:03,746
I've had better.

389
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:07,267
Drumlin! Is this a
personal vendetta now?

390
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:11,185
There's been enormous pressure
from other scientists as well.

391
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:14,384
It doesn't matter. Hadden's
funding us for 2 more years.

392
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:16,543
The government
doesn't want their

393
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:18,905
telescopes used by
the high priestess...

394
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:21,024
...of the desert anymore.

395
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:23,224
What?

396
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:26,584
Staring at TV static for hours,
listening to washing machines.

397
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:28,743
These stories get out!

398
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:30,544
I was seeking
patterns in the chaos!

399
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:32,704
It doesn't matter,
we're a joke to them.

400
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:34,223
They want us out!

401
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:38,703
We've got 3 months till
the paperwork goes through.

402
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:44,461
I'll start looking
for other funding.

403
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:48,581
Could you face reality?
Just this once? We lost.

404
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,541
It's over.

405
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,059
Fine.

406
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,219
I'm not stopping.

407
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,740
If I have to, I'll go it
alone. I've done it before.

408
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:54,974
My guest tonight is author
and theologian Palmer Joss.

409
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:57,613
He's become a
spiritual counselor, and

410
00:32:57,614 --> 00:32:59,813
a recent fixture
at the White House.

411
00:33:00,093 --> 00:33:02,933
"God's Diplomat," according
to The New York Times.

412
00:33:03,132 --> 00:33:05,068
His latest book,
"Losing Faith,"

413
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:06,653
is currently number one...

414
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:09,053
...on that publication's
bestseller list.

415
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:12,091
Thanks for being here.
You've had quite a ride...

416
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,731
...the last few years.

417
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,531
Yeah, I sure have, Larry.

418
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,410
Fish, I was thinking.

419
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:22,971
Who would make the best
astronomers? Think about it.

420
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,890
Who has the perfect synthesis
of career and lifestyle?

421
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,970
I give.

422
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:31,650
Vampires!

423
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,409
Are you anti-technology
and anti-science?

424
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:36,248
No, not at all.

425
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:39,248
The question that
I'm asking is this:

426
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:41,368
Are we happier...

427
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:43,714
...as a human
race? Is the world

428
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:45,367
fundamentally a better place...

429
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,488
...because of science
and technology?

430
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:50,488
We shop at home,
we surf the Web...

431
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:53,207
...but at the same
time we feel emptier...

432
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:55,659
...and more cut
off from each other

433
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,086
than at any other
time in human history.

434
00:33:58,326 --> 00:34:00,766
We're becoming a
synthesized society...

435
00:34:01,046 --> 00:34:03,126
...in a hurry to get to the...

436
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:18,845
We're looking for the meaning.

437
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:20,403
What is the meaning?

438
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:23,203
We have mindless jobs,
take frantic vacations.

439
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,442
Deficit finance trips to
the mall to buy things...

440
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:30,083
...that we think will fill
these holes in our lives.

441
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:32,842
Any wonder we've lost
our sense of direction?

442
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:13,637
Holy shit!

443
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:32,116
Right ascension...

444
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:36,035
...18 hours, 36
minutes, 56.2 seconds!

445
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:38,713
Declination...

446
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:41,835
...+ 36 degrees, 46 minutes...

447
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:44,314
...56.2 seconds!

448
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:48,114
Confirm!

449
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,273
Right ascension, 18
hours, 36 minutes...

450
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,513
...56.2 seconds!

451
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:56,873
Is anybody awake in there?
I'm moving the array!

452
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,953
- Confirm!

453
00:35:59,153 --> 00:36:00,592
Boss has a bogey!

454
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,913
Right ascension, 18 hours...

455
00:36:07,193 --> 00:36:08,350
We're on it!

456
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:09,471
36 hours...

457
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:11,791
...47 minutes and 1 second!

458
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:13,511
Strong possible...

459
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:16,111
...pulse chain
on sub-array four!

460
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,709
I'm moving the rest.
Confirm coordinates!

461
00:36:19,631 --> 00:36:21,430
Check the status of the array.

462
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,029
She's doing all the dishes.

463
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:24,270
Systems nominal.

464
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:30,988
Hello.

465
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:33,188
Full systems check!

466
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:36,588
Coordinates confirmed.
Willie's checking the system.

467
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:39,627
Stay on top of the
systems diagnostics!

468
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,547
Check reference point offsets.

469
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:45,587
And I want you off-axis on
27 the second we get there!

470
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:48,147
And tell Willie to
break out the big boy!

471
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,666
Copy that.

472
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:53,346
Yeah! Go, Ellie!

473
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:56,585
I hear it on the headphones.
We got to be sure about this.

474
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:58,986
Give me another array status.

475
00:37:00,745 --> 00:37:04,106
Her four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

476
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:08,745
But there's a bad drive on 16.

477
00:37:08,945 --> 00:37:11,265
The four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

478
00:37:11,544 --> 00:37:14,224
There's a bad drive
on 16. Copy that?

479
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:17,543
What shall I do about
the source queue?

480
00:37:17,743 --> 00:37:19,623
Forget it and hold the queue.

481
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:21,996
Get ready to set
the target frequency

482
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:23,943
to manual the
second we're aligned.

483
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:25,908
Do you copy? I want you to go

484
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,342
off-axis on 27 the
second we're there!

485
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:31,103
And leave the LO
frequency where it is!

486
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:34,460
Don't let it get away! If
you lose it, scan the band!

487
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:37,181
Run every frequency
you can think of.

488
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:43,580
How you doing?

489
00:37:47,981 --> 00:37:49,061
Talk to me, guys.

490
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:52,780
Partially polarized moving
pulses, amplitude modulated.

491
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,499
We're locked. Systems are
fine. What's the frequency?

492
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:57,658
4.46...

493
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,339
...23 gigahertz.

494
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:02,617
Hydrogen times pi.

495
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,059
Told you!

496
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:05,938
Strong sucker too!

497
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:08,457
I got it! I'm patched in!

498
00:38:09,138 --> 00:38:10,137
Let me hear.

499
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:16,937
Listen to that.

500
00:38:19,138 --> 00:38:21,016
Make me a liar, Fish.

501
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:24,056
It could be AWACS out
of Kirkland jamming us.

502
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:25,415
But I doubt it.

503
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:27,736
See if F.U.D.D.'s
reading it too.

504
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:31,735
Patch it back and
give me the off-axis.

505
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:33,934
- We recording?
- Never stopped.

506
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:37,175
Thank you, Elmer!

507
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,094
AWACS status is negative.

508
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:40,255
White Sands?

509
00:38:40,453 --> 00:38:42,013
On this frequency? No.

510
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,734
I'll punch up the darks.

511
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:47,933
How's spying tonight?

512
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:50,253
Come on!

513
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,813
NORAD's not tracking any
snoops in this vector.

514
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:56,572
Shuttle's in sleep mode.

515
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:58,973
Okay, point source confirmed.

516
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,772
Whatever it is, it ain't local.

517
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:01,771
Position?

518
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,331
I checked interferometry.
Somewhere in Lyra.

519
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:06,130
- Vega?
- Can't be!

520
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:08,252
It's only 26 light years away.

521
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:10,371
- Peak intensity?
- Coming up!

522
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,250
Vega.

523
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,849
Vega. I scanned
it a bunch of times

524
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,730
at Arecibo. It was
always negative.

525
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,890
Got it!

526
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,770
Reading over 100 janskys.

527
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,888
Jesus! I can pick
it up on my...

528
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:26,648
No!

529
00:39:58,565 --> 00:39:59,525
Come on!

530
00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:02,844
It's restarting.

531
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:05,844
Wait a minute.
Those are numbers.

532
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:07,724
That was 3, before it was 2.

533
00:40:09,163 --> 00:40:11,563
Base 10 numbers. Count
and see how far we get.

534
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:13,245
One.

535
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:20,603
Seven.

536
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:24,762
Those are primes.

537
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:28,042
2, 3, 5, 7 are
all prime numbers.

538
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:30,281
No way that's a
natural phenomenon!

539
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:33,201
Let's just calm down and
pull up the star file on Vega.

540
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,801
It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young.

541
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:39,561
It can't have a
planetary system...

542
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,880
...let alone life or a
technological civilization.

543
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:45,481
Maybe they're not from
there, they're visiting.

544
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:48,879
Spacecraft? This system's full
of debris. It'd get clobbered.

545
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:53,159
Not if they used their laser
blasters and photon torpedoes.

546
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:56,239
- That's not funny.
- How else can we explain it!

547
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:59,559
He's right. If we go public
with this and we're wrong...

548
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,958
...it's over. We're cooked.

549
00:41:04,677 --> 00:41:05,957
I wish Kent was here.

550
00:41:06,157 --> 00:41:09,478
Whatever it is, let's do
something. Vega will set.

551
00:41:12,716 --> 00:41:16,877
Position confirmed. We've got
4.4623 gigahertz, confirmed.

552
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:19,756
We've got 112 janskys.

553
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:22,195
Do you have a
source location yet?

554
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:26,916
We put it right
smack in the middle.

555
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:28,794
Vega.

556
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:33,674
Thanks. Keep tracking
and we'll get back to you.

557
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:35,074
Right-o.

558
00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:47,672
101. The pulse sequenced...

559
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:51,072
...through every prime
number between 2 and 101.

560
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:54,592
Who do we call now?

561
00:41:57,671 --> 00:41:58,631
Everybody.

562
00:42:06,071 --> 00:42:09,470
The rumors are flying, the
implications extraordinary.

563
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,471
Detection of an unidentified...

564
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,561
...radio source from space can

565
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:15,749
neither be
confirmed nor denied.

566
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:17,789
But the military arriving...

567
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:21,430
Sources close to the VLA report
they have been contacted...

568
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,550
...by some form of
intelligent being...

569
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,961
...living outside
our solar system.

570
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:28,029
Again, there is
no confirmation.

571
00:42:31,107 --> 00:42:33,108
I want all of these
people out of here.

572
00:42:33,907 --> 00:42:35,146
Where's the girl?

573
00:42:39,588 --> 00:42:40,865
22 stations worldwide...

574
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:42,426
...now confirm the signal.

575
00:42:42,587 --> 00:42:44,187
Vega's now below our horizon.

576
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:46,666
You're hearing the
signal from the Russian...

577
00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:48,386
Get decryption people here.

578
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:50,585
Lunacharsky's
visiting at Cal Tech.

579
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:52,066
Explain this to me.

580
00:42:52,306 --> 00:42:54,088
If the source of
the signal is so

581
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:56,185
sophisticated... why
the remedial math?

582
00:42:56,385 --> 00:42:57,665
Why not just speak English?

583
00:42:57,904 --> 00:43:01,184
Maybe because 70% of the
planet speaks other languages.

584
00:43:01,304 --> 00:43:04,063
Mathematics is the only
truly universal language.

585
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:07,103
It's no coincidence that
they're using primes.

586
00:43:07,344 --> 00:43:08,224
I don't get it.

587
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,704
Prime numbers.

588
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:13,263
Integers only divisible
by themselves and 1.

589
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:18,782
We think this may be a
beacon, an announcement...

590
00:43:19,062 --> 00:43:20,742
...to get our attention.

591
00:43:20,941 --> 00:43:24,502
If it's attention you want,
you got that. One thing: Vega.

592
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:28,020
People have looked at Vega
for years, with no results.

593
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:31,060
Yesterday they start
broadcasting primes. Why?

594
00:43:31,262 --> 00:43:32,581
It's hardly yesterday.

595
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:35,220
The signal's been
transmitting for 26 years.

596
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,899
Excuse me, who are you?

597
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,501
Michael Kitz, National
Security Advisor.

598
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,939
Your reputation...

599
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,379
First, ask the gentlemen
with the guns to wait outside.

600
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:48,059
This is a civilian facility.

601
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,699
With all due respect...

602
00:43:55,858 --> 00:43:56,698
Excuse me.

603
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,297
Hi! I'm so glad you're back!

604
00:44:00,857 --> 00:44:01,977
Come hear this.

605
00:44:02,698 --> 00:44:03,937
Is this great?

606
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:06,418
- Who are all these people?
- I have no idea.

607
00:44:06,617 --> 00:44:09,616
Sit down. We need help
with the spectrum analysis.

608
00:44:09,776 --> 00:44:11,377
- I'll get on it.
- Headsets.

609
00:44:11,577 --> 00:44:13,617
I'll just come
right to the point.

610
00:44:13,896 --> 00:44:15,815
Announcing this all
over the world may

611
00:44:15,816 --> 00:44:17,735
well be a breach of
national security.

612
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:19,536
It's not a
person-to-person call.

613
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:21,690
You think a
civilization sending this

614
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:23,696
message intends it
just for Americans?

615
00:44:23,854 --> 00:44:25,654
You might have consulted us.

616
00:44:25,974 --> 00:44:27,923
- The contents could
be very sensitive.

617
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:29,775
- You want to
classify prime numbers?

618
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:32,038
Due to earth's
rotation, we're in

619
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:33,613
line with Vega
only hours a day.

620
00:44:33,814 --> 00:44:35,835
The only way to
monitor the signal

621
00:44:35,836 --> 00:44:37,972
is to cooperate
with other stations.

622
00:44:38,213 --> 00:44:39,898
If Dr. Arroway hadn't acted

623
00:44:39,899 --> 00:44:42,333
quickly, we'd have
lost key elements.

624
00:44:42,532 --> 00:44:44,012
Fine, they've got the primes.

625
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:46,891
But if a more significant
transmission is to come...

626
00:44:47,092 --> 00:44:48,971
We need help to
receive and decode.

627
00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:51,732
You understand that
my job is to protect...

628
00:44:52,931 --> 00:44:54,772
- Listen.
- I hear it.

629
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,011
Hear what?

630
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,130
Harmonic.

631
00:44:57,331 --> 00:45:01,010
Bingo! I had Willie ask Rattan
to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.

632
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,731
There's a lot more here.

633
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:05,450
- Get on the negative sideband.
- I'm already on it.

634
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:06,730
What is it?

635
00:45:06,929 --> 00:45:08,330
Another signal!

636
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,250
A second signal at double
the frequency. Looks like...

637
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:13,369
Get a TV monitor!

638
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:15,849
Patch it into the
image processor.

639
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:17,289
Want the new data?

640
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:19,209
Yeah, the new one
we just recorded.

641
00:45:19,408 --> 00:45:21,289
David, explain
this to me, please.

642
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:24,169
There's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.

643
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:25,287
We're hot.

644
00:45:25,488 --> 00:45:28,127
Go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.

645
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:30,526
You're patched in.

646
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:34,047
It's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.

647
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:40,246
What do you make of that?

648
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:43,326
It's two different interlaced
frames. I'm framing one.

649
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:49,165
- It's just noise.
- Trying frame two.

650
00:45:50,326 --> 00:45:53,525
I've got an offset
carrier. I think it's audio.

651
00:45:53,724 --> 00:45:54,923
Plug it in!

652
00:45:59,043 --> 00:46:00,283
Center that segment.

653
00:46:00,483 --> 00:46:01,564
Centering.

654
00:46:05,644 --> 00:46:06,883
Can you clean it up?

655
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,482
I'm working on it.

656
00:46:20,923 --> 00:46:22,281
What the hell...?

657
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:24,201
Try zooming out.

658
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,961
Freeze!

659
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,401
Reverse values.

660
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,640
Try zooming out again.

661
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:39,559
Rotate 90 degrees
counterclock...

662
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:42,558
My God!

663
00:46:48,997 --> 00:46:50,398
What's going on?

664
00:46:50,918 --> 00:46:53,238
You're not going
to believe this.

665
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,797
Does anybody speak German?

666
00:47:09,156 --> 00:47:11,475
"I declare the
Games in Berlin...

667
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:14,155
...at the celebration...

668
00:47:14,355 --> 00:47:17,115
...of the first Olympics
of the New Era...

669
00:47:17,355 --> 00:47:18,595
...as opened. "

670
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:30,273
Get me the White House.

671
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:33,393
20 million people died
defeating the bastard...

672
00:47:33,593 --> 00:47:36,272
...and he's our first
ambassador to outer space?

673
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:38,076
The broadcast of
the '36 Olympics

674
00:47:38,077 --> 00:47:39,633
was the first TV
transmission...

675
00:47:39,873 --> 00:47:41,272
...that went into space.

676
00:47:41,512 --> 00:47:44,672
Sending it back is a way of
saying, "Hello, we heard you. "

677
00:47:44,912 --> 00:47:47,110
Or, "Sieg Heil, you're
our kind of people. "

678
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:49,712
Hitler's politics have
nothing to do with this.

679
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:53,391
It's unlikely they understood
it. People must understand...

680
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:55,871
The people are in very
good hands, Doctor.

681
00:47:56,031 --> 00:47:57,751
We'll take it from here.

682
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,631
Smile, folks. We're on.

683
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,109
A message of unknown
origin from deep space...

684
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:04,785
...was received by American

685
00:48:04,786 --> 00:48:06,750
scientists. Now
to the White House.

686
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:10,349
We're told the President will
have only a few remarks...

687
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:11,990
...about today's
extraordinary events...

688
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:15,428
...and that he won't be taking
any questions from the press.

689
00:48:20,228 --> 00:48:21,468
Good afternoon.

690
00:48:24,227 --> 00:48:26,267
I'm glad to be joined by my...

691
00:48:26,466 --> 00:48:28,307
...Science and
Technology Advisor.

692
00:48:29,988 --> 00:48:32,707
This is the product of
years of exploration...

693
00:48:32,906 --> 00:48:36,066
...by some of the world's
most distinguished scientists.

694
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:37,787
Like all discoveries...

695
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:40,225
...this one will
continue to be reviewed...

696
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:41,425
...examined...

697
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:43,065
...and scrutinized.

698
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:46,145
It must be confirmed
by other scientists.

699
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,545
But clearly...

700
00:48:48,065 --> 00:48:51,384
...the fact that this is being
explored is a vindication...

701
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:54,065
Fish, what is the
story over here? I

702
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:55,904
thought Ellie was
supposed to be on.

703
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:57,463
I don't know.

704
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,422
Guys?

705
00:49:01,663 --> 00:49:04,263
Those interlaced frames
we thought were noise?

706
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:07,743
This has structure.
I'm hearing structure.

707
00:49:09,063 --> 00:49:11,221
If this discovery
is confirmed...

708
00:49:11,422 --> 00:49:12,885
...it will be one of the most

709
00:49:12,886 --> 00:49:14,902
stunning insights
into our universe...

710
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:17,061
...that science
has ever uncovered.

711
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:19,781
Its implications are
as far-reaching...

712
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:22,500
...and awe-inspiring
as can be imagined.

713
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,021
Even as it promises answers to
some of our oldest questions...

714
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,780
...it poses still others...

715
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,539
...even more fundamental.

716
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,579
We will continue
to listen closely...

717
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,220
...to what it has to say...

718
00:49:33,419 --> 00:49:35,420
...as we continue the
search for answers...

719
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:36,859
...and for knowledge...

720
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,258
...that is as old
as humanity itself...

721
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:42,258
...but essential to
our people's future.

722
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:43,339
Thank you.

723
00:49:43,578 --> 00:49:46,338
Is there a renewed
assessment of security threat?

724
00:49:46,577 --> 00:49:49,457
I'll answer your questions
after a few corrections.

725
00:49:49,658 --> 00:49:51,338
The message was
received Friday...

726
00:49:51,497 --> 00:49:53,497
...at 6:31 a. m.
Mountain Standard Time.

727
00:49:53,737 --> 00:49:55,216
It was largely mathematical...

728
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:58,018
...and in spite of
reports to the contrary...

729
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:00,736
...appears to be
completely benign in nature.

730
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:04,656
Let me say that again. The
message is completely benign.

731
00:50:04,856 --> 00:50:07,936
The President has contacted
the world's heads of state...

732
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:10,775
...and every security
measure is being taken.

733
00:50:11,015 --> 00:50:13,936
To better explain the events
of the last 48 hours...

734
00:50:14,135 --> 00:50:16,280
...is the leader of
the scientific team

735
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:18,374
that made this
remarkable discovery...

736
00:50:18,614 --> 00:50:20,336
...Dr. David Drumlin, special

737
00:50:20,336 --> 00:50:22,413
Science Advisor
to the President.

738
00:50:30,134 --> 00:50:31,493
Thank you, Rachel.

739
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:32,813
Hello.

740
00:50:34,652 --> 00:50:37,052
In 1936 a very faint
television signal...

741
00:50:37,253 --> 00:50:39,384
...transmitted the
opening ceremonies

742
00:50:39,385 --> 00:50:41,291
of the Olympic
Games as a show...

743
00:50:41,532 --> 00:50:43,892
...of German
superior technology.

744
00:50:44,892 --> 00:50:46,604
That signal left Earth at the

745
00:50:46,605 --> 00:50:48,851
speed of light and
26 years later...

746
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:52,571
...arrived in the vicinity
of the star we call Vega.

747
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:57,409
That signal has been sent
back to us hugely amplified...

748
00:50:57,729 --> 00:51:00,570
...an unmistakable
sign of intelligence.

749
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:01,729
Kent, go ahead.

750
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:04,136
The Adolf transmission
used 25 frames

751
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:06,128
per second but
we're receiving 50.

752
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:10,050
So we put the other 25
through search algorithms.

753
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:12,727
We found a series of markers
on the top of each frame.

754
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:14,607
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go ahead!

755
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:15,889
Send it, Willie.

756
00:51:16,128 --> 00:51:17,568
Here it comes.

757
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:22,006
It's digital...

758
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:24,048
...massive amounts
of data which

759
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:26,167
extend right to the
higher harmonics.

760
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,168
Jackpot!

761
00:51:29,405 --> 00:51:31,285
All right, as you'll see...

762
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:34,726
...interlaced with the frames
of the original Hitler image...

763
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,685
...we found these sections.

764
00:51:37,885 --> 00:51:41,165
We thought they were noise,
but they're actually data...

765
00:51:41,325 --> 00:51:42,604
...huge amounts of it.

766
00:51:42,805 --> 00:51:44,738
When we combine this with the

767
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:47,003
data from the
original signal...

768
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:50,324
...we get these
encrypted pages of text.

769
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:54,523
No two are alike and we've
uncovered over 10,000 already.

770
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:56,764
What does it mean, Doctor?

771
00:51:57,163 --> 00:51:59,882
We have no idea. It
could be anything.

772
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:02,122
Volume 1 of an
Encyclopedia Galactica.

773
00:52:02,321 --> 00:52:04,842
Instructions for us on their
colonization procedures.

774
00:52:05,043 --> 00:52:07,282
Moses with a few
billion new commandments.

775
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:09,521
How long will it
take to decode it?

776
00:52:09,722 --> 00:52:12,921
It could take forever.
We really need a primer...

777
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:16,040
We need to get the best
decryption people we have.

778
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:20,641
I intend to use the
VLA as my command post.

779
00:52:20,761 --> 00:52:24,201
In the meantime, my office has
made out a preliminary budget.

780
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,638
Wait a minute.

781
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,040
This is a
privately-funded operation.

782
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:30,438
We lease dish time
from the government...

783
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:33,160
This is a clear-cut
case of eminent domain.

784
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,025
I'm recommending
to the President

785
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,398
we militarize this project.

786
00:52:36,558 --> 00:52:38,999
What?! This is my project!

787
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:42,357
Nobody knows more about this
than I do. David, tell them...

788
00:52:42,517 --> 00:52:45,438
Excuse me! Could
we calm down here?

789
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:48,077
I'm going to recommend
that Dr. Drumlin

790
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:50,117
coordinate the
decryption effort.

791
00:52:50,317 --> 00:52:51,722
But in light of Dr. Arroway's

792
00:52:51,723 --> 00:52:53,517
long experience
in these matters...

793
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:57,717
...for the time being, she will
direct operations at the VLA...

794
00:52:57,876 --> 00:53:00,232
...understanding that
future discoveries

795
00:53:00,233 --> 00:53:02,357
will be kept in
strict confidence...

796
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:04,675
...until such time
as the President...

797
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:08,594
...can decide the most suitable
course of action. Understood?

798
00:53:08,755 --> 00:53:09,715
Yes.

799
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:12,115
This is CNN Breaking News.

800
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:15,513
The President called
the message from Vega...

801
00:53:15,713 --> 00:53:17,753
..."a stunning insight
into our universe... "

802
00:53:17,954 --> 00:53:20,314
Attendance at
religious services has

803
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:22,673
risen a dramatic
39% in recent days.

804
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:26,513
...as police clashed
with neo-Nazi protesters.

805
00:53:26,752 --> 00:53:28,792
So, there's life
on other planets.

806
00:53:28,993 --> 00:53:32,431
Boy, this will really change
the Miss Universe contest.

807
00:53:33,073 --> 00:53:34,830
Health officials worldwide are

808
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:37,231
concerned that the
message from Vega...

809
00:53:37,392 --> 00:53:39,912
...might trigger a
rash of mass suicides...

810
00:53:40,112 --> 00:53:42,630
...not unlike recent cult
deaths near San Diego...

811
00:53:42,832 --> 00:53:44,710
Even a scientist must admit...

812
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:47,030
...there are some
pretty serious

813
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:49,151
religious overtones
to all this.

814
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,509
Here's someone
whose organization...

815
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,070
...is accused of conducting
its own inquisition:

816
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:56,950
Richard Rank, head of the
Conservative Coalition.

817
00:53:57,149 --> 00:53:58,150
Thank you.

818
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:00,515
This is yet another
example of science

819
00:54:00,516 --> 00:54:02,348
intruding into
matters of faith.

820
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:06,587
This means they have been
reacting to TV signals...

821
00:54:06,748 --> 00:54:09,507
...from the 1930's.
They're just getting them.

822
00:54:09,707 --> 00:54:11,197
Imagine how disappointed

823
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:13,307
they'll be if
they're Cubs fans.

824
00:54:13,548 --> 00:54:16,466
We now go to Jeremy
Roth, who is reporting...

825
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:19,988
...from the Very Large Array
near Socorro, New Mexico.

826
00:54:20,187 --> 00:54:21,627
Like a bolt from
the blue it came.

827
00:54:21,866 --> 00:54:23,746
"The Message from
Vega" has caused...

828
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:26,266
...thousands of believers
and non-believers...

829
00:54:26,426 --> 00:54:28,279
...to descend upon
the VLA facility

830
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,026
here in the desert
of New Mexico.

831
00:54:30,186 --> 00:54:32,705
Many have come to
protest, many to pray...

832
00:54:32,905 --> 00:54:35,058
...but most have
come to participate

833
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:37,385
in what's become the
best show in town.

834
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:45,184
Well, I saw the thing
coming out of the sky

835
00:54:45,504 --> 00:54:48,503
It had one long
horn and one big eye

836
00:54:48,783 --> 00:54:51,303
I commenced to
shaking and said Oo-ee

837
00:54:51,742 --> 00:54:54,582
Looks like a Purple
People Eater to me

838
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:45,096
Hail to Vega Hail to Vega

839
00:55:50,816 --> 00:55:52,537
But they have failed!

840
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:55,695
It's the same people
who, again and again...

841
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,936
...have brought us to
the brink of destruction!

842
00:55:58,176 --> 00:56:01,694
Who've polluted our air,
who've poisoned our water!

843
00:56:03,135 --> 00:56:05,135
Now these scientists...

844
00:56:06,015 --> 00:56:07,895
...have had their chance.

845
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:11,054
Are these the kind of people...

846
00:56:11,414 --> 00:56:15,094
...that you want talking
to your God for you?

847
00:56:18,853 --> 00:56:20,732
Efforts continue
around the clock.

848
00:56:20,893 --> 00:56:22,728
But for now,
almost 2 full weeks

849
00:56:22,729 --> 00:56:24,453
after the message's arrival...

850
00:56:24,573 --> 00:56:27,731
...scientists here at the
VLA still have no answers...

851
00:56:27,931 --> 00:56:29,613
...only more questions.

852
00:56:29,812 --> 00:56:33,011
Jeremy Roth, CNN,
Socorro, New Mexico.

853
00:56:33,331 --> 00:56:36,572
More on the quest for the
message's meaning, after this.

854
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:41,010
They have to line up somehow.

855
00:56:41,251 --> 00:56:43,090
This one doesn't fit, either.

856
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:45,850
We've tried over a
million permutations.

857
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,210
Always, I can only get
three corners to fit.

858
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,251
I don't understand
their significance.

859
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:35,004
Somebody broke in...

860
00:57:41,205 --> 00:57:42,203
Hello?

861
00:57:43,124 --> 00:57:46,203
Whoever you are, you
broke into the database...

862
00:57:49,043 --> 00:57:50,323
What? Now?

863
00:57:53,042 --> 00:57:54,202
Where?

864
00:58:05,602 --> 00:58:07,521
I'll be there.

865
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:35,956
You should feel fortunate.

866
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:38,037
He hardly lands for anyone.

867
00:59:08,474 --> 00:59:10,194
Dr. Arroway.

868
00:59:13,952 --> 00:59:15,233
I presume?

869
00:59:16,434 --> 00:59:17,593
Mr. Hadden.

870
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:21,911
I've had my eye on you
a long time, Doctor.

871
00:59:22,672 --> 00:59:26,072
I consider you one of my most
valuable long-term investments.

872
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,151
And when it comes
to my investments...

873
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,390
...I always do my homework.

874
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,591
Eleanor Ann Arroway...

875
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:43,189
...born 25th August, 1964...

876
00:59:43,391 --> 00:59:44,910
...De Pere, Wisconsin.

877
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:46,820
Mother, Joanna, died from

878
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:49,150
complications
during childbirth.

879
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:52,429
Early testing indicated
high predisposition...

880
00:59:52,628 --> 00:59:55,507
...towards science
and mathematics.

881
00:59:56,187 --> 00:59:57,308
Father, Theodore...

882
00:59:57,509 --> 00:59:59,296
...advised to
provide enrichment

883
00:59:59,297 --> 01:00:00,867
activities in these areas...

884
01:00:01,068 --> 01:00:03,707
...did so conscientiously
until his death...

885
01:00:03,907 --> 01:00:07,587
...from myocardial
infarction, November 10, 1974.

886
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:12,146
You graduated from
high school in 1979...

887
01:00:12,387 --> 01:00:14,267
...almost two full years early.

888
01:00:15,587 --> 01:00:17,506
Awarded full
scholarship, M.I.T...

889
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:19,786
...graduated magna cum laude.

890
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:22,346
Doctoral work, Cal Tech...

891
01:00:22,546 --> 01:00:25,506
...where you worked on the
lanthanide-doped ruby maser...

892
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,655
...dramatically increasing the

893
01:00:27,656 --> 01:00:29,865
sensitivity of
radio telescopes.

894
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:31,919
Subsequently offered a teaching

895
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,744
position at Harvard
University...

896
01:00:33,943 --> 01:00:36,903
...which you turned down
to pursue SETI work...

897
01:00:37,104 --> 01:00:40,383
...at the Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico.

898
01:00:42,703 --> 01:00:45,104
Changes in N.S.F. policy...

899
01:00:45,463 --> 01:00:48,702
...gave rise to certain
funding problems...

900
01:00:49,743 --> 01:00:51,181
...at which point...

901
01:00:51,662 --> 01:00:53,542
...you came to my attention.

902
01:00:54,823 --> 01:00:57,061
You compromised
our security codes.

903
01:00:59,341 --> 01:01:01,100
Once upon a time...

904
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,020
...I was a hell of an engineer.

905
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,260
Please, sit, Doctor.

906
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,676
I have guests so rarely, it's

907
01:01:09,677 --> 01:01:12,299
important they feel
welcome in my home.

908
01:01:13,299 --> 01:01:14,579
You live here?

909
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:19,339
I find it convenient
to keep my interests...

910
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:21,579
...mobile.

911
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:28,138
Anyway, I've had my fill
of life on the ground.

912
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:31,257
I guess I should...

913
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,437
I guess I should thank you for

914
01:01:33,438 --> 01:01:35,337
having bailed me
out all that time.

915
01:01:40,457 --> 01:01:42,496
I know a good bet
when I see one.

916
01:01:44,776 --> 01:01:47,495
Earl Grey. No sugar,
no milk, I believe.

917
01:01:50,696 --> 01:01:52,455
What am I doing here?

918
01:02:02,414 --> 01:02:05,374
The powers that be have
been very busy lately...

919
01:02:06,174 --> 01:02:08,012
...positioning themselves...

920
01:02:08,173 --> 01:02:10,852
...for the game
of the millennium.

921
01:02:17,372 --> 01:02:19,893
Maybe I can help
deal you back in.

922
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:23,412
I didn't realize
that I was out.

923
01:02:23,972 --> 01:02:25,772
No. Maybe not out...

924
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:29,090
...but certainly
being handed your hat.

925
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:37,810
I've had a long time
to make enemies, Doctor.

926
01:02:41,209 --> 01:02:42,769
There are many governments...

927
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:44,488
...business interests...

928
01:02:45,049 --> 01:02:47,050
...even religious
leaders that would

929
01:02:47,051 --> 01:02:48,889
like to see me
depart this earth.

930
01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:52,729
And I'll grant them
their wish soon enough.

931
01:02:53,248 --> 01:02:56,728
But before I do, I wish to
make a small contribution.

932
01:02:57,527 --> 01:02:59,543
A final gesture
of goodwill to the

933
01:02:59,544 --> 01:03:01,848
people of this planet
who have given...

934
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:07,166
...from whom I
have taken so much.

935
01:03:10,446 --> 01:03:11,886
You found the primer.

936
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,285
Clever girl!

937
01:03:16,404 --> 01:03:17,125
Lights.

938
01:03:25,365 --> 01:03:28,004
Pages and pages of data.

939
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:31,523
Over 63,000 in all.

940
01:03:31,723 --> 01:03:33,804
And on the perimeter of each...

941
01:03:34,004 --> 01:03:37,442
Alignment symbols, registration
marks, but they don't line up.

942
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:39,081
They do...

943
01:03:39,362 --> 01:03:40,963
...if you think like a Vegan.

944
01:03:41,883 --> 01:03:44,722
An alien intelligence has
got be more advanced...

945
01:03:44,882 --> 01:03:46,571
...and that means efficiency

946
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,683
functioning on
multiple levels...

947
01:03:48,962 --> 01:03:50,721
...and in multiple...

948
01:03:50,922 --> 01:03:52,641
...dimensions.

949
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,361
Yes, of course!

950
01:03:58,921 --> 01:03:59,961
Where's the primer?

951
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,680
You'll see.

952
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:06,520
Every three-dimensional page
contains a piece of the primer.

953
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,959
There it was all the time,
staring you in the face.

954
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,632
Buried within the message

955
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:16,918
itself is the key
to decoding it.

956
01:04:17,198 --> 01:04:18,895
Within the layering
of the matrix,

957
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,397
we have these basic equations:

958
01:04:22,118 --> 01:04:24,252
So with this very
elementary foundation,

959
01:04:24,253 --> 01:04:25,918
they have given us a kind of...

960
01:04:26,117 --> 01:04:28,476
...general
scientific vocabulary.

961
01:04:28,678 --> 01:04:30,838
We now have the symbols
for true and false...

962
01:04:31,037 --> 01:04:32,317
This was the key...

963
01:04:32,516 --> 01:04:34,837
...that allowed us to
decipher their language...

964
01:04:35,076 --> 01:04:38,556
...for physics, geometry,
chemistry. Next frame, Ellie.

965
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:43,555
Yes, and when we apply this
to the rest of the message...

966
01:04:44,435 --> 01:04:45,396
...we find this.

967
01:04:49,674 --> 01:04:51,091
Those look like engineering

968
01:04:51,092 --> 01:04:53,035
schematics, almost
like blueprints.

969
01:04:54,354 --> 01:04:55,314
Yes.

970
01:04:55,594 --> 01:04:56,932
It is our belief that the

971
01:04:56,933 --> 01:04:58,753
message contains
instructions...

972
01:04:58,914 --> 01:05:02,274
...for building something,
some kind of machine.

973
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:05,233
A machine? That
does what, Doctor?

974
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:07,672
We don't know. It
might be some type...

975
01:05:08,591 --> 01:05:10,822
...of advanced
communication device,

976
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,992
or a teaching
machine of some kind.

977
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:15,712
Or it might be...

978
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:17,592
...some kind of a transport.

979
01:05:17,992 --> 01:05:20,431
- Transport?
- There's no proof of that.

980
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:24,071
The fact is you don't know what
it does. It could be anything.

981
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,916
A Trojan Horse. We build it and

982
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:27,631
out pours the
entire Vegan army.

983
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:30,269
Why risk the personnel?
It could be a weapon.

984
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:32,711
Right. Some kind of
a Doomsday Machine.

985
01:05:32,911 --> 01:05:35,229
Every time they detect
a new civilization...

986
01:05:35,429 --> 01:05:37,629
...they fax construction
plans from space.

987
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,641
We poor saps build
this thing and

988
01:05:39,642 --> 01:05:41,309
blow ourselves to kingdom come.

989
01:05:41,549 --> 01:05:44,988
There's no reason to believe
their intentions are hostile.

990
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:48,709
Why is it the egghead position
that aliens are always benign?

991
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:51,108
We pose no threat to them.

992
01:05:51,307 --> 01:05:53,787
It'd be like us going
out of our way...

993
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:55,667
...to destroy
microbes on an anthill.

994
01:05:55,867 --> 01:05:57,227
Interesting analogy.

995
01:05:57,827 --> 01:05:59,432
How guilty would we feel if we

996
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:01,626
destroyed a few
microbes on an anthill?

997
01:06:01,786 --> 01:06:02,867
I hope you're right.

998
01:06:03,266 --> 01:06:04,226
I really do.

999
01:06:04,425 --> 01:06:05,777
But my job is to protect

1000
01:06:05,777 --> 01:06:07,746
American lives
from any threat...

1001
01:06:07,946 --> 01:06:09,986
...so I am obligated
to assume the worst.

1002
01:06:10,185 --> 01:06:12,105
Yes, and I am forced
to agree with you.

1003
01:06:12,305 --> 01:06:13,745
My problem is this:

1004
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,425
The content of that message
is morally ambiguous at best.

1005
01:06:18,065 --> 01:06:19,855
Our internal
numbers show support

1006
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:21,384
for this is incredibly soft.

1007
01:06:21,585 --> 01:06:24,145
If the President
stays this course...

1008
01:06:24,303 --> 01:06:26,943
...his numbers will be going
south like ducks in winter.

1009
01:06:27,223 --> 01:06:28,224
This is nuts!

1010
01:06:28,463 --> 01:06:29,423
Excuse me...

1011
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:30,543
...Miss.

1012
01:06:31,024 --> 01:06:33,423
We know nothing of
these creatures' values.

1013
01:06:33,662 --> 01:06:36,143
We don't even know whether
they believe in God.

1014
01:06:36,342 --> 01:06:38,022
This doesn't make
any sense. If...

1015
01:06:38,224 --> 01:06:39,942
Excuse me, Dr. Arroway.

1016
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:42,541
We won't be suppressing
any opinions here today.

1017
01:06:43,342 --> 01:06:45,381
No, of course
not. I understand.

1018
01:06:46,342 --> 01:06:47,702
What I meant to say...

1019
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:51,381
...is the message was written
in the language of science.

1020
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,302
If it was religious in nature,

1021
01:06:53,303 --> 01:06:54,982
it should have
taken the form...

1022
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:57,740
...of a burning bush
or a voice from the sky.

1023
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,899
But a voice from the sky...

1024
01:07:00,981 --> 01:07:03,419
...is exactly what you
found, Doctor Arroway.

1025
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:08,658
I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.

1026
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,978
I agree with Mr. Rank that
there are unavoidable...

1027
01:07:14,179 --> 01:07:16,259
...religious
implications at stake.

1028
01:07:16,457 --> 01:07:18,778
But that doesn't justify
being an alarmist.

1029
01:07:20,657 --> 01:07:22,978
I hope that we can
find a common ground...

1030
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:26,298
...break through obstacles
that may have kept us apart.

1031
01:07:27,218 --> 01:07:29,536
Listen, I need to make
one thing very clear.

1032
01:07:29,736 --> 01:07:32,135
Our organization
will not be placated

1033
01:07:32,136 --> 01:07:34,217
with flowery New
Age rhetoric...

1034
01:07:34,935 --> 01:07:35,655
Mr. President!

1035
01:07:38,136 --> 01:07:40,175
The President met
with top advisors...

1036
01:07:40,334 --> 01:07:43,535
...regarding the latest
efforts to decode the message.

1037
01:07:43,735 --> 01:07:45,955
While there has
been some progress,

1038
01:07:45,956 --> 01:07:48,175
the official line
remains cautious.

1039
01:07:48,373 --> 01:07:50,415
If you're asking
when we'll find out...

1040
01:07:50,574 --> 01:07:52,854
...what the purpose
of that Machine is...

1041
01:07:53,813 --> 01:07:56,452
...maybe tomorrow, maybe
next year, maybe never.

1042
01:08:00,693 --> 01:08:02,998
There he is. The
man with his finger

1043
01:08:02,998 --> 01:08:05,053
on the nation's
spiritual pulse.

1044
01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:07,973
It's so good to see you.

1045
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:09,211
You too.

1046
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:14,652
Your discovery, all of this.
It must be a real vindication.

1047
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,851
I'm really happy for you.

1048
01:08:17,491 --> 01:08:18,450
Are you?

1049
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:20,972
Mr. Joss, the
President's waiting.

1050
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,170
The President's waiting.

1051
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:30,810
See you at the reception?

1052
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:33,049
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

1053
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,888
Miss Constantine,
may I speak to you?

1054
01:08:47,088 --> 01:08:48,407
Certainly.

1055
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:51,687
I have a big problem.

1056
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:56,486
Do you know where I can
find a really great dress?

1057
01:09:15,205 --> 01:09:16,880
God created man in the form of

1058
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:19,004
Himself, not in
the form of monkeys!

1059
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:29,683
Get a job! Don't
waste my tax dollars!

1060
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,639
You look beautiful, Ellie.

1061
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,478
- So do you.
- You really do.

1062
01:10:04,038 --> 01:10:05,439
I read your book.

1063
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:07,518
Here we go.

1064
01:10:07,919 --> 01:10:09,399
You want me to quote you?

1065
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:11,358
"Ironically...

1066
01:10:11,678 --> 01:10:13,558
...the thing people
are most hungry for...

1067
01:10:13,798 --> 01:10:14,998
...meaning...

1068
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,595
...is the one thing science

1069
01:10:16,596 --> 01:10:18,358
hasn't been able
to give them. "

1070
01:10:18,596 --> 01:10:19,516
Yeah.

1071
01:10:21,757 --> 01:10:23,637
It's like you're saying that...

1072
01:10:23,918 --> 01:10:26,197
...science killed God.

1073
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:29,277
What if science
simply revealed...

1074
01:10:29,836 --> 01:10:32,156
...that He never existed
in the first place?

1075
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:37,595
I think we need
to get some air.

1076
01:10:38,556 --> 01:10:40,275
And a few more of these.

1077
01:10:41,794 --> 01:10:42,915
Thank you.

1078
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:46,235
A little chilly out here.

1079
01:10:46,474 --> 01:10:47,834
Yeah, this is nice.

1080
01:10:48,194 --> 01:10:49,313
I got one for you.

1081
01:10:49,554 --> 01:10:51,154
Occam's Razor.
Ever heard of it?

1082
01:10:51,393 --> 01:10:53,914
Occam's Razor. Sounds
like some slasher movie.

1083
01:10:54,154 --> 01:10:55,706
No, Occam's Razor is a basic

1084
01:10:55,707 --> 01:10:57,593
scientific
principle which says:

1085
01:10:57,952 --> 01:10:59,581
Things being
equal, the simplest

1086
01:10:59,582 --> 01:11:01,113
explanation tends to be right.

1087
01:11:01,354 --> 01:11:02,593
Makes sense to me.

1088
01:11:03,032 --> 01:11:04,112
So what's more likely?

1089
01:11:04,313 --> 01:11:05,232
Thank you.

1090
01:11:05,832 --> 01:11:08,392
An all-powerful God
created the universe...

1091
01:11:08,551 --> 01:11:11,392
...then decided not to give
any proof of His existence?

1092
01:11:11,591 --> 01:11:12,630
Or...

1093
01:11:12,911 --> 01:11:15,991
...that He doesn't exist at
all and that we created Him...

1094
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,670
...so we wouldn't feel
so small and alone.

1095
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:20,630
I don't know.

1096
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:24,709
I couldn't imagine living in
a world where God didn't exist.

1097
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:26,990
I wouldn't want to.

1098
01:11:27,589 --> 01:11:29,869
How do you know you're
not deluding yourself?

1099
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:31,789
I mean, for me...

1100
01:11:31,948 --> 01:11:33,709
...I'd need proof.

1101
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:35,629
Proof?

1102
01:11:38,707 --> 01:11:40,308
Did you love your father?

1103
01:11:41,349 --> 01:11:42,988
Your dad, did you love him?

1104
01:11:44,108 --> 01:11:46,188
Yes. Very much.

1105
01:11:49,548 --> 01:11:50,667
Prove it.

1106
01:11:57,467 --> 01:11:58,466
Kent.

1107
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:00,546
The White House.

1108
01:12:03,505 --> 01:12:05,512
No excuses.
Whoever's responsible,

1109
01:12:05,513 --> 01:12:07,345
I want their head on a platter.

1110
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:08,785
What happened?

1111
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:10,783
You were right all along.

1112
01:12:11,145 --> 01:12:13,824
The team at the VLA has
worked around the clock...

1113
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:16,384
...and the hard work
has finally paid off.

1114
01:12:16,944 --> 01:12:18,789
This key section
uncovered tonight,

1115
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,584
and obtained
exclusively by CNN...

1116
01:12:20,743 --> 01:12:23,223
...shows an illustration
of a human figure...

1117
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,182
...inside a geometric
structure of some kind.

1118
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:28,142
This and other
contextual clues...

1119
01:12:28,382 --> 01:12:29,531
...now lead scientists to

1120
01:12:29,532 --> 01:12:31,183
believe the message
is, in fact...

1121
01:12:31,423 --> 01:12:33,575
- President called
an emergency meeting.

1122
01:12:33,576 --> 01:12:34,781
- I imagined he would.

1123
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:37,982
...designed to take a single
human occupant into space...

1124
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:40,622
...presumably to the star Vega.

1125
01:13:03,298 --> 01:13:04,459
Tell me.

1126
01:13:04,978 --> 01:13:05,978
They will build it.

1127
01:13:06,218 --> 01:13:06,978
Who goes?

1128
01:13:07,218 --> 01:13:08,957
The President's
gone international

1129
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:10,498
to spread the risk and cost...

1130
01:13:10,738 --> 01:13:11,578
Who goes?

1131
01:13:12,337 --> 01:13:13,937
Well, it's complicated.

1132
01:13:15,297 --> 01:13:18,617
They have formed a group
of international candidates.

1133
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:20,736
Now, it's your discovery.

1134
01:13:21,217 --> 01:13:22,787
They understand that. You're

1135
01:13:22,788 --> 01:13:24,695
at the top of a
very short list.

1136
01:13:25,095 --> 01:13:27,497
But they're also forming
a selection committee.

1137
01:13:27,735 --> 01:13:29,985
It's made of
scholars, theologians,

1138
01:13:29,986 --> 01:13:31,734
scientists, philosophers...

1139
01:13:31,935 --> 01:13:32,493
You're on it.

1140
01:13:33,974 --> 01:13:35,213
I've been asked, yes.

1141
01:13:38,052 --> 01:13:39,613
I guess that means...

1142
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:42,932
...that you're a selector,
I'm a selectee and we can't...

1143
01:13:43,172 --> 01:13:44,212
Yeah.

1144
01:13:44,413 --> 01:13:46,612
What you don't
understand, Ellie, is...

1145
01:13:46,931 --> 01:13:48,091
I understand.

1146
01:13:49,572 --> 01:13:51,226
I want you to know, whatever

1147
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,411
happens, as far
as I'm concerned...

1148
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,051
Good luck.

1149
01:14:02,169 --> 01:14:03,710
Whatever you do, make sure he

1150
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:05,570
doesn't monopolize
the committee.

1151
01:14:05,769 --> 01:14:07,690
He is not on the
committee, Ellie.

1152
01:14:11,529 --> 01:14:14,409
He just resigned. He
wants to be the one to go.

1153
01:14:16,528 --> 01:14:19,687
The President is already
feeling the financial pinch.

1154
01:14:19,847 --> 01:14:22,967
Sources say the cost of
the project is spiralling...

1155
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:25,767
...to more than a third
of a trillion dollars...

1156
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:27,371
...making this perhaps the

1157
01:14:27,372 --> 01:14:29,206
most expensive
single project...

1158
01:14:29,368 --> 01:14:31,167
...in all of human history.

1159
01:14:31,407 --> 01:14:33,326
Months of debate
finally reached...

1160
01:14:33,486 --> 01:14:35,304
...a conclusion last week as 10

1161
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:37,767
candidates were
selected by the I.M.C...

1162
01:14:38,206 --> 01:14:39,858
...representing a cross section

1163
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:41,726
of political and
religious views.

1164
01:14:41,925 --> 01:14:44,404
Many are the same experts
who have consulted...

1165
01:14:44,645 --> 01:14:46,805
...on the Machine's
design and function.

1166
01:14:47,005 --> 01:14:49,218
They will actively
participate on-site,

1167
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:51,044
during the
construction process.

1168
01:14:51,524 --> 01:14:52,647
The choice of these 10

1169
01:14:52,648 --> 01:14:54,485
candidates has
been controversial.

1170
01:14:54,684 --> 01:14:57,403
One-third of the
candidates are American.

1171
01:14:57,604 --> 01:15:00,243
And many international
observers ask why.

1172
01:15:00,764 --> 01:15:03,243
The U.S. is shouldering
a large part of the cost...

1173
01:15:03,443 --> 01:15:06,282
Isn't it true that contractors,
like Hadden Industries...

1174
01:15:06,483 --> 01:15:09,643
...are making contributions in
exchange for technology rights?

1175
01:15:09,882 --> 01:15:13,242
Different nations are being
compensated in different ways.

1176
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:15,590
Japan made headlines
by opting to

1177
01:15:15,591 --> 01:15:17,802
forego candidate
representation...

1178
01:15:18,082 --> 01:15:21,081
...in exchange for the systems
integration subcontract.

1179
01:15:21,321 --> 01:15:22,960
On what basis do you choose...

1180
01:15:23,161 --> 01:15:25,920
...a human being to
represent humanity?

1181
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,200
Good question, Larry.

1182
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,080
If nothing else...

1183
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:31,296
...it should be
somebody fluent in

1184
01:15:31,297 --> 01:15:33,319
the language the
message was given in.

1185
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,680
Science, in this case.

1186
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,559
Despite your
obvious enthusiasm...

1187
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,878
...there's been a
lot of criticism...

1188
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:42,639
...that this endeavor
is simply too dangerous.

1189
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,158
Some of that criticism
from scientists.

1190
01:15:45,358 --> 01:15:48,037
One Nobel Prize winner
noted, his words:

1191
01:15:48,798 --> 01:15:50,438
"There is every indication...

1192
01:15:50,638 --> 01:15:52,682
...that this is beyond
our capabilities,

1193
01:15:52,683 --> 01:15:54,277
that this endeavor will fail...

1194
01:15:54,477 --> 01:15:56,206
...and that the
Machine's occupant

1195
01:15:56,207 --> 01:15:57,838
will pay for it
with his life. "

1196
01:15:58,036 --> 01:15:59,717
How do you respond?

1197
01:15:59,917 --> 01:16:01,105
This message is from a

1198
01:16:01,106 --> 01:16:03,155
civilization that
may be anywhere...

1199
01:16:03,356 --> 01:16:05,191
...from hundreds
to millions and

1200
01:16:05,192 --> 01:16:06,916
millions of years ahead of us.

1201
01:16:07,156 --> 01:16:10,195
I have to believe that an
intelligence that advanced...

1202
01:16:10,795 --> 01:16:12,395
...knows what they're doing.

1203
01:16:13,795 --> 01:16:16,994
Now all it requires
on our part is...

1204
01:16:17,634 --> 01:16:18,555
Faith?

1205
01:16:21,515 --> 01:16:23,514
I was going to say,
a sense of adventure.

1206
01:16:23,715 --> 01:16:25,114
And in breaking news...

1207
01:16:25,313 --> 01:16:26,673
...astronaut John Russell...

1208
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,885
...considered to be
the leading American

1209
01:16:28,886 --> 01:16:30,553
candidate for the
Machine seat...

1210
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:32,952
...has dropped
out of the running.

1211
01:16:33,353 --> 01:16:36,271
Russell met with reporters
today at his Houston home.

1212
01:16:36,673 --> 01:16:38,672
I told my dad I
didn't want him...

1213
01:16:39,392 --> 01:16:40,432
...to go.

1214
01:16:40,632 --> 01:16:42,031
Daddy, don't go.

1215
01:16:44,832 --> 01:16:46,512
Nothing would give
me more pride...

1216
01:16:46,711 --> 01:16:47,791
...than to...

1217
01:16:48,432 --> 01:16:50,350
...represent my country.

1218
01:16:50,671 --> 01:16:52,310
But what can I say to this?

1219
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:56,790
Consortium officials had no
comment, but inside sources...

1220
01:16:56,989 --> 01:16:58,870
...have disclosed
that Dr. Arroway...

1221
01:16:59,069 --> 01:17:00,605
...appears to now be the

1222
01:17:00,606 --> 01:17:02,910
front-runner for
the Machine seat.

1223
01:17:03,988 --> 01:17:06,269
"Meet me at noon. Must talk. "

1224
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:08,789
I didn't expect a message
like this from you.

1225
01:17:08,948 --> 01:17:10,229
Thanks for coming.

1226
01:17:10,428 --> 01:17:13,268
Is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1227
01:17:13,468 --> 01:17:16,467
Selectors and selectees
mingling around?

1228
01:17:16,987 --> 01:17:18,708
Can we talk about Einstein?

1229
01:17:19,227 --> 01:17:20,747
Yeah, sure.

1230
01:17:21,427 --> 01:17:24,506
Special relativity.
This Machine...

1231
01:17:25,986 --> 01:17:29,907
...if it works, you travel
to Vega at the speed of light.

1232
01:17:30,106 --> 01:17:32,186
- When you come back...
- If you come back.

1233
01:17:34,426 --> 01:17:36,025
If you come back...

1234
01:17:36,506 --> 01:17:38,497
...you'll be 4
years older, but over

1235
01:17:38,498 --> 01:17:40,705
50 years will have
passed here on Earth.

1236
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:42,104
Basically.

1237
01:17:42,905 --> 01:17:45,304
And everybody that
you care about...

1238
01:17:46,264 --> 01:17:48,463
...will be gone,
dead and buried.

1239
01:17:49,303 --> 01:17:52,824
If you came back, if
you survived at all...

1240
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:58,022
Look, Palmer, nobody's
saying this isn't dangerous.

1241
01:17:58,224 --> 01:18:00,304
The rest of the
candidates and myself

1242
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:02,222
understand the
risks we're taking.

1243
01:18:02,382 --> 01:18:03,302
Why?

1244
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:06,182
It's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...

1245
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:08,942
You, Ellie. You!
You personally.

1246
01:18:09,903 --> 01:18:12,581
By doing this, you're
willing to give your life.

1247
01:18:12,782 --> 01:18:14,862
You're willing to die for it.

1248
01:18:16,621 --> 01:18:17,780
Why?

1249
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:24,980
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...

1250
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,179
...something...

1251
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:29,031
...some reason why we're here.

1252
01:18:29,032 --> 01:18:31,021
What are we doing
here? Who are we?

1253
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:35,699
If this is a chance to find out
even a part of that answer...

1254
01:18:37,138 --> 01:18:40,019
I don't know, I think
it's worth a human life.

1255
01:18:40,698 --> 01:18:41,778
Don't you?

1256
01:18:48,377 --> 01:18:50,938
You're an incredibly
brave woman, Ellie.

1257
01:18:53,577 --> 01:18:55,376
Or incredibly nuts.

1258
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:25,653
I'm really confused.

1259
01:19:26,933 --> 01:19:28,132
So am I.

1260
01:19:29,293 --> 01:19:32,772
I think I speak for us all when
I thank you for your patience.

1261
01:19:33,013 --> 01:19:36,292
Myself, I have one final
question, Dr. Arroway.

1262
01:19:37,771 --> 01:19:39,971
If you should meet
these Vegans...

1263
01:19:40,171 --> 01:19:44,330
...and were permitted only
one question to ask of them...

1264
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:46,091
...what would it be?

1265
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:49,330
I suppose it would be:

1266
01:19:49,569 --> 01:19:51,170
"How did you do it?

1267
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:53,634
How did you evolve? How did you

1268
01:19:53,635 --> 01:19:55,969
survive technological
adolescence...

1269
01:19:56,128 --> 01:19:58,011
...without
destroying yourself?"

1270
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,998
That more than any
other question is

1271
01:20:00,999 --> 01:20:03,367
one I personally
would like answered.

1272
01:20:03,688 --> 01:20:05,447
Not too bad, Mike.

1273
01:20:06,128 --> 01:20:07,329
I join Dr. Bergeron...

1274
01:20:07,528 --> 01:20:10,848
...in expressing thanks for
your patience, Dr. Arroway.

1275
01:20:11,008 --> 01:20:13,447
We're all impressed
with your candor...

1276
01:20:13,769 --> 01:20:15,248
...and your stamina.

1277
01:20:15,688 --> 01:20:18,927
I think we're ready to move
on to your final statement.

1278
01:20:19,087 --> 01:20:20,927
I have one more question.

1279
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:22,607
Yes, Mr. Joss.

1280
01:20:26,445 --> 01:20:28,685
Would you consider yourself...

1281
01:20:29,165 --> 01:20:31,406
...a spiritual person?

1282
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:38,765
I don't understand the
point of the question.

1283
01:20:40,005 --> 01:20:42,723
I consider myself
a moral person.

1284
01:20:42,884 --> 01:20:44,957
We're sure that's the case, but

1285
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:47,364
what Mr. Joss is
in fact asking...

1286
01:20:47,484 --> 01:20:49,283
Do you believe in God?

1287
01:20:57,442 --> 01:20:59,522
As a scientist...

1288
01:20:59,842 --> 01:21:03,202
...I rely on empirical
evidence, and in this matter...

1289
01:21:03,482 --> 01:21:06,721
...I don't believe that
there's data either way.

1290
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:11,321
So your answer would in fact be
that you don't believe in God.

1291
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:17,961
I don't understand the
relevance of the question.

1292
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,680
95% of the world's
population...

1293
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:27,519
...believes in a Supreme
Being in one form or another.

1294
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,679
I believe that makes the
question more than relevant.

1295
01:21:45,477 --> 01:21:46,997
I believe...

1296
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,636
I believe I've already
answered that question.

1297
01:21:57,474 --> 01:22:00,756
I'm proud of what we've
achieved as a species...

1298
01:22:00,996 --> 01:22:02,916
...and as a civilization.

1299
01:22:04,474 --> 01:22:07,035
I would hate to see
everything we stand for...

1300
01:22:07,195 --> 01:22:10,834
...all that we have fought for
for a thousand generations...

1301
01:22:10,995 --> 01:22:13,273
...all that God has
blessed us with...

1302
01:22:14,595 --> 01:22:16,034
...betrayed...

1303
01:22:16,953 --> 01:22:19,087
...in the final
hour because we sent

1304
01:22:19,088 --> 01:22:21,392
a representative who
did not put our...

1305
01:22:21,913 --> 01:22:24,512
...most cherished
beliefs first.

1306
01:22:27,672 --> 01:22:28,791
Thank you.

1307
01:23:00,668 --> 01:23:01,949
Why'd you do it?

1308
01:23:06,347 --> 01:23:10,308
Our job was to select someone
to speak for everybody.

1309
01:23:13,587 --> 01:23:16,666
I couldn't in good conscience
vote for a person...

1310
01:23:16,946 --> 01:23:18,867
...who doesn't believe in God.

1311
01:23:20,827 --> 01:23:22,186
Someone who...

1312
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:25,585
...honestly thinks
the other 95% of us...

1313
01:23:25,785 --> 01:23:28,465
...suffer from some
form of mass delusion.

1314
01:23:31,664 --> 01:23:33,664
I told the truth up there.

1315
01:23:34,905 --> 01:23:38,225
Drumlin told you exactly
what you wanted to hear.

1316
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,499
With full humility
and utmost gratitude...

1317
01:24:14,701 --> 01:24:16,739
...I accept this great honor...

1318
01:24:16,941 --> 01:24:20,819
...and I promise I will do my
best to represent my nation...

1319
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:24,340
...my planet and my
God on this historic...

1320
01:24:24,498 --> 01:24:25,538
...journey.

1321
01:24:26,059 --> 01:24:28,298
I thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

1322
01:25:09,133 --> 01:25:12,013
There's a carnival atmosphere
at Cape Canaveral...

1323
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:14,213
...as the International
Machine Consortium...

1324
01:25:14,413 --> 01:25:17,612
...hosts as much a media
event as a systems test.

1325
01:25:18,054 --> 01:25:19,642
David Drumlin is supervising

1326
01:25:19,643 --> 01:25:21,571
the on-site
portion of the test.

1327
01:25:21,773 --> 01:25:23,531
We spoke with
him earlier today.

1328
01:25:23,812 --> 01:25:26,064
We'll be able to
monitor the stresses

1329
01:25:26,065 --> 01:25:28,491
and effects using
the robot passenger...

1330
01:25:28,972 --> 01:25:31,171
...who we lovingly call Elmer.

1331
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:39,050
The press wants to ask
you a few questions...

1332
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:41,809
...as soon as they're
done with Dr. Drumlin.

1333
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:46,619
When we release the
pod, a substantial

1334
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,769
amount of energy
will be generated.

1335
01:25:49,568 --> 01:25:52,049
We'll be able to monitor
the stresses and effects...

1336
01:25:52,289 --> 01:25:54,528
...using our robot
passenger, who we...

1337
01:25:54,808 --> 01:25:56,768
...lovingly call Elmer.

1338
01:25:57,368 --> 01:25:58,329
Thank you.

1339
01:25:58,568 --> 01:25:59,808
You're welcome.

1340
01:26:01,128 --> 01:26:03,328
They're ready for
you out at the site.

1341
01:26:03,967 --> 01:26:05,566
Yeah, just a minute.

1342
01:26:11,327 --> 01:26:13,565
- Congratulations.
- Glad you could come.

1343
01:26:14,887 --> 01:26:17,126
Didn't expect to see you here.

1344
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:19,645
Well, I'm still...

1345
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:22,526
...Crew Ops at
the Control Center.

1346
01:26:23,206 --> 01:26:25,220
I suppose the fact
that I discovered

1347
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,124
the message means
I have PR value.

1348
01:26:27,325 --> 01:26:28,605
Of course.

1349
01:26:30,325 --> 01:26:33,324
I know you must think
this is all very unfair.

1350
01:26:33,924 --> 01:26:35,803
And maybe that's
an understatement.

1351
01:26:37,244 --> 01:26:39,443
What you don't
know is, I agree.

1352
01:26:39,964 --> 01:26:41,368
I wish the world was a place

1353
01:26:41,369 --> 01:26:43,123
where fair was
the bottom line...

1354
01:26:43,283 --> 01:26:44,932
...where the
idealism you showed

1355
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,483
at the hearing was rewarded...

1356
01:26:46,722 --> 01:26:48,762
...not taken advantage of.

1357
01:26:50,443 --> 01:26:53,081
Unfortunately, we don't
live in that world.

1358
01:26:55,322 --> 01:26:56,402
Funny...

1359
01:26:57,762 --> 01:27:00,801
...I always believed the
world is what we make of it.

1360
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,521
Excuse me!

1361
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,760
Good luck on the test.

1362
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,561
Thank you.

1363
01:27:18,759 --> 01:27:19,759
Test director...

1364
01:27:19,959 --> 01:27:22,118
...everything looks
good. Ready to go.

1365
01:27:22,559 --> 01:27:25,519
I want things double
and triple checked here.

1366
01:27:25,717 --> 01:27:28,837
We only get one shot at
this. Let's get it right.

1367
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:32,238
Ladies and gentlemen, we
are ready for start-up.

1368
01:27:32,477 --> 01:27:35,677
All controllers, I need a
go-no-go for test initiation.

1369
01:27:35,797 --> 01:27:36,757
- Mechanical?
- Go.

1370
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:37,876
Electrical?

1371
01:27:38,036 --> 01:27:39,076
Dynamics?

1372
01:27:39,317 --> 01:27:40,436
Communications?

1373
01:27:40,597 --> 01:27:41,676
Pod systems?

1374
01:27:41,915 --> 01:27:43,037
Safety?

1375
01:27:43,477 --> 01:27:46,196
Crew Ops, verify all pre-test
procedures are complete.

1376
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:47,835
Yes, verified. I'm go.

1377
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:50,396
Pad Leader, is
everything okay with you?

1378
01:27:50,556 --> 01:27:53,076
Roger. The pad is a go.

1379
01:27:53,275 --> 01:27:55,955
Test initiation, on my mark.

1380
01:27:56,394 --> 01:27:57,555
5...

1381
01:27:57,913 --> 01:27:59,035
...4...

1382
01:27:59,434 --> 01:28:00,595
...3...

1383
01:28:00,793 --> 01:28:01,753
...2...

1384
01:28:02,314 --> 01:28:03,314
...1.

1385
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:04,913
Mark.

1386
01:28:05,433 --> 01:28:07,194
- Test start.
- Rings are unlocked.

1387
01:28:07,354 --> 01:28:08,833
Power levels show a good start.

1388
01:28:09,074 --> 01:28:10,753
We've begun the test of...

1389
01:28:10,993 --> 01:28:13,271
...earth's first
system built by sharing

1390
01:28:13,272 --> 01:28:15,273
knowledge with a
neighbor in space.

1391
01:28:15,472 --> 01:28:17,671
All power sources on
core induction bus.

1392
01:28:17,872 --> 01:28:19,512
IPV power transfer.

1393
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,712
Ring motion detect.
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.

1394
01:28:24,271 --> 01:28:27,191
- Gerry, how are we looking?
- Looks good. We're underway.

1395
01:28:27,352 --> 01:28:29,111
Looks like a normal start-up.

1396
01:28:29,271 --> 01:28:31,511
Roger, David. It's
looking good here.

1397
01:28:36,869 --> 01:28:38,352
We are moments away from the

1398
01:28:38,353 --> 01:28:40,149
initiation of
the drop sequence.

1399
01:28:40,309 --> 01:28:42,030
All systems are go.

1400
01:28:44,909 --> 01:28:46,630
- Mechanical, you still happy?
- Roger.

1401
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:48,029
It's very exciting...

1402
01:28:48,228 --> 01:28:49,747
...from up here.

1403
01:28:51,987 --> 01:28:53,669
We've got 4%.

1404
01:28:53,867 --> 01:28:55,588
We're confirming 4%.

1405
01:28:56,787 --> 01:28:59,308
Frequency 9.85.

1406
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:02,186
Harmonics in the green.

1407
01:29:02,428 --> 01:29:04,668
G-level 1.1.

1408
01:29:05,746 --> 01:29:08,986
- 5%.
- Confirmed. We are at 5%.

1409
01:29:09,225 --> 01:29:10,707
David, how's it looking to you?

1410
01:29:11,026 --> 01:29:13,866
Okay. I'm going to take a
look and show you what we got.

1411
01:29:14,066 --> 01:29:15,785
Instrumentation looks good.

1412
01:29:15,985 --> 01:29:19,306
We have a good picture
from Dr. Drumlin's PRD.

1413
01:29:19,825 --> 01:29:22,185
Hope you guys are
seeing what I'm seeing.

1414
01:29:22,665 --> 01:29:24,425
All systems are go.

1415
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:27,385
This is really something!

1416
01:29:27,585 --> 01:29:29,103
For purposes of this test...

1417
01:29:29,345 --> 01:29:31,377
...Dr. Drumlin will
be on top of the

1418
01:29:31,378 --> 01:29:33,463
Gantry crane that's
over the Machine.

1419
01:29:33,704 --> 01:29:35,624
We've got some
video animation...

1420
01:29:35,784 --> 01:29:37,673
...to show just
how this Machine...

1421
01:29:37,674 --> 01:29:39,142
it is thought... will work.

1422
01:29:39,383 --> 01:29:40,942
The passenger pod will release.

1423
01:29:41,143 --> 01:29:43,229
It will come down
through the center of

1424
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:45,263
the rings and into
the Machine's core.

1425
01:29:45,543 --> 01:29:47,781
The question everyone
here is asking is...

1426
01:29:47,981 --> 01:29:49,421
...what happens then?

1427
01:29:49,742 --> 01:29:52,010
Some believe the
rings function as some

1428
01:29:52,011 --> 01:29:54,221
sort of an accelerator
or something...

1429
01:29:54,981 --> 01:29:57,021
...sending its
energy into the pod...

1430
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,621
...making it rocket
away at near light speed.

1431
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,781
Others believe it might open up

1432
01:30:01,782 --> 01:30:04,060
a doorway to some
other dimension.

1433
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,379
Who's right?

1434
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,939
That's what today's
test is all about.

1435
01:30:08,339 --> 01:30:10,379
- 35%.
- Subsystems ready?

1436
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:12,419
40% normal acceleration.

1437
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:13,898
Confirm 40%.

1438
01:30:14,098 --> 01:30:16,939
Controllers stand by to
initiate drop sequence...

1439
01:30:17,098 --> 01:30:18,659
...on my mark.

1440
01:30:18,858 --> 01:30:20,898
All systems ready
for drop sequence.

1441
01:30:21,138 --> 01:30:22,659
45%.

1442
01:30:23,498 --> 01:30:25,538
We're in 45%.

1443
01:30:26,457 --> 01:30:28,417
Verify closure.

1444
01:30:29,698 --> 01:30:30,976
46.

1445
01:30:31,338 --> 01:30:33,775
All controllers
stand by to initiate

1446
01:30:33,776 --> 01:30:35,816
IPV drop sequence. On my mark.

1447
01:30:36,456 --> 01:30:37,736
48%.

1448
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:41,056
I'm feeling a very
strange vibration.

1449
01:30:41,497 --> 01:30:43,107
- Are you feeling
it down there?

1450
01:30:43,108 --> 01:30:44,376
- Gerry, can you confirm?

1451
01:30:44,935 --> 01:30:46,174
Everything looks good.

1452
01:30:46,855 --> 01:30:47,817
Crew Ops?

1453
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:48,855
Nothing wrong.

1454
01:30:49,015 --> 01:30:50,614
We see nothing abnormal here.

1455
01:30:50,816 --> 01:30:53,574
No good. Hold sequence.
I'll take a direct reading.

1456
01:30:54,013 --> 01:30:55,335
What's he talking about?

1457
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,134
Can anyone say grandstanding?

1458
01:30:57,415 --> 01:30:59,293
He sure knows he's on TV!

1459
01:30:59,534 --> 01:31:02,374
Back home that's what we
call an overcooked ham.

1460
01:31:02,814 --> 01:31:04,893
I'm reading 10 kilohertz!

1461
01:31:05,213 --> 01:31:07,892
What do you read on the first
and second order G-levels?

1462
01:31:08,092 --> 01:31:09,653
G-levels are right on!

1463
01:31:11,453 --> 01:31:14,212
We confirm Drumlin's
readings. All normal. We're go.

1464
01:31:15,452 --> 01:31:18,010
I think we're okay, but
we'll let him finish.

1465
01:31:19,292 --> 01:31:22,491
- Mechanical, you still okay?
- Roger. Right on the money.

1466
01:31:22,891 --> 01:31:24,050
Security problem!

1467
01:31:25,371 --> 01:31:26,970
Ellie, are you sure?

1468
01:31:27,531 --> 01:31:29,090
He shouldn't be
there. I know him.

1469
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:31,970
Gerry, execute the
rapid shutdown sequence.

1470
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:35,330
Security, move emergency
response team into position.

1471
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:37,290
Get Drumlin on a secure loop.

1472
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:38,850
You got him.

1473
01:31:39,049 --> 01:31:41,448
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, I hear.

1474
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:43,928
We've got a
security breach here.

1475
01:31:44,289 --> 01:31:45,208
Behind you.

1476
01:31:45,409 --> 01:31:46,288
The tall guy.

1477
01:31:46,688 --> 01:31:47,967
The technician.

1478
01:31:48,289 --> 01:31:49,368
See him?

1479
01:31:51,768 --> 01:31:52,928
He shouldn't be there.

1480
01:31:58,808 --> 01:32:00,127
Something's in his hand!

1481
01:32:01,246 --> 01:32:03,965
Him! Take him! Security breach!

1482
01:32:04,286 --> 01:32:05,086
A bomb!

1483
01:32:05,406 --> 01:32:08,606
I want that emergency response
team up on the gantry. Now!

1484
01:32:08,925 --> 01:32:09,886
Stage One Alert!

1485
01:32:10,045 --> 01:32:12,725
Move all fire and rescue
personnel into position one.

1486
01:32:49,402 --> 01:32:51,440
All right, back
to your stations.

1487
01:32:51,642 --> 01:32:54,601
I need you to be
professional. Settle down!

1488
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:57,200
Pad Leader, do you copy?

1489
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:16,838
The scene earlier today,
when David Drumlin...

1490
01:33:17,037 --> 01:33:18,838
...advisor to two Presidents...

1491
01:33:19,038 --> 01:33:20,589
...and winner of the National

1492
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:22,677
Academy of Sciences
lifetime award...

1493
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:26,558
...was laid to rest at
Arlington National Cemetery.

1494
01:33:30,236 --> 01:33:31,876
In a related story...

1495
01:33:32,116 --> 01:33:33,355
Can I help you?

1496
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:37,075
I've got some mail for you.

1497
01:33:37,516 --> 01:33:39,618
...the apparent
suicide note of the

1498
01:33:39,619 --> 01:33:41,836
terrorist now
believed responsible...

1499
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:44,875
...for the explosion
in Florida this week.

1500
01:33:45,235 --> 01:33:46,674
What we do...

1501
01:33:46,995 --> 01:33:49,834
...we do for the
goodness of all mankind.

1502
01:33:50,513 --> 01:33:53,234
This won't be
understood, not now...

1503
01:33:53,714 --> 01:33:55,313
...but the
Apocalypse to come...

1504
01:33:56,393 --> 01:33:58,512
...will vindicate our faith.

1505
01:34:21,831 --> 01:34:22,671
Welcome home.

1506
01:35:26,664 --> 01:35:28,063
Comrade Arroway...

1507
01:35:29,064 --> 01:35:32,302
...we have been expecting
your call. One moment, please.

1508
01:35:41,621 --> 01:35:42,782
Mr. Hadden?

1509
01:35:43,381 --> 01:35:44,621
Doctor!

1510
01:35:45,701 --> 01:35:47,461
How kind of you to call.

1511
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:50,021
Mr. Hadden, where are you?

1512
01:35:52,101 --> 01:35:54,493
The Russian government
was kind enough

1513
01:35:54,494 --> 01:35:56,580
to give me
accommodations on Mir.

1514
01:35:57,499 --> 01:35:59,299
You're living on
a space station?

1515
01:36:00,579 --> 01:36:02,459
It's quite simple, really.

1516
01:36:03,859 --> 01:36:07,178
The low oxygen, zero
gravity environment...

1517
01:36:07,419 --> 01:36:09,440
...is the only thing keeping

1518
01:36:09,441 --> 01:36:11,898
the cancer from
eating me alive.

1519
01:36:13,457 --> 01:36:16,017
Actually, I quite
like it up here.

1520
01:36:16,538 --> 01:36:19,576
My little room has
one hell of a view.

1521
01:36:27,376 --> 01:36:29,136
I want to show you something.

1522
01:36:33,575 --> 01:36:35,495
Hokkaido Island.

1523
01:36:36,815 --> 01:36:38,976
The systems integration site.

1524
01:36:39,975 --> 01:36:41,534
Look closer.

1525
01:36:49,493 --> 01:36:52,214
First rule in
government spending:

1526
01:36:53,133 --> 01:36:56,853
Why build one when you can
have two at twice the price?

1527
01:36:57,214 --> 01:37:00,093
Only, this one
can be kept secret.

1528
01:37:00,693 --> 01:37:02,612
Controlled by Americans...

1529
01:37:03,053 --> 01:37:06,251
...built by Japanese
subcontractors...

1530
01:37:07,172 --> 01:37:09,731
...who also happen to be...

1531
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:12,251
...recently acquired...

1532
01:37:12,771 --> 01:37:15,131
...wholly-owned
subsidiaries...

1533
01:37:15,931 --> 01:37:17,850
...of Hadden Industries.

1534
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:24,369
They still want an
American to go, Doctor.

1535
01:37:27,970 --> 01:37:29,528
Want to take a ride?

1536
01:38:10,403 --> 01:38:12,323
Augmenting our restraint and...

1537
01:38:12,564 --> 01:38:14,603
...communications
console subsystem...

1538
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:16,684
...is your personal
recording unit.

1539
01:38:16,964 --> 01:38:20,323
Normal, infrared and
ultraviolet lenses.

1540
01:38:20,963 --> 01:38:22,608
Digital microchip good for

1541
01:38:22,609 --> 01:38:24,763
thousands of
hours of recording.

1542
01:38:26,003 --> 01:38:28,082
Okay, look, I understand...

1543
01:38:28,322 --> 01:38:31,521
...the reason for recording
and documenting the mission.

1544
01:38:31,682 --> 01:38:34,162
But I just want to go
on record one more time.

1545
01:38:34,401 --> 01:38:35,888
The transmitted specs never

1546
01:38:35,889 --> 01:38:37,761
said anything
about any chair...

1547
01:38:38,001 --> 01:38:39,802
...or a restraining harness...

1548
01:38:40,002 --> 01:38:41,922
...or survival gear.

1549
01:38:42,601 --> 01:38:44,321
Why can't we just
trust the original...

1550
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,496
Doctor, both the
IMC Board and the

1551
01:38:46,497 --> 01:38:48,361
SI team reviewed
the material...

1552
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:51,919
...and concluded that the
design impact is negligible.

1553
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,759
Bottom line is...

1554
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,359
...we're not putting anyone
aboard this Machine...

1555
01:38:56,559 --> 01:38:59,439
...unless there is some
sort of minimal protection.

1556
01:38:59,759 --> 01:39:01,038
End of story.

1557
01:39:07,757 --> 01:39:09,625
We've given these
to the astronauts

1558
01:39:09,626 --> 01:39:11,598
since the start of
the space program.

1559
01:39:12,877 --> 01:39:15,077
It's never been made
public, of course.

1560
01:39:15,277 --> 01:39:17,277
It's fast and it's painless.

1561
01:39:19,917 --> 01:39:22,797
I'm going to travel 26 light
years to commit suicide?

1562
01:39:23,036 --> 01:39:24,635
Something may go wrong.

1563
01:39:25,196 --> 01:39:27,756
There may be an unforeseen
mechanical failure.

1564
01:39:28,476 --> 01:39:31,435
You could be marooned,
unable to return.

1565
01:39:32,554 --> 01:39:35,555
There are 1,000 reasons we
can think of to have this...

1566
01:39:35,755 --> 01:39:38,555
...but mostly it's for the
reasons we can't think of.

1567
01:40:03,991 --> 01:40:05,111
Come in.

1568
01:40:06,551 --> 01:40:08,791
Dr. Arroway, time to get ready.

1569
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:09,991
Thank you.

1570
01:40:20,629 --> 01:40:22,310
I know there's not much time.

1571
01:40:22,468 --> 01:40:25,390
As soon as I found out about
it, I called the President.

1572
01:40:25,589 --> 01:40:27,189
I came with Kitz.

1573
01:40:27,748 --> 01:40:29,908
I had to see you one more time.

1574
01:40:30,147 --> 01:40:31,749
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1575
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:33,828
No, I'm glad you came.

1576
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:36,228
There's something
I got to say to you.

1577
01:40:37,508 --> 01:40:39,404
The reason I
didn't vote for you

1578
01:40:39,405 --> 01:40:41,587
was a good one, but
not the real one.

1579
01:40:42,627 --> 01:40:44,546
I didn't vote for you to go...

1580
01:40:46,347 --> 01:40:48,107
...because I don't
want to lose you.

1581
01:40:49,188 --> 01:40:51,265
Now you find your
way home, all right?

1582
01:41:07,544 --> 01:41:08,904
23 hours ago, the world...

1583
01:41:09,144 --> 01:41:10,999
...was stunned by
the announcement

1584
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,064
of the existence of
another Machine...

1585
01:41:13,264 --> 01:41:16,103
...and its passenger,
Eleanor Ann Arroway.

1586
01:41:16,304 --> 01:41:16,863
Now...

1587
01:41:17,462 --> 01:41:19,784
...the question that's
on everyone's mind:

1588
01:41:19,983 --> 01:41:21,662
Will history repeat itself?

1589
01:41:22,063 --> 01:41:24,303
With a piece of
engineering this complex...

1590
01:41:24,462 --> 01:41:28,342
...with so many unknowns,
could the unthinkable occur?

1591
01:41:28,542 --> 01:41:31,741
The security in Hokkaido
has been incredibly tight.

1592
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:35,142
No reporters whatsoever have
been allowed near the site.

1593
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:11,963
Restraint secure. Life
support functions normal.

1594
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:13,003
Roger.

1595
01:44:13,203 --> 01:44:15,122
This is Control. Do you copy?

1596
01:44:15,324 --> 01:44:16,763
Reading you
five-by-five.

1597
01:44:17,762 --> 01:44:19,122
Give me Ellie's PRD.

1598
01:44:19,362 --> 01:44:21,282
Video unit recording
and transmitting.

1599
01:44:22,603 --> 01:44:25,081
- Are you reading me?
- That's affirmative.

1600
01:44:25,282 --> 01:44:26,881
Video looks good.

1601
01:44:27,682 --> 01:44:28,761
Copy, Control.

1602
01:44:30,121 --> 01:44:32,801
Ellie, we're going to
proceed to button you up.

1603
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:35,720
I'm ready.

1604
01:44:39,401 --> 01:44:41,200
Confirming walkway retraction.

1605
01:44:41,879 --> 01:44:43,240
- Communications?
- Go.

1606
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,319
- Life support?
- Go.

1607
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:46,999
We are go for closure.

1608
01:44:49,319 --> 01:44:50,879
I'm go here.

1609
01:44:51,918 --> 01:44:55,279
Mechanical, initiate
IPV closure sequence.

1610
01:44:56,879 --> 01:44:58,478
Let me get you a chair.

1611
01:45:00,837 --> 01:45:03,374
- It's nice to smell
you again, Mr. Kitz.

1612
01:45:03,375 --> 01:45:04,037
- You too.

1613
01:45:04,757 --> 01:45:06,517
Wouldn't peg him as a Polo man.

1614
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:16,914
I got a visual on the door.

1615
01:45:19,235 --> 01:45:20,996
The door is looking good.

1616
01:45:26,034 --> 01:45:27,635
Door alignment looks good.

1617
01:45:55,631 --> 01:45:57,071
We're green across the board.

1618
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:59,751
Copy that, Control.
IPV is secure.

1619
01:46:07,269 --> 01:46:08,870
We are at 30%.

1620
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:10,590
Copy that, 30%.

1621
01:46:15,228 --> 01:46:16,669
How you doing in there?

1622
01:46:17,109 --> 01:46:17,829
Kent?

1623
01:46:18,669 --> 01:46:19,389
Is that you?

1624
01:46:19,789 --> 01:46:21,308
That's a big affirmative.

1625
01:46:22,108 --> 01:46:23,589
Who let you in there?

1626
01:46:23,908 --> 01:46:25,829
A higher power intervened.

1627
01:46:27,789 --> 01:46:29,147
I'm glad you came.

1628
01:46:33,587 --> 01:46:34,787
35%.

1629
01:46:35,467 --> 01:46:36,787
Copy that, 35%.

1630
01:46:37,066 --> 01:46:38,426
- Mechanical?
- We're good.

1631
01:46:38,627 --> 01:46:39,946
40%.

1632
01:46:43,266 --> 01:46:45,145
I'm picking up a
moderate vibration.

1633
01:46:46,345 --> 01:46:48,265
Dynamics, can you
confirm vibration?

1634
01:46:48,466 --> 01:46:49,666
It looks good here.

1635
01:46:49,866 --> 01:46:52,904
She's feeling the same
thing they felt at the Cape.

1636
01:46:53,104 --> 01:46:54,145
Vibration's normal.

1637
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:57,145
We are at 50%. All
systems nominal.

1638
01:46:57,384 --> 01:46:59,144
Copy that, 50%.

1639
01:47:04,384 --> 01:47:06,183
Vibration's a
little stronger now.

1640
01:47:06,503 --> 01:47:08,743
We're picking up some
low frequency noise.

1641
01:47:09,543 --> 01:47:10,942
Mechanical, confirm?

1642
01:47:11,142 --> 01:47:12,543
It looks fine to me.

1643
01:47:12,743 --> 01:47:14,782
Roger. Jerry,
what do you think?

1644
01:47:14,982 --> 01:47:15,783
I'm still go.

1645
01:47:16,062 --> 01:47:17,502
People, we are still go.

1646
01:47:20,222 --> 01:47:21,662
Something's happening.

1647
01:47:25,541 --> 01:47:26,980
You see that light?

1648
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:28,221
I'm seeing...

1649
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:33,220
I can't tell if it's daylight.

1650
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:36,420
There it is again. It's
coming from the bottom.

1651
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,339
Let me show you. See that?

1652
01:47:39,579 --> 01:47:41,659
Negative. You're breaking up.

1653
01:47:42,018 --> 01:47:44,059
- Can we boost signal?
- It's at maximum.

1654
01:47:44,539 --> 01:47:45,779
65%.

1655
01:47:45,979 --> 01:47:47,578
The material is changing.

1656
01:47:47,778 --> 01:47:51,097
It's bordering on translucence.
The system's intact.

1657
01:47:54,297 --> 01:47:55,777
It has to be...

1658
01:47:55,978 --> 01:47:58,417
...some kind of
electromagnetic field.

1659
01:47:58,656 --> 01:47:59,658
Do you read this?

1660
01:47:59,898 --> 01:48:01,818
We see only interference.

1661
01:48:01,858 --> 01:48:03,296
It's becoming translucent.

1662
01:48:04,136 --> 01:48:06,536
I can't describe it. I
can't even explain it!

1663
01:48:09,216 --> 01:48:10,135
70%.

1664
01:48:10,335 --> 01:48:12,576
We have intermittent
comm, but we are go!

1665
01:48:12,896 --> 01:48:14,815
Initiate secondary
drive systems.

1666
01:48:15,015 --> 01:48:17,015
Initiating auxiliary
booster sequence.

1667
01:48:17,215 --> 01:48:18,695
We're go for ignition.

1668
01:48:25,735 --> 01:48:27,254
We have auxiliary ignition.

1669
01:48:33,533 --> 01:48:34,973
Life support, how is she?

1670
01:48:35,133 --> 01:48:37,892
Heart and respiration are
high but within limits.

1671
01:48:38,172 --> 01:48:39,452
Ellie, do you copy?

1672
01:48:39,693 --> 01:48:40,613
If you hear...

1673
01:48:40,732 --> 01:48:42,573
...I am okay to go.

1674
01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:52,091
80%.

1675
01:48:52,331 --> 01:48:55,050
All vibration and
G-levels are in the green.

1676
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:02,370
Control, if you're
reading me...

1677
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:04,770
...I am okay to go! Okay to go!

1678
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:06,010
85%.

1679
01:49:06,169 --> 01:49:07,529
All tips are on the profile.

1680
01:49:09,689 --> 01:49:12,569
90%. We're detecting some
structural instability.

1681
01:49:13,648 --> 01:49:16,408
- Is she holding?
- We're within limits, barely.

1682
01:49:17,848 --> 01:49:19,729
I'm okay to go!

1683
01:49:21,648 --> 01:49:23,247
I'm okay to go!

1684
01:49:29,247 --> 01:49:30,647
My God!

1685
01:49:41,204 --> 01:49:42,565
Okay to go!

1686
01:49:42,724 --> 01:49:43,726
I'm okay!

1687
01:49:44,006 --> 01:49:45,446
100% target velocity.

1688
01:49:46,925 --> 01:49:49,119
Tremendous EMI
levels around Machine!

1689
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:51,083
Field measurements
are off-scale.

1690
01:49:51,284 --> 01:49:53,525
We're approaching
our abort limits.

1691
01:49:55,924 --> 01:49:57,004
Okay to go.

1692
01:50:01,964 --> 01:50:02,763
I hear her!

1693
01:50:03,283 --> 01:50:06,081
I hear her. Barely,
but she's there.

1694
01:50:06,322 --> 01:50:07,441
Okay to go.

1695
01:50:07,804 --> 01:50:09,123
Says she's okay to go.

1696
01:50:12,043 --> 01:50:13,802
Steve, we're real close.

1697
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:15,114
- Your core reading?

1698
01:50:15,115 --> 01:50:17,001
- Internal environment
looks normal.

1699
01:50:17,362 --> 01:50:19,962
Inside the core, the
weather's beautiful.

1700
01:50:23,881 --> 01:50:25,120
I'm okay to go.

1701
01:50:27,521 --> 01:50:28,921
I'm okay to go.

1702
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,719
Initiate drop sequence.

1703
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:35,839
On my mark.

1704
01:50:36,439 --> 01:50:37,399
10...

1705
01:50:37,919 --> 01:50:38,920
...9...

1706
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:40,839
...8...

1707
01:50:42,318 --> 01:50:43,279
...7...

1708
01:50:43,638 --> 01:50:44,598
...6...

1709
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:46,157
...5...

1710
01:50:46,438 --> 01:50:47,397
...4...

1711
01:50:47,919 --> 01:50:48,478
...3...

1712
01:50:49,398 --> 01:50:50,318
...2...

1713
01:50:50,517 --> 01:50:51,557
I'm okay to go.

1714
01:50:55,678 --> 01:50:57,277
Oh, God!

1715
01:51:06,435 --> 01:51:07,996
Ellie to Control.

1716
01:51:08,715 --> 01:51:11,075
Ellie to Control,
do you read me!

1717
01:51:15,554 --> 01:51:17,794
Ellie to Control,
do you read me!

1718
01:51:23,754 --> 01:51:24,834
I'll try...

1719
01:51:25,593 --> 01:51:26,994
...to keep recording!

1720
01:51:27,755 --> 01:51:29,313
I'm going through...

1721
01:51:29,513 --> 01:51:31,433
...some kind of a tunnel!

1722
01:51:46,231 --> 01:51:47,711
There's a light source ahead!

1723
01:51:48,311 --> 01:51:49,350
Brilliant...

1724
01:51:49,551 --> 01:51:50,870
...blue-white.

1725
01:51:52,471 --> 01:51:53,991
Residual radiation?

1726
01:52:05,228 --> 01:52:06,468
It's a star.

1727
01:52:07,029 --> 01:52:08,109
I must have...

1728
01:52:08,869 --> 01:52:10,308
...gone through a wormhole.

1729
01:52:15,267 --> 01:52:16,549
It's Vega!

1730
01:52:27,266 --> 01:52:28,946
I'm in another wormhole now!

1731
01:52:32,467 --> 01:52:33,506
I had no idea!

1732
01:52:33,745 --> 01:52:35,265
A series of them!

1733
01:52:38,106 --> 01:52:39,186
They're alive.

1734
01:52:39,465 --> 01:52:40,546
It's like...

1735
01:52:40,946 --> 01:52:43,264
...some kind of
a transit system.

1736
01:52:44,225 --> 01:52:45,543
A subway!

1737
01:52:45,704 --> 01:52:47,024
Oh, God!

1738
01:52:52,543 --> 01:52:54,383
I have to keep talking.

1739
01:52:57,343 --> 01:52:58,582
It's a triple...

1740
01:52:58,784 --> 01:53:00,943
...no, a quadruple system.

1741
01:53:01,462 --> 01:53:02,502
Beautiful!

1742
01:53:05,702 --> 01:53:06,903
They're alive!

1743
01:53:14,862 --> 01:53:16,501
Another wormhole!

1744
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:18,541
This one's much more violent!

1745
01:54:48,331 --> 01:54:49,291
Some...

1746
01:54:50,650 --> 01:54:52,249
...celestial event...

1747
01:54:53,649 --> 01:54:54,609
No!

1748
01:54:55,449 --> 01:54:57,010
No words!

1749
01:54:57,371 --> 01:54:58,969
No words...

1750
01:55:00,569 --> 01:55:02,169
...to describe it!

1751
01:55:04,209 --> 01:55:05,649
Poetry!

1752
01:55:07,088 --> 01:55:08,567
They should have sent...

1753
01:55:09,209 --> 01:55:10,328
...a poet.

1754
01:55:10,807 --> 01:55:12,249
It's so beautiful!

1755
01:55:13,488 --> 01:55:14,647
Beautiful!

1756
01:55:16,408 --> 01:55:18,167
So beautiful.

1757
01:55:22,486 --> 01:55:24,886
I had no idea.

1758
01:57:57,868 --> 01:57:59,108
Hi, Sparks.

1759
01:58:00,909 --> 01:58:01,869
Dad?

1760
01:58:09,508 --> 01:58:11,108
I missed you.

1761
01:58:16,868 --> 01:58:17,827
Aren't you...?

1762
01:58:17,986 --> 01:58:20,706
I'm sorry I couldn't be
there for you, sweetheart.

1763
01:58:30,465 --> 01:58:31,784
You're not real.

1764
01:58:33,705 --> 01:58:35,105
None of this is real!

1765
01:58:35,305 --> 01:58:36,984
That's my scientist.

1766
01:58:38,304 --> 01:58:40,014
When I was unconscious, you

1767
01:58:40,015 --> 01:58:42,424
downloaded my
thoughts, my memories.

1768
01:58:43,384 --> 01:58:44,704
Pensacola!

1769
01:58:47,782 --> 01:58:50,143
We thought it might make
things easier for you.

1770
01:59:03,421 --> 01:59:04,781
Why did you contact us?

1771
01:59:04,982 --> 01:59:06,622
You contacted us.

1772
01:59:07,101 --> 01:59:08,662
We were just listening.

1773
01:59:09,461 --> 01:59:10,740
There are others?

1774
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:12,140
Many others.

1775
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:18,260
They all...

1776
01:59:18,699 --> 01:59:21,700
...travel here through that
transit system you built?

1777
01:59:22,219 --> 01:59:23,619
We didn't build it.

1778
01:59:24,739 --> 01:59:26,219
We don't know who did.

1779
01:59:28,219 --> 01:59:30,778
They were gone long
before we ever got here.

1780
01:59:31,658 --> 01:59:33,418
Maybe someday
they'll come back.

1781
01:59:34,377 --> 01:59:36,777
All the civilizations
you find come here?

1782
01:59:36,978 --> 01:59:38,217
Not all.

1783
01:59:39,897 --> 01:59:42,936
- Is this some test?
- No, no test.

1784
01:59:45,737 --> 01:59:47,217
You have your mother's hands.

1785
01:59:57,014 --> 01:59:59,094
You're an
interesting species...

1786
01:59:59,734 --> 02:00:01,295
...an interesting mix.

1787
02:00:02,535 --> 02:00:05,174
You're capable of such
beautiful dreams...

1788
02:00:06,175 --> 02:00:08,213
...and such
horrible nightmares.

1789
02:00:09,614 --> 02:00:11,374
You feel so lost...

1790
02:00:12,133 --> 02:00:14,533
...so cut off, so alone.

1791
02:00:16,172 --> 02:00:17,493
Only you're not.

1792
02:00:21,772 --> 02:00:23,371
In all our searching...

1793
02:00:23,573 --> 02:00:26,372
...all we've found that makes
the emptiness bearable...

1794
02:00:27,091 --> 02:00:28,411
...is each other.

1795
02:00:32,211 --> 02:00:33,811
What happens now?

1796
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:36,131
Now?

1797
02:00:37,411 --> 02:00:38,850
You go home.

1798
02:00:39,330 --> 02:00:40,371
Home?

1799
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:41,890
But...

1800
02:00:42,370 --> 02:00:43,770
...I have so many questions.

1801
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:45,730
Do we get to come back?

1802
02:00:46,808 --> 02:00:48,570
This was just a first step.

1803
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:50,809
In time, you'll take another.

1804
02:00:52,329 --> 02:00:54,768
But other people need
to see what I've seen...

1805
02:00:54,968 --> 02:00:57,849
This is the way it's been
done for billions of years.

1806
02:01:00,128 --> 02:01:01,728
Small moves, Ellie.

1807
02:01:03,487 --> 02:01:05,088
Small moves.

1808
02:01:46,842 --> 02:01:48,402
We've got video on Ellie!

1809
02:01:48,603 --> 02:01:50,482
She's through!
She is in the net.

1810
02:01:50,682 --> 02:01:53,002
She's alive. Get the
President on the phone!

1811
02:01:53,762 --> 02:01:55,202
What's going on? How is she?

1812
02:01:56,041 --> 02:01:57,681
Ellie, this is
Control. You copy?

1813
02:01:57,881 --> 02:01:59,281
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1814
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,521
- She's alive.
- Put her on P.A.

1815
02:02:01,721 --> 02:02:03,240
Ellie, hold on tight.

1816
02:02:03,801 --> 02:02:05,326
We're still trying to determine

1817
02:02:05,327 --> 02:02:07,000
the nature of
the malfunction...

1818
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:09,640
...but the important
thing is you're okay.

1819
02:02:09,881 --> 02:02:10,841
What?

1820
02:02:11,159 --> 02:02:12,560
It's all right.

1821
02:02:12,761 --> 02:02:14,599
The important thing
is you're safe.

1822
02:02:15,559 --> 02:02:17,240
What malfunction?

1823
02:02:21,519 --> 02:02:22,798
What happened?

1824
02:02:24,357 --> 02:02:25,798
What day is this?

1825
02:02:26,599 --> 02:02:27,518
I'm sorry.

1826
02:02:27,718 --> 02:02:29,157
Did you say what day?

1827
02:02:30,678 --> 02:02:32,197
How long was I gone?

1828
02:02:34,357 --> 02:02:38,357
The IPV dropped straight
through the Machine.

1829
02:02:39,236 --> 02:02:40,916
You didn't go anywhere.

1830
02:02:41,637 --> 02:02:42,916
But I did.

1831
02:02:43,156 --> 02:02:44,436
I did go.

1832
02:02:44,916 --> 02:02:46,996
That's what I've
tried to tell everyone.

1833
02:02:51,475 --> 02:02:53,954
But the headset didn't
record a single image?

1834
02:02:54,594 --> 02:02:55,875
Just this.

1835
02:02:56,113 --> 02:02:57,114
Static.

1836
02:02:57,315 --> 02:02:58,275
Thank you.

1837
02:02:59,635 --> 02:03:01,313
Let me show you what we saw.

1838
02:03:10,913 --> 02:03:14,433
43 separate remote cameras
show exactly the same event.

1839
02:03:14,673 --> 02:03:16,062
The IPV dropped straight

1840
02:03:16,063 --> 02:03:18,032
through. Everyone
saw exactly...

1841
02:03:18,352 --> 02:03:19,632
...the same thing.

1842
02:03:20,031 --> 02:03:21,392
Nothing happened.

1843
02:03:22,991 --> 02:03:24,912
How do you explain
this, Doctor?

1844
02:03:27,071 --> 02:03:28,150
I can't.

1845
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:29,791
I'd encourage you...

1846
02:03:31,472 --> 02:03:33,591
...not to inflame
this situation...

1847
02:03:33,791 --> 02:03:35,510
...beyond the facts.

1848
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:38,790
Let us deal with
this on the facts.

1849
02:03:39,069 --> 02:03:41,870
We are monitoring what
has actually happened.

1850
02:03:42,109 --> 02:03:45,029
We are taking what we
believe are factually...

1851
02:03:45,270 --> 02:03:47,189
...appropriate steps.

1852
02:03:47,429 --> 02:03:50,349
Amid a flurry of accusations
and counter-accusations...

1853
02:03:50,549 --> 02:03:53,068
...by the nations representing
the Machine Consortium...

1854
02:03:53,269 --> 02:03:55,987
...the President has
ordered a special inquiry.

1855
02:03:56,188 --> 02:03:58,868
But the appointment to the
committee of Michael Kitz...

1856
02:03:59,067 --> 02:04:01,788
...who has resigned as
National Security Advisor...

1857
02:04:01,987 --> 02:04:04,347
...has raised eyebrows
on Capitol Hill.

1858
02:04:04,546 --> 02:04:06,312
I have made no
decision to run for

1859
02:04:06,313 --> 02:04:08,026
Congress, announced
no candidacy.

1860
02:04:08,265 --> 02:04:11,467
I resigned as National
Security Advisor...

1861
02:04:11,627 --> 02:04:15,625
...in order to devote all
of my energy to this inquiry.

1862
02:04:16,344 --> 02:04:18,369
The people of the world have a

1863
02:04:18,370 --> 02:04:20,864
right to know what
really happened.

1864
02:04:21,625 --> 02:04:24,144
Yet every scientific
instrument confirms...

1865
02:04:24,344 --> 02:04:26,112
...the IPV was out of contact

1866
02:04:26,113 --> 02:04:28,184
for only a fraction
of a second.

1867
02:04:28,385 --> 02:04:30,103
Isn't that correct, Doctor?

1868
02:04:31,944 --> 02:04:34,183
A fraction of a
second Earth time, yes.

1869
02:04:35,023 --> 02:04:36,263
Earth time?

1870
02:04:36,503 --> 02:04:39,863
Senator, I believe that the
Machine opened up a wormhole...

1871
02:04:40,182 --> 02:04:42,453
...a tunnel through
space-time, also

1872
02:04:42,454 --> 02:04:44,662
known as an
Einstein-Rossen Bridge.

1873
02:04:44,903 --> 02:04:47,110
Due to the effect of
general relativity,

1874
02:04:47,111 --> 02:04:48,943
what I experienced
as 18 hours...

1875
02:04:49,181 --> 02:04:51,302
...passed
instantaneously on Earth.

1876
02:04:51,542 --> 02:04:53,540
Isn't it true
these wormholes are

1877
02:04:53,541 --> 02:04:55,420
merely theoretical predictions?

1878
02:04:55,781 --> 02:04:58,341
There is no evidence
they actually exist?

1879
02:04:58,541 --> 02:05:00,220
There is no direct
evidence, no.

1880
02:05:00,421 --> 02:05:01,540
Tell me...

1881
02:05:02,059 --> 02:05:04,900
...why would these aliens
go to all this trouble?

1882
02:05:05,381 --> 02:05:07,395
Bring you thousands
of light years,

1883
02:05:07,396 --> 02:05:09,299
then send you
home without proof?

1884
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:12,620
They said it's how it's been
done for billions of years.

1885
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:16,299
You have no proof because they
didn't want you to have any.

1886
02:05:16,578 --> 02:05:18,654
A phenomenon known
in psychiatric

1887
02:05:18,655 --> 02:05:21,098
circles as a
self-reinforcing delusion.

1888
02:05:21,739 --> 02:05:23,137
You think I was delusional?

1889
02:05:23,338 --> 02:05:25,251
I do think you
may have suffered

1890
02:05:25,252 --> 02:05:27,337
some kind of an
episode. Yes, I do.

1891
02:05:27,577 --> 02:05:30,257
I'd like to propose an
alternate hypothesis...

1892
02:05:30,457 --> 02:05:32,166
...and I'd like
you to bring your

1893
02:05:32,167 --> 02:05:33,977
scientific expertise
to bear on it.

1894
02:05:34,216 --> 02:05:37,057
To fake a signal from Vega...

1895
02:05:37,857 --> 02:05:39,096
...what would you need?

1896
02:05:40,976 --> 02:05:42,705
You'd need a
satellite to transmit

1897
02:05:42,706 --> 02:05:44,534
it, but it would
be impossible to...

1898
02:05:44,736 --> 02:05:46,382
You'd need a satellite and

1899
02:05:46,383 --> 02:05:48,535
launch capabilities
to orbit it.

1900
02:05:48,735 --> 02:05:51,935
And the message itself. To put
something like this together...

1901
02:05:52,055 --> 02:05:54,294
...so complex, drawing
on many disciplines...

1902
02:05:54,495 --> 02:05:55,774
Would be impossible.

1903
02:05:57,534 --> 02:05:58,933
Impossible?

1904
02:05:59,454 --> 02:06:02,294
Is there anyone who might
have been up to the challenge?

1905
02:06:03,133 --> 02:06:05,493
Someone with extraordinary
technical expertise...

1906
02:06:05,813 --> 02:06:07,732
...enormous
financial resources...

1907
02:06:08,132 --> 02:06:10,231
...someone perverse
enough, eccentric

1908
02:06:10,232 --> 02:06:12,053
enough to come
up with the idea?

1909
02:06:13,692 --> 02:06:14,452
Hadden?

1910
02:06:15,492 --> 02:06:17,372
S. R. Hadden.

1911
02:06:21,812 --> 02:06:23,370
You're implying
that this was...

1912
02:06:23,610 --> 02:06:25,971
...some kind of a hoax?
That he engineered this?

1913
02:06:26,171 --> 02:06:27,490
S. R. Hadden...

1914
02:06:27,771 --> 02:06:29,672
...a legendary power broker in

1915
02:06:29,673 --> 02:06:32,209
perhaps his final
bid for immortality.

1916
02:06:32,409 --> 02:06:35,050
Maybe he wanted to
exploit new technologies...

1917
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:37,249
...having world
governments pick up the tab.

1918
02:06:37,449 --> 02:06:40,089
Perhaps this was his
final altruistic gesture...

1919
02:06:40,368 --> 02:06:41,876
...to unite the world in some

1920
02:06:41,877 --> 02:06:43,849
common goal. Maybe
all of the above.

1921
02:06:44,208 --> 02:06:46,288
S. R. Hadden, a brilliant...

1922
02:06:46,808 --> 02:06:48,487
...and complicated man.

1923
02:06:51,207 --> 02:06:54,848
Doctor, are you familiar
with the scientific precept...

1924
02:06:55,487 --> 02:06:57,568
...known as Occam's Razor?

1925
02:07:03,446 --> 02:07:04,566
Yes.

1926
02:07:06,486 --> 02:07:08,631
It means the
simplest explanation

1927
02:07:08,632 --> 02:07:10,965
generally tends to
be the right one.

1928
02:07:11,125 --> 02:07:12,205
Exactly.

1929
02:07:12,846 --> 02:07:15,285
You tell me. What
is more likely here?

1930
02:07:15,484 --> 02:07:18,645
A message from aliens results
in a magical machine...

1931
02:07:18,845 --> 02:07:21,445
...that whisks you to the
center of the galaxy...

1932
02:07:21,685 --> 02:07:24,404
...to windsurf with Dad
and a split second later...

1933
02:07:24,564 --> 02:07:27,924
...returns you home without
a single shred of proof?

1934
02:07:28,362 --> 02:07:31,643
Or that your experience
is the result of being...

1935
02:07:31,884 --> 02:07:35,123
...the unwitting star in the
farewell performance of one...

1936
02:07:35,283 --> 02:07:36,203
...S.R. Hadden?

1937
02:07:36,402 --> 02:07:39,963
A man with the means and motive
to play you and all of us...

1938
02:07:40,162 --> 02:07:42,323
...as pawns in
the most elaborate,

1939
02:07:42,324 --> 02:07:44,361
most expensive
hoax of all time?

1940
02:07:49,122 --> 02:07:52,640
You come to us with no
evidence, no records...

1941
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:55,001
...no artifacts...

1942
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:59,359
...only a story that, to put
it mildly, strains credibility.

1943
02:08:00,599 --> 02:08:03,440
Over half a trillion
dollars were spent.

1944
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:06,160
Dozens of lives were lost.

1945
02:08:07,199 --> 02:08:09,329
Are you going to
sit there and tell

1946
02:08:09,329 --> 02:08:11,399
us we should just
take this all...

1947
02:08:12,399 --> 02:08:13,798
...on faith?

1948
02:08:17,638 --> 02:08:19,557
Please answer the
question, Doctor.

1949
02:08:23,517 --> 02:08:25,638
Is it possible that
it didn't happen?

1950
02:08:25,837 --> 02:08:26,877
Yes.

1951
02:08:29,596 --> 02:08:32,595
As a scientist I must concede
that. I must volunteer that.

1952
02:08:36,956 --> 02:08:38,196
Let me get this straight.

1953
02:08:38,636 --> 02:08:42,435
You admit you have no physical
evidence to back up your story?

1954
02:08:42,915 --> 02:08:43,795
Yes.

1955
02:08:43,995 --> 02:08:46,915
You admit you may have
hallucinated this whole thing?

1956
02:08:47,634 --> 02:08:49,875
You admit if you were
in our position...

1957
02:08:50,075 --> 02:08:53,474
...you would be as incredulous
and skeptical as we?

1958
02:08:54,954 --> 02:08:57,000
Then why don't
you simply withdraw

1959
02:08:57,001 --> 02:08:58,753
your testimony and concede...

1960
02:08:59,034 --> 02:09:01,081
...that this
journey to the center

1961
02:09:01,082 --> 02:09:02,953
of the galaxy never took place?

1962
02:09:05,833 --> 02:09:07,592
Because I can't.

1963
02:09:14,231 --> 02:09:16,791
I had an experience.

1964
02:09:19,111 --> 02:09:21,631
I can't prove it. I
can't even explain it.

1965
02:09:21,831 --> 02:09:24,670
But everything I know as a
human being, everything I am...

1966
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:26,910
...tells me it was real.

1967
02:09:29,231 --> 02:09:30,860
I was given
something wonderful,

1968
02:09:30,861 --> 02:09:32,590
something that
changed me forever.

1969
02:09:32,869 --> 02:09:33,828
A vision...

1970
02:09:34,469 --> 02:09:36,028
...of the universe...

1971
02:09:36,708 --> 02:09:38,788
...that tells us undeniably...

1972
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:41,508
...how tiny and
insignificant...

1973
02:09:41,668 --> 02:09:45,149
...and how rare and
precious we all are.

1974
02:09:46,268 --> 02:09:49,188
A vision that tells us that
we belong to something...

1975
02:09:49,467 --> 02:09:51,995
...that is greater
than ourselves,

1976
02:09:51,996 --> 02:09:53,948
that none of us are alone.

1977
02:09:58,626 --> 02:10:01,506
I wish I could share that.

1978
02:10:04,866 --> 02:10:05,986
I wish...

1979
02:10:07,545 --> 02:10:09,945
...that everyone,
if even for one...

1980
02:10:10,266 --> 02:10:11,385
...moment...

1981
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:12,865
...could feel...

1982
02:10:13,306 --> 02:10:16,185
...that awe and
humility and hope.

1983
02:10:25,184 --> 02:10:27,384
That continues to be my wish.

1984
02:11:06,939 --> 02:11:09,420
Dr. Arroway, can I
get a picture, please.

1985
02:11:49,734 --> 02:11:50,814
Reverend Joss!

1986
02:11:51,013 --> 02:11:52,573
What do you believe?!

1987
02:11:58,253 --> 02:12:00,172
As a person of
faith, I'm bound by a

1988
02:12:00,173 --> 02:12:02,092
different covenant
than Dr. Arroway.

1989
02:12:03,772 --> 02:12:05,931
But our goal is
one and the same.

1990
02:12:06,452 --> 02:12:08,011
The pursuit of truth.

1991
02:12:11,372 --> 02:12:12,650
I, for one, believe her.

1992
02:12:35,209 --> 02:12:38,008
So what happens now?
We give her a medal?

1993
02:12:38,409 --> 02:12:40,727
I'd say at least
a healthy grant.

1994
02:12:41,089 --> 02:12:42,703
You read the
confidential report

1995
02:12:42,704 --> 02:12:44,368
from the investigating
committee?

1996
02:12:44,567 --> 02:12:45,927
I flipped through it.

1997
02:12:46,407 --> 02:12:48,267
I was very interested in the

1998
02:12:48,268 --> 02:12:50,528
section on
Arroway's video unit.

1999
02:12:51,248 --> 02:12:53,447
The one that
recorded the static.

2000
02:12:54,645 --> 02:12:55,966
Continue.

2001
02:12:56,926 --> 02:13:00,166
The fact that it recorded
static isn't what interests me.

2002
02:13:05,206 --> 02:13:06,526
Continue.

2003
02:13:07,405 --> 02:13:09,164
What interests me...

2004
02:13:09,445 --> 02:13:13,003
...is that it recorded
approximately 18 hours of it.

2005
02:13:18,003 --> 02:13:19,844
That is interesting, isn't it?

2006
02:13:26,243 --> 02:13:28,239
And you can see
over there, we're

2007
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:30,002
building 45 brand new dishes.

2008
02:13:30,282 --> 02:13:32,252
That means when you
put them together

2009
02:13:32,253 --> 02:13:33,962
with all the
radio telescopes...

2010
02:13:34,121 --> 02:13:35,562
...all over the world...

2011
02:13:35,722 --> 02:13:37,740
...we'll hear
farther into space

2012
02:13:37,741 --> 02:13:39,880
than anyone has
ever heard before.

2013
02:13:41,361 --> 02:13:44,200
Are there other people
out there in the universe?

2014
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:46,441
That's a good question.

2015
02:13:46,681 --> 02:13:47,800
What do you think?

2016
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,320
I don't know.

2017
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:51,240
That's a good answer.

2018
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:53,480
Skeptic, huh?

2019
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:56,790
The important thing
is that you all

2020
02:13:56,791 --> 02:13:58,999
keep searching for
your own answers.

2021
02:13:59,479 --> 02:14:01,480
One thing about the
universe, though.

2022
02:14:02,359 --> 02:14:03,559
The universe...

2023
02:14:03,998 --> 02:14:06,077
...is a pretty big place.

2024
02:14:07,038 --> 02:14:09,319
It's bigger than anything...

2025
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:12,318
...anyone has ever
dreamed of before.

2026
02:14:13,877 --> 02:14:15,437
So if it's just us...

2027
02:14:17,198 --> 02:14:19,317
...it seems like an
awful waste of space.

2028
02:14:21,156 --> 02:14:22,115
Right?
