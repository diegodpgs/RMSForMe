1
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,908
<i>What if I could put him in front of you?</i>

2
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,619
<i>The man that ruined your life?</i>

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,623
<i>If I could guarantee
that you'd get away with it</i>

4
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>would you kill him?</i>

5
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,331
The Blackmore Cross.

6
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,666
I understand it's your second.

7
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,792
Congratulations.

8
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,460
You have served honorably.

9
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,882
So that's it?

10
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,551
The order from the board
will come through shortly.

11
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,969
The final order?

12
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,304
Yes.

13
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,763
And the Bomber?

14
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,475
It's not your problem anymore.

15
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,728
I don't need to remind you

16
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,813
of the critical nature
of your final mission.

17
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,649
So please rest.

18
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,072
<i>Every suspect educates us.</i>

19
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,992
<i>Makes us better at what we do.</i>

20
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,163
<i>No more than this elusive sociopath.</i>

21
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:08,998
<i>He's efficient.</i>

22
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,334
<i>Precise with his timings.</i>

23
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,962
<i>The press have dubbed
him the Fizzle Bomber.</i>

24
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,632
<i>We stopped him this time.</i>

25
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,635
<i>But this was only a small attack.</i>

26
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,015
<i>This is his grand plan.</i>

27
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,769
<i>March 1975.</i>

28
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,437
<i>He keeps changing the day.</i>

29
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,692
<i>The explosion will level
10 blocks of New York</i>

30
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,029
<i>and leave over 11,000 dead.</i>

31
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,783
<i>Everything we've done
to stop him has failed.</i>

32
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,327
<i>But I was close this time.</i>

33
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,538
Just one more try.

34
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,707
<i>Grafts have taken.</i>

35
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,710
The reconstructive transplant is stable.

36
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,671
But you understand

37
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,049
you will look different
to what you remember.

38
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,510
Eyes will heal.

39
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,805
You should recover
well for this final mission.

40
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,432
And then I'll be decommissioned.

41
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,977
It's not just the physical injuries.

42
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,646
You've logged more field hours

43
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,107
than any of the other agents
I've been assigned to.

44
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,067
The risks are real.

45
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,571
The scars have begun to heal nicely.

46
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,245
Your vocal cord damage has reduced

47
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,124
but will not regrow exactly the same way.

48
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,544
There goes my singing career.

49
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,592
It will take some getting used to.

50
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,148
I've changed so much

51
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,402
that I doubt
my own mother would recognize me.

52
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,041
The order finally came through today.

53
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,168
I guess

54
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,128
it was inevitable.

55
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,299
<i>By the time you listen
to this seven years will have passed.</i>

56
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,093
<i>Our first mission</i>

57
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,679
<i>is just as important as our last.</i>

58
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,974
<i>Each one getting us
closer to our final destination.</i>

59
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,942
Sir, please raise your right hand.

60
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,696
Do you solemnly swear
to uphold the rules and regulations

61
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,824
- set forth by T.B.R. Code 7286?
- I do.

62
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,118
Do you accept that any diversion
from your mission parameters

63
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,954
will result in immediate court martial?
And if convicted

64
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,539
death by lethal injection.

65
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,665
I do.

66
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,501
Thank you, sir.

67
00:06:58,919 --> 00:06:59,919
Thank you.

68
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,012
<i>Time. It catches up with us all.</i>

69
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,390
<i>Even those in our line of work.</i>

70
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,020
<i>I guess you could say we're gifted.</i>

71
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,525
<i>God, Jesus, it sounds arrogant
saying that out loud.</i>

72
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,777
<i>All right.</i>

73
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,195
<i>I'll put it a better way.</i>

74
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,989
<i>I guess you could say</i>

75
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,659
<i>we were born into this job.</i>

76
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,715
Hey, look at this freak.

77
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,262
There you go, Derek.

78
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,724
What can I get you?

79
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Old Underwear.

80
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,686
Old Underwear. Straight up?

81
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,568
Leave the bottle.

82
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,031
From the look of you
I'm guessing you're not celebrating.

83
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,532
From the look of me?

84
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,201
What do I look like?

85
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,289
Just making conversation. Jesus.

86
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,959
<i>He's down!</i>

87
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,588
Hey, bud, two more.

88
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,340
Chaser, right?

89
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,723
You're new.

90
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,309
Yeah, I've been working
here a couple of weeks.

91
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,269
Yeah? How's it working out?

92
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,979
It's been quiet.

93
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,773
People staying home.

94
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,817
Because of the big, bad Fizzle Bomber?

95
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,902
Yeah, I guess.

96
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,029
Love it.

97
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,156
Like hiding makes you any safer.

98
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,075
Doesn't scare you?

99
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,329
Worrying about every freak show
on the subway won't change things.

100
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,915
That is true.

101
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:44,792
Haven't seen you around.

102
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,168
You come here often?

103
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,336
What are you, a faggot?

104
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,214
What's your problem?

105
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,548
Hey!

106
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,009
I was joking man. Jesus.

107
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,302
Yeah, well, that's not funny.

108
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,013
Tell me a good one then.

109
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,015
- What, a joke?
- Yeah, come on.

110
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,268
You know, a free shot. Come on.

111
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,352
No, no, I don't know any.

112
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,105
You work in a bar for Chrissakes.
Surely you know a joke.

113
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,607
No, I'm terrible with jokes.
Never remember them.

114
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,692
One joke?

115
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,321
All right, I know one.

116
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,406
But it's not funny.

117
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,991
I'm all ears.

118
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,077
All right, well, a guy
walks into a bar, right?

119
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,122
- Jesus, man.
- Just kidding. No, no, no.

120
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,540
I got a good one. I got a good one.

121
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,126
What comes first, the chicken or the egg?

122
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
The rooster.

123
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,839
Oh, shit, see? I'm terrible.

124
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,049
That's the best you got?

125
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,301
- Yeah, well...
- That's not funny.

126
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,510
I told you it wasn't.

127
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,308
You ever think about that, though?

128
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,809
About what?

129
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,519
You know, about what comes first.

130
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,188
What do I care?

131
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,732
- I got more important shit to worry about.
- All right.

132
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,275
Well, you're a big deal, you know.

133
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,943
You got important things to do, right?

134
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,403
What do you do?

135
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,113
Whatever I have to.

136
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,741
Yeah, well it's tough
making a living, that's for sure.

137
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,868
What do you know about tough?

138
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,247
As much as the next guy, I guess.

139
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,876
How about as much as an unmarried mother?

140
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,421
What does that mean?

141
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,760
Four cents a word, I write
confession stories.

142
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,888
"The Unmarried Mother" is my pen name.

143
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,307
Are you serious?

144
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,184
Yeah.

145
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,769
Right. Right!

146
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,270
How's business?

147
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,814
Business is okay. I have a weekly column.

148
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,649
I write them, they print them, I eat.

149
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,569
Right?

150
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,947
- What, you read my work?
- Yeah, yeah.

151
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,199
Does that surprise you?

152
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,242
- Yeah, a little.
- Why?

153
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,786
You don't fit the demo.

154
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
The demo?

155
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,040
- The demographic.
- Right. Right.

156
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,958
You know, broken women
who want to feel better

157
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,752
about their pitiful lives by reading

158
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,421
hard luck stories of
heartbreak and betrayal

159
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,964
spewed across the glossy pages

160
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,758
of 25 cent pulp sludge.

161
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,260
Yeah, exactly.

162
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,596
Yeah, well you're being a little hard
on yourself, don't you think?

163
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,014
It's garbage.

164
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,393
I thought I had some talent
telling stories but who am I kidding?

165
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,269
I mean, you tell me. You've read them.

166
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,022
I have to admit I've had a few

167
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,067
dark nights
when I've looked to you for a little

168
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,985
insight into the feminine mind.

169
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,863
You know, it seems to me
you've got a real hit on the woman's angle.

170
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,990
- Woman's angle?
- Yeah.

171
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,827
Yeah, I know the woman's angle.

172
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,745
I should.

173
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,873
Why, you married? You got sisters?

174
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,458
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

175
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,461
The one thing that this job has taught me

176
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,547
is that truth is stranger than fiction.

177
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,549
I have heard some incredible shit.

178
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,259
Nothing astonishes me anymore.

179
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,802
You don't know what incredible means.

180
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,178
Yeah? Well, try me.

181
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,059
Here you go. I got that.

182
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,527
Forget it, man. I'm not telling you.

183
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,029
You're scared it's not good enough.

184
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,406
- You think that'll work?
- Yeah.

185
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,490
What are we, 12?

186
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,701
Come on.

187
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,540
Bet you the rest of that bottle
I got the best story you ever heard.

188
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,335
Bet you a full bottle.

189
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:24,845
What do you say?

190
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,516
If I lose?

191
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,268
Just add a 20 to the tip.

192
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Why not?

193
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,317
Hey, man.

194
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,111
- Two Buds, bud.
- Right.

195
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,030
<i>Mayor Davidson,
how do you respond to the fact</i>

196
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,990
<i>that many New Yorkers are leaving the city</i>

197
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,784
<i>in fear of a fifth attack
by the Fizzle Bomber?</i>

198
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,411
<i>We've got extra police patrols</i>

199
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,455
<i>on 24 hour shifts around the city.</i>

200
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,375
<i>We've created a joint task force
with the Federal Bomb Squad</i>

201
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,921
<i>and the FBI in order
to track down the suspect.</i>

202
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,923
What a stupid name.

203
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,049
"Fizzle Bomber."

204
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,760
The guy makes compressed
RDX-based explosive compounds.

205
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,053
That's not easy.

206
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,013
"Fizzle Bomber" is easier to remember.

207
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,348
I hate that name.

208
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,391
Makes it sound like his bombs just fizzle.

209
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,643
Like they don't do any real damage.

210
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,645
I don't think anybody's doubting

211
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,897
how dangerous this asshole is.

212
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,942
Well, there's a lot of selfish assholes
out there needing a good shake up.

213
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,194
They should be afraid.

214
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,783
Well, he's killed 112 people already.

215
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,618
Some people just gotta go.

216
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,287
Stops the gene pool right in its tracks.

217
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,539
Yeah.

218
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,290
Maybe he's doing the city a favor.

219
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,588
Better be careful who hears you say that.

220
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,131
What, you think I'm wrong?

221
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,634
I'm just saying
that kind of talk can get you in trouble.

222
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,804
No worse than I've already been through.

223
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,057
Now listen, you keep promising
the best story of my life.

224
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,268
But I'm not hearing anything.

225
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
All right.

226
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,529
Guess I'll start at the beginning.

227
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,994
When I was a little girl...

228
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,912
What?

229
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,207
What, you want me to tell my story?

230
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,500
No, I just, I thought...

231
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,837
I'm sorry. Yeah, sure. Go on, go on.

232
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,719
When I was a little girl...

233
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,727
You ever hear of Christine Jorgensen?

234
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,228
Roberta Cowell?

235
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,107
Yeah, yeah, they had sex change.

236
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,444
So you... Don't interrupt.

237
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,452
It was September 13th, 1945.

238
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,623
<i>I was a foundling.</i>

239
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,500
<i>A newborn left on an orphanage doorstep.</i>

240
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,719
City of Cleveland Orphanage.

241
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,395
That's a good girl.

242
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,608
Well, there's no signs
of trauma or exposure.

243
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,193
The child appears healthy.

244
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,781
If she shows any signs
of infection or excessive coughing,

245
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,158
she should be taken
to the hospital for a thorough examination.

246
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,242
Yes, Doctor.

247
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,620
She got a name?

248
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,122
Jane.

249
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,166
Jane will have to do for now.

250
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,669
I'll be back to check on Jane in a week.

251
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,087
I look forward to it.

252
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,219
Don't worry, sweetheart.

253
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,304
We'll take good care of you now.

254
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,603
<i>I was just one
of a dozen babies who had no past.</i>

255
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,607
<i>But that was all we had in common.</i>

256
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,112
<i>I was never sick, not one day.</i>

257
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,822
<i>So I was never taken to a hospital.</i>

258
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,157
<i>Not until later in my life.</i>

259
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,675
Slow down.

260
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,827
One chocolate ice cream

261
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,787
- for the cute little lady.
- Thank you.

262
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,549
<i>When I was little, I
envied kids with parents.</i>

263
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,179
<i>I always wondered what it would be like.</i>

264
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,643
Stupid kid!

265
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,895
Get off the damn street!

266
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,151
Little shit!

267
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Jane!

268
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,446
Come here now.

269
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,159
Son of a bitch!

270
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,747
<i>I never understood
why my parents abandoned me.</i>

271
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,041
<i>What had I done that was so wrong?</i>

272
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,878
<i>But as I got older,
I knew something was different about me.</i>

273
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,774
<i>Sex confused me, you know?</i>

274
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,235
<i>The way it works, the way everything fits.</i>

275
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,363
<i>I felt different.</i>

276
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,990
<i>And even back then,
I knew that I was going to be different</i>

277
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,200
<i>from all the other girls.</i>

278
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,912
I made a solemn vow

279
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,873
that any kid of mine
would have both a mom and a pop.

280
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,834
A real family.

281
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,044
It kept me pure.

282
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,921
Away from temptation.

283
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,843
So I focused my attention
on more important things.

284
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,303
Like learning how to fight.

285
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Fight! Fight!

286
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,147
- Come on, Lucy, go!
- Come on!

287
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,274
What'd you call me?

288
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,901
Pinky, four-eyed, little bitch...

289
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:55,986
<i>I was tough.</i>

290
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,613
<i>Much stronger than any of the other kids.</i>

291
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
<i>Even the boys.</i>

292
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,660
All right, break it up!

293
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,288
- Jane, come with me!
- Let go!

294
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,123
- What's wrong with you?
- I didn't do anything!

295
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,129
<i>And I was smart too.</i>

296
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,964
<i>Top of the class.</i>

297
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,049
Equals...

298
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,678
Jane!

299
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,013
Jane.

300
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,181
How do you ever expect
to learn anything if you never...

301
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,266
Fifteen.

302
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,894
<i>Math and physics were my favorite subjects.</i>

303
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,770
- That's correct.
<i>- It all came easy for me.</i>

304
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,105
Retard.

305
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,358
Enough!

306
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,079
<i>When I got older,</i>

307
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,665
<i>I realized I stood
little chance of getting married</i>

308
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,001
<i>for the same reason I hadn't been adopted.</i>

309
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,421
<i>I was different.</i>

310
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,174
<i>A freak. A goddamn loser.</i>

311
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,344
<i>I stopped looking in the mirror.</i>

312
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,429
<i>I hated what I saw.</i>

313
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,477
<i>I have no photos of myself as a young girl.</i>

314
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,854
I don't even remember what I looked like.

315
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,482
It's just more of a feeling now.

316
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,442
Well, you look better than I do.

317
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,361
Who cares how a barkeep looks?

318
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,239
Or a writer for that matter.

319
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,867
But you know how it is.

320
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,370
People want to adopt
a little golden-haired moron.

321
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,121
And later on, the boys,

322
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,248
they want big tits and pouty lips.

323
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,376
<i>You know, perfect accessory.</i>

324
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,044
<i>I couldn't compete.</i>

325
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,170
Jane,

326
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,798
Mr. Robertson has made a special effort

327
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,217
to talk to some of our
graduating girls today.

328
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,136
You will do him the courtesy
of listening to what he has to say.

329
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,265
Jane, I work for a new organization

330
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,309
seeking young women, like yourself,

331
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,937
to train in a career in government service.

332
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,231
We are what you might call

333
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,274
progressive.

334
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,735
I hear you're interested in space travel.

335
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,406
Well, they say that girls
can't be astronauts.

336
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,077
That's true.

337
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,414
We're seeking young ladies
who show great promise

338
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,708
in the fields of mathematics and science,

339
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,502
as well as strong physical abilities.

340
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,261
I hear you're a bit of a backyard brawler.

341
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,479
<i>This was around the time the suits</i>

342
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:40,108
<i>finally admitted you can't send
men into space for months or years</i>

343
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,235
<i>and not do something to
relieve the tension.</i>

344
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,489
<i>They were looking for respectable types,</i>

345
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,824
<i>preferably virgins.</i>

346
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,951
<i>They liked to train them from scratch.</i>

347
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,580
<i>Above average mentally
and stable emotionally.</i>

348
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>But most of the volunteers were hookers</i>

349
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,086
<i>or neurotics
who would crack up 10 days off Earth.</i>

350
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,213
<i>They weren't special.</i>

351
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,385
<i>Just relax, Jane.</i>

352
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,221
Some of the ladies
before you got a little nervous

353
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,015
a little lost in thought.

354
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,102
Perhaps that's because
to them a thought is unfamiliar territory.

355
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,314
Do you see this as some kind of joke?

356
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,817
No, sir.

357
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,112
We've had some
of these Women's Lib types in here

358
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:27,489
causing a big fuss.

359
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,407
But that's not you, is it Jane?

360
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,076
No, sir.

361
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,827
Please take your glasses off.

362
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,005
I see you've had
some disciplinary problems in the past.

363
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,342
I've had nothing but straight As
in all my classes since the first grade.

364
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,510
Yes.

365
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,136
Have you ever been with a man?

366
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,305
Have you?

367
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,521
You understand what
this employment will require of you?

368
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,899
Will I get to travel into space?

369
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,984
If selected, yes.

370
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,445
No,

371
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,531
I haven't been with a man.

372
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,285
How do you see your role on this journey?

373
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:15,537
My role?

374
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,624
Well, many of the girls we've interviewed
see this as a paid vacation.

375
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,794
A chance to live the good life
and meet the man of their dreams.

376
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,963
Do you see yourself as a tourist

377
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,881
or a participant?

378
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,219
I've excelled
in advanced physics, biology and astronomy.

379
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,054
A tourist is someone who

380
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,516
travels across the ocean only to be
photographed sitting next to their boat.

381
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,686
I have no intention of being a tourist.

382
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,482
If they accepted me
they'd teach me how to walk and dance

383
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,567
and, you know,

384
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,569
how to listen to a man pleasingly.

385
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,197
Plus training for the prime duties.

386
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,408
Nothing's too good for our boys, right?

387
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,411
They made sure that you didn't get pregnant
during your enlistment.

388
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,621
You were almost certain
to marry at the end of your hitch.

389
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,499
Same way today's
Flight Angels marry Spacers.

390
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,376
Well, they talk the same language.

391
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,086
Right.

392
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,182
<i>They gave me contact lenses.</i>

393
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,312
<i>I'd never seen the world so clearly before.</i>

394
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,602
<i>They tested our endurance.</i>

395
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,688
<i>Made sure we were fit for space travel.</i>

396
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,075
<i>Many of the girls struggled.</i>

397
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,369
<i>Not me.</i>

398
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,338
How often do you think about sex?

399
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,258
A, not at all. B, rarely.

400
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,802
C, sometimes. D, often.

401
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,637
E, all the time?

402
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,684
C, sometimes.

403
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,442
D, often.

404
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,280
<i>The testing went on for months.</i>

405
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,864
<i>They tested us on everything.</i>

406
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,292
<i>Many girls failed.</i>

407
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,253
<i>Not me.</i>

408
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,550
Highest numbers we've ever seen.

409
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,302
<i>Do you ever feel depressed?</i>

410
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,429
- What do you mean?
- Sad.

411
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,722
Empty at times.

412
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,641
Sometimes...

413
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,395
I guess I feel
like there's something out of balance.

414
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,564
Like I'm living in somebody else's body.

415
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,024
I don't know how to describe it.

416
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,569
And none of the girls here like me.

417
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,823
You'll just need to give it some time.

418
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,950
They'll come round.

419
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:46,748
Get her back!

420
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,334
- Come on!
- Go, Marcy!

421
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,425
Come on!

422
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,302
Come on, Marcy!

423
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,137
- Throw her down!
- Hit her back!

424
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,474
- Hey!
- Hey get off her!

425
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,728
- Get off!
- Stop!

426
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,247
We have performed a more detailed
physical examination of the patient.

427
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,301
I see.

428
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:43,137
You do know that this will disqualify her.

429
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,476
You've not told the recruit?

430
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,895
- No.
- Don't.

431
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:52,563
I'll take care of it.

432
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:02,907
I don't get it.

433
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,743
I was just defending myself.
What was I supposed to do?

434
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,328
I know.

435
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,251
Believe me, it's not over yet.

436
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,795
I'll go to the Board of Appeals.

437
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,755
I'll do everything to get you reenlisted.

438
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I promise.

439
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,716
Trust me, Jane.

440
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:22,552
<i>And that was it.</i>

441
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,679
<i>Because of a stupid fight I was done.</i>

442
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,141
<i>I had to support myself.</i>

443
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,018
<i>I couldn't rely on Mr. Robertson's promise
to see me through.</i>

444
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,397
<i>- You're a witch?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.</i>

445
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,816
<i>To earn money I worked
as a mother's helper.</i>

446
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,404
<i>This family simply wanted a cheap servant.</i>

447
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,537
<i>That was when
I first discovered confession stories.</i>

448
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,540
<i>I didn't care if they were real or fake.</i>

449
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,208
<i>It was a great way to pass the time.</i>

450
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,754
<i>I did housework during the day</i>

451
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,466
<i>and went to school at night.</i>

452
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,260
<i>When eating in formal situations,</i>

453
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,345
rest your knife and your fork on the plate

454
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,889
between mouthfuls or to talk.

455
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,099
<i>Charm class was a way
of proving to the Appeals Board</i>

456
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,560
<i>that I was working on my decorum.</i>

457
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,024
If you're finished with your meal...

458
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,359
<i>It was the first time
I wasn't good at something.</i>

459
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,572
And when I wasn't expecting it,

460
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,741
I met him.

461
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,306
I'm so sorry.

462
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,767
There he was.

463
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:54,936
Are you lost?

464
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,563
He told me he was waiting for someone.

465
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,317
Well, you know what they say about
good things happening to those who wait.

466
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,404
"But only the things
left behind by those who hustle", he said.

467
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,615
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

468
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,618
<i>It was a quote by Abraham Lincoln</i>

469
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,663
<i>- and I was thinking the exact same thing.</i>
- I was thinking the exact same thing.

470
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,789
What are the odds?

471
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,626
He was handsome, rich.

472
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,380
He treated me with a kindness
that I'd never experienced before.

473
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,967
You know, he actually had wads
of $100 bills in his pocket.

474
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,927
More money than I'd seen in my whole life.

475
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,762
He told me he'd take care of me.

476
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,014
All show, right?

477
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,687
- Do you shoot pool?
- Yeah.

478
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,108
<i>With the Fizzle Bomber
attacks becoming larger and larger,</i>

479
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,653
<i>many New Yorkers fear
a bombing of mass scale is inevitable.</i>

480
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,824
<i>Over 10,000 have already evacuated
upstate into surrounding counties...</i>

481
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,409
He was different.

482
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,868
I liked him.

483
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:56,414
He was the first man
who was nice to me without playing games.

484
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,832
I was young and in love.

485
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,792
Famous last words.

486
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,919
Haven't you ever done
something stupid for love?

487
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,671
Once.

488
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,298
So you understand.

489
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,465
I do.

490
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,721
<i>I never thought it would happen.</i>

491
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,639
<i>Falling for someone.</i>

492
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,643
<i>All my little rules
about being pure went out the window.</i>

493
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,730
It was the happiest time
of my life but it didn't last long.

494
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,152
<i>One night, he sat me down.</i>

495
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,737
<i>Told me to wait for a moment.</i>

496
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,071
Where are you going?

497
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,116
<i>He told me he'd be right back.</i>

498
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,952
And then?

499
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:36,954
And then nothing.

500
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,748
I never saw him again.

501
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,916
<i>He never came back.</i>

502
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,960
<i>Well, maybe he had a good reason.</i>

503
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,295
Okay.

504
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,379
<i>I didn't deserve it.</i>

505
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,716
Somehow I'd managed to convince myself
that it had been all for the best.

506
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,718
I hadn't really loved him.
It was just a fling.

507
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,138
I was more eager than ever
to rejoin Space Corp.

508
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,183
I'd been let down in my life so many times

509
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,726
why should I have gotten
my hopes up, right?

510
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,729
<i>Then sometimes</i>

511
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,149
<i>people surprise you.</i>

512
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,736
I hadn't been entirely
truthful with you, Jane.

513
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:09,904
About what, sir?

514
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,115
In order to protect our nation's citizens,

515
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,409
it's important we keep

516
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,079
certain government operations confidential.

517
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,413
Wouldn't you agree?

518
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,956
Yes, sir.

519
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,251
I work for an organization
whose primary purpose

520
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,337
is not space travel.

521
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,466
It's reshaping wrongdoings.

522
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,010
We use Space Corp, among others,

523
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,596
as a means
of finding people who are special.

524
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,516
They are what
you might call a recruitment agency.

525
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,018
I don't understand.

526
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,187
A recruitment agency for what?

527
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,944
For people with exceptional abilities.

528
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,821
People like yourself.

529
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,364
People without families.

530
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,533
Without husbands and wives and children.

531
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,951
No past.

532
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,786
No ties to the future.

533
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,164
You see, the work we do is complicated

534
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,126
and it requires employees with

535
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,920
advanced motor skills, remarkable memories.

536
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,589
It's a job for the best and the brightest.

537
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,299
For the elite.

538
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,344
The elite?

539
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,972
I couldn't believe it.

540
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,057
Seemed like I had
a bright future ahead of me.

541
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,560
I didn't really understand
what the job meant.

542
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,979
They were very covert and secretive but

543
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,773
I knew it would change
my life for the better.

544
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,735
And they didn't insist on virgins.

545
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:32,903
They were different to Space Corp.

546
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,825
It wasn't until my skirts got tight
that I realized my future was over.

547
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,203
You were pregnant?

548
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,706
Yeah, wouldn't you know it?

549
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,168
My mystery man had left me
with more than just a broken heart.

550
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,422
So that bright future,
that girl who was elite?

551
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,506
She was gone.

552
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,884
And I never saw Mr. Robertson again.

553
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,764
<i>With nowhere to go I
landed in a charity ward</i>

554
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,683
<i>surrounded by other big bellies
and trotted bedpans</i>

555
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,018
<i>until my time came.</i>

556
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,021
<i>I never felt so alone.</i>

557
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,489
<i>One night I found myself on an
operating table with a nurse saying...</i>

558
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:17,865
Relax, Jane. Relax.

559
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,074
Now breathe deeply.

560
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
How do you feel?

561
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,968
Tired.

562
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,221
That's natural.

563
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,099
A cesarean can be difficult.

564
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,893
You pulled through fine.

565
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,604
A cesarean? Doctor, is my baby okay?

566
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,939
Your baby's fine.

567
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,233
Is it a boy or a girl?

568
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,026
It's a healthy little girl.

569
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,861
Seven pounds three ounces.

570
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:58,906
<i>You know it's something...</i>

571
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,282
...to have made a baby.

572
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,452
I remember thinking I would tack
on the admission form "Mrs."

573
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,788
Let her think her papa was dead.

574
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,249
No orphanage for my kid.

575
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,168
<i>But then the surgeon kept talking.</i>

576
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:14,755
What is it, Doctor?

577
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,175
Have you ever had
a thorough examination before?

578
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,011
Yes.

579
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,763
What'd the doctors tell you?

580
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,432
Nothing.

581
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,684
I thought everything was fine.

582
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,728
So no doctor's ever told you that

583
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,106
your internal set up

584
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,316
was different than most?

585
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:36,861
No.

586
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,070
What are you talking about?

587
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,783
Why?

588
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,372
Did you ever hear
about that Scottish physician?

589
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,666
She lived as a female till she was 35,

590
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:54,336
and then she had surgery
and became legally and medically a man?

591
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,631
She got married. Everything was okay.

592
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,887
What's that got to do with me?

593
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,270
When we performed your operation
we found something very unique.

594
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,813
One of a kind, actually.

595
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:16,650
After I successfully removed your baby
I called for the Chief of Surgery.

596
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,154
We held consultation
and we worked for hours

597
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,489
to reconstruct you the best we could.

598
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,034
Reconstruct?

599
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,412
You had two full sets of organs, Jane.

600
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,165
Female and male.

601
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,375
Both immature

602
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,127
but the female set

603
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,755
well enough developed
for you to have a baby.

604
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,008
But I'm afraid, my dear,

605
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,012
the excessive bleeding from the birth

606
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,765
forced us to perform a hysterectomy.

607
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,392
We had to remove your ovaries and uterus.

608
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,856
What are you saying?

609
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,859
But the reconstruction

610
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,571
allowed us to create a male urinary tract.

611
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,074
Further surgeries will be required.

612
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,453
To become a man?

613
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,375
Is this some kind of joke?

614
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,877
I'm afraid it's not.

615
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,213
You're young.

616
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,799
Your bones will readjust.

617
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,884
We'll watch your hormonal balance.

618
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,594
It's not a death sentence.

619
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,388
Your life can continue.

620
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,024
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

621
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,945
Have you thought of a name yet?

622
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,240
Well, I was thinking of Jane,

623
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,534
after her mother.

624
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,079
<i>I guess it was a way
of keeping the name in the family.</i>

625
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,416
<i>After all, I knew eventually
I would have to change mine.</i>

626
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,376
That's a good name.

627
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,421
<i>My feelings changed to cold determination.</i>

628
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,257
<i>I had to do right by my baby Jane.</i>

629
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,385
But two weeks later
that didn't mean anything.

630
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,512
Why?

631
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,223
She was snatched.

632
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,267
- Snatched?
- Yeah.

633
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,560
What do you mean "snatched"?

634
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,020
Kidnapped.

635
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,938
Stolen from the goddamn hospital nursery.

636
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,442
I mean how's that for taking
the last a man's got to live for?

637
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,613
<i>When the nurse
had her back turned, someone walked in</i>

638
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,073
<i>and walked out with her.</i>

639
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,492
<i>Were there any clues?</i>

640
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,578
<i>Any description?</i>

641
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,288
Just a man.

642
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,540
<i>With a face-shaped face.</i>

643
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,751
<i>Like yours or mine.</i>

644
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,133
No! No!

645
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,678
Could have been the baby's father.

646
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,182
The nurse swore it was an older man
but who else would swipe my baby?

647
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,017
What'd you do?

648
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,311
Filed a missing person's report.

649
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,148
Checked adoption agencies,
orphanages. You name it, I did it.

650
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,192
But nothing.

651
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,985
It's like she vanished.

652
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,154
And they never found the guy?

653
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,158
Never.

654
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:16,163
But then my other little problem
began to take center stage.

655
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,252
Jane, I want you to count
backwards from 10 for me.

656
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,799
Ten, nine, eight,

657
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,803
seven, six, five, four...

658
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,058
<i>I spent 11 months in that fucked-up place</i>

659
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:39,186
<i>and had three major operations.</i>

660
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,190
I started taking testosterone,

661
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,026
which deepened my voice a little bit

662
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,153
<i>but not enough.</i>

663
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,573
<i>So I started practicing talking like a man.</i>

664
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,699
Hi.

665
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,076
Hi.

666
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,202
Hi.

667
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,328
Hey.

668
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,704
Hi, nice to meet you.

669
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,248
Hi, nice to meet you.

670
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,125
Nice to meet you. It's a lovely day.

671
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,377
Hi, nice to meet you.

672
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,755
It's a lovely day.

673
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,884
I never could get it right, though.

674
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,596
<i>Hi.</i>

675
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,474
My name is Jane.

676
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,354
<i>My name is Jane.</i>

677
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,444
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

678
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,363
My name is Jane.

679
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,741
My name is...

680
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,889
<i>I was always afraid to look in the mirror
and see the person looking back at me.</i>

681
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,433
<i>I held off as long as I could.</i>

682
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:06,398
<i>Now, it didn't matter anymore.</i>

683
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,614
<i>The person I knew was truly gone.</i>

684
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:45,938
<i>Strange.</i>

685
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,691
Every time I looked at my new appearance

686
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,152
I was reminded
of that bastard that ruined my life.

687
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,241
That's some messed up irony I guess.

688
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,578
The funny thing was

689
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,705
the nurses,

690
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,833
they thought I was quite handsome.

691
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,337
Yeah, a fucking catch.

692
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,381
Right, right, right.

693
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,343
I guess I also knew
what women wanted to hear.

694
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,844
Compliments, right?

695
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,430
Right.

696
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,433
Well,

697
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,687
it seems to me you came out okay.

698
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,358
Came out okay?

699
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,859
Well, you know, I just mean

700
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,237
you just seem like a,

701
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,572
you know, a normal man.

702
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,325
Yeah.

703
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,161
More normal than ever now.

704
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,580
How so? What's that mean?

705
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,375
Well, I just found out this morning that

706
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,377
I'm not shooting blanks anymore.

707
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,547
Well, all right.

708
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,884
Doctor's prognosis,
I'm a fully fertile male specimen.

709
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,512
Well, let me be the first
to congratulate you.

710
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,556
Welcome to the tribe.

711
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,565
You know, sometimes

712
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,778
I think this world deserves
the shit storm that it gets.

713
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:19,406
I know.

714
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,367
I mean, let's face it. Nobody's innocent.

715
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,331
Everybody just uses everybody else
to get what they want.

716
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,916
Maybe.

717
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:31,793
Maybe not.

718
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,302
You ever hear the expression
"a ruined woman"?

719
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,470
Of course.

720
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:45,432
Well, I was as ruined as a woman could be.

721
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,810
I was no longer a woman

722
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,605
and I did not know how to be a man.

723
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,274
Well, it does take some getting used to.

724
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,610
You have no idea.

725
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,655
I don't mean learning how to dress or talk.

726
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,576
Or not walking into the wrong bathroom.

727
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,914
You know, how could I live?

728
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,333
What job could I get?

729
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,335
I didn't know a trade.

730
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,128
Couldn't drive a car.

731
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:19,841
I hate that bastard for
ripping out my heart

732
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,468
and ruining my life.

733
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,096
He deserves to die.

734
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,684
<i>So I thought I'd reenlist in Space Corp.</i>

735
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,646
<i>This time to become an astronaut.</i>

736
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,650
<i>It was ridiculous, I know.</i>

737
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,860
<i>They had my records. I couldn't lie.</i>

738
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,908
<i>One look at me
and I was marked unfit for basic training.</i>

739
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,745
<i>I think the doctor spent time
on me just from curiosity.</i>

740
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,873
<i>He'd read about my case.</i>

741
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,335
I was desperate.

742
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,003
I was looking for a way back in.

743
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,341
You know, I've been called
a freak my whole life.

744
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,802
Now I really was.

745
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,597
Just a lab rat to be experimented on.

746
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,682
I'm so sorry.

747
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,809
- Yeah, right.
- I am.

748
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,524
I've had a lot of people tell me
how sorry they are for what happened to me.

749
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,610
I don't want to hear it anymore.

750
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:21,736
Then what do you want?

751
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:25,782
What does anyone want?

752
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,367
Love.

753
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,870
Fuck love.

754
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,330
A purpose.

755
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:33,874
A purpose?

756
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,376
You don't have that?

757
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,587
I'm working on it.

758
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,839
Why can't love be a purpose?

759
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:42,883
Hippy bullshit.

760
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,177
It's easier to hate than to love, right?

761
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,221
Yeah.

762
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,931
It's easier to destroy something.

763
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,099
Kill somebody.

764
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,726
You think you could do that?

765
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,312
Maybe.

766
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,067
I see it in your eyes, too.

767
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,403
That bitterness.

768
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,864
It can take over.

769
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,200
It can.

770
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,998
Well, you know if you don't move forward

771
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,626
you fall backwards into a river of shit.

772
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,880
So

773
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,469
anyway, rather than getting angry
and pissing away my entire future

774
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,097
I knew I just had to get on with my life.

775
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,357
<i>So</i>

776
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,776
<i>I changed my name</i>

777
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,944
<i>and came to New York.</i>

778
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:55,539
<i>I got by as a fry cook</i>

779
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,208
<i>but the hours were long
and the money was horseshit.</i>

780
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:04,839
<i>So I bought a typewriter
and set myself up as a public stenographer.</i>

781
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,884
<i>What a laugh.</i>

782
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,806
<i>In four months I typed six letters
and one manuscript.</i>

783
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:17,060
<i>The manuscript was for</i> Real Life Tales
<i>and a total waste of paper.</i>

784
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,895
<i>But the jerk who wrote it, sold it.</i>

785
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,188
<i>Which gave me an idea.</i>

786
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,945
<i>I bought a stack of confession magazines
and studied them.</i>

787
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,080
<i>The words came easy.</i>

788
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,167
<i>The Unmarried Mother was born.</i>

789
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,256
<i>So, now you know how I get
the authentic woman's angle</i>

790
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,633
on an Unmarried Mother story.

791
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,344
Through the only version I haven't sold.

792
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,054
The true one.

793
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:57,183
So, do I win the bottle?

794
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,229
Not bad.

795
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,190
Not bad.

796
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,945
So, is that it? Story's over?

797
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:11,114
Yeah, afraid so.

798
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,160
The man that ruined my life is a ghost
and so is my daughter.

799
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,954
I guess at some point you just
gotta let things go.

800
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,039
And have you?

801
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:20,332
Fuck no.

802
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,254
What if I could put him in front of you?

803
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,215
The man that ruined your life.

804
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,302
And if I could guarantee you

805
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:33,887
that you'd get away with it.

806
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,223
Would you kill him?

807
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,852
In a heartbeat.

808
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,022
I know where he is.

809
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:46,941
Yeah, of course you do.

810
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,026
No bullshit.

811
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,028
And how the hell do you know that?

812
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:54,366
There are records.

813
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,869
Hospital records, orphanage records,
medical records...

814
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,995
Been there, done that.

815
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,289
Beth Fetherage.

816
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,417
Wasn't that the name of your caretaker
at the orphanage?

817
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:05,919
Beth?

818
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:08,755
You son of a bitch.

819
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,006
Have you been following me?

820
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,591
Son of a bitch. That's funny.

821
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,593
No.

822
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,262
Your name, as a woman, was Jane, right?

823
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,723
You told me that. You didn't tell me
your name as a man.

824
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,726
John. Which is not terribly original,
by the way.

825
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,019
What are you, a cop or something?

826
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,188
I can put this guy in your lap.

827
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,191
You can do whatever you want

828
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,945
and I guarantee you
you'll get away with it.

829
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,201
All right, where is he?

830
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,164
I do something for you

831
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,125
and you do something for me.

832
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,293
Fuck you.

833
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,295
Okay, well,

834
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,131
enjoy your prize.

835
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,134
What do I have to do?

836
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:55,343
You like your job?

837
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:56,678
Hell, no.

838
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,138
Nobody's ever given you a break, right?

839
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,223
Did you listen to my story?

840
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,892
Yeah, and you excelled during your
service training.

841
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:03,935
Excelled.

842
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,271
You have skills you've never had
the chance to use

843
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,731
and I can give you that chance.

844
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,441
Let me put it this way.

845
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,860
I hand him to you, you
do whatever you like.

846
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,446
And when you're done, you try my job.

847
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,697
You don't like it, you walk away.

848
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,243
You're not talking about
bartending are you?

849
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,163
I'm not talking about bartending.

850
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,914
What is it?

851
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,916
I'll show you.

852
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,001
No. Fuck that, no.

853
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,044
Stop playing games. Just tell me right now.

854
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,422
Look, Robertson explains it so much better
than I do.

855
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,842
Don't mess with me.

856
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,094
What, you're working with Robertson?

857
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,096
Yes, I am, and he wants me to help you.

858
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,224
You're part of Robertson's
little secret society?

859
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,309
Yes.

860
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,269
Tell me what it's all about then.

861
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,731
First things first.

862
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,525
Jerry! I'm going on a break.

863
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,325
Oh, fuck.

864
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,043
Where is he?

865
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:11,503
What, is he down there?

866
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,130
Listen, you're just going to
have to trust me, all right?

867
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,341
Now I must be drunk.

868
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,968
You better not be fucking with me.

869
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,180
You think I might be the Fizzle Bomber?

870
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,556
Maybe.

871
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,433
What if you're the Fizzle Bomber?

872
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:26,935
What if I am?

873
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,145
Well, come on.

874
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,438
This is what you wanted, right?

875
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,564
Come on.

876
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:39,572
<i>I'm my own grandpa</i> Here we go.

877
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,282
All right.

878
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,953
Follow me right in here.

879
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,832
Can't be too cautious these days.

880
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,340
What are you doing?

881
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:01,970
Killing somebody's not easy, you know.

882
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:08,101
No matter how much hate and anger
you may have in your heart,

883
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,228
when it comes time to pull the trigger

884
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,479
most people can't do it.

885
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,398
You speaking from experience?

886
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:15,441
I'm just telling you the truth.

887
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:19,946
Well, I'm not afraid.

888
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,115
You bring him to me and I won't hesitate.

889
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,117
All right, that's good.

890
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,036
So, where is he?

891
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:28,121
Hold your horses.

892
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,127
What, are you going to play for me?

893
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,129
No, no. I'm going to play you the past.

894
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:41,467
This is a USFF Coordinates
Transformer Field Kit.

895
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,052
No moving parts.

896
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,847
It weighs approximately six kilos,
fully charged.

897
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,641
I've adjusted it to support our body mass.

898
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:51,603
It will calculate a
discreet arrival location

899
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:54,939
and avoid any materialization collisions.

900
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:56,733
So, what is it?

901
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,653
It's a device that creates a temporal wake.

902
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,238
A what?

903
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:03,948
It's a time machine.

904
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,285
You gotta be shitting me.

905
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,330
No, I am not.

906
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,334
Look, don't be alarmed, all right?

907
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,501
You have to stand closer.

908
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,211
You have to be within three feet.

909
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,047
What have you got two guns for?

910
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,340
Don't worry.

911
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,175
I've done this a lot.

912
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,430
Seriously, pal, you need to stop
playing games with me.

913
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,974
Stand still, okay?

914
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,434
Take a deep breath and hold this.

915
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,395
Hold it.
It's okay. Here you go.

916
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,483
Now, you just have to close your eyes.

917
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,985
Why do I need to close my eyes...

918
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,036
- God, what was that?
- Yeah.

919
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,162
The time distortion field.

920
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,206
- You're going to be fine.
- What?

921
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,124
Just take some deep breaths, all right?

922
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,209
What is this?

923
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,585
Just take some deep breaths.

924
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,712
The first few jumps can really
knock you around.

925
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,840
- Jumps?
- Yeah.

926
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,552
We're in Cleveland, Ohio, April 3rd, 1963.

927
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:10,348
What?

928
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,516
That's impossible.

929
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:12,934
I know.

930
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,853
Look, in this job you can't afford
to make any mistakes.

931
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,689
Timing is essential.

932
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,483
I've got some money for you.

933
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,152
The Temporal Bureau doesn't care
how much money you spend.

934
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,278
It doesn't matter to them.

935
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:26,531
What they don't like is any
unnecessary anachronisms.

936
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:27,991
The Temporal Bureau?

937
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,450
Is that the company you work for?

938
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,619
That's right. The one
you almost worked for.

939
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,329
So, where's Robertson?

940
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,123
He's in 1985.

941
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,833
What?

942
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,376
At Bureau headquarters.

943
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,007
So what, you're a cop?

944
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,467
I'm a Temporal Agent, one of 11.

945
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,720
We prevent crime before it takes place.

946
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,389
Here. Here's some clothes.
Put them on.

947
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,268
Well, how did you know
the clothes would be there?

948
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,478
Doesn't matter. We just need
to start blending in.

949
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,439
What, have you been here before?

950
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,691
It's complicated, all right?

951
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:03,443
Yeah, no shit.

952
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,528
Look, our time disruption footprint

953
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,488
needs to be extremely small.

954
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,991
The Bureau allows for slight variations

955
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,076
but ultimately the parameters
are extremely strict.

956
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,495
Any deviation from our mission
results in termination.

957
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,205
Termination of your job?

958
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,582
Termination of your life.

959
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,710
That's why you want to keep your
conversations to people in this time period

960
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,420
to an absolute minimum.

961
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,130
This time period.

962
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:27,633
Okay. So how far can you travel, then?

963
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:32,138
Travel beyond 53 years of zero point,
either direction,

964
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,474
will result in the temporal wake
disintegrating.

965
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:35,683
Zero point?

966
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,603
The invention of time travel.

967
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:39,729
And when's that?

968
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,356
It will be in 1981.

969
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:45,485
Right.

970
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:47,487
I can't believe this.

971
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,030
And so,

972
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,116
I get to be one of these, you know,
a Temporal Agent?

973
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,118
If you prove yourself.

974
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:56,746
Right.

975
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,166
So what's this guy to you?

976
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,586
Well, I'm starting to suspect that he might
be the Fizzle Bomber. All right?

977
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,672
But all that's clear is he's the
main obstacle that's held you back.

978
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,509
So, I kill him

979
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,552
you take me to Robertson

980
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:12,762
and you show me everything.

981
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,138
Agreed.

982
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,682
Right. Okay, so where is he?

983
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,142
Okay. Hey, hey.

984
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,852
Are you all right?

985
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:21,604
Yeah.

986
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,233
All right, he's at Cleveland College,
five blocks from here.

987
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,860
You remember? He's on his way
to meet Jane. You.

988
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,695
The 1963 you.

989
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,988
Yeah, I remember.

990
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,073
Okay, great.

991
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,829
So, I can do this?
I can change my past?

992
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,205
Yes, you can.

993
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,250
Have you ever thought about
changing yours?

994
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,294
I never deviate from the mission.

995
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,340
- Never?
- Never.

996
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,511
Look, I'll pick you up
when you're done, all right?

997
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,138
No. Whoa, where are you going?

998
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:57,473
Don't worry. I'll be around, trust me.

999
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:58,558
Do I...

1000
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,602
Do I have a choice?

1001
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,896
Of course. You always have a choice.

1002
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,899
Yeah, but sometimes don't you think
that things are just inevitable?

1003
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,987
Yes, the thought has crossed my mind.

1004
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,825
This life.

1005
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,743
Is it lonely?

1006
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:22,957
No family.

1007
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:25,585
No.

1008
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,630
But, you do have a purpose.

1009
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:34,886
Right.

1010
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,187
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1011
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,023
Are you lost?

1012
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,609
No, I'm looking for someone.

1013
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,736
Thanks, I'll just wait.

1014
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,864
Well, you know what they say about
good things happening to those who wait.

1015
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:46,207
But only the things left behind
by those who hustle.

1016
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,466
I was thinking the exact same thing.

1017
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,260
What are the odds?

1018
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,180
What are the odds.

1019
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:05,643
Are you okay?

1020
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,855
You're not how I imagined you'd look.

1021
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:12,984
Do I know you?

1022
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,530
You're beautiful.

1023
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,244
Someone should have told you that.

1024
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,541
Well, you just did.

1025
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,890
<i>If you ever want to stop the Fizzle Bomber</i>

1026
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,393
<i>you'll never get another chance.</i>

1027
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:40,793
Come on, come on.

1028
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,384
<i>Sometimes don't you think that things
are just inevitable?</i>

1029
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,513
<i>Yes, the thought has crossed my mind.</i>

1030
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,778
Time travel can be disorienting.

1031
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,865
Even short jumps
can knock you around a bit.

1032
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,868
Don't ever exceed the jump limit.

1033
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,871
It can be problematic.

1034
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,416
Deep breaths.

1035
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,501
<i>They always help.</i>

1036
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,721
I don't get out and meet
a lot of new people.

1037
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:20,934
Why not?

1038
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:24,813
I don't know. I just don't.

1039
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,072
Are you nervous?

1040
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,116
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1041
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,203
<i>Don't forget to buy a
hat, gloves and a jacket.</i>

1042
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:41,747
It's cold this time of year, back in '64.

1043
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,043
This is a job, all right? Remember that.

1044
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,213
It's unlike any other, but you still have
tasks to perform

1045
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,422
deadlines to meet.

1046
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,716
Some days those tasks
are easier than others

1047
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:55,177
but it's imperative that you succeed.

1048
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,684
<i>You always knew this day would come.</i>

1049
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:07,856
You can do this.

1050
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,068
<i>Why don't you meet new people?</i>

1051
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,489
I'm not very good in social situations.

1052
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,157
Some people just don't like me, I guess.

1053
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:18,784
Why is that, do you think?

1054
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,452
I don't know.

1055
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,955
Perhaps it's because you think
you're better than them.

1056
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,290
Excuse me?

1057
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,210
Well, you think you're superior.

1058
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,796
Who the hell are you to...

1059
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,005
You don't even know me.

1060
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,090
Am I wrong?

1061
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,844
Takes one to know one.

1062
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,930
True.

1063
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,978
So, what makes you so superior?

1064
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,234
I can read minds.

1065
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,153
Oh, really?

1066
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:56,321
Yeah, absolutely.

1067
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,574
All right, what am I thinking right now?

1068
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,082
You're thinking,

1069
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:10,169
"Charm class isn't helping this situation."

1070
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,130
Wow. Amazing.

1071
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:15,674
You're thinking,

1072
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:20,679
"Why does everyone always get
what they want and I get nothing?

1073
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,723
"That I'm tired of being
tough all the time."

1074
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,018
Everyone thinks that.

1075
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:29,062
You pretend like love

1076
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,940
doesn't matter to you, when the truth is

1077
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,859
it's all you ever think about.

1078
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,068
That's not true.

1079
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,530
Okay.

1080
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,115
What, you don't believe me?

1081
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,742
You've known me for a whole hour.

1082
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,203
You've never been in love.

1083
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,079
That's none of your business.

1084
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,040
That's not an answer.

1085
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,625
What makes you think you deserve one?

1086
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:52,753
You're right.

1087
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,922
I'm sorry for being so direct.

1088
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,888
You said that I'm not how you imagined.

1089
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,223
Have we met before?

1090
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:05,891
No, I...

1091
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:08,602
I don't know why I said that.

1092
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,895
Because I feel like we have.

1093
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,899
Things haven't been easy
for you, have they?

1094
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:17,986
Everyone's got problems.

1095
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,279
<i>Yeah.</i>

1096
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,074
<i>We all trip up along the way.</i>

1097
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,618
But you and I,

1098
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,247
perhaps over the same things.

1099
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,209
<i>Mr. Robertson, it's good to see you again.</i>

1100
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:33,877
It's been a while.

1101
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,088
Yes.

1102
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,384
From your perspective, I suppose it has.

1103
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,761
I didn't think you jumped anymore.

1104
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,805
Only on special occasions.

1105
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,976
I have a piece of the
Fizzle Bomber's timer.

1106
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:59,319
You made an illegal jump.
That's a serious offense.

1107
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,238
It doesn't matter anymore.

1108
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,699
I had to try again.

1109
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,075
And did you apprehend him?

1110
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:06,577
No.

1111
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:11,331
The fragments of matter you leave behind
after each jump

1112
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,166
we can only repair so much.

1113
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,794
The onset of psychosis, dementia.

1114
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,004
It can be serious.

1115
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:18,839
I'm fine.

1116
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,841
How many illegal jumps have you made?

1117
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:22,092
Just one.

1118
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:23,927
I'll accept the punishment.

1119
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:33,437
The parameters set by the Bureau
are strict for a reason.

1120
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,814
They exist for our protection.

1121
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:38,901
However,

1122
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,988
I've always thought we could accomplish
so much more

1123
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,450
without the constant bureaucratic control
of the board.

1124
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:51,914
An Agent operating from the outside.

1125
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,753
<i>She'll endure so much pain
because of what I do.</i>

1126
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:00,005
That's the way it has to be.

1127
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,341
That's the way it's always been.

1128
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:05,844
You should understand that
better than anyone.

1129
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,974
The snake that eats its own tail,
forever and ever.

1130
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:14,937
You are here to create history
and influence what is to come.

1131
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,939
I don't think I can do it.

1132
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,776
Understand you are
more than an Agent.

1133
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,320
You're a gift given to
the world through a

1134
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,781
Predestination Paradox.

1135
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,282
You're the only one

1136
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:29,910
free from history, ancestry.

1137
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:34,957
The rooster.

1138
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,251
But you must complete your mission.

1139
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,003
You must lay the seeds for the future.

1140
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,005
We're counting on you.

1141
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:48,470
And what happens when that day comes,
when I have no knowledge of my future?

1142
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,017
Well, then, like everyone else

1143
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:56,144
you're just going to have to take it
one day at a time.

1144
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:42,357
You have a long journey ahead of you.

1145
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,995
<i>They say that the journey
of a thousand miles</i>

1146
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:00,125
starts right at your feet.

1147
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,004
And my feet sure could use a rest.

1148
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:19,227
All right, just going to cover up your eyes

1149
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,272
just to be safe, okay?

1150
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,152
<i>Jumping back almost 20 years can be rough.</i>

1151
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,570
<i>Hold the baby tight.</i>

1152
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,654
You ready?

1153
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,282
<i>And remember, deep breaths.</i>

1154
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:49,341
<i>Preparation is the key to successful,
inconspicuous time travel.</i>

1155
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:55,347
<i>Luck is the residue of design.</i>

1156
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,351
<i>Earlier, I had registered
as Gregory Johnson,</i>

1157
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:00,519
<i>Warren, Ohio.</i>

1158
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:02,479
<i>Keep it simple.</i>

1159
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,022
<i>Blend in.</i>

1160
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,537
Safe journey, Jane.

1161
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,206
Stay strong, John.

1162
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,375
You have a bright future ahead.

1163
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,065
City of Cleveland Orphanage.

1164
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,243
Stay here.

1165
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,120
Where are you going?

1166
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:43,955
Don't worry.

1167
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:45,832
I'll be right back.

1168
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,028
You sick fuck.

1169
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,071
You tricked me.

1170
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,656
The choice was yours.

1171
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,782
What choice?

1172
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:22,869
I'm not going to leave her.

1173
01:16:22,954 --> 01:16:24,329
That's the way that it is.

1174
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:26,081
It's the way it always has been.

1175
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,291
I'm sorry if you feel deceived.

1176
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:32,337
But it's a mistake to think that we can
change certain events.

1177
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:35,006
Just like you said, some things
are inevitable.

1178
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,176
- But I love her.
- I know.

1179
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:39,803
I know that.

1180
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,013
And now that you've found her

1181
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,641
you know who she is.

1182
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:47,185
And you understand who you are.

1183
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,648
And now maybe you're ready
to understand who I am.

1184
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,449
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

1185
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,702
The shock will wear off

1186
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:06,621
but you can take comfort in knowing
that these events

1187
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,873
are happening in the correct order.

1188
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:12,168
The path you're on will take you
to your destination.

1189
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:15,005
Where is that?

1190
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:17,590
You let me take you to Robertson
and he'll show you everything.

1191
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:23,722
I don't want to leave her.

1192
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:31,021
You're not.

1193
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,192
I never wanted to hurt her.

1194
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,569
I know.

1195
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:39,904
And now she knows too.

1196
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:47,662
John.

1197
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,248
Listen to me, all right? You're home.

1198
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,791
Your troubles are over.

1199
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:54,252
You're going to save millions of lives.

1200
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:58,465
You're about to embark on the most
important job a man has ever had.

1201
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,343
And you're going to do great. I know.

1202
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,847
All right, he's forward jumped 22 years.

1203
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,140
He's not used to this kind of distance.

1204
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,270
John had to want this.

1205
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,189
His life had to be fouled up.

1206
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:16,691
He had to have nothing in order
to achieve so much.

1207
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,862
A hundred horrible crimes
didn't go as planned, because of him.

1208
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,447
Because of the work you've done.

1209
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:25,367
But the Fizzle Bomber's still out there.

1210
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:27,952
I failed.

1211
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:29,913
He made you a better Agent.

1212
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,081
We've all learned things from him.

1213
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,374
He's made us better at our jobs.

1214
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,127
This organization wouldn't have grown

1215
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:37,879
if it wasn't for the Fizzle Bomber.

1216
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,049
You sound as if you admire him.

1217
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,384
He's a terrorist.

1218
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,968
Nothing's that simple.

1219
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,012
I wish that it were.

1220
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:51,684
What's this?

1221
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,771
It's the timer.

1222
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,689
Got some new leads.

1223
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:02,153
When you reach your final destination

1224
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,114
your Field Kit will decommission...

1225
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:07,951
As per regulation.

1226
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,454
You sure you want to retire to New York

1227
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,540
so close to the date of the blast?

1228
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,042
Yes, sir.

1229
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,089
You take care of yourself.

1230
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,175
Yes, sir.

1231
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:50,535
<i>I'm my own grandpa</i>

1232
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,038
<i>I'm my own grandpa</i>

1233
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,790
Jesus H. Christ, Conner!

1234
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:58,001
Here, look, I'll refund your goddamn money.

1235
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,879
I don't want a refund. Just let me play
the damn song!

1236
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,214
Yeah, come on, Jerry. Let him play
the damn song.

1237
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:04,549
And by the way, I quit.

1238
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:47,467
So, this is it.

1239
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:49,677
Home.

1240
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:33,513
<i>The order finally came through today.</i>

1241
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,349
<i>I guess it was inevitable.</i>

1242
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,603
<i>By the time you listen to this seven years
will have passed.</i>

1243
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:45,984
<i>Our first mission
is just as important as our last.</i>

1244
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:49,988
<i>Each one getting us closer
to our final destination.</i>

1245
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,448
<i>See, you'll find out that time</i>

1246
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,909
<i>has a very different meaning
to people like us.</i>

1247
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:59,914
<i>Time catches up with us all</i>

1248
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:02,292
<i>even those in our line of work.</i>

1249
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:05,003
<i>I guess you could say we're gifted.</i>

1250
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:09,173
<i>God, Jesus, that sounds arrogant
saying it out loud.</i>

1251
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:12,510
<i>All right, I'll put it a better way.</i>

1252
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,429
<i>I guess you could say</i>

1253
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:17,015
<i>we were born into this job.</i>

1254
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:25,356
You don't see a lot of guys
using these anymore.

1255
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,525
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

1256
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,193
It's just that...

1257
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,529
I get kind of sentimental about the past.

1258
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:33,573
That's cool.

1259
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:36,701
Me too.

1260
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,286
I see.

1261
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,166
<i>So, you're a writer?</i>

1262
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,543
<i>I used to be, I guess.</i>

1263
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,503
<i>And you're thinking of taking it up again?</i>

1264
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,089
I was thinking about it.

1265
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,300
- Right on.
- Yeah.

1266
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,426
What kind of things do you write?

1267
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:56,387
Oh, just confession stories.

1268
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:00,141
<i>What, kind of like those
scorned women stories?</i>

1269
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:04,020
You know, passion, heartbreak, jealousy.

1270
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,648
No, not kinda like, exactly like.

1271
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:09,233
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

1272
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,654
<i>You don't look like the type of guy
that'd be into that.</i>

1273
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,075
What do I look like I would be into?

1274
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,245
That's a big question.

1275
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:25,166
<i>Well, you're interested in this
gorgeous '40 Royal Portable.</i>

1276
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,250
<i>I am.</i>

1277
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:29,921
Tool of choice for Hemingway,
Kerouac, Fleming.

1278
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:33,091
And taking into account I've known you
for a whole 30 seconds...

1279
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:36,010
<i>I'm thinking you're into adventure.</i>

1280
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,512
<i>Suspense.</i>

1281
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,138
<i>Maybe a touch of romance.</i>

1282
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:43,059
And definitely a big splash of murder.

1283
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:46,145
- That's stupid, right?
- No, it's not.

1284
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,940
It's never too late to be who
you might have been.

1285
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:13,631
<i>It's not just the physical injuries.</i>

1286
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,092
<i>You've logged more field hours</i>

1287
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,678
than any of the other Agents
I've been assigned to.

1288
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,639
<i>The risks are real.</i>

1289
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,689
<i>The fragments of matter
you leave behind after each jump</i>

1290
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,649
<i>we can only repair so much.</i>

1291
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,693
The onset of psychosis, dementia.

1292
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,194
That can be serious.

1293
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,279
I'm fine.

1294
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,284
<i>Time travel can be disorienting.</i>

1295
01:24:42,453 --> 01:24:43,995
<i>Don't ever exceed the jump limit.</i>

1296
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,164
It can be problematic.

1297
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:52,211
<i>The snake that eats its own tail</i>

1298
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:54,338
<i>forever and ever.</i>

1299
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,258
<i>I know where I come from.</i>

1300
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,511
<i>But where do all you zombies come from?</i>

1301
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:27,789
Oh, my God.

1302
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,168
You look good.

1303
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:36,589
I missed you.

1304
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:39,801
You're the Fizzle Bomber?

1305
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:45,640
We always hated that name, remember?

1306
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,559
You're a murderer.

1307
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:53,147
No, no, no. See, I've saved lives,
more than I ever could have

1308
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:54,690
from inside the bureau.

1309
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,734
No, you kill innocent people.

1310
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:58,611
Innocent people.

1311
01:25:58,695 --> 01:25:59,695
No, no, no.

1312
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:02,657
I have clippings from the future.

1313
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:05,660
Clippings from futures that never happened

1314
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,662
because I prevented them.

1315
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:12,208
More tragedies prevented, lives saved.

1316
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:13,334
You see this?

1317
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,294
- Saved?
- Yeah, yeah. Look.

1318
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,464
Look. 1974, Chicago chemical spill.

1319
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,967
That driver never made it to work
in the morning.

1320
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:25,221
Now, 324 lives saved.

1321
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,473
Look, look. What's next? What's next?

1322
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:33,604
Right, well we have... We have 1991,
April 3rd, Hamburg, Germany.

1323
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:37,316
1,861 lives saved.

1324
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:41,737
The Hardshaw Weapons Factory Heist, 1968.

1325
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,824
You know, the terrorists never came in the
building because I blew it the fuck up.

1326
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:48,786
3,027 lives I saved.

1327
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,206
Do you keep count of all the civilians
you killed as well?

1328
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:56,294
Your next attack will kill 10,000 more.

1329
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,756
You're disappointed in me, right?

1330
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:03,217
I remember that, I do.

1331
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:04,969
But when the dust settles

1332
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,724
I think you'll see that
we did the right thing.

1333
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,268
I will never become you.

1334
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,770
No, I'm curious.

1335
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,814
Did you report

1336
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:20,318
that your decommissioned Field Kit
didn't decommission?

1337
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:22,820
Right?

1338
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:25,656
Some people say that it's fate.

1339
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:27,950
But you and I,

1340
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,493
we know

1341
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,454
some things are predestined.

1342
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,582
I made you who you are.
You made me who I am.

1343
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:35,917
It's a paradox, right?

1344
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,835
But it can't be paradoctored.

1345
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:40,504
Right?

1346
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:43,674
I had so much fun at preempting you, I did.

1347
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,344
And now you're free and you found me

1348
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,804
and we can be together.

1349
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:50,640
I'll never become you.

1350
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:51,724
Don't say that.

1351
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:52,892
Don't say that.

1352
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,602
We're just puppets.

1353
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,480
We are Robertson.

1354
01:27:57,564 --> 01:27:58,689
He set the whole thing up.

1355
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:01,025
He played us for fools.

1356
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,693
He's laying out the dominoes.

1357
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:04,445
You know, we're just watching it fall.

1358
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,822
I will never become you

1359
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:09,784
and I will not let you kill those people.

1360
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:10,868
Wait, wait, wait.

1361
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,371
What, you're gonna live a regular life

1362
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:16,374
with that bitch, Alice,
from the antique store?

1363
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,668
She has a stupid cat,

1364
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:21,963
she has a disgusting birthmark
on her left hip.

1365
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,714
She's a lousy fucking cook.

1366
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:24,799
Okay, trust me.

1367
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,634
She can't handle our secrets.

1368
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,970
She can't, trust me.
She's not right for us.

1369
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:33,474
You have no idea what is right for me.

1370
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,811
Okay, okay, okay, all
we have is each other.

1371
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,563
It is all we've ever had.

1372
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:41,774
Now if you shoot me

1373
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:43,693
you'll become me.

1374
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:45,736
You get it?

1375
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,405
That's how it happens.

1376
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,490
If you want to break the chain

1377
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,367
you have to not kill me

1378
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:56,580
but try to love me, again.

1379
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,418
What if I put him in front of you,

1380
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:03,254
the man who ruined your life...

1381
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:06,841
Forget all that.

1382
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:08,759
We can have a future together.

1383
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:10,428
Would you kill him

1384
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,388
to save thousands?

1385
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:14,056
You wanna know what
we're gonna do tomorrow?

1386
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:17,601
No.

1387
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:41,042
<i>Here you are</i>

1388
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,878
<i>at the beginning of your new life.</i>

1389
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:47,089
<i>It can be overwhelming</i>

1390
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:49,717
<i>knowing the future you're about to create.</i>

1391
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,054
<i>Knowing the purpose of that life.</i>

1392
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,682
You know who she is.

1393
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,394
And you understand who you are.

1394
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,856
And now maybe you're ready
to understand who I am.

1395
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:09,737
You see I love her, too.

1396
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:51,737
<i>You'll have to make tough choices.</i>

1397
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:54,907
<i>You'll influence the past.</i>

1398
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,536
<i>Can we change our futures?</i>

1399
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:00,663
<i>I don't know.</i>

1400
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,583
<i>The only thing that I know for sure</i>

1401
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,712
<i>is that you are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.</i>

1402
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:13,884
<i>I miss you dreadfully.</i>
