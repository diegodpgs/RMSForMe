1
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:29,922
In our relations with other people,

2
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:32,162
we mainly discuss and evaluate

3
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:36,322
their character and behavior.

4
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:39,962
That is why I have withdrawn

5
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:44,642
from nearly all so-called relations.

6
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:48,722
This has made my oldage
rather lonely.

7
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:55,042
My life has been full of hard work,
and I am grateful.

8
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:01,122
It began as toil
for bread and butter

9
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:03,962
and ended in a love for science.

10
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:09,282
I have a son, also a doctor,
who lives in Lund.

11
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:15,122
He has been married for many years.
They have no children.

12
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:20,842
My old mother is still alive
and is very active, in spite of her age.

13
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:31,962
My wife Karin
has been dead for many years.

14
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:38,362
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

15
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:43,682
Thank you.

16
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:45,922
I am lucky
in having a good housekeeper.

17
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:50,362
Perhaps I should add
that I am an old pedant,

18
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:55,882
which at times
has been rather trying

19
00:01:58,522 --> 00:01:59,122
for myself and those around me.

20
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:06,242
My name is Isak Borg,

21
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:10,402
and I am 78.

22
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:13,922
Tomorrow I shall receive
an honorary degree in Lund Cathedral.

23
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:34,762
WILD STRAWBERRIES

24
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:38,842
In the early hours of June 1st,

25
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:42,202
I had a weird
and very unpleasant dream.

26
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:47,162
I dreamt that during
my morning walk

27
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:50,762
I lost my way among empty streets

28
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:56,362
with ruined houses.

29
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:09,282
Are you ill?

30
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,482
Miss Agda, please prepare
some breakfast. I'm taking the car.

31
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:14,322
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

32
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:18,642
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

33
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:22,042
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

34
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:26,802
And who will pack your tails?

35
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:29,722
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

36
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:34,002
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

37
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:39,722
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

38
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:44,482
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

39
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:48,442
and now you're taking the car.

40
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:51,842
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

41
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:54,562
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

42
00:09:57,642 --> 00:09:58,242
You'll ruin everything!

43
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:01,922
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in Malmo?

44
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:05,522
You can think up an explanation.

45
00:10:11,802 --> 00:10:12,402
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

46
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:16,882
Now listen, Miss Agda!

47
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:19,082
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

48
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:24,242
We're not married, Miss Agda.

49
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:26,762
I thank God for that every night.

50
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:31,442
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

51
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,002
Is that your last word?

52
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:38,602
Yes.

53
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:42,682
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

54
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:48,322
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

55
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,002
Incredible that I have put up...

56
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,122
with your bossing for so long.

57
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:02,082
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

58
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:05,642
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

59
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:17,922
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

60
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:28,322
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

61
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:31,522
Really?

62
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:34,402
Old sourpuss.

63
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:36,002
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

64
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:38,002
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

65
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:47,562
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

66
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:56,962
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

67
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:00,362
I hate resentful people.

68
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:03,202
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

69
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:08,882
Toast?

70
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,562
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

71
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:12,882
What are you cross about?

72
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:21,562
Don't you want a cup?

73
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:29,602
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

74
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:31,042
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

75
00:12:35,242 --> 00:12:35,842
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

76
00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:39,562
There has been no row.

77
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:41,962
No, not at all.

78
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:45,562
You're taking the car to Lund?

79
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:47,682
Yes.

80
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:48,842
Can I come with you?

81
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:50,642
You're going home?

82
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:52,282
Yes, I want to go home.

83
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:55,242
Home to Evald?

84
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:57,082
You don't need to ask why.

85
00:12:58,202 --> 00:12:58,802
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

86
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:01,602
Of course you may ride with me.

87
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:03,922
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

88
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:09,082
Good heavens!

89
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,002
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

90
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:43,522
I forgot.

91
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:45,002
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

92
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:49,522
Beautiful weather.

93
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:50,882
Yes, but sultry.

94
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:55,482
- I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

95
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:58,002
No, give me a cigar anytime.

96
00:13:59,162 --> 00:13:59,762
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

97
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:03,162
And what vices may a woman have?

98
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:06,242
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

99
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:09,482
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

100
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:12,322
Why do you ask?

101
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:13,842
No reason. Why?

102
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:15,682
I know why you asked.

103
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:18,682
Oh, well.

104
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,042
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

105
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:27,162
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

106
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:29,682
Why are you going home?

107
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:31,802
On impulse. Nothing more.

108
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:33,802
Evald happens to be my son.

109
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:36,162
So he is.

110
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:37,682
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

111
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:41,282
You don't need to tell me that.

112
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:43,242
Now, this loan, for instance.

113
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:44,722
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

114
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:46,682
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

115
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:49,522
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

116
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:52,202
and so on, and so on.

117
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:53,602
A promise is a promise.

118
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:55,642
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

119
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:58,562
and that your son
works himself to death.

120
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:00,562
You have your own income.

121
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:03,042
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

122
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:05,042
and don't need the money.

123
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:06,522
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

124
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:13,122
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

125
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:25,922
What doy ou have against me?

126
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:29,482
Shall I be frank?

127
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:31,282
Yes, I'm asking you.

128
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:33,922
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

129
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:36,562
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

130
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:42,122
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

131
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:48,122
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

132
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:54,562
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

133
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:00,722
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

134
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:05,202
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

135
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:08,162
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

136
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:10,722
Remember what you answered?

137
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:13,282
I said I'd be delighted.

138
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:17,602
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

139
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,122
"Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

140
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:26,282
I don't give a damn.

141
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:28,122
You and Evald must make
the best of it."

142
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,202
Did I say that?

143
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:31,882
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

144
00:16:34,642 --> 00:16:35,242
These were your very words:

145
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:37,842
"I have no respect
for mental suffering,

146
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:40,322
so don't come lamenting to me.

147
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:43,042
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

148
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:47,842
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now."

149
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:51,562
Did I say that?

150
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:54,002
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

151
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:57,122
I should hate to depend on you.

152
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:04,842
I have liked having you
about the house.

153
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:08,962
Like a cat.

154
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:10,762
A cat or a human being.

155
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:13,202
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

156
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:18,562
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

157
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:21,362
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

158
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:28,282
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

159
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:32,402
I'm not very interested in dreams.

160
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:34,802
No. No, of course not.

161
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:51,842
Where are you going now?

162
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:53,962
I want to show you something.

163
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:29,482
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

164
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:35,122
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

165
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:40,202
Does anyone live here now?

166
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:41,802
No, not this summer.

167
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:47,642
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

168
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:50,442
Yes, by all means, do.

169
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:05,002
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

170
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:20,122
Perhaps I got a little sentimental.

171
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:25,162
Perhaps I got a little tired

172
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:28,002
and felt a bit sad.

173
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:32,282
It's not impossible that I began
to think of this and that,

174
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:37,642
associated with places
where I played as a child.

175
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:42,642
I don't know how it happened,

176
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:46,122
but the day's clear reality

177
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:48,762
dissolved into the even clearer
images of memory

178
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:54,002
that appeared before my eyes

179
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:56,642
with the strength
of a true stream of events.

180
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:16,962
Sara.

181
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:20,802
Sara,

182
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:23,202
it's your cousin Isak.

183
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:27,322
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

184
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:33,362
But you, you haven't changed at all.

185
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:45,002
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

186
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,042
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

187
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:51,242
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

188
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:53,962
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

189
00:20:57,242 --> 00:20:57,842
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

190
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:01,362
I forgot to make a present.

191
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:03,802
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

192
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:06,562
I'll help you.

193
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:07,842
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

194
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:11,442
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

195
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:13,282
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

196
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:16,402
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

197
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:19,602
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

198
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:22,522
And you have a darned cute nape.

199
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:27,442
You know you shouldn't do that.

200
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:29,042
- Says who?
- I say.

201
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:31,642
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

202
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:34,442
who thinks he's really something.

203
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:36,242
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

204
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:39,482
With you!

205
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:42,242
Come and be kissed on the lips.

206
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:45,042
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

207
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:49,242
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

208
00:21:52,842 --> 00:21:53,442
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

209
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:56,322
So secretly, everyone knows it.

210
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:00,122
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

211
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:03,242
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

212
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:08,282
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

213
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:13,362
but I think it's Isak.

214
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:15,802
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

215
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:17,482
And you're the horridest, nastiest,

216
00:22:19,682 --> 00:22:20,282
silliest, stupidest--
I can't find the words to describe you!

217
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:25,242
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

218
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:28,442
And you reek of cigars.

219
00:22:30,322 --> 00:22:30,922
It's a nice manly smell.

220
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:34,642
And the twins,
who know most things,

221
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:38,842
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

222
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:43,762
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

223
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:49,202
How pretty you are
when you blush.

224
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:52,682
You must kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.

225
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:56,042
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

226
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:00,522
- You're just saying that.
- No.

227
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:05,042
And the twins say

228
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:07,842
that you're mad about girls.

229
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:11,162
Is that true?

230
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:22,642
Oh, look what you've done!

231
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:26,362
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

232
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:31,802
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

233
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:37,962
You've made
a bad woman of me.

234
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:40,522
At any rate, nearly.

235
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:42,642
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

236
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:46,642
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

237
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:51,082
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

238
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:23,242
Where's Isak?

239
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,482
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

240
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:32,402
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

241
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:28,242
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

242
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:30,562
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

243
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:42,802
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

244
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:46,042
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

245
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:49,082
I have.

246
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:51,442
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

247
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:55,242
Your fingernails are filthy.

248
00:25:58,962 --> 00:25:59,562
Hagbart, pass the bread.

249
00:26:02,442 --> 00:26:03,042
Don't take so much butter.

250
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:06,242
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

251
00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:10,322
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

252
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:12,562
It's paint under my nails.

253
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:15,922
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

254
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:17,842
- I did.
- What?

255
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:21,842
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

256
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:25,602
I did!

257
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:28,522
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

258
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:32,282
How kind ofyou.

259
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:35,282
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

260
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:39,602
Never when Papa is not at home.

261
00:26:42,482 --> 00:26:43,082
Uncle has already had three drinks.

262
00:26:45,922 --> 00:26:46,522
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

263
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:50,562
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

264
00:26:52,322 --> 00:26:52,922
Twins, speakwhen spoken to.

265
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:57,322
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

266
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:02,202
You will do as Auntie says.

267
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,122
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

268
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:07,922
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

269
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,562
I want to give Uncle my picture.

270
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:13,562
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

271
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,442
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

272
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:18,322
No, after we've eaten.

273
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,322
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

274
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:26,162
You can't tell which is Fritjof!.

275
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,122
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

276
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:35,522
We saw you! We saw you!

277
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:38,482
The twins ought to be muzzled.

278
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:41,242
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

279
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:43,442
No freedom of speech, eh?

280
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:45,082
Shut up, you brats.

281
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:47,642
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

282
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:52,202
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

283
00:27:54,722 --> 00:27:55,322
Quiet, everybody!

284
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:00,642
But Sara!

285
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:02,282
They're lying! They're lying!

286
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:29,962
Isak is so fine and good,

287
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:37,162
so moral and sensitive.

288
00:28:40,842 --> 00:28:41,442
He wants us to read poetry

289
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:45,122
and talk about the next life

290
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:47,482
and play four-handed piano.

291
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:52,802
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

292
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:57,402
and he talks about sin.

293
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:00,162
He's on such a terribly high level,

294
00:29:03,562 --> 00:29:04,162
and I feel so worthless.

295
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:08,202
And I am worthless--
there's no denying it.

296
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:15,442
But sometimes it seems to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

297
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:19,202
if you know what I mean.

298
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:21,522
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

299
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:27,282
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

300
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:32,722
I don't want to be here all summer

301
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:35,002
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

302
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:37,642
I don't want to!

303
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:39,722
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

304
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:42,042
If he doesn't behave,

305
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:43,642
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

306
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:46,162
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

307
00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:47,922
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

308
00:29:50,362 --> 00:29:50,962
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

309
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:55,762
How unfair everything is.

310
00:29:59,362 --> 00:29:59,962
All will be well, you'll see.

311
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:02,242
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

312
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:06,602
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

313
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,042
How typical of the twins.

314
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:13,762
Flowers nod, grasses bow

315
00:30:18,162 --> 00:30:18,762
Around our lovely house

316
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:24,322
We our Uncle Aron celebrate

317
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:30,002
And with our song

318
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:32,082
Ornament his brow

319
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:37,162
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

320
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:40,922
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

321
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:52,322
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

322
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:54,802
You do that.

323
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:57,162
I was overwhelmed by feelings
of emptiness and sadness,

324
00:31:02,482 --> 00:31:03,082
but was soon awakened
from my reveries

325
00:31:07,322 --> 00:31:07,922
by the voice of a young girl
asking me repeatedly about something.

326
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:11,442
Is this your house?

327
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:13,362
No, it's not.

328
00:31:14,962 --> 00:31:15,562
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

329
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:17,962
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

330
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:20,922
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

331
00:31:24,322 --> 00:31:24,922
Oh, yeah?

332
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:27,642
- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

333
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:31,002
Looks antique.

334
00:31:31,602 --> 00:31:32,202
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

335
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:35,842
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

336
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:40,282
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

337
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:42,402
Well, I'm going to Lund.

338
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:44,322
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

339
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:47,082
I'm honored.

340
00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:49,922
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

341
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:52,362
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

342
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:55,802
Weren't they married?

343
00:31:56,562 --> 00:31:57,162
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

344
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:02,122
Let's leave, then.

345
00:32:02,762 --> 00:32:03,362
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

346
00:32:06,682 --> 00:32:07,282
- Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

347
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:10,242
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

348
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:12,322
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

349
00:32:15,762 --> 00:32:16,362
Ironic again, but it suits you.

350
00:32:19,762 --> 00:32:20,362
Let's be off.

351
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:26,722
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

352
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:29,962
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

353
00:32:37,762 --> 00:32:38,362
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

354
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:45,402
What a big bus.

355
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:47,122
Yes, there's room for us all.

356
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:49,162
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

357
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:08,722
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

358
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:12,762
We're crazy about each other.

359
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:15,522
Viktor's the chaper one.
Daddy insisted.

360
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:19,202
Viktor is in love with me too.

361
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:24,282
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

362
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:27,282
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

363
00:33:31,362 --> 00:33:31,962
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

364
00:33:35,762 --> 00:33:36,362
And I smoke a pipe.

365
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:38,482
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

366
00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:45,482
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

367
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:48,562
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

368
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:51,042
She was, actually.

369
00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:54,042
What happened to her?

370
00:33:55,122 --> 00:33:55,722
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

371
00:33:59,562 --> 00:34:00,162
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

372
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:04,242
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

373
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:08,282
Oh, dear,
now I have put my foot in it.

374
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:56,642
Are you all right?

375
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:58,242
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

376
00:35:00,762 --> 00:35:01,362
My wife was driving.
Are you all right?

377
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,122
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

378
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:14,242
That's mywife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

379
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:17,282
That's the complication
we were discussing when--

380
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:20,242
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

381
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:22,522
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

382
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:26,322
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

383
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:30,722
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

384
00:35:35,442 --> 00:35:36,042
Let's get your car upright.

385
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:39,122
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

386
00:35:41,402 --> 00:35:42,002
Some people are unselfish,
though you don't think so.

387
00:35:48,442 --> 00:35:49,042
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

388
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:55,122
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

389
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:00,042
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

390
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:11,562
Darling, you might have a stroke.

391
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:17,602
My wife likes ridiculing me.

392
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:20,082
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

393
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:26,642
I never know whether mywife
is really crying or just play acting.

394
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:32,322
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

395
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:37,122
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

396
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:40,042
Can't you shut up?

397
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:42,162
My wife can really live a part.

398
00:37:45,122 --> 00:37:45,722
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

399
00:37:48,722 --> 00:37:49,322
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

400
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:53,002
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

401
00:37:55,362 --> 00:37:55,962
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

402
00:38:01,242 --> 00:38:01,842
It's natural that you're upset,

403
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:04,122
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

404
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:06,682
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

405
00:38:08,522 --> 00:38:09,122
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

406
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:13,682
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

407
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:18,522
So you can afford to defend her.

408
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:20,322
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

409
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:23,842
Very sarcastic!

410
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:26,122
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

411
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:29,282
But little Berit is.

412
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:33,042
Do you know
what that means for me?

413
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:35,362
I gather you're a Catholic.

414
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:37,242
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

415
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:39,802
We ridicule each other.

416
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:42,202
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

417
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:44,602
So, you see,
we need each other.

418
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:47,922
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

419
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:01,322
There it came.

420
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:03,442
That's what is called syncopes,
isn't it?

421
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:09,082
Very funny.

422
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:14,842
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

423
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:19,002
Shut up! Shut up!

424
00:39:27,162 --> 00:39:27,762
This may be too blunt,

425
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:32,042
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

426
00:39:44,722 --> 00:39:45,322
Forgive us, if you can.

427
00:40:18,202 --> 00:40:18,802
It was with mixed feelings
I saw this region again.

428
00:40:22,402 --> 00:40:23,002
I had my first practice here,

429
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:26,322
and my old mother lives nearby.

430
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:40,842
Hello there, Doctor.

431
00:40:43,722 --> 00:40:44,322
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

432
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:46,802
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

433
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:52,682
Eva! Come here a moment!

434
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:57,282
It's Dr. Borg in person.

435
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:01,602
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

436
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:05,802
The world's best doctor.

437
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:09,602
Let's call the baby after him.

438
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:13,402
Isak Akerman-- not a bad name
for a prime minister.

439
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:16,882
Suppose it's a girl.

440
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:18,922
We only have boys.

441
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:28,282
And how's your father these days?

442
00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:31,362
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

443
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:35,482
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

444
00:41:38,802 --> 00:41:39,402
And you're going to see
your mother, Doctor?

445
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:42,882
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

446
00:41:46,282 --> 00:41:46,882
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

447
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:51,562
What do I oweyou?

448
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:53,282
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

449
00:41:55,962 --> 00:41:56,562
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

450
00:41:59,922 --> 00:42:00,522
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

451
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:05,202
There are things
that can't be paid back--

452
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:09,082
not even with gas.

453
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:10,842
We haven't forgotten.

454
00:42:12,842 --> 00:42:13,442
Ask anyone around here.

455
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:17,242
They all remember your kindness.

456
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:22,322
Maybe I should have stayed here.

457
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:25,642
What doyou mean?

458
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:30,482
You said you should have stayed.

459
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:33,362
Did l?

460
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:35,642
Well, thanks anyway.

461
00:42:39,762 --> 00:42:40,362
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

462
00:42:44,522 --> 00:42:45,122
You know where to find me.

463
00:43:07,642 --> 00:43:08,242
During lunch I was in good spirits

464
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:13,242
and told the young people about
my years as district medical officer.

465
00:43:17,202 --> 00:43:17,802
My stories were quite a success,

466
00:43:19,922 --> 00:43:20,522
and I don't think they laughed
merely out of courtesy.

467
00:43:23,762 --> 00:43:24,362
I had wine with the lunch,
and then port with the coffee.

468
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:33,002
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

469
00:43:38,922 --> 00:43:39,522
how radiant must be its source!

470
00:43:42,282 --> 00:43:42,882
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

471
00:43:44,562 --> 00:43:45,162
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

472
00:43:46,842 --> 00:43:47,442
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

473
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:51,882
It was beautiful!

474
00:43:52,642 --> 00:43:53,242
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

475
00:43:57,122 --> 00:43:57,722
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

476
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:02,242
I say that modern man--

477
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:04,082
I say that--

478
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:05,962
believes only in himself

479
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:11,202
and his biological death.

480
00:44:12,362 --> 00:44:12,962
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

481
00:44:15,242 --> 00:44:15,842
Man regards death with horror.

482
00:44:18,962 --> 00:44:19,562
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

483
00:44:23,282 --> 00:44:23,882
How sweet they both are!

484
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:25,562
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

485
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:27,722
Once you believed in Santa Claus--
now in God.

486
00:44:30,122 --> 00:44:30,722
You never had any imagination!

487
00:44:33,682 --> 00:44:34,282
What do you say, Professor?

488
00:44:36,282 --> 00:44:36,882
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

489
00:44:42,162 --> 00:44:42,762
so I'll say nothing.

490
00:44:43,802 --> 00:44:44,402
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

491
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:46,402
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

492
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:52,202
"Where is the friend I seek

493
00:44:55,202 --> 00:44:55,802
at break of day?

494
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:01,602
When night falls, when--"

495
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:05,682
"When night falls,
I still have not found Him."

496
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:09,082
"My burning heart
shows me His traces--"

497
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:12,922
Are you religious, Professor?

498
00:45:16,522 --> 00:45:17,122
"I see His traces

499
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:21,282
wherever flowers bloom.

500
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,202
His love is mingled with every air."

501
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:37,402
"His voice calls
in the summer wind."

502
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:40,482
Not bad for a love poem.

503
00:45:43,882 --> 00:45:44,482
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

504
00:45:49,362 --> 00:45:49,962
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

505
00:45:54,642 --> 00:45:55,242
- May I come?
- Of course.

506
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:09,642
Here comes the thunder.

507
00:46:17,962 --> 00:46:18,562
I have just sent you a telegram

508
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:23,082
on your great day.

509
00:46:25,842 --> 00:46:26,442
And now you're here.

510
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:28,042
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

511
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:34,042
Is that your wife over there?

512
00:46:36,322 --> 00:46:36,922
I don't want to talk to her.

513
00:46:40,082 --> 00:46:40,682
She has done us too much harm.

514
00:46:42,602 --> 00:46:43,202
No, Mother dear.

515
00:46:45,442 --> 00:46:46,042
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

516
00:46:50,082 --> 00:46:50,682
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

517
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:56,042
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

518
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:58,282
And why are you
gadding about like this?

519
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:01,722
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

520
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:03,842
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

521
00:47:07,442 --> 00:47:08,042
Evald and I have no children.

522
00:47:10,442 --> 00:47:11,042
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

523
00:47:17,242 --> 00:47:17,842
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

524
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:25,642
My mother lived in this house.

525
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:28,642
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

526
00:47:31,802 --> 00:47:32,402
Very well.

527
00:47:33,762 --> 00:47:34,362
Here are some of your toys.

528
00:47:37,882 --> 00:47:38,482
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

529
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:43,522
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

530
00:47:46,722 --> 00:47:47,322
Twenty grandchildren.

531
00:47:49,002 --> 00:47:49,602
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

532
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:52,602
Don't get me wrong--
I'm not complaining.

533
00:47:55,642 --> 00:47:56,242
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

534
00:47:58,962 --> 00:47:59,562
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

535
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:05,402
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

536
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:11,322
unless they want to borrow money.

537
00:48:14,362 --> 00:48:14,962
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

538
00:48:17,642 --> 00:48:18,242
Don't think that, Mother.

539
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:20,882
And I've one more fault.

540
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:23,562
I don't die.

541
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:25,642
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

542
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:29,322
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

543
00:48:32,962 --> 00:48:33,562
This was Sigbritt's doll.

544
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:37,242
She got it when she turned eight.

545
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:40,482
I made the dress myself.

546
00:48:42,642 --> 00:48:43,242
But she never cared for it

547
00:48:45,082 --> 00:48:45,682
so it went to Charlotta.

548
00:48:47,122 --> 00:48:47,722
She took care of it--
I remember it clearly.

549
00:48:52,482 --> 00:48:53,082
Do you see who that is?

550
00:48:54,362 --> 00:48:54,962
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

551
00:48:58,362 --> 00:48:58,962
And myself.

552
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:02,482
What a fright
one looked in those days.

553
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:05,962
May I have it?

554
00:49:06,922 --> 00:49:07,522
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

555
00:49:10,442 --> 00:49:11,042
And here's a coloring book.

556
00:49:12,402 --> 00:49:13,002
I don't know whose it was.

557
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:18,722
They've all put their names in it.

558
00:49:21,762 --> 00:49:22,362
Kristina has scrawled:

559
00:49:23,842 --> 00:49:24,442
"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."

560
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:30,642
And Birgitta has put:
"I'm going to marry Papa."

561
00:49:36,082 --> 00:49:36,682
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

562
00:49:41,522 --> 00:49:42,122
Don't you think it's cold in here?

563
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:46,362
No, not particularly.

564
00:49:48,482 --> 00:49:49,082
I have felt cold all my life.

565
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:52,882
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

566
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:56,442
You have low blood pressure.

567
00:49:58,802 --> 00:49:59,402
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

568
00:50:03,762 --> 00:50:04,362
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

569
00:50:11,122 --> 00:50:11,722
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

570
00:50:14,162 --> 00:50:14,762
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

571
00:50:17,402 --> 00:50:18,002
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

572
00:50:31,242 --> 00:50:31,842
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

573
00:50:35,642 --> 00:50:36,242
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

574
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:41,762
Now he's turning 50.

575
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:45,922
And little cousin Sara used to
carry him around and sing to him.

576
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:51,522
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

577
00:50:54,682 --> 00:50:55,282
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

578
00:51:00,242 --> 00:51:00,842
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to seeyou again.

579
00:51:05,402 --> 00:51:06,002
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

580
00:51:35,602 --> 00:51:36,202
Where are Anders and Viktor?

581
00:51:38,082 --> 00:51:38,682
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

582
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:44,802
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

583
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:48,002
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

584
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,042
I said they could talk
about me instead.

585
00:51:55,202 --> 00:51:55,802
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

586
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:00,602
so I left.

587
00:52:01,562 --> 00:52:02,162
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

588
00:52:05,802 --> 00:52:06,402
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

589
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:09,442
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

590
00:52:15,162 --> 00:52:15,762
I'll see to them.

591
00:52:16,922 --> 00:52:17,522
Which one do you like best?

592
00:52:19,722 --> 00:52:20,322
Which one do you like best?

593
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:22,642
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister--

594
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:26,122
He's a darling.

595
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:29,082
But a minister's wife--

596
00:52:30,602 --> 00:52:31,202
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

597
00:52:33,682 --> 00:52:34,282
- Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

598
00:52:37,242 --> 00:52:37,842
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

599
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:43,162
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

600
00:52:47,482 --> 00:52:48,082
But how can anyone believe in God?

601
00:53:03,082 --> 00:53:03,682
Well? Does God exist?

602
00:53:29,362 --> 00:53:29,962
I dozed off,
but was haunted by vivid

603
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:35,522
and humiliating dreams.

604
00:53:41,482 --> 00:53:42,082
There was something overpowering
in these dream images

605
00:53:47,882 --> 00:53:48,482
that bored relentlessly into my mind.

606
00:54:04,522 --> 00:54:05,122
Haveyou looked in the mirror, Isak?

607
00:54:09,722 --> 00:54:10,322
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

608
00:54:13,722 --> 00:54:14,322
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

609
00:54:17,082 --> 00:54:17,682
but I have all my life before me.

610
00:54:21,402 --> 00:54:22,002
That hurt your feelings, after all.

611
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:25,322
No, it didn't hurt.

612
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:28,682
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

613
00:54:34,242 --> 00:54:34,842
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

614
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:39,002
And so became unintentionally cruel.

615
00:54:43,682 --> 00:54:44,282
I understand.

616
00:54:44,922 --> 00:54:45,522
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

617
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:51,682
Look in the mirror again.

618
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:53,522
No, don't turn away.

619
00:54:55,562 --> 00:54:56,162
I see.

620
00:54:57,722 --> 00:54:58,322
Listen to me.

621
00:55:00,602 --> 00:55:01,202
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

622
00:55:04,642 --> 00:55:05,242
Love is almost a game for us.

623
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:11,082
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

624
00:55:16,602 --> 00:55:17,202
There! Now you're smiling.

625
00:55:21,282 --> 00:55:21,882
But it hurts so.

626
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:24,402
As professor emerit us,
you ought to know why it hurts.

627
00:55:28,882 --> 00:55:29,482
But you don't know.

628
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:32,162
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

629
00:55:37,442 --> 00:55:38,042
I must go.

630
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:39,802
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

631
00:56:11,482 --> 00:56:12,082
Poor little thing.

632
00:56:14,402 --> 00:56:15,002
Hush, baby. Sleep.

633
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:19,042
Don't be afraid of the wind

634
00:56:21,322 --> 00:56:21,922
or the birds

635
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:27,602
or the waves of the sea.

636
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:31,282
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

637
00:56:34,082 --> 00:56:34,682
Don't be afraid, little one.

638
00:56:38,002 --> 00:56:38,602
It will soon be day again.

639
00:56:41,202 --> 00:56:41,802
No one will hurt you.

640
00:56:43,282 --> 00:56:43,882
I am with you.
I am holding you.

641
00:59:54,522 --> 00:59:55,122
Please come in, Professor Borg.

642
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:15,522
Have you brought
your examination book?

643
01:01:24,482 --> 01:01:25,082
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

644
01:01:39,522 --> 01:01:40,122
There must be something wrong.

645
01:01:45,842 --> 01:01:46,442
Not with the microscope.

646
01:01:47,442 --> 01:01:48,042
I can't see a thing.

647
01:01:51,802 --> 01:01:52,402
Please read this text.

648
01:02:09,442 --> 01:02:10,042
What does it mean?

649
01:02:12,602 --> 01:02:13,202
I don't know.

650
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:16,642
Really?

651
01:02:17,202 --> 01:02:17,802
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

652
01:02:22,082 --> 01:02:22,682
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

653
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:29,562
Don't you know what that is?

654
01:02:34,682 --> 01:02:35,282
Let me think.

655
01:02:36,562 --> 01:02:37,162
Take your time.

656
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:40,802
A doctor's first duty--

657
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,402
A doctor's--

658
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:48,842
I've forgotten.

659
01:02:49,722 --> 01:02:50,322
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

660
01:02:54,682 --> 01:02:55,282
Of course! Now I remember!

661
01:03:10,802 --> 01:03:11,402
You have been accused of guilt.

662
01:03:16,642 --> 01:03:17,242
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

663
01:03:23,082 --> 01:03:23,682
Is it serious?

664
01:03:25,762 --> 01:03:26,362
Unfortunately, Professor.

665
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:40,042
I have a weak heart.

666
01:03:41,242 --> 01:03:41,842
I'm an old man.

667
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:44,202
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

668
01:03:46,882 --> 01:03:47,482
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

669
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:50,802
Do you want to stop the examination?

670
01:03:51,722 --> 01:03:52,322
No, for God's sake, no!

671
01:04:01,242 --> 01:04:01,842
Please diagnose the patient.

672
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:18,922
The patient is dead.

673
01:04:43,202 --> 01:04:43,802
What are you writing in my book?

674
01:04:45,522 --> 01:04:46,122
- My verdict.
- And that is?

675
01:04:49,002 --> 01:04:49,602
That you are incompetent.

676
01:04:54,362 --> 01:04:54,962
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

677
01:05:00,362 --> 01:05:00,962
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

678
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:06,202
Your wife has made the charge.

679
01:05:08,682 --> 01:05:09,282
You'll be confronted with her.

680
01:05:11,122 --> 01:05:11,722
But myw ife has been dead for years!

681
01:05:13,722 --> 01:05:14,322
Do you think I'm joking?

682
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:18,762
Please come with me.

683
01:05:20,842 --> 01:05:21,442
You have no choice.

684
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:44,122
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

685
01:07:47,202 --> 01:07:47,802
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

686
01:07:51,242 --> 01:07:51,842
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

687
01:07:57,242 --> 01:07:57,842
Tuesday, May 1 st, 1917.

688
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:01,802
You stood on this very spot.

689
01:08:03,002 --> 01:08:03,602
and heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

690
01:08:22,442 --> 01:08:23,042
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

691
01:08:26,962 --> 01:08:27,562
"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."

692
01:08:32,202 --> 01:08:32,802
Just as if he were God.

693
01:08:36,202 --> 01:08:36,802
Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"

694
01:08:42,682 --> 01:08:43,282
He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."

695
01:08:47,722 --> 01:08:48,322
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

696
01:08:51,842 --> 01:08:52,442
He'll say,

697
01:08:53,122 --> 01:08:53,722
"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."

698
01:09:01,242 --> 01:09:01,842
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

699
01:09:05,922 --> 01:09:06,522
because he's cold as ice.

700
01:09:10,122 --> 01:09:10,722
And suddenly he gets very tender,

701
01:09:14,322 --> 01:09:14,922
and I scream at him that he's mad

702
01:09:18,602 --> 01:09:19,202
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

703
01:09:22,922 --> 01:09:23,522
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

704
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:26,642
and that he understands
everything quite well.

705
01:09:30,442 --> 01:09:31,042
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

706
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:35,642
And he looks sad
and says it is his fault.

707
01:09:41,082 --> 01:09:41,682
But he doesn't really care
about anything

708
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:44,642
because he's so cold.

709
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:10,602
Where is she?

710
01:10:11,602 --> 01:10:12,202
Gone. All are gone.

711
01:10:16,162 --> 01:10:16,762
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

712
01:10:20,722 --> 01:10:21,322
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

713
01:10:24,482 --> 01:10:25,082
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

714
01:10:27,322 --> 01:10:27,922
How silent it is.

715
01:10:30,482 --> 01:10:31,082
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

716
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:34,642
And the punishment?

717
01:10:35,882 --> 01:10:36,482
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

718
01:10:39,682 --> 01:10:40,282
The usual?

719
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:41,962
Loneliness.

720
01:10:43,362 --> 01:10:43,962
Loneliness?

721
01:10:45,762 --> 01:10:46,362
Precisely.

722
01:10:49,322 --> 01:10:49,922
Is there no mercy?

723
01:10:51,522 --> 01:10:52,122
Don't ask me. I don't know.

724
01:11:15,122 --> 01:11:15,722
What's this?

725
01:11:17,682 --> 01:11:18,282
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

726
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:21,242
But it's still raining.

727
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:24,042
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

728
01:11:29,562 --> 01:11:30,162
Slept well?

729
01:11:30,762 --> 01:11:31,362
Yes, but recently I've had
the weirdest dreams,

730
01:11:41,322 --> 01:11:41,922
as if I  must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

731
01:11:45,762 --> 01:11:46,362
What's that?

732
01:11:48,482 --> 01:11:49,082
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

733
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:53,082
You and Evald are very alike.

734
01:11:55,842 --> 01:11:56,442
So you've said.

735
01:11:57,602 --> 01:11:58,202
He said the same thing.

736
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:00,882
About me?

737
01:12:02,442 --> 01:12:03,042
No. About himself.

738
01:12:04,282 --> 01:12:04,882
But he's only 38.

739
01:12:08,322 --> 01:12:08,922
May I tell you about it?

740
01:12:10,962 --> 01:12:11,562
Yes, I'd be grateful.

741
01:12:16,442 --> 01:12:17,042
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

742
01:12:20,922 --> 01:12:21,522
so he drove me down to the sea.

743
01:12:23,122 --> 01:12:23,722
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

744
01:12:29,482 --> 01:12:30,082
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

745
01:12:33,922 --> 01:12:34,522
Something unpleasant, of course.

746
01:12:37,522 --> 01:12:38,122
I wish I didn't have to.

747
01:12:39,682 --> 01:12:40,282
You have found someone else.

748
01:12:42,642 --> 01:12:43,242
Don't be childish.

749
01:12:44,602 --> 01:12:45,202
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

750
01:12:49,322 --> 01:12:49,922
and then you find it
hard to begin.

751
01:12:53,162 --> 01:12:53,762
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

752
01:12:59,162 --> 01:12:59,762
I almost want to laugh now.

753
01:13:01,122 --> 01:13:01,722
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

754
01:13:03,122 --> 01:13:03,722
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

755
01:13:07,442 --> 01:13:08,042
I'm going to have a baby.

756
01:13:11,922 --> 01:13:12,522
Are you sure?

757
01:13:13,562 --> 01:13:14,162
The doctor told me yesterday.

758
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:16,642
So that was the secret.

759
01:13:21,442 --> 01:13:22,042
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

760
01:13:26,962 --> 01:13:27,562
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

761
01:13:46,042 --> 01:13:46,642
You know I don't want a child.

762
01:13:48,202 --> 01:13:48,802
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

763
01:13:50,762 --> 01:13:51,362
- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!

764
01:13:54,642 --> 01:13:55,242
It's absurd to bring children
into this world

765
01:13:58,242 --> 01:13:58,842
and think they'll be better off
than we are.

766
01:14:01,242 --> 01:14:01,842
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

767
01:14:05,202 --> 01:14:05,802
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

768
01:14:09,562 --> 01:14:10,162
Is he even sure I'm his son?

769
01:14:12,562 --> 01:14:13,162
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

770
01:14:16,322 --> 01:14:16,922
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

771
01:14:17,962 --> 01:14:18,562
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

772
01:14:23,002 --> 01:14:23,602
You're a coward.

773
01:14:25,482 --> 01:14:26,082
Yes.

774
01:14:27,282 --> 01:14:27,882
This life sickens me.

775
01:14:29,562 --> 01:14:30,162
I will not be forced to take on

776
01:14:31,322 --> 01:14:31,922
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

777
01:14:34,282 --> 01:14:34,882
And you know
that I mean what I say.

778
01:14:51,522 --> 01:14:52,122
I know that this is wrong.

779
01:14:53,442 --> 01:14:54,042
There's neither right nor wrong.

780
01:14:55,922 --> 01:14:56,522
We act according to our needs.

781
01:15:00,122 --> 01:15:00,722
And what are they?

782
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:02,722
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

783
01:15:06,762 --> 01:15:07,362
And yours?

784
01:15:09,002 --> 01:15:09,602
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

785
01:15:25,882 --> 01:15:26,482
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

786
01:15:34,002 --> 01:15:34,602
Why have you told me all this?

787
01:15:39,282 --> 01:15:39,882
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

788
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:47,322
I don't understand.

789
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:51,522
I thought: That's his mother.

790
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:56,642
An old woman, cold as ice,

791
01:16:01,242 --> 01:16:01,842
more forbidding than death.

792
01:16:05,522 --> 01:16:06,122
And this is her son,

793
01:16:08,322 --> 01:16:08,922
and there are light-years
between them.

794
01:16:12,522 --> 01:16:13,122
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

795
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:17,882
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

796
01:16:24,362 --> 01:16:24,962
And I thought of the baby inside me.

797
01:16:28,362 --> 01:16:28,962
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

798
01:16:32,722 --> 01:16:33,322
and loneliness.

799
01:16:36,602 --> 01:16:37,202
It must end somewhere.

800
01:16:40,082 --> 01:16:40,682
But you're going back to Evald!

801
01:16:44,402 --> 01:16:45,002
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

802
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:48,162
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

803
01:16:51,682 --> 01:16:52,282
Not even the man
I love most ofall.

804
01:16:57,562 --> 01:16:58,162
Can I help you?

805
01:16:59,762 --> 01:17:00,362
No one can help me.

806
01:17:02,802 --> 01:17:03,402
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

807
01:17:06,802 --> 01:17:07,402
What happened after your talk?

808
01:17:09,762 --> 01:17:10,362
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

809
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:13,362
Hasn't he gotten in touch with you?

810
01:17:16,762 --> 01:17:17,362
- I don't want us to get--
- To get what?

811
01:17:23,282 --> 01:17:23,882
Like those two in the car today.

812
01:17:27,642 --> 01:17:28,242
I was just thinking of them.

813
01:17:30,802 --> 01:17:31,402
It reminded me of my own marriage.

814
01:17:35,082 --> 01:17:35,682
But we love each other.

815
01:17:37,002 --> 01:17:37,602
Long may he live
Long may he live

816
01:17:39,562 --> 01:17:40,162
May he live to be
a hundred years old

817
01:17:44,722 --> 01:17:45,322
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

818
01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:48,322
With these simple flowers
we want to say

819
01:17:52,002 --> 01:17:52,602
that we are very impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.

820
01:17:56,682 --> 01:17:57,282
We know you must be
a very wise old man

821
01:18:01,322 --> 01:18:01,922
who knows everything about life

822
01:18:04,082 --> 01:18:04,682
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

823
01:18:10,802 --> 01:18:11,402
Thank you.

824
01:18:14,522 --> 01:18:15,122
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

825
01:18:46,802 --> 01:18:47,402
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

826
01:18:51,522 --> 01:18:52,122
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

827
01:18:55,162 --> 01:18:55,762
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

828
01:18:59,162 --> 01:18:59,762
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

829
01:19:02,882 --> 01:19:03,482
Thank you.
That was most kind.

830
01:19:06,362 --> 01:19:06,962
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

831
01:19:08,362 --> 01:19:08,962
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

832
01:19:14,762 --> 01:19:15,362
Welcome, Father.

833
01:19:17,602 --> 01:19:18,202
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

834
01:19:19,722 --> 01:19:20,322
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

835
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:23,162
The guest room as usual, Father?

836
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:26,282
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

837
01:19:31,922 --> 01:19:32,522
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

838
01:19:34,882 --> 01:19:35,482
Who are those young people?

839
01:19:36,242 --> 01:19:36,842
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

840
01:19:38,562 --> 01:19:39,162
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

841
01:19:41,602 --> 01:19:42,202
It's a quarter past 4:00.

842
01:19:49,402 --> 01:19:50,002
I've bought you new shoelaces.

843
01:20:00,402 --> 01:20:00,962
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

844
01:20:02,842 --> 01:20:03,442
- Areyou going to a hotel?
- No, why?

845
01:20:05,362 --> 01:20:05,962
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

846
01:20:09,202 --> 01:20:09,762
- Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

847
01:20:12,322 --> 01:20:12,922
And unexpected.

848
01:20:14,322 --> 01:20:14,922
Same here.

849
01:20:16,122 --> 01:20:16,722
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

850
01:20:19,082 --> 01:20:19,682
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

851
01:20:31,242 --> 01:20:31,842
Hurry up, Professor!

852
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:08,882
During the ceremony,

853
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:13,962
my thoughts strayed
to the day's events,

854
01:22:18,042 --> 01:22:18,642
and it was then I decided

855
01:22:22,402 --> 01:22:23,002
to write down what had happened.

856
01:22:25,642 --> 01:22:26,242
In this jumble of events,

857
01:22:31,642 --> 01:22:32,242
I seemed to discern
an extraordinary logic.

858
01:23:01,522 --> 01:23:02,122
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

859
01:23:04,602 --> 01:23:05,202
Yes, thank you.

860
01:23:08,202 --> 01:23:08,802
Areyou tired, Miss Agda?

861
01:23:09,802 --> 01:23:10,402
I won't deny it.

862
01:23:11,522 --> 01:23:12,122
Take one of my sleeping pills.

863
01:23:16,402 --> 01:23:17,002
Miss Agda, I am sorry
about this morning.

864
01:23:21,842 --> 01:23:22,442
Are you ill, Professor?

865
01:23:23,882 --> 01:23:24,482
No. Why?

866
01:23:25,922 --> 01:23:26,522
I don't like the sound of it.

867
01:23:29,962 --> 01:23:30,562
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

868
01:23:35,002 --> 01:23:35,602
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

869
01:24:01,482 --> 01:24:02,082
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

870
01:24:06,002 --> 01:24:06,602
Miss Agda,

871
01:24:09,762 --> 01:24:10,362
as we have known each other

872
01:24:14,162 --> 01:24:14,762
for so many years,

873
01:24:16,402 --> 01:24:17,002
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

874
01:24:20,002 --> 01:24:20,602
No, I don't.

875
01:24:22,762 --> 01:24:23,362
Why not?

876
01:24:24,842 --> 01:24:25,442
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

877
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:29,122
No intimacies for me, thank you.

878
01:24:32,722 --> 01:24:33,322
It's all right between us as it is.

879
01:24:35,042 --> 01:24:35,642
But we are old now.

880
01:24:38,042 --> 01:24:38,642
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

881
01:24:43,522 --> 01:24:44,122
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

882
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:48,482
They would make fun of us.

883
01:24:49,882 --> 01:24:50,482
Are you always right?

884
01:24:53,402 --> 01:24:54,002
Almost always.

885
01:24:55,562 --> 01:24:56,162
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

886
01:25:07,722 --> 01:25:08,322
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

887
01:25:12,162 --> 01:25:12,762
You know where I am
if you want anything.

888
01:26:01,842 --> 01:26:02,442
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

889
01:26:05,642 --> 01:26:06,202
We were terribly proud
to know you.

890
01:26:07,682 --> 01:26:08,282
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

891
01:26:11,762 --> 01:26:12,362
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

892
01:26:14,762 --> 01:26:15,362
We just wanted to say good-bye.

893
01:26:16,642 --> 01:26:17,242
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

894
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:22,042
It's you I really love, you know.

895
01:26:23,802 --> 01:26:24,402
Today, tomorrow, always.

896
01:26:28,362 --> 01:26:28,962
I'll remember.

897
01:26:30,642 --> 01:26:31,242
Come on.

898
01:26:38,802 --> 01:26:39,442
We have to go now.

899
01:26:46,162 --> 01:26:46,762
Let me hear from you.

900
01:27:00,442 --> 01:27:01,042
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

901
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:05,362
Yes, Father?

902
01:27:06,122 --> 01:27:06,722
Areyou back already?

903
01:27:09,122 --> 01:27:09,682
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

904
01:27:13,522 --> 01:27:14,122
So you're going to the dance?

905
01:27:16,842 --> 01:27:17,442
I suppose so.

906
01:27:19,922 --> 01:27:20,522
- How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

907
01:27:23,082 --> 01:27:23,682
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

908
01:27:27,562 --> 01:27:28,162
Sleep well.

909
01:27:31,882 --> 01:27:32,482
Sit down a moment.

910
01:27:36,562 --> 01:27:37,162
Anything special?

911
01:27:39,762 --> 01:27:40,362
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

912
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:47,162
Forgive my asking.

913
01:27:48,322 --> 01:27:48,922
I don't know.

914
01:27:50,642 --> 01:27:51,242
It's not my business, but--

915
01:27:55,402 --> 01:27:56,002
But wouldn't it--

916
01:27:58,082 --> 01:27:58,682
I have asked her to stay with me.

917
01:28:00,202 --> 01:28:00,802
Shouldn't you-- I mean--

918
01:28:02,482 --> 01:28:03,082
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

919
01:28:06,882 --> 01:28:07,482
I can't live without her.
That's what I mean.

920
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:10,642
Oh, I see.

921
01:28:12,082 --> 01:28:12,682
It will be as she wants.

922
01:28:14,242 --> 01:28:14,842
And she--

923
01:28:17,602 --> 01:28:18,202
She says she'll think about it.

924
01:28:21,642 --> 01:28:22,242
About that debt of yours--

925
01:28:23,682 --> 01:28:24,282
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

926
01:28:26,002 --> 01:28:26,602
That's not what I meant.

927
01:28:31,082 --> 01:28:31,682
How are you, Uncle Isak?

928
01:28:32,562 --> 01:28:33,162
Fine.Just fine.

929
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:35,202
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

930
01:28:37,682 --> 01:28:38,282
They're very nice.

931
01:28:43,122 --> 01:28:43,722
Thanks for coming with me.

932
01:28:48,522 --> 01:28:49,122
I like you, Marianne.

933
01:28:52,082 --> 01:28:52,682
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

934
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:03,442
If I have been worried
or sad during the day,

935
01:29:07,522 --> 01:29:08,122
it often calms me
to recall childhood memories.

936
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:14,722
I did so on this evening too.

937
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:28,922
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

938
01:29:32,442 --> 01:29:33,042
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

939
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:35,402
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

940
01:29:37,922 --> 01:29:38,522
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

941
01:29:42,882 --> 01:29:43,482
Come, I'll help you.
