00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:56,097
<i>Find out the numbers
for this, will you?
Worldwide.</i>

148
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:11,482
<i>BRENNAN: I remember his face.</i>

149
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:15,319
<i>Staring out the window.</i>

150
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,053
<i>Down below him,
a liberal America
cheered, gloated.</i>

151
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:24,287
Hippies, draft dodgers,
dilettantes,

152
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:27,733
<i>the same people
who'd spit on me when
I got back from Vietnam.</i>

153
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:32,930
<i>They'd gotten rid
of Richard Nixon,
their bogeyman.</i>

154
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:48,646
<i>So what's so important
that it couldn't wait,
that it had to be today?</i>

155
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:53,159
<i>I've had an idea, John,
rather a bold idea
for an interview.</i>

156
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:54,694
<i>Fish and chips, please.</i>

157
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:56,161
<i>And in a moment...</i>

158
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,595
<i>Well, it's too late now.
It's done.</i>

159
00:08:57,665 --> 00:08:58,996
<i>I've called his people...</i>

160
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:00,226
You?

161
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,667
<i>Beans, peas and lamb, please.</i>

162
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,203
<i>And made an offer.</i>

163
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:08,731
Now, if the subject
were to say yes,

164
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:16,139
<i>well, he's rather
a big fish that swims
in not-untricky waters.</i>

165
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,416
<i>So it goes without saying
that I'd want a dear friend</i>

166
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:23,322
<i>and the finest producer
I know by my side.</i>

167
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:29,657
So who is it?

168
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,863
<i>Richard Nixon.</i>

169
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:35,597
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?

170
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:38,070
<i>Well, come on,
don't look like that.</i>

171
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,800
Well, how would you
expect me to look?

172
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,140
<i>I spent yesterday
evening watching you
interview the Bee Gees.</i>

173
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:45,076
<i>Weren't they terrific?</i>

174
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:49,139
<i>Come on, John,
we've done political
interviews before.</i>

175
00:09:50,418 --> 00:09:52,909
So, okay, so what
kind of interview?

176
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:58,221
<i>A full, extensive
look-back over his life,
his presidency.</i>

177
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,852
And?

178
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:01,361
<i>And what?
Come on, David.</i>

179
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:02,896
Surely the only thing
that would interest anyone

180
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:05,296
<i>about Richard Nixon
would be a confession.</i>

181
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:07,130
<i>A full,
no-holds-barred
confession.</i>

182
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:09,432
<i>Well, we'll get that, too.</i>

183
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:10,493
From Richard Nixon?

184
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:11,903
<i>Come on, John.</i>

185
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:14,271
<i>Just think of the
numbers it would get.</i>

186
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,671
Do you know how
many people watched

187
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:18,372
his farewell speech
in the White House?

188
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:20,471
<i>Four hundred million.</i>

189
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,841
<i>But in the end,
David heard nothing.</i>

190
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,580
And soon after
arriving in California,

191
00:10:25,654 --> 00:10:29,249
<i>Nixon was rushed
to hospital with an acute
attack of phlebitis.</i>

192
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:45,139
<i>I think it was
around this time
that Gerald Ford,</i>

193
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,230
who was the new President,

194
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:48,368
and who was desperate
to move the agenda
on from Watergate,

195
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:51,538
<i>gave Nixon a full,
free and absolute pardon.</i>

196
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:54,344
<i>Now therefore, I,
Gerald R. Ford,</i>

197
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:57,079
<i>President of
the United States,</i>

198
00:10:57,153 --> 00:11:01,089
<i>have granted,
and by these presents
do grant,</i>

199
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,682
<i>a full,
free and absolute pardon</i>

200
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,957
<i>unto Richard Nixon
for all offenses
against the United States.</i>

201
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,431
It meant that the man
who had committed
the greatest felony

202
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,162
<i>in American political history
would never stand trial.</i>

203
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,636
<i>It was like he slipped
out the back door.</i>

204
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:19,636
<i>A public opinion
poll indicates</i>

205
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:23,076
<i>a two-to-one disapproval
of the pardoning
of Richard Nixon.</i>

206
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:26,342
<i>CHANCELLOR: One telegram
from Virginia said,
"Roosevelt had his New Deal,</i>

207
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:30,010
<i>"Truman had his Fair Deal,
now Ford has
his crooked deal."</i>

208
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:32,076
<i>There was no deal, period.</i>

209
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:34,520
<i>I don't think the truth
will ever come out.</i>

210
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,251
<i>The American people
need to know the truth,</i>

211
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:39,557
<i>and I don't think
it will ever now
be fully known.</i>

212
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:05,519
GANNON: So how do we
want to address
the college protests?

213
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:06,783
Well, do we want
to lift some quotes

214
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:09,985
<i>from the "stand up
and be counted" speech
in 1970?</i>

215
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,687
<i>Sir?
GANNON: You know, maybe
we're just better off</i>

216
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:13,286
<i>using the whole
Lincoln Memorial memo.</i>

217
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:14,830
<i>SAWYER: Just include
the whole thing.</i>

218
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:17,365
<i>Mr. President,
Swifty Lazar is here.</i>

219
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:19,697
<i>Okay. No, no, stick around.</i>

220
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:21,965
<i>You're gonna get
a kick out of this.</i>

221
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,270
<i>This is my literary agent
from Hollywood.</i>

222
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:27,537
<i>Hygiene obsessive.</i>

223
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:33,007
<i>Mr. President,
good to see you.</i>

224
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,710
<i>Nice to see you.</i>

225
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:37,379
<i>These are folks
helping me with my book.</i>

226
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:40,354
<i>Diane Sawyer,
Frank Gannon,
Irving Lazar.</i>

227
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:41,981
<i>Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.</i>

228
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:43,787
<i>Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.</i>

229
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:49,724
<i>Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.</i>

230
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,792
SWIFTY: So how
you feeling, sir?

231
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:56,765
<i>I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet
well enough to golf,</i>

232
00:12:57,608 --> 00:13:00,475
<i>thank God.
I despise that game.</i>

233
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:04,003
Imagine, six weeks
out of office

234
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:06,606
as President
of the United States,

235
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:09,551
<i>and they'd have me putting
in my hospital room.</i>

236
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,611
<i>Never retire, Mr. Lazar.</i>

237
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:16,993
<i>To me, the unhappiest
people of the world
are retired.</i>

238
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,858
<i>No purpose.</i>

239
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,694
<i>What makes life mean
something is purpose.</i>

240
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:24,666
<i>A goal. A battle. A struggle.</i>

241
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:26,965
<i>Well, even if
you don't win it.</i>

242
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:29,962
When my doctor
declared me unfit

243
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,872
to give testimony
in the Watergate trial,

244
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:34,173
<i>everybody thought
I'd be relieved.</i>

245
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:35,837
<i>Well, they were wrong.</i>

246
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:37,437
<i>That was the lowest I got.</i>

247
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:41,952
<i>Well, if it's a challenge
you want, here's one
you might enjoy.</i>

248
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,955
<i>How to spend $2 million,
2.3 to be precise.</i>

249
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:47,819
<i>It's what I got
for your memoirs.</i>

250
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,358
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

251
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:50,688
<i>Eh...</i>

252
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:52,524
It might be a little short
of what I wanted,

253
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:56,158
<i>but let me assure you,
it's a whole lot more
than they wanted.</i>

254
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:58,260
<i>That book is important to me.</i>

255
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,034
<i>It's probably the only
chance I'm gonna get
to put the record straight</i>

256
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,474
<i>and remind people
the Nixon years
weren't all bad.</i>

257
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:10,846
<i>You know, if you're trying
to put the record straight,</i>

258
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:12,382
<i>I'd at least talk to him.</i>

259
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,576
NIXON: Who?

260
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:17,351
<i>David Frost.
English talk show guy.</i>

261
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,991
Why would I want to
talk to David Frost?

262
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,857
<i>Well, a while back,
he wrote asking
for an interview.</i>

263
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,260
<i>No.</i>

264
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,661
<i>Well, we didn't
get back to him.</i>

265
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,064
<i>Frankly, we didn't
find him appropriate.</i>

266
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,897
<i>Well, I thought
that we were
doing one with CBS.</i>

267
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:33,937
<i>We are. I just figured
doing it with Frost</i>

268
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,132
<i>would be a whole lot
easier than doing it
with Mike Wallace.</i>

269
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:40,541
<i>It would, but it would
have a lot less,
you know, credibility.</i>

270
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:44,139
<i>True, true. Could
probably get more money.</i>

271
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,715
<i>Really?
Look.</i>

272
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:52,188
<i>We'll always have
350 on the table
from CBS.</i>

273
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:55,987
But if I could get
Frost to pay more
and secure better terms,

274
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:58,587
<i>it might be a shame to pass.</i>

275
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:02,360
<i>It'd be interesting to know
where he is right now.</i>

276
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,394
<i>We tied him to
railway tracks,
and he escaped.</i>

277
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,737
<i>We buried him alive,
and he walked free.</i>

278
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:13,211
<i>Today we're lowering
escape artist Derek Harrison
into the water</i>

279
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,612
<i>to see if he can
miraculously
cheat death once more.</i>

280
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,117
<i>Good evening,
and welcome to
Great Escapes.</i>

281
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,119
<i>My name is David Frost.</i>

282
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,748
<i>DIRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut.</i>

283
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:26,916
<i>Thank you.</i>

284
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,292
<i>In any deal, you need to
know your opponent's
breaking point.</i>

285
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,393
To assess that,
you might call them

286
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,696
<i>late at night
or at the weekend.</i>

287
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:39,169
<i>If they take the call,
you know they're desperate.</i>

288
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,674
<i>And from that moment on,
you know you have
the upper hand.</i>

289
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,108
(PHONE RINGING)

290
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:54,913
Hello?

291
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,683
<i>Mr. Frost? Irving Lazar.</i>

292
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,547
Who?

293
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,788
<i>Swifty Lazar.
I represent
President Nixon.</i>

294
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,123
What time is it?

295
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,185
<i>Bad time?</i>

296
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,062
<i>(STUTTERING) No! Not at all.</i>

297
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,971
<i>I'm calling with regard
to your request
for an interview</i>

298
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,034
and to say,
having considered it,

299
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:22,105
<i>my client is not
necessarily opposed
to the idea.</i>

300
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,912
<i>Really?
Well, that's
terrific news!</i>

301
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,714
<i>For God's sake.</i>

302
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,846
<i>SWIFTY: I got $500,000.</i>

303
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,322
Is that good?

304
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:36,021
<i>Mr. President,
it's a half a million dollars
for a news interview.</i>

305
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,357
<i>It's unprecedented.</i>

306
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,625
<i>Yeah? Well, what's the catch?</i>

307
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,863
<i>With Frost? None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.</i>

308
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:46,065
<i>This guy'll be so grateful
to be getting it at all,</i>

309
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,834
<i>he'll pitch
puffballs all night</i>

310
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,740
<i>and pay a half
a million dollars
for the privilege.</i>

311
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,479
Well, you think
you could get 550?

312
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,115
<i>I got 6.</i>

313
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,685
BIRT: David, how could
you have done that?
What?

314
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>$600,000. That's a fortune.</i>

315
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:05,747
200 on signature?

316
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,293
<i>Don't worry about the money.</i>

317
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,727
<i>My God.
Most Americans think
he belongs in jail.</i>

318
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:11,491
<i>You're making him
a rich man.</i>

319
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,498
<i>Plus, by outbidding them,
you've already made enemies</i>

320
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,056
<i>of the networks.
They're just jealous.</i>

321
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,659
<i>They're already sounding off
about checkbook journalism.</i>

322
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,170
And if the networks
are against you,

323
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,637
<i>syndication's always
going to be a struggle.</i>

324
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,265
<i>No syndication,
no advance sales.</i>

325
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,867
<i>No advance sales,
no commercials.</i>

326
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,377
<i>No commercials, no revenue.</i>

327
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:29,110
<i>And here's the bigger
question, why do it?
You don't need it.</i>

328
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:30,310
<i>Your career's
in great shape.</i>

329
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:32,546
This will just spread you
across three continents,

330
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,211
<i>jeopardize the other shows.</i>

331
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,687
<i>Isn't it true that
Channel Nine in Australia</i>

332
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:37,451
want you to do
another season
of your talk show for them?

333
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,582
<i>Yes.
And London, too?</i>

334
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,786
<i>Yes, but that would be
London and Australia.</i>

335
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,624
<i>This would be...
What?</i>

336
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,720
<i>You wouldn't
understand, John.</i>

337
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,631
You were never
part of the show
in New York,

338
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,065
<i>but it's indescribable.</i>

339
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:55,201
<i>Success in America
is unlike success
anywhere else.</i>

340
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,668
<i>And the emptiness
when it's gone.</i>

341
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,518
<i>And the sickening
thought that it may
never come back.</i>

342
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,819
<i>You know, there's
a restaurant in New York
called Sardi's.</i>

343
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,652
<i>Ordinary mortals
can't get a table.</i>

344
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,419
John, the place
was my canteen!

345
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:13,585
<i>You know, I'd be happier</i>

346
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,889
if I heard
some kind of vision

347
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,123
<i>that you had
for this interview.</i>

348
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:17,357
<i>MAN: Excuse me, Mr. Frost.</i>

349
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:18,557
<i>I'd heard you were
going to be here.</i>

350
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,566
<i>Would you mind?
Of course.</i>

351
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,124
<i>But I don't.
I just hear
a man doing it</i>

352
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,464
because it would
create headlines

353
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,630
<i>or give him a place
at the top table.</i>

354
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,071
<i>And that is what
makes me nervous.</i>

355
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:29,871
<i>And you do nervous
so beautifully, John.</i>

356
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,243
<i>"Hello, good evening
and welcome."</i>

357
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,239
(FROST LAUGHS)

358
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,386
<i>I don't actually say that.</i>

359
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,012
<i>Hello, Mr. Frost.</i>

360
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:47,822
Champagne?

361
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:49,591
<i>CAROLINE: No, thank you.</i>

362
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:52,657
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Another glass, sir?

363
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:12,346
<i>You don't like champagne?</i>

364
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:15,380
<i>Not on airplanes.</i>

365
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:17,755
<i>Yes, it dehydrates
one terribly.</i>

366
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:21,255
<i>The trick is to have
a glass of water
on the go, too.</i>

367
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,854
<i>Like the Viennese
serve coffee.</i>

368
00:19:23,932 --> 00:19:26,196
<i>Well, I've never
been to Vienna.</i>

369
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:28,735
<i>Oh. Well, you'd like it.</i>

370
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:31,829
<i>It's like Paris
without the French.</i>

371
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,401
<i>What's your name?</i>

372
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:37,672
<i>Caroline.</i>

373
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:38,769
<i>David.</i>

374
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:41,544
<i>Yes, I know. David Frost.</i>

375
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:45,349
<i>"Hello and good evening
and welcome."</i>

376
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:53,789
<i>You know, I heard
an interview with you
recently on the radio.</i>

377
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:56,195
<i>You were giving it
from the back
of your Rolls-Royce.</i>

378
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:57,391
<i>Bentley.</i>

379
00:19:57,466 --> 00:19:58,524
<i>On the phone.</i>

380
00:19:58,601 --> 00:19:59,863
They said that
you were a person

381
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,961
<i>who defined
the age we live in.</i>

382
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:04,630
<i>Really?
Mmm.</i>

383
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:06,766
<i>You and Vidal Sassoon.</i>

384
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:11,445
But what made you
exceptional, they said,

385
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:15,450
was that you were a person
who had achieved great fame

386
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:18,885
<i>without possessing
any discernible quality.</i>

387
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:20,182
<i>How kind.
Mmm-hmm.</i>

388
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:23,555
<i>And that you fly
around a great deal.</i>

389
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,924
<i>Well, that's true.</i>

390
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:27,818
Why?

391
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:29,387
<i>I like to keep busy.</i>

392
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:31,431
Why?

393
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,060
<i>I find it
more interesting
than keeping still.</i>

394
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:37,071
<i>You know,
you have very sad eyes.</i>

395
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:39,570
<i>Do I?
Mmm.</i>

396
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,633
Has anyone told
you that before?

397
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:43,440
<i>No.</i>

398
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:45,173
Are you a sad person?

399
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:51,612
<i>Let's talk about
you a little bit.</i>

400
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:54,179
<i>Of course, you feel more
comfortable asking questions.</i>

401
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:56,191
How right you are!

402
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:58,254
<i>This is your
captain speaking.</i>

403
00:20:58,327 --> 00:20:59,316
<i>You may have
noticed we've begun</i>

404
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:01,523
<i>our final descent
into Los Angeles.</i>

405
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:05,492
<i>If you could please
return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts,</i>

406
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:07,628
<i>we'll be landing
very shortly. Thank you.</i>

407
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:10,002
CAROLINE: So how about you?
Where are you going?

408
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:12,439
<i>To meet Richard Nixon.</i>

409
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,737
Really?

410
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:18,210
You know, they say he has
the most enormous head,

411
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:20,239
<i>but the sexiest voice.</i>

412
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:21,681
Where is he now?

413
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:25,479
In some dark underground cave
licking his wounds?

414
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:29,120
<i>Actually, no.
In his rather smart
beachside villa</i>

415
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:30,250
<i>in California.</i>

416
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:33,057
Really? Richard Nixon
in a beachside villa?

417
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:34,721
<i>How incongruous.</i>

418
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:36,766
<i>You can come if you'd like.</i>

419
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:38,928
To meet Nixon?

420
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:41,364
Why not?

421
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:44,035
Are you sure?

422
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:48,772
<i>You know, I would love that.</i>

423
00:21:48,845 --> 00:21:51,006
<i>PILOT: Cabin crew,
please prepare for arrival.</i>

424
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:53,948
<i>Well, I'll get
my office to call you
first thing in the morning</i>

425
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:56,577
<i>and send a car with a phone.</i>

426
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:57,642
<i>Oh.</i>

427
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:03,151
<i>He did, too. Money no object.</i>

428
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:07,219
<i>Everything glittered
and was golden.</i>

429
00:22:07,297 --> 00:22:08,764
<i>Well, on the outside.</i>

430
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:11,666
<i>Of course, what I didn't know
was that in the meantime,</i>

431
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:13,897
<i>he'd gone to all
the major networks</i>

432
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:16,439
<i>to try and get
interest in the interviews.</i>

433
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:19,841
<i>I'm sorry, David,
but we have a policy</i>

434
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,344
<i>of not paying
for a news interview.</i>

435
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:25,576
<i>Look, we love your work
as an entertainer.</i>

436
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,776
<i>That Guinness show?</i>

437
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:28,340
<i>Love it. You're a funny guy.</i>

438
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:30,613
But an interview like this?

439
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:33,588
<i>You're asking us to pay
a British talk show host</i>

440
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:35,888
to interview
an American president

441
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,623
with absolutely no
editorial controls
whatsoever in return?

442
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:41,665
<i>Well, you can't say
it's not a fresh approach.</i>

443
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,461
<i>I know you're very busy.</i>

444
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:45,535
<i>I'm not gonna
keep you from it.</i>

445
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,762
<i>Thank you for coming in.</i>

446
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:49,931
<i>I'm gonna have to
get back to you.</i>

447
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:52,873
<i>Okay, thank you so
much for your time.</i>

448
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:54,000
<i>David, good luck.</i>

449
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:56,443
He never let on
to anyone at the time,

450
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:57,708
<i>not even me.
You know,
that would have meant...</i>

451
00:22:58,616 --> 00:22:59,605
<i>Thanks.</i>

452
00:22:59,684 --> 00:23:03,245
<i>...admitting failure,
and David doesn't do failure.</i>

453
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:36,286
<i>FROST: There you are.</i>

454
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:38,845
<i>See, you don't have
to do a thing yourself.</i>

455
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:44,192
(INDISTINCT)

456
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:59,267
<i>Well.</i>

457
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,070
<i>You found it okay.</i>

458
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:02,271
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

459
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:03,506
<i>Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Frost.</i>

460
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:04,673
<i>And you, sir.</i>

461
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:06,273
May I present
Caroline Cushing?

462
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,408
<i>Miss Cushing.</i>

463
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:09,579
<i>Hello.
Your house is
very beautiful.</i>

464
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:10,814
<i>Really. Very romantic.</i>

465
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:11,981
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

466
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:13,888
<i>And my producer, John Birt.</i>

467
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,483
<i>Nice to meet you.
How do you do?</i>

468
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,997
<i>This is Mr. Lazar,
and this is Jack Brennan.</i>

469
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:21,396
Now, Miss Cushing,
would you like
to take a tour,

470
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:23,764
you know,
maybe stretch your legs
after your long journey?

471
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:26,497
<i>Yes, please.
I'd love that. Thank you.</i>

472
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,598
<i>Come on in.
This is my office.</i>

473
00:24:29,674 --> 00:24:33,805
<i>Now, this is where Brezhnev
and I had our summit.</i>

474
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,249
<i>Yeah. Brezhnev was there,
and Gromyko there,
Dobrynin there.</i>

475
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:42,410
<i>We talked for
nine hours straight.</i>

476
00:24:43,622 --> 00:24:47,114
After the meeting,
as a souvenir of the visit,

477
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:51,458
<i>I remember that we had
a Lincoln specially made.</i>

478
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,727
<i>Dark blue,
cherry wood, leather.</i>

479
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,463
Well, we got inside
for the photographers,

480
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,803
<i>when the next thing you know,
he steps on the gas.</i>

481
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:06,606
Now, the first rule
of political life is

482
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:11,115
<i>you never let a president
get behind the wheel
of a car, ever.</i>

483
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:13,174
<i>I mean, we're not
used to doing anything</i>

484
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:15,219
<i>for ourselves,
let alone drive.</i>

485
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:18,484
And the Chairman, Jesus,
the way he put his foot down,

486
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:21,322
my guess is
the last thing he drove was

487
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,420
<i>a tractor on some
Ukrainian potato farm.</i>

488
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,891
<i>He crashed into curbs.</i>

489
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:29,457
<i>He went over speed bumps.</i>

490
00:25:29,535 --> 00:25:32,436
<i>He went twice
around my whole estate.</i>

491
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:37,306
Finally, we ended up
at some remote point
on the coast,

492
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:40,311
<i>out there
overlooking the sea.</i>

493
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:44,578
He turns off the gas,
and he talks for two hours

494
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:48,109
<i>about his favorite subject,
steel mills.</i>

495
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:50,952
<i>He said, "Mr. President,
most politicians</i>

496
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:53,719
<i>"have tragedy
in their early lives."</i>

497
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:58,825
<i>Well, I told him that
I lost two brothers
to tuberculosis.</i>

498
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:03,892
<i>And he watched his father
die from the cancer
he caught in the steelworks.</i>

499
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:09,174
<i>He was a sad man
and a noble adversary.</i>

500
00:26:09,843 --> 00:26:12,209
<i>I wouldn't want to
be a Russian leader.</i>

501
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:15,078
<i>They never know when
they're being taped.</i>

502
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:22,517
<i>Okay, I guess that's
it then, huh?</i>

503
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:24,385
<i>Until March.
I look forward to it.</i>

504
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,322
<i>Well, thank you,
Mr. President. So do I.</i>

505
00:26:26,392 --> 00:26:28,019
<i>You know,
it's a funny thing that</i>

506
00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:31,792
<i>I've never been
challenged to a duel before.</i>

507
00:26:31,865 --> 00:26:33,127
<i>I guess that's what this is.</i>

508
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,135
<i>FROST: Yeah, well, not really.</i>

509
00:26:36,204 --> 00:26:37,795
<i>Of course it is.</i>

510
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,601
<i>And I like that.</i>

511
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,846
<i>No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.</i>

512
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:54,882
<i>Mr. Frost, there's still
the small matter of the...</i>

513
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:57,653
<i>Of course.</i>

514
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:01,560
<i>I do beg your pardon.</i>

515
00:27:11,872 --> 00:27:17,140
<i>Right. $200,000.</i>

516
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,379
<i>I do hope that isn't coming
out of your own pocket.</i>

517
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,541
<i>Well, believe me,
sir, I wish my pockets
were that deep.</i>

518
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:26,246
Made out in the name of?

519
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,446
<i>Irving Paul Lazar.</i>

520
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,352
<i>Richard M. Nixon.</i>

521
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,491
<i>Here you go.</i>

522
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:42,667
<i>MANOLO: Okay, smile.</i>

523
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,303
<i>There. Now you can
put that in your
apartment in New York,</i>

524
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,936
<i>and all your liberal friends
can use it as a dartboard.</i>

525
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:54,709
<i>Well, actually,
I'm living in Monte Carlo
at the moment.</i>

526
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:56,181
Really?

527
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,081
<i>Yes. Goodbye, Mr. President.</i>

528
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:02,556
<i>Hey. Take my advice.</i>

529
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:04,183
<i>You should marry that woman.</i>

530
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:07,489
<i>Yes. Lovely, isn't she?</i>

531
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:10,531
<i>More important than that,
she comes from Monaco.</i>

532
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,623
<i>They pay no taxes there.</i>

533
00:28:13,935 --> 00:28:15,869
<i>Bye-bye.
Goodbye.</i>

534
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:26,006
<i>I bet you it did.</i>

535
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,104
What?

536
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:28,581
<i>Come out of his own pocket.</i>

537
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:30,777
<i>You know, he couldn't
look me in the eye.</i>

538
00:28:30,852 --> 00:28:32,479
<i>Well, I hear
the networks
aren't biting.</i>

539
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:34,646
<i>Without the networks,
the ad agencies
don't want to know.</i>

540
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:35,950
<i>So if you ask me,
there's a good chance</i>

541
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:37,184
<i>this whole thing
may never happen.</i>

542
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:42,457
Really?
So that meeting we just had
might have cost him $200,000?

543
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,622
<i>Correct.</i>

544
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:47,957
<i>Had I known that,
I would have offered
him a cup of tea.</i>

545
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,836
Say, did you
notice his shoes?

546
00:28:50,905 --> 00:28:51,931
<i>No.</i>

547
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:55,499
<i>Italian. No laces.
What do you think?</i>

548
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:58,711
<i>My people tried to get me
to wear a pair like that.</i>

549
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:01,341
<i>I think a man's shoes
should have laces, sir.</i>

550
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,574
You do?

551
00:29:02,651 --> 00:29:06,212
<i>Yeah. Personally,
I find those Italian
shoes very effeminate.</i>

552
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:09,348
<i>Yes, quite right.</i>

553
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:14,354
<i>NBC EXECUTIVE: I'm sorry,
David, but it's a no.</i>

554
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,159
<i>Try to look at it
from our point of view.</i>

555
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:19,166
<i>Why would an American network
hire a total outsider,</i>

556
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:22,499
<i>and someone who's already
had his own show canceled,
incidentally?</i>

557
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:24,095
<i>I see. Well, I'm sorry
you feel this way.</i>

558
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:27,040
<i>Obviously,
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.</i>

559
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:31,010
<i>NBC.</i>

560
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:36,509
<i>Well, that's
the networks out,
all of them.</i>

561
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:40,180
<i>Well, that's the
end of that, then.</i>

562
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,157
<i>I'm sorry, David.</i>

563
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,627
<i>Not so fast.</i>

564
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:53,558
<i>Where's your
adventurer's spirit?</i>

565
00:29:53,635 --> 00:29:55,603
The idea is
we pay for the program

566
00:29:55,671 --> 00:30:00,698
<i>and syndicate it
ourselves, completely
bypassing the networks.</i>

567
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:03,371
<i>Just imagine it,
we'd be our own
network for the night.</i>

568
00:30:03,446 --> 00:30:05,346
<i>Hey, Bob.
FROST: How does that grab you?</i>

569
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:07,280
<i>Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.</i>

570
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,181
<i>FROST: No, never been
done before.</i>

571
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:10,844
<i>Historic stuff.</i>

572
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:17,318
<i>Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.</i>

573
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:19,451
<i>Yeah?
Yeah.</i>

574
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:22,555
<i>David, I'd like you
to meet Jim Reston
and Bob Zelnick,</i>

575
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:23,825
<i>our two prospective
corner men.</i>

576
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:24,991
<i>Delighted to meet you.</i>

577
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:26,865
<i>Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.</i>

578
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:28,267
<i>Bob's been
Washington correspondent</i>

579
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:29,635
<i>for Public Radio
for the past 10 years.</i>

580
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:31,901
<i>Moving to ABC
in the new year.</i>

581
00:30:31,975 --> 00:30:33,306
The general feeling, David,

582
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:37,176
<i>is that I have been
wasting my matinee idol
looks on radio.</i>

583
00:30:37,814 --> 00:30:39,805
Jim here teaches
at the University
of North Carolina

584
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:43,717
and is writing a book
about the criminal
dishonesty, corruption,

585
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,853
<i>paranoia and abuses of
power of Richard Nixon.</i>

586
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:48,389
<i>Second on the subject.</i>

587
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:49,516
<i>Fourth.</i>

588
00:30:49,592 --> 00:30:51,651
<i>Well, delighted to
have you both aboard.</i>

589
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:54,162
Actually, before I sign on,
I would like to hear

590
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,097
<i>what you were
hoping to achieve
with this interview.</i>

591
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,691
What I want to achieve?

592
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:01,031
<i>Yeah.</i>

593
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:05,201
<i>Jim, well,
I've secured 12 taping days.</i>

594
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:07,209
<i>That's close to 30 hours</i>

595
00:31:07,277 --> 00:31:09,471
with the most compelling
and controversial politician

596
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:11,309
<i>of our times.</i>

597
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:12,849
<i>Isn't that enough?</i>

598
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:16,083
<i>Well, not for me.</i>

599
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:20,754
<i>Look, I'd be giving up
a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family</i>

600
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:23,487
to work on
a subject matter
that means more

601
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:25,256
than you can
probably imagine,

602
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:26,421
and the idea
of doing all that

603
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:29,933
without achieving what
I want to, personally,

604
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,762
<i>would be unthinkable to me.</i>

605
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:33,063
<i>(INTERRUPTING)
FROST: No, all right.</i>

606
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:36,500
Well, what is it that
you want to achieve?

607
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:45,115
<i>I'd like to
give Richard Nixon
the trial he never had.</i>

608
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:48,447
<i>Of course,
we'll be asking
difficult questions.</i>

609
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,180
<i>Difficult questions.</i>

610
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:53,316
The man lost 21,000 Americans

611
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,823
<i>and a million Indo-Chinese
during his administration.</i>

612
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:58,690
<i>He only escaped jail
because of Ford's pardon.</i>

613
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:02,061
Yes, but equally,
going after him
in some knee-jerk way,

614
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:05,659
<i>you know, assuming
he's a terrible guy,</i>

615
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:09,433
<i>wouldn't that only create
more sympathy for him
than anything else?</i>

616
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:10,973
<i>(SIGHS) You know...</i>

617
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:14,974
<i>Right now,
I submit it's impossible</i>

618
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:18,537
<i>to feel anything
close to sympathy
for Richard Nixon.</i>

619
00:32:18,616 --> 00:32:20,743
He devalued the presidency,

620
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:24,414
<i>and he left the country
that elected him in trauma.</i>

621
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:29,254
<i>The American people
need a conviction,
pure and simple.</i>

622
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:32,023
The integrity of
our political system,

623
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:37,933
<i>of democracy as an idea,
entirely depends on it.</i>

624
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,300
And if in years to come,
people look back

625
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:41,770
and say it was
in this interview

626
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,431
that Richard Nixon
exonerated himself,

627
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:45,702
<i>that would be
the worst crime of all.</i>

628
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,480
Did you know that
Mike Wallace is doing
a piece on this?

629
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:03,120
And that in the bars around
Capitol Hill and Georgetown

630
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:04,956
this entire project is a joke?

631
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:07,691
<i>ZELNICK: Come on.
Jim, come on.</i>

632
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:10,097
<i>Thanks for that, Jim.</i>

633
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:13,468
Could you give us
a couple of minutes?

634
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:22,202
<i>You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.</i>

635
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,509
<i>You know, Jim,
I went way out
on a limb for you.</i>

636
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:26,173
<i>I mean, some of us
actually want this job.</i>

637
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,741
<i>I want it, too,
if it's done right.</i>

638
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,616
<i>Well, how do you know
they're not
gonna do it right?</i>

639
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:30,916
Little Lord Fauntleroy
in there?

640
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:32,183
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?

641
00:33:32,257 --> 00:33:33,884
<i>What the...
He's full of shit, man!</i>

642
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,484
How do you know that?

643
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:40,666
Is Mike Wallace
doing a piece on this?

644
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:42,958
<i>Apparently.</i>

645
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:44,662
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

646
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:46,803
<i>It isn't relevant.</i>

647
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:51,637
<i>What's the angle?
"British talk show host,</i>

648
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,141
<i>"good with actresses,
not so good with
stonewalling presidents."</i>

649
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,246
<i>That's the general idea, yeah.</i>

650
00:33:58,317 --> 00:33:59,511
<i>Right.</i>

651
00:34:00,753 --> 00:34:03,483
<i>It's hard not to feel
a little insulted by that.</i>

652
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:07,659
<i>Well, Bob's obviously a pro.</i>

653
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:08,921
What are we gonna
do about Reston?

654
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:10,552
<i>Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.</i>

655
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:11,890
<i>Send him home.</i>

656
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,266
<i>Well, I think
he should stay.
Why?</i>

657
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,632
<i>I liked his passion.</i>

658
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:20,694
<i>He will drive us
all bloody mad.</i>

659
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,970
Well, maybe, but sometimes
being out of your comfort zone

660
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:26,705
<i>is a good thing, I'm told.</i>

661
00:34:27,747 --> 00:34:29,009
<i>He stays.</i>

662
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:43,721
<i>I took my seat
next to Mrs. Mao
at the banquet table.</i>

663
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:49,063
<i>Now, one of the challenges
of life as a president</i>

664
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:56,698
<i>is the endless round
of cocktail parties,
social engagements, banquets.</i>

665
00:34:57,443 --> 00:34:59,434
<i>And people who
know me would tell you</i>

666
00:34:59,512 --> 00:35:03,744
<i>that small talk is not one of
my strong suits, either. No.</i>

667
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:07,511
<i>Particularly not in Mandarin.</i>

668
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:15,518
<i>So Mrs. Mao and I,
we just, well, you know,
stared at one another.</i>

669
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:20,962
<i>And then across the table,
Mrs. Nixon and
Chairman Mao himself, well,</i>

670
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:24,167
<i>they stared
at one another, too.</i>

671
00:35:24,236 --> 00:35:27,103
<i>And then further down,
Dr. Kissinger</i>

672
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:30,006
<i>and their
foreign minister, well,</i>

673
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:33,536
<i>you're getting
the picture now.</i>

674
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:40,185
<i>I can't stand it, Jack!</i>

675
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:46,653
<i>Reducing the presidency
to a series
of banal anecdotes.</i>

676
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:49,660
<i>I feel like
a circus animal
doing tricks.</i>

677
00:35:49,863 --> 00:35:51,626
And I thought
I made it clear!

678
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:56,227
<i>I didn't want to take
any questions
on Watergate, damn it!</i>

679
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:00,038
Soon as it came
to question time,

680
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:04,737
all those sons of bitches
ever want to hear about
is Watergate!

681
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:09,305
<i>It's as if all
my other achievements
have ceased to exist.</i>

682
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:10,644
<i>Well, sir, you're
gonna get a chance</i>

683
00:36:10,717 --> 00:36:12,014
<i>to talk about them
sooner than you think.</i>

684
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:13,746
Yeah? How?

685
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,220
<i>Frost got there.
He got the money.</i>

686
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:18,923
What?

687
00:36:18,992 --> 00:36:20,460
<i>I understand
most of it's borrowed,</i>

688
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:22,291
<i>that his friends
have bailed him out.</i>

689
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,558
<i>But the point is,
we start taping
at the end of March.</i>

690
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:27,361
<i>Really? Now, that's terrific.</i>

691
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:29,197
How much time is
devoted to Watergate?

692
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:32,136
<i>25%. Just one of
four 90-minute shows.</i>

693
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:34,196
What are the other
three divided into?

694
00:36:34,274 --> 00:36:36,299
Domestic Affairs,
Foreign Policy,

695
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:37,434
<i>and Nixon the Man.</i>

696
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:38,500
<i>"Nixon the Man"?</i>

697
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,739
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?

698
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:43,978
<i>Well, I imagine
it's some kind of
biographical piece.</i>

699
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:49,912
<i>I can see it now.
The father that neglected me,
the brothers that died.</i>

700
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,049
<i>Spare me.</i>

701
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:57,189
<i>Still, now, the fact
it's come together, now,
that's a good thing, no?</i>

702
00:36:57,265 --> 00:37:00,496
<i>Mr. President, it's fantastic.</i>

703
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:02,866
<i>Frost is just not in
your intellectual class, sir.</i>

704
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:06,396
<i>You're gonna be
able to dictate terms,
rebuild your reputation.</i>

705
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:11,411
If this went well,
if enough people saw it,
revised their opinion,

706
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,744
<i>you could move back East
way, way earlier
than we expected.</i>

707
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,680
<i>You think?
I'm certain.</i>

708
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:24,284
<i>It would be so good
to go back to where
the action is.</i>

709
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:25,655
You know?

710
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:29,253
<i>The hunger in my belly
is still there, Jack.</i>

711
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:35,227
I guess it all boils down
to Watergate, huh?

712
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:37,965
<i>Well, that's nothing
to worry about, sir.</i>

713
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,769
<i>It's not as if
there's gonna be
any revelations.</i>

714
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,571
<i>That stuff's been combed over
a million times.</i>

715
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:45,942
<i>No one has pinned
anything on you.</i>

716
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,481
<i>Yeah, still,
it's been a while</i>

717
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,073
<i>since I spoke about it
on the record.</i>

718
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:51,914
<i>I'm gonna start
doing my homework.</i>

719
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:54,751
Hey, you know what would
be an interesting
thing to find out?

720
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:55,915
<i>What his strategy is.</i>

721
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,048
<i>Now, where's he staying?</i>

722
00:37:57,124 --> 00:37:58,648
<i>I believe The Beverly Hilton.</i>

723
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:00,250
<i>The Beverly Hilton, you say.</i>

724
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:02,763
Well, I got
the numbers someplace

725
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:05,231
<i>of some fellows
that we could send in.</i>

726
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,894
<i>Cubans with CIA training.</i>

727
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,313
<i>Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.</i>

728
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:21,214
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

729
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,078
<i>RESTON: A week later,
we said goodbye
to our families,</i>

730
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:30,249
<i>we hopped on a plane,
and we moved into
The Beverly Hilton.</i>

731
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:32,316
<i>And that's where we
started to dig into
our research</i>

732
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,919
<i>and prepare
for the interviews.</i>

733
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,091
Yeah, as it happens, we took

734
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:39,326
<i>the whole question
of security very seriously.</i>

735
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:45,104
<i>BIRT: And from day one,
we kept all our files
in a locked safe.</i>

736
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:52,109
Who was the guy
that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?

737
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,772
<i>BIRT: Haldeman.
RESTON: Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.</i>

738
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:56,340
<i>I always get
the Germans mixed up.</i>

<i>Excuse me.</i>

00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,451
<i>I want to put
a handkerchief here,
if I may.</i>

1042

Is that out of shot?

<i>That's fine, Mr. President.</i>

1044
00:52:52,264 --> 00:52:54,528
Contractually,
I think that we made

1045
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,900
an agreement that
after each question

1046
00:52:57,971 --> 00:53:00,531
<i>I might dab my upper lip
before answering it.</i>

1047
00:53:00,607 --> 00:53:03,575
<i>Which you won't show,
you know,
when you cut it together.</i>

1048
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:07,134
<i>You're probably aware
of my history
with perspiration.</i>

1049
00:53:07,212 --> 00:53:10,477
<i>If you're
referring to your TV debate
with Jack Kennedy in 1960.</i>

1050
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:15,317
<i>They say that
moisture on my upper lip
cost me the presidency.</i>

1051
00:53:15,388 --> 00:53:19,518
<i>People who heard
it on the radio,
well, they thought I'd won.</i>

1052
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:22,083
But television
and the close-up,

1053
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:24,629
<i>they create their
own sets of meanings.</i>

1054
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:27,893
So now they insist
I bring a handkerchief

1055
00:53:27,966 --> 00:53:30,093
<i>and that I have
my eyebrows trimmed.</i>

<i>Mr. President. Now,
we're going to be
covering a lot of subjects</i>

1078
00:54:41,007 --> 00:54:44,408
in a great deal of detail
over the course
of these interviews,

1079
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:48,380
<i>but I'd like to
begin completely
out of context</i>

1080
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:50,076
by asking you
one question,

1081
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,085
more than any other,
almost every American

1082
00:54:53,153 --> 00:54:56,315
<i>and people all over
the world want me to ask.</i>

1083
00:54:58,424 --> 00:55:00,289
<i>Why didn't you
burn the tapes?</i>

1084
00:55:03,496 --> 00:55:05,327
Son of a bitch!

1085
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:14,096
<i>Well, Mr. Frost,
I'm surprised
by your question</i>

1086
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:19,278
since we have an agreement,
a contractual agreement,
I believe,

1087
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:23,578
<i>that we would cover Watergate
in our last taping session.</i>

1088
00:55:32,893 --> 00:55:37,388
But if your viewers
really do have
a major concern,

1089
00:55:37,465 --> 00:55:42,492
<i>then perhaps I should
briefly respond to it now.</i>

1090
00:55:42,569 --> 00:55:45,697
What probably very
few people realize

1091
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:48,003
is that the taping system
in the White House

1092
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:51,340
was set up
by my predecessor,
President Johnson,

1093
00:55:51,412 --> 00:55:55,542
partly to avoid
the necessity of having
a secretary in every meeting,

1094
00:55:55,616 --> 00:55:58,142
and partly
to ensure there was

1095
00:55:58,219 --> 00:56:00,710
a record kept of
every verbal agreement,

1096
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:03,757
<i>no matter how
off the cuff or casual.</i>

1097
00:56:04,425 --> 00:56:07,019
Now, initially, on coming
into the White House,

1098
00:56:07,094 --> 00:56:09,927
<i>I insisted on
dismantling the system.</i>

1099
00:56:09,997 --> 00:56:13,296
<i>I hadn't liked
the idea at all,
but the former President,</i>

1100
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:15,631
President Johnson,
had repeatedly said

1101
00:56:15,703 --> 00:56:18,968
how crazy it would be
to remove the system,

1102
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:20,631
<i>which he felt
was the best way...</i>

1103
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,973
<i>BRENNAN: Well, in boxing,
you know, there's always
that first moment,</i>

1104
00:56:23,044 --> 00:56:25,172
<i>and you see it in
the challenger's face.</i>

1105
00:56:25,247 --> 00:56:27,373
<i>It's that moment
that he feels</i>

1106
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:29,781
<i>the impact from
the champ's first jab.</i>

1107
00:56:30,118 --> 00:56:33,884
<i>It's kind of
a sickening moment,
when he realizes that</i>

1108
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:37,254
all those months
of pep talks and the hype,

1109
00:56:37,325 --> 00:56:40,488
<i>the psyching yourself up,
had been delusional all along.</i>

1110
00:56:40,562 --> 00:56:42,530
<i>You could see it
in Frost's face.</i>

1111
00:56:42,597 --> 00:56:44,792
<i>If he didn't know
the caliber of the man</i>

1112
00:56:44,866 --> 00:56:46,994
that he was up against
before the interview started,

1113
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:49,559
<i>he certainly knew
it halfway through
the President's first answer.</i>

1114
00:56:49,637 --> 00:56:52,504
NIXON: You see,
since the best advice is

1115
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:56,169
almost always
of the confidential variety,

1116
00:56:56,244 --> 00:56:58,405
now the tapes have
been made public,

1117
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,971
people are unlikely
ever to feel comfortable

1118
00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:03,609
<i>speaking in confidence
at the White House.</i>

1119
00:57:03,685 --> 00:57:07,519
<i>They're less likely
to offer that advice.
So in the end,</i>

1120
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:09,820
<i>it's the whole
political system and,</i>

1121
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:12,826
<i>by implication, it's
the country that suffers.</i>

1122
00:57:12,894 --> 00:57:14,919
<i>So much for
our "ballsy" opening.</i>

1123
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:20,893
<i>So when did you
actually decide...</i>

1124
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:23,904
At what moment did you know
you were going to resign?

1125
00:57:23,972 --> 00:57:25,940
<i>That's good. That's good.</i>

1126
00:57:27,142 --> 00:57:31,238
<i>I remember exactly.
It was July 23.</i>

1127
00:57:31,312 --> 00:57:34,146
After it was clear
the Southern Democrats

1128
00:57:34,216 --> 00:57:35,706
that were still against
impeachment had

1129
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,845
<i>had the screws put on them
by the Speaker of the House.</i>

1130
00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:46,288
<i>That night I said to
Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."</i>

1131
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:48,287
And, of course,
you know, being Al,

1132
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,922
<i>he tried to
talk me out of it.</i>

1133
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,763
<i>And Vice President Ford,
I mean, let's not forget</i>

1134
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:56,430
he had the most
to gain personally
from my stepping down,

1135
00:57:56,505 --> 00:57:58,336
he was still
absolutely convinced that

1136
00:57:58,407 --> 00:58:00,204
we were gonna win
the impeachment vote,

1137
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,039
<i>and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.</i>

1138
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,100
<i>We have to move this along.</i>

1139
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,874
<i>This is desperate, John.
Do something.</i>

1140
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:07,347
Twenty-three minutes
on one question?

You've got to
stop him rambling.</i>

1152
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,133
<i>It's all right.
These are just
introductory exchanges.</i>

1153

<i>But this session
only lasts two hours.</i>

and we're wasting
valuable material, okay?</i>

00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:37,775
The moment that he made
the decision to resign,

1156
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,144
<i>we should be scoring
points with that stuff.</i>

1157
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:40,375
Want me to switch to Vietnam?

1158
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:41,938
<i>No. No.
We've got to
get something</i>

1159
00:58:42,016 --> 00:58:43,747
<i>out of that
resignation night.
All right?</i>

1160
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,381
<i>That was Nixon at
his lowest point,
a total wreck. On his knees?</i>

<i>Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail
him with that stuff.</i>

1162
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,391
Listen, was that okay?

1163
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:52,758
<i>Perfect, sir.</i>

1164
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,491
<i>It didn't sound too
arrogant or self-serving?</i>

1165
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:59,057
<i>Not at all.
You sounded controlled,
even-handed, statesmanlike.</i>

1166
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,329
<i>Good.</i>

1167
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,563
<i>Now continue
exactly the same way.</i>

back on camera three
in four, three, two and...</i>

1173

Reading the account
of those extraordinary
final days,

1174
00:59:27,696 --> 00:59:30,164
it seems your most
emotional moment came

<i>in that
heart-to-heart you had
with Henry Kissinger.</i>

1176
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:37,266
Was that perhaps
the most emotional moment
of your career?

<i>RESTON: Good, good.
NIXON: Yes.</i>

1178
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:45,378
<i>I would say it was
about as emotional
a moment as I've ever had.</i>

1179

it's hard to say</i>

emotional moment,

<i>For God's sake.</i>

1184

my eldest daughter
Tricia down the aisle.</i>

1185
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:06,530
And the day during
the impeachment hearings

1186
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:10,233
<i>when Julie,
that's my youngest,
she came into my office,</i>

1187
01:00:10,308 --> 01:00:14,801

she kissed me.
She cried, you know?</i>

1188
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:17,780
<i>And she so seldom cries.</i>

1189
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:20,314
<i>She said, "Daddy, you're
the finest man I know."</i>

1190
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,375
<i>"Daddy, you're

So Kissinger and I were
in the Lincoln Sitting Room,

1195
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,195
and together we began
to reminisce

1196
01:00:42,273 --> 01:00:46,107
<i>about some of
the great decisions that
we'd participated in.</i>

1197
01:00:46,177 --> 01:00:49,374

the Soviet Union,

1198
01:00:49,447 --> 01:00:51,972
<i>the peace settlement
in Vietnam.</i>

1199
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:56,076
<i>Now, let me
tell you something that
I never told anybody.</i>

1200
01:00:56,153 --> 01:01:00,590
<i>Whenever I have had
a really tough
decision to make...</i>

1201
01:01:00,925 --> 01:01:03,689
<i>Now, we were in
the Lincoln Sitting Room
at that time.</i>

1202
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:07,459
<i>I have come into this room
for the purpose of praying.</i>

1203
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,368
<i>"Now, Henry,
I'm a Quaker.

1204

<i>"Neither of us is
particularly orthodox,</i>

1205
01:01:14,473 --> 01:01:17,499
<i>"but I'd like to think
that each of us
in our own way</i>

1206
01:01:17,576 --> 01:01:20,567
<i>"has a deep
religious sensitivity.</i>

1207
01:01:20,645 --> 01:01:25,742
<i>"So if you don't mind,
could we just have a moment
of silent prayer?"</i>

1208
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:30,049
<i>So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front
of that table where</i>

1209
01:01:30,122 --> 01:01:34,286
<i>Lincoln signed
the Emancipation
Proclamation.</i>

1210
01:01:34,359 --> 01:01:37,795
<i>And then after a few moments,
we both got up again,
and Henry says...</i>

1211
01:01:37,896 --> 01:01:39,454
<i>Is there... I'm sorry.</i>

1212
01:01:39,598 --> 01:01:40,758
Is there a problem?

1213
01:01:40,832 --> 01:01:41,856

1218
01:01:52,477 --> 01:01:54,968
<i>You know,

to enjoy that.</i>

1219

So why did you do it?

1352
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:32,906
Well, first of all,

1353
01:08:32,982 --> 01:08:39,410
as a result of
our incursion into Cambodia,
we picked up 22,000 rifles,

01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:43,983
<i>15 million rounds

<i>right onto
American soldiers.</i>

1358
01:08:51,668 --> 01:08:54,932
But one of
the principal justifications
you gave for the incursion

1359
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:56,665
was the supposed
existence of

1360

<i>the "headquarters of
the entire Communist military

Now, looking back
on your final year
in office,

1668
01:31:59,739 --> 01:32:01,969
do you feel you ever
obstructed justice

1669
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:05,374
or were part of
a conspiracy to cover up
or obstruct justice?

1670
01:32:05,445 --> 01:32:06,537
<i>No.</i>

1671
01:32:07,515 --> 01:32:12,350
<i>And I'm interested
that you used the term
"obstruction of justice."</i>

1672
01:32:12,419 --> 01:32:14,512
Now, you perhaps have not

<i>with regard to
the obstruction

1675
01:32:19,459 --> 01:32:26,092
<i>You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it
doesn't just require an act.</i>

1676
01:32:26,165 --> 01:32:29,760
<i>It requires a specific
corrupt motive.</i>

1677
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:33,170
<i>And in this case,
I didn't have
a corrupt motive.</i>

1678
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,767
<i>What I was doing
was in the interests
of political containment.</i>

1679
01:32:36,844 --> 01:32:39,039
Be that as it may,
the direct consequences

1680

would have been

<i>would have escaped

01:32:44,484 --> 01:32:47,817
Now, how can that
not be a cover-up or
obstruction of justice?

1684
01:32:47,887 --> 01:32:49,650
<i>Well, I think
the record shows,
Mr. Frost,</i>

1685
01:32:49,722 --> 01:32:52,919
that far from
obstructing justice,

1686
01:32:52,992 --> 01:32:55,518
<i>I was actively
facilitating it.</i>

1687

"Pat, you go right ahead

1689
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:05,800
<i>That's hardly
what you'd call
obstructing justice.</i>

1690
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:09,001
Well, that may be,
but for two weeks
prior to July 6,

1691
01:33:09,076 --> 01:33:10,566

<i>trying to contain or block

1694
01:33:13,914 --> 01:33:15,711
<i>No, no.

is obstruction of justice,</i>

1695

<i>whether it's for
a minute or five minutes,</i>

1696
01:33:17,751 --> 01:33:19,777
<i>and it's no defense
to say that your plan failed.</i>

1697
01:33:19,854 --> 01:33:22,618
<i>I mean, if I try to
rob a bank and fail,
that's no defense.</i>

1698
01:33:22,691 --> 01:33:24,158
<i>I still tried
to rob the bank.</i>

of any kind that I was...</i>

Well, the reason
there is no evidence

1702
01:33:30,965 --> 01:33:32,626
is because

1706
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:42,199
And Bob Haldeman

<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1713
01:34:00,661 --> 01:34:02,595
<i>It hasn't been
published, you say?</i>

1714
01:34:02,663 --> 01:34:05,758
No, but one
of my researchers
found it in Washington

1715
01:34:06,401 --> 01:34:09,495
<i>where it's available
to anyone who consults
the records.</i>

1716
01:34:09,571 --> 01:34:14,234
<i>Well, I just wondered,
you know, if we'd seen it.</i>

1717
01:34:14,308 --> 01:34:15,775
<i>More than seen it,
Mr. President.</i>

1718
01:34:15,843 --> 01:34:17,505
<i>You spoke the actual words.</i>

1719
01:34:17,579 --> 01:34:21,845

you first learned of
the break-in on June 23.</i>

1720
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:22,974
<i>Yeah.</i>

1721
01:34:23,051 --> 01:34:26,680
But this transcript of a tape
made three days earlier

1722
01:34:26,755 --> 01:34:29,224
<i>clearly shows that
to be a falsehood.</i>

1723
01:34:29,825 --> 01:34:35,319
<i>Now, in it you say
to Colson, "This whole

1724
01:34:36,398 --> 01:34:41,893
<i>"unless one of the seven

<i>"That's the problem."</i>

1754
01:35:55,177 --> 01:35:57,509
I have participated
in all these interviews

1755
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,377
<i>without a single note
in front of me.</i>

1756
01:35:59,448 --> 01:36:00,938
<i>Well, it is your life,
Mr. President.</i>

1757
01:36:01,016 --> 01:36:02,142

about any of this
until March 21.</i>

1759
01:36:05,187 --> 01:36:08,748
But in February,
your personal lawyer
came to Washington

1760
01:36:08,824 --> 01:36:11,884
to start the raising
of $219,000

<i>of hush money to be
paid to the burglars.</i>

1762

expect us to believe

1763
01:36:17,032 --> 01:36:18,624
that you had
no knowledge of that?

1764
01:36:18,701 --> 01:36:22,000
<i>None. I believed
the money was for
humanitarian purposes.</i>

<i>To help
disadvantaged people
with their defenses.</i>

1766

are delivered, is it?</i>

1769
01:36:33,115 --> 01:36:35,641
<i>Look,
I have made statements
to this effect before.</i>

1770
01:36:35,719 --> 01:36:37,914
<i>All that was Haldeman
and Ehrlichman's business.</i>

Okay, fine. Fine!</i>

1772
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:41,487
<i>You made a conclusion there.</i>

1773
01:36:41,558 --> 01:36:43,150
<i>I stated my view,
now let's move on.</i>

were the ones
really responsible,

1778
01:36:48,365 --> 01:36:51,163

found out about it,

1779

call the police
and have them arrested?</i>

a cover-up of another kind?</i>

<i>Yeah, maybe I should
have done that.
Maybe I should have.</i>

1782
01:36:57,207 --> 01:36:58,970
Just called the feds
into my office

1783
01:36:59,042 --> 01:37:01,169

they were just kids.</i>

1789
01:37:11,154 --> 01:37:12,450
Yeah, but you know,
politically,

1790
01:37:12,521 --> 01:37:15,423
the pressure on me
to let them go,
that became overwhelming!

1791
01:37:15,492 --> 01:37:18,325
<i>So I did it.
I cut off one arm,</i>

1792
