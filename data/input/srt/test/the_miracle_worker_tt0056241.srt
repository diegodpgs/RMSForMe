1
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,219
She'll live.

2
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,621
I can tell you now, I thought she wouldn't.

3
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:33,710
I've brought up two of them.
This is my wife's first.

4
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:36,609
She isn't battle-scarred yet.

5
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,220
Doctor?

6
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:41,390
Will my girl be all right?

7
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:48,109
By morning she'll be knockin' down
Captain Keller's fences again.

8
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:52,025
Is there nothing we should do?

9
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,938
Put up stronger fencin'. Hm?

10
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:59,400
Just let her get well.
She knows how better than we do.

11
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:04,236
These things come and go in infants.
Never know why.

12
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:07,042
Call it acute congestion
of the stomach and brain.

13
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,206
I'll see you to your buggy, Doctor.

14
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,375
Main thing is the fever's gone.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,921
I never saw a baby with more vitality.
That's the truth.

16
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,302
(baby cries)

17
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:27,599
Hush...

18
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:29,685
Don't you cry now.

19
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:33,188
You've been trouble enough.

20
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:38,862
"Call it acute congestion" indeed!

21
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:45,269
I don't see what's so cute about
a congestion just cos it's yours.

22
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:51,701
We'll have your father
run an editorial in his paper.

23
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:54,379
"The wonders of modern medicine."

24
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:59,008
They don't know what they're curing
even when they cure it.

25
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:02,219
Men! Men and their battle scars.

26
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:06,257
We women have...

27
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:12,645
Helen?

28
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:17,024
(clicks fingers)

29
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:23,322
Helen!

30
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,530
Cap'n!

31
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:29,332
(screaming)

32
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:32,328
Cap'n! Will you come?

33
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,794
- Katie! What is it? What's happened?
- (screaming)

34
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,207
- Katie! What is it? What's wrong?
- Look! She can't see.

35
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:44,629
Look at her eyes. She can't see.

36
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:45,926
Helen!

37
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:49,307
Or hear.
When I screamed she didn't blink.

38
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,641
- Not an eyelash!
- Helen!

39
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:56,189
- She can't hear you!
- Helen!

40
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:59,025
Helen!

41
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,891
I told you to let her be.

42
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,916
(grunts)

43
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:08,252
Arthur? Arthur, something
ought to be done for that child.

44
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:10,673
A refreshin' suggestion. What?

45
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,887
Why, this very famous
Perkins School in Boston.

46
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:16,471
They're just supposed to do wonders.

47
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,978
She's been to specialists. They couldn't
help her in Baltimore or Washington.

48
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:23,858
I think the Cap'n will write
to the Perkins School soon.

49
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,620
Katie, how many times
can you break your heart?

50
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:31,232
Any number of times, as long as there's
the least chance for her to see or hear.

51
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:34,036
- What, child?
- There isn't! I must finish here.

52
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:37,908
With your permission, Cap'n, I would
like to write to the Perkins School.

53
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,497
I said no, Kate.

54
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:42,079
(older woman)
Writing does no harm, Arthur.

55
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,459
- A little bitty letter to see if they can help.
- They can't.

56
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,754
(Kate) We won't know that to be a fact
till after you write.

57
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:50,539
They can't.

58
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,716
Katie...

59
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:57,838
- I might as well work in a hen yard.
- (baby cries)

60
00:06:57,975 --> 00:07:00,762
- You really ought to put her away, Father.
- What?

61
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:04,394
- Some asylum. It's the kindest thing.
- She is your sister, James.

62
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,858
Half-sister and half... mentally defective.

63
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:11,437
She can't keep herself clean.
It's not pleasant to see her about.

64
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,653
Do you dare complain
of what you can see?

65
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:19,783
This discussion's at an end. The house
is at sixes and sevens over the child.

66
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:22,487
I want some peace here. I don't care how.

67
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,125
But we won't have it by rushin' about
the country to every new quack.

68
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:28,923
- I'm as sensible to this affliction as...
- Helen!

69
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,088
My buttons.

70
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:51,149
Eyes.

71
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:53,949
She wants the doll to have eyes.

72
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:09,004
My goodness me. I'm not decent.

73
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,875
She doesn't know better, Aunt Ev.
I'll sew 'em on again.

74
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,509
It's worth a couple of buttons, Kate. Look.

75
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:25,806
This child has more sense
than all these men Kellers,

76
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,429
if there's ever a way
to reach that mind of hers.

77
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,109
- Helen!
- (baby cries)

78
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:34,730
Helen! You're not to do such things.
How can I make you understand?

79
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,407
Katie!

80
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,197
How can I get it
into your head, my darling?

81
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:42,735
Katie, she must be taught
some discipline.

82
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:45,279
Discipline an afflicted child?
Is it her fault?

83
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,451
I didn't say it was.

84
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,120
How can I teach her?
Beat her till she's black and blue?

85
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:54,340
It's not safe. There must be
some way of confinin' her.

86
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,086
In a cage? She's a growin' child.
She has to use her limbs.

87
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:00,926
Answer me one thing.
Is it fair to the baby?

88
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:04,460
Are you willing to put her away?

89
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:07,100
Now what?

90
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,638
She wants to talk like...

91
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,940
be like you and me.

92
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,908
Every day she slips further away.

93
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:33,287
I don't know how to call her back.

94
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:37,124
I do have a mind
to write to Boston myself.

95
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:43,049
If that school can't help her,
maybe they'll send somebody who can.

96
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:47,182
I'll write to Perkins, Katie.

97
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,355
(makes guttural sound)

98
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,602
Train to New York!

99
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,027
And south!

100
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:01,482
It will no doubt be difficult for you there.

101
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:04,653
(conductor) All aboard!

102
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,609
This is my last time to counsel you, Annie.

103
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:12,035
You do lack some -
and by some I mean all - what?

104
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:15,621
Tact. All talent to bend to others.

105
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:18,331
What has saved you
more than once at Perkins

106
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:21,302
is that there was nowhere to expel you to.

107
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,460
- Your eyes hurt?
- My ears, Mr Anagnos.

108
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:28,070
Nowhere but to that dreadful place
where you grew up learning to be saucy!

109
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:31,225
Annie, I know how unhappy
it was for you there,

110
00:10:31,355 --> 00:10:34,938
but that battle is dead and done with.
Why not let it stay buried?

111
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,773
- I think God must owe me a resurrection.
- What?

112
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,772
- He keeps digging up that battle.
- That is not a proper thing to say.

113
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:47,115
Be humble. You'll need their affection
working with this child.

114
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,292
A gift, with our affection.

115
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,793
Dear Mr Anagnos.

116
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,966
Well... What should I say?

117
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:14,100
I'm an ignorant, opinionated girl,
and everything I am I owe to you?

118
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,722
That is only half-true, Annie.

119
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,402
Which half?

120
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,441
Good luck.

121
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,408
Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye.

122
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,620
I won't give them any trouble. I'll be
so ladylike they won't notice I've come!

123
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,309
- (child) Where are we going, Annie?
- Jimmy...

124
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:04,837
- Where are we going?
- I said I'm taking care of you.

125
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:05,964
Where are we going?

126
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:08,383
(man) Annie Sullivan, aged nine,
virtually blind.

127
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:12,842
James Sullivan, aged seven.
What's the matter with your leg, sonny?

128
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:15,727
(Annie) It's his hip, mister.
He was born that way.

129
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:20,018
(man) Can't he walk without a crutch? Girl
to the women's ward, boy to the men's.

130
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,317
Annie! Annie, don't let them take me!

131
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:24,903
Annie! Annie...

132
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:27,068
(train whistle)

133
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,839
Tuscumbia!

134
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:49,841
Tuscumbia!

135
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:54,966
- Miss Sullivan?
- Here.

136
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:59,312
At last. I thought the trains must be
backing up every time I dozed off.

137
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,602
- I'm James Keller.
- James? I had a brother Jimmy.

138
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:06,820
- Are you Helen's?
- I'm only half her brother.

139
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:10,446
- You're to be her governess?
- Well, try.

140
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,442
You look like half a governess.

141
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,745
- You have a trunk, Miss Sullivan?
- Yes.

142
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,799
Mrs Keller.

143
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,740
We've met every train for two days.

144
00:14:57,288 --> 00:15:00,158
You didn't bring Helen.
I was hoping you would.

145
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,331
No, she's home.

146
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:08,560
- You live far from town, Mrs Keller?
- Only a mile.

147
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,759
Well, I suppose I could wait
one more mile.

148
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:16,370
But don't be surprised
if I get out and push the horse.

149
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:32,145
- Welcome to lvy Green, Miss Sullivan.
- My husband, Miss Annie. Cap'n Keller.

150
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:34,210
- Captain, how do you do?
- Pleasure to see you.

151
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,701
- I trust you had an agreeable journey.
- Oh, I had several.

152
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:41,115
- Where do you want the trunk?
- Where Miss Sullivan can get at it.

153
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:43,371
- Yes. Where's Helen?
- And the suitcase.

154
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,787
I'll take that. I've got something
for Helen. When do I see her?

155
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:50,409
(Kate) There. There's Helen.

156
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,467
- (Captain) Katie...
- Sh.

157
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:26,629
- She's very rough, Katie.
- I like her, Cap'n.

158
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:29,037
How old is she?

159
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,919
Well, she's not in her teens, you know.

160
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:36,753
Why does she wear those glasses? I like
to see a person's eyes when I talk to 'em.

161
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:40,251
- For the sun. She was blind.
- Blind?

162
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:44,964
She had nine operations on her eyes.
One just before she left.

163
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:49,144
Blind? Good heavens! They expect
one blind child to teach another?

164
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,141
How long did she teach there?

165
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:54,313
She was a pupil.

166
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:57,313
This is her first position?

167
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:59,484
She was valedictorian.

168
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,903
A houseful of grown-ups
can't cope with Helen.

169
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,650
How can a half-blind Yankee
schoolgirl manage?

170
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:06,950
Great improvement.
Now we have two of them.

171
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,750
- You be quiet.
- I was agreeing with you.

172
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,329
You talk too much.

173
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:17,869
- Nothing I say is right.
- Why say anything?

174
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,730
All the trouble I went to
and that's how I look?

175
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,130
Oh, no, not the drawers.

176
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:06,301
(doll makes sound)

177
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,631
All right, Miss O'Sullivan, let's begin.

178
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:48,885
With doll.

179
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:51,055
D...

180
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,730
O...

181
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:08,220
L...

182
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:14,327
L.

183
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:19,751
Doll.

184
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,919
You spell pretty well.

185
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:31,257
Finding out if she's ticklish? She is.

186
00:21:33,852 --> 00:21:36,769
- What is it, a game?
- An alphabet.

187
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,610
Alphabet?

188
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,688
For the deaf.

189
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:15,924
- How bright she is.
- You think she knows what she's doing?

190
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,481
She's a monkey. She imitates everything.

191
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:35,819
Yes, she's a bright little monkey, all right.

192
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,832
She wants her doll back.

193
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,255
- When she spells it.
- She doesn't know the thing has a name.

194
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,051
Of course not. Who expects her to now?
All I want is her fingers to learn the letters.

195
00:22:58,185 --> 00:23:00,079
Won't mean anything to her.

196
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:03,643
She doesn't like that alphabet.
You invent it yourself?

197
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:09,180
Spanish monks under a vow of silence -
which I wish you'd take.

198
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:19,451
Yes... Yes!

199
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,338
C...

200
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,872
A...

201
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:31,463
K...

202
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,634
E.

203
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:40,846
Yes.

204
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:45,392
You do as my fingers do.
Never mind what it means.

205
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:54,404
Now...

206
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:00,368
D...

207
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,329
O...

208
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:09,900
L...

209
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,400
L.

210
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:20,181
Think it over.

211
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:52,255
L.

212
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:59,299
Imitate now. Understand later.
End of the first lesson.

213
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:01,051
Ow!

214
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:06,011
Oh, you little wretch.
Nobody's taught you any manners.

215
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,150
Helen? Helen!

216
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:18,023
Helen! Helen, let me out...

217
00:25:36,428 --> 00:25:39,214
Don't worry, they'll find you.
You're not lost.

218
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:41,386
Only out of place.

219
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:49,098
And toothless!

220
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,393
- Where's Miss Sullivan?
- Locked in her room.

221
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:55,988
Locked in her...?

222
00:25:56,114 --> 00:26:00,250
- Helen locked her in and took the key.
- And you sit here and say nothing?

223
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:03,372
Everyone's been telling me
not to say anything.

224
00:26:03,497 --> 00:26:07,625
- Viney, look out front for Helen.
- She's out by the pump!

225
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,829
I'll look.

226
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,246
- Miss Sullivan.
- Yes, Captain Keller.

227
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:14,622
Is there no key on your side?

228
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:17,627
If there were a key, I wouldn't be in here.
Helen took it.

229
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,919
The only thing on my side is me.

230
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:24,432
Not in the house ten minutes.
I don't see how you managed it.

231
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,800
And even I'm not on my side.

232
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:29,308
- Viney!
- Yes, sir, Captain Keller?

233
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:32,226
Put that meat back in the oven!

234
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:37,488
- She has no key.
- Nonsense. You searched in her pockets?

235
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:40,733
- Yes. She doesn't have it.
- Katie, she must have the key.

236
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:44,986
- Take that ladder back!
- Certainly.

237
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:46,948
- She could have hidden it.
- Where?

238
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:49,288
Anywhere. Under a stone...

239
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:52,750
I can't plough up the entire grounds
to find a missin' key.

240
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,954
Jimmy! Bring me a ladder!

241
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:56,916
Certainly.

242
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:00,256
- (baby crying)
- What's the baby doing up?

243
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:03,173
Captain woke her, Miss Kate.
All that hollerin'.

244
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:05,215
(whistles)

245
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,390
Get back to your work!

246
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:16,726
- Miss Sullivan!
- Yes, Captain Keller?

247
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:19,816
- Come onto the roof.
- You have a ladder. How thoughtful.

248
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:21,904
Come down, Miss Sullivan.

249
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:24,026
- I don't see how I can.
- I'll carry you.

250
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:28,028
- It's very chivalrous, but...
- Miss Sullivan, follow instructions.

251
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:30,951
I will not have you also
tumblin' out of our windows.

252
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:35,829
I hope this is not what we may expect in
simplifyin' the work of looking after Helen.

253
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:39,213
Captain Keller, I'm able to go down
a ladder under my own steam.

254
00:27:39,342 --> 00:27:41,599
Miss Sullivan, I doubt it.

255
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:43,759
Simply hold onto my neck.

256
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:49,298
My neck, Miss Sullivan!

257
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:53,064
- I'm sorry to inconvenience you.
- No inconvenience.

258
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,934
Other than taking that door down and
replacing the lock, if we can't find the key.

259
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:00,108
- I'll look everywhere.
- Thank you.

260
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:03,442
Do not look in any rooms
that can be locked.

261
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,200
There!

262
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:11,202
Go, go! What are you looking at?
Nothing for you to look at.

263
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,494
- Now...
- (baby cries)

264
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:16,125
Would it be possible for us
to have dinner like other people?

265
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,000
- Miss Sullivan!
- Viney, I'll put the baby to sleep.

266
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,423
Oh... Might as well leave the l-a-d-d-e-r.

267
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:08,609
You devil.

268
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:22,856
Oh, you think I'm so easily gotten rid of?

269
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:25,359
You've got a thing or two to learn first.

270
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,407
I've got nothing else to do,

271
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:32,829
- and nowhere to go.
- (Captain) Miss Sullivan!

272
00:29:37,461 --> 00:29:41,672
Discipline her

273
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:45,712
without breaking...

274
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,460
(gasps)

275
00:30:00,483 --> 00:30:02,730
Ink.

276
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:13,825
Ink.

277
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:15,994
It has a name.

278
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,630
Down, under, up.
And be careful of the needle.

279
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:52,659
Right. You keep out of the ink and
perhaps I can keep out of the soup.

280
00:30:55,705 --> 00:30:57,946
(gasps)

281
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:03,160
All right, all right. Let's try temperance.

282
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:13,090
Bad...

283
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:15,262
girl.

284
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:53,053
Good...

285
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,219
girl.

286
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:20,661
Yes.

287
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:38,846
Very good girl.

288
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:21,257
- (Kate) What are you saying to her?
- I was just making conversation.

289
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:24,400
Saying it was a sewing card.

290
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:27,102
Does that mean that to her?

291
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:32,605
Oh, no. She won't know what spelling is
till she knows what a word is.

292
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:38,277
The Cap'n says it's like
spellin' to a fence post.

293
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:41,153
Does he, now?

294
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:43,030
- Is it?
- No.

295
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:46,035
It's how I watch you talk to the baby.

296
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,290
- The baby?
- Any baby.

297
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,916
It's gibberish. Grown-up gibberish.
Baby-talk gibberish.

298
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:56,589
Do they understand
one word of it to start?

299
00:33:56,677 --> 00:34:01,423
Somehow they begin to if they hear it.
I'm letting Helen hear it.

300
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,349
Other children are not... impaired.

301
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:11,853
Oh, there's nothing impaired in that head.
It works like a mousetrap.

302
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:16,864
And... when will she learn?

303
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:21,865
Maybe after a million words.

304
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:29,331
Perhaps you'd like to read Dr Howe
on the question of words.

305
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:45,844
I should like also
to learn those... letters, Miss Annie.

306
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:49,766
I'll teach them to you tomorrow morning.

307
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:52,981
That makes only half a million each.

308
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:56,817
- It's her bedtime.
- Yes.

309
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,648
Ow!

310
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:02,947
I'm sorry.

311
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:05,117
(makes guttural sounds)

312
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:14,704
Why does she get a reward
for stabbing me?

313
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,920
There are so many times
she simply cannot be compelled.

314
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:22,844
Yes.

315
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:25,677
I'm the same way myself.

316
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:30,143
Good night.

317
00:36:00,302 --> 00:36:03,052
(James) Shouldn't we give
the devil his due, Father?

318
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:07,474
We lost the South two years earlier
when he outthought us behind Vicksburg.

319
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:09,724
Outthought is a peculiar word
for a butcher.

320
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:12,224
- Harness-maker, wasn't he?
- I said butcher.

321
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:16,934
His strength as a soldier was numbers.
He led them to slaughter like sheep.

322
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:20,936
- But even if he was a butcher...
- And a drunk, half the war.

323
00:36:21,072 --> 00:36:23,907
Agreed, Father.
If his own people said he was...

324
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:26,905
What is it you find to admire
in such a man, Jimmy?

325
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:31,248
- The drunkenness or the butchery?
- Neither, Father. Only that he beat us.

326
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,375
- He didn't.
- Are you saying we won the war, sir?

327
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:38,666
He didn't beat us at Vicksburg.
We lost it by stupidity vergin' on treason.

328
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:43,295
(James) We lost it because Grant was
one thing no Yankee general was before...

329
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:44,629
Drunk? I doubt it.

330
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,099
- Obstinate.
- Obstinate?

331
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,349
None of 'em compare with old Stonewall.
If he was there we'd still have Vicksburg.

332
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:54,764
(James) The butcher wouldn't give up.
He tried four ways...

333
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:57,139
(Captain) If we'd had
a Southerner in command

334
00:36:57,275 --> 00:37:02,159
instead of a half-breed Yankee traitor
like Pemberton... What's the matter?

335
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:06,909
Miss Annie, she's accustomed
to helping herself from our plates.

336
00:37:07,034 --> 00:37:10,985
- I'm not accustomed to it.
- Of course not. Viney!

337
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:14,159
- Jimmy, give her something.
- Her table manners are her best.

338
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:17,992
Let her this time. It's the only way
we get any adult conversation.

339
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,702
- I'll get another plate.
- I have one, thank you.

340
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,300
Viney! What Cap'n Keller says is only
too true. She'll persist in this till...

341
00:37:25,427 --> 00:37:30,090
- I have a plate. I intend to keep it.
- You see why they took Vicksburg?

342
00:37:30,224 --> 00:37:33,309
A plate is no matter
to struggle with a deprived child about.

343
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:36,936
- I'd sooner have a more heroic issue.
- I really must insist...

344
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:38,809
- She's hurt herself.
- She hasn't.

345
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:42,987
- Will you please let her hands go?
- You don't know her well enough...

346
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:46,315
I know a tantrum when I see one
and a badly spoiled child.

347
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:47,362
Hear, hear.

348
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:50,161
You'd have more understanding
if you had some pity.

349
00:37:50,286 --> 00:37:53,987
Pity? For this tyrant?
The whole house turns on her whims.

350
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:56,164
Is there anything she doesn't get?

351
00:37:56,293 --> 00:38:00,954
What I pity is that the sun won't rise and
set for her, and you're telling her it will.

352
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:03,626
What good will your pity do
when you're gone?

353
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:07,257
- Kate, for the love of heaven...
- I don't think it serves...

354
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:11,550
Serves you good. It's less trouble
to feel sorry than to teach her anything...

355
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:13,717
You haven't taught her anything yet.

356
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:16,177
- I'll begin now if you leave the room.
- Leave?

357
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:19,266
- Everyone, please!
- You are a paid teacher, nothing more.

358
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:23,016
I can't unteach her six years of pity
if you can't stand up to one tantrum.

359
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:25,905
Old Stonewall indeed!

360
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,233
Mrs Keller, you promised me help.
Leave me alone with her now.

361
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:31,239
Katie, come outside with me at once!

362
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:34,454
- Heaven's sakes!
- Out, please.

363
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,335
If it takes all summer, General!

364
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,414
I've a mind to ship her back to Boston,
and you can inform her so for me.

365
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,342
- I, Cap'n?
- She's a hireling.

366
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:50,137
Unless there's a complete
change of manner,

367
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:53,134
she goes back on the next train.
Will you make that clear?

368
00:38:53,266 --> 00:38:56,766
Where will you be, Cap'n,
while I am making it clear?

369
00:38:56,894 --> 00:38:58,934
At the office.

370
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:09,487
Will you? I thought what she said
was exceptionally intelligent.

371
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:13,400
- I've been sayin' it for years.
- To his face?

372
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:18,900
Or will you take it, Jimmy, as a flag?

373
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:25,378
(banging)

374
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,280
(makes guttural sounds)

375
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:31,873
(stamps feet)

376
00:45:57,983 --> 00:46:00,021
(yells)

377
00:47:32,911 --> 00:47:36,260
Good girl, Helen.

378
00:47:36,706 --> 00:47:38,829
Agh!

379
00:47:45,882 --> 00:47:47,922
(clock striking)

380
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:54,340
I don't see how you can wait here
a minute longer, Kate.

381
00:47:54,474 --> 00:47:57,427
This could go on all afternoon too.

382
00:47:58,894 --> 00:48:01,681
I'll tell the Cap'n you called.

383
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:14,110
Give me her, Miss Kate.
I'll sneak her in back to her crib.

384
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:19,402
- She never gives me a minute's worry.
- Oh, yes.

385
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:23,039
This one's the angel of the family.
No question about that.

386
00:48:33,137 --> 00:48:36,802
- What happened?
- She ate from her own plate.

387
00:48:36,932 --> 00:48:39,934
She ate with a spoon... herself.

388
00:48:40,603 --> 00:48:42,844
And she folded her napkin.

389
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:46,146
Folded her napkin?

390
00:48:46,777 --> 00:48:50,311
The room's a wreck,
but her napkin is folded.

391
00:48:51,155 --> 00:48:53,646
I'll be in my room, Mrs Keller.

392
00:48:53,782 --> 00:48:58,789
Don't be long, Miss Annie.
Dinner'll be ready right away.

393
00:49:15,806 --> 00:49:17,844
Folded her napkin...

394
00:49:20,434 --> 00:49:23,601
My Helen folded her napkin?

395
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:02,806
(clattering)

396
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:07,063
(screaming)

397
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,349
(woman) There's school.

398
00:50:09,483 --> 00:50:12,021
- There is school.
- (woman #2) There is not.

399
00:50:12,153 --> 00:50:15,190
What lies are you telling
the ignorant girl, you old loon?

400
00:50:15,322 --> 00:50:17,695
They teach blind ones worse than her.

401
00:50:17,826 --> 00:50:21,443
- To do what? See with their nose?
- To read and write.

402
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,248
How can they read and write
if they can't see?

403
00:50:24,373 --> 00:50:27,327
- (screaming)
- You crazy old Mick.

404
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,666
(banging)

405
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,255
(Jimmy) You ain't going to school, Annie?

406
00:50:36,385 --> 00:50:37,715
When I grow up.

407
00:50:37,846 --> 00:50:41,925
You ain't either, Annie. You're going
to stay here, take care of me.

408
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:43,802
I'm going to school when I grow up.

409
00:50:43,936 --> 00:50:47,579
You said we'd be together
for ever and ever and ever.

410
00:50:47,646 --> 00:50:51,858
I'm going to school when I grow up!
Now leave me be.

411
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:12,414
"Can nothing be done
to disinter this human soul?"

412
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:20,569
"The whole neighbourhood
would rush to save this woman

413
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:25,342
if she were buried alive
by the caving in of a pit,

414
00:51:25,476 --> 00:51:29,059
and labour with zeal
until she were dug out."

415
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:35,181
"Now, if there were one
who had as much patience as zeal,

416
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,360
he might awaken her..."

417
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:50,335
- (woman) They're all here.
- (woman #2) Talk to them.

418
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,619
- (woman #3) You can get out.
- Talk to them.

419
00:51:52,753 --> 00:51:55,389
(woman) All the investigators is here.

420
00:51:55,715 --> 00:51:59,630
- That's Mr Sanborn.
- He's the commissioner. Talk to him.

421
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,338
You might get out.

422
00:52:01,471 --> 00:52:03,130
Mr Sanborn?

423
00:52:03,264 --> 00:52:06,135
Mr Sanborn, I want to go to school.

424
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:18,936
"...might awaken her to a consciousness
of her immortal nature."

425
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:21,989
"The chance is small indeed,

426
00:52:22,117 --> 00:52:27,657
but with a smaller chance they would
have dug desperately for her in the pit."

427
00:52:27,789 --> 00:52:33,246
"And is the life of the soul
of less import than that of the body?"

428
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:35,347
Let alone the question of
who's to pay for the broken dishware.

429
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:38,768
From the moment she came,
she's been nothing but a burden.

430
00:53:38,902 --> 00:53:42,981
Incompetent, impertinent,
ineffectual, immodest and...

431
00:53:43,114 --> 00:53:45,619
She folded her napkin, Cap'n.

432
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:48,260
- She what?
- Not ineffectual.

433
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:51,074
Helen did fold her napkin.

434
00:53:51,206 --> 00:53:54,373
What is so extraordinary
about foldin' a napkin?

435
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,992
Well, it's more than you did, Cap'n.

436
00:53:57,128 --> 00:53:58,753
Katie...

437
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,309
Today she scuttled any chance
of gettin' along with the child.

438
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:05,884
If you can see any point in her staying,
it's more than I can.

439
00:54:06,012 --> 00:54:09,927
- What do you wish me to do?
- I want you to give her notice.

440
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:14,766
- I can't.
- Then if you won't, I must.

441
00:54:20,152 --> 00:54:21,119
(whimpering)

442
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,019
(Captain Keller shouting)

443
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:35,909
(Captain Keller shouting)

444
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:40,833
Miss Sullivan?

445
00:54:40,963 --> 00:54:43,668
Captain Keller,
I thought we should have a talk.

446
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,338
Yes, I... Well, come in.

447
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:51,675
Miss Sullivan, I have decided...
I have decided I'm not satisfied.

448
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:54,264
- In fact, I'm deeply dissatisfied.
- Excuse me.

449
00:54:54,393 --> 00:54:58,143
- Is that little house near the bridge used?
- In the huntin' season.

450
00:54:58,273 --> 00:55:02,353
- Mrs Keller...
- If you'll give me your attention.

451
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:07,778
I've made allowances because you come
from a part of the country where people...

452
00:55:07,907 --> 00:55:09,780
(clears throat)

453
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:14,452
...women, I should say, come from,
for whom allowances must be made.

454
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:17,036
I have decided nevertheless

455
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,869
to...

456
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,914
Miss Sullivan, I find it difficult
to talk through those glasses.

457
00:55:27,052 --> 00:55:31,619
Why do you wear them?
The sun's been down for an hour.

458
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,641
Any kind of light hurts my eyes.

459
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:41,097
Put them on, Miss Sullivan.

460
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:44,898
I've decided...

461
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:49,322
to give you another chance.

462
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:51,690
- To do what?
- To remain in our employ.

463
00:55:51,827 --> 00:55:54,400
But on two conditions.
I'm not used to rudeness.

464
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,159
There must be a radical
change of manner.

465
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:59,960
- Whose?
- Yours, young lady! Isn't it obvious?

466
00:56:00,085 --> 00:56:02,954
And persuade me there's
a hope of your teaching a child

467
00:56:03,088 --> 00:56:06,291
who flees from you like the plague
to anyone in this house.

468
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:08,297
- There isn't.
- What, Miss Annie?

469
00:56:08,427 --> 00:56:10,465
It's hopeless here.

470
00:56:11,449 --> 00:56:13,132
- Do I understand...
- If we agree it's hopeless...

471
00:56:13,264 --> 00:56:16,016
Miss Annie, I'm not agreed.

472
00:56:17,226 --> 00:56:19,559
She did fold her napkin.

473
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:20,844
She learns.

474
00:56:21,398 --> 00:56:24,103
She learns.

475
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:27,684
Do you know she began talking
when she was six months old?

476
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,489
She could say water.

477
00:56:30,614 --> 00:56:32,690
Well, not really.

478
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,864
Wah-wah.

479
00:56:36,204 --> 00:56:38,244
Wah-wah.

480
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:44,599
But she meant water. She knew
what it meant, and only six months old.

481
00:56:44,628 --> 00:56:48,496
I never saw a child so bright or outgoing.

482
00:56:54,306 --> 00:56:57,804
It's still in there somewhere, isn't it?

483
00:57:04,775 --> 00:57:07,775
Miss Annie, put up with her and with us.

484
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:09,942
(Captain) Us?

485
00:57:11,114 --> 00:57:13,619
Please.

486
00:57:13,657 --> 00:57:18,699
Like the lost lamb in the parable,
I love her all the more.

487
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:27,295
Mrs Keller, I don't think Helen's
worst handicap is deafness or blindness.

488
00:57:27,422 --> 00:57:31,389
I think it's your love... and pity.

489
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:35,257
All of you are so sorry for her,
you've kept her like a pet.

490
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:38,259
Why, even a dog you housebreak.

491
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:45,431
It's useless for me to try to teach her
language or anything else here.

492
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:52,179
Miss Annie, before you came
we spoke of putting her in an asylum.

493
00:57:52,697 --> 00:57:54,938
What kind of asylum?

494
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,490
For mental defectives.

495
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:07,199
I visited there. I can't tell you what I saw.

496
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:13,295
People like animals,
with rats in the halls and...

497
00:58:16,054 --> 00:58:18,213
What else are we to do if you give up?

498
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,217
Give up?

499
00:58:22,393 --> 00:58:25,726
- You said it was hopeless.
- Here.

500
00:58:25,856 --> 00:58:30,398
Give up? Why, I only today saw
what has to be done to begin.

501
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:32,983
- I want complete charge of her.
- You have that.

502
00:58:33,112 --> 00:58:37,063
No. I mean day and night.
She has to be dependent on me.

503
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:39,322
- (Kate) For what?
- Everything.

504
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:44,494
The food she eats,
the clothes she wears, fresh... air.

505
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,996
Yes, the air she breathes.

506
00:58:47,126 --> 00:58:50,827
Whatever her body needs
is a primer to teach her out of.

507
00:58:50,963 --> 00:58:55,293
The one who lets her have it should be
her teacher, not anyone who loves her.

508
00:58:55,427 --> 00:59:00,052
- But if she runs from you to us...
- Yes. That's the point.

509
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:06,353
I'll have to live with her somewhere else.

510
00:59:06,478 --> 00:59:07,807
For how long?

511
00:59:07,938 --> 00:59:10,726
Until she learns to listen to
and depend on me.

512
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:13,184
- I've packed half my things.
- Miss Sullivan...

513
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:17,170
It meets your conditions. It's the one way
I can get back in touch with Helen.

514
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:20,403
And I can't be rude to you
if you're not around.

515
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,869
What is your intention if I say no?
Pack the other half for home

516
00:59:23,996 --> 00:59:26,072
and abandon your charge to... to...

517
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:31,034
The asylum? I grew up in such an asylum.
The state almshouse.

518
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,286
Rats?

519
00:59:32,422 --> 00:59:37,329
My brother Jimmy and I used to play
with the rats because we didn't have toys.

520
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:41,302
Maybe you'd like to know what Helen
will find not on visiting days.

521
00:59:41,431 --> 00:59:44,010
One ward was full of the old women -
crippled, blind,

522
00:59:44,684 --> 00:59:47,721
most of them dying,
but there was nowhere to move them.

523
00:59:47,853 --> 00:59:50,344
That's where they put us.

524
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:54,480
There were younger ones - prostitutes
mostly, with TB and epileptic fits,

525
00:59:54,610 --> 01:00:01,112
and a couple of the kind who keep after
other girls, especially young ones.

526
01:00:01,242 --> 01:00:03,483
And some insane. Some just had the DT's.

527
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:08,163
The youngest were in another ward
to have babies. They started at 13, 14.

528
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:10,746
They'd leave,
but we played with the babies,

529
01:00:10,876 --> 01:00:14,791
though a lot had sores from diseases
you're not supposed to talk about.

530
01:00:14,922 --> 01:00:17,128
But not many of them lived.

531
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:19,831
The first year we had 80. 70 died.

532
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:23,469
Jimmy and I played in the dead-house
where they kept the bodies.

533
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,802
- Oh, my dear...
- No. It made me strong.

534
01:00:32,023 --> 01:00:36,731
But I don't think you need send
Helen there. She's strong enough.

535
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,110
Miss Annie.

536
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:44,032
Yes?

537
01:00:45,286 --> 01:00:48,371
Where would you take Helen?

538
01:00:51,001 --> 01:00:53,589
Well...

539
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:57,369
- Italy?
- What?

540
01:00:58,215 --> 01:01:02,463
Can't have everything.
How would your little house do?

541
01:01:03,972 --> 01:01:07,471
Bring Helen there after a long ride
so she won't recognise it.

542
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:11,099
You can see her every day
if she doesn't know.

543
01:01:13,648 --> 01:01:15,226
Well?

544
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:18,443
- Is that all?
- That's all.

545
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:21,739
Why, Cap'n, with your permission...

546
01:01:24,284 --> 01:01:26,489
Percy could sleep there, run errands.

547
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:28,742
We could let Percy sleep there, Cap'n.

548
01:01:28,871 --> 01:01:32,121
- And move in some old furniture.
- Cap'n, that old bedstead...

549
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,623
I've not yet consented to Percy,
or the house,

550
01:01:34,753 --> 01:01:37,458
or the proposal,
or to Miss Sullivan staying on.

551
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:39,628
When I...

552
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,010
Very well, I consent to everything.
For two weeks.

553
01:01:43,677 --> 01:01:48,635
I'll give you two weeks. It'll be a miracle
if you can get that child to tolerate you.

554
01:01:48,766 --> 01:01:52,634
Two weeks. Miss Annie, can you
accomplish anything in two weeks?

555
01:01:52,771 --> 01:01:56,050
Anything or not, two weeks
and the child comes back to us.

556
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:00,226
Make up your mind, Miss Sullivan.
Yes or no?

557
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,360
Two weeks.

558
01:02:05,867 --> 01:02:08,869
I'll get her to tolerate me.

559
01:02:15,876 --> 01:02:17,418
Hm?

560
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,036
A. It's the first of many.

561
01:02:22,425 --> 01:02:24,465
26.

562
01:03:17,146 --> 01:03:20,182
- Does she know where she is?
- No.

563
01:03:20,317 --> 01:03:24,231
For all she knows
she could be in another town.

564
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:45,750
- That's her sign for me.
- Yes, I know. In two weeks.

565
01:03:45,884 --> 01:03:49,050
Miss Annie, please be good to her.

566
01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:51,800
These two weeks,
try to be very good to her.

567
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:53,971
I will.

568
01:03:54,684 --> 01:03:57,175
(grunts)

569
01:04:13,869 --> 01:04:16,195
No!

570
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:45,130
(doll makes sound)

571
01:04:47,237 --> 01:04:49,277
(Helen sobs)

572
01:05:06,255 --> 01:05:07,880
Two weeks.

573
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,465
What did I get into now?

574
01:05:19,353 --> 01:05:21,391
(Helen moaning)

575
01:05:31,947 --> 01:05:33,987
(Annie sobbing)

576
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:13,688
Oh... oh... oh...

577
01:06:17,952 --> 01:06:20,407
(sobbing)

578
01:06:26,126 --> 01:06:28,166
(child sobbing)

579
01:07:00,871 --> 01:07:02,280
Jimmy!

580
01:07:02,414 --> 01:07:04,452
Yes?

581
01:07:20,806 --> 01:07:23,262
Did you call me?

582
01:07:27,438 --> 01:07:29,478
No.

583
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:38,103
- What are you doing here?
- Taking a turn. Is everything all right?

584
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:42,907
Just a dream?

585
01:07:45,664 --> 01:07:49,331
How old was he? The other Jimmy.

586
01:07:50,378 --> 01:07:52,619
Helen's age.

587
01:07:53,882 --> 01:07:56,373
How did he die?

588
01:07:56,599 --> 01:07:58,751
He had a tubercular hip.

589
01:07:59,762 --> 01:08:02,170
Oh, we were a pair, all right.

590
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:05,841
Me blind and him on a crutch.

591
01:08:05,978 --> 01:08:08,016
When did he die?

592
01:08:10,356 --> 01:08:12,764
11 years ago, this May.

593
01:08:13,609 --> 01:08:15,649
You've had no one to dream about since?

594
01:08:15,779 --> 01:08:17,818
No, one's enough.

595
01:08:19,073 --> 01:08:23,229
You don't let go of things easily, do you?

596
01:08:23,869 --> 01:08:27,037
You'd be quite a handsome girl
if it weren't for your eyes.

597
01:08:27,164 --> 01:08:29,917
- No one's told you?
- Everyone.

598
01:08:31,086 --> 01:08:35,166
You'd be quite a gentleman
if it wasn't for your manners.

599
01:08:35,297 --> 01:08:39,925
You wouldn't say that to me
if you didn't have your glasses on.

600
01:08:42,139 --> 01:08:46,489
How will you win her hand now,
in this place?

601
01:08:46,726 --> 01:08:50,143
Do I know? I lost my temper
and here we are.

602
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:53,890
I'm counting on her.
That little head is dying to know.

603
01:08:54,024 --> 01:08:56,266
- Know what?
- Anything.

604
01:08:56,403 --> 01:09:00,731
Any and every crumb in God's creation.
I've got to use that appetite too.

605
01:09:00,865 --> 01:09:03,106
- Maybe she'll teach you.
- Of course.

606
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:05,448
That she isn't.

607
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:11,663
That there's such a thing as dullness
of heart, acceptance, and letting go.

608
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:14,462
Sooner or later we all give up, don't we?

609
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:19,047
Maybe you all do.
It's my idea of the original sin.

610
01:09:19,176 --> 01:09:20,373
- What is?
- Giving up.

611
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,966
You won't open her.

612
01:09:23,095 --> 01:09:27,923
Why can't you let her be and have
some pity on her for bein' what she is?

613
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,760
If I'd ever once thought like that,
I'd be dead.

614
01:09:31,895 --> 01:09:35,845
You will be. Why trouble?

615
01:09:36,734 --> 01:09:38,976
Or will you teach me?

616
01:10:00,382 --> 01:10:02,210
No.

617
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:05,800
No pity. I won't have it.

618
01:10:08,265 --> 01:10:11,300
On either of us.

619
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:13,387
(cries out)

620
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:16,680
I will touch you!

621
01:10:19,277 --> 01:10:21,317
But how?

622
01:10:21,445 --> 01:10:23,485
How do I?

623
01:10:25,742 --> 01:10:26,820
Percy!

624
01:10:26,952 --> 01:10:31,280
Percy, get up. Get out of bed
and come in here. I need you.

625
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,292
Percy? You awake?

626
01:10:41,423 --> 01:10:43,251
No.

627
01:10:44,261 --> 01:10:48,175
How would you like to play
a nice game with Helen?

628
01:10:54,729 --> 01:10:56,769
Touch her hand.

629
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:59,729
(makes guttural sound)

630
01:11:08,702 --> 01:11:10,740
Let me go! Let me go!

631
01:11:14,207 --> 01:11:17,078
She try and talk. She gonna hit me.

632
01:11:18,377 --> 01:11:20,916
She can talk, if she only knew.

633
01:11:21,046 --> 01:11:24,213
I'll show you how. She makes letters.

634
01:11:24,341 --> 01:11:27,212
This is C...

635
01:11:27,345 --> 01:11:30,679
C... C...

636
01:11:32,809 --> 01:11:37,351
She's mad at me. She won't play.
But she knows lots of letters.

637
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:39,699
This is A.

638
01:11:40,233 --> 01:11:44,942
C... A...

639
01:11:47,114 --> 01:11:52,738
C... A...

640
01:11:54,038 --> 01:11:56,078
C...

641
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:09,210
C-a-k-e.

642
01:12:09,345 --> 01:12:11,884
She spells cake, she gets cake.

643
01:12:12,015 --> 01:12:14,685
She doesn't know it means this.
Isn't that funny?

644
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:19,353
She knows how to spell it,
but doesn't know she knows.

645
01:12:21,024 --> 01:12:25,069
All right. If she won't play it with me,
I'll play it with you.

646
01:12:25,194 --> 01:12:27,188
- Would you like to learn a new word?
- No.

647
01:12:27,322 --> 01:12:31,021
M-i-l-k.

648
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,623
This is M...

649
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:48,259
I... That's an easy one.
Just the little finger.

650
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:53,219
L...

651
01:13:12,951 --> 01:13:18,110
Oh, why should I talk to you?
I'm teaching a new word to Percy.

652
01:13:33,095 --> 01:13:35,421
So you're jealous, are you?

653
01:13:38,018 --> 01:13:40,056
All right.

654
01:14:11,676 --> 01:14:14,297
Good.

655
01:14:14,429 --> 01:14:18,212
I'm finally back to where I can touch you.

656
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:20,389
Touch and go.

657
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:24,052
Well, no love lost, but here we go.

658
01:14:42,707 --> 01:14:46,704
You can go to bed now.
You've earned your sleep.

659
01:14:48,171 --> 01:14:50,211
Thank you.

660
01:15:35,886 --> 01:15:38,756
Now all I have to teach you is...

661
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:42,637
one word.

662
01:15:44,936 --> 01:15:46,728
Everything.

663
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:11,250
(doll makes sound)

664
01:16:11,837 --> 01:16:14,756
Hush, little baby, don't say a word.

665
01:16:14,882 --> 01:16:17,966
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

666
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:26,804
If that mockingbird don't sing

667
01:16:28,395 --> 01:16:35,609
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring

668
01:16:37,613 --> 01:16:45,076
If that diamond ring turns brass

669
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:54,126
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass

670
01:16:56,382 --> 01:17:04,046
If that looking glass gets broke

671
01:17:05,266 --> 01:17:12,894
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat

672
01:17:14,859 --> 01:17:20,695
If that billy goat...

673
01:18:29,225 --> 01:18:31,431
On my way to the office.
Thought I'd look in.

674
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:34,395
Well, she's toleratin' me
and I'm toleratin' her.

675
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,393
Where is... What's wrong?

676
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:41,060
I think she should dress herself.
She thinks she shouldn't.

677
01:18:41,195 --> 01:18:43,319
- This her breakfast?
- Yes.

678
01:18:43,448 --> 01:18:46,365
- She wouldn't eat?
- She'd love to eat it.

679
01:18:46,493 --> 01:18:48,235
Why haven't you given it to her?

680
01:18:48,369 --> 01:18:52,034
I will, when she dresses herself.
She's thinking it over.

681
01:18:52,164 --> 01:18:56,244
- You intend to starve her into obeyin'?
- She won't starve, she'll learn.

682
01:18:56,377 --> 01:18:58,998
All's fair in love and war, Captain Keller.

683
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:04,125
- This is hardly a war.
- Well, it's not love. A siege is a siege.

684
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:07,215
Miss Sullivan, do you like the child?

685
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:10,429
Do you?

686
01:19:23,738 --> 01:19:26,194
I'm beginning to.

687
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:38,332
Beads.

688
01:19:38,461 --> 01:19:40,600
It has a name.

689
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,707
Tree. It has a name.

690
01:19:50,681 --> 01:19:52,341
Tree.

691
01:19:53,769 --> 01:19:56,010
Bird. It has a name.

692
01:19:57,063 --> 01:19:58,143
Yes...

693
01:19:58,273 --> 01:20:00,313
No!

694
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:06,654
W-a-t-e-r. Water.

695
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:14,162
Oh...

696
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:17,954
Oh!

697
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:36,681
No!

698
01:20:41,315 --> 01:20:44,103
W-a-t-e-r.

699
01:20:45,194 --> 01:20:46,771
Water.

700
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:23,019
Discipline... discipline.

701
01:21:25,652 --> 01:21:29,317
Disinter, disinterested...

702
01:21:31,115 --> 01:21:33,210
Disinterested.

703
01:21:33,702 --> 01:21:36,786
Where's discipline? What a dictionary.

704
01:21:36,912 --> 01:21:41,908
You have to know how to spell it
before you can look up how to spell it.

705
01:21:42,042 --> 01:21:44,082
Disinter.

706
01:21:45,296 --> 01:21:47,336
Disciple.

707
01:21:49,676 --> 01:21:51,798
Discipline.

708
01:21:51,927 --> 01:21:53,967
Dis-cipline.

709
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:01,020
You're not to overwork your eyes,
Miss Annie.

710
01:22:01,688 --> 01:22:06,018
Whatever I spell to Helen,
I'd better spell right.

711
01:22:26,921 --> 01:22:32,841
- You've taught her so much this week.
- Not enough. Obedience isn't enough.

712
01:22:32,969 --> 01:22:37,048
Well... she learned two nouns
this morning. Key and water.

713
01:22:37,181 --> 01:22:38,724
- But not...?
- No.

714
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:44,140
Not that they mean things. It's still
a finger game to her. No meaning.

715
01:22:44,271 --> 01:22:46,311
But she will.

716
01:22:49,069 --> 01:22:53,612
Might I... Might I take her
for one walk this evening?

717
01:22:57,661 --> 01:23:00,827
Shall we play our finger game,
Mrs Keller?

718
01:23:00,956 --> 01:23:03,791
- Next week seems so...
- Spell it.

719
01:23:03,917 --> 01:23:06,206
...so far off.
- Spell it.

720
01:23:06,336 --> 01:23:11,293
If she ever learns, you'll have
a lot to tell each other. Start now.

721
01:23:16,637 --> 01:23:21,631
In... under, under. Yes, crochet.

722
01:23:21,768 --> 01:23:24,390
C-r-o-s-h...

723
01:23:27,148 --> 01:23:29,640
C-r-o-s-h...

724
01:23:33,947 --> 01:23:35,985
Sewing.

725
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:41,827
Oh, it has a name, and sewing isn't it.

726
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:48,310
E-g-g.

727
01:23:51,631 --> 01:23:54,038
Egg.

728
01:23:54,176 --> 01:23:58,469
It has a name.
The name stands for the thing.

729
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:02,172
Oh, it's so simple.

730
01:24:03,351 --> 01:24:05,640
Simple as birth to explain.

731
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:07,894
Helen.

732
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:12,234
Helen, the chick has to
come out of its shell sometime.

733
01:24:14,904 --> 01:24:16,896
(gasps)

734
01:24:21,161 --> 01:24:24,180
You come out too.

735
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:57,103
Thimble.

736
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,444
No, not key. Thimble.

737
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:06,323
T-r-e-e.

738
01:25:06,456 --> 01:25:08,780
W-a-t...

739
01:25:11,293 --> 01:25:14,128
M-i-I...

740
01:25:14,255 --> 01:25:16,497
Good girl.

741
01:25:18,635 --> 01:25:20,877
D-o-l-I.

742
01:25:22,305 --> 01:25:24,926
M-i...

743
01:25:25,057 --> 01:25:27,097
(sighs)

744
01:25:31,729 --> 01:25:34,130
Oh...

745
01:25:36,278 --> 01:25:39,693
"I feel every day
more and more inadequate."

746
01:25:39,823 --> 01:25:44,780
"My letters must show that
I need a teacher as much as Helen."

747
01:25:47,497 --> 01:25:49,738
I need help too.

748
01:25:55,212 --> 01:25:57,751
Who?

749
01:25:57,881 --> 01:26:02,841
In all the world there isn't a soul
who can tell me how to reach you.

750
01:26:06,432 --> 01:26:08,260
How do I reach you?

751
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:11,469
Doesn't she need affection too?

752
01:26:12,939 --> 01:26:17,103
She never shows me she needs it.
She won't have any caressing.

753
01:26:17,234 --> 01:26:21,314
What would another week accomplish?
We are more than satisfied.

754
01:26:21,448 --> 01:26:24,117
You taught her things to do, to behave.

755
01:26:24,242 --> 01:26:26,779
- So manageable. Cleaner.
- Cleaner?

756
01:26:26,912 --> 01:26:29,449
We say cleanliness is next to godliness.

757
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,332
Cleanliness is next to nothing.

758
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:35,708
- Give me more time alone with her.
- No.

759
01:26:37,671 --> 01:26:39,712
What is she spellin'?

760
01:26:41,426 --> 01:26:43,086
Water?

761
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,792
Teaching a dog to spell?

762
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:50,059
The dog doesn't know what she means
any more than she knows what you mean.

763
01:26:50,185 --> 01:26:52,971
I think you ask too much of her,
and yourself.

764
01:26:53,104 --> 01:26:57,315
God may not have meant Helen
to have the... eyes you speak of.

765
01:26:57,943 --> 01:27:00,778
I mean her to.

766
01:27:00,904 --> 01:27:03,145
What is it to you?

767
01:27:09,078 --> 01:27:13,029
- Half a week.
- An agreement is an agreement.

768
01:27:13,166 --> 01:27:15,074
Mrs Keller...

769
01:27:16,127 --> 01:27:18,368
I want her back.

770
01:27:21,257 --> 01:27:23,296
I'll send Viney to help you pack.

771
01:27:23,426 --> 01:27:27,423
Not until 6 o'clock.
I have her until 6 o'clock.

772
01:27:30,266 --> 01:27:31,926
6 o'clock.

773
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,100
Come, Katie.

774
01:27:40,652 --> 01:27:43,735
Yes, what is it to me? They're satisfied.

775
01:27:43,863 --> 01:27:47,314
Give them back their child
and their dog, both housebroken.

776
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:49,988
Everyone's satisfied but me.

777
01:27:51,203 --> 01:27:53,243
And you.

778
01:27:59,878 --> 01:28:01,421
Feel it.

779
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:03,753
Reach.

780
01:28:03,884 --> 01:28:05,922
I wanted to teach you.

781
01:28:06,927 --> 01:28:08,338
Oh...

782
01:28:08,471 --> 01:28:14,724
Everything the earth is full of, Helen.
Everything on it that's ours for a wink.

783
01:28:14,853 --> 01:28:21,188
And what we are on it. The light
we bring to it and leave behind in words.

784
01:28:21,318 --> 01:28:26,193
You can see 5,000 years back
in the light of words.

785
01:28:26,323 --> 01:28:30,485
Everything we feel, think,

786
01:28:30,618 --> 01:28:32,944
know, and share in words.

787
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:39,890
So not a soul is in darkness,
or done with even in the grave.

788
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:43,668
But I know.

789
01:28:44,882 --> 01:28:49,296
I know one word and
I can put the world in your hand.

790
01:28:50,221 --> 01:28:53,804
And whatever it is to me, I won't take less.

791
01:28:54,935 --> 01:28:57,090
How...

792
01:28:57,479 --> 01:28:59,689
How do I tell you that...

793
01:29:01,399 --> 01:29:04,899
this... means a word?

794
01:29:05,028 --> 01:29:08,313
And the word means this thing, wool.

795
01:29:10,283 --> 01:29:12,323
Or this.

796
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:19,279
S-t-o-o-I means this thing.

797
01:29:21,252 --> 01:29:23,659
Dress.

798
01:29:23,796 --> 01:29:25,920
F-a-c-e. Face.

799
01:29:26,048 --> 01:29:28,088
(clock striking)

800
01:29:38,645 --> 01:29:42,095
M-o-t-h-e-r.

801
01:29:43,274 --> 01:29:45,314
Mother.

802
01:29:46,027 --> 01:29:49,859
M-o-t-h-e-r.

803
01:29:49,989 --> 01:29:51,899
Mother.

804
01:29:52,033 --> 01:29:54,488
Let her come!

805
01:31:39,807 --> 01:31:41,847
(knocking)

806
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:46,460
Come in.

807
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:49,601
Miss Annie, your first month's salary.

808
01:31:49,734 --> 01:31:51,774
With many more to come, I trust.

809
01:31:51,903 --> 01:31:54,440
It doesn't pay our debt
for what you've done.

810
01:31:55,229 --> 01:31:59,318
I've taught her one thing: No.
Don't do this, don't do that.

811
01:31:59,453 --> 01:32:03,284
- It's more than we could do...
- I wanted to teach her what language is.

812
01:32:03,414 --> 01:32:06,202
I know without it
to do nothing but obey is no gift.

813
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:10,319
Obedience without understanding is
a blindness. Is that all I've wished on her?

814
01:32:10,713 --> 01:32:12,752
- No.
- Maybe.

815
01:32:13,341 --> 01:32:15,712
I don't know what else to do.

816
01:32:15,844 --> 01:32:20,470
I simply go on and keep doing what I've
done and have faith that inside she's...

817
01:32:21,489 --> 01:32:24,810
that inside is waiting,
like water underground.

818
01:32:26,438 --> 01:32:29,225
- You can help, Captain Keller.
- How?

819
01:32:29,733 --> 01:32:32,270
The world is not an easy place
for anyone.

820
01:32:32,402 --> 01:32:34,774
I don't want her just to obey.

821
01:32:34,904 --> 01:32:37,940
But to let her have her way
in everything is a lie.

822
01:32:38,073 --> 01:32:40,113
To her.

823
01:32:43,412 --> 01:32:45,859
And I don't even love her.

824
01:32:49,293 --> 01:32:51,750
She's not my child.

825
01:32:56,676 --> 01:32:58,716
Well...

826
01:33:00,055 --> 01:33:03,091
You've got to stand between
that lie and her.

827
01:33:04,309 --> 01:33:06,349
Agreed.

828
01:33:07,938 --> 01:33:10,144
Won't you come now to supper?

829
01:33:13,652 --> 01:33:15,145
Yes.

830
01:33:18,113 --> 01:33:21,500
I used to wonder
how I could earn a living.

831
01:33:21,659 --> 01:33:23,900
Oh, you do.

832
01:33:25,372 --> 01:33:29,417
I really do. Now the question is,
can I survive it?

833
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,701
Oh... (chuckles)

834
01:34:01,365 --> 01:34:04,319
Oh, the keys!

835
01:34:04,453 --> 01:34:07,157
Yes, I'll keep the keys.

836
01:34:07,288 --> 01:34:11,073
I think we've had enough
of locked doors too.

837
01:34:22,136 --> 01:34:24,675
Will you say the grace, Jimmy?

838
01:34:26,891 --> 01:34:31,269
"And Jacob was left alone and wrestled
with an angel till the breaking of the day."

839
01:34:31,395 --> 01:34:35,096
"And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
out of joint as he wrestled with him."

840
01:34:35,233 --> 01:34:38,270
"And the angel said
'Let me go, for the day breaketh."'

841
01:34:38,403 --> 01:34:41,737
"And Jacob said 'I will not let thee go,
except thou bless me."'

842
01:34:41,864 --> 01:34:43,692
Amen.

843
01:34:43,824 --> 01:34:45,283
Oh, you angel.

844
01:34:45,409 --> 01:34:50,072
- That's a very strange grace, James.
- It's from the Good Book, isn't it?

845
01:34:50,207 --> 01:34:52,246
Of course it is. Didn't you know?

846
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:54,747
- Yes, I knew.
- Well, why ask?

847
01:34:54,877 --> 01:34:57,664
It is from the Good Book
and therefore a fitting grace.

848
01:34:57,796 --> 01:34:59,920
Well, I don't know about that.

849
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:04,961
There's a lot of things in the Good Book
that I don't care to hear just before eating.

850
01:35:05,096 --> 01:35:09,889
Well, fitting in the sense that Jacob's thigh
was out of joint, and so is this piggy's.

851
01:35:10,018 --> 01:35:12,060
- James, I declare!
- Pickles, Aunt Ev?

852
01:35:12,688 --> 01:35:15,439
I should say so.
You know my opinion of your pickles.

853
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:20,529
This is the end of them, I'm afraid.
I didn't put up nearly enough last summer.

854
01:35:20,654 --> 01:35:24,402
Reverend looked in today
to complain his hens had stopped layin'.

855
01:35:24,829 --> 01:35:27,283
Poor fella, he was out of joint. All that...

856
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:30,079
- I've always suspected those hens.
- Of what?

857
01:35:30,204 --> 01:35:33,039
I think they're papists. Has he tried...

858
01:35:33,166 --> 01:35:36,119
Now you're pulling my lower extremity.

859
01:35:36,252 --> 01:35:40,914
The first thing you know
we'll be having another... one of our...

860
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:50,439
- Miss Annie, it's a very special day.
- It will be, when I give in to that.

861
01:35:50,725 --> 01:35:52,884
Please. I've hardly welcomed her home.

862
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,600
- Captain Keller.
- Katie, we had a little talk.

863
01:35:55,646 --> 01:35:59,858
- Miss Annie feels if we indulge Helen...
- It's a napkin. It's not breakable.

864
01:35:59,984 --> 01:36:02,854
And everything she's learned is.

865
01:36:04,405 --> 01:36:07,158
Mrs Keller, we shouldn't
play tug of war for her.

866
01:36:07,283 --> 01:36:10,540
Either give her to me
or you keep her from kicking.

867
01:36:10,662 --> 01:36:13,448
- What do you wish to do?
- Let me take her from the table.

868
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:15,239
Let her stay. She's only a child...

869
01:36:15,707 --> 01:36:20,340
- And ask outsiders not to interfere.
- Outsider? Why, I'm the child's aunt.

870
01:36:20,713 --> 01:36:24,378
Will this once hurt so much, Miss Annie?

871
01:36:25,399 --> 01:36:27,046
I've made all of Helen's favourite foods.

872
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:30,970
It's her homecomin' party, Miss Annie.

873
01:36:38,314 --> 01:36:40,510
- She's testing you.
- She's testing you.

874
01:36:40,649 --> 01:36:43,402
Jimmy, be quiet.
Now that she's home, naturally...

875
01:36:43,779 --> 01:36:47,822
She wants to see what'll happen at
your hands. I said it was my main worry.

876
01:36:47,948 --> 01:36:51,947
- But she's not kickin' now.
- And not learning not to.

877
01:36:53,287 --> 01:36:55,694
She'll live up to what you demand
and no more.

878
01:36:55,832 --> 01:36:57,077
- She's testing you.
- Jimmy.

879
01:36:57,207 --> 01:36:59,913
- I have an opinion.
- No one's interested in it.

880
01:37:00,045 --> 01:37:03,792
I'm interested.
Of course she's testing me.

881
01:37:03,922 --> 01:37:07,422
Let me keep her to what she's learned
and she'll go on learning.

882
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:10,755
Take her out of my hands
and it all comes apart.

883
01:37:14,725 --> 01:37:17,893
Be bountiful. It's at her expense.

884
01:37:21,106 --> 01:37:24,975
Please pass me more
of her favourite food.

885
01:37:35,747 --> 01:37:38,664
- Take her, Miss Annie.
- Thank you.

886
01:37:39,792 --> 01:37:42,539
I'm afraid you're the difficulty, Miss Annie.

887
01:37:42,671 --> 01:37:45,791
I'll keep her to what she's learned.
You're quite right.

888
01:37:45,923 --> 01:37:50,466
But I don't see we need send her
from the table. She's the guest of honour.

889
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:52,801
Bring her plate back.

890
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:55,302
If she were a seeing child, you wouldn't...

891
01:37:55,434 --> 01:38:00,011
She's not! I think
some compromise is called for.

892
01:38:00,145 --> 01:38:02,139
Bring her plate.

893
01:38:02,273 --> 01:38:04,313
Please!

894
01:38:09,155 --> 01:38:14,826
Occasionally another hand
can smooth things out.

895
01:38:14,953 --> 01:38:18,322
There. Now, shall we start all over?

896
01:38:23,377 --> 01:38:26,627
(James) I think we've started all over.

897
01:38:26,756 --> 01:38:30,006
Don't get up.
Don't smooth anything else out for me.

898
01:38:30,135 --> 01:38:34,460
Don't interfere in any way. I treat her like
a seeing child because I ask her to see.

899
01:38:34,722 --> 01:38:37,676
I expect her to see! Don't undo what I do!

900
01:38:37,809 --> 01:38:40,097
- Where are you going?
- To fill this pitcher.

901
01:38:40,229 --> 01:38:43,119
You let her speak to you like that?
A creature who works for you?

902
01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:46,262
No, I don't.

903
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,859
- Let her go.
- What?

904
01:38:47,985 --> 01:38:50,440
I said let her go! She's right.

905
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:52,113
She's right.

906
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,814
Kate's right, I'm right, and you're wrong.

907
01:38:54,951 --> 01:38:57,621
Has it never occurred to you
that on one occasion

908
01:38:57,746 --> 01:39:00,615
you might be consummately wrong?

909
01:39:07,713 --> 01:39:09,956
All right. Pump.

910
01:39:11,009 --> 01:39:13,333
No, she's not here. Pump.

911
01:39:18,225 --> 01:39:20,630
W-a-t-e-r. Water.

912
01:39:20,644 --> 01:39:23,015
It has a name. W-a-t...

913
01:39:47,127 --> 01:39:51,755
Wah... wah.

914
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:59,097
Wah... wah.

915
01:40:22,956 --> 01:40:24,996
Yes.

916
01:40:29,796 --> 01:40:31,255
Yes.

917
01:40:45,228 --> 01:40:47,101
Yes.

918
01:40:47,229 --> 01:40:49,270
Oh, my dear.

919
01:40:56,698 --> 01:40:58,738
Ground.

920
01:41:03,747 --> 01:41:05,786
Yes!

921
01:41:10,949 --> 01:41:13,350
Pump.

922
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,425
Yes.

923
01:41:21,972 --> 01:41:24,012
Tree.

924
01:41:28,313 --> 01:41:30,020
Step.

925
01:41:30,148 --> 01:41:32,188
Mrs Keller. Mrs Keller!

926
01:41:34,027 --> 01:41:35,402
Bell.

927
01:41:35,779 --> 01:41:36,904
Mrs Keller!

928
01:41:37,029 --> 01:41:39,438
Mrs Keller... Mrs Keller.

929
01:41:42,828 --> 01:41:45,199
Mother. Papa.

930
01:41:45,329 --> 01:41:47,369
She knows!

931
01:42:19,155 --> 01:42:21,194
Teacher.

932
01:42:35,755 --> 01:42:37,795
Teacher.

933
01:43:17,713 --> 01:43:19,421
Teacher.

934
01:45:11,203 --> 01:45:15,449
I... love...

935
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:22,458
Helen.
