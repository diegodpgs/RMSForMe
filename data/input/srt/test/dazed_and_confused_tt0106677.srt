1
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,853
Last Day of School
May 28, 1976 - 1:05 P.M.

2
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:44,607
I'm headed this way.

3
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,694
Later. - So what did we decide?
- About what?

4
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:50,321
About tonight?

5
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:54,033
I'll probably get hung up
with the guys.

6
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,578
Why don't we just meet at the party?
- Okay.

7
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:01,499
Wouldn't want you waitin' around
for me all night. - Alright. - Cool.

8
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,126
See ya later.
- Bye.

9
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:17,932
Slater - san!

10
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:25,773
How's it goin'?
- Fixin' to be a lot better.

11
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:30,611
What time is your party, man?
- 9:30, man.

12
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,116
I'll be there, man.

13
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,118
See ya later, alligator.

14
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:41,414
Wait! I gotta cruise by this afternoon
on a little business,

15
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:46,502
if you know what I'm talkin' about.
- That. - It's what I'm talking about.

16
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:50,548
I'm fuckin' wasted.

17
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:58,514
Walkin' down the hall by myself,
smokin' a "J" with 50 elves.

18
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,226
Later.
- Woodward, Bernstein.

19
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:07,773
That makes you Deep Throat!
Is this a smoked or liquid lunch?

20
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:09,692
Smoked, right?

21
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:13,571
Are we gonna play poker tonight?
- Count me out.

22
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:16,908
I'll probably be going
to Pickford's party.

23
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:21,954
We should do that. We can play
poker anytime. - Go to a party?

24
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,206
Mike! Cynthia...?
- Don't worry about it.

25
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:28,878
I don't feel comfortable at those
things. - Pick us up at 8.

26
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:32,381
I guess we're going to the party.

27
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:37,803
I gotta tell you
about this dream. - Oh yeah?

28
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,059
But you gotta promise
not to tell anyone. Say "l promise."

29
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:46,854
I promise
not to tell anyone. - Thank you.

30
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:52,109
Okay, there I am.
And I'm gettin' it on

31
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:56,405
with this perfect
female body, but...

32
00:04:58,157 --> 00:05:00,368
What?
- I can't say.

33
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:06,415
You can't build me up and not deliver!
"Perfect female body." Not bad.

34
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,877
But the head of Abraham Lincoln.

35
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:14,173
I mean, the hat and the beard...

36
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,968
Oh well, best not think too deeply.
- Best not.

37
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:22,765
I gotta get some stuff from Mr.
Birchfield. See ya in a few minutes.

38
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:27,561
"Gilligan's transistor radio."
That was a good one!

39
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:34,694
What about that one where that sexy
surfer catches that huge wave!

40
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:37,029
You remember that?
- Oh yeah.

41
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:40,074
The mosquitoes!
- Pink, let's go!

42
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:41,951
Come on!

43
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:48,124
I can't go until Miss Wilk gets here.
So get Benny. - Alright.

44
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:53,295
What?
- Coach gave me something for you.

45
00:05:56,715 --> 00:06:01,387
They're really doin' this?
- He wants 'em all back today.

46
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:06,267
Everybody's signing it?
- Just to get him off our backs.

47
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:10,521
You sign it.
Never think about it again!

48
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,607
You're gonna make
a big deal outta this, aren't you?

49
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:20,739
You're gettin' air from here.
It's no good. You see this?

50
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,617
It's gotta be tight

51
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:26,370
to get a good hit.

52
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:41,427
I ain't believin' that about Bonham's
1 - hour drum solo. - 2 minutes.

53
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:44,763
You couldn't handle that on acid.

54
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,442
We're gonna go to the bathroom.
Could you let Miss Wilks know?

55
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,820
This is totally amazing!

56
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:05,868
"l voluntarily agree to not indulge
in any alcohol, drugs or engage

57
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:10,623
in any other illegal activity that may
jeopardize the years of hard work

58
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,169
we have committed to a championship
season in '76." - Bullshit!

59
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:20,424
You guys are signing? - Apparently.
- What next? Urine tests?

60
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:25,012
I didn't know drugs are such a problem
they had resort to neo- McCarthyism!

61
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:30,351
They're afraid we'll have a good time!
- The "age- suppressing- youth thing".

62
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:34,230
"Neo- McCarthyism!" I like that!
- That's good, Tony.

63
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:40,069
You were in class trying to list
all the "Gilligan's lsland" episodes!

64
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,448
What're you talking about, girl?
- You weren't thinking about it, huh?

65
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:49,328
"Gilligan's lsland?" - It's what 's
called a male pornographic fantasy.

66
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:51,914
Oh my!
- Think about it!

67
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:55,834
You're alone on a deserted island
with two readily available women:

68
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:58,671
one a seductive sex- goddess type,

69
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:02,216
the other a healthy girl- next- door
type with a nice butt.

70
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,386
So guys have it all...
the Madonna and the whore.

71
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:09,014
Women get nothing.
We get a geek,

72
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:13,102
an overweight, middle- aged guy,
some nerdy scientific type.

73
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:17,189
The professor is sexy.
- Pink!

74
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,569
Come on, man! - We're off
to raise some hell. Look at that!

75
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:26,573
Hey, you guys!

76
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:31,870
Wait up! Benny, I have a favor
to ask you. - What do you need?

77
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:35,958
Take it easy on my brother
this summer. - Mitch Kramer?

78
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,543
Yeah, Mitch Kramer.

79
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,838
I'm gonna give him a beating!

80
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:46,635
Don't get him more than the others.
He's kinda little. - You got our word.

81
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:50,431
Little brother'll be okay.
- Thanks. See you guys!

82
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,185
These guys, I don't know...

83
00:08:56,437 --> 00:09:01,525
Just a little bullshit, right?
- Major bullshit. He's a dead man!

84
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,152
Shotgun!

85
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:11,160
Check it out. I been waitin' 3 years
for this. Those junior high kids

86
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:15,622
are dead meat.
We're gonna beat 'em!

87
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:29,011
Okay, you freshman fucks,
listen up!

88
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:31,930
It's your lucky day.

89
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,933
Usually you spend your freshman summer
getting your asses busted

90
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,062
and running for your lives.
But this year, we feel sorry for you.

91
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,273
So we're gonna take it easy on you

92
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,817
and save us all a lot of time.

93
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:48,530
So if you meet here
after school today,

94
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:53,452
you'll only get one lick from each
of us. But you run like cowards,

95
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:58,165
it's open season all summer.

96
00:09:58,582 --> 00:09:59,750
Oh yeah, Mitch Kramer!

97
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:01,919
Mitchy!

98
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:09,760
We're lookin' for you, pal.
Your ass'll be purple...

99
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,638
Have a nice afternoon.

100
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:19,519
You better get outta town. Spend
the summer with your grandparents.

101
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,858
You are gonna show up
to our game tonight?

102
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:30,364
I'm pitching. I kinda have to. - How
should we inscribe your tombstone?

103
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:35,077
How 'bout "Bent over"?
- Right, piss- ant!

104
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:39,331
Why aren't they after anybody else?
- They are, man. Believe me.

105
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:41,541
I know, man.

106
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,170
Come on, Mel, hop on.
- Let's go!

107
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,306
Shit!

108
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,102
Hey, Coach.

109
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,522
So tell me,

110
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:08,652
any of you girls gonna be ready to
play football this fall? - Don't know.

111
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:14,616
I've been doing so good in English,
I figured I'd be a writer.

112
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:20,998
You wouldn't know how to write your
name if it wasn't on your locker.

113
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:25,669
Don't go soft on me this summer,
sitting around the pool all day,

114
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:28,088
chasing the muff around.

115
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:33,510
Hell, man! My grandmother's
quicker than you pansies!

116
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,887
'course she's 6'3", 250

117
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:40,058
and runs a 4.5 40.
- What's the matter, Floyd?

118
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:45,272
Quarterbacks don't have to do what
coaches say? You give him that pledge?

119
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:48,984
The pledge, did you give it to him?
- Yeah, it's right here.

120
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:54,573
If you could get that to us by the end
of the day. You guys see that he does.

121
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,159
Alright, Coach.
- See ya!

122
00:11:57,993 --> 00:11:59,244
Randy Floyd!

123
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:06,168
You need an attitude adjustment.
Get your priorities straight!

124
00:12:06,585 --> 00:12:09,087
And watch out
with that other crowd.

125
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,757
Don't think I haven't noticed. Hey!

126
00:12:13,258 --> 00:12:14,551
I want that paper

127
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,847
on my desk before you leave here
today, you hear me?

128
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,230
"Attitude adjustment!"

129
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:32,861
"Priorities!" - Runs with that
bad crowd. Watch yourself.

130
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:39,826
Well, I got Coach's and everybody's
attitude- adjusted priorities here.

131
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,787
Yeah, that's good.
- Yeah.

132
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:49,753
You hear O'Bannion flunked?
- What a dumb shit!

133
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,468
You all ready to bust some ass?

134
00:12:56,885 --> 00:13:01,640
What's up, Don, Benny, Melvin? Good
to see ya. - See ya in half an hour.

135
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:08,980
We gotta take your truck. I'm low
on gas. - My truck?

136
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,818
What're you doing?
Picking up trash?

137
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:16,905
I was waiting for one of them idiot
coaches to piss me off.

138
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:22,202
You take the thing too personally.
You gotta... shake it off.

139
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:25,539
Ever thought why we play football?

140
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:30,085
How many times you gotten laid
because you're a football player?

141
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:33,338
I don't know.

142
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:35,715
A few, probably.
- A few?

143
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:40,762
I bet we could do just as well
if we were in a band or something.

144
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:47,018
I gotta put in a final appearance...
- Who you got going in there?

145
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:50,313
Vicky.

146
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,525
Come on, let's go get naked now!

147
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,778
Come on!
- Mr. Dawson?

148
00:13:57,195 --> 00:14:02,200
Take it somewhere else. Mr. Floyd,
are you gracing us with your presence?

149
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,911
Might as well.

150
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:06,579
Ginny?

151
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:12,294
You and I could get together. It'll
be illegal. I'll keep things quiet.

152
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,637
At the party there's gonna be a girl
with knockers this big. - Bullshit!

153
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:26,016
Promise. Two handfuls.
- No way! - Hey!

154
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:33,023
Pentico's got his brother's car.
Let's go, man. Cool.

155
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,443
Go talk to him.
- I'm not going alone.

156
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,990
Mr. Payne? Sir?

157
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:48,663
Every second you let us out early
would increase our chance of survival.

158
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:53,543
Like our sergeant told us
before one trip into the jungle:

159
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,670
"Men,

160
00:14:56,421 --> 00:15:00,884
50 of you are leaving on a mission.
25 ain't comin' back."

161
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,225
The '68 Democratic Convention

162
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,228
was probably the most bitchin' time
in my life.

163
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:19,444
One more thing: This summer, with all
the bicentennial 4th of July brouhaha,

164
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:24,741
you're actually celebrating a bunch of
slave- owning, aristocratic white males

165
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,119
who didn't want to pay their taxes.

166
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:07,260
Jump in! Come on!

167
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:14,809
Hurry up, Hirschfelder, or we're
gonna leave your ass. - Let's go!

168
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:17,061
Oh shit!

169
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,064
Ducks on the pond!
- How're you doin', boys?

170
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,659
Wake up, bitch!
Open! Open!

171
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,293
Hey, open!

172
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,343
What do you think?
- Alright. Let's go.

173
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:51,763
Hey, you! Come here.

174
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:55,308
You.

175
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,810
Who are you?

176
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:01,856
Nobody. I mean,
I wasn't in the truck.

177
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:04,525
Are you a freshman?
- Yeah.

178
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:08,571
Are you in or are you out?
- ln. - Let's go.

179
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:58,454
We really pissed 'em off. Just drop me
off at my house. You still with me?

180
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:00,957
My house!

181
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,961
They're slowing down.
You get out and get 'em!

182
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,797
Good luck, man. Be there tonight!

183
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:20,476
Nice try, freshman.

184
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,564
For being brave little kids, I'm only
gonna give you 5 licks.

185
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,692
Grab a pole and let's get going.

186
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:30,778
I don't think so, creep!

187
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,238
Mom!

188
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,407
Carl, get in the house.

189
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,492
Get in the house!

190
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:40,997
And you...
Get the hell off my property.

191
00:19:41,664 --> 00:19:45,668
Sorry, ma'am. I was just escorting
your fine son home from school.

192
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:48,671
There's some ruffians
about and l...

193
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:52,883
Oh, Mitch and Carl,
we'll be seeing each other again.

194
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:04,937
I fuckin' saw that, you sack of shit!
You two are dead! Fuckin' dead!

195
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:09,025
Excuse me. Thank you.

196
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:14,613
Alright, you little freshman bitches!

197
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,532
Air raid!

198
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,745
That was pathetic!

199
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:26,751
Let's try it again. That means
get up, you lazy bitches! Get up!

200
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,254
Air raid!

201
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:36,177
That was horrible, you slut girls,
you freshman sluts! Get up!

202
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:37,678
Up!

203
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,015
Up! Up!... Air raid!

204
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:47,688
The entire community seems to be
supporting this, or turn their heads.

205
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:51,525
They have permission to use the
parking lot. No parents seem to mind.

206
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:54,653
They're selling concessions.
- I know.

207
00:20:55,404 --> 00:21:00,701
We seniors, we tried. We gave you
a chance, but since you prick teasers

208
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:02,912
can't follow instructions,

209
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:08,000
we're gonna have to try something
else, won't we? Seniors?

210
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:12,129
You love us. Smile!
You love us!

211
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,184
Suffer, sisters!

212
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:37,780
Eat it! Open wide!

213
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:46,497
Love it, girls!

214
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:52,795
Welcome to high school,
honey!

215
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:06,892
Propose to Mr. Dawson.

216
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,479
Will you marry me?

217
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,148
Don't know. What's in it for me?

218
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,735
Anything you want.
- Anything? - Anything.

219
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:18,863
Go like this.

220
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:22,241
Do you spit or swallow?

221
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,452
Whatever you like.

222
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,207
Whatever I like? I'd definitely marry
you. - That's so degrading.

223
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:34,336
You're an asshole.
- Yes, I am.

224
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:37,673
That's terrible, man. Horrible.

225
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:46,557
I feel for you. I did it when I was
a freshman, and you'll do it.

226
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:51,729
Now fry like bacon,
you little freshmen piggies!

227
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,776
Hi.
- Propose to Tony.

228
00:22:58,193 --> 00:22:59,570
Oh, God.

229
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,364
On your knees!

230
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,830
Will you marry me?

231
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:13,167
What am I supposed to say?
- I don't know.

232
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:16,920
What will you do for me?
- Anything you want.

233
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:22,009
Imagine the possibilities.
Seriously, you can stand up.

234
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:26,305
What's your name? - Sabrina.
- I'm Tony, Anthony actually.

235
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:28,015
Sorry.

236
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:29,767
This is Mike.

237
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:34,396
We're just discussing the utter
stupidity of these initiation rituals,

238
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,525
wondering why someone like you
would subject yourself to it.

239
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:43,822
What're we having? Social hour?
I'm a bitch. Back to the pit.

240
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:47,618
It's almost over.

241
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:52,331
Am I mistaken, or was there a little
thing going on with that vixen, stud?

242
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:56,668
You know how it is... - Bet she's
cute once you clean the shit off her.

243
00:23:57,127 --> 00:24:01,173
Okay, it's hot out here,
and I'm sick of looking at you.

244
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,219
So let's get outta here.
What you lookin' at?

245
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:10,474
Wipe that face off your head, bitch!
Get in the truck.

246
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,522
Maybe if you ever left
the poker table. - What about you?

247
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:20,150
The point is, that's why
we're going out tonight.

248
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:24,822
You might experience something more
tangible than an Abe Lincoln dream.

249
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:32,121
A hairline fracture! What did you do?
- Benny was wearin' their asses out!

250
00:24:32,996 --> 00:24:36,166
Just givin' 'em a little beatin'
they'll never forget.

251
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,335
"Here's to you, Ma!"

252
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:41,755
That's your fuckin' mother!

253
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:46,677
Say man, fuck the coaches. Do it
for us. - You pick this thing up?

254
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:50,806
Yeah. - What're you doin'?
- He ain't doin' shit.

255
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:56,854
Any more details of my life you can
let me in on, Ben? - Lots!

256
00:24:58,272 --> 00:25:00,107
O'Bannion, what're you doin'?

257
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:06,989
You didn't hear, did you?
I got a shotgun pulled on my ass.

258
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,825
Seniors are the best!

259
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:41,940
Hey, Mrs. Pickford.
- You here to see Kevin?

260
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:46,361
No, actually, we came to see you.
- Bet you're glad school's out.

261
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:50,908
Got our report cards today. - How did
you do? - Straight A's. - Both of you?

262
00:25:51,325 --> 00:25:56,371
Just kiddin'. - Big trip?
- For the weekend. - Takin' Kev?

263
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,958
No, he's staying here.
- Oh, he is?

264
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,628
Go on in. He's up there somewhere.

265
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:13,972
Let's get together sometime.
- Yeah, that'd be fun.

266
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:18,435
What do you do for fun?
- Just hang out with the girls.

267
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:23,523
Drive around. That kind of stuff.
There's a big party tonight.

268
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:29,029
Do you wanna come?
- Yeah? Cool.

269
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:34,409
You think it'd be all right? - Fine.
- Great. Pick you up at 8:30.

270
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,079
See you then.
- Okay, bye.

271
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:52,928
Sample of the goods.

272
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:56,181
15 bucks.

273
00:26:59,476 --> 00:27:04,773
Can you spot me ten?
I'll pay you like Tuesday.

274
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,239
Thank you.

275
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,910
Who is it?
- Kevin, you need to come out.

276
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:19,788
It reeks in here.

277
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:26,711
Kevin, there's someone out here
who needs to talk to you.

278
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:29,881
What about?
- Get the door, man! Here.

279
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,969
Slater, lose it!
- Kevin, open the door.

280
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:38,640
Dad, Mom.

281
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:43,145
What's up?
- Did you order kegs of beer? - No.

282
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:46,273
There's a fella on a beer truck
that says you did.

283
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,109
Oh, really? Just a sec.

284
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:00,453
That guy said I ordered a keg of beer?
- Yeah.

285
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:06,334
He said it's for the Pickford
residence. - This address? - Yeah.

286
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,755
Funny. Why don't I see what's
going on? - Think you better.

287
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:14,009
Be right back.

288
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,595
Know anything about a party here?

289
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,182
No, sir.

290
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:32,485
Hey, man.
Aren't you a bit early?

291
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:36,823
Yeah, about an hour and a half.

292
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,953
I got a little action happenin'...
- So you got the wrong house.

293
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:51,463
Yeah, inconvenience for you...
Wrong Mr. Pickford altogether!

294
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,549
These things happen.
Don't worry about it... Ben.

295
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:03,934
Were you going to have a party here?
- Don't know what that was about.

296
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:07,646
Start unpacking.
We're not goin' anywhere.

297
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,149
Fucker!

298
00:31:19,235 --> 00:31:20,820
Strike two!

299
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:22,864
Time!

300
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:27,869
Kramer, get this kid out,
or we're gonna beat your ass!

301
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:32,123
Let's go!
- Beat you like a runnin' mule!

302
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,878
Hey, man, forget about those guys.
Just get this last guy out.

303
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:41,049
Easy for your ass to say!
- There's nothin' you can do.

304
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,301
How'd they know I was gonna be here?

305
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:48,973
Quit stallin'! - Hope you got more
than a jock strap under there!

306
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,229
Because you're not gonna be able
to sit, don't let it affect you.

307
00:31:54,646 --> 00:32:00,693
Leave through the gate in right field.
That'll draw them out of here.

308
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,696
They're gonna get you anyway.

309
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,824
Yeah, get outta here.

310
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:11,037
What're you lookin' at?
Keep your head in the game!

311
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:29,847
Strike three!

312
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:50,827
Good game...

313
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:04,716
Good game!
- Way to go.

314
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:10,388
Come on.

315
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,265
Mitch!

316
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:16,894
What happened to your buds?
- Let's get this guy!

317
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,072
How's your dad doing?
- He's doing great.

318
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:35,204
This arm ready to throw 2,000 yards
next fall? - We'll see.

319
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:40,877
We're dependin' on you boys. Let me
tell you what. You're lookin' good.

320
00:33:41,711 --> 00:33:46,799
13 starters comin' back,
22 lettermen.

321
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:48,259
Yeah.

322
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:52,847
You folks take care.
- Good to see you, Randy.

323
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,802
Oh God, you know that hurts!
- What's goin' on here?

324
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:16,764
Pink, you missed it!
- Where are you headed to now?

325
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,434
The Emporium. Gonna join us?
- Yeah, see you up there.

326
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:23,896
You sign my paddle later.

327
00:35:24,313 --> 00:35:29,485
Gotta get seconds with him.
- You next, Pink. - Sure.

328
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:31,779
You already got him.

329
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:36,993
Fuck it. I'm gonna find your skinny
partner Carl and his mom.

330
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,623
I took it easy on you. You're not
smilin' now, you sack of shit.

331
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:50,006
Benny, Don!
- Bummer about Pickford's party.

332
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:55,594
His old man found out.
Total rip- off.

333
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:06,772
We got a few sixers. You with us?
- Yeah, gotta go home and change.

334
00:36:07,189 --> 00:36:12,611
Catch up with you. - See you later.
Kid, take care of that butt. Hold up!

335
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:19,660
You need a ride?

336
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,120
Yeah.

337
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:25,541
I think they left me.

338
00:36:28,043 --> 00:36:29,545
Here you go.

339
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:49,398
There's always one senior
who has to be the bad ass.

340
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:54,820
O'Bannion's gonna be the first senior
to take that honor 2 years in a row.

341
00:36:55,654 --> 00:36:58,157
The guy's a dick, right?

342
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,703
Yeah, he's kind of a joke.

343
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:07,500
He's not a bad guy
to have on your side.

344
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:13,255
Did you get it bad when you were
a freshman? - Shit, man!

345
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:20,054
They waited for my ass after baseball.
It was vicious.

346
00:37:21,722 --> 00:37:23,599
It's best to get a lot at once,

347
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:28,687
'cause after 10 licks, your ass is so
numb, it's best to get it over with.

348
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,192
I had some pretty cool seniors.

349
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:38,656
They'd take you out, bust the hell
outta you and get you drunk.

350
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:48,582
Thanks, man.
- Take care.

351
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,798
Since the party's not goin' on,

352
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:02,137
me and the other guys'll end up
ridin' around. Want us to pick you up?

353
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:05,975
Think that's a good idea?
- Yeah, sure, man.

354
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:10,521
The guys who haven't got you yet
will give you a few days to rest.

355
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:15,442
It'd be pretty cool to show up and
let 'em know it doesn't bother you.

356
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:20,572
Yeah, okay. Cool. - See ya later?
- Sure. Thanks for the ride.

357
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:22,491
Hey, man.

358
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:27,162
Put some ice on it. Won't be anything
a few beers can't take care of.

359
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:16,587
What did she say? I'm just interested.
What did she call me?

360
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:21,258
You hang out with her. You know it.
They talk about us. Just tell us.

361
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:27,598
Nothing. - Nothing? I know
you're lying, you bitch!

362
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:32,853
You're not gonna get mad. - I'm not.
- I don't care what she thinks.

363
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:37,191
She called you a bitch and you a slut.
- She called me a slut?

364
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,861
That bitch!
- Everybody calls you a slut!

365
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:45,491
That bitch! I'm gonna kick her ass.
What a bitch!

366
00:39:45,908 --> 00:39:48,577
You said you weren't gonna get mad.
- I'm not mad.

367
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:59,922
Look, I got a confession to make.
- What do you mean?

368
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:06,178
Well, y'know I've been talking about
going to law school, to help people?

369
00:40:06,595 --> 00:40:12,851
I was standing at the post office
and everybody's looking pathetic.

370
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:18,607
People got drool sorta... This guy's
bending over. You could see the crack.

371
00:40:19,024 --> 00:40:23,654
And I realized
that I don't want to do it.

372
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:29,076
Sounds good but I don't like the
people I was talking about helping.

373
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:34,331
I don't like people, period. You guys
are okay, but I'm a misanthrope.

374
00:40:34,748 --> 00:40:38,335
You're not goin' to law school?
What do you wanna do?

375
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:41,547
I wanna dance!

376
00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:49,846
Alright, let's rock and roll.

377
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,226
Hop in, man.

378
00:40:54,977 --> 00:40:56,687
Whose car?

379
00:40:57,104 --> 00:41:00,357
You know Wooderson?
- How's it goin'?

380
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:02,859
Pretty good. How's it goin' with you?

381
00:41:04,278 --> 00:41:07,281
Say man, you got a joint?

382
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,243
No, not on me.

383
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:15,956
It'd be a lot cooler if you did.

384
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:31,138
You drivin' into Houston to get
those Aerosmith tickets? - Damn right!

385
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,349
Evenin', ladies.
- Nice...

386
00:41:34,766 --> 00:41:38,353
Need me to pick up a couple?
- Yeah, two. - Cool.

387
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:46,611
You sure I'm okay in here? - If anyone
starts messin' with you, play it cool.

388
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:22,355
One to go.

389
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:23,815
Prickford!

390
00:42:24,357 --> 00:42:27,527
"Would- a- been" happenin'!
- Bummer about your party.

391
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:31,615
What can I say?
Delivery guy bricked.

392
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:34,367
He said: "Keep your eye on the ball."

393
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:39,790
How's it goin'? - What's goin' on?
- Nothin'... nothin' at all.

394
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:43,168
You know Mitch?
- I just heard about you.

395
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,588
What'd you hear?
- Don't know. Are you okay?

396
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:54,221
Guess I'll see you guys later.
- Okay.

397
00:43:05,857 --> 00:43:09,694
What grade's she in?
- Sophomore.

398
00:43:11,947 --> 00:43:13,782
We gotta hurry though.

399
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:18,787
Check this out, man. - Donny,
I got a big surprise for you.

400
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:23,291
Come on, let me make this shot!
Hold onto this! Tight!

401
00:43:31,716 --> 00:43:35,929
Gene! Nice tongue! Who painted 'em?
- Mostly Michelle.

402
00:43:38,348 --> 00:43:40,475
I got an idea.
- What?

403
00:43:41,142 --> 00:43:44,563
A beer bust later! - Pickford's
got a dube about to burn.

404
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,566
You with us?
- Think about it.

405
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:50,610
You cool, man?

406
00:43:52,737 --> 00:43:54,155
Like how?

407
00:44:01,997 --> 00:44:06,251
He was just askin' if you get high.
- Like smoke pot?

408
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,588
I never have before, but...

409
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,224
Where you goin'?

410
00:44:28,523 --> 00:44:30,317
Hi... No.

411
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,569
Crank it up!

412
00:44:59,471 --> 00:45:01,222
It's the chicks. Shavonne's still

413
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:04,559
mad at me. Watch me get something
going. Hey, what's goin' on?

414
00:45:04,976 --> 00:45:07,771
What're you up to?
- A little weed...

415
00:45:08,229 --> 00:45:12,275
Maybe a beer bust later on.
- Really? Cool!

416
00:45:12,692 --> 00:45:15,445
See you around.
- Check you later.

417
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:22,702
Slate, why're you such a dork?
- What? - "Check you later!"

418
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:26,081
Get off my case, man!

419
00:45:26,664 --> 00:45:30,377
Chicks don't wanna hear that shit.
- They don't wanna hear anything!

420
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:35,757
The girls in our classes are all
prudes. Worthless little bitches.

421
00:45:36,174 --> 00:45:39,302
The girls ahead of us were wild.
Our class is worthless.

422
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:43,765
Maybe you've never got past
the sniffin' - butt stage.

423
00:45:44,182 --> 00:45:47,268
It's quality, not quantity.

424
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:53,316
Wait till I get to college.
- All I'm gonna do is bang, bang...

425
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:23,304
Hirschfelder, let's go.
- Let's get outta here.

426
00:46:25,265 --> 00:46:27,016
Come on, man!

427
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:29,227
It's time to leave!

428
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:31,521
I'll be right back.

429
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:46,119
You leave, you can't come back.
- Aw, gee. You hear that?

430
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:50,290
If we leave, we can't come back.
- Oh no!

431
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,542
What should we do?

432
00:46:54,919 --> 00:47:00,216
What the hell? I was gettin' there.
I had my hand up her shirt.

433
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:05,346
You were gettin' there?
Hear that? He was getting there!

434
00:47:06,347 --> 00:47:10,268
You wouldn't know what to do,
so don't worry about it.

435
00:47:10,685 --> 00:47:14,397
Just 'cause you're striking out!
- That was our last junior high party.

436
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:19,611
We're in the big time now, where
all the girls will be puttin' out.

437
00:47:20,028 --> 00:47:24,198
Your days of pullin' tongue all night
are over. - Yeah, right!

438
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:46,846
You didn't know she stuffs her bra?
- Those were socks!

439
00:47:47,263 --> 00:47:49,349
They looked real to me.

440
00:47:52,894 --> 00:47:55,104
Shit!
- Scatter!

441
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:19,879
Where you runnin' to?
We ain't gonna hurt ya...much.

442
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:24,967
Hold onto that fence
and just squeal like a pig.

443
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:29,514
You ready to switch hit?
- Oh yeah. - I'm first.

444
00:48:39,357 --> 00:48:40,608
Bastards!

445
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:49,325
Hey, you guys.

446
00:48:50,952 --> 00:48:52,954
Take it easy on the kid.

447
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:56,374
Ladies...

448
00:49:01,546 --> 00:49:03,047
Who is that kid?

449
00:49:04,382 --> 00:49:08,553
Some kid we saw that shouldn't
have been at the rec center.

450
00:49:09,554 --> 00:49:10,888
Can we have some of those beers?

451
00:49:11,305 --> 00:49:14,809
One of these?
- Yeah. - Why?

452
00:49:15,226 --> 00:49:17,937
Just gimme a beer.
- Get outta here!

453
00:49:18,813 --> 00:49:20,022
Catch!

454
00:49:20,815 --> 00:49:23,401
Tubbs, catch! Get outta here.

455
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:26,863
What're you wastin' a beer on him for?
- What?

456
00:49:28,197 --> 00:49:32,034
Son of a bitch. - Give 'em a beer.
- This fuckin' sucks!

457
00:49:32,451 --> 00:49:36,247
Last fuckin' day of school.
No fuckin' party... nothin'!

458
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:40,126
Another fuckin' beer!
- Shut up!

459
00:49:48,009 --> 00:49:52,305
Which one of your friends the beer
this time? - Hey, fuck her. I did.

460
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:53,931
Bite me!

461
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:59,186
You wish, asshole!
- Fuck you! - Why're guys such pigs?

462
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:02,356
What?
- Let's get outta here.

463
00:50:02,773 --> 00:50:04,442
We're outta here.

464
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:07,737
Let me tell ya
what Melba Toast is packin'.

465
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:13,743
411 positrack out back,
750 double pumper, Edelbroc intakes,

466
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,248
11 to 1 pop- up pistons, Turbo- jet 390
horsepower... some fuckin' muscle!

467
00:50:19,665 --> 00:50:25,171
Man, you got this out of a comic book,
I saw the ad next to the sea monkeys.

468
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:31,010
See that? That's white lightning!
See the shoes on that thing?

469
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:37,683
Wow, such an expert.

470
00:50:38,184 --> 00:50:39,477
This is sad.

471
00:50:39,894 --> 00:50:42,438
Let's do something else.
- Like what?

472
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:47,568
I'm bored.
- Let's split. - Where you wanna go?

473
00:50:47,985 --> 00:50:53,324
Pink, hear anything about a beer bust?
- Talk to this man.

474
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:56,202
Patience, darling. Patience.

475
00:50:58,412 --> 00:51:02,500
What're you doing here?
- I was just about to ask you.

476
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:04,710
Heard you got busted.
- Yeah.

477
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:08,255
Hirschfelder, too.
- Really? - Yeah.

478
00:51:08,673 --> 00:51:10,925
Like how bad?
- Bad.

479
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:16,597
Was it O'Bannion?
- Yeah. God, I hate that jerk!

480
00:51:17,014 --> 00:51:18,432
I know.

481
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:23,771
What've you guys been doin'?

482
00:51:24,188 --> 00:51:27,191
Don't know.
Drivin' around mostly.

483
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:29,693
I didn't know Jodi was your sister.

484
00:51:31,237 --> 00:51:35,074
I hear my name over here? You talkin'
about me? Hey, kiddo.

485
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:38,411
Heard they got you
pretty bad.

486
00:51:38,828 --> 00:51:42,123
I asked them
to take it easy on you.

487
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,042
God, no wonder!

488
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:54,301
Where'd they find Hirsch?
- Walkin' outta the rec center...

489
00:52:13,612 --> 00:52:18,117
Face it. You couldn't get away.
- Try and outrun those guys!

490
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:22,830
I'm gonna laugh my ass off
when it's your turn!

491
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:26,542
Last year, they caught
10 freshmen at once.

492
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:31,797
O'Bannion backed over some pizzas
and made 'em eat it. - It's bullshit!

493
00:52:32,214 --> 00:52:37,428
Idiot flunks so he can be a dick
2 years in a row. Is that legal?

494
00:52:37,845 --> 00:52:39,430
Damn you, Carl!

495
00:52:45,811 --> 00:52:50,983
Okay, let me out. Slater,
you fuckin' hippie! Gimme drugs!

496
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,569
Get some from your mother!

497
00:52:53,986 --> 00:52:57,740
We just banged your mother!
- Fuck you!

498
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:03,078
Those guys! What's goin' on?
Haven't seen you in so long.

499
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:07,249
What's happenin'?
- Long time, no see.

500
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:10,586
What've you been up to?
- Same old shit.

501
00:53:11,003 --> 00:53:15,758
Workin' for the city. - Workin' man?
- Thinkin' about goin' back to school.

502
00:53:16,258 --> 00:53:18,761
Back to J.C.?
- Yeah, man.

503
00:53:19,553 --> 00:53:21,889
That's where the girls are.

504
00:53:22,306 --> 00:53:27,645
I'd just as soon keep workin'.
Keep a little change in my pocket.

505
00:53:28,062 --> 00:53:31,982
Rather than listenin' to some dipshit
who doesn't know what he's sayin'.

506
00:53:32,399 --> 00:53:34,568
I know what you're talkin' about.

507
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:38,906
So you're a freshman?
- Yeah.

508
00:53:39,323 --> 00:53:42,701
How's this year's crop
of freshman chicks lookin'?

509
00:53:43,118 --> 00:53:48,749
You're gonna end up in jail sometime
really soon. - No, man.

510
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:53,337
That's what I love
about these high school girls:

511
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:58,592
I get older, they stay
the same age. - Yes, they do.

512
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:00,427
Yes, they do.

513
00:54:00,844 --> 00:54:02,554
Wanna go for a spin?

514
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,306
Shotgun!

515
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:08,936
Woods.
- I'm here, man.

516
00:54:09,478 --> 00:54:13,023
You gonna come along?
- Yeah, why not?

517
00:54:14,316 --> 00:54:16,068
You boys have fun.

518
00:54:16,485 --> 00:54:22,658
I'm gonna give you shotgun,
but only 'cause I'm goin' inside.

519
00:54:23,075 --> 00:54:25,452
Keep that in mind.

520
00:54:30,249 --> 00:54:33,335
Whose bowling ball is this?
- It's yours.

521
00:54:33,752 --> 00:54:37,297
What's happenin'? Play a little
foosball? - Yeah. - Alright.

522
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:06,201
Pull over.

523
00:55:06,618 --> 00:55:09,079
Pull over to the trash can.

524
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:33,979
Pull over there.

525
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:05,719
Bowling ball.
Throw the bowling ball.

526
00:56:06,637 --> 00:56:07,804
Think I should?

527
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,182
Throw it!

528
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:13,435
You're playin' with the big boys now.

529
00:56:13,852 --> 00:56:17,648
Faggot sissy- pussy freshman,
throw it! - Heave it!

530
00:56:24,905 --> 00:56:28,742
Fuck 'em!
- That bowling ball said "Oof!"

531
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:31,078
to that windshield!

532
00:56:32,537 --> 00:56:35,290
You're nuts, Junior!

533
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:40,712
We're outta beer.
We gotta make a grab- 'n' - go stop.

534
00:56:41,129 --> 00:56:44,841
I don't have any money. - Who's got
money? - I gave... - Where's yours?

535
00:56:45,258 --> 00:56:47,970
Doesn't matter. Head out that way.

536
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:56,728
You gonna hoist it? - Yeah.
I need the freshman as a lookout.

537
00:56:57,145 --> 00:57:01,608
I don't wanna get in trouble. Do you,
Pink? - I don't know about this, Don.

538
00:57:06,697 --> 00:57:09,241
Be careful, Junior!

539
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,370
Sunflower seeds.
- Zigzags.

540
00:57:13,787 --> 00:57:16,248
I'm not sure about this.

541
00:57:16,665 --> 00:57:20,210
I'm gonna pay for it.
I'm just messin' around with 'em.

542
00:57:20,627 --> 00:57:21,670
Good.

543
00:57:38,437 --> 00:57:40,230
Run! Go!

544
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:49,448
Don't try anything, or
I'll shoot the shit outta you!

545
00:57:50,323 --> 00:57:53,326
Give the beer back, man.
- I paid for the beer.

546
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:56,872
You busted my mailbox.

547
00:57:58,206 --> 00:57:59,958
Look me in the eye, punk!

548
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:04,421
Don't know what you're talking about,
but... - You busted it!

549
00:58:08,967 --> 00:58:11,803
Tamperin' with mailboxes
is a felony offense.

550
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:18,602
I done called the police.
You oughta get outta the car.

551
00:58:19,144 --> 00:58:20,604
Just go, man!

552
00:58:21,062 --> 00:58:22,189
Nice and slow...

553
00:58:38,872 --> 00:58:41,041
Fairly uneventful, huh?

554
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:47,756
Which one of you had the theory
about how President Ford's football

555
00:58:48,173 --> 00:58:51,635
injury is affecting the economy?
- Ford's on the Warren Commission.

556
00:58:52,052 --> 00:58:57,182
He's outta there this fall.
We need alcohol. - That's a thought.

557
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:29,047
Run out to the Centennial and
pick me up a sixer of this stuff.

558
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:31,508
Think you can do that?

559
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:36,137
Thanks.
- Good luck!

560
00:59:37,264 --> 00:59:40,725
If we're gonna drive around,
we should just do somethin'.

561
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:46,231
You're right, man. I'm gonna get
drunk, maybe get laid

562
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:50,652
or get in a fight.
- We should be up for anything!

563
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:54,572
We are, but what?
Don't you ever feel

564
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:58,827
like everything we do
is just to service the future?

565
00:59:59,244 --> 01:00:02,205
It's like it's all preparation.

566
01:00:02,622 --> 01:00:04,082
But what for?

567
01:00:04,499 --> 01:00:06,710
Death.
- Life of the party!

568
01:00:07,127 --> 01:00:10,088
It's true.
- But y'know, that's valid.

569
01:00:10,505 --> 01:00:14,801
If we're all gonna die, shouldn't we
be enjoying ourselves now?

570
01:00:15,218 --> 01:00:22,183
I'd like to quit thinking the present
is some minor preamble. - Exactly.

571
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,230
Everybody in this car needs
some good old visceral experience.

572
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:31,276
Remember, eat a green thing every day.

573
01:00:31,693 --> 01:00:36,489
And lots of calcium. It's important
for young mothers to have calcium.

574
01:00:36,906 --> 01:00:40,076
Here you are.
- See you tomorrow.

575
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:44,080
How are you this evening?
- Pretty good. How's it goin'?

576
01:00:44,497 --> 01:00:46,791
A lot better when I get off.

577
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:49,043
Yeah, I hear that.

578
01:00:53,173 --> 01:00:59,137
You're 18, right? - Oh, yeah.
Just graduated. - Congratulations.

579
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:01,723
Off to college in the fall?

580
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:06,561
I'm still not sure.
I'm workin' now. For the city.

581
01:01:07,061 --> 01:01:11,149
Thinkin' of holdin' on to the job
for a while. It's money in my pocket.

582
01:01:11,566 --> 01:01:14,027
I hear that. Here's some more.

583
01:01:14,444 --> 01:01:17,280
Have a nice night.
- Thanks.

584
01:01:17,697 --> 01:01:19,824
Take it easy.

585
01:01:26,122 --> 01:01:28,124
There you guys are!

586
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:29,959
What's in the bag?

587
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:32,921
Sixer. You owe me one, man!

588
01:01:33,338 --> 01:01:38,343
They busted Hirschfelder, too.
- I heard. - You over at the Emporium?

589
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:42,222
Is that bastard O'Bannion there?

590
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:45,183
Yes. I hate that jerk.

591
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:51,064
You guys wanna get him back?
- Yeah.

592
01:01:59,906 --> 01:02:03,535
They really sold it to you?
- Of course. - Cool!

593
01:02:08,957 --> 01:02:10,875
There ya go, buddy.

594
01:02:11,668 --> 01:02:13,378
Paycheck.
- Oh yeah.

595
01:02:13,795 --> 01:02:15,463
Nice shooting.
- Thanks.

596
01:02:18,091 --> 01:02:20,051
What we got here?

597
01:02:20,468 --> 01:02:24,973
I got your change.
- Don't worry. A beer for my partner.

598
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:27,225
Want a beer?
- Yeah. - Alright.

599
01:02:27,642 --> 01:02:32,397
Guys, party at the moon tower.
You and Benny pick up the first keg.

600
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:37,735
I'm going to collect for the rest.
Spread the word. At the moon tower!

601
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:40,738
Good game, man. You too.

602
01:02:41,155 --> 01:02:46,536
Y'all an embarrassment to the sport.
You should be proud I let you play.

603
01:02:46,953 --> 01:02:52,625
You are the worst pool player. Keep
watching. You might learn something.

604
01:02:53,376 --> 01:02:58,381
You got so many balls on the table
I have to get 'em outta the way!

605
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:00,133
Corner pocket.

606
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:03,928
God, you are terrible!

607
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:09,892
Homo, I hope you're ready to taste
the bitter humiliation of defeat.

608
01:03:12,312 --> 01:03:17,191
They're busting Carl Burnett out back.
- What did you say?

609
01:03:17,608 --> 01:03:19,986
He's gettin' busted.

610
01:03:20,445 --> 01:03:23,322
Benny, they got Burnett out back.
- Carl Burnett?

611
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:28,745
Come on! - Let me finish this game.
You hold him for me!

612
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:36,794
Hey, man. That Julie chick
loves you. Oh yeah. You want her?

613
01:03:37,211 --> 01:03:42,258
Play it cool. Can't let her know you
like her. She'll dump you like that.

614
01:03:42,675 --> 01:03:47,096
If she asks you to ride with her,
say, "Nah, got my own ride,

615
01:03:47,513 --> 01:03:51,517
but maybe I'll see you later."
Sounds stupid but it works.

616
01:03:53,561 --> 01:03:58,316
We got another one. You wouldn't mind
if I went first, would ya?

617
01:03:58,733 --> 01:04:03,696
Alright? It's a personal thing between
me and this piece of shit.

618
01:04:04,405 --> 01:04:07,909
So... we meet again, huh?

619
01:04:08,326 --> 01:04:12,497
This motherfucker's mom pulled
a shotgun on me this afternoon.

620
01:04:12,914 --> 01:04:14,207
Fuckin' bitch.

621
01:04:14,624 --> 01:04:19,003
Haven't had any licks yet?
- No.

622
01:04:19,962 --> 01:04:25,593
Another cherry, boys.
Get the fuck against the wall!

623
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:30,223
You have to be the dumbest
freshman cocksucker out tonight!

624
01:04:30,807 --> 01:04:35,603
You knew I was gonna find you!
I dedicate this first lick

625
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,647
to your mother.

626
01:04:38,147 --> 01:04:39,482
Fucker!

627
01:04:43,653 --> 01:04:44,695
Not yet.

628
01:04:45,863 --> 01:04:47,448
It's gettin' warmer.

629
01:04:47,865 --> 01:04:48,908
What the fuck?

630
01:04:53,454 --> 01:04:56,249
Remember me, you pig?

631
01:05:10,263 --> 01:05:11,847
Hurry, man!

632
01:05:12,265 --> 01:05:16,519
It was beautiful! You should've seen
the look on that fuck's face!

633
01:05:21,899 --> 01:05:26,946
You let that little fuck get away!
What's the matter with you? Pitiful!

634
01:05:28,447 --> 01:05:31,909
Fuck!
Freshman shitheads!

635
01:05:32,326 --> 01:05:34,287
What the fuck are you lookin' at?

636
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:36,872
Kick your fuckin' ass right now!

637
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:39,750
Pussy!

638
01:05:45,881 --> 01:05:48,676
What're you smilin' at?
Freshman faggot!

639
01:05:50,886 --> 01:05:52,179
Fuck you.

640
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,599
Fuck all of you!

641
01:05:58,352 --> 01:05:59,979
Goddamn it!

642
01:06:23,544 --> 01:06:28,466
I swore I'd never go to a Top Notch.
And I am sorting through jalapeno

643
01:06:28,883 --> 01:06:32,011
burgers and soggy fries. Take 'em.

644
01:06:34,513 --> 01:06:35,639
Oh Christ!

645
01:06:36,932 --> 01:06:38,434
How ya doin'?

646
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:41,312
Pretty good.

647
01:06:42,021 --> 01:06:46,400
Cool. Heard about the party
being busted? - Oh yeah.

648
01:06:46,817 --> 01:06:52,531
Not to worry. There's a new fiesta
in the making. At the moon tower.

649
01:06:52,948 --> 01:06:56,869
Full kegs, everybody's gonna be there.
You oughta go.

650
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,414
Okay.
- We'll be there.

651
01:07:00,873 --> 01:07:02,333
So ya need a ride?

652
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,211
I got my own car. Thanks.

653
01:07:05,628 --> 01:07:10,966
Ditch the two geeks and get in
with us, but that's all right.

654
01:07:11,884 --> 01:07:12,968
I'll see you there.

655
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:19,850
I love those redheads, man.
- I know you.

656
01:07:20,476 --> 01:07:23,020
We had geography together.

657
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:30,444
Oh God!
- What a dick. - That was so creepy!

658
01:07:30,861 --> 01:07:35,574
Why're you smilin'?
- I thought he was cute. - Cute?

659
01:07:35,991 --> 01:07:41,372
When he graduated we were 3.
Cynthia, what're you thinking?

660
01:07:42,957 --> 01:07:44,750
I don't know.

661
01:07:46,585 --> 01:07:49,755
We gonna still go?
- Huh? - Yeah.

662
01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:21,453
You better have your wood screws. I'm
gonna blow your doors off! - Fuck you!

663
01:09:36,028 --> 01:09:38,822
Someone's tokin' some reefer.

664
01:09:42,951 --> 01:09:47,289
Hey, man, slow down. What's up?
- How's it going? - What'd you say?

665
01:09:47,873 --> 01:09:48,957
When?

666
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:52,544
Just now, when you walked past.

667
01:09:53,003 --> 01:09:54,171
About what?

668
01:09:55,214 --> 01:09:57,800
You said,
"Someone's tokin' some reefer '."

669
01:09:58,842 --> 01:10:01,762
It was just an observation.

670
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:06,642
Oh, an observation? And who the hell
are you? Isaac fuckin' Newton?

671
01:10:07,059 --> 01:10:09,812
I'm the one smokin' marijuana, fucker!

672
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:13,690
You got a problem with that?
- No. - Why'd you say that?

673
01:10:14,274 --> 01:10:17,069
Don't let your mouth write a check
your butt can't cash.

674
01:10:17,486 --> 01:10:21,740
So I'm blazin' with my friends, I'm a
fuckin' pothead. What's it to you?

675
01:10:22,157 --> 01:10:26,036
Outta observations? Observe while
I punch your teeth down your throat!

676
01:10:26,453 --> 01:10:30,916
Come on, dude. Relax.
- I'll be watchin' you, Newton!

677
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:35,963
I only came here to do 2 things:
Kick ass and drink some beer.

678
01:10:36,463 --> 01:10:38,674
Looks like we're almost outta beer.

679
01:10:39,174 --> 01:10:41,343
You okay, man?

680
01:10:48,142 --> 01:10:50,018
Why's it called the moon tower?

681
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:55,274
They put it up when they were
buildin' the power plant.

682
01:10:55,691 --> 01:11:00,362
Actually, it's a good idea. You got
a full moon out here every day.

683
01:11:01,363 --> 01:11:05,492
But nothing's ever been repaired.
This whole place could fall down.

684
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:08,745
So you better
watch your step, Junior.

685
01:11:10,038 --> 01:11:14,376
This place used to be off - limits,
'cause some drunk freshman fell off.

686
01:11:14,793 --> 01:11:18,297
He went right down the middle,
smackin' his head on every beam.

687
01:11:18,714 --> 01:11:24,094
Doesn't hurt after the first couple.
Autopsy said he had 1 beer. You?

688
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:28,599
Four.
- You're dead. You're so dead.

689
01:11:30,392 --> 01:11:34,062
Look at the bloodstains.
- Shut up.

690
01:11:36,148 --> 01:11:40,944
I'm gonna get that guy. - What guy?
- That asshole on the way in. Clint.

691
01:11:41,445 --> 01:11:46,450
That super dominant male greaser.
- I wouldn't suggest that, Mike.

692
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:51,747
I got it all planned. Most fights
never get past a punch or two.

693
01:11:52,164 --> 01:11:55,917
An instinct not to upset the herd.
I gotta get in one good punch,

694
01:11:56,335 --> 01:12:00,839
play defense and wait.
- What? - What're you talking about?

695
01:12:01,256 --> 01:12:06,053
At first, I was relieved to get out,
but now there's this humiliation

696
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:10,557
that's gonna be with me forever.
I'm not gonna let this

697
01:12:10,974 --> 01:12:15,395
contribute to me being an ineffectual
nothing the rest of my life.

698
01:12:17,773 --> 01:12:22,069
Look at this fuckin' town!
It's dead!

699
01:12:25,656 --> 01:12:29,493
Imagine how many people
out there now are fuckin'!

700
01:12:32,663 --> 01:12:34,790
Just going at it.

701
01:12:41,088 --> 01:12:44,966
Remember me?
- Sure. Sabrina, right? - Right.

702
01:12:45,384 --> 01:12:49,096
How ya doin'?
- Let's go. - What brings you here?

703
01:12:49,513 --> 01:12:51,640
Just hanging out.

704
01:12:54,184 --> 01:12:56,645
You havin' fun?
- Yeah.

705
01:12:58,563 --> 01:13:01,942
Does your offer still stand?

706
01:13:03,819 --> 01:13:07,864
What am I supposed to say?
Anything you want.

707
01:13:16,623 --> 01:13:20,836
Why'd we even come here?
I always feel out of place.

708
01:13:21,253 --> 01:13:24,089
You're tellin' me!
I'm being stalked by a Nazi.

709
01:13:24,631 --> 01:13:26,383
That reefer I smell on you?

710
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,638
Coach is right. You're runnin' with
that bad crowd. Attitude adjustment!

711
01:13:32,055 --> 01:13:35,600
Am I the only athlete at this party,
you two drunks?

712
01:13:36,017 --> 01:13:41,231
Coach is right. Those guys don't care
if we win or lose.

713
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:44,359
Check this out. Watch this.

714
01:13:45,485 --> 01:13:46,653
Watch me...

715
01:13:48,113 --> 01:13:51,032
Oh no, it's the cops! Look!

716
01:13:52,492 --> 01:13:53,577
It was so easy!

717
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:57,455
Oh, shit. He needs another drink.

718
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:40,290
Hey, Mitch!

719
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,877
How's it goin'?
- Wonderin' if you were around.

720
01:14:49,299 --> 01:14:54,137
Just wanted to talk.
Are you quittin' football?

721
01:14:55,931 --> 01:15:00,310
Or you don't wanna sign the pledge?
That's what it is.

722
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,688
I don't know.

723
01:15:04,356 --> 01:15:07,359
Maybe I'm not into it anymore.

724
01:15:08,693 --> 01:15:11,112
"You're not into any of it"?

725
01:15:12,947 --> 01:15:16,993
The biggest mistake of your life.
No one quits senior year.

726
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:22,624
Especially if you're starting
quarterback. We got a shot at state.

727
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,461
We'll kick some butt this year.

728
01:15:27,045 --> 01:15:30,340
It's what we've been working for
all our lives.

729
01:15:30,757 --> 01:15:33,093
Me and you wanna be champions!

730
01:15:33,885 --> 01:15:34,928
All I'm sayin' is

731
01:15:35,929 --> 01:15:42,394
if I do play next year, it's gonna be
on my terms, not theirs.

732
01:15:43,103 --> 01:15:49,818
Remember, Pink. It ain't just about
you. It's about us: me, Donny, Mel.

733
01:15:50,235 --> 01:15:54,155
You'll be fuckin' us over!
Or maybe you're just scared.

734
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:58,159
Have a nice night.

735
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:32,277
Watch them fly...

736
01:16:36,614 --> 01:16:38,700
... away.

737
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:44,831
You know what that song's about?

738
01:16:45,248 --> 01:16:46,916
It's about aliens.

739
01:16:48,459 --> 01:16:54,424
We're the aliens. We're the savages.
- That song's about that?

740
01:16:54,841 --> 01:16:57,302
Yeah, that song's about that.
- About aliens?

741
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:03,600
Yeah! This country was founded by
people who were into aliens.

742
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:09,314
George Washington was in a cult
that was into aliens. You didn't know?

743
01:17:09,731 --> 01:17:13,359
No...
- They were way into that stuff!

744
01:17:13,776 --> 01:17:17,280
The every- other - decade theory:
The 50s were boring,

745
01:17:17,697 --> 01:17:22,827
the 60s rocked,
and the 70s obviously sucked.

746
01:17:23,995 --> 01:17:26,497
Maybe the 80s will be radical.

747
01:17:26,915 --> 01:17:30,501
We'll be in our 20s,
and it can't get any worse.

748
01:17:48,645 --> 01:17:53,858
Wait a minute! Who put the keg
in the woods? - I don't know.

749
01:17:54,275 --> 01:17:57,779
This is where they told me
it would be. - Oh yeah?

750
01:17:58,237 --> 01:18:00,865
I don't think we need beer anyway.

751
01:18:03,618 --> 01:18:06,955
George toked weed. - Absolutely!
Are you kiddin' me?

752
01:18:07,372 --> 01:18:12,794
He grew fields of that stuff.
- Up in Mount Vernon.

753
01:18:13,211 --> 01:18:15,171
All over the country.

754
01:18:15,588 --> 01:18:20,301
He had people growin' it all over.
The whole country was getting high.

755
01:18:20,718 --> 01:18:24,305
'cause he knew
he was onto something.

756
01:18:24,722 --> 01:18:30,103
He knew it'd be a good cash crop for
the southern states. So he grew it.

757
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:36,317
Behind every good man, there's a
woman. That was Martha Washington.

758
01:18:36,734 --> 01:18:41,864
She'd have a big bowl
waiting for him when he'd come in.

759
01:18:42,281 --> 01:18:44,909
She was a hip, a hip lady, man.

760
01:19:00,925 --> 01:19:03,761
Wait.
- What? - What're you doin'?

761
01:19:05,596 --> 01:19:08,182
Don't you have a girlfriend?

762
01:19:09,726 --> 01:19:12,687
What girlfriend?
- What's her name?

763
01:19:13,104 --> 01:19:14,897
Simone?

764
01:19:21,112 --> 01:19:24,991
She was real cool, too.
She'd harvest the crops.

765
01:19:25,408 --> 01:19:31,289
She'd put it in bushels and sell it
to make ends meet.

766
01:19:31,706 --> 01:19:36,752
Ever look at a dollar bill?
There's some spooky stuff going on.

767
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:38,796
It's green, too!

768
01:19:39,505 --> 01:19:41,382
Later.
- See you.

769
01:19:41,799 --> 01:19:46,471
What was that? - What were you doin'?
- What you wish you were doin'.

770
01:19:46,888 --> 01:19:48,890
Look at your boy.
- Look at your boy.

771
01:19:49,307 --> 01:19:50,349
Kramer!

772
01:19:51,893 --> 01:19:55,480
Yeah, you, freshman!
Right here, buddy!

773
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:59,192
He waves at us.
- What is this wave shit?

774
01:19:59,817 --> 01:20:00,860
Over here.

775
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:02,778
Now!

776
01:20:03,446 --> 01:20:04,489
Come on.

777
01:20:05,281 --> 01:20:08,868
Shit, I should go.
- I guess you should.

778
01:20:09,285 --> 01:20:11,704
I'll be back.

779
01:20:12,997 --> 01:20:17,877
He's like Casanova. Amazing!
- Look at that shit- eatin' grin.

780
01:20:18,294 --> 01:20:24,050
Not bad for a freshman, but watch out
for them older girls. - Hey,

781
01:20:26,302 --> 01:20:32,099
we wanna know something: Gonna
fuck that, or are you a wimp?

782
01:20:32,516 --> 01:20:35,311
How do you know
I haven't already?

783
01:20:35,728 --> 01:20:39,482
Get outta here.
It's past your bedtime! Run along!

784
01:20:41,651 --> 01:20:45,029
Go get a ride with her.
Say we left.

785
01:20:45,446 --> 01:20:47,823
It will work.

786
01:20:48,282 --> 01:20:50,618
Kramer, show it to her!

787
01:21:00,962 --> 01:21:02,672
Air raid, freshman.

788
01:21:03,422 --> 01:21:04,465
What?

789
01:21:04,924 --> 01:21:06,676
Air raid, freshman.

790
01:21:07,093 --> 01:21:11,514
Darla... - This is between
me and her. She better be

791
01:21:11,931 --> 01:21:13,516
on the ground in 5 seconds!

792
01:21:15,768 --> 01:21:19,021
She doesn't have to air raid,
'cause she's with me, okay.

793
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:22,733
Air raid, or it's your ass!

794
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,986
Don't do it, Sabrina.

795
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:26,862
Oh, that's it.

796
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,240
Miss Hot Stuff.

797
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:36,163
I'm going to make the next year
of your life a living hell.

798
01:21:43,129 --> 01:21:45,506
Lick me, all of you!

799
01:21:48,384 --> 01:21:49,635
Good for you.

800
01:21:51,345 --> 01:21:56,642
Don't air raid for that bitch.
It's like that Clint fucker.

801
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:59,061
Hey, motherfucker!
- Alright, okay, Mike.

802
01:21:59,478 --> 01:22:01,439
Dominant male monkey motherfucker!

803
01:22:05,234 --> 01:22:09,822
Tara. - I never met a "Tara" before.
You're my first.

804
01:22:15,786 --> 01:22:17,079
He did it. I can't believe it!

805
01:22:17,997 --> 01:22:20,958
I fuckin' knew I should've
kicked your ass. Come on!

806
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:31,051
You guys, that's Mike.
- It's Clint. - That crazy bastard.

807
01:22:42,146 --> 01:22:44,523
You like this, motherfucker?

808
01:22:55,868 --> 01:22:58,787
You're fuckin' dead, faschist!

809
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:03,959
You're dead!

810
01:23:34,365 --> 01:23:36,283
Hey, little brother.

811
01:23:37,576 --> 01:23:40,329
That a beer?
- Yes, it is.

812
01:23:40,746 --> 01:23:45,125
You had more than one?
- A few. Nobody's counting.

813
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:47,711
Hey, how ya doin'?

814
01:23:48,837 --> 01:23:52,675
I should get used to you being
at the same social functions as me.

815
01:23:53,092 --> 01:23:56,512
And hanging out
with people I know.

816
01:23:56,929 --> 01:24:01,642
What time are you supposed to be home?
- I don't know. Couple of hours ago.

817
01:24:02,935 --> 01:24:06,397
Bullshit!
That's major bullshit.

818
01:24:06,814 --> 01:24:11,360
Mom barely let me outta the house
when I was your age.

819
01:24:11,777 --> 01:24:16,740
Don't think she's not gonna be
waiting up. I've been through it.

820
01:24:17,157 --> 01:24:22,663
And she's tough. - Just don't ask her
to take it easy on me, please.

821
01:24:23,789 --> 01:24:27,501
What's that supposed to mean?
Take it easy on him?

822
01:24:27,918 --> 01:24:31,213
Let's go smoke that joint.
- He's in for a surprise.

823
01:24:50,691 --> 01:24:51,734
Alright!

824
01:24:54,528 --> 01:24:57,698
Thanks a lot, man.
- No worries. Take care.

825
01:24:58,115 --> 01:25:01,035
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 4.
- Okay.

826
01:25:02,661 --> 01:25:07,750
Aerosmith, 3 weeks, front- row seats.
- Alright. I won't forget.

827
01:25:10,419 --> 01:25:14,631
Who's buying breakfast?
- Not me. - I will, I guess.

828
01:25:15,048 --> 01:25:19,261
You comin' along? - Sure.
- Night, John Boy, Ali.

829
01:25:21,555 --> 01:25:25,809
"Would- a- been!"
- Pink, what's happenin'?

830
01:25:26,602 --> 01:25:30,898
Cynthia, man. I like it, man.
- Red's a good color for you.

831
01:25:31,315 --> 01:25:32,483
My favorite color.

832
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:37,070
Have you seen Jodi around?
- She left your ass. - Really?

833
01:25:37,488 --> 01:25:40,240
Ya win some, ya lose some.

834
01:25:43,744 --> 01:25:48,165
Slater, you look good.
- What's goin' on? - What's goin' on?

835
01:25:48,582 --> 01:25:51,835
Nothing.
- What time is it?

836
01:25:52,753 --> 01:25:58,342
Let's go smoke a joint on the
50- yard line, to honor Coach Conrad!

837
01:25:59,343 --> 01:26:01,094
We're there.
- Great idea.

838
01:26:02,012 --> 01:26:05,807
Man with the plan!
- Wanna come with me? - Okay.

839
01:26:08,393 --> 01:26:12,439
Joint subcommittee meeting
on the 50- yard line in 15.

840
01:26:12,856 --> 01:26:17,611
Don, y'all ride with me. Let's hit it!
- This is cashed, man!

841
01:26:18,028 --> 01:26:23,325
Cashed! Ride with us, but in the back,
'cause I gotta shotgun you.

842
01:26:25,702 --> 01:26:28,288
Watch the leather.

843
01:26:34,294 --> 01:26:40,884
Don't you quit. You wanna hit him?
- Jesus, you're wearin' Rebel gray.

844
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:46,014
Now break down!
Break down!

845
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:51,728
You don't deserve to wear
that Rebel gray!

846
01:26:52,145 --> 01:26:56,316
You won't hit him?
"Only the strong survive!"

847
01:26:56,733 --> 01:26:59,736
That's it! Only the strong survive!

848
01:27:00,654 --> 01:27:03,573
Where's your pitch?
Hit your goddamn pitch!

849
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:15,585
My grandmother can hit harder!

850
01:27:16,003 --> 01:27:17,921
What the fuck, man?

851
01:27:18,338 --> 01:27:23,385
She's a 8'4", 652 - pound hairy- ass
gorilla and runs a 40 in 10.2.

852
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:28,098
She's gotten bigger. She was
only 6'2", 195 in my day.

853
01:27:28,515 --> 01:27:32,311
Still drivin' that Mack truck, though.
- Pink, you got my papers?

854
01:27:32,728 --> 01:27:34,396
In my glove compartment.

855
01:27:34,813 --> 01:27:39,484
I got 'em. Hit me on the slant.
Gimme the keys to an inside.

856
01:27:40,402 --> 01:27:44,906
Marijuana on one.
- Reefer on two.

857
01:27:58,587 --> 01:28:03,842
Looks pretty good, huh? - Yeah.
- Could be a little more symmetrical.

858
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:09,097
Does that hurt? Sorry.
- It's a bruise.

859
01:28:10,057 --> 01:28:12,726
I don't know.
Let me ask you something.

860
01:28:13,143 --> 01:28:18,023
I got some pretty good ones in there.
You wouldn't say I got my ass kicked.

861
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:23,570
After a couple of years people won't
remember if you won or lost.

862
01:28:23,987 --> 01:28:28,450
You're right, 'cause I read about
a Jackson Pollock

863
01:28:28,867 --> 01:28:33,330
or Ernest Hemingway. You never read
who won or lost a brawl.

864
01:28:33,747 --> 01:28:37,918
Thanks for the ride
and breakfast. - No problem.

865
01:28:38,335 --> 01:28:43,757
Nice to pile on some pancakes
and syrup after a night of beer.

866
01:28:58,271 --> 01:28:59,397
Good night.

867
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:21,920
Hope you're not grounded
or anything. - Thanks.

868
01:29:24,339 --> 01:29:30,345
"... not to indulge in drugs, alcohol
sex, or any other illegal activity."

869
01:29:32,097 --> 01:29:34,849
Slater, babe.
Found that in your glove compartment.

870
01:29:35,684 --> 01:29:38,728
You're the third person
who's given me this.

871
01:29:39,771 --> 01:29:41,940
What you gonna do?

872
01:29:42,357 --> 01:29:45,277
I don't know.
Probably end up signin'.

873
01:29:45,694 --> 01:29:48,613
It's the same bullshit
they tried to pull in my day.

874
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:53,577
If it ain't that, it's some other
choice they're gonna make for you.

875
01:29:53,994 --> 01:29:58,707
You gotta do what Randall "Pink" Floyd
wants to do. Let me tell ya this:

876
01:29:59,124 --> 01:30:03,003
The older you get, the more rules they
are gonna try to get you to follow.

877
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:06,965
You just gotta keep livin', man.
L - I - V - I - N!

878
01:30:09,092 --> 01:30:13,179
If you sign that, you should throw
a little grass in the middle.

879
01:30:13,597 --> 01:30:18,476
Roll it up, sign the joint, man.
Tell 'em! - That's what I'll do.

880
01:30:18,893 --> 01:30:24,691
Assholes. - A bunch of assholes, but
we've had good times here, Pink.

881
01:30:25,108 --> 01:30:29,487
Yeah, I can't believe this.
You act like you're so oppressed.

882
01:30:29,904 --> 01:30:34,326
You guys are kings of the school!
You get away with whatever you want.

883
01:30:34,743 --> 01:30:39,080
If I ever start referring to these as
the best years of my life,

884
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:42,125
remind me to kill myself.

885
01:30:42,542 --> 01:30:46,254
All I'm sayin' is
I just wanna look back and say:

886
01:30:46,671 --> 01:30:50,717
I did it the best I could
while stuck in this place,

887
01:30:51,134 --> 01:30:54,554
had as much fun as I could
while stuck in this place,

888
01:30:54,971 --> 01:30:58,099
played as hard as I could
while stuck in this place,

889
01:30:58,516 --> 01:31:03,063
dogged as many chicks as I could
while stuck in this place.

890
01:31:04,022 --> 01:31:07,400
Right, Mr. Premature Ejaculation!

891
01:31:15,617 --> 01:31:16,868
That the cops?
- What...?

892
01:31:18,369 --> 01:31:21,039
All of you! Get over here!

893
01:31:21,456 --> 01:31:26,377
Now! - Ditch that pot! Is it illegal
to be on the football field?

894
01:31:30,965 --> 01:31:35,136
Come on, Slater. - What'd we do?
- Got any Visine?

895
01:31:36,262 --> 01:31:38,640
I can't believe this.

896
01:31:39,307 --> 01:31:43,228
If it ain't Richard Wrath!
How ya doin', Dick?

897
01:31:43,645 --> 01:31:47,398
Well, well,
a couple of football players!

898
01:31:49,484 --> 01:31:53,071
Wonder what Coach is gonna think.
Line up.

899
01:31:56,282 --> 01:32:00,870
Wooderson? - Slavey? - Reliving
old glories on the football field?

900
01:32:02,705 --> 01:32:07,752
Get through! You shouldn't be mad that
I got All- District and you didn't.

901
01:32:41,953 --> 01:32:44,122
Get your
scrawny butts over here!

902
01:32:48,126 --> 01:32:49,252
Mornin', Coach!

903
01:32:51,212 --> 01:32:55,049
Why am I gettin' wake- up calls
from the cops?

904
01:32:55,466 --> 01:33:00,096
They just left.
- False alarm. - Come here, Randy.

905
01:33:03,099 --> 01:33:05,059
You been out with those losers?

906
01:33:05,476 --> 01:33:09,731
Hey, Coach Conrad, remember me?
Second- period gym class?

907
01:33:11,524 --> 01:33:15,612
That's the kind of people I mean.
Trouble means nothing to that bunch.

908
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:17,697
You're the one with something to lose.

909
01:33:18,948 --> 01:33:23,369
You don't even know them.
How can you talk that way?

910
01:33:23,786 --> 01:33:28,708
I'm willing to wipe the slate clean
and forget. I want you to get

911
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:32,253
your priorities straightened out,
quit hangin' out with hoodlums,

912
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:36,174
and sign your commitment to your team.
Have you done that yet?

913
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:41,679
I'm still thinkin'. - No one's paying
you to think about it. Just do it!

914
01:33:43,431 --> 01:33:45,600
You know, Coach?

915
01:33:46,351 --> 01:33:51,564
I gotta get goin'. Me and my loser
friends gotta get Aerosmith tickets.

916
01:33:51,981 --> 01:33:53,566
Top priority of the summer.

917
01:33:57,737 --> 01:34:01,324
Oh, Coach, I forgot.

918
01:34:04,243 --> 01:34:08,790
I might play ball,
but I will never sign that!

919
01:34:20,093 --> 01:34:21,260
Let's rock and roll!

920
01:34:22,053 --> 01:34:24,806
Alright, man. Livin'.

921
01:34:25,598 --> 01:34:31,979
I'm gettin' my third wind.
You gonna come? - Shotgun!

922
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:37,193
You guys not goin'?
- Can I use your keys?

923
01:34:37,944 --> 01:34:40,947
Time to boogie on outta here.
- Hey.

924
01:34:41,364 --> 01:34:43,324
So that's that?

925
01:34:50,206 --> 01:34:52,166
I never get shotgun!

926
01:35:08,599 --> 01:35:10,017
Hi, Mom.

927
01:35:10,434 --> 01:35:16,190
This is your one
"get- outta- jail- free" card.

928
01:35:16,607 --> 01:35:19,777
Hope you enjoyed it.
- No.

929
01:35:20,194 --> 01:35:25,324
Your sister told me everything, so
I've decide to make this deal.

930
01:35:25,741 --> 01:35:29,161
I'm gonna be open- minded this time.

931
01:35:29,579 --> 01:35:34,709
Next time you come in at sunrise,
we've got problems.

932
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:46,387
And who is this older girl
who gave you a ride?

933
01:35:46,929 --> 01:35:48,556
She's just like...

934
01:35:49,557 --> 01:35:50,975
Have you been drinking?

935
01:35:51,934 --> 01:35:53,019
No!

936
01:35:53,811 --> 01:35:54,854
Are you drunk?
