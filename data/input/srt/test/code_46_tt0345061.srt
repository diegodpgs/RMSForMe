1
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,434
I think about the day we met.

2
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,510
I suppose you would have
arrived par avion.

3
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,945
Maybe you were the first
to get to security.

4
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,844
You didn't intend to stay.

5
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,150
You only had 24-hour cover,
so luggage a mano.

6
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,885
And they probably had a driver waiting...

7
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,052
so you didn't need to find un coche.

8
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:56,004
You'd never been to Shanghai before.
It was all new to you.

9
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,270
How do people live out here?

10
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,944
It's not living. Just existing.

11
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,811
- You ever lived al fuera?
- No.

12
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,986
Can I have your papel, please?

13
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:22,664
Sherbet fountains, cigarettes,
batteries, haircuts.

14
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,930
Who gets their hair cut at a checkpoint?

15
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,468
But I'm vite. I will show you.

16
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,703
- Give me a couple of sherbet fountains.
- Two sherbet fountains.

17
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,144
Get me in, mister.
I can do haircuts in there.

18
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,981
- I'm wasted out here.
- I've only got cover for myself.

19
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,783
- You got any spare cover?
- I only cover for one.

20
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,153
- Sorry.
- You want to swap places with me?

21
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,956
- You and me?
- I wear suit, you wear this.

22
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,099
It's tempting. Good luck.
What's your name?

23
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,326
- Nabil.
- All right. Bye.

24
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,500
I don't think it's a good idea
to encourage them.

25
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,242
If people can't get cover,
there's a reason.

26
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,550
You arrived in the morning,
so the streets were deserted.

27
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,831
Did you call anyone?
Did you have a cerveza?

28
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,732
Sometimes I imagine you watching the news.

29
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,772
Sometimes playing a game.

30
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,640
Sometimes sleeping,
preparing yourself for the night ahead.

31
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,109
The thing I can't imagine
is that we hadn't met.

32
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,549
Hadn't even heard of each other.

33
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,622
That you thought it was going to be
just another night.

34
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,432
Happy birthday, Maria. Time to wake up.

35
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,270
It was my birthday, which I hate.

36
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,751
Every year on my birthday I have a dream.

37
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,522
Always the same dream.

38
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,484
I go down into the subway,
I wait for the train.

39
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,561
I'm worried I'm going to be late.

40
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,726
The train leaves the station.

41
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,835
I feel like going to sleep,
but there's someone I have to find.

42
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,466
And I have to find him
before the train stops.

43
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,807
The train goes through one station.

44
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,211
There are 19 more to go.
I have to find him.

45
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,979
And then I wake up.

46
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,050
Happy birthday, Maria. Time to wake up.

47
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,333
The next year I had exactly
the same dream.

48
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,331
Only this time I went past two stations.

49
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,905
Don't ask me how I knew. I just knew
that there were 18 stations to go.

50
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,147
Next year, 17. Next year, 16.

51
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,773
Every birthday, one less.

52
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,715
Today's my birthday.
Today I'm down to the last one.

53
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,057
If I fall asleep,
I'll get to my destination.

54
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,556
If I want to, I can discover
my fate tonight.

55
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,961
- Lo siento.
- That's okay.

56
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,942
So, what am I going to do?

57
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,280
I'm going to stay awake all day.

58
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,908
Who wants to discover their fate?

59
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,178
Who wants to take a chance like that?

60
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,489
- Hello.
- I'm here to see Mr. Backland.

61
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,184
I'll let him know you're here,
he'll send someone along.

62
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,353
I'm here on an investigation,
and I would find it useful...

63
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,624
if I could wander around a little bit.

64
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:49,190
All visitors have to be accompanied,
so if you'd like to wait over there.

65
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,770
- Someone will take you through.
- Let me do my job.

66
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,068
If I let you do yours,
then I wouldn't be doing mine, would I?

67
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,607
That is a conundrum.

68
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:01,072
If I could figure out your password,
your palabra...

69
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,108
You couldn't do it.

70
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,446
I just need to know
one piece of information.

71
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:09,749
- Is this some kind of trick?
- No. It could be anything. Just one thing.

72
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,484
Tell me one thing about yourself.
Anything at all.

73
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,221
My birthday. My palabra's
not my birthday. Vingt-neuf.

74
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,229
Your palabra is "carrefour."

75
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,200
- Crossroad. Carrefour.
- Wait. How did you know that?

76
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,066
- Can I register now?
- How did you know my palabra?

77
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,766
I listened to you
while you weren't speaking.

78
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,673
- Don't worry about it.
- I could get into trouble doing this.

79
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,234
I'm just gonna go straight to his office,
that's all I'm gonna do.

80
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,310
Don't worry about it.

81
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,424
- William Geld, salaam.
- Mr. Backland.

82
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,056
You caught me off guard.

83
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,567
I was going to come down
and greet you properly.

84
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,036
I guess that's one of your skills.
Cunning.

85
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,304
I have no cunning I'm afraid.

86
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,041
- This is your first visit?
- Yes.

87
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,876
Will you have time to see the mammoth?

88
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,118
We specialize in
short-term cover certificates.

89
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,984
We do limited cover pour specific tasks.

90
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,525
Maybe a parachute jump,
maybe a medical procedure.

91
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,158
People only buy fakes
if we won't grant legitimate cover.

92
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,100
If we won't grant legitimate cover,
believe me, there's a reason.

93
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,629
The Sphinx knows best.

94
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,668
Fake cover is a ticket
to avoidable suffering.

95
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,071
I worry about them, you know.

96
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,947
We know which printer the fakes come from.

97
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,040
Every printer has its own fingerprint.

98
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,353
This one is from our number 8 printer.

99
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,781
Only a few people are cleared to use it.
It has to be one of them.

100
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,554
All I need is a nice quiet room
and some time...

101
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,391
and I'll have this cleared up for you
by this evening.

102
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:03,001
It's a happy workplace.
I don't want to create an atmosphere.

103
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,694
I don't want anyone
to know what's going on.

104
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,332
Tell them what you like.
Tell them I'm the tooth fairy.

105
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,286
Tell me something about yourself,
anything at all.

106
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,656
I was born in Nampally Road, Hyderabad.

107
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,387
- Tell me something about yourself.
- Anything?

108
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,293
Try to make it interesting,
I've got a long day ahead of me.

109
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:40,703
I have una cosa about freckles.
A sexual cosa.

110
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,732
I find freckles a turn-on.

111
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,844
Freckled skin, it's like it's clothed
and not clothed.

112
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,845
There's no freckle pornography.

113
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,352
Women get famous for breasts and legs,
but not for freckles.

114
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,251
There's Anne of Green Gables.

115
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,617
I regard Anne of Green Gables
as an erotic classic.

116
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,830
Normans. Amazing.

117
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,398
They invented the whole English language
out of nothing but French.

118
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,636
And some Latin, obviously.

119
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,333
Yeah, obviously.

120
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,476
There's a girl here, Maria.

121
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,809
She's tone-deaf.

122
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,812
She can't hold a tune to save her life.

123
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,852
That's beautiful, don't you think?

124
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,123
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking, "Have we met before?"

125
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,632
Upstairs, the foyer,
we almost bumped into each other.

126
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,660
I feel I know you.

127
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,237
Come on. One thing about yourself.

128
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,041
I'm not sure I want you to know
something about me.

129
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:58,640
Anyway, I can never think of anything
when people ask me straight out comme ça.

130
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,948
You want to prompt me?

131
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,749
- It won't work if I prompt you.
- What won't work?

132
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,591
Tell me what you're doing later tonight.

133
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,557
- Is that a question or an invitation?
- It's a prompt.

134
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,633
Tonight, I am going to stay awake...

135
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,369
until the sun goes down.

136
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,179
I'm not going to sleep.

137
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,741
Pourquoi?

138
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,048
It's my birthday.

139
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,548
Happy birthday.

140
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:50,135
I'm gonna need to take your information
for future reference.

141
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,201
It's difficult.

142
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:04,176
When you can get a big dinero
for a piece of paper...

143
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,875
it's a big temptation.

144
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,720
Are you sure it's him?

145
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,255
- I thought it might be her.
- I don't think so.

146
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,519
Do you have evidence?

147
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,828
I don't need to give you evidence.
It's intuition you're paying for.

148
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,326
You okay?

149
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,367
Bueno. Absolutely.

150
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:18,984
- Am I under surveillance?
- No.

151
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,449
So what? Do you wanna go out with me?

152
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,386
It's your birthday.
Don't you have other plans?

153
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:31,259
I have to meet someone later,
but I'm hungry.

154
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,193
- Let's go and eat.
- All right.

155
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,031
I was never scared of you.
Even when I should have been.

156
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,808
Even though my fate was in your hands,
I always trusted you.

157
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,979
Why did you do it?

158
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,619
For the money. Why did you do it?

159
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,582
- What?
- Lie for me.

160
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,059
I don't know.

161
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,127
It's very impulsive.

162
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,897
I can be impulsive.

163
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,635
- Happy birthday.
- I love these.

164
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,711
How did you know? Is that on my file?

165
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,181
- Lucky guess.
- Fate.

166
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,812
Actually, I have a whole bag full of them.
For my kid.

167
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,020
- You have a kid?
- Yeah.

168
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,255
- Chico or chica?
- Chico.

169
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,987
Jim. His name is Jim.

170
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,365
I bet he's very special.

171
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,459
He is special.

172
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,799
Everybody's children are so special.

173
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:49,170
It makes you wonder where
all the ordinary grown-ups come from.

174
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,834
These are good.

175
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,739
You wanna come to a club?

176
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,449
Don't you have to meet someone?

177
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,619
- Come. I want you to.
- Why?

178
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,487
Because I want to corrupt you.

179
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,225
If you come, there's a definite risk
that you'll have a good time.

180
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,562
And if you don't come with me,
then you'll regret it.

181
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,266
Come on.

182
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,404
Come on.

183
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,873
- Drink?
- Vodka, rocks, please.

184
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,465
- Would you like to sing?
- No.

185
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,771
- Are you sure?
- No. I'm sure.

186
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,573
You don't wanna hear me sing.

187
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,756
- I was actually hoping to hear you sing.
- Why?

188
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:16,018
Someone told me
that you have a very distinctive voice.

189
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,127
What else did they say about me
behind my back?

190
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,359
You can take a virus
to make you more musical.

191
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,902
Gives you perfect pitch.
You sing like an angel.

192
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:28,531
I tried a virus once for Mandarin Chinese.

193
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,768
Chinese people knew what I was saying,
but I didn't.

194
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,845
It was weird. I didn't like it.

195
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,951
I'm on a virus right now,
an empathy virus.

196
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,484
I take an empathy virus
to help with my work.

197
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,117
I don't like that, that's weird.
That's like you could pick up...

198
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,695
- all sorts of stuff about me.
- Yeah, I can.

199
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,459
That's like wearing x-ray specs
to look at girls' underwear.

200
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,865
- I bought x-ray specs, they don't work.
- But you bought them?

201
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,835
- Yeah.
- You wanted them to work.

202
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,271
I was 6 years old. I was interested
in skeletons, not underwear.

203
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,071
I thought you were
a natural intuitive hombre.

204
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,852
Would it make any difference?

205
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,151
- Claro.
- Really?

206
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,187
- Maria.
- Damian. Hello.

207
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,931
William, Damian. Damian, William.

208
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,728
Darling, you got to let me know

209
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,970
Should I stay or should I go

210
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,131
Hi.

211
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,242
If you say that you are mine

212
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,975
I'll be here till the end of time

213
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,776
William is helping me celebrate
my birthday.

214
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,681
- It's your birthday?
- Yeah.

215
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,481
- I didn't know.
- That's okay.

216
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,921
William is okay.
William knows about our secret.

217
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,625
That's the one that will take me.

218
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,634
You should kiss William, too,
because he helped.

219
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:06,670
If I go there will be trouble

220
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,104
Tell him what you're going to do with it.

221
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,335
I'm a naturalist. I study bats.

222
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,679
The finest quality of bats in this world
is in this cave in Delhi.

223
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,011
I wanted to see that since I was a kid.

224
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,646
You couldn't get cover in the normal way?

225
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:26,588
I have tried for eight years.
And only now am I going.

226
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,420
Usually if you can't get cover,
there's a good reason.

227
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,520
Yes, "The Sphinx knows...

228
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,394
- "best."
- "Best."

229
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,230
- The Sphinx knows a lot.
- Doesn't know what I know.

230
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,531
Some things in life can be worth the risk.

231
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,936
Anyone who has ever
wanted something knows...

232
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,508
you have to be prepared
to take a risk to get it.

233
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,441
I think I'll be okay.

234
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,383
- Good luck.
- Bye.

235
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,111
If I go there will be trouble

236
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,917
Why did you do that?

237
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,584
- What?
- All that, in front of me.

238
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,992
You know what I should do?
Arrange to have his cover withdrawn...

239
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,692
and I should put him
al fuera and you, too.

240
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,769
But you're not going to, though. Are you?

241
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,638
Why are you being so nice to me?

242
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,109
Are you hoping for a reward?

243
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,938
How do you get the papeles out?

244
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,918
At the beginning of every new batch
we do a test run.

245
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,512
Then we destroy the papel.

246
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,717
I go in to work
and I have a fake papel under my tongue.

247
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:38,660
I destroy the fake one
and put the real papel under my tongue.

248
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:43,233
I then go to the bathroom,
put the papel into a pill, swallow it.

249
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,302
A couple of days later, I have the papel.

250
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,164
Impressed?

251
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,974
Come on, be impressed.

252
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:47,958
Thank you for bringing me home.
It's very kind of you.

253
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,340
Come in.

254
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,054
Beautiful. You have green fingers.

255
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,027
Everything is controlled scientifically.

256
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,893
Do you think that sunlight
is as dangerous as they say?

257
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,730
I hope not.

258
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,941
- Would you like a drink? A glass of water?
- Sure.

259
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,048
One of my fingers
is younger than the others.

260
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,980
- Really?
- Yeah.

261
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,019
- Which one?
- This one.

262
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,579
Do you like it?

263
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,691
Very much.

264
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,422
It's much better than the other fingers.
Definitely.

265
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,331
Maybe I should get them
to grow me a younger face.

266
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:06,929
No.

267
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,107
I love the sorrows of your changing face.

268
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,567
Or whatever it is.

269
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,949
I haven't seen this book in a while.

270
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,823
"In a friend one should have
one's best enemy...

271
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:35,460
"and you should be closest to him
when you resist him."

272
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:05,989
Look.

273
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:12,068
It's all I've got left from my childhood.

274
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,896
I keep my special memories here.

275
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,642
- Who are they?
- My father and mother.

276
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,740
Before we left Shanghai.

277
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:28,546
These are people like Damian,
when I give them the papeles.

278
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,316
Now you know all my secrets.

279
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,925
I love to look at their faces.

280
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,296
They're so beautiful.

281
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,131
Look at their eyes.

282
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,134
They have a look
that the rest of us don't have.

283
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,679
You look like them un poco.

284
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,354
You should go to sleep.

285
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,664
I don't want to go to sleep.
Please don't let me sleep.

286
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,311
I'll make you some coffee.

287
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,308
Coffee.

288
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,133
Said I remember

289
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,607
When we used to sit

290
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:48,076
In a government yard in Trenchtown

291
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:52,950
And Georgie would make the firelight

292
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:57,689
Logwood burning through the night

293
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:01,721
No woman, no cry

294
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:06,526
No woman, no cry

295
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,497
I was just gonna torture the song
and now you're murdering it.

296
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:11,973
I'm tone-deaf.

297
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,240
You find that attractive?

298
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,355
Are you leaving?

299
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,893
I'm booked on a flight home.

300
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,225
- What time's your flight?
- 11:00.

301
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,991
What will happen to Bikku?

302
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,535
He'll lose his cover.

303
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,774
That's bad.

304
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,076
I know it's bad.

305
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,944
You giving out fake papers is bad.
Me letting you off is bad.

306
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,676
Have you ever lived outside?

307
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,953
I was outside for 10 years.

308
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,832
Lo siento.

309
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,758
I have to go.

310
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:35,636
- I need to stop at the entry checkpoint.
- Why?

311
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,068
I need to get more sherbet fountains.

312
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,338
Hi, mister.

313
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,174
I found this.
I thought you could put it to good use.

314
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,077
Thank you. Gracias. God bless you. Go.

315
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,011
Sorry.

316
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,320
Leave him alone. Thank you, God bless you.

317
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,783
If we had enough information...

318
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,727
we could predict
the consequences of our actions.

319
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,030
Would you want to know?

320
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:39,427
If you kiss that girl,
if you talk to that man...

321
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:43,439
if you take that job or marry that woman
or steal that papel?

322
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,902
If we knew what would happen in the end...

323
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,810
would we ever be able to take the first step,
to make the first move?

324
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,518
Hello, I'm home.

325
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:10,063
- Did you have a good trip?
- It went all right.

326
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,197
Daddy! Where have you been?

327
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:21,074
They'd be pleased to see you.
Your wife, your special boy.

328
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,307
They'd want to know all your news...

329
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,441
and will be glad to have you home,
safe and sound.

330
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,919
- Want me to guess what you're thinking?
- Yeah.

331
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,756
- Bicycle.
- Sí.

332
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,937
I can't answer right now,
so leave a message.

333
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:53,509
It's William, call me.
Just to let me know you're okay.

334
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,071
Bye.

335
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,122
- Are you tired?
- Yeah.

336
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,701
Did you think about me at all?

337
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,237
Did you try to imagine
what was happening to me?

338
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,641
Does an empathy virus work long-distance?

339
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:04,170
Maria Gonzalez, age 25.
Employee of the Sphinx.

340
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,041
Nurture father: Christian Gunter.

341
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,718
Born in Freeport of Jebel Ali.
Transferred to Shanghai.

342
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,857
He was exiled
for financial irregularities.

343
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,187
Recorded in Kunming, Dhanbad...

344
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,731
Quetta and Baghdad.

345
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:25,491
Presumed to be returning
to the Freeport of Jebel Ali.

346
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,732
Carmen Gonzalez returned to Shanghai.

347
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,633
Remarried to...

348
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,837
Maria Gonzalez.

349
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,182
Height: 165 cms.

350
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,079
Buenos días.
De Souza wants to talk to you.

351
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,747
- What about?
- There's been a fatality in Asia.

352
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,347
A guy was traveling on one of the papers
from Shanghai.

353
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,160
- She's waiting. You want a coffee?
- No, thanks.

354
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:56,291
- Hello.
- Someone died yesterday.

355
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,825
I heard. Do you have details?

356
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,639
Hombre had una cosa about bats,
wanted to go to Delhi.

357
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,709
The place to be
if you like bats, apparently.

358
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:11,245
Couldn't get cover because he had an
ineluctable disposition to Ward's Disease.

359
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,040
Do you know it?

360
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,049
- No.
- It makes you bleed to death.

361
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,280
Most people in Delhi are immune,
which is why...

362
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:22,485
this hombre couldn't get cover,
which is why he bought fake papeles...

363
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,191
which is why he bled to death yesterday.

364
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,460
- What was his name?
- Alekan. Damian Alekan.

365
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:35,729
The papeles come from the same printer
as the ones you investigated.

366
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,773
I'm sorry.

367
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,239
Get back, make it right,
then you won't have to be sorry anymore.

368
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:47,044
- Is there someone else you can send?
- Why would you want me to do that?

369
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:52,345
I had some trouble when I was there.
Some trouble with the virus, I think.

370
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,989
We all have problems, William.

371
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,420
How we deal with them
is a measure of our worth.

372
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,997
Go back tomorrow.

373
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,196
Damian Alekan.

374
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:31,921
- Where did you get that? Someone gave it...
- I have to go back to Shanghai.

375
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,054
How long will you be away?

376
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,156
I have a 24-hour cover.

377
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,762
I'll be back before you know I've gone.

378
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,732
Messed it all up.

379
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,202
Welcome, sir.

380
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,946
Three more forged papeles reported.

381
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,821
One here, one in Sao Paolo, one in Delhi.

382
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,229
If this doesn't stop,
I could lose my own cover.

383
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,766
Lo siento, it's the first time
my intuition has let me down.

384
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,995
I think he had an accomplice.
There was a woman here last time...

385
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,231
- Maria Gonzalez.
- She's gone.

386
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,508
What do you mean gone? Disappeared?

387
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,769
I was told she had a body issue.

388
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,973
It was all official.

389
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,160
Maria?

390
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,804
Video Listo Corporation.

391
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:58,339
Hello. I just tried to get in my apartment
and the video listo no funciona.

392
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:01,934
We have your number listed
as temporarily descontinuado.

393
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,537
Do I look descontinuado to you?

394
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,512
No, señor, but then I don't know
that you're the holder.

395
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,917
- That's not my problem, is it?
- If you can give me your palabra...

396
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:14,354
I can provide you with a 10-minute window
to recode your video listo.

397
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,222
- How would that be?
- That would be great, thank you.

398
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,262
- Palabra, sir?
- Panoply.

399
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,798
Did you know what you were looking for?

400
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,398
Or were you hoping I had left you a clue?

401
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:36,241
Like Hansel and Gretel
being dragged off into the woods.

402
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,575
Panoply.

403
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,686
Maria, today you have no appointments.

404
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:59,193
Maria, today you have a 3:15 appointment
at the Mai Lin Clinic.

405
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:14,081
I'm investigating a fraud
to which Maria Gonzalez is a key witness.

406
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:17,680
I was officially informed
that she has some body issues...

407
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,153
and was on a happiness break.

408
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,852
She has been relocated.

409
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,427
There were complications
that we couldn't deal with.

410
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,326
She has been sent outside.

411
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:31,661
Outside is a big place,
it would help if you were more specific.

412
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,660
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.

413
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,508
What was the nature of her body issue?

414
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,973
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.

415
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,745
Why was she summoned
for a happiness break?

416
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,015
Is this a training exercise?

417
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,087
- Are you trying to catch me out?
- You got me.

418
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,590
- You didn't get me, though.
- You are top of the class.

419
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,923
Very good. Tell me something
about yourself, anything.

420
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,897
For the report. I have to write this up.

421
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,895
My mother had this job before me.

422
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,033
I inherited it.

423
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,811
How long has Miss Gonzalez been pregnant?

424
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,914
I never said that.

425
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,581
What type of Code 46 violation was it?

426
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,350
I never mentioned Code 46.

427
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,154
Where is the Mai Lin Clinic?

428
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:36,358
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.

429
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,326
Thank you for your help.

430
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,781
You rented a car. The clinic was al fuera.

431
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,516
170 K outside the city.

432
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,758
I imagine you like a medieval knight
on a quest.

433
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,426
A quest for me.

434
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,418
I'm here to see Maria Gonzalez.

435
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,083
Lo siento,
no visitors are permitted until 6:00.

436
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:39,151
I'm from Westerfields.
She's a key witness in a major fraud case.

437
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,862
- Nombre?
- Maria Gonzalez.

438
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,533
- Tu nombre?
- William Geld. I'm with Westerfields.

439
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,933
I need your print here.

440
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,164
It's a very urgent situation.

441
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,564
I know. Nombre and print.

442
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:57,806
I can tell by looking at you
that you are not just...

443
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,343
a keypad presser.

444
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,915
You can make judgments.

445
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,749
Sí, and I have made my judgment about you.

446
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,983
If you don't have authorization
for this place...

447
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,587
Tell me one thing about yourself.
Anything at all.

448
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,684
Okay.

449
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,762
I'm tired.

450
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:18,062
I have conversations like this one a lot.
Is that enough?

451
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:22,696
If I were able to guess your palabra,
would you be impressed?

452
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,671
I would be dumbfounded.

453
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,570
- It's "Garamond."
- No, it's not. It's nothing like that.

454
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,573
Did you have an empathy virus?
It doesn't work here.

455
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,117
That's why you've got a cold. Here.

456
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,448
We use antiviral bacteria.

457
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,989
The institute is infested
with streptococci.

458
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,861
You know, here on the outside...

459
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:48,124
we do not have access
to some of the pleasures...

460
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:51,133
that are so freely available
on the inside.

461
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,870
I have these.

462
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:06,010
- The gold ones are particularly bueno.
- I don't need wealth.

463
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,243
I just need a little encouragement.

464
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:15,853
You have a very
sophisticated security system here.

465
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,860
Claro. We have all categories
of cases here.

466
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,461
What is Maria Gonzalez here for?

467
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,461
You're investigating
her case, n'est-ce pas?

468
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,504
I'm investigating a fraud case.
She's a witness.

469
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,008
She's had a finger-graft.

470
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,383
Maria Gonzalez?

471
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,016
Take a seat.

472
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,419
- You okay?
- I'm good.

473
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,957
If this is about my finger,
then I don't want to prosecute.

474
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:57,233
This is not about your finger.

475
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,138
I need to speak to Miss Gonzalez alone.

476
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,431
You have no authorization.

477
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,468
Okay.

478
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:18,083
I'm investigating an incident
at your place of work.

479
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:21,089
Fraudulent papeles
issued from your printer.

480
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,764
In the last 14 days,
three people have died...

481
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,530
while traveling from papeles...

482
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,070
issued from your printer at the Sphinx.

483
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,468
The people who come to us,
they're all doing something dangerous.

484
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,474
You have to expect that, unfortunately,
some of them won't make it.

485
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,611
One of them...

486
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,920
Damian Alekan, bled to death.
He was fond of bats. Remember him?

487
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,527
No.

488
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,153
Damian Alekan? You met him at a bar.

489
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:03,062
You sold him a papel
which allowed him to go to Delhi.

490
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,327
- When did he die?
- A week ago.

491
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,931
I've been in here for 10 days.

492
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,096
All of the papeles were issued
prior to your arriving here.

493
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,180
I'm tired. I would like to rest.

494
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,708
Miss Gonzalez is still in recovery.

495
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:36,090
Why is she in here?

496
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,430
And, please, do not use the word "finger"
at any point in your answer.

497
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,061
- Her finger...
- Was damaged and regrown...

498
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,073
on her family's insurance policy
22 years ago.

499
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,040
I know a great deal about Miss Gonzalez.

500
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:50,136
For instance, that she was pregnant
when she came in here.

501
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,545
I also know,
because you told me so yourself...

502
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:55,743
that you have no interest
in impeding my investigation.

503
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,448
She violated Code 46.

504
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,314
We've terminated the pregnancy...

505
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:05,259
and taken out the memory cluster
immediately around it.

506
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,220
- The baby was terminated?
- There was no baby.

507
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:12,063
Just a pregnancy which is now terminated
and the memories removed.

508
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,174
You've interfered...

509
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,711
with the memory of a key witness
in an insurance fraud.

510
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,213
The memories were very local.

511
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:28,284
It's just the man, the sex act,
and the pregnancy.

512
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,211
She doesn't remember the man at all?

513
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:34,085
The man, the sex, the pregnancy.
We've erased all of them.

514
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,921
Apart from that,
it's the same Maria Gonzalez.

515
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:40,524
The finger is a placebo memory.
I moved it from her childhood.

516
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,461
I think it's very effective.

517
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,532
When will she be able to leave?

518
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,638
She's due to leave tomorrow.

519
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:53,574
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to release her to me now.

520
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,416
Can you miss someone you don't remember?

521
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:03,953
Can one moment or experience
ever disappear completely?

522
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:08,782
Or does it always exist somewhere,
waiting to be discovered?

523
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,758
- Wait, I've forgotten something.
- What?

524
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:16,932
- A valise. It's very important to me.
- It's in the back. Voilà.

525
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,347
Is that what you're going to do?

526
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,207
Put me al fuera with them?

527
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:39,919
You've been outside before.
Spent 10 years al fuera.

528
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,719
Didn't come back inside till you were 14.

529
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,621
You really did your homework.

530
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:50,159
You can't sing, you like sherbet fountains,
you like to grow real plants from seed.

531
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,096
God, I must have been
your favorite subject at school.

532
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,066
You hate the desert.

533
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,600
I always hated the desert.

534
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,712
Even at college,
studying the Roadrunner cartoons...

535
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,340
I had to look away.

536
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:13,316
I've always wondered why the coyote
didn't just go out and buy a roadrunner.

537
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,151
If he had enough money
for rocket-powered roller skates...

538
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,693
he had enough money to buy a roadrunner.

539
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,393
How did you do that?

540
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,091
What?

541
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:30,066
I was thinking something and you heard me.
That is weird.

542
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:32,571
Intuition.

543
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:36,343
I can feel what you're thinking.

544
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:40,314
I don't believe in mind-reading.
I think it is all a trick.

545
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,609
It's not a trick. It is a gift.

546
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,119
What am I thinking now?

547
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,826
You're thinking of Damian Alekan.

548
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,404
- Have you been here before?
- Once.

549
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:15,883
You like it?

550
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,080
I was only here a day.

551
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,321
But, yes, I liked it very much.

552
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,619
Excuse the mess.

553
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:10,870
Come here.

554
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,645
Sit down.

555
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,801
That's Damian.

556
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,165
Recognize him now?

557
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,942
I remember he wanted to go to Delhi.

558
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:57,318
And I remember the look on his face
when I gave him the papel.

559
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:02,350
He tried for years to get one officially
and he couldn't get one.

560
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:21,607
I was there when you met Damian.
I was with you in the bar.

561
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,578
I don't understand.

562
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,810
You don't remember
because they erased your memory.

563
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:32,952
I don't know what you're talking about.

564
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,956
I came to Shanghai to investigate a fraud.

565
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,796
I knew you were guilty.

566
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,566
But then I fell in love with you.

567
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,072
Why would they erase my memory of you?

568
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,749
I don't know.

569
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,889
My cosa. Where's my cosa?

570
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:27,272
- I can't find my cosa.
- Come here. You haven't lost anything.

571
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,435
Calm down.

572
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,911
- I can't find my cosa.
- It's okay.

573
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:33,644
I don't know where my cosa is.

574
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,685
Will you stay with me?

575
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,362
- I'm so tired.
- I'll stay with you until you wake up.

576
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,769
- What is it?
- It'll help you sleep.

577
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:04,940
- I don't understand anything.
- I don't understand anything either.

578
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,049
My father used to tell me stories
as I fell asleep.

579
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:16,124
Stories about Jebel Ali
and the Arabian Sea.

580
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:21,526
Stories of magic and adventure.

581
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,590
He used to live there...

582
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:28,831
and believed that if we could return,
everything would be all right.

583
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:34,009
Everything would be like it used to be
before we were exiled.

584
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:41,310
And in my dreams I was there.

585
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,353
Sample, please.

586
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,597
Thank you.

587
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:04,202
I'm pleased to tell you that
I've screened both your sets of genes...

588
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:06,298
and there are no Code 46 issues.

589
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:10,243
It is perfectly safe for you to marry.
In fact, I'd recommend it.

590
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,375
You both have the code
for high intelligence.

591
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,915
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

592
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,813
Do you know this woman?

593
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,019
I'm looking for her.

594
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,424
You must have found her, hombre,
if you have her hair.

595
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,192
It was given to me by relatives.

596
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:35,964
- What's your relationship to this woman?
- I just want to know about her.

597
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,141
You can't liaise with her.

598
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,440
See this? This is your DNA.

599
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,506
A 50% match with the hair samples.

600
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,414
And here...

601
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,410
is the DNA of your mother.

602
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,751
A 100% match. Genetically identical.

603
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:57,955
Any liaison with this woman
would be a Code 46 violation.

604
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,630
- How can that be?
- Anything's possible in vitro.

605
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,430
Your mother was one of a batch
of 24 cloned fetuses.

606
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:09,705
This hair is from your mother
or one of her genetic twins.

607
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:14,436
- This woman is identical to my mother?
- No.

608
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:18,481
Diet...

609
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,307
climate, environment, accident...

610
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,147
surgery, the stars, God.

611
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,117
We aren't prisoners of our genes.

612
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,954
Is this hair from your mother?

613
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:33,985
No.

614
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:39,031
- Are you in love with this woman?
- Why?

615
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,595
- Is she pregnant?
- No.

616
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,331
- Were you naturally conceived?
- In vitro.

617
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:51,541
Your nurture parents will have
your records, if that's any help.

618
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,081
They're dead.

619
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,281
I'm sorry.

620
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:28,042
If we're frightened, we run.

621
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,911
It's our instinct.

622
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:34,120
Adrenalin pumps round the body,
the muscles contract...

623
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:37,317
our heart beats faster, and we run.

624
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,556
We run for our lives.

625
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,221
We run for safety...

626
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:46,029
for our home, our families,
our loved ones.

627
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,471
Sylvie.

628
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:53,406
You're driving.
I don't want you to drive and call.

629
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:56,168
I'm on my way to the airport.
I'll be home tomorrow.

630
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,577
- Catch the bad guy?
- Every time.

631
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,083
William, I love you.

632
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,145
I love you, too.

633
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,654
Daddy? Hello. How are you?

634
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,626
- Love you.
- Me you.

635
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,696
See you later.

636
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,685
Hi. I need a ticket to Seattle.

637
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,692
It's completely red, sir.
It's out of date.

638
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,388
See? You're not covered for the Asea area.

639
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,890
But I don't wanna be here.
I wanna leave, I wanna go home.

640
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,628
- I'm covered for home, right?
- I really don't know, sir.

641
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:54,998
I am covered for home.

642
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:59,200
But you're not at home, sir.
You're aquí in Shanghai without cover.

643
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:03,175
I got an idea. Why don't we just kick me out
in the general direction of home?

644
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:07,314
You can't fly uncovered, sir.
You can't be in the Asea area without cover.

645
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:10,511
What am I gonna do,
piss out the window at 60,000 feet?

646
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,056
I really wouldn't know enough
about your character to say, sir.

647
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:18,085
Maybe I can guess something
about your character.

648
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:20,221
These are particularly fun.

649
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,563
I'm afraid you guessed wrong, sir.

650
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:26,123
I'm a Christian scientist.
I don't believe in drugs or coffee.

651
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:27,694
Damn.

652
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,162
I'm all out of Bibles.

653
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,471
Can I come in?

654
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,770
Can I stop you?

655
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,018
I need your help.

656
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:20,922
Where have you been?

657
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,682
Lo siento. I had something to do.

658
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:29,663
I shouldn't be in Shanghai.
I should be in Seattle.

659
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,000
You knew that last night.

660
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,598
- I have to go.
- So go.

661
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,933
I can't.

662
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:41,336
My papel was red. I can't get out.

663
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,013
You tried already?

664
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,309
You were just going to disappear.

665
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,225
You say that too much.

666
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,220
I need to go home.

667
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,605
- You've got a family.
- Sí.

668
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,807
- Chico or chica?
- Chico.

669
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:22,173
He must think you're a real hero
for catching bad guys like me.

670
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:24,953
Something like that.

671
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:32,227
Well, you know what they say:
"The Sphinx knows best."

672
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,825
Maybe there's a reason you can't go home.

673
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,032
It's a fake, okay?

674
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:47,008
I have to swap it for a genuine papel.

675
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,481
I'll meet you at the airport
at 7:00, okay?

676
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,114
Come on.

677
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,666
My name is Maria Gonzalez
and I have an access problem.

678
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:23,574
I have a new finger
and it needs to be recoded.

679
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,307
- Just hold on a moment, please?
- Gracias.

680
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:33,479
- Buenos días.
- Bueno. So good to see you.

681
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,155
I have an access problem.

682
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:38,091
I have a new finger
and I need it to be recoded.

683
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:40,754
I know. You've been relocated.

684
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,731
- Sorry?
- You have been relocated.

685
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,391
You will work here now.

686
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,126
Why don't you come inside?

687
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:57,278
- William, where are you?
- Still in Shanghai.

688
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,110
Isn't your cover out?

689
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,612
- I've extended it.
- No, you haven't.

690
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:05,119
- Where is Maria Gonzalez?
- No lo sé.

691
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,952
Why did you remove her from Mai Lin Clinic
without authorization?

692
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:11,117
- She was a suspect.
- Was?

693
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:13,918
Is.

694
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,498
You seem upset, William.

695
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:19,524
Report to the Shanghai office, today.

696
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,003
They will take over the case.

697
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,730
Get me whatever you can,
but get it today, yeah?

698
01:10:18,531 --> 01:10:22,126
It's a single exit cover.
Valid for today only.

699
01:10:23,402 --> 01:10:25,233
Seattle flights leave from Zone C.

700
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,469
I do remember you.

701
01:10:31,777 --> 01:10:33,244
From a dream.

702
01:10:35,214 --> 01:10:36,909
From my birthday dream.

703
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:47,715
You should go home.

704
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:55,934
No.

705
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:12,174
Two for Jebel Ali.

706
01:11:12,284 --> 01:11:14,309
- Which flight, sir?
- Next flight.

707
01:11:14,754 --> 01:11:16,153
Do you have cover?

708
01:11:16,255 --> 01:11:17,620
I'm resident here.

709
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:21,149
Sorry, I forgot. It's my new finger.

710
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:26,388
Okay. Thanks for choosing
Pan Worldwide Airways.

711
01:11:26,499 --> 01:11:28,228
Have a safe journey.

712
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:37,035
I'd always dreamt of Jebel Ali.
The Jebel Ali of my father's stories.

713
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:41,979
He told me you could do anything there,
as long as you wanted it enough.

714
01:12:07,873 --> 01:12:09,340
You know what?

715
01:12:10,209 --> 01:12:14,942
Every time I ever imagined this,
I always imagined being with you.

716
01:12:15,715 --> 01:12:17,444
Even though we'd never met.

717
01:12:30,896 --> 01:12:32,454
- You okay?
- Yeah.

718
01:12:49,181 --> 01:12:51,547
We're looking for a place to stay.

719
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,109
Come, we are going, come.

720
01:13:01,594 --> 01:13:03,323
You've never been al fuera.

721
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:07,524
So I could be your guide, your teacher.

722
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,831
Three pakoras.

723
01:13:26,418 --> 01:13:28,978
We're looking for a room. We have cover.

724
01:13:29,255 --> 01:13:33,089
No one has cover for over here.
You can't buy cover for here.

725
01:13:33,526 --> 01:13:36,461
- Residents sleep at their own risk.
- But we can have a room?

726
01:13:36,929 --> 01:13:39,659
A room, food, a game of chess.

727
01:13:40,132 --> 01:13:43,829
There's a shower through there.
You're covered in dust.

728
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,077
It will be noisy, lo siento.

729
01:13:58,317 --> 01:14:00,046
That doesn't matter.

730
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,780
We'll sleep through anything.
We're so tired.

731
01:14:03,889 --> 01:14:06,380
- Have you come a long way?
- Yes.

732
01:14:08,894 --> 01:14:10,293
My wife made that.

733
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:13,126
Before she passed on.

734
01:14:13,232 --> 01:14:15,860
Maybe think about her un poco
before you sleep.

735
01:14:19,138 --> 01:14:20,571
Pleasure to have you.

736
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,013
Will you put this on?

737
01:14:53,138 --> 01:14:55,606
- Does your wife look like you?
- No.

738
01:14:58,344 --> 01:14:59,936
How did you meet?

739
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:03,904
We worked together until we had Jim.

740
01:15:05,885 --> 01:15:07,512
You must miss him.

741
01:15:08,187 --> 01:15:09,245
Yes.

742
01:15:10,956 --> 01:15:12,284
Sing.

743
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:14,750
What?

744
01:15:15,527 --> 01:15:17,017
I want to hear you sing.

745
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,497
I can't sing.

746
01:15:30,342 --> 01:15:31,639
I'm sorry.

747
01:15:33,412 --> 01:15:36,381
It's okay. It's not your fault.

748
01:15:45,824 --> 01:15:47,155
It's viral.

749
01:15:50,829 --> 01:15:52,296
The Sphinx...

750
01:15:54,099 --> 01:15:55,930
gave you a virus.

751
01:15:58,203 --> 01:16:01,639
What, like an anti-William virus?

752
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:05,804
It's involuntary. It's like adrenaline.

753
01:16:07,947 --> 01:16:09,414
When you're...

754
01:16:09,848 --> 01:16:13,249
scared of something,
your body gets ready to run away.

755
01:16:15,921 --> 01:16:17,718
I'm not scared of you.

756
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,656
I know. But your body is.

757
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,466
I want you to make love to me.

758
01:16:37,876 --> 01:16:39,867
Make me make love to you.

759
01:18:07,332 --> 01:18:08,697
I love you.

760
01:19:59,011 --> 01:20:01,809
You must have known
the way the virus works.

761
01:20:03,148 --> 01:20:05,616
Was there nothing you could do to stop me?

762
01:20:09,588 --> 01:20:10,816
I need to make a call.

763
01:20:10,923 --> 01:20:13,050
- All calls are logged.
- That's okay.

764
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:16,059
- Phone is là-bas.
- Gracias.

765
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:26,227
My name is Maria Gonzalez,
and I'm reporting a Code 46 violation.

766
01:20:26,605 --> 01:20:29,267
Gracias. What is your location?

767
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:33,140
- What is this address?
- 168 Shada Perrera.

768
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:39,583
- Please wait there.
- I'll be right here.

769
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,374
Wake up.

770
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:13,611
Come on.

771
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:22,754
- We have to go.
- No, I want to stay here forever.

772
01:21:34,573 --> 01:21:36,541
See? I can kiss you now.

773
01:21:37,876 --> 01:21:39,776
We have to go. Come on.

774
01:21:40,912 --> 01:21:43,437
- Something's happened.
- Okay.

775
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:46,041
We need a car. Can you help?

776
01:21:46,418 --> 01:21:49,353
Cars are expensive here.
Even more than in the city.

777
01:21:50,055 --> 01:21:51,852
I've got these.

778
01:21:56,628 --> 01:21:59,529
I need money. People have to eat.

779
01:22:05,237 --> 01:22:06,795
That's all I've got.

780
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:09,900
Not enough.

781
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:20,812
Hey, Sono, take them to the sierat shop.
Tell Farrukh to give them a Padmini.

782
01:22:38,303 --> 01:22:40,066
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

783
01:23:37,129 --> 01:23:38,426
I love you.

784
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:55,446
Okay, all right.
That's enough playing now. Stop.

785
01:25:04,649 --> 01:25:06,708
You went before a tribunal.

786
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:10,586
They decided the empathy virus
had affected your judgment.

787
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,850
So they took away your memory of me.

788
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:15,653
Just like they had wiped my memory of you.

789
01:25:18,396 --> 01:25:20,990
What does he remember about the crash?

790
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:24,294
He knows he went to Shanghai.
He solved the case.

791
01:25:24,402 --> 01:25:26,802
On the way to the airport,
he crashed the hired car.

792
01:25:26,905 --> 01:25:30,272
As far as he's concerned,
he never went to Jebel Ali.

793
01:25:32,744 --> 01:25:35,645
- I'll leave you alone.
- Thank you.

794
01:25:43,455 --> 01:25:44,888
I've missed you.

795
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:47,319
Me, too.

796
01:25:50,161 --> 01:25:51,651
It's good to see you.

797
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:57,792
I've brought you some clothes.

798
01:26:01,473 --> 01:26:02,599
Daddy!

799
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:07,239
Where have you been?

800
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,738
Daddy did a silly thing.

801
01:26:10,115 --> 01:26:13,676
I crashed a car
but the doctors fixed him up real good.

802
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:20,289
What am I thinking?

803
01:26:25,363 --> 01:26:26,352
I don't know.

804
01:26:26,965 --> 01:26:29,297
Boats. I'm thinking about boats.

805
01:26:31,403 --> 01:26:35,567
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

806
01:26:37,142 --> 01:26:40,942
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream

807
01:26:58,263 --> 01:27:01,391
I was exiled because I tried
to cheat the Sphinx.

808
01:27:02,567 --> 01:27:04,558
They left me my memories.

809
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:08,100
They don't care what you think
if you're al fuera.

810
01:27:08,206 --> 01:27:09,571
Why bother?

811
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:12,475
To them, it's as though we don't exist.

812
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:21,016
Feels good.

813
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,913
I miss you.
