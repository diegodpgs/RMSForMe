00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,773
<i>Men, are you over 40?</i>

2
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,529
<i>When you wake up in the morning,
do you feel tired and rundown?</i>

3
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:34,367
<i>Do you have that listless feeling?</i>

4
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,095
- Jefferies.
- Congratulations, Jeff.

5
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:17,017
- For what?
- Getting rid of that cast.

6
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:18,603
Who said I was getting rid of it?

7
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:20,691
<i>This is Wednesday,</i>

8
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:25,366
<i>Seven weeks from the day you
broke your leg, Yes or no?</i>

9
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,912
<i>Gunnison, how did you get
to be such a big editor</i>

10
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
<i>with such a small memory?</i>

11
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,254
Thrift, industry and hard work...

12
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:35,385
<i>and catching the publisher
with his secretary,</i>

13
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:37,639
<i>- did I get the wrong day?
- No,</i>

14
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:39,893
No, wrong week.

15
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,028
Next Wednesday I emerge
from this... plaster cocoon.

16
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:49,911
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I
guess I can't be lucky every day.

17
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,373
<i>Forget I called,</i>

18
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,128
<i>Yeah, I sure feel
sorry for you, Gunnison,</i>

19
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:58,386
Must be rough on you thinking of me
wearing this cast for another week.

20
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:01,266
That one week is gonna cost
me my best photographer,

21
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,312
and you a big assignment.

22
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:04,522
Where?

23
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,526
<i>There's no point in
even talking about it,</i>

24
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:08,446
<i>Oh, come on, come on, Where?</i>

25
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:12,454
<i>Kashmir, Got a code tip from
the bureau chief this morning,</i>

26
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:14,541
<i>The place is about to go up in smoke,</i>

27
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,713
What did I tell you? Didn't I tell
you that's the next place to watch?

28
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,594
<i>- You did,
- When do I leave? Hour?</i>

29
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:25,144
- With that cast on? You don't.
- Stop sounding stuffy.

30
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:29,151
<i>I can take pictures from a jeep
or a water buffalo, if necessary,</i>

31
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,491
<i>You're too valuable to the
magazine for us to play around with,</i>

32
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:35,288
<i>- I'll send Morgan or Lambert,
- Morgan or Lambert,</i>

33
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,166
That's fine.

34
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,755
I get myself half-killed for you,

35
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,218
<i>and you reward me by
stealing my assignments,</i>

36
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,140
<i>I didn't ask you to stand in the
middle of an automobile racetrack,</i>

37
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:49,440
<i>You asked for something
dramatically different,</i>

38
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:52,153
<i>- You got it,
- So did you,</i>

39
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,323
- Goodbye, Jeff.
- Now, wait a minute, Gunnison.

40
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,369
You've got to get me out of here.

41
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:59,040
<i>Six weeks sitting in
a two-room apartment</i>

42
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:01,462
<i>with nothing to do but look out
the window at the neighbours,</i>

43
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,382
- Bye, Jeff.
- No, Gunnison, I...

44
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,055
<i>If you don't pull me out
of this swamp of boredom,</i>

45
00:06:07,222 --> 00:06:08,809
<i>I'm gonna do something drastic,</i>

46
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:11,189
<i>- Like what?
- "Like what?" Get married,</i>

47
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:13,318
<i>Then I'll never be able to go anywhere,</i>

48
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:14,862
<i>It's about time you got married,</i>

49
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:19,621
before you turn into a
lonesome and bitter, old man.

50
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:21,917
Yeah, can't you just see me?

51
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,964
<i>Rushing home to a hot apartment</i>

52
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:29,138
<i>to listen to the automatic
laundry and the electric dishwasher</i>

53
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,814
<i>and the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife,</i>

54
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,362
<i>Jeff, wives don't nag
any more, they discuss,</i>

55
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,867
<i>Is that so? Is that so?</i>

56
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:42,539
<i>Maybe in the high-rent
district they discuss,</i>

57
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:44,876
<i>In my neighbourhood, they still nag,</i>

58
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:49,050
<i>Well, you know best,
I'll call you later,</i>

59
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:53,433
Yeah, have some good
news the next time, huh?

60
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,870
<i>Good morning, I said, "Good morning!"</i>

61
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:50,707
Oh, good morning.

62
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:11,454
Say, I wouldn't dig
so deep if I were you.

63
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,461
You're giving them far too much water.

64
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:18,384
Why don't you shut up?

65
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:23,101
Well!

66
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,812
I do declare.

67
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,528
<i>State sentence for a peeping tom,</i>

68
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:30,281
is six months in the workhouse.

69
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:31,783
Oh, hello, sweetheart.

70
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,456
They got no windows in the workhouse.

71
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:38,463
In the old days, they used to put
your eyes out with a red-hot poker.

72
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,677
Any of those bikini bombshells
you're always watching

73
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:43,472
worth a red-hot poker?

74
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,517
Oh, dear.

75
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:48,398
We've become a race of Peeping Toms.

76
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:50,778
What people ought to do is
get outside their own house

77
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:52,489
and look in for a change.

78
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:56,330
Yes, sir. How's that for a
bit of homespun philosophy?

79
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:58,834
<i>Reader's digest, April 1939.</i>

80
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:01,381
Well, I only quote from the best.

81
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:03,343
You don't have to take my
temperature this morning.

82
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,181
Quiet. See if you can break 100.

83
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:08,644
You know, I should have
been a gypsy fortune-teller

84
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:11,107
instead of an insurance company nurse.

85
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:15,240
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.

86
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:19,540
You heard of that market
crash in '29? I predicted that.

87
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,919
Just how did you do that, Stella?

88
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:26,886
Oh, simple. I was nursing a
director of General Motors.

89
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:31,395
"Kidney ailment," they
said. "Nerves," I said.

90
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:32,939
Then I asked myself,

91
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,279
"What's General Motors
got to be nervous about?"

92
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:39,744
"Overproduction", I says. "Collapse."

93
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,292
When General Motors has to go
to the bathroom ten times a day,

94
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,796
the whole country's ready to let go.

95
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:50,055
You know, Stella, in
economics, a kidney ailment

96
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,934
has no relationship to the stock market.

97
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:55,147
<i>- None whatsoever.
- Crashed, didn't it?</i>

98
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:58,487
I can smell trouble right
here in this apartment.

99
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:00,115
First you smash your leg,

100
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:03,162
then you get to looking out the window,

101
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,333
see things you shouldn't see.

102
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,295
Trouble.

103
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,174
I can see you in court now

104
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:12,639
surrounded by a bunch of
lawyers in double-breasted suits.

105
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:13,849
You're pleading.

106
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:17,982
You say, "Judge, it was
only a bit of innocent fun."

107
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:20,988
I love my neighbours, like a father."

108
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,325
And the judge says,
'Well, congratulations.

109
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,748
"You've just given birth to
three years in Dannamora."

110
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:29,420
Right now, I'd welcome trouble.

111
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,090
You've got a hormone deficiency.

112
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,843
How can you tell from a thermometer?

113
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,847
Those bathing beauties
you've been watching

114
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:39,439
haven't raised your temperature
one degree in a month.

115
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:43,446
Here we go.

116
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:49,791
One more week.

117
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:55,009
I think you're right.

118
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,221
I think there is gonna
be trouble around here.

119
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:58,807
I knew it.

120
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:02,147
Ooh. Do you ever heat that stuff?

121
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:05,236
Gives your circulation
something to fight.

122
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:08,701
- What kind of trouble?
- Lisa Fremont.

123
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,414
You kidding? She's a
beautiful, young girl,

124
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:14,545
and you're a reasonably
healthy young man.

125
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:17,385
- She expects me to marry her.
- That's normal.

126
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,722
- I don't want to.
- That's abnormal.

127
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:22,268
I'm just not ready for marriage.

128
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:25,566
Every man's ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along.

129
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,363
Lisa Fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain

130
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,907
who can get one eye open.

131
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:31,577
She's alright.

132
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:33,998
- What did you do, have a fight?
- No.

133
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,795
- Father loading up the shotgun?
- What?

134
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,299
- Please, Stella.
- It's happened before, you know.

135
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:42,097
Some of the world's
happiest marriages have

136
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:44,351
started "under the gun",
as you might say.

137
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:47,356
- No, she's just not the girl for me.
- Yeah, she's only perfect.

138
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,610
She's too perfect. She's too talented.

139
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:52,283
She's too beautiful.
She's too sophisticated.

140
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,787
She's too everything, but what I want.

141
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:58,210
Is what you want
something you can discuss?

142
00:11:58,377 --> 00:12:00,548
What? It's very simple, Stella.

143
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:04,305
She belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of Park Avenue:

144
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:07,978
Expensive restaurants and
literary cocktail parties.

145
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,066
People with sense belong
wherever they're put.

146
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:13,072
Can you imagine her tramping
around the world with a camera bum

147
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:15,576
who never has more than a
week's salary in the bank?

148
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,206
If she was only ordinary.

149
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,794
You never gonna get married?

150
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,756
I'll probably get
married one of these days,

151
00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:25,427
but when I do, it's gonna be
to someone who thinks of life

152
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:29,936
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner

153
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:32,273
and the latest scandal.

154
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,613
I need a woman who's
willing to... Hold it.

155
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,621
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

156
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:43,128
So the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off.

157
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,047
Let her find somebody else.

158
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:47,135
Yeah, I can hear you now.

159
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:51,184
"Get out of my life, you
perfectly wonderful woman."

160
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,439
Look, Mr Jefferies, I'm
not an educated woman,

161
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,567
but I can tell you one thing.

162
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,990
When a man and a woman see
each other and like each other,

163
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:01,161
they ought to come together, wham,

164
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:03,165
like a couple of taxis on Broadway

165
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:05,836
and not sit around analysing each other

166
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:07,715
<i>like two specimens in a bottle,</i>

167
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:10,888
There's an intelligent
way to approach marriage.

168
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:12,182
Intelligence.

169
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:16,105
Nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence.

170
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,651
Modern marriage.

171
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:22,618
<i>- No, we've progressed emotionally.
- Baloney,</i>

172
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:27,460
Once it was see somebody,
get excited, get married.

173
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:29,004
Now, it's read a lot of books,

174
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:32,804
<i>fence with a lot of four-syllable
words, psychoanalyse each other</i>

175
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,515
until you can't tell the difference

176
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,771
between a petting party
and a civil service exam.

177
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,569
People have different
emotional levels -

178
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:45,284
<i>When I married Myles, we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits,</i>

179
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:50,795
We are still maladjusted, and
we have loved every minute of it.

180
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,047
Well, that's fine, Stella.

181
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:54,093
Now, would you fix
me a sandwich, please?

182
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,268
Yes, I will. And I'll spread a
little common sense on the bread.

183
00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:01,273
Lisa's loaded to her
fingertips with love for you.

184
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:04,279
I got two words of
advice for you: Marry her.

185
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,117
- She pay you much?
- Oh.

186
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:26,153
There you are.

187
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,578
- Here's the key.
- Thank you.

188
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,350
Well, if you want anything, just ring.

189
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:56,334
Honey.

190
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:58,338
Come on.

191
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:08,565
Got to carry you over the threshold.

192
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,568
Window shopper.

193
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,914
How's your leg?

194
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:26,001
It hurts a little.

195
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:30,134
- And your stomach?
- Empty as a football.

196
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:34,183
And your love life?

197
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,688
Not too active.

198
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:39,151
Anything else bothering you?

199
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:41,322
Mm-hm.

200
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:43,576
Who are you?

201
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,416
<i>Reading from top to bottom:</i>

202
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:49,670
Lisa...

203
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:54,554
Carol...

204
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:00,065
Fremont.

205
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:04,782
Is this the Lisa Fremont who
never wears the same dress twice?

206
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:07,620
Only because it's expected of her.

207
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,832
It's right off the Paris plane.

208
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:13,047
<i>- Do you think it'll sell?
- That depends on the quote,</i>

209
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:15,343
Let's see now. There's
the aeroplane ticket over,

210
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,597
import duties, hidden taxes,

211
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:20,687
<i>- profit markup -
- A steal at $1,100.</i>

212
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:23,191
Eleven hundred?

213
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:25,821
They ought to list that
dress on the stock exchange.

214
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:28,702
We sell a dozen a day
in this price range.

215
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,329
Who buys them, tax collectors?

216
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:32,583
Even if I had to pay,
it would be worth it.

217
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,965
<i>- Just for the occasion.
- Why, is something big going on?</i>

218
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:38,678
It's going on right
here. It's a big night.

219
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:42,268
It's just an old
run-of-the-mill Wednesday.

220
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,896
The calendar's full of them.

221
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,989
It's opening night of the last depressing
week of L B Jefferies in a cast.

222
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:52,788
Well, I haven't noticed
a big demand for tickets.

223
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,752
That's because I bought out the house.

224
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:59,550
You know, this cigarette
box has seen better days.

225
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:03,057
I picked that up in Shanghai,
which has also seen better days.

226
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:05,520
It's cracked and you never use it.

227
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:07,482
It's too ornate.

228
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:11,365
I'm sending up a plain, flat,
silver one with your initials.

229
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:14,119
That's no way to spend
your hard-earned money.

230
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,207
I wanted to.

231
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:18,043
Ooh!

232
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:22,051
What would you think of starting
off with dinner at '21 '?

233
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,972
You have, perhaps, an
ambulance downstairs?

234
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,104
No, better than that: '21 '.

235
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,829
<i>Thank you for waiting, Carl, The
kitchen's right there on the left,</i>

236
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:39,083
I'll take the wine.

237
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:43,215
<i>- Good evening, Mr Jefferies.
- Carl,</i>

238
00:18:43,382 --> 00:18:46,555
Just put everything in
the oven, Carl, on low.

239
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:49,769
<i>- Let's open the wine now.
- Alright,</i>

240
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:52,816
- It's a Montrachet.
- A great big glassful.

241
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:56,114
There's a corkscrew right over there.

242
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:58,201
Here, I'll do it.

243
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,209
- Big enough?
- Yeah, they're fine.

244
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,881
I can't think of anything
more boring or tiresome

245
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:08,429
than what you've been through and
the last week must be the hardest.

246
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:12,896
Alright. Yeah, I want to get
this thing off and get moving.

247
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:17,404
Well, I'm going to make this
a week you'll never forget.

248
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,078
Fine, thanks.

249
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,082
Just a minute, Carl.

250
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:26,003
- This will take care of the taxi.
- Thank you, Miss Fremont.

251
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,887
- Have a pleasant dinner, Mr Jefferies.
- Alright, Good night.

252
00:19:31,054 --> 00:19:32,432
Good night.

253
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,772
What a day I've had.

254
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,360
<i>- Are you tired?
- Not a bit.</i>

255
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,071
I was all morning in a meeting,

256
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:43,744
then I had to dash to the Waldorf
for a quick drink with Madam Dufrene,

257
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:47,377
who's just over from Paris
with some spy reports.

258
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:52,427
<i>Then I had to go to '21' and have
lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people,</i>

259
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:54,431
That's when I ordered dinner.

260
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:57,603
Then I had two fall
showings 20 blocks apart.

261
00:19:57,771 --> 00:19:59,899
Then I had to have a cocktail
with Leland and Slim Hayward.

262
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,862
We're trying to get his new show.

263
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:03,824
Then I had to dash back and change.

264
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:08,416
Well, now, tell me, what
was Mrs Hayward wearing?

265
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,420
- She looked wonderfully cool.
- She didn't, did she?

266
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:13,592
She had on the most divine
Italian hand-printed -

267
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:15,846
- Oh, Italian?
- Oh, you.

268
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:19,561
- Italian. Imagine.
- To think I planted three nice items

269
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:22,025
- in the columns about you today.
- You did?

270
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:25,405
- You can't buy that kind of publicity.
- I know.

271
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:29,413
Someday you may want to open
up a studio of your own here.

272
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,753
How would I run it from, say, Pakistan?

273
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,051
Jeff...

274
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,643
Isn't it time you came home?
You could pick your assignment.

275
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,067
- I wish there was one I wanted.
- Make the one you want.

276
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:46,946
- You mean leave the magazine?
- Yes.

277
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,202
- For what?
- For yourself and me.

278
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:53,291
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow:

279
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,294
Fashions, portraits.

280
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:59,010
- Now, don't laugh. I could do it.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

281
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:02,517
Can you see me driving down
to the fashion salon in a jeep

282
00:21:02,684 --> 00:21:06,816
wearing combat boots and a three-day
beard? Wouldn't that make a hit?

283
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:09,864
I could see you looking
very handsome and successful

284
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,993
in a dark blue, flannel suit.

285
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,374
Let's stop talking nonsense, shall we?

286
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,043
Hm?

287
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:21,552
Guess I'd better start
setting up for dinner.

00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:50,509
<i>♪ Is to love you</i>

311
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:54,809
<i>♪ And you're never out of sight</i>

312
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,524
<i>♪ And I love you</i>

313
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:00,820
<i>♪ And I'll see you</i>

314
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:05,704
<i>♪ In the same old dream</i>

315
00:23:06,706 --> 00:23:09,712
<i>♪ Tonight ♪</i>

316
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:28,289
<i>Miss Lonelyhearts,</i>

317
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:31,712
At least that's something
you'll never have to worry about.

318
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,172
Oh?

319
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:37,096
You can see my apartment from
here, all the way up on 63rd Street?

320
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:40,269
No, not exactly, but we
have a little apartment here

321
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:42,648
that's probably as popular as yours.

322
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:47,240
You remember, of course,
Miss Torso, the ballet dancer?

323
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:51,373
<i>She's like a queen bee
with her pick of the drones,</i>

324
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:02,643
<i>I'd say she's doing
a woman's hardest job,</i>

325
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:04,564
<i>Juggling wolves,</i>

326
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,913
Thank you.

327
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,482
Well, she picked the most
prosperous-looking one.

328
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:30,571
She's not in love with
him... or any of them.

329
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:33,618
Oh, how can you tell that from here?

330
00:24:34,578 --> 00:24:38,670
You said it resembled
my apartment, didn't you?

331
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,286
I hope they're cooked this time.

332
00:26:21,904 --> 00:26:23,949
Where's that wonderful
music coming from?

333
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:27,498
Some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment.

334
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:28,958
Well...

335
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,921
He lives alone.

336
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:34,719
Probably had a very unhappy marriage.

337
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,098
Oh, it's enchanting.

338
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:43,109
It's almost as if it were
being written especially for us.

339
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:46,407
Hm. No wonder he's having
so much trouble with it.

340
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:52,210
At least you can't say
the dinner isn't right.

341
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:56,343
Lisa... it's perfect.

342
00:26:57,971 --> 00:26:59,473
As always.

343
00:27:11,036 --> 00:27:13,917
There can't be that much difference
between people and the way they live.

344
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:16,547
We all eat, talk, drink,
laugh, wear clothes.

345
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:18,091
Well, now look -

346
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:20,680
If you're saying all this because
you don't want to tell me the truth,

347
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,435
because you're hiding something
from me, then maybe I can understand.

348
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:25,230
I'm not hiding anything.
It's just that -

349
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:26,691
It doesn't make sense.

350
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:29,989
What's so different about it
here from there or anyplace you go

351
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:32,577
that one person couldn't live
in both places just as easily?

352
00:27:32,744 --> 00:27:34,246
Some people can. Now,
if you'll just let me -

353
00:27:34,414 --> 00:27:37,377
What is it but travelling from one
place to another taking pictures?

354
00:27:37,544 --> 00:27:39,715
It's like being a tourist
on an endless vacation.

355
00:27:39,882 --> 00:27:42,261
OK. That's your opinion.
You're entitled to it.

356
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,307
- Now, let me give you my side.
- It's ridiculous to say

357
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:48,357
that it can only be done by a special,
private little group of anointed people.

358
00:27:48,524 --> 00:27:51,612
I made a simple statement,
a true statement,

359
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,368
but I can back it up if you'll
just shut up for a minute.

360
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,500
If your opinion is as rude as your
manner, I don't think I care to hear it.

361
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,587
Oh, come on now. Simmer down.

362
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:03,259
I can't fit in here.
You can't fit in there.

363
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:05,471
According to you, people
should be born, live and die

364
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:07,642
- on the same spot!
- Shut up!

365
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:14,738
- Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
- Of course not.

366
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:17,244
Well, you might have
to if you went with me.

367
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:20,917
Did you ever try to keep
warm in a C-54 at 15,000 feet,

368
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:23,171
20 degrees below zero?

369
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:24,883
Oh, I do it all the time,

370
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:26,887
whenever I have a few
minutes after lunch.

371
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:29,016
Did you ever get shot at? Run over?

372
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:30,351
Did you ever get sandbagged

373
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:33,649
because somebody got unfavourable
publicity from your camera?

374
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:36,821
Did you ever... Those high heels,
they'll be great in the jungle.

375
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:38,992
And the nylons and
those six-ounce lingerie.

376
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,871
- Three.
- Alright, three.

377
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,169
They'll make a big hit in Finland,
just before you freeze to death.

378
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:47,884
Well, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to wear the proper clothes.

379
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:49,094
Yeah, yeah.

380
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:52,935
Well, try and find a raincoat in
Brazil, even when it isn't raining.

381
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:56,525
Lisa, in this job you
carry one suitcase.

382
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:59,072
Your home is the
available transportation.

383
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,243
You don't sleep very
much. You bathe less.

384
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:03,580
And sometimes the food that you eat

385
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:06,627
is made from things that you couldn't
even look at when they're alive.

386
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:11,052
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.

387
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:14,141
Deliberately repulsive? I'm
trying to make it sound good.

388
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:17,731
You just have to face it, Lisa, you're
not meant for that kind of a life.

389
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,359
Few people are.

390
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:26,372
- You're too stubborn to argue with.
- I'm not stubborn. I'm just truthful.

391
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:30,046
I know, a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday,

392
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:34,012
and I would have awakened
to a rude disillusionment.

393
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:35,723
Well, now, wait a minute.

394
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:40,189
If you want to get vicious on this
thing, I'd be happy to accommodate you.

395
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:46,452
No, I don't particularly want that.

396
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,665
So that's it?

397
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,087
You won't stay here,
and I can't go with you.

398
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:54,759
It would be the wrong thing.

399
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:59,809
You don't think either one
of us could ever change?

400
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,399
Right now it doesn't seem so.

401
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:09,995
I
- I'm in love with you.

402
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:13,752
I don't care what you do for a living.

403
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,341
I'd like to be part of it somehow.

404
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:21,684
It's deflating to find out the
only way I can be part of it,

405
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,150
is to take out a
subscription to your magazine.

406
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:28,279
I guess I'm not the
girl I thought I was.

407
00:30:29,657 --> 00:30:31,243
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa.

408
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:34,290
You've got this town in
the palm of your hand.

409
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:38,257
Not quite, it seems.

410
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:41,512
Goodbye, Jeff.

411
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,141
You mean good night.

412
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:45,979
<i>- I mean what I said,
- Well, Lisa...</i>

413
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,152
<i>couldn't we just...</i>

414
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,119
Couldn't we just...
keep things status quo?

415
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,210
Without any future?

416
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:00,423
Well, when am I gonna see you again?

417
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:04,848
Not for a long time.

418
00:31:06,434 --> 00:31:10,024
At least... not until tomorrow night.

419
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:15,312
Hey! Rain.

420
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:21,699
Grab that. Wait, I'll get the clock.

421
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:24,120
Oh, no!

422
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:29,171
Pull it.

423
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,264
Pull on it. Let me do it.

424
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,896
In you go.

425
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,527
No, you can't come
in. It's much too late.

426
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:57,823
<i>No, not now,</i>

427
00:34:58,074 --> 00:35:01,121
No, I said good night.

428
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:43,771
What's that supposed to be, ma'am?

429
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:45,899
It's called hunger.

430
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,865
You'd think the rain would
have cooled things off.

431
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:14,244
- All it did was make the heat wet.
- Ahh, that's it.

432
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:16,457
That's stiff right there. Right there.

433
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,920
The insurance company
would be much happier

434
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:22,510
if you'd sleep in bed at night
instead of in that wheelchair.

435
00:37:22,677 --> 00:37:25,098
- How do you know?
- Eyes are all bloodshot.

436
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:27,268
Must have been watching
out that window for hours.

437
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:28,604
Yeah, I was.

438
00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:30,108
What are you gonna do if
one of them catches you?

439
00:37:30,274 --> 00:37:33,447
It depends which one.
Miss Torso, for example -

440
00:37:33,614 --> 00:37:35,492
You keep your mind off her.

441
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:38,373
She sure is the 'eat,
drink and be merry' girl.

442
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,378
Yeah, she'll wind up fat,
alcoholic and miserable.

443
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,006
Yeah.

444
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:46,263
Speaking of misery,
poor Miss Lonelyhearts.

445
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,393
She drank herself to sleep again, alone.

446
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:53,651
Poor soul. Maybe one day
she'll find her happiness.

447
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:56,448
Yeah, and some man will lose his.

448
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:57,909
Isn't there anybody in the neighbourhood

449
00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,955
who could cast an eye in her direction?

450
00:38:00,122 --> 00:38:02,042
Well...

451
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:05,465
It might just be that the
salesman will be available soon.

452
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:07,552
Oh, him and his wife splitting up?

453
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,347
I just can't figure it.

454
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:11,810
He went out several times
last night in the rain,

455
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:15,192
- carrying his sample case.
- Well, he's a salesman, isn't he?

456
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,738
What would he be selling at
three o'clock in the morning?

457
00:38:17,905 --> 00:38:21,244
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches.

458
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:23,916
House numbers that light up.

459
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,628
I don't think so.

460
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:27,339
I don't think so.

461
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:29,927
I think he was taking
something out of the apartment.

462
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:33,851
Uh-huh. His personal effects.

463
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,276
He's gonna run out on her, the coward.

464
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,783
Yeah. Sometimes it's worse
to stay than it is to run.

465
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:48,002
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly
low type of man to do a thing like that.

466
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:49,965
How about this morning?

467
00:38:50,132 --> 00:38:52,094
Any further developments?

468
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:54,765
The shades are all
drawn in the apartment.

469
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,811
- In this heat?
- Yeah.

470
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:59,274
Well, they're up now.

471
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:07,205
- Get back! Get back.
- Where do you want me to go?

472
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:10,252
- Come on, get out of sight.
- What's the matter?

473
00:39:10,419 --> 00:39:12,465
That salesman's looking
out of his window. You see?

474
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,137
Get back! He'll see you.

475
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:17,390
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.

476
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:20,188
<i>That's no ordinary look,</i>

477
00:39:21,398 --> 00:39:23,067
That's the kind of look a man gives

478
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,113
when he's afraid somebody
might be watching him.

479
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:44,566
<i>Get away from there,</i>

480
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:47,071
He'll be after you.
Go on, into the house.

481
00:39:47,238 --> 00:39:49,325
Into the house. Shoo, shoo.

482
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:52,790
Goodbye, Mr Jefferies. See you tomorrow.

483
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,879
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

484
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:06,190
- And don't sleep in that
chair again. - Uh-huh.

485
00:40:06,357 --> 00:40:11,074
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh."
Great conversationalist.

486
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,080
Stella...

487
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:18,546
Take those binoculars out
and bring them here, will you?

488
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:20,258
Trouble.

489
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:22,596
I can smell it.

490
00:40:22,762 --> 00:40:25,768
I'll be glad when they crack that
cast, and I can get outta here.

491
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:27,855
Uh-huh.

492
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:06,680
How far does a girl have to
go before you'll notice her?

493
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:10,645
Well, if she's pretty enough,
she doesn't have to go anywhere.

494
00:44:10,812 --> 00:44:12,858
She just has to 'be. '

495
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,987
Well, ain't I?

496
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:17,283
Pay attention to me.

497
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:23,086
I'm not exactly on the
other side of the room.

498
00:44:23,252 --> 00:44:28,095
Your mind is... and when I
want a man, I want all of him.

499
00:44:32,061 --> 00:44:35,024
Don't you ever have any problems?

500
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:37,320
I have one now.

501
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:39,991
So do I.

502
00:44:40,827 --> 00:44:43,123
Tell me about it.

503
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:46,796
Why?

504
00:44:47,464 --> 00:44:50,887
Why would a man leave
his apartment three times

505
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:55,980
on a rainy night with a suitcase,
and come back three times?

506
00:44:56,147 --> 00:45:00,029
He likes the way his
wife welcomes him home.

507
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:02,826
No, no. Not this salesman's wife.

508
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:04,997
And why didn't he go to work today?

509
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:08,837
Homework. It's more interesting.

510
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:13,512
What's interesting about a butcher knife

511
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,185
and a small saw

512
00:45:16,643 --> 00:45:19,064
wrapped in newspaper?

513
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,194
Nothing, thank heaven.

514
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,283
Why hasn't he been in his
wife's bedroom all day?

515
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,330
I wouldn't dare answer that.

516
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,753
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.

517
00:45:30,921 --> 00:45:34,511
There's something terribly wrong.

518
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:39,853
<i>- And I'm afraid it's with me,
- What do you think?</i>

519
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,988
Something too frightful to utter.

520
00:45:45,155 --> 00:45:48,453
<i>He went out a few minutes ago in
his undershirt, hasn't come back,</i>

521
00:46:02,103 --> 00:46:04,900
<i>That would be a terrible job to tackle,</i>

522
00:46:10,828 --> 00:46:13,499
Just how would you start
to cut up a human body?

523
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:19,970
Jeff, I'll be honest with you.
You're beginning to scare me.

524
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:26,649
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare -

525
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:28,235
Shh! He's coming back!

526
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:59,836
- Jeff, if you could only see yourself!
- What's the matter?

527
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:02,508
Sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing,

528
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:05,179
but doing it the way
you are with binoculars

529
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:09,437
and wild opinions about every
little thing you see is diseased!

530
00:47:09,604 --> 00:47:12,067
Do you think I consider it recreation?

531
00:47:12,234 --> 00:47:14,071
I don't know what you consider it,

532
00:47:14,238 --> 00:47:16,409
but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.

533
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:18,830
- What's the - - What
is it you're looking for?

534
00:47:18,997 --> 00:47:21,626
I just want to find out what's the
matter with the salesman's wife.

535
00:47:21,793 --> 00:47:23,505
Does that make me sound like a madman?

536
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:25,384
What makes you think there's
something the matter with her?

537
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,974
A lot of things. She's an
invalid. She demands constant care.

538
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:34,609
Yet not the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day. Why?

539
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,907
<i>- Maybe she died.
- Where's the doctor?</i>

540
00:47:38,073 --> 00:47:39,285
Where's the undertaker?

541
00:47:39,452 --> 00:47:42,123
She could be sleeping, under sedatives.

542
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,630
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.

543
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,800
There is something. I've
seen it through that window.

544
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,848
I've seen bickering and family quarrels

545
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:52,142
and mysterious trips at night

546
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:54,145
and knives and saws and rope.

547
00:47:54,313 --> 00:47:57,401
Now, since last evening, not a sign
of the wife. Tell me where she is.

548
00:47:57,568 --> 00:47:59,322
- I don't know.
- What's she doing?

549
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:02,578
Maybe he's leaving his wife.
I don't know. I don't care!

550
00:48:02,745 --> 00:48:05,960
Lots of people have knives and
saws and ropes around their houses.

551
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:08,798
And lots of men don't speak
to their wives all day.

552
00:48:08,965 --> 00:48:11,469
Lots of wives nag and men
hate them and trouble starts,

553
00:48:11,637 --> 00:48:15,560
but few of them end up in murder,
if that's what you're thinking.

554
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,065
It's pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word, isn't it?

555
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:20,278
You could see all that
he did, couldn't you?

556
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:22,574
- Of course, I - - You could
see cos the shades were up

557
00:48:22,824 --> 00:48:26,372
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard.

558
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:27,583
I've seen him -

559
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:30,463
Jeff, do you think a murderer
would let you see all that?

560
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,468
That he wouldn't pull the
shades down and hide behind them?

561
00:48:33,636 --> 00:48:35,598
He's being clever.
He's being nonchalant.

562
00:48:35,764 --> 00:48:37,893
And that's where
you're not bring clever.

563
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,358
A murderer would never parade his
crime in front of an open window.

564
00:48:41,525 --> 00:48:42,569
Why not?

565
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:46,159
For all you know, there's
something sinister going on there.

566
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,540
Where? Oh.

567
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:53,298
No comment.

568
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:19,638
Let's start from the
beginning again, Jeff.

569
00:49:19,805 --> 00:49:22,852
Tell me everything you saw

570
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:26,234
and what you think it means.

571
00:49:37,255 --> 00:49:38,966
<i>Yeah?</i>

572
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,593
<i>"The name on the second floor</i>

573
00:49:40,761 --> 00:49:43,891
<i>rear mail box reads, 'Mr and Mrs Lars',"</i>

574
00:49:44,058 --> 00:49:46,522
<i>"That's L-A-R-S,"</i>

575
00:49:46,689 --> 00:49:48,608
<i>"Lars Thorwald,"</i>

576
00:49:48,776 --> 00:49:50,237
What's the number of the apartment?

577
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:54,077
<i>"125 West Ninth Street,"</i>

578
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:55,413
Thank you, dear.

579
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,834
<i>"OK, chief, What's my next assignment?"</i>

580
00:49:58,002 --> 00:50:00,088
Just go home.

581
00:50:00,255 --> 00:50:02,886
<i>"Alright, but what's he doing now?"</i>

582
00:50:03,053 --> 00:50:06,893
He's just sitting in the
living room in the dark.

583
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,648
Hasn't gone near the bedroom.

584
00:50:09,815 --> 00:50:12,695
Now you go home and get
some sleep. Good night.

585
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:14,532
<i>"Good night,"</i>

586
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:24,843
<i>"What's it about, Jeff?"</i>

587
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:28,058
Look, Doyle, I can't
tell you over the phone.

588
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,604
You have to be here and
see the whole set-up.

589
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:35,029
It's probably nothing. It's just
a little neighbourhood murder.

590
00:50:35,196 --> 00:50:38,243
<i>- 'Did you say murder?'
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.</i>

591
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,537
<i>"Oh, come now,"</i>

592
00:50:39,705 --> 00:50:42,292
My only thought was throwing a
little business your way, that's all.

593
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:45,757
I figured a detective would jump at
the chance of something to detect.

594
00:50:45,924 --> 00:50:47,635
<i>- "I'm not working,"
- What?</i>

595
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:49,139
<i>"This happens to be my day off,"</i>

596
00:50:49,305 --> 00:50:52,185
I usually took my best
pictures on my day off.

597
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:56,068
<i>- "I'll drop by,"
- OK, Doyle. As soon as you can.</i>

598
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,450
Bless your heart, Stella.

599
00:50:59,616 --> 00:51:01,286
Gee whiz, look at this.

600
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:03,832
I can't tell you what
a welcome sight this is.

601
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,461
No wonder your husband still loves you.

602
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:07,088
- The police.
- What?

603
00:51:07,255 --> 00:51:10,428
- You called the police.
- Well, not exactly.

604
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:13,893
Not an official call.
It's an old friend of mine.

605
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,149
An old, ornery friend of mine.

606
00:51:17,316 --> 00:51:21,574
Just where do you suppose he cut her up?

607
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:25,122
Of course. The bathtub.

608
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:30,423
That's the only place where he
could have washed away the blood.

609
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:42,977
He better get that trunk out of
there before it starts to leak.

610
00:52:03,312 --> 00:52:05,901
<i>Harry?</i>

611
00:52:10,035 --> 00:52:11,831
<i>Look, look, Mr Jefferies,</i>

612
00:52:49,955 --> 00:52:52,126
I thought Doyle would be here
by the time the trunk left,

613
00:52:52,293 --> 00:52:54,590
or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.

614
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:56,469
- Hold everything.
- Don't do anything foolish.

615
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:58,306
I'm just gonna get the
name off that freight truck.

616
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:01,229
I'll keep an eye on the alley.

617
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:15,677
Long distance.

618
00:53:41,023 --> 00:53:44,489
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?

619
00:53:44,657 --> 00:53:47,621
Because everything this fellow's
done has been suspicious:

620
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:51,295
Trips at night in the rain, knives
and saws and trunks with rope,

621
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:53,550
and now this wife that
isn't there any more.

622
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:56,473
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.

623
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,357
It could be any number of things.
Murder's the least possible.

624
00:54:00,524 --> 00:54:02,486
Doyle, don't tell me he's
an unemployed magician,

625
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:04,491
amusing the neighbourhood
with his sleight of hand.

626
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:05,743
Don't tell me that.

627
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,040
It's too obvious and stupid
a way to commit murder.

628
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:09,919
In full view of 50 windows?

629
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:12,591
Then sit there smoking a cigar,
waiting for the police to pick him up.

630
00:54:12,758 --> 00:54:15,389
Alright, officer, do your
duty. Go over and pick him up.

631
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:18,730
Jeff, you've got a lot
to learn about homicide.

632
00:54:18,896 --> 00:54:20,775
Why, morons have committed
murder so shrewdly,

633
00:54:20,943 --> 00:54:24,326
it's taken a hundred trained
police minds to catch them.

634
00:54:24,492 --> 00:54:26,788
That salesman wouldn't just
knock his wife off after dinner

635
00:54:26,956 --> 00:54:29,461
and toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage.

636
00:54:29,837 --> 00:54:31,089
I'll bet it's been done.

637
00:54:31,257 --> 00:54:34,555
Most everything's been
done... under panic.

638
00:54:34,723 --> 00:54:36,477
This is a
thousand-to-one shot.

639
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:39,399
He's still sitting around the
apartment. That man's not panicked.

640
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,155
You think I made all this up?

641
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:44,117
Well, I think you saw something

642
00:54:44,285 --> 00:54:46,748
there's probably a very
simple explanation for.

643
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:49,797
- For instance?
- Wife took a trip.

644
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,801
His wife was sick in bed.

645
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:55,976
Yeah, so you told me.

646
00:54:56,978 --> 00:54:59,526
Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.

647
00:55:00,987 --> 00:55:05,998
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.

648
00:55:06,165 --> 00:55:08,754
No sense in your getting a
lot of ridiculous publicity.

649
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:10,258
Thank you.

650
00:55:12,722 --> 00:55:15,519
We know the wife is gone, so
I'll see if I can find out where.

651
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:17,064
Do that.

652
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:20,320
You had any headaches lately?

653
00:55:20,488 --> 00:55:21,866
Not till you showed up.

654
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:25,958
It will wear off, along
with the hallucinations.

655
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,335
See you around.

656
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,856
Get along.

657
00:56:15,066 --> 00:56:16,235
He has a six months' lease.

658
00:56:16,402 --> 00:56:19,324
Used up a little more than
five and a half months of it.

659
00:56:19,492 --> 00:56:21,871
He's quiet, drinks,
but not to drunkenness.

660
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:23,667
Pays his bills promptly
with money earned

661
00:56:23,835 --> 00:56:26,591
as a costume jewellery
salesman: Wholesale.

662
00:56:26,757 --> 00:56:29,722
Kept to himself. No neighbours
got close to him or his wife.

663
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:31,642
Yeah, well, I think they
missed their chance with her.

664
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:34,691
She never left the apartment,
until yesterday morning.

665
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,112
- What time?
- 6:00am.

666
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,409
6:00am.

667
00:56:39,576 --> 00:56:42,540
I think that's about
the time I fell asleep.

668
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:44,044
Too bad.

669
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:48,219
Thorwalds were leaving their
apartment at just that time.

670
00:56:49,055 --> 00:56:51,225
Feel a little foolish?

671
00:56:51,392 --> 00:56:53,481
No, not yet.

672
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:08,095
- How's your wife?
- Oh, she's fine.

673
00:57:11,477 --> 00:57:12,771
Who said they left then?

674
00:57:14,024 --> 00:57:16,989
<i>- W-Who left where? -
The Thorwalds, at 6:00am,</i>

675
00:57:17,155 --> 00:57:19,953
Oh, the building
superintendent and two tenants.

676
00:57:20,121 --> 00:57:22,960
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.

677
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:25,549
Thorwalds were on their
way to the railroad station.

678
00:57:25,716 --> 00:57:29,056
Well, now, Tom, how could
anybody possibly guess that?

679
00:57:29,223 --> 00:57:31,019
What, did they have signs
on their luggage saying,

680
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:32,479
'Grand Central, or bust'?

681
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,155
The superintendent met
Thorwald on his way back.

682
00:57:36,321 --> 00:57:39,327
Thorwald told him that he'd put
his wife on a train to the country.

683
00:57:39,494 --> 00:57:42,501
I see. I'd say this is a pretty
convenient guy, this superintendent.

684
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,964
Have you checked his
bank statements lately?

685
00:57:46,927 --> 00:57:50,560
- Huh?
- Well, what good's his information?

686
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:54,777
It's a secondhand version of an
unsupported story by the murderer.

687
00:57:54,944 --> 00:57:58,535
Now did anybody actually see
the wife get on the train?

688
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:00,414
I hate to remind you,

689
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,585
but this all started because
you said she was murdered.

690
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:06,009
<i>Now, did anyone, including
you, actually see her murdered?</i>

691
00:58:06,176 --> 00:58:08,222
What are you doing?

692
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:11,771
Are you interested in solving this
case or making me look foolish?

693
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:14,485
Well, if possible, both.

694
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:16,365
Then do a good job of it.

695
00:58:16,532 --> 00:58:18,285
Go over there and search
Thorwald's apartment.

696
00:58:18,452 --> 00:58:19,956
It must be knee-deep in evidence.

697
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,631
I can't do that.

698
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:24,262
<i>I don't mean right now, but
when he goes out for a drink,</i>

699
00:58:24,429 --> 00:58:26,601
<i>or a paper, or something, What
he doesn't know won't hurt him,</i>

700
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:28,521
I can't do that even if he isn't there.

701
00:58:28,688 --> 00:58:30,942
What's he...

702
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,740
Does he have a courtesy card from
the police department or something?

703
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:35,912
Now don't get me mad.

704
00:58:36,078 --> 00:58:39,209
Not even a detective can walk
into an apartment and search it.

705
00:58:39,376 --> 00:58:42,341
If I were caught in there, they'd
have my badge within ten minutes.

706
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:44,679
<i>Make sure you don't
get caught, that's all,</i>

707
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,560
If you find something,
you've got a murderer,

708
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:49,272
and they don't care about
a couple of house rules.

709
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:51,443
If you don't find anything,
the fellow's clear.

710
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,657
At the risk of sounding stuffy,

711
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:57,373
I'd like to remind you of the
Constitution and the phrase,

712
00:58:57,539 --> 00:59:01,088
<i>'search warrant issued by a judge'
who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim,</i>

713
00:59:01,255 --> 00:59:04,679
<i>- He must ask for evidence,
- Give him evidence.</i>

714
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:08,144
Yeah, I can hear myself,

715
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:13,364
"Your Honour, I have a friend
who's an amateur sleuth."

716
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:16,704
"The other night, after
having a heavy dinner, he..."

717
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:19,835
He'd throw the New York
State penal code in my face,

718
00:59:20,003 --> 00:59:21,171
and there's six volumes.

719
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:25,054
By tomorrow morning there
may not be any evidence left

720
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:26,933
over in that apartment, you know that.

721
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:28,655
It's a detective's nightmare.

722
00:59:28,822 --> 00:59:32,205
What do you need before you can search?

723
00:59:32,371 --> 00:59:33,665
Tell me now, what do you need?

724
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:35,962
Bloody footsteps leading up to the door?

725
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:39,929
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.

726
00:59:40,097 --> 00:59:43,228
Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.

727
00:59:43,394 --> 00:59:45,399
How did we ever stand
each other in that plane

728
00:59:45,566 --> 00:59:46,819
for three years during the war?

729
00:59:49,533 --> 00:59:51,161
I guess I'll go over
to the railroad station

730
00:59:51,328 --> 00:59:52,915
and check on Thorwald's story.

731
00:59:53,082 --> 00:59:54,377
<i>Oh, forget about the story,</i>

732
00:59:54,544 --> 00:59:56,882
Find the trunk. Mrs Thorwald's in it.

733
00:59:57,634 --> 00:59:59,011
Oh, I almost forgot.

734
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:02,812
There was a postcard in
Thorwald's mailbox. It was...

735
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:05,609
<i>mailed 3:30 yesterday
afternoon from Merritsville,</i>

736
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:07,363
<i>That's 80 miles north of here,</i>

737
01:00:07,947 --> 01:00:09,952
Message went: 'Arrived OK.

738
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:14,420
Already feeling better. Love, Anna. '

739
01:00:15,965 --> 01:00:19,180
Uh... is that, um...

740
01:00:19,346 --> 01:00:21,894
Anna... Is that who I think it is?

741
01:00:23,272 --> 01:00:25,903
- Mrs Thorwald.
- Uh-huh.

742
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:30,037
Oh, so anything you need, Jeff?

743
01:00:30,788 --> 01:00:32,626
You might send me a good detective.

744
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:35,931
- Oh, by the way, where's the gin?
- I'll get the gin.

745
01:02:43,364 --> 01:02:46,537
Much faster, and swing the left arm up.

01:04:08,254 --> 01:04:10,926
<i>♪ Many dreams</i>

770
01:04:11,093 --> 01:04:12,888
<i>♪ Ago</i>

771
01:04:20,948 --> 01:04:23,327
<i>- "Hello? Yes?"
- Hello, Miss Doyle?</i>

772
01:04:23,494 --> 01:04:25,248
This is Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?

773
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:26,188
<i>"Not yet, Jeff,"</i>

774
01:04:26,223 --> 01:04:28,102
You mean you haven't
even heard from him?

775
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:31,736
<i>"Not a word, Is it something
really important, Jeff?"</i>

776
01:04:31,903 --> 01:04:33,573
Yeah, I'm afraid it is.

777
01:04:33,741 --> 01:04:35,495
<i>"I'll have him call the
moment I hear from him,"</i>

778
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:37,207
No, no, don't bother to do that.

779
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,754
Just have him get over
here as soon as he can.

780
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:41,592
Looks like Thorwald's
pulling out tonight.

781
01:04:41,759 --> 01:04:43,889
<i>- " Who's Thorwald?"
- He'll know, he'll know.</i>

782
01:04:44,056 --> 01:04:46,436
And Thorwald's a man, don't worry.

783
01:04:46,603 --> 01:04:50,153
<i>- "Good night, you idiot,"
- Good night.</i>

784
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:07,192
Long distance again.

785
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:48,870
<i>There's somebody at the door,</i>

786
01:05:50,165 --> 01:05:52,379
- Hi.
- Hello.

787
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,473
Hello.

788
01:06:18,646 --> 01:06:20,485
- What'd you do to your
hair? - Oh, I just -

789
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:23,825
Take a look at Thorwald. He's
getting ready to pull out.

790
01:06:28,503 --> 01:06:30,048
He doesn't seem to be in any hurry.

791
01:06:30,215 --> 01:06:32,763
He's been laying out all his
things on one of the beds:

792
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:35,101
Shirts, suits, coats, socks.

793
01:06:35,268 --> 01:06:39,653
Even that alligator handbag
his wife left on the bedpost.

794
01:06:39,709 --> 01:06:42,466
He had it hidden in the
dresser. At least, it was there.

795
01:06:42,633 --> 01:06:46,475
He took it out, went to the telephone
and made a long distance call.

796
01:06:46,642 --> 01:06:49,315
He had his wife's
jewellery in the handbag.

797
01:06:49,482 --> 01:06:52,406
Seemed worried about it. Asked
someone's advice over the phone.

798
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:54,160
Someone not his wife.

799
01:06:54,326 --> 01:06:56,081
Well, I never saw him
ask her for advice.

800
01:06:56,248 --> 01:06:59,798
She volunteered plenty, but I
never saw him ask her for any.

801
01:07:10,323 --> 01:07:13,747
- I wonder where he's going.
- I don't know.

802
01:07:14,165 --> 01:07:19,552
- Suppose he doesn't come back?
- He'll be back. His things are there.

803
01:07:19,719 --> 01:07:22,810
- I guess it's safe to put on lights.
- No, not yet!

804
01:07:30,244 --> 01:07:35,548
OK, you can turn it on now. He must
have gone someplace to the right.

805
01:07:35,714 --> 01:07:39,056
All day long, I've been trying
to keep my mind on my work.

806
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:43,483
<i>- Thinking about Thorwald?
- And you, and your friend, Doyle.</i>

807
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:46,782
<i>- Did you hear from him since he left?
- Not a word,</i>

808
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:49,329
<i>He said he was gonna check the
railroad station and the trunk,</i>

809
01:07:49,497 --> 01:07:51,209
He must be still at it.

810
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,466
Something on your mind?

811
01:07:54,633 --> 01:07:58,100
- It doesn't make sense to me.
- What doesn't?

812
01:07:58,267 --> 01:08:00,982
Women aren't that unpredictable.

813
01:08:01,149 --> 01:08:05,241
Hmm. Well, I can't guess
what you're thinking.

814
01:08:05,409 --> 01:08:07,915
A woman has a favourite handbag,

815
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:12,133
and it always hangs on her bedpost
where she can get at it easily.

816
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:16,059
Then, all of a sudden, she goes away
on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?

817
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:17,938
Because she didn't know
she was going on a trip,

818
01:08:18,104 --> 01:08:20,026
and where she's going, she
wouldn't need the handbag.

819
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:24,118
Yes, but only her
husband would know that.

820
01:08:24,286 --> 01:08:27,252
And that jewellery
- Women don't keep their jewellery in a purse

821
01:08:27,418 --> 01:08:29,840
getting all twisted and
scratched and tangled up.

822
01:08:30,007 --> 01:08:31,594
Well, do they hide it in
their husband's clothes?

823
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:35,771
They do not. And they don't
leave it behind either.

824
01:08:36,398 --> 01:08:38,611
Why, a woman going
anywhere but the hospital

825
01:08:38,778 --> 01:08:43,037
would always take make-up,
perfume and jewellery.

826
01:08:43,205 --> 01:08:45,042
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?

827
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:46,629
It's basic equipment.

828
01:08:46,796 --> 01:08:49,803
And you don't leave it behind
in your husband's drawer

829
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:51,349
in your favourite handbag.

830
01:08:51,516 --> 01:08:53,771
Well, I'm with you,
sweetie. I'm with you.

831
01:08:53,954 --> 01:08:55,791
Tom Doyle has a pat
answer for that though.

832
01:08:55,959 --> 01:08:58,465
That Mrs Thorwald left at 6:00am
yesterday with her husband?

833
01:08:58,632 --> 01:08:59,676
According to those witnesses.

834
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,100
Well, I have a pat
rebuttal for Mr Doyle.

835
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:06,609
Couldn't have been Mrs
Thorwald, or I don't know women.

836
01:09:06,984 --> 01:09:11,788
- What about the witnesses?
- We'll agree they saw a woman,

837
01:09:11,955 --> 01:09:14,543
but she was not Mrs Thorwald.

838
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:18,135
- That is, not yet.
- Is that so?

839
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:24,066
Come here.

840
01:09:27,115 --> 01:09:30,247
I'd like to see your friend's
face when we tell him.

841
01:09:30,414 --> 01:09:32,585
He doesn't sound like
much of a detective.

842
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:37,639
Oh, don't be too hard on
him. He's a steady worker.

843
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:39,518
I sure wish he'd show up.

844
01:09:39,685 --> 01:09:42,692
Don't rush him. We have all night.

845
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,579
- We have all what?
- Night.

846
01:09:47,746 --> 01:09:50,251
I'm going to stay with you.

847
01:09:51,671 --> 01:09:55,765
Well, you'll have to clear
that with my landlord.

848
01:09:55,931 --> 01:09:58,562
I have the whole weekend off.

849
01:09:59,189 --> 01:10:02,279
That's very nice, but
I just have one bed.

850
01:10:02,906 --> 01:10:07,208
If you say anything else,
I'll... stay tomorrow night too.

851
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:11,677
I won't be able to
give you any... pyjamas.

852
01:10:15,852 --> 01:10:20,029
You said I'll have to
live out of one suitcase.

853
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:25,165
- I'll bet yours isn't this small.
- This is a suitcase?

854
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:28,214
Well, a Mark Cross overnight case.

855
01:10:28,382 --> 01:10:31,681
- Ooh.
- Compact, but, uh... ample enough.

856
01:10:31,848 --> 01:10:34,019
Looks like you packed in a hurry.

857
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:37,402
Look at this. Isn't that amazing?

858
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:42,247
I'll trade you... my feminine
intuition for a bed for the night.

859
01:10:42,414 --> 01:10:44,961
I'll go along with that.

860
01:10:58,326 --> 01:10:59,829
There's that song again.

861
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:10,772
Where does a man get inspiration
to write a song like that?

862
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:14,948
Well, he gets it from
the landlady once a month.

863
01:11:16,911 --> 01:11:19,708
It's utterly beautiful.

864
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:23,551
- I wish I could be creative.
- Oh, sweetie, you are.

865
01:11:23,718 --> 01:11:27,561
Y- Y-You have a great talent for
creating difficult situations.

866
01:11:27,727 --> 01:11:29,398
- I do?
- Sure.

867
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:31,444
Like staying here all night uninvited.

868
01:11:31,611 --> 01:11:34,869
Well, surprise is the most
important element of attack.

869
01:11:35,052 --> 01:11:38,226
Besides, you're not up on
your private eye literature.

870
01:11:38,393 --> 01:11:40,356
When they're in trouble,
it's always their Girl Friday

871
01:11:40,523 --> 01:11:41,818
that gets them out of it.

872
01:11:41,985 --> 01:11:44,073
Is she the girl that saves
them from the clutches

873
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,957
of the over-passionate
daughters of the rich?

874
01:11:48,124 --> 01:11:51,006
- The same.
- That's the one, huh?

875
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:54,096
It's funny. He never ends
up marrying her, does he?

876
01:11:54,263 --> 01:11:56,937
<i>- That's strange,
- Weird.</i>

877
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,279
Why don't I slip into
something more comfortable?

878
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:02,951
By all means.

879
01:12:03,409 --> 01:12:06,375
I mean, like the kitchen
and make us some coffee.

880
01:12:06,542 --> 01:12:09,131
Oh, and some brandy too, huh?

881
01:12:18,988 --> 01:12:20,575
<i>Harry,</i>

882
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,308
- Jeff.
- Hi.

883
01:13:23,344 --> 01:13:24,806
What else have you got
on this man Thorwald?

884
01:13:24,973 --> 01:13:28,189
Enough to scare me you wouldn't
show up in time and we'd lose him.

885
01:13:28,773 --> 01:13:30,945
- Think he's getting out of here?
- He's got everything he owns

886
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:35,414
laid out over there in the
bedroom, waiting to be packed.

887
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:40,258
I'm just warming some
brandy. Mr Doyle, I presume?

888
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:45,312
<i>Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont,</i>

889
01:13:45,479 --> 01:13:48,862
- How do you do?
- We think Thorwald's guilty.

890
01:13:56,253 --> 01:13:58,133
Careful, Tom.

891
01:14:03,103 --> 01:14:04,356
<i>- Hello.
- Lieutenant doyle,</i>

892
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,026
Yeah, he's right here. For you.

893
01:14:07,823 --> 01:14:09,827
<i>- Hello.
- Lieutenant doyle, sir?</i>

894
01:14:09,993 --> 01:14:13,126
Speaking. Yeah.

895
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:16,969
Alright.

896
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:20,018
I see. Thank you... Goodbye.

897
01:14:20,117 --> 01:14:22,206
Coffee will be ready soon.

898
01:14:22,373 --> 01:14:24,711
Jeff, aren't you going to
tell him about the jewellery?

899
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:25,923
Jewellery?

900
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:29,473
He's got his wife's jewellery hidden
in his clothes in the bedroom there.

901
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,772
- You sure it belonged to his wife?
- It was in her favourite handbag.

902
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:35,612
Mr Doyle, that can only
lead to one conclusion.

903
01:14:35,779 --> 01:14:36,823
Namely?

904
01:14:36,991 --> 01:14:40,540
That it was not Mrs Thorwald that
left with him yesterday morning.

905
01:14:40,749 --> 01:14:42,211
You figured that out, eh?

906
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:44,842
It's simply that women don't
leave their jewellery behind

907
01:14:45,009 --> 01:14:47,305
when they go on a trip.

908
01:14:47,473 --> 01:14:52,569
Come on, Tom. You don't really need
any of this information, do you?

909
01:14:57,956 --> 01:15:00,628
As a matter of fact, I don't.

910
01:15:06,059 --> 01:15:10,193
Lars Thorwald is no more
a murderer than I am.

911
01:15:13,283 --> 01:15:17,168
You can explain everything
that's going on over there?

912
01:15:17,377 --> 01:15:19,297
<i>No, and neither can you.</i>

913
01:15:19,465 --> 01:15:22,304
That's a secret, private world
you're looking into out there.

914
01:15:22,472 --> 01:15:24,894
People do a lot of things in
private they couldn't do in public.

915
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:27,191
Like disposing of their wives?

916
01:15:27,525 --> 01:15:30,281
Get that idea out of your mind. It'll
only lead in the wrong direction.

917
01:15:30,448 --> 01:15:32,203
What about the knife and the saw?

918
01:15:32,913 --> 01:15:37,131
- Did you ever own a saw? - Well,
at home in the garage I had -

919
01:15:37,298 --> 01:15:39,344
<i>How many people did you cut up with it?</i>

920
01:15:39,637 --> 01:15:44,691
Or with the couple hundred knives
you've owned in your lifetime?

921
01:15:44,858 --> 01:15:46,361
Your logic is backward.

922
01:15:46,528 --> 01:15:50,203
You can't ignore the disappearance
and the trunk and the jewellery.

923
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:53,210
I checked the railroad
station. He bought a ticket.

924
01:15:53,377 --> 01:15:55,215
Ten minutes later, he
put his wife on the train.

925
01:15:55,243 --> 01:15:58,418
Destination: Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.

926
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:01,550
That might have been a woman, but
it couldn't have been Mrs Thorwald.

927
01:16:01,717 --> 01:16:03,095
- That jewellery -
- Look, Miss Fremont.

928
01:16:03,262 --> 01:16:06,019
That feminine intuition
stuff sells magazines

929
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:09,027
but in real life, it's
still a fairy tale.

930
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:10,530
I don't know how many
wasted years I've spent,

931
01:16:10,697 --> 01:16:13,579
tracking down leads
based on female intuition.

932
01:16:13,746 --> 01:16:16,252
<i>Alright! I take it you
didn't find the trunk,</i>

933
01:16:16,419 --> 01:16:19,594
All this is from an old speech
you made at the policemen's ball.

934
01:16:19,761 --> 01:16:22,309
I found the trunk a
half-hour after I left here.

935
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:26,486
I suppose it's normal for a man
to tie up a trunk with heavy rope?

936
01:16:26,653 --> 01:16:28,156
If the lock is broken, yes.

937
01:16:28,323 --> 01:16:31,581
What did you find inside the
trunk, a surly note to me?

938
01:16:31,748 --> 01:16:33,753
Mrs Thorwald's clothes;

939
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,136
Clean, well-packed, not
stylish, but presentable.

940
01:16:37,303 --> 01:16:39,058
Didn't you take them
off to the crime lab?

941
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:42,065
I sent them on their
merry and legal way.

942
01:16:42,232 --> 01:16:44,905
Why, when a woman is
taking a simple, short trip,

943
01:16:45,072 --> 01:16:46,994
does she take everything she owns?

944
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,462
Let's let the female psychology
department handle that one.

945
01:16:51,629 --> 01:16:54,052
I would say it looked as
if she wasn't coming back.

946
01:16:54,219 --> 01:16:56,016
That's what's known as a family problem.

947
01:16:56,182 --> 01:16:58,731
If she wasn't coming back, why
didn't he tell his landlord?

948
01:16:58,897 --> 01:17:00,735
I'll tell you why he
didn't tell his landlord,

949
01:17:00,902 --> 01:17:02,113
because he was hiding something.

950
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,585
Do you tell your landlord everything?

951
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:10,050
Ah, I told you to be careful, Tom.

952
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:13,391
If I'd have been careful
piloting that reconnaissance plane

953
01:17:13,558 --> 01:17:14,853
you wouldn't have had the
chance to take the pictures

954
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:19,405
that won you a medal, and a
good job, and fame, and money.

955
01:17:21,619 --> 01:17:26,757
What do you say, we all sit down
and have a nice friendly drink.

956
01:17:26,924 --> 01:17:29,388
Forget all about this.

957
01:17:29,555 --> 01:17:34,024
We can tell lies about the
good old days during the war.

958
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:36,162
You mean you're through with the case?

959
01:17:36,329 --> 01:17:39,169
There is no case to be
through with, Miss Fremont.

960
01:17:39,336 --> 01:17:40,882
How about that drink?

961
01:17:48,693 --> 01:17:50,613
Yeah, I guess you're right.

962
01:17:52,243 --> 01:17:56,210
Well, I think I better get
home and get some sleep.

963
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,009
Cheers.

964
01:18:01,766 --> 01:18:05,441
I, uh... I'm not much of a snifter.

965
01:18:09,911 --> 01:18:12,458
Oh, Jeff, if you need any more help...

966
01:18:12,626 --> 01:18:16,259
consult the Yellow Pages
in your telephone directory.

967
01:18:17,011 --> 01:18:20,018
Oh, I love funny exiting lines.

968
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,568
- Who was that trunk addressed to?
- Mrs Anna Thorwald.

969
01:18:23,735 --> 01:18:25,782
Then let's wait and
find out who picks it up.

970
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:28,790
Oh, that phone call, I
gave them your number.

971
01:18:28,957 --> 01:18:31,672
- I hope you don't mind.
- Depends on who they were.

972
01:18:31,839 --> 01:18:33,425
The police at Merritsville.

973
01:18:33,593 --> 01:18:35,723
They reported the trunk
was just picked up...

974
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:37,519
by Mrs Anna Thorwald.

975
01:18:38,856 --> 01:18:40,944
Don't stay up too late.

976
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:01,619
- Look.
- What?

977
01:19:33,613 --> 01:19:37,289
<i>Yeah, he's kind of young, isn't he?</i>

978
01:20:12,248 --> 01:20:14,087
What are you doing?

979
01:20:17,469 --> 01:20:20,811
<i>♪ Or just a cold and lonely</i>

980
01:20:21,814 --> 01:20:26,324
<i>♪ Lovely work of art ♪ -</i>

981
01:20:40,191 --> 01:20:44,618
You know, much as I hate to give
Thomas J Doyle too much credit,

982
01:20:44,785 --> 01:20:46,957
he might have gotten ahold
of something when he said

983
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:51,259
that was pretty private
stuff going on out there.

984
01:20:52,095 --> 01:20:54,517
<i>I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man</i>

985
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:58,068
<i>with binoculars and a long-focus lens,</i>

986
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:00,449
Do you...

987
01:21:00,616 --> 01:21:04,625
Do you suppose it's ethical, even if
you prove that he didn't commit a crime?

988
01:21:06,923 --> 01:21:08,969
I'm not much on rear window ethics.

989
01:21:09,596 --> 01:21:11,016
Of course, they can do
the same thing to me,

990
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:13,772
watch me like a bug under
a glass, if they want to.

991
01:21:14,733 --> 01:21:18,200
Jeff, if someone came in here, they
wouldn't believe what they'd see.

992
01:21:18,367 --> 01:21:20,747
<i>- What?
- You and me with long faces,</i>

993
01:21:20,915 --> 01:21:25,300
plunged into despair because we
find out a man didn't kill his wife.

994
01:21:25,467 --> 01:21:28,767
We're two of the most frightening
ghouls I've ever known.

995
01:21:28,934 --> 01:21:34,740
You'd think we could be a bit happy
that the poor woman is alive and well.

996
01:21:36,578 --> 01:21:41,381
Whatever happened to that old
saying, 'Love thy neighbour'?

997
01:21:41,548 --> 01:21:45,390
You know, I think I'll
start reviving that tomorrow.

998
01:21:46,185 --> 01:21:48,565
Yeah, I'll begin with Miss Torso.

999
01:21:49,093 --> 01:21:52,476
Not if I have to move into
an apartment across the way...

1000
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:58,659
and do the 'Dance of the
Seven Veils' every hour.

1001
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:03,046
Show's over for tonight.

1002
01:22:07,767 --> 01:22:10,858
Preview of coming attractions.

1003
01:22:12,446 --> 01:22:14,911
Did Mr Doyle think I stole this case?

1004
01:22:16,874 --> 01:22:19,339
No, Lisa, I don't think he did.

1005
01:22:34,378 --> 01:22:38,389
<i>- What do you think?
- Well, uh...</i>

1006
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:42,399
<i>- I will rephrase the question.
- Thank you,</i>

1007
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:44,864
Do you like it?

1008
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:47,621
- Yes, I like
it. - Well -

1009
01:22:58,984 --> 01:23:01,072
What's the matter?

1010
01:23:02,869 --> 01:23:05,167
<i>- Somebody's hurt?
- It's the dog,</i>

1011
01:23:05,334 --> 01:23:07,925
Something's happened to the dog.

1012
01:23:11,516 --> 01:23:13,564
<i>Somebody fall out a window?</i>

1013
01:23:14,734 --> 01:23:16,404
I think it's a dog.

1014
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:21,627
It's dead. It's been
strangled. Its neck is broken.

1015
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,094
Which one of you did it?

1016
01:23:25,262 --> 01:23:27,183
Which one of you killed my dog?

1017
01:23:27,935 --> 01:23:31,736
You don't know the meaning
of the word 'neighbours'.

1018
01:23:32,488 --> 01:23:33,909
<i>Neighbours like each other,</i>

1019
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:38,421
speak to each other, care
if anybody lives or dies!

1020
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:41,177
<i>But none of you do!</i>

1021
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,695
But I couldn't imagine
any of you being so low

1022
01:23:47,862 --> 01:23:50,870
that you'd kill a
helpless, friendly dog.

1023
01:23:53,251 --> 01:23:58,014
The only thing in this whole
neighbourhood who liked anybody!

1024
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:10,128
<i>Did you kill him because he liked
you? Just because he liked you?</i>

1025
01:24:13,513 --> 01:24:15,810
Let's go inside.

1026
01:24:19,277 --> 01:24:21,199
- Come on. Let's go back in.
- It's only a dog.

1027
01:24:34,094 --> 01:24:36,141
You know, for a minute,
that Tom Doyle almost had me

1028
01:24:36,309 --> 01:24:38,189
convinced I was wrong.

1029
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,027
- But you're not?
- Look.

1030
01:24:40,194 --> 01:24:45,166
In the courtyard, only one person
didn't come to the window. Look.

1031
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:55,192
Why would Thorwald want
to kill a little dog?

1032
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:58,743
Because it knew too much?

1033
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,562
You think this is worth
waiting all day to see?

1034
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:11,403
<i>Is he cleaning house?</i>

1035
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:13,951
He's washing down the bathroom walls.

1036
01:25:14,619 --> 01:25:17,461
Hm, must have splattered a lot.

1037
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:21,638
Well, why not? That's
what we're all thinking.

1038
01:25:21,805 --> 01:25:24,897
He killed her in there, he
has to clean up those stains.

1039
01:25:25,065 --> 01:25:27,320
Oh, Stella, your choice of words.

1040
01:25:27,488 --> 01:25:32,166
<i>Nobody ever invented a
polite word for a killing yet,</i>

1041
01:25:34,047 --> 01:25:38,976
Lisa, back there on that shelf,
there's a little yellow box, you see it?

1042
01:25:39,143 --> 01:25:41,065
- Top one?
- Right on top, yeah.

1043
01:25:41,233 --> 01:25:43,488
And bring me the viewer there.

1044
01:25:45,536 --> 01:25:49,505
I just got a... These
are about two weeks old.

1045
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,268
I hope I took something else
besides leg art. Now which one...

1046
01:25:54,435 --> 01:25:56,733
What are you looking for?

1047
01:25:57,317 --> 01:26:00,367
There's something, and if I'm
right, I think I've solved a murder.

1048
01:26:00,534 --> 01:26:02,623
- Mrs Thorwald?
- No.

1049
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:05,464
No, the dog.

1050
01:26:06,968 --> 01:26:11,354
Uh-huh. I think I know why
Thorwald killed that dog.

1051
01:26:11,521 --> 01:26:14,362
Here, now you take a
look. Tell me what you see.

1052
01:26:14,989 --> 01:26:16,827
<i>Now take it down,</i>

1053
01:26:16,995 --> 01:26:18,792
<i>Now look again,</i>

1054
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:20,838
<i>Now take it down, You see?</i>

1055
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,431
It's just a picture of the backyard -

1056
01:26:24,598 --> 01:26:29,111
But with one important
change. One important change.

1057
01:26:29,277 --> 01:26:33,288
Those flowers in
Thorwald's pet flower bed.

1058
01:26:33,324 --> 01:26:35,497
You mean where the dog
was sniffing around?

1059
01:26:35,664 --> 01:26:39,132
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.

1060
01:26:39,299 --> 01:26:43,352
<i>Look, those two yellow
zinnias on this end</i>

1061
01:26:43,519 --> 01:26:45,065
<i>aren't as tall as they were,</i>

1062
01:26:45,232 --> 01:26:48,115
<i>Since when do flowers
grow shorter in two weeks?</i>

1063
01:26:48,616 --> 01:26:52,251
- There's something buried there.
- Mrs Thorwald.

1064
01:26:52,419 --> 01:26:55,635
You haven't spent much time
around cemeteries, have you?

1065
01:26:55,803 --> 01:26:58,644
Mr Thorwald could scarcely
put his wife's body

1066
01:26:58,811 --> 01:27:01,945
in a plot of ground
about one foot square.

1067
01:27:02,112 --> 01:27:04,744
Unless, of course, he put
her in standing on end,

1068
01:27:04,912 --> 01:27:07,543
and then he wouldn't
need a knife and saw.

1069
01:27:07,711 --> 01:27:11,304
No, my idea is she's
scattered all over town.

1070
01:27:11,471 --> 01:27:13,895
- Leg in the East River
- - Oh, Stella, please!

1071
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,608
No, no, no. There's something in there.

1072
01:27:15,775 --> 01:27:17,906
Those flowers have been
taken out and put back in.

1073
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:19,665
- Maybe it's the
knife and saw. - Yeah -

1074
01:27:19,832 --> 01:27:22,089
- Call Lieutenant Doyle.
- No, let's wait.

1075
01:27:22,256 --> 01:27:25,808
Let's wait till it gets a little darker,
and I'll go over there and dig them up.

1076
01:27:25,975 --> 01:27:30,655
<i>You'll go? You won't dig anything
up and get your neck broken.</i>

1077
01:27:30,822 --> 01:27:32,786
No, no, we've...

1078
01:27:32,953 --> 01:27:36,129
We're not gonna call Doyle until
I can produce Mrs Thorwald's body.

1079
01:27:36,297 --> 01:27:39,054
What we've got to do is find a
way to get into that apartment.

1080
01:27:39,221 --> 01:27:40,601
He's packing.

1081
01:27:41,645 --> 01:27:42,732
<i>Uh-oh,</i>

1082
01:27:43,149 --> 01:27:45,615
Here, get me a pencil.

1083
01:27:46,366 --> 01:27:49,627
Stella, get me some note
paper. It's up here someplace.

1084
01:27:49,793 --> 01:27:51,172
There it is.

1085
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,818
<i>You did it, Thorwald, You did it,</i>

1086
01:29:14,829 --> 01:29:16,543
- Look out, Lisa. He's coming.
- You never should have let her do it.

1087
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:18,381
- If he ever - -
Look. Look. Look.

1088
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:40,737
Thank heaven that's over.

1089
01:29:45,124 --> 01:29:47,465
- Alright if I have a drink?
- Sure, go ahead.

1090
01:29:56,575 --> 01:30:00,252
<i>There's no doubt about it, He's
leaving, It's just a question of when,</i>

1091
01:30:00,419 --> 01:30:04,096
Mind if I use that portable keyhole?

1092
01:30:04,263 --> 01:30:07,773
Go ahead, just as long as you
tell me what you're looking at.

1093
01:30:14,334 --> 01:30:16,548
<i>- I wonder...
- Wonder what?</i>

1094
01:30:16,716 --> 01:30:19,014
<i>Miss Lonelyhearts just laid
out something that looks like</i>

1095
01:30:19,181 --> 01:30:21,145
<i>rhodium tri-eckonal capsules,</i>

1096
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:24,196
<i>- You can tell from here?
- I've handled enough of those</i>

1097
01:30:24,363 --> 01:30:26,702
<i>to put everybody in Hackensack
to sleep for the winter,</i>

1098
01:30:27,162 --> 01:30:30,714
- Does she have enough of them
to - - To make her rest easier -

1099
01:30:30,881 --> 01:30:32,887
<i>Wasn't that close?</i>

1100
01:30:33,723 --> 01:30:36,439
What was his reaction
when he looked at the note?

1101
01:30:37,066 --> 01:30:39,114
<i>It wasn't the kind of
expression that would get him</i>

1102
01:30:39,281 --> 01:30:40,827
a quick loan at the bank.

1103
01:30:40,939 --> 01:30:43,780
Jeff, the handbag!

1104
01:31:08,394 --> 01:31:10,609
Suppose Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring

1105
01:31:10,775 --> 01:31:13,492
is among the jewellery
he has in that handbag?

1106
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:16,375
Now, during the phone conversation
he held up three rings:

1107
01:31:16,542 --> 01:31:19,676
One with a diamond, one with
a big stone of some sort,

1108
01:31:19,844 --> 01:31:21,933
and then just a plain gold band.

1109
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,944
The last thing she would leave
behind would be her wedding ring.

1110
01:31:26,112 --> 01:31:28,285
Stella, do you ever leave yours at home?

1111
01:31:28,452 --> 01:31:33,676
The only way anybody could get that
ring would be to chop off my finger.

1112
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:38,816
Let's go down and find out
what's buried in the garden.

1113
01:31:38,983 --> 01:31:43,538
Why not? I've always
wanted to meet Mrs Thorwald.

1114
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:45,293
- What are you two talking
about - - You got a shovel?

1115
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,672
Of course I don't have a shovel.

1116
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:50,517
- There's probably one in the basement.
- If you're squeamish, just don't look.

1117
01:31:50,684 --> 01:31:51,729
Squeamish? I'm not squeamish.

1118
01:31:51,895 --> 01:31:55,489
I just don't want you two
to end up like that dog.

1119
01:31:55,657 --> 01:31:58,958
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont, he
might just have something there.

1120
01:31:59,125 --> 01:32:00,881
Just hold on. Here, take this.

1121
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:03,429
No sense taking any
chances in this thing.

1122
01:32:03,597 --> 01:32:06,146
Here, give me the phone book.

1123
01:32:06,939 --> 01:32:08,619
What for?

1124
01:32:08,654 --> 01:32:10,577
Maybe I can get him
out of that apartment.

1125
01:32:10,745 --> 01:32:12,166
We only need a few minutes.

1126
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:14,172
I'll see if I can get about 15 minutes.

1127
01:32:14,339 --> 01:32:16,722
- How?
- Thorwald.

1128
01:32:17,892 --> 01:32:20,108
Thorwald... Thorwald.

1129
01:32:22,281 --> 01:32:25,583
Chelsea 2-7099.

1130
01:32:26,711 --> 01:32:27,799
2-7099.

1131
01:32:27,966 --> 01:32:31,727
We scared him once, maybe
we can scare him again.

1132
01:32:31,894 --> 01:32:34,779
I guess I'm using that
word 'we' a little freely.

1133
01:32:34,946 --> 01:32:36,450
You're taking all the chances.

1134
01:32:37,203 --> 01:32:40,297
<i>- Shall we vote him in, Stella?
- Unanimously,</i>

1135
01:32:40,463 --> 01:32:43,431
2-7099. Look out.

1136
01:32:45,939 --> 01:32:47,945
Chelsea.

1137
01:32:49,241 --> 01:32:51,080
Chelsea.

1138
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:10,037
Go on, pick it up, Thorwald.

1139
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:14,258
<i>Go on, you're curious,</i>

1140
01:33:14,426 --> 01:33:17,227
<i>You wonder if it's your girlfriend
calling, the one you killed for,</i>

1141
01:33:17,729 --> 01:33:20,153
Go on, pick it up.

1142
01:33:23,498 --> 01:33:27,428
<i>- "Hello?"
- Did you get my note?</i>

1143
01:33:29,643 --> 01:33:31,567
<i>Well, did you get it, Thorwald?</i>

1144
01:33:31,733 --> 01:33:33,114
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

1145
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:35,203
<i>I'll give you a chance to find out,</i>

1146
01:33:35,371 --> 01:33:37,880
<i>Meet me in the bar at the Albert Hotel,</i>

1147
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:40,095
Do it right away.

1148
01:33:40,262 --> 01:33:43,440
<i>- "Why should I?"
- A little business meeting...</i>

1149
01:33:43,607 --> 01:33:46,658
<i>to settle the estate of your late wife,</i>

1150
01:33:47,453 --> 01:33:50,631
<i>"I... don't know what you mean,"</i>

1151
01:33:50,798 --> 01:33:52,720
Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald,

1152
01:33:52,888 --> 01:33:55,103
<i>or I'll hang up and call the police,</i>

1153
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:59,116
<i>- "I only have $100,"
- That's a start.</i>

1154
01:33:59,702 --> 01:34:03,590
<i>I'm at the Albert now,
I'll be looking for you,</i>

1155
01:34:22,738 --> 01:34:24,284
Come on, Stella, let's go.

1156
01:34:24,452 --> 01:34:25,998
One of you keep an eye on this window.

1157
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:29,844
<i>If I see him coming back,
I'll signal with a flashbulb,</i>

1158
01:36:04,452 --> 01:36:05,998
<i>"This is the doyle residence,"</i>

1159
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:10,514
Hello, this is L B Jefferies.
I'm a friend of Mr Doyle.

1160
01:36:10,681 --> 01:36:12,939
<i>- Who's this? - "This
is a baby-sitter,"</i>

1161
01:36:13,106 --> 01:36:15,906
Oh, uh... when do you expect them in?

1162
01:36:16,074 --> 01:36:20,505
<i>"They went to dinner
and maybe a nightclub,"</i>

1163
01:36:20,673 --> 01:36:22,429
I see, hm.

1164
01:36:22,596 --> 01:36:25,647
<i>If he calls in, have him get
in touch with L B Jefferies?</i>

1165
01:36:26,358 --> 01:36:28,281
I might have quite a surprise for him.

1166
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:31,375
<i>"Well, do we have your
number, Mr Jefferies?"</i>

1167
01:36:31,542 --> 01:36:35,555
<i>- He has it. Good night.
- "Good night,"</i>

1168
01:36:51,734 --> 01:36:55,873
<i>Ah, Stella was wrong
about Miss Lonelyhearts,</i>

1169
01:37:27,772 --> 01:37:30,740
Lisa, what are you... Don't...

1170
01:37:35,673 --> 01:37:37,220
Don't...

1171
01:37:46,047 --> 01:37:47,636
Lisa, what are you doing? Don't go...

1172
01:38:04,488 --> 01:38:05,784
Li...

1173
01:38:22,845 --> 01:38:26,358
Come on, come on! Get out of there!

1174
01:38:31,836 --> 01:38:35,725
She said ring Thorwald's phone
the second you see him come back.

1175
01:38:35,892 --> 01:38:38,025
<i>We'll ring right now!
Give her another minute,</i>

1176
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:45,343
<i>Alright, fellows, let's try
it once from the beginning,</i>

1177
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:47,016
<i>Miss Lonelyhearts,</i>

1178
01:38:47,183 --> 01:38:48,772
Oh, call the police!

1179
01:38:52,284 --> 01:38:54,751
<i>- "Operator,"
- Get me the police, sixth precinct.</i>

1180
01:38:54,919 --> 01:38:56,466
<i>"Yes, sir,"</i>

1181
01:39:08,467 --> 01:39:11,603
<i>Mr Jefferies, the music stopped her,</i>

1182
01:39:18,335 --> 01:39:20,552
What... Lisa!

1183
01:39:22,309 --> 01:39:23,480
Lisa!

1184
01:39:35,188 --> 01:39:36,944
<i>"Precinct Six, Sergeant Allgood,"</i>

1185
01:39:37,112 --> 01:39:41,962
Hello. Look, a man is assaulting
a woman at 125 West Ninth Street,

1186
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:44,303
second floor, at the rear.

1187
01:39:44,848 --> 01:39:46,227
<i>Make it fast!</i>

1188
01:39:46,395 --> 01:39:48,527
<i>- "Your name?"
- L. B. Jefferies,</i>

1189
01:39:48,695 --> 01:39:51,664
<i>- "Phone number?"
- Chelsea 2-5598</i>

1190
01:39:51,831 --> 01:39:52,877
<i>"Two minutes,"</i>

1191
01:40:12,822 --> 01:40:14,203
The door was open.

1192
01:40:29,257 --> 01:40:30,636
Oh...

1193
01:40:36,490 --> 01:40:39,627
- I told you...
- Oh, no!

1194
01:40:40,421 --> 01:40:42,387
Let go of me! Jeff!

1195
01:40:42,554 --> 01:40:45,607
<i>- Oh, no!
- Jeff! Jeff!</i>

1196
01:40:45,774 --> 01:40:47,363
Jeff!

1197
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:50,010
Lisa!

1198
01:40:50,045 --> 01:40:51,343
Stella, what do we do?

1199
01:40:52,599 --> 01:40:56,324
<i>- Jeff! Jeff!
- Here they come.</i>

1200
01:41:47,106 --> 01:41:49,116
<i>What's she trying to do?
Why doesn't she turn him in?</i>

1201
01:41:49,283 --> 01:41:52,591
- She's a smart girl.
- "Smart girl?" She'll be arrested.

1202
01:41:52,758 --> 01:41:55,773
<i>It'll get her out of there, won't it?</i>

1203
01:41:57,740 --> 01:42:00,294
<i>Look, the wedding ring!</i>

1204
01:42:05,527 --> 01:42:08,541
Turn off the light! He's seen us!

1205
01:42:18,213 --> 01:42:19,552
How long do you think he'll stay there?

1206
01:42:19,719 --> 01:42:23,822
Unless he's dumber than I think,
he won't wait until his lease is up.

1207
01:42:23,989 --> 01:42:26,083
Get my billfold out of the
drawer in the table there.

1208
01:42:26,251 --> 01:42:28,972
- What do you need money for?
- I'm gonna bail Lisa out of jail.

1209
01:42:29,138 --> 01:42:31,316
You could leave her
there till next Tuesday.

1210
01:42:31,483 --> 01:42:33,911
Then you could sneak
safely away as planned.

1211
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:39,019
- Yeah, let's see, $127.
- How much do you need?

1212
01:42:39,186 --> 01:42:42,745
Well, this is first offence
burglary, that's about $250.

1213
01:42:42,912 --> 01:42:45,885
- Lisa's handbag.
- Yeah.

1214
01:42:46,053 --> 01:42:48,271
- How much does she have?
- Fifty cents.

1215
01:42:48,439 --> 01:42:52,122
<i>- Here, take this.
- I got $20 or so in my purse,</i>

1216
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:53,337
<i>What about the rest?</i>

1217
01:42:53,504 --> 01:42:55,974
<i>When those cops see Lisa,
they'll even contribute,</i>

1218
01:43:01,626 --> 01:43:04,431
Just a minute. Hurry up!

1219
01:43:04,598 --> 01:43:07,035
<i>- Jefferies.
- "What is it now?"</i>

1220
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:10,004
Doyle, I've got something
really big for you.

1221
01:43:10,172 --> 01:43:12,099
<i>"Why did I have to return your call?"</i>

1222
01:43:12,267 --> 01:43:15,327
<i>"Look! Don't louse up my
night with another mad killer--"</i>

1223
01:43:15,494 --> 01:43:20,272
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Lisa's in jail. She got arrested.

1224
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:22,242
<i>- "Your Lisa?"
- My Lisa.</i>

1225
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:26,097
Boy, you should have seen her.
She got into Thorwald's apartment,

1226
01:43:26,265 --> 01:43:28,277
but then he came back and the
only way I could get her out,

1227
01:43:28,445 --> 01:43:29,492
was call the police.

1228
01:43:29,659 --> 01:43:30,791
<i>- "I told you -" -
I know you told me.</i>

1229
01:43:30,959 --> 01:43:34,102
She went in to get evidence,
and she came out with evidence.

1230
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:38,922
<i>- "Like what?"
- Like Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring.</i>

1231
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:43,280
If that woman was alive, she'd
be wearing that ring, right?

1232
01:43:43,448 --> 01:43:46,088
<i>- "Hm, It's a possibility,"
- A 'possibility'? It's a fact.</i>

1233
01:43:46,256 --> 01:43:47,932
He killed a dog last night

1234
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:50,992
because the dog was scratching
around in the garden. You know why?

1235
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:54,554
Because he had something buried in
that garden that the dog scented.

1236
01:43:54,722 --> 01:43:55,770
<i>"Like an old ham bone?"</i>

1237
01:43:55,937 --> 01:43:58,913
I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife,

1238
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:00,253
but I'll tell you this:

1239
01:44:00,523 --> 01:44:03,918
All those trips at night
with that metal suitcase,

1240
01:44:04,084 --> 01:44:05,383
he wasn't taking out his possessions,

1241
01:44:05,551 --> 01:44:08,610
because his possessions are
still up in the apartment.

1242
01:44:08,778 --> 01:44:10,957
<i>"'Do you think perhaps
it was old 'ham bone?"'</i>

1243
01:44:11,124 --> 01:44:14,057
And I'll tell you something else.

1244
01:44:14,225 --> 01:44:17,199
All the telephone calls he made
were long distance, alright?

1245
01:44:17,367 --> 01:44:20,845
Now, if he called his wife long
distance on the day she left,

1246
01:44:21,013 --> 01:44:23,233
after she arrived in Merritsville,

1247
01:44:23,401 --> 01:44:26,626
why did she write a card to him
saying she arrived in Merritsville?

1248
01:44:26,794 --> 01:44:28,596
Why did she do that?

1249
01:44:29,392 --> 01:44:31,739
<i>- "Where'd they take Lisa?"
- Precinct six.</i>

1250
01:44:31,907 --> 01:44:33,373
I sent somebody over
with the bail money.

1251
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:35,551
<i>"Maybe you won't need it,
I'll run it down, Jeff,"</i>

1252
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:39,533
Alright. Hurry up, will you? This
fellow knows he's being watched.

1253
01:44:39,699 --> 01:44:41,627
He's not gonna wait
around forever. Hurry up.

1254
01:44:41,795 --> 01:44:44,602
<i>"If that ring checks out, we'll
give him an escort, So long, Jeff,"</i>

1255
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:47,284
So long.

1256
01:44:54,449 --> 01:44:55,370
Hello, Tom.

1257
01:44:55,538 --> 01:44:58,387
I think Thorwald's left. I don't see...

1258
01:45:00,734 --> 01:45:02,200
Hello?

1259
01:47:34,172 --> 01:47:35,849
What do you want from me?

1260
01:47:39,347 --> 01:47:42,330
Your friend, the girl, could
have turned me in. Why didn't she?

1261
01:47:45,018 --> 01:47:48,758
What is it you want, a lot of
money? I don't have any money.

1262
01:47:52,791 --> 01:47:53,926
Say something.

1263
01:47:55,816 --> 01:47:58,044
Say something! Tell me what you want!

1264
01:48:01,867 --> 01:48:03,463
Can you get me that ring back?

1265
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:08,631
<i>- No.
- Tell her to bring it back,</i>

1266
01:48:08,799 --> 01:48:11,447
I can't. The police have it by now.

<i>Lisa! Doyle!</i>

1268

here as fast as I could.

Don't let anybody touch him. Get
me a medical bag from upstairs.

Lisa, sweetie, if anything
had happened to you -

1276
01:49:53,945 --> 01:49:57,462
- I'm alright.
- Gee, I'm proud of you.

1277
01:49:58,551 --> 01:50:00,644

1283
01:50:17,643 --> 01:50:22,374
Yeah. He said the dog got too
inquisitive, so he dug it up.

1284
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:25,179
It's in a hat box over in his apartment.
